updates to address failures in the Autopilot system, the carmaker’s
much-hyped and oft-abused driver-assistance program. But the recall
report published by the National Highway Transportation Safety
Administration shows regulators are willing to keep risky technology on
the road as long as the driver gets nagged enough.
</p>
<p>
What’s at issue with the recall is less Autopilot’s ability to brake and
accelerate and more its Autosteer functionality, which allows the car to
follow curves and make turns.
<a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2023/RCLRPT-23V838-8276.PDF" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According
to NHTSA</a>, “the prominence and scope of the feature’s controls may
not be sufficient to prevent driver misuse.”
</p>
<p>
That “misuse” has been well documented in the years since Autopilot’s
release. It began with Teslas being
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUAkEqh0pcU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“hacked”
with a water bottle</a> to allow drivers to keep their hands completely
off the wheel (and sometimes
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOV-5E81fuI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">their
bodies in the back seat</a>); after that, researchers found that
Autopiloted Teslas were involved in
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/06/teslas-using-autopilot-crashed-273-times-in-less-than-a-year/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">273
crashes</a> over a one-year period. Autopilot has been investigated in
<a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2021/INOA-PE21020-1893.PDF" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">almost
a dozen cases</a> of vehicles crashing into emergency vehicles, and just
this August, thousands of
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/21/tesla-breach-employee-insider/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Autopilot
complaints from German customers</a> were leaked to
<em>Handelsblatt</em>, a German business newspaper.
</p>
<p>
The initial NHTSA investigation began in 2021, and late this year U.S.
regulators met with Tesla twice to address fixes. The automaker
eventually decided to resolve the matter by voluntarily administering
the recall — while, according to NHTSA, “not concurring with the
agency’s analysis.”
</p>
<p>
While a 2 million-car recall isn’t something usually construed as a win,
in this case, U.S. regulators did not conclude the technology itself was
unsafe, and also determined that drivers are responsible for using
Autopilot safely. This is what Tesla has contended since the beginning,
and it’s a rebuke to safety advocates, many local legislators, and
lawyers representing accident victims and their families.
</p>
<p>
Both Tesla and NHTSA point out that Autopilot is similar to other Level
2 automated driving systems offered by competing automakers — although
these competitors have more cautiously waded into autonomy, building in
myriad restrictions and ways to track driver focus. That’s in contrast
to Tesla, which, despite ample contravening evidence and multiple
lawsuits, still hosts a
<a href="https://www.tesla.com/videos/autopilot-self-driving-hardware-neighborhood-long" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a>
of a Model X “self-driving” with no intervention from the passenger on
its website.

<h2 id="bidens-one-tax-credit-to-rule-them-all">Biden’s One Tax Credit
to Rule Them All</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDc4NzY3OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MTY5MDMzOH0.5WPr5kErEIRmzhBHCcBKxeEcOhNC9HeqAr63OhKD9hw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
This year may forever be remembered as the start of the American clean
energy manufacturing boom.
</p>
<p>
Since the beginning of 2023, companies have announced more than 150
separate investments in new and expanded factories to manufacture solar
panels, wind turbines, batteries, and other clean energy technologies in
the U.S., for a total pledged outlay of nearly $60 billion, according to
<a href="https://e2.org/announcements/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tracking
by the nonpartisan group E2</a>. And these factories won’t just be
assembling the final products. Entire supply chains have arrived on
shore.
</p>
<p>
This is all, of course, due to the Inflation Reduction Act, the historic
climate legislation President Biden signed in 2022. The projects
announced this year are on top of some 60 announcements made right after
the law passed.
</p>
<p>
But more specifically, these factories are the result of one program in
the law that has perhaps not been fully appreciated — the 45X tax
credit. The IRA’s X-factor, if I may.
</p>
<p>
In ecology, scientists refer to animals that have a disproportionate
effect on their ecosystem as “keystone species.” Beavers, for example,
engineer the landscape around them, creating habitat that allows certain
other plants and animals to thrive. If beavers suddenly disappeared,
those habitats and the creatures they supported would vanish, too.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, 45X is the “keystone” of the IRA, according to Harry Godfrey,
managing director at Advanced Energy United, an industry association
that represents a variety of clean energy companies. This one provision
engineers the ecosystems supporting three key technologies — wind,
solar, and batteries — by offering tax relief to U.S. manufacturers
producing components up and down their supply chains.
</p>
<p>
The goal is not just to lower the cost of these climate solutions, but
also to level the global playing field for American-made goods. Before
the end of the year the Treasury Department will propose new guidance on
how the 45X tax credit will work — for example, how the government will
prevent fraud and abuse of the program — but the basic mechanics
established in the IRA have given companies enough confidence to get to
work.
</p>
<p>
The size of the credit companies are eligible for is
<a href="https://business.edf.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/90/files/45X-Production-Credit-Amounts-By-Component-Types.svg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">specific
to each manufactured component</a>. Let’s look at how solar panels are
made, as an example:
</p>
<p>
<strong>1.</strong> At the top of the supply chain are the companies
that make polysilicon, the key material that helps transform sunlight
into electricity. Those producers will earn $3 per kilogram of
polysilicon fabricated in the U.S.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2.</strong> Next are the companies that buy polysilicon and turn
it into solar wafers, thin slices that are later stacked to produce
solar cells. They will receive $12 per square meter of wafer they
produce.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.</strong> The solar cell fabricators will receive a refund
based on how much electricity their cells are capable of producing, paid
out at 4 cents per watt, or $40 per kilowatt.
</p>
<p>
<strong>4.</strong> Producers of “polymeric backsheets,” a protective
layer applied to the back of the final solar panels, can earn 40 cents
per square meter.
</p>
<p>
<strong>5.</strong> Finally, companies that assemble the cells into a
solar panel and apply the backsheets will get $70 per kilowatt.
</p>
<p>
Advanced Energy United made a
<a href="https://info.aee.net/hubfs/2023%20Reports/Unleashing%20America%E2%80%99s%20Advanced%20Energy%20Future%20Lawmakers.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rough
estimate</a> of what those five incentives would mean for solar using
2018 manufacturing data. It found that 45X would reduce the cost of a
domestically produced solar panel by 41%. “That’s huge to the global
competitiveness of this industry,” said Godfrey.
</p>
<p>
There are additional incentives under 45X not even included in their
analysis. The program pays back 10% of the cost of producing the
aluminum that goes into the solar panel’s frame and into the inverter
that enables it to send power onto the electric grid, for example.
Producers of “torque tubes” and “fasteners,” the structural components
used to mount solar panels to a field or roof, are also eligible.
Inverter manufacturers qualify, as well.
</p>
<p>
There’s no per-company cap or annual funding limit on the tax credit,
and it will be in effect until 2032. But if it succeeds, it could become
self-sustaining, encouraging companies to come to the U.S. in the future
because that’s where the supply chain and workforce is. “Suddenly you’re
shifting the gravity back into the United States,” Godfrey told me.
</p>
<p>
Proponents of subsidizing a domestic clean energy manufacturing industry
tout benefits like job creation, economic development, and improving
U.S. energy security and independence. Renewable energy technologies
like wind and solar already inherently do this, as they reduce our
exposure to the price volatility of oil and gas, as when energy prices
spiked around the world in 2022 due to Russia’s war in Ukraine.
</p>
<p>
Diversifying supply chains and bringing them to the U.S. further
insulates the country from being overly dependent on China, which
currently controls some 60% of the manufacturing capacity of clean
energy technologies. Being so reliant on <em>any</em> one country is
risky — and when that country is China, a country with which the U.S.
has a longstanding rivalry, the risk is greater still. For instance,
China recently
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/graphite-batteries-trade-war-us-china" target="_self">restricted
exports of graphite</a>, a key mineral for electric vehicles, in
retaliation to U.S. export limits on semiconductors.
</p>
<p>
45X is not the only program in the IRA that encourages domestic
production. The consumer
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-tax-credit-china-rule-2024" target="_self">tax
credit for electric vehicles</a>, for example, which gives car buyers a
$7,500 discount on a new EV, only applies to models that were assembled
in the U.S., with at least 50% of their battery components made in the
country, too. But the IRA creates a push and pull dynamic — 45X provides
the push for that consumer-based pull to work.
</p>
<p>
“In order for these demand side credits to be effective, we need the
manufacturing capacity,” Thomas Boylan, regulatory director at the Zero
Emissions Transportation Association told me. “Broadly speaking, this is
what will make or break the success of some of these other credits.”
</p>
<p>
Treasury’s upcoming guidance will help clarify exactly which processes
and technologies qualify. But unlike some of the IRA’s other programs,
where the department has had to contend with big, industry-shaping
questions, like how a company can
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-treasury" target="_self">prove
it is using clean electricity</a>, the uncertainty around 45X is mostly
around small details.
</p>
<p>
For example, Boylan told me there’s some confusion in the industry about
who can claim which aspect of the credit. Can producers of critical
minerals claim 45X, or is the credit just for companies who buy the
minerals? And if one company is involved in multiple steps of the supply
chain, can they claim 45X for each one? There’s also uncertainty about
whether only producers of new materials are eligible, or whether, for
example, an electric vehicle battery recycling company can claim the
credit.
</p>
<p>
But as evidenced by the investment numbers, companies haven’t exactly
been waiting for the guidance to make moves.

<h2 id="the-cop28-deal-is-literally-meaningless-but-not-useless">The
COP28 Deal Is Literally Meaningless — But Not Useless</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDc4NzMyMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MTYwMjQwMn0.IQsNygH9eNynTodIYN_6yMNbhcdS3lFtiX-6kQM-_o0/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
As North America slept, delegates from around the world concluded the
global climate conference in Dubai, when the chair — local oilman Sultan
al-Jaber — quick-gaveled through an agreement that included a sentence
calling for “transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in
a just, orderly and equitable manner.”
</p>
<p>
That may not seem like much — it is, after all, the single most obvious
thing one could possibly say about climate change, akin to “in an effort
to reduce my headache, I am transitioning away from hitting myself in
the forehead with a hammer.” And by itself it will accomplish nothing.
As Samoa, speaking on behalf of the Small Island Nations, said a few
minutes later, “we have come to the conclusion that the course
correction that is needed has not been secured.”
</p>
<p>
But it is — and this is important — a tool for activists to use
henceforth. The world’s nations have now publicly agreed that they need
to transition off fossil fuels, and that sentence will hang over every
discussion from now on — especially the discussions about any further
<em>expansion </em>of the fossil fuel energy. There may be barriers to
shutting down operations (what the text of the agreement obliquely
refers to as “national circumstances, pathways and approaches”). But
surely, if the language means anything at all, it means opening no more
<em>new</em> oil fields, no more <em>new </em>pipeline. No more
<em>new</em> LNG export terminals.
</p>
<p>
In fact, that last point — export terminals for liquefied natural gas —
will almost certainly be the first real test of whether this agreement
means anything. The American envoy John Kerry, who celebrated his 80th
birthday during the talks, could be forgiven for thinking of it as a
crowning achievement. Though he acknowledged stronger language would
have been nice, “I think everybody here should be pleased that in a
world of Ukraine and the Middle East war and all the other challenges of
a planet that is foundering, this is a moment where multilateralism has
actually come together and people have taken individual interests and
attempted to define the common good,” Kerry said. “That is hard. That is
the hardest thing in diplomacy, the hardest thing in politics.”
</p>
<p>
But Kerry’s job isn’t done. He needs to return home and convince the
White House to pause the granting of new export licenses for the ongoing
LNG buildout, a project so enormous that by itself it could produce more
greenhouse gas emissions than all of Europe. If the White House agrees —
and Dubai saw the release of a
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uuGszOOFABFWEmcQrZugDCf7KS2omxebXePjFhJ8Zxc/edit" target="_blank">letter</a>
from 230 environmental organizations urging just such a pause — then we
will know there was something real in all this endless talk.
</p>
<p>
And in that case, the bland sentence — “transitioning away from fossil
fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner”
<strong>— </strong>would join at least two others in the long history of
the climate talks as historically significant.
</p>
<p>
The first came in 1995, when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change, in its second assessment report, said “the balance of evidence
suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate.”
That bland sentence — bland for the same reason, because it also had to
get past every government in the world — was the death knell for the
argument that climate change wasn’t real; after it, no serious person
(admittedly a category with many exceptions) could argue there was no
need to do anything.
</p>
<p>
The second came in 2015, in the preamble to the Paris accords, when (at
the urging of those same small island states) the text included a pledge
to “substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to hold global
temperature increase to well below 2 degrees Celsius above
pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees C
above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly
reduce the risks and impacts of climate change.” That recognition of 1.5
degrees changed the debate — but only because activists and scientists
used it to demand that governments and businesses identify a “1.5 degree
path,” which increased the seriousness of those plans. We’re not going
to stay below 1.5 degrees — but that sentence may, in the end, knock
half a degree off how much the planet warms.
</p>
<p>
If today’s sentence is to matter, it will need that same kind of
activism, especially since the fossil fuel industry — the most
well-represented ‘nation’ at the talks — managed to lard the text with
wiggle words. For instance, the agreement “recognizes that transitional
fuels can play a role in facilitating the energy transition while
ensuring energy security,” which the fracked gas industry is going to
interpret as permission for them to go on pumping. We need to insist
that the clear, plain meaning of the language is, the fossil fuel era is
over. No more new digging and drilling.
</p>
<p>
What I’m trying to say is, today’s agreement is literally meaningless —
and potentially meaningful. But the diplomats are done now — the rest of
us are going to have to supply that meaning.

id="pakistans-ex-leader-indicted-over-revealing-us-tied-state-secrets">Pakistan’s
Ex-Leader Indicted Over Revealing US-Tied State Secrets</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD — A special Pakistani court Wednesday indicted former Prime
Minister Imran Khan on unprecedented and disputed charges of disclosing
classified information involving the United States while in office.</p>
<p>The indictment has dealt a fresh blow to the incarcerated popular
leader’s chances of contesting national elections in February and
returning to power.</p>
<p>Co-defendant Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Khan’s deputy and a former foreign
minister, was also indicted for his alleged role in the case. Foreign
media representatives were not allowed to cover the legal proceedings,
while only a handful of local journalists were given access as
usual.</p>
<p>“The charges were read out loudly in the courtroom,” government
prosecutor Shah Khawar told Reuters, saying Khan and Qureshi both
pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>Khan’s lawyer, barrister Gohar Khan, disputed the indictment. He told
reporters after the hearing that “no charge was framed before us nor
signed by the accused.” The trial was being conducted “hastily without
ensuring transparency and fairness,” the lawyer alleged.</p>
<p>“Again, justice is being rushed, and whenever it is rushed, it is
always crushed,” he added. The defense attorney lamented the trial could
not be conducted openly and said most foreign and local media reporters
were barred from covering the proceedings in violation of a judicial
order.</p>
<p>“The criminal justice system of Pakistan is being used as a tool for
political victimization. We have had enough of it. This must stop,” he
said.</p>
<p>The court initially indicted Khan and Qureshi in October on the same
charges in closed-door proceedings, but a higher court scrapped the
process and ordered authorities to ensure an open trial and allow family
members and journalists to attend it.</p>
<p>The judicial proceedings are underway inside a prison facility near
the capital, Islamabad, for security reasons, the government says.</p>
<p>Legal experts say that a guilty verdict could result in a maximum
sentence of 14 years imprisonment or a death sentence.</p>
<p>The lawsuit stems from a classified cable, internally known as a
cipher, sent to Islamabad by Pakistan’s ambassador in Washington in
March 2022.</p>
<p>Khan alleged the cipher documented the United States’ role in the
toppling of his government a month later with the help of his country’s
powerful military to punish him for visiting Moscow a day before Russia
invaded Ukraine.</p>
<p>Both Washington and the Pakistan military deny the charges.</p>
<p>On Monday, the State Department spokesman again refuted allegations
the U.S. had anything to do with Pakistan’s internal affairs.</p>
<p>“The United States does not play any role in choosing the leaders of
Pakistan. We engage with the leadership shown by — or the leadership
decided by the Pakistani people — and we will continue to engage with
the government of Pakistan on all these issues,” Matthew Miller told a
news conference in Washington.</p>
<p>Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, party won the last general
elections in 2018, making him the prime minister for the first time.</p>
<p>The charismatic cricketer-turned-politician discussed details of the
cipher at party rallies and during media interviews in the run-up to the
controversial vote and continued doing so after his ouster.</p>
<p>Khan maintains he was doing so lawfully because he was duty-bound to
inform Pakistanis about “the foreign conspiracy” against the government
they had elected.</p>
<p>Since his removal from power, the ousted prime minister has faced
dozens of lawsuits filed by authorities, which he claims to be a ploy by
the military to prevent his comeback to power because of his advocacy
for an independent foreign policy for Pakistan, one free from the
influence of the United States.</p>
<p>Last August, Khan was convicted in a graft case and sentenced to
three years in jail. A superior court later suspended his sentence and
ordered the government to release him on bail, but authorities refused,
citing the cipher and other lawsuits against him.</p>
<p>Unless his conviction is overturned, the former prime minister
remains disqualified from running in the upcoming elections or leading
the PTI under election laws.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed
controversial military tribunals to resume trials of more than 100 Imran
Khan supporters on charges of attacking army properties during
anti-government protests last May.</p>
<p>The judicial order came less than two months after a five-judge panel
of the top court ruled against trying civilians in military courts. Khan
and his party maintain the military trials of political activists are a
violation of the constitution and are meant to scare their candidates
away from the upcoming polls.</p>
<p>The military has staged three coups against elected prime ministers
since Pakistan gained independence from Britain in 1947, and it ruled
the country for more than three decades.</p>
<p>Pakistani politicians, including former prime ministers, say the
unconstitutional military interventions have encouraged generals to
influence policymaking significantly, even when not in power.</p>

<h2 id="biden-congress-mulling-big-changes-on-immigration">Biden,
Congress Mulling Big Changes on Immigration</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden is taking a more active role in
Senate negotiations over changes to the immigration system that
Republicans are demanding in exchange for providing money to Ukraine in
its fight against Russia and Israel for the war with Hamas.</p>
<p>The Democratic president has said he is willing to make “significant
compromises on the border” as Republicans block the wartime aid in
Congress. The White House is expected to get more involved in talks this
week as the impasse over changes to border policy has deepened and the
funds remaining for Ukraine have dwindled.</p>
<p>“It’s time to cut a deal that both sides can agree to,” Biden’s
budget director, Shalanda Young, said Sunday on CBS’ “Face the
Nation.”</p>
<p>Republicans say the record numbers of migrants crossing the southern
border pose a security threat because authorities cannot adequately
screen all the migrants and that those who enter the United States are
straining the country’s resources. GOP lawmakers also say they cannot
justify to their constituents sending billions of dollars to other
countries, even in a time of war, while failing to address the border at
home.</p>
<p>Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, who is leading the
negotiations, pointed to the surge of people entering the U.S. from
Mexico and said “it is literally spiraling out of control.”</p>
<p>“All we’re trying to do is to say what tools are needed to be able to
get this back in control, so we don’t have the chaos on our southern
border,” Lankford said on CBS.</p>
<p>But many immigration advocates, including some Democrats, say some of
the changes being proposed would gut protections for people who
desperately need help and would not really ease the chaos at the
border.</p>
<p>Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, the top Democratic bargainer, said the
White House would take a more active role in the talks. But he also
panned Republican policy demands so far as “unreasonable.”</p>
<p>“We don’t want to shut off the United States of America to people who
are coming here to be rescued from dangerous, miserable circumstances,
in which their life is in jeopardy. The best of America is that you can
come here to be rescued from terror and torture,” Murphy said on NBC’s
“Meet the Press.”</p>
<p>Much of the negotiating is taking place in private, but some of the
issues under discussion are known: asylum standards, humanitarian parole
and fast-track deportation authority, among others.</p>
<p>A look at what they are and what might happen if there are
changes:</p>
<p>Humanitarian parole</p>
<p>Using humanitarian parole, the U.S. government can let people into
the country by essentially bypassing the regular immigration process.
This power is supposed to be used on a case-by-case basis for “urgent
humanitarian reasons” or “significant public benefit.” Migrants are
usually admitted for a pre-determined period and there’s no path toward
U.S. citizenship.</p>
<p>Over the years, administrations, both Democratic and Republican, have
used humanitarian parole to admit people into the U.S. and help groups
of people from all over the world. It’s been used to admit people from
Hungary in the 1950s, from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos during the latter
half of the 1970s, and Iraqi Kurds who had worked with the U.S. in the
mid-1990s, according to research by the Cato Institute.</p>
<p>Under Biden, the U.S. has relied heavily on humanitarian parole. The
U.S. airlifted nearly 80,000 Afghans from Kabul, the capital of
Afghanistan, and brought them to the U.S. after the Taliban takeover.
The U.S. has admitted tens of thousands of Ukrainians who fled after the
Russian invasion.</p>
<p>In January the Democratic administration announced a plan to admit
30,000 people a month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela via
humanitarian parole, provided those migrants had a financial sponsor and
flew to the U.S. instead of going to the U.S.-Mexico border for
entry.</p>
<p>The latest U.S. government figures show that nearly 270,000 people
had been admitted into the country through October under that program.
Separately, 324,000 people have gotten appointments through a mobile app
called CBP One that is used to grant parole to people at land crossings
with Mexico.</p>
<p>Republicans have described the programs as essentially an end run
around Congress by letting in large numbers of people who otherwise
would have no path to be admitted. Texas sued the administration to stop
the program aimed at Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.</p>
<p>What might change with asylum?</p>
<p>Asylum is a type of protection that allows a migrant to stay in the
U..S. and have a path to American citizenship. To qualify for asylum,
someone has to demonstrate fear of persecution back home due to a fairly
specific set of criteria: race, religion, nationality, membership in a
particular social group or political opinions. Asylum-seekers must be on
U.S. soil when they ask for this protection.</p>
<p>They generally go through an initial screening called a credible fear
interview. If they are determined to have a chance of getting asylum,
they are allowed to stay in the U.S. to pursue their case in immigration
court. That process can take years. In the meantime, asylum-seekers can
start to work, get married, have children and create a life.</p>
<p>Critics say the problem is that most people do not end up getting
asylum when their case finally makes it to immigration court. But they
say migrants know that if they claim asylum, they essentially will be
allowed to stay in America for years.</p>
<p>“People aren’t necessarily coming to apply for asylum as much to
access that asylum adjudication process,” said Andrew Arthur, a former
immigration court judge and fellow at the Center for Immigration
Studies, which advocates for less immigration in the U.S.</p>
<p>Some of what lawmakers are discussing would raise the bar that
migrants need to meet during that initial credible fear interview. Those
who do not meet it would be sent home.</p>
<p>But Paul Schmidt, a retired immigration court judge who blogs about
immigration court issues, said the credible fear interview was never
intended to be so tough. Migrants are doing the interview soon after
arriving at the border from an often arduous and traumatizing journey,
he said. Schmidt said the interview is more of an “initial screening” to
weed out those with frivolous asylum claims.</p>
<p>Schmidt also questioned the argument that most migrants fail their
final asylum screening. He said some immigration judges apply overly
restrictive standards and that the system is so backlogged that it is
hard to know exactly what the most recent and reliable statistics
are.</p>
<p>What is expedited removal?</p>
<p>Expedited removal, created in 1996 by Congress, basically allows
low-level immigration officers, as opposed to an immigration judge, to
quickly deport certain immigrants. It was not widely used until 2004 and
generally has been used to deport people apprehended within 100 miles of
the Mexican or Canadian border and within two weeks of their
arrival.</p>
<p>Defenders say it relieves the burden on the backlogged immigration
courts. Immigration advocates say its use is prone to errors and does
not give migrants enough protections, such as having a lawyer help them
argue their case. As president, Republican Donald Trump pushed to expand
this fast-track deportation policy nationwide and for longer periods of
time. Opponents sued and that expansion never happened.</p>
<p>What might these changes do?</p>
<p>Much of the disagreement over these proposed changes comes down to
whether people think deterrence works.</p>
<p>Arthur, the former immigration court judge, thinks it does. He said
changes to the credible fear asylum standards and restrictions on the
use of humanitarian parole would be a “game changer.” He said it would
be a “costly endeavor” as the government would have to detain and deport
many more migrants than today. But, he argued, eventually the numbers of
people arriving would drop.</p>
<p>But others, like Schmidt, the retired immigration court judge, say
migrants are so desperate, they will come anyway and make dangerous
journeys to evade Border Patrol.</p>
<p>“Desperate people do desperate things,” he said.</p>

<h2 id="california-is-headed-for-another-wet-winter">California Is
Headed for Another Wet Winter</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p>
The 2020s got off to a parched, smoky start in the West. But after three
years of unrelenting drought, 2023 brought the region some relief.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to a very snowy winter followed by a very rainy spring, the worst
of the Western drought receded rapidly in the early months of this year,
data from the
<a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DmData/TimeSeries.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S.
Drought Monitor</a> shows. The extent bottomed out in the early summer,
when only one-sixth of the West was experiencing any level of drought at
all. It’s crept upward since then to about 45% of the region, but still
— that’s the lowest drought level the contiguous Western states have
seen at this time of year since 2019.
</p>
<p>
Most remarkable, in some ways, has been California’s transformation.
After years with far too little precipitation, in 2023 California often
received far too much. A spate of
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/13/us/california-storm-atmospheric-river.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">atmospheric
rivers</a> early in the year dumped inches of rain on its lower
elevations and feet of snow in its mountains. In April, Hurricane Hilary
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-08-21/hurricane-hilary-obliterated-daily-rainfall-records-across-souther-california" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">smashed
rainfall records</a> across the southern part of the state.
</p>
<p>
Two years ago this week, 100% of California was drought-stricken; early
this fall, the last patches disappeared (though a small but declining
percentage of the state is still considered “abnormally dry”). This is
the first time drought has been absent from California since 2019. The
most recent time before that was 2011. Before that, it was 2006.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the uptick in Western drought since summer has been most
severe in
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/arizona-electricity-public-service-salt-river" target="_self">Arizona</a>
and New Mexico, where the vast majority of places are drier than usual
and conditions in some areas are becoming more severe. Temperatures in
Phoenix rose
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/heat-waves-2023?rebelltitem=22#rebelltitem22" target="_self">above
110 degrees Fahrenheit</a> on a record 55 different days between June
and September, including an historic 31-day streak that baked the city
for almost all of July, the
<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-weather/2023/09/22/extreme-heat-brought-record-breaking-summer-to-arizona/70931723007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Arizona
Republic</em> reported</a>. While the wet winter replenished some of the
Colorado River’s dwindling water supply, the temporary boost wasn’t
enough to avert imminent cutbacks among the Southwestern states that
depend on it.
</p>
<p>
This precipitation rebound won’t last, of course. The above-average
mountain snowpack that piled up from heavy winter snows and kept streams
flowing through the spring and into the summer is long gone now. And the
decline this year in infernos terrorizing the West is almost certainly a
blip in the trend toward ever more devastating fire years,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/12/08/wildfire-trends-pause-future-climate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The
Washington Post</em> reported</a> last week. If historic patterns hold
true, there might not be another fire season this quiet for decades.
</p>
<p>
“We have just had a respite,” Tonya Graham, the mayor of Ashland, Ore.,
told the <em>Post</em>. “We have had a little bit of breathing space in
this trajectory that is taking us toward higher wildfire and smoke risk
and more extreme temperatures.”
</p>
<p>
But that rest doesn’t look to be over for everyone just yet. Snowpack is
already starting to accumulate again. And the National Weather Service
<a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/long_range/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">forecasts</a>
that at least in California and neighboring states, there’s a good
chance precipitation will stay higher than normal through the winter.

Housing is a labor issue (13 Dec 2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Housing is a labor issue: The eternal labor September
bodes well for the American housing crisis. Hey look at this: Delights
to delectate. This day in history: 2003, 2008, 2015, 2018, 2022
Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current
writing projects, current reading Housing is a labor issue (permalink)
There’s a reason Reagan declared war on unions before he declared war on
everything else – environmental protection, health care, consumer
rights, financial regulation. Unions are how working people fight for a
better world for all of us. They’re how everyday people come together to
resist oligarchy, extraction and exploitation. Take the 2019 LA
teachers’ strike. As Jane McAlevey writes in A Collective Bargain, the
LA teachers didn’t just win higher pay for their members! They also
demanded (and got) an end to immigration sweeps of parents waiting for
their kids at the school gate; a guarantee of green space near every
public school in the city; and on-site immigration counselors in LA
schools: https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/23/a-collective-bargain/
Unionization is enjoying an historic renaissance. The Hot Labor Summer
transitioned to an Eternal Labor September, and it’s still going strong,
with UAW president Shawn Fain celebrating his members victory over the
Big Three automakers by calling for a 2028 general strike:
https://www.teenvogue.com/story/uaw-general-strike-no-class The rising
labor movement has powerful allies in the Biden Administration. NLRB
general counsel Jennifer Abruzzo is systematically gutting the “union
avoidance” playbook. She’s banned the use of temp-work app blacklists
that force workers to cross picket lines:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/30/computer-says-scab/#instawork She’s
changed the penalty for bosses who violate labor law during union
drives. It used to be the boss would pay a fine, which was an easy price
to pay in exchange for killing your workers’ union. Now, the penalty is
automatic recognition of the union:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/06/goons-ginks-and-company-finks/#if-blood-be-the-price-of-your-cursed-wealth
And while the law doesn’t allow Abruzzo to impose a contract on
companies that refuse to bargain their unions, she’s set to force those
companies to honor other employers’ union contracts until they agree to
a contract with their own workers:
https://onlabor.org/gc-abruzzo-just-asked-the-nlrb-to-overturn-ex-cell-o-heres-why-that-matters/
She’s also nuking TRAPs, the deals that force workers to repay their
employers for their “training expenses” if they have the audacity to
quit and get a better job somewhere else:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/14/prop-22-never-again/#norms-code-laws-markets
(As with every aspect of the Biden White House, its labor policy is
contradictory and self-defeating, with other Biden appointees working to
smash worker power, including when Biden broke the railworkers’ strike:)
https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/18/co-determination/#now-make-me-do-it A
surging labor movement opens up all kinds of possibilities for a better
world. Writing for the Law and Political Economy Project, UNITE Here
attorney Zoe Tucker makes the case for unions as a way out of America’s
brutal housing crisis:
https://lpeproject.org/blog/why-unions-should-join-the-housing-fight/
She describes how low-waged LA hotel workers have been pushed out of
neighborhoods close to their jobs, with UNITE Here members commuting
three hours in each direction, starting their work-days at 3AM in order
to clock in on time:
https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1669088899769987079 UNITE Here
members are striking against 50 hotels in LA and Orange County, and
their demands include significant cost-of-living raises. But more money
won’t give them back the time they give up to those bruising daily
commutes. For that, unions need to make housing itself a demand. As
Tucker writes, most workers are tenants and vice-versa. What’s more, bad
landlords are apt to be bad bosses, too. Stepan Kazaryan, the same guy
who owns the strip club whose conditions were so bad that it prompted
the creation of Equity Strippers NoHo, the first strippers’ union in a
generation, is also a shitty landlord whose tenants went on a
rent-strike:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/20/the-missing-links/#plunderphonics So
it was only natural that Kazaryan’s tenants walked the picket line with
the Equity Stripper Noho workers:
https://twitter.com/glendaletenants/status/1733290276599570736?s=46
While scumbag bosses/evil landlords like Kazaryan deal out misery
retail, one apartment building at a time, the wholesale destruction of
workers’ lives comes from private equity giants who are the most
prolific source of TRAPs, robo-scabbing apps, illegal union busting, and
indefinite contract delays – and these are the very same PE firms that
are buying up millions of single-family homes and turning them into
slums:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/08/wall-street-landlords/#the-new-slumlords
Tucker’s point is that when a worker clocks out of their bad job,
commutes home for three hours, and gets back to their
black-mold-saturated, overpriced apartment to find a notice of a new
junk fee (like a surcharge for paying your rent in cash, by check, or by
direct payment), they’re fighting the very same corporations. Unions who
defend their workers’ right to shelter do every tenant a service. A
coalition of LA unions succeeded in passing Measure ULA, which uses a
surcharge on real estate transactions over $5m to fund “the largest
municipal housing program in the country”:
https://unitedtohousela.com/app/uploads/2022/05/LA_City_Affordable_Housing_Petition_H.pdf
LA unions are fighting for rules to limit Airbnbs and other platforms
that transform the city’s rental stock into illegal, unlicensed hotels:
https://upgo.lab.mcgill.ca/publication/strs-in-los-angeles-2022/Wachsmuth_LA_2022.pdf
And the hotel workers organized under UNITE Here are fighting their own
employers: the hoteliers who are aggressively buying up residences,
evicting their long-term tenants, tearing down the building and putting
up a luxury hotel. They got LA council to pass a law requiring hotels to
build new housing to replace any residences they displace:
https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-11-28/airbnb-operators-would-need-police-permit-in-l-a-under-proposed-law
UNITE Here is bargaining for a per-room hotel surcharge to fund housing
specifically for hotel workers, so the people who change the sheets and
clean the toilets don’t have to waste six hours a day commuting to do
so. Labor unions and tenant unions have a long history of collaboration
in the USA. NYC’s first housing coop was midwifed by the Amalgamated
Clothing Workers of America in 1927. The Penn South coop was created by
the International Ladies Garment Workers’ Union. The 1949 Federal
Housing Act passed after American unions pushed hard for it:
http://www.peterdreier.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Labors-Love-Lost.pdf
It goes both ways. Strong unions can create sound housing – and
precarious housing makes unions weaker. Remember during the Hollywood
writers’ strike, when an anonymous studio ghoul told the press the plans
was to “allow things to drag on until union members start losing their
apartments and losing their houses?” Vienna has the most successful
housing in any major city in the world. It’s the city where people of
every income and background live in comfort without being rent-burdened
and without worry about eviction, mold, or leaks. That’s the legacy of
Red Vienna, the Austrian period of Social Democratic Workers’ Party rule
and built vast tracts of high-quality public housing. The system was so
robust that it rebounded after World War II and continues to this day:
https://www.politico.eu/article/vienna-social-housing-architecture-austria-stigma/
Today, the rest of the world is mired in a terrible housing crisis. It’s
not merely that the rent’s too damned high (though it is) – housing
precarity is driving dangerous political instability:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/06/the-rents-too-damned-high/ Turning
the human necessity of shelter into a market commodity is a failure. The
economic orthodoxy that insists that public housing, rent control, and
high-density zoning will lead to less housing has failed. rent control
works:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/16/mortgages-are-rent-control/#housing-is-a-human-right-not-an-asset
Leaving housing to the market only produces losers. If you have the bad
luck to invest everything you have into a home in a city that contracts,
you’re wiped out. If you have the bad luck into invest everything into a
home in a “superstar city” where prices go up, you also lose, because
your city becomes uninhabitable and your children can’t afford to live
there: https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/27/lethal-dysfunction/#yimby A
strong labor movement is the best chance we have for breaking the
housing deadlock. And housing is just for starters. Labor is the key to
opening every frozen-in-place dysfunction. Take care work: the aging,
increasingly chronically ill American population is being tortured and
murdered by private equity hospices, long-term care facilities and
health services that have been rolled up by the same private equity
firms that destroyed work and housing:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/26/death-panels/#what-the-heck-is-going-on-with-CMS
In her interview with Capital &amp; Main’s Jessica Goodheart, National
Domestic Workers Alliance president Ai-jen Poo describes how making
things better for care workers will make things better for everyone:
https://prospect.org/labor/2023-12-13-labor-leader-ai-jen-poo-interview/
Care work is a “triple dignity investment”: first, it makes life better
for the worker (most often a woman of color), then, it allows family
members of people who need care to move into higher paid work; and of
course, it makes life better for people who need care: “It delivers
human potential and agency. It delivers a future workforce. It delivers
quality of life.” The failure to fund care work is a massive driver of
inequality. America’s sole federal public provision for care is
Medicaid, which only kicks in after a family it totally impoverished.
Funding care with tax increases polls high with both Democrats and
Republicans, making it good politics:
https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2021/4/7/voters-support-investing-in-the-care-economy
Congress stripped many of the care provisions from Build Back Better,
missing a chance for an “unprecedented, transformational investment in
care.” But the administrative agencies picked up where Congress failed,
following a detailed executive order that identifies existing,
previously unused powers to improve care in America. The EO “expands
access to care, supports family caregivers and improves wages and
conditions for the workforce”:
https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/04/18/executive-order-on-increasing-access-to-high-quality-care-and-supporting-caregivers/
States are also filling the void. Washington just created a long-term
care benefit:
https://apnews.com/article/washington-long-term-care-tax-disability-cb54b04b025223dbdba7199db1d254e4
New Mexicans passed a ballot initiative that establishes permanent
funding for child care:
https://www.cwla.org/new-mexico-votes-for-child-care/ New York care
workers won a $3/hour across the board raise:
https://inequality.org/great-divide/new-york-budget-fair-pay-home-care/
The fight is being led by women of color, and they’re kicking ass – and
they’re doing it through their unions. Worker power is the foundation
that we build a better world upon, and it’s surging. Hey look at this

Debugging its database was several orders of magnitude less work than
the Node+SQL setup where the runtime and the database are very far
apart. In Frontier the database and the language are the same thing. And
because Frontier did the rational thing with synchronization, it was
handled in the kernel, the code you write doesn’t have to worry about
it, you can write reasonably readable code. In Node it’s a real chore to
come back to some code you worked on last a while back. Makes my mind
tired, but I do it, because it’s where I work now.</p>

House Approves Impeachment Inquiry Into President Biden</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The House on Wednesday authorized the impeachment
inquiry into President Joe Biden, with every Republican rallying behind
the politically charged process despite lingering concerns among some in
the party that the investigation has yet to produce evidence of
misconduct by the president.</p>
<p>The 221-212 party-line vote put the entire House Republican
conference on record in support of an impeachment process that can lead
to the ultimate penalty for a president: punishment for what the
Constitution describes as “high crimes and misdemeanors,” which can lead
to removal from office if convicted in a Senate trial.</p>
<p>Authorizing the months-long inquiry ensures that the impeachment
investigation extends well into 2024, when Biden will be running for
reelection and seems likely to be squaring off against former President
Donald Trump — who was twice impeached during his time in the White
House. Trump has pushed his GOP allies in Congress to move swiftly on
impeaching Biden, part of his broader calls for vengeance and
retribution against his political enemies.</p>
<p>The decision to hold a vote came as House Speaker Mike Johnson and
his leadership team faced growing pressure to show progress in what has
become a nearly yearlong probe centered around the business dealings of
Biden’s family members. While their investigation has raised ethical
questions, no evidence has emerged that Biden acted corruptly or
accepted bribes in his current role or previous office as vice
president.</p>
<p>Ahead of the vote, Johnson called it “the next necessary step” and
acknowledged there are “a lot of people who are frustrated this hasn’t
moved faster.”</p>
<p>In a recent statement, the White House called the whole process a
“baseless fishing expedition” that Republicans are pushing ahead with
“despite the fact that members of their own party have admitted there is
no evidence to support impeaching President Biden.”</p>
<p>House Democrats rose in opposition to the inquiry resolution
Wednesday.</p>
<p>“This whole thing is an extreme political stunt. It has no
credibility, no legitimacy, and no integrity. It is a sideshow,”
Democratic Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts said during a
floor debate.</p>
<p>Some House Republicans, particularly those hailing from politically
divided districts, had been hesitant in recent weeks to take any vote on
Biden’s impeachment, fearing a significant political cost. But GOP
leaders have made the case in recent weeks that the resolution is only a
step in the process, not a decision to impeach Biden. That message seems
to have won over skeptics.</p>
<p>“As we have said numerous times before, voting in favor of an
impeachment inquiry does not equal impeachment,” Representative Tom
Emmer, a member of the GOP leadership team, said at a news conference
Tuesday.</p>
<p>Emmer said Republicans “will continue to follow the facts wherever
they lead, and if they uncover evidence of treason, bribery or other
high crimes and misdemeanors, then and only then will the next steps
towards impeachment proceedings be considered.”</p>
<p>Most of the Republicans reluctant to back the impeachment push have
also been swayed by leadership’s recent argument that authorizing the
inquiry will give them better legal standing as the White House has
questioned the legal and constitutional basis for their requests for
information.</p>
<p>Representative Dusty Johnson, a Republican from South Dakota, said
this week that while there was no evidence to impeach the president,
“that’s also not what the vote this week would be about.”</p>
<p>House Democrats remained unified in their opposition to the
impeachment process, saying it is a farce used by the GOP to take
attention away from Trump and his legal woes.</p>
<p>“You don’t initiate an impeachment process unless there’s real
evidence of impeachable offenses,” said Representative Jerry Nadler, the
ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, who oversaw the two
impeachments into Trump. “There is none here. None.”</p>
<p>Democrats and the White House have repeatedly defended the president
and his administration’s cooperation with the investigation thus far,
saying it has already made a massive trove of documents available.</p>
<p>Congressional investigators have obtained nearly 40,000 pages of
subpoenaed bank records and dozens of hours of testimony from key
witnesses, including several high-ranking Justice Department officials
currently tasked with investigating the president’s son, Hunter
Biden.</p>
<p>While Republicans say their inquiry is ultimately focused on the
president himself, they have taken particular interest in Hunter Biden
and his overseas business dealings, from which they accuse the president
of personally benefiting. Republicans have also focused a large part of
their investigation on whistleblower allegations of interference in the
long-running Justice Department investigation into the younger Biden’s
taxes and his gun use.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden is currently facing criminal charges in two states from
the special counsel investigation. He’s charged with firearm counts in
Delaware, alleging he broke laws against drug users having guns in 2018,
a period when he has acknowledged struggling with addiction. Special
counsel David Weiss filed additional charges last week, alleging he
failed to pay about $1.4 million in taxes over a three-year period.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden arrived for a rare public statement outside the U.S.
Capitol on Wednesday, saying he would not be appearing for his scheduled
private deposition that morning. The president’s son defended himself
against years of GOP attacks and said his father has had no financial
involvement in his business affairs.</p>
<p>His attorney has offered for Biden to testify publicly, citing
concerns about Republicans manipulating any private testimony.</p>
<p>“Republicans do not want an open process where Americans can see
their tactics, expose their baseless inquiry, or hear what I have to
say,” Biden said outside the Capitol. “What are they afraid of? I am
here.”</p>

Supreme Court to Rule on Limits on Commonly Used Abortion
Medication</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. Supreme Court agreed on Wednesday to take up a
dispute over a medication used in the most common method of abortion in
the United States, its first abortion case since it overturned Roe v.
Wade last year.</p>
<p>The justices will hear appeals from the Biden administration and the
maker of the drug mifepristone asking the high court to reverse an
appellate ruling that would cut off access to the drug through the mail
and impose other restrictions, even in states where abortion remains
legal. The restrictions include shortening from the current 10 weeks to
seven weeks the time during which mifepristone can be used in
pregnancy.</p>
<p>The nine justices did not take up a separate appeal from abortion
opponents who challenged the Food and Drug Administration’s initial
approval of mifepristone as safe and effective in 2000.</p>
<p>The case will be argued in the spring, with a decision likely by late
June, in the middle of the 2024 presidential and congressional
campaigns.</p>
<p>Mifepristone, made by New York-based Danco Laboratories, is one of
two drugs used in medication abortions, which account for more than half
of all abortions in the United States. More than 5 million people have
used it since 2000.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion
in June 2022. That ruling has led to bans on abortion at all stages of
pregnancy in 14 states, with some exceptions, and once cardiac activity
can be detected, which is around six weeks, in two others.</p>
<p>Abortion opponents filed their challenge to mifepristone the
following November and initially won a sweeping ruling six months later
revoking the drug’s approval entirely. The appeals court left intact the
FDA’s initial approval of mifepristone. But it would reverse changes
regulators made in 2016 and 2021 that eased some conditions for
administering the drug.</p>
<p>The justices blocked that ruling from taking effect while the case
played out, though Justices Samuel Alito, the author of last year’s
decision overturning Roe, and Clarence Thomas said they would have
allowed some restrictions to take effect while the case proceeded.</p>
<p>Women seeking to end their pregnancies in the first 10 weeks without
more invasive surgical abortion can take mifepristone, along with
misoprostol. The FDA has eased the terms of mifepristone’s use over the
years, including allowing it to be sent through the mail in states that
allow access.</p>
<p>In its appeal, the Democratic administration said the appeals court
ignored the FDA’s scientific judgment about mifepristone’s safety and
effectiveness since its approval in 2000.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the anti-abortion medical groups and individual
physicians who have challenged the use of mifepristone had urged the
Supreme Court to turn away the appeals.</p>
<p>“The modest decision below merely restores the common-sense
safeguards under which millions of women have taken chemical abortion
drugs,” wrote lawyers for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which
describes itself as a Christian law firm. The lead attorney on the
Supreme Court filing is Erin Hawley, wife of Republican Sen. Josh Hawley
of Missouri.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, an appointee of President
Donald Trump in Texas, initially revoked FDA approval of
mifepristone.</p>
<p>Responding to a quick appeal, two more Trump appointees on the 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the FDA’s original approval would
stand for now. But Judges Andrew Oldham and Kurt Engelhardt said most of
the rest of Kacsmaryk’s ruling could take effect while the case winds
through federal courts.</p>
<p>Besides reducing the time during which the drug can be taken and
halting distribution through the mail, patients who are seeking
medication abortions would have had to make three in-person visits with
a doctor. Women also might have been required to take a higher dosage of
the drug than the FDA says is necessary.</p>
<p>Health care providers have said that if mifepristone is no longer
available or is too hard to obtain, they would switch to using only
misoprostol, which is somewhat less effective in ending pregnancies.</p>

Supreme Court to Hear Case That Could Undo Capitol Riot Charge Against
100s, Including Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it would hear an
appeal that could upend hundreds of charges stemming from the Capitol
riot, including against former President Donald Trump. </p>
<p>The justices will review a charge of obstruction of an official
proceeding that has been brought against more than 300 people. The
charge refers to the disruption of Congress’ certification of Joe
Biden’s 2020 presidential election victory over Trump. </p>
<p>That’s among four counts brought against Trump in special counsel
Jack Smith’s case that accuses the 2024 Republican presidential primary
front-runner of conspiring to overturn the results of his election loss.
Trump is also charged with conspiracy to obstruct an official
proceeding. </p>
<p>The court’s decision to weigh in on the obstruction charge could
threaten the start of Trump’s trial, currently scheduled for March 4.
The justices separately are considering whether to rule quickly on
Trump’s claim that he can’t be prosecuted for actions taken within his
role as president. A federal judge already has rejected that
argument. </p>
<p>A lawyer for Trump didn’t immediately return a message seeking
comment on the Supreme Court’s decision to review the charge. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court will hear arguments in March or April, with a
decision expected by early summer. </p>
<p>The obstruction charge, which carries up to 20 years behind bars, is
among the most widely used felony charges brought in the massive federal
prosecution following the deadly insurrection on January 6, 2021, when a
mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a bid to keep Biden, a
Democrat, from taking the White House. </p>
<p>At least 152 people have been convicted at trial or pleaded guilty of
obstructing an official proceeding, and at least 108 of them have been
sentenced, according to an Associated Press review of court
records. </p>
<p>A lower-court judge had dismissed the charge against Joseph Fischer,
a former Pennsylvania police officer, and two other defendants, ruling
it didn’t cover their conduct. The justices agreed to hear the appeal
filed by lawyers for Fischer, who is facing a seven-count indictment for
his actions on January 6, including the obstruction charge. </p>
<p>The other defendants are Edward Jacob Lang, of New York’s Hudson
Valley, and Garret Miller, who has since pleaded guilty to other charges
and was sentenced to 38 months in prison. Miller, who’s from the Dallas
area, could still face prosecution on the obstruction charge. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols found that prosecutors stretched the
law beyond its scope to inappropriately apply it in these cases. Nichols
ruled that a defendant must have taken “some action with respect to a
document, record or other object” to obstruct an official proceeding
under the law. </p>
<p>The Justice Department challenged that ruling, and the appeals court
in Washington agreed with prosecutors in April that Nichols’
interpretation of the law was too limited. </p>
<p>Other defendants, including Trump, are separately challenging the use
of the charge. </p>
<p>Defense attorney Kira Anne West, who has represented several January
6 defendants charged with obstruction of an official proceeding, said
the courts will have to “undo a whole bunch of cases” and adjust many
sentences if the Supreme Court rules in their favor. </p>
<p>“This is a watershed day,” she said. “In our world — defense lawyer
world — this is huge.” </p>
<p>West represents a man scheduled to be tried in early January on
charges including the obstruction count. She doesn’t yet know if she
will seek a delay until the Supreme Court resolves the challenge. </p>
<p>More than 1,200 people have been charged with federal crimes stemming
from the riot, and more than 700 defendants have pleaded guilty.</p>

<p>
After two weeks of intense negotiations and apparent stalemate in Dubai,
all 198 delegates swiftly approved a breakthrough climate
<a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2023_L17_adv.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">agreement</a>
this morning at COP28. The deal — a culmination of a two-year process
known as the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop28-global-stocktake-negotiations" target="_blank">global
stocktake</a> — isn’t perfect, and it was met with a mix of praise and
disappointment. United Nations climate chief Simon Stiell
<a href="https://twitter.com/simonstiell/status/1734847049038717421" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>
that while the deal doesn’t “turn the page” on fossil fuels, it marks
“the beginning of the end” of the fossil fuel era. Here are five things
worth knowing about the agreement:
</p>
<p>
<strong>1. It doesn’t call for a fossil fuel phase-out</strong>
</p>
<p>
The agreement avoids the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop28-global-stocktake-fossil-fuels-phaseout" target="_self">contentious
“phase out” wording</a> that nearly derailed the climate talks earlier.
But it does call on countries to accelerate the transition away from
fossil fuels this decade in pursuit of achieving net zero by 2050. This
marks the first time a post-oil and gas future has been mentioned in a
COP agreement, something that would have been “unthinkable just two
years ago,”
<a href="https://twitter.com/James_BG" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a><em>
Business Green</em>’s James Murray.
</p>
<p>
The text also calls for tripling renewable energy capacity, phasing down
unabated coal, reducing methane emissions, phasing out “inefficient”
fossil fuel subsidies, and accelerating zero and low-emissions
technologies including nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage.
</p>
<p>
“This sends a clear signal that the world is moving decisively to phase
out fossil fuels,”
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/13/climate/cop28-climate-agreement.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>
Jake Schmidt, the senior strategic director for the Natural Resources
Defense Council. “It puts the fossil fuel industry formally on notice
that its old business model is expiring.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>2. It appears to greenlight natural gas</strong>
</p>
<p>
The final text features a paragraph making it clear that “transitional
fuels” can play a role in the energy transition. This is likely a nod to
natural gas — a fossil fuel often labeled as “clean” compared with coal
but that leads to emissions of methane, an extremely potent greenhouse
gas. Environmentalists worry those emissions will put net zero goals in
danger, but “producers have long argued that gas should complement the
roll-out of intermittent renewables, replacing dirtier fossil fuels like
coal and oil,”
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-13/cop28-deal-signals-role-for-gas-in-transition-to-clean-energy?sref=a2d7LMhq" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a>
Stephen Stapczynski at <em>Bloomberg Green.</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>3. It uses ‘weak’ language</strong>
</p>
<p>
One of the biggest criticisms of the deal is that it only “calls on”
countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions, which some see as little more
than an invitation. “It is the weakest of all the various terms used for
such exhortations,”
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/13/climate/cop28-climate-agreement.html">said</a>
<em>CarbonBrief</em>’s Leo Hickman.

<strong>4. Saudi Arabia gave a nod of approval</strong>
</p>
<p>
Saudi Arabia was chief among major oil-producing nations to object to a
call for phasing out fossil fuels, so to eke out a deal, the COP
presidency had to find language that signaled progress on curbing
pollution without crossing Saudi Arabia’s red line. A source
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/reaction-uns-final-proposal-cop28-deal-2023-12-13/#:~:text=The%20deal%20is%20%22a%20menu,the%20context%20of%20sustainable%20development.%22" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a>
<em>Reuters</em> the Saudis agreed to the deal because it offers “a menu
where every country can follow its own pathway.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>5. It doesn’t do nearly enough on finance</strong>
</p>
<p>
The text lacks specific commitments from rich nations to help developing
nations transition away from fossil fuels. “Asking Nigeria, or indeed,
asking Africa, to phase out fossil fuels is like asking us to stop
breathing without life support,” Ishaq Salako, Nigeria’s environmental
minister,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/13/business/dealbook/cop28-climate-deal.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a>
<em>The New York Times</em>.
</p>
<p>
The theme emerging from the reactions seems to be that this deal is
good, but not nearly as good as it could have been. Former Vice
President Al Gore’s lukewarm reaction sums it up pretty well:

News)</p>
<p>Another time I blog about is when I figure something out that I’ve
been trying to understand for a long time, in some cases my whole life.
That still happens. The other day I found myself talking with a friend
about love, why when someone says “I love you” it doesn’t mean what it
seems to. Love comes from understanding someone well enough that you
know what they desire, what they ache to have, and you to try to help
them get it. See all the qualifications in that. Try. Help. Them. In
other words, you can love someone when you know them. And you don’t give
them what they want, you help them get it. You can’t love someone who
your whole idea of is based on a dream you have about them. That’s
different. Anyway, lots more to say about all this. It’s a recurring
topic. It might be the <i>only</i> topic. Someday they’ll invent an AI
that can analyze my writing and tell me if I’ve ever written for any
other purpose than being worthy of love.</p>

to Spend $700M on New Embassy in Ireland, Breaks Ground on New Embassy
in Saudi Arabia</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The Biden administration has notified Congress that it
intends to spend nearly $700 million to buy a former Dublin hotel,
demolish it and construct new buildings to turn the site into the new
U.S. Embassy in Ireland. The State Department also announced that it had
broken ground on a new embassy complex in Saudi Arabia as part of a
revamp of its diplomatic facilities in the Gulf.</p>
<p>The department informed lawmakers late Monday that it plans to buy
the former Jury’s Hotel in Dublin’s upscale Ballsbridge neighborhood for
$171 million. Associated costs, including the design and construction of
the new chancery and furnishing it, will bring the total to $688.8
million, according to a notice sent to Congress.</p>
<p>The 4.2 acre (1.7 hectare) property is located just a block from the
existing U.S. embassy in the Irish capital, which dates to the 1960s and
the State Department said “is well beyond its useful life, is too small
for our operational needs, and is not functional in its layout.”</p>
<p>The new compound will include the embassy, a residence for Marine
guards, support facilities and parking, the notice said. It did not give
an estimate for when the project would be completed but estimated that
there would be 189 employees at the new embassy in 2028, at least 109 of
whom would require office space.</p>
<p>The U.S. has been planning to relocate its embassy in Dublin for more
than a decade and the Ballsbridge site had been the expected site after
Irish authorities approved zoning and other changes for it last
year.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the department announced that it had broken ground on
construction of a new U.S. embassy on a 27.5-acre (11.1-hectare) site in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, that it acquired in early 2020. That cost, along
with the construction of a new U.S. consulate in Jeddah and planning for
a new consulate in Dhahran, was more than $1 billion.</p>

had a long chat yesterday with
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Guy+Kawasaki%22">Guy
Kawasaki</a>. Along the way he wondered how I find something to write
every day. The answer – I don’t find things to write, it doesn’t work
that way. I don’t sit down in the morning and say OK now I have to write
1000 words and it doesn’t matter what it’s about. If I have something to
say I say it. And as you can tell, I usually do have something to say,
because I’m always thinking and planning, trying to figure out what I
want, or if I already know, how to get other people to help me get
there. A lot of trial and error, let’s see if this way of putting it
works, or that one, etc. There’s a slogan for this –
<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/08/09/narrateYourWork.html">Narrate
Your Work</a> – and my work is narratable and creates its own record
because I do my work right
<a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/13.html#a140021">here</a>, because
much of my work involves other people. Actually all of it. And if I can
get the people I need to listen to me, ie read my blog, then we can work
together (a recurring theme) to make great communication systems out of
the web and avoid flushing our future down the toilet, which we always
seem to be doing.</p>

pretty sure federation in social media is the wrong bet. We have to
think more broadly. What are the benefits we want from interop in social
media. Federation isn’t itself a benefit. It’s an idea hatched by
techies who aren’t thinking about how people actually use these systems
and which features are valued and which are problematic. Imho, what’s
valued is the ability to publish something quickly, and without much
fuss, and follow others, again easily without having to have a deep
understanding of how these things are architected. No one but us
programming plumbers cares. I think the idea of <i>conversation</i> not
only is overrated, but it’s where all the problems are, where all the
abuse happens. If we focus on the benefits, quick dissemination of news,
and the power of the individual to choose their sources and share them
with others – that’s where the juice is. Imho of course, ymmv, praise

Both Spotify and Apple Music recently published their annual lists of
the most listened to artists and songs. Unsurprisingly, Taylor Swift
dominated. But delve deeper, and you can also start to see the influence
of social media and strength of growing international audiences. Plus,
as oil prices slide, COP28 comes to an agreement using the words “fossil
fuel” for the first time ever.

id="isolated-internationally-on-gaza-biden-delivers-rebuke-to-netanyahu">Isolated
Internationally on Gaza, Biden Delivers Rebuke to Netanyahu</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The White House — In a sign that the United States is getting
increasingly concerned over the scale of civilian casualties from
Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, President Joe Biden delivered a
public rebuke to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday, even as
he maintains staunch support for Israel.</p>
<p>“We have made it clear to the Israelis, and they are aware that … the
safety of innocent Palestinians is still a great concern. And so, the
actions they’re taking must be consistent with attempting to do
everything possible to prevent innocent Palestinian civilians from being
hurt, murdered, killed, lost, etc,,” Biden said at a press conference
during Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s visit to the White
House.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy is in the U.S. to lobby for military and economic aid for
his country’s fight against Russia’s invasion. Aid to Ukraine and Israel
are being blocked by Republican lawmakers who are demanding concessions
on U.S. immigration policy.</p>
<p>Biden has grown more vocal with his public criticism of Israel’s
military campaign that is now into its third month. Speaking off-camera
to Democratic donors for his 2024 reelection bid earlier Tuesday, Biden
said Israel is starting to lose support around the world because of its
“indiscriminate bombings,” according to a White House transcript of the
event.</p>
<p>Biden’s comment stands in contrast to those of White House officials
who say Israel has taken measures to make their strikes more targeted to
avoid civilian deaths.</p>
<p>“He’s [Netanyahu] a good friend, but I think he has to change. … This
government in Israel is making it very difficult for him to move,” Biden
said.</p>
<p>The president singled out Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s far-right
national security minister.</p>
<p>“Ben-Gvir and company and the new folks, they don’t want anything
remotely approaching a two-state solution,” he said. “They not only want
to have retribution, which they should for what the Palestinians — Hamas
— did, but against all Palestinians.”</p>
<p>He suggested Netanyahu will need to empower the Palestinian Authority
to become a partner in the peace process toward the two-state solution,
which Israeli hard-liners oppose.</p>
<p>“You cannot say there’s no Palestinian state at all in the future.
And that’s going to be the hard part,” Biden said, even as he
underscored that the U.S. will not do “a damn thing other than protect
Israel in the process.”</p>
<p>Biden said national security adviser Jake Sullivan will travel to the
region this week and meet with the Israeli war Cabinet to emphasize U.S.
commitment to Israel, as well as the need to protect civilian life and
ensure more humanitarian assistance into Gaza.</p>
<p>Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will also travel to the region to step
up international efforts to protect the free flow of commerce through
the Red Sea that has been disrupted by Iran-backed Houthi militants
attacking vessels heading into Israel.</p>
<p>Cease-fire resolution</p>
<p>Biden’s remarks came amid an overwhelming vote at the United Nations
General Assembly supporting a cease-fire in Gaza that further isolates
Washington. The vote in the 193-member world body was 153 in favor, 10
against and 23 abstentions.</p>
<p>“Our duty is to try to save the lives who are still alive by having
this resolution adopted and by forcing Israel to comply with it. And
those who are shielding Israel to comply with the global consensus,”
said Riyad Mansour, Palestinian permanent observer to the United
Nations.”</p>
<p>The vote followed a similar resolution in the U.N. Security Council
last week that failed due to a U.S. veto. There are no vetoes in the
General Assembly.</p>
<p>While General Assembly resolutions are nonbinding, they carry
political weight. U.N. member states are shaping “the narrative that the
U.S. is standing alone in opposing the cease-fire,” and “looking for
every means possible to create a sense of moral pressure on the U.S. to
change its posture,” said Richard Gowan, U.N. director of the
International Crisis Group.</p>
<p>“The Arab group at the U.N. wants to make the Americans nervous,” he
told VOA. “It wants to send the message that America is losing
international goodwill because of its stance.”</p>
<p>Biden’s critics say his unwavering support to Israel jeopardizes
Washington’s interests.</p>
<p>The administration is inflicting “deep damage and lasting damage” to
its ties with key countries beyond the Middle East, said Josh Paul, a
former U.S. diplomat who resigned in protest over U.S. policy of sending
arms to Israel without oversight.</p>
<p>“But also, where we are arguing, for example, in the United Nations
to gain the support of the Global South for our just condemnation of
Russia’s abhorrent invasion of Ukraine,” Paul told VOA. “We are also
going to lose votes if we are seen to be hypocritical, if we’re seen to
be walking away from our values.”</p>
<p>Administration officials and other supporters of Israel say they
support humanitarian pauses but that a cease-fire would allow Hamas, a
U.S.-designated terror organization, to regroup and plan future
attacks.</p>
<p>A cease-fire allows Hamas to have a legitimacy that it hasn’t earned,
said Julie Rayman, managing director of policy and political affairs at
the American Jewish Committee.</p>
<p>“It’s giving trust to terrorist leaders who have proven unequivocally
that they are not trustworthy,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>Hamas fighters stormed from the Gaza Strip into nearby Israeli towns
on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 200 hostages.
Gaza health officials say Israel’s military response has displaced at
least 2 million people and killed more than 18,000 in the bloodiest
campaign of the decadeslong Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
<p>VOA’s United Nations correspondent Margaret Besheer contributed to
this report.</p>

concludes electric car adoption is seeing “genuine exponential growth”
across the world and that EVs “are highly likely to dominate the global
passenger car fleet in the near future, less than a decade from today.”
After analyzing the uptake of passenger EVs across 17 individual
countries, Europe, and the world, the researchers believe that
“system-wide adoption” will happen much faster than other estimates
suggest. In Europe, for example, the researchers predict the majority of
passenger cars will be EVs by 2031. The findings, published in the
journal <em>PLOS One,</em> hint at “radical economic and infrastructural
consequences in the near future.”

Recalls Over 2 Million Vehicles to Fix Defective System that Monitors
Drivers Using Autopilot</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Detroit, Mich — Tesla is recalling more than 2 million vehicles
across its model lineup to fix a defective system that’s supposed to
ensure drivers are paying attention when they use Autopilot.</p>
<p>Documents posted Wednesday by U.S. safety regulators say the company
will send out a software update to fix the problems.</p>
<p>The recall comes after a two-year investigation by the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration into a series of crashes that
happened while the Autopilot partially automated driving system was in
use. Some were deadly.</p>
<p>The agency says its investigation found Autopilot’s method of
ensuring that drivers are paying attention can be inadequate and can
lead to foreseeable misuse of the system.</p>
<p>The recall covers nearly all of the vehicles Tesla sold in the U.S.
and includes models Y, S, 3 and X produced between Oct. 5, 2012, and
Dec. 7 of this year.</p>
<p>The software update includes additional controls and alerts “to
further encourage the driver to adhere to their continuous driving
responsibility,” the documents said.</p>
<p>The update was to be sent to certain affected vehicles on Tuesday,
with the rest getting it at a later date, the documents said.</p>
<p>Autopilot includes features called Autosteer and Traffic Aware Cruise
Control, with Autosteer intended for use on limited access freeways when
it’s not operating with a more sophisticated feature called Autosteer on
City Streets. </p>
<p>The software update apparently will limit where Autosteer can be
used.</p>
<p>“If the driver attempts to engage Autosteer when conditions are not
met for engagement, the feature will alert the driver it is unavailable
through visual and audible alerts, and Autosteer will not engage,” the
recall documents said. </p>
<p>Depending on a Tesla’s hardware, the added controls include
“increasing prominence” of visual alerts, simplifying how Autosteer is
turned on and off, additional checks on whether Autosteer is being used
outside of controlled access roads and when approaching traffic control
devices, “and eventual suspension from Autosteer use if the driver
repeatedly fails to demonstrate continuous and sustained driving
responsibility,” the documents say.</p>
<p>Recall documents say that agency investigators met with Tesla
starting in October to explain “tentative conclusions” about the fixing
the monitoring system. Tesla, it said, did not agree with the agency’s
analysis but agreed to the recall on Dec. 5 in an effort to resolve the
investigation.</p>
<p>Auto safety advocates for years have been calling for stronger
regulation of the driver monitoring system, which mainly detects whether
a driver’s hands are on the steering wheel. They have called for cameras
to make sure a driver is paying attention, which are used by many other
automakers with similar systems.</p>
<p>Autopilot can steer, accelerate and brake automatically in its lane,
but is a driver-assist system and cannot drive itself despite its name.
Independent tests have found that the monitoring system is easy to fool,
so much that drivers have been caught while driving drunk or even
sitting in the back seat.</p>
<p>In its defect report filed with the safety agency, Tesla said
Autopilot’s controls “may not be sufficient to prevent driver
misuse.”</p>
<p>A message was left early Wednesday seeking further comment from the
Austin, Texas, company.</p>
<p>Tesla says on its website that Autopilot and a more sophisticated
Full Self Driving system cannot drive autonomously and are meant to help
drivers who have to be ready to intervene at all times. Full Self
Driving is being tested by Tesla owners on public roads.</p>
<p>In a statement posted Monday on X, formerly Twitter, Tesla said
safety is stronger when Autopilot is engaged.</p>
<p>NHTSA has dispatched investigators to 35 Tesla crashes since 2016 in
which the agency suspects the vehicles were running on an automated
system. At least 17 people have been killed.</p>
<p>The investigations are part of a larger probe by the NHTSA into
multiple instances of Teslas using Autopilot crashing into parked
emergency vehicles that are tending to other crashes. NHTSA has become
more aggressive in pursuing safety problems with Teslas in the past
year, announcing multiple recalls and investigations, including a recall
of Full Self Driving software.</p>
<p>In May, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, whose department
includes NHTSA, said Tesla shouldn’t be calling the system Autopilot
because it can’t drive itself.</p>
<p>In its statement Wednesday, NHTSA said the Tesla investigation
remains open “as we monitor the efficacy of Tesla’s remedies and
continue to work with the automaker to ensure the highest level of
safety.”</p>

The loss &amp;#8212; handed down by a San Francisco jury on Monday &amp;#8212; is a blow to the two companies&amp;#8217; business model in apps, where they charge commissions of as much as 30% to software developers who typically have few other options.&lt;/p&gt;

<h1>
Bots, again
</h1>
<p>
I come home from a friendly meetup and notice that my tiny web-server
has a load of 80 instead of the usual 0.5. What the hell is going on? I
look at the logs of the last 24 hours and see an IP number with more
than 100 000 hits in the last 24h. What are they doing?
</p>
<p>
Whois tells me it is from the “Alibaba Cloud”. Oh yeah? What are the
Chinese trying to do on my site?
</p>
<p>
I start poking around. More and more IP numbers from all over the net
show up. Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud.
</p>
<p>
All right, so I’m blocking some of them individually as I go, but after
a while I realize that I probably have to block them at the network
level.
</p>
<p>
For the moment I’m also taking down one of the wikis that’s overloading
my server.
</p>
<p>
Just looking at the top 10 offenders for two of my domains, and running
whois on them to find the entire network they belong to, and checking
that it’s Alibaba or Tencent:

If I want this to be for the entire server and not repeat it for each
location, I guess I’ll have to use Apache rewrite rules.
</p>
<p>
While I’m doing this, I notice a new pattern… My wiki software allows
you to fetch a feed for every page. Either it contains updates to the
page (Oddmuse), or a feed of the pages linked (Oddmu). It’s for humans.
</p>
<p>
Of course some shit engineer decided that it was a good idea to scan the
web for all the feeds that are out there (so rare! so precious!) and to
download them all, forever (uncover the darknet! server our customers!)
and now I have to block IP number ranges, add robot agents to robots.txt
files (not all of them provide one), or block user agents (not all of
them provide a useful one) and I block and block and block (for the
environment! to avoid +2.0°C and the end of human civilization!) and all
this while I know that all these shit requests exist out there, for all
the sites, everywhere – a hundred thousand requests or more per day, per
site, wasting CO₂ – and what am I going to do, kill the feeds for humans
because some shit engineer decided to feed a machine?
</p>
<p>
I’m on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(franchise)#The_Butlerian_Jihad">Butlerian
Jihad</a> again.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and Virgin Media is downloading tons of PDFs I’m hosting? Are they
looking for copyright violations? On the blocklist they go.
</p>
<p>
And what’s this, Feedly is also downloading feeds like crazy, every few
minutes? Slow down, idiots. My news is not important. On the blocklist
they go. Or are you trying to train your stupid intelligence? Fuck this
AI training stuff. I already use “X-Robots-Tag: noimageai” but I guess I
should add even more HTTP headers to block even more engineers
overstepping boundaries?
</p>
<p>
Ah, and MonitoRSS going into overdrive, from the Amazon Cloud. Really, I
don’t think there are humans in the Amazon Cloud. Onto the blocklist
they go. Well, at least this IP range.
</p>
<p>
And who’s that VelenPublicWebCrawler, zealously collecting pages? Onto
the blocklists they go.

<p><strong><span class="citation" data-cites="Jessica">@Jessica</span>
Smith’s blog</strong> (date: 2023-12-13, from: Jessica Smith’s blog)</p>
<p>
The last few days have been really productive for me creatively. I’ve
made <em>so much</em> progress on a <strong>thorough</strong> outline of
book 2 of
<a href="https://www.jayeless.net/wiki/my-novel.html" title="a wiki page about my project">my
<abbr title="Work In Progress">WIP</abbr></a>, with proper through-lines
of narrative
tension,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
and I’m feeling really good about how the actual writing of it is going
to go. I also did a cold reread of book 1, and was really happy with it,
actually! I’d <em>even</em> say it’s about ready to start seeking out
feedback from other people 😬
</p>
<p>
And… what did I have to do to start making progress again? It seems like
the solution is simple:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
get a temporary reprieve from the neverending stress that is renovating
a house. (I swear I will have a blog post up about this one day)
</li>
<li>
close all social media apps and browser tabs.
</li>
<li>
close my web browser entirely, or have it open only for

so I have something to keep my hands busy when I’m thinking.
</li>
<li>
just reread the damn thing! yes, it takes hours, but it’s the only way
to reimmerse myself in the story from zero. (also, now that book 1 is
relatively polished, I genuinely enjoy it! almost like there’s something
to that “write what you want to read” advice.)
</li>
</ol>
<p>
So there you have it; that’s what I’ve been up to. In what has otherwise
been a bit of a tough year for me, it feels great to be optimistic about
something for once 😊

id="russian-missile-attack-targets-kyiv-as-zelenskyy-pushes-for-us-aid">Russian
Missile Attack Targets Kyiv as Zelenskyy Pushes for US Aid</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The White House — A barrage of Russian missiles targeted Ukraine’s
capital, injuring at least 45 people Wednesday, as President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy urged U.S. officials to approve $61 billion in new aid to help
his country fight off Russia’s invasion.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s air forces said the country’s air defenses downed all 10
ballistic missiles launched by Russia.</p>
<p>Falling debris from the downed missiles damaged a children’s hospital
and the city’s water system, Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko said, while
Serhiy Popko, head of Kyiv’s military administration, said debris also
hit several homes.</p>
<p>“Russia has proven once again that it is a heinous country that fires
missiles at night, trying to hit residential areas, kindergartens, and
energy facilities during the winter,” Zelenskyy said Wednesday on social
media. “There will be a response. Certainly.”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy added that he and U.S. President Joe Biden had agreed to
work on increasing the number of Ukraine’s air defense systems, and that
Russia had “demonstrated how critical this decision is.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration Tuesday announced up to $200 million in new
military aid, including air defense missiles and components, for Ukraine
from previously approved resources.</p>
<p>The announcement came as Zelenskyy used his visit to Washington to
make a forceful case for a new commitment of $61 billion in aid to help
his country’s war cause as the U.S. Congress decides on the matter.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian leader rejected the notion that his nation would cede
territory to the Russians after nearly two years of brutal warfare.</p>
<p>“That’s insane, to be honest,” Zelenskyy said.</p>
<p>He added: “I don’t know whose idea it is, but I have a question to
these people: if they are ready to give up their children to terrorists.
I think not.”</p>
<p>Biden also pressed for Ukrainian victory and seemed to push back
against starting negotiations with Moscow.</p>
<p>“We need to ensure Putin continues to fail in Ukraine and Ukraine to
succeed,” he said. “And the best way for that to do that is to pass the
supplemental” funding request.</p>
<p>But the U.S. Congress, which signs the checks, is not yet convinced.
Earlier Tuesday, Zelenskyy met with lawmakers in an attempt to persuade
them.</p>
<p>Republicans say they want to see “proper oversight” of the funding,
and they also want to see “a clear articulation of strategy.”</p>
<p>Biden, meanwhile, accused Republicans of playing into Moscow’s hands
by failing to pass the aid package.</p>
<p>“The host of a Kremlin-run show said, ‘Well done, Republicans. That’s
good for us,’” he said, adding: “If you’re being celebrated by Russian
propagandists, it might be time to rethink what you’re doing. History
will judge harshly those who turn their back on freedom’s cause.”</p>
<p>Russia’s Foreign Ministry accused Zelenskyy of “cadging” – slang
meaning to beg for something undeserved – and said he is an American
puppet.</p>
<p>But U.S. taxpayers are showing signs of Ukraine fatigue, and some
Republicans question why about a third of U.S. money goes not toward
weapons, but government assistance.</p>
<p>John Jameson, a mine-clearing campaigner who recently visited the
country, said Ukraine needs every penny.</p>
<p>“The deminers were working while we heard the sound of artillery
going on,” he told VOA, on Zoom. “And they’re doing that because they
know it’s essential for them to be able to start farming and producing
and going back to work now so they can live so they can not only just to
fight the war but so they can live but no, we can’t wait until the
fighting is over.”</p>
<p>But when will it end? Analysts say this may take more than a year –
and question whether Ukraine’s supporters are funding it enough,
considering how well this small army has done against a much larger
foe.</p>
<p>“They’ve become, in some ways, victims of their own success,” said
Dalibor Rohac, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.
“I don’t think we should be sort of reasonably asking Ukrainians to do
more, especially given the almost homeopathic nature of Western
assistance. When you think about the amounts of munitions that are being
delivered – the miniscule amounts of long range artillery, precision
artillery, air defenses, etc, etc, that are being delivered to Ukraine.
I think they are making a really impressive use of very limited
resources that are given to them, provided to them, against a much
larger adversary.”</p>
<p>This urgent discussion comes as Biden on Tuesday announced another
$200 million in military aid for Ukraine from previously approved
resources.</p>
<p>Biden has asked Congress for a $110 billion package of wartime
funding for Ukraine and Israel, along with other national security
priorities.</p>
<p>But Republicans in the U.S. Senate have balked, saying major U.S.
border security changes are needed.</p>
<p>Some Republicans are asking for the immediate deportation of migrants
who entered the country illegally, stripping them of a chance to seek
U.S. asylum. They have also called for greatly scaling back Biden
administration programs that have allowed hundreds of thousands of
migrants to enter the U.S. lawfully.</p>
<p>The U.S. has already provided Ukraine $111 billion for its fight
against Russia’s 2022 invasion.</p>
<p>VOA’s Carla Babb contributed to this report. Some information came
from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.</p>

<p>If you ask a student on campus about what they eat on a daily basis,
they might joke and say that they survive on Cup Noodles. For a number
of students, there is some truth to that. According to a Health Affairs
survey, 30% of college students faced food insecurities. Prior to the

id="threat-of-violence-in-the-us-likely-heightened-with-holidays-approaching">Threat
of Violence in the US ‘Likely Heightened’ With Holidays Approaching</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Unabated anger and tensions over the ongoing conflict
between Israel and Hamas could spill over into the holiday season in the
United States, potentially putting large public gatherings at risk,
according to law enforcement and homeland security officials.</p>
<p>The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security late Tuesday issued a
public service announcement, warning of a heightened threat to holiday
or faith-based events and New Year’s Eve celebrations in the coming
weeks.</p>
<p>The announcement further warned of potential dangers to protests,
rallies and other First Amendment-protected events.</p>
<p>“Ongoing tensions related to the conflict between Israel and Hamas
likely heighten the threat of lone actor violence targeting large public
gatherings throughout the winter,” the statement said. “These targets
likely remain attractive to lone actors inspired by a range of
ideologies due to their accessibility and symbolic nature.”</p>
<p>According to the FBI and DHS, there is no specific or credible
intelligence to suggest an attack is in the works, but the statement
warns there has been “a spike in reporting on potential hate crimes or
other criminal violations” since the October 7 Hamas terror attack in
Israel that killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, with some 240
people taken hostage.</p>
<p>The Israeli military response has since displaced an estimated 2
million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, where the Hamas-run Health
Ministry says nearly 18,000 people have been killed, most of them women
and children.</p>
<p>The FBI and DHS warning said any escalation of the conflict could
“further exacerbate the threat of violence.”</p>
<p>Just last week, DHS issued a new guide to help faith-based
organizations, including churches, synagogues and mosques, take steps to
better secure their facilities and their congregations.</p>
<p>The same day, FBI Director Christopher Wray told U.S. lawmakers that
the bureau’s hate crime caseload had spiked by 60% since October, with
the majority of threats targeting the Jewish community.</p>
<p>The just-released public service announcement noted both the FBI and
DHS have also seen a jump in hoax bomb threats and active shooter
threats aimed at synagogues “likely intended to disrupt services and
intimidate congregants.”</p>
<p>The new advisory updates a previous warning from October 25.</p>
<p>U.S. homeland security officials have previously said the country has
been mired for more than a year now in a “heightened threat
environment,” with the biggest threat coming from U.S.-based extremists
motivated by “enduring racial, ethnic, religious and anti-government
ideologies.”</p>

win: jury decides Google has illegal monopoly in app store fight</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>Three years after Fortnite-maker Epic Games sued Apple and Google for
allegedly running illegal app store monopolies, Epic has a win. The jury
in Epic v. Google has just delivered its verdict — and it found that
Google turned its Google Play app store and Google Play Billing service
into an illegal monopoly. After just a few hours of deliberation, the
jury unanimously answered yes to every question put before them — that
Google has monopoly power in the Android app distribution markets and
in-app billing services markets, that Google did anticompetitive things
in those markets, and that Epic was injured by that behavior. They
decided Google has an illegal tie between its Google Play app store and
its Google Play Billing payment services, too, and that its distribution
agreement, Project Hug deals with game developers, and deals with OEMs
were all anticompetitive. ↫ Sean Hollister for The Verge Good news, of
course, but it does make one wonder why a judge in Epic’s case versus
Apple ruled the exact opposite as the jury did today. We don’t yet know
what this verdict will mean for Google in a practical sense – that’s up
to the judge, and Google intends to appeal, for course – so if consumers
will actually see any benefit from this remains to be seen.</p>

<p>As part of our transition to subscription and a simplified portfolio,
beginning today, we will no longer sell perpetual licenses. All

Additionally, we are ending the sale of Support and Subscription (SnS)
renewals for perpetual offerings beginning today. ↫ Krish Prasad of
VMware This sucks. Every few years, I would buy a cheap VMware license
on eBay for like €10 or something, to keep my Windows virtual machine
going for the incredibly rare cases where I need one for my job because
some popular CAT tools are Windows-only. I really do not wish to buy a
subscription for that. I guess it’s time to transition to
VirtualBox.</p>

to move location data and Maps history to your device</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Timeline feature in Maps helps you remember places you’ve been
and is powered by a setting called Location History. If you’re among the
subset of users who have chosen to turn Location History on (it’s off by
default), soon your Timeline will be saved right on your device — giving
you even more control over your data. Just like before, you can delete
all or part of your information at any time or disable the setting
entirely. If you’re getting a new phone or are worried about losing your
existing one, you can always choose to back up your data to the cloud so
it doesn’t get lost. We’ll automatically encrypt your backed-up data so
no one can read it, including Google. ↫ Marlo McGriff, Director of
Product, Google Maps, at Google’s official blog All else being equal,
moving location data from residing unencrypted in the cloud to on your
device is a good thing. That being said, if Google is giving up access
to this data, it most likely means they’ve gotten really good at
estimating your whereabouts using other data instead.</p>

Commerce Secretary Vows ‘Strongest Action’ on Huawei Chip Issue</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo vowed Monday to
take the “strongest action possible” in response to a semiconductor
chip-making breakthrough in China that a House Foreign Affairs Committee
said “almost certainly required the use of U.S. origin technology and
should be an export control violation.”</p>
<p>In an interview with Bloomberg News, Raimondo called Huawei
Technology’s advanced processor in its Mate Pro 60 smartphone released
in August “deeply concerning” and said the Commerce Department
investigates such things vigorously.</p>
<p>The United States has banned chip sales to Huawei, which reportedly
used chips from China chip giant Semiconductor Manufacturing
International Corp., or SMIC, in the phone that are 7 nanometers, a
technology China has not been known as able to produce.</p>
<p>Raimondo said the U.S. was also looking into the specifics of three
new artificial intelligence accelerator chips that California-based
Nvidia Corp. is developing for China. “We look at every spec of every
new chip, obviously, to make sure it doesn’t violate the export
controls,” she said.</p>
<p>Nvidia came under U.S. scrutiny for designing China-specific chips
that were just under new Commerce Department requirements announced in
October for tighter export controls on advanced AI chips for civilian
use that could have military applications.</p>
<p>China’s Foreign Ministry responded to Raimondo’s comments Tuesday,
saying the U.S. was “undermining the rights of Chinese companies” and
contradicting the principles of a market economy.</p>
<p>‘Almost certainly required US origin technology’</p>
<p>The U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee in a December 7 report
criticized the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, or
BIS, the regulatory body for regulating dual-use export controls.</p>
<p>The report said Chinese chip giant “SMIC is producing 7 nanometer
chips — advanced technology for semiconductors that had been only
capable of development by TSMC, Intel and Samsung.”</p>
<p>“Despite this breakthrough by SMIC, which almost certainly required
the use of U.S. origin technology and should be an export control
violation, BIS has not acted,” the 66-page report said. “We can no
longer afford to avoid the truth: the unimpeded transfer of U.S.
technology to China is one of the single-largest contributors to China’s
emergence as one of the world’s premier scientific and technological
powers.”</p>
<p>Excessive approvals alleged</p>
<p>Committee Chairman Michael McCaul said BIS had an excessive rate of
approval for controlled technology transfers and lacked checks on
end-use, raising serious questions about the current U.S. export control
mechanism.</p>
<p>“U.S. export control officials should adopt a presumption that all
[Chinese] entities will divert technology to military or surveillance
uses,” said McCaul’s report, but “currently, the overwhelming approval
rates for licenses or exceptions for dual-use technology transfers to
China indicate that licensing officials at BIS are likely presuming that
items will be used only for their intended purposes.”</p>
<p>According to BIS’s website, a key in determining whether an export
license is needed from the Department of Commerce is knowing whether the
item one intends to export has a specific Export Control Classification
Number, or ECCN. All ECCNs are listed in the Commerce Control List, or
CCL, which is divided into ten broad categories.</p>
<p>The committee’s report said that “in 2020, nearly 98% of CCL items
export to China went without a license,” and “in 2021, BIS approved
nearly 90% of applications for the export of CCL items to China.”</p>
<p>The report said that between 2016 and 2021, “the United States
government’s two export control officers in China conducted on average
only 55 end-user checks per year of the roughly 4,000 active licenses in
China. Put another way, BIS likely verified less than 0.01% of all
licenses, which represent less than 1% of all trade with China.”</p>
<p>China skilled in avoiding controls</p>
<p>But China is also skilled at avoiding U.S. export controls, analysts
said.</p>
<p>William Yu, an economist at UCLA Anderson Forecast, told VOA Mandarin
in a phone interview that China can get banned chips through a third
country. “For example, some countries in the Middle East set up a
company in that country to buy these high-level chips from the United
States. From there, one is transferred back to China,” Yu said.</p>
<p>Thomas Duesterberg, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, told VOA
Mandarin in a phone interview that the Commerce Department’s BIS has a
hard job.</p>
<p>“If you forbid technology from going to one company in China, the
Chinese are experts at creating another company or just moving the
company to a new address and disguising its name to try to evade the
controls. China is a big country and there’s a lot of technology that is
at stake here,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s true on the one hand that BIS has been successful in some
areas, such as advanced semiconductors in conjunction with denial of
Chinese ability to buy American technology companies,” said Duesterberg.
“But it’s also true as the [House Foreign Affairs Committee] report
emphasizes that a lot of activities that policymakers would like to
restrict is not being done.”</p>
<p>Insufficient resources or political will?</p>
<p>Despite its huge responsibility to ensure that the United States
stays ahead in the escalating U.S.-China science and technology
competition, the Commerce Department’s BIS is small, employing just over
300 people.</p>
<p>At the annual Reagan National Defense Forum on December 2, Secretary
Raimondo lamented that BIS “has the same budget today as it did a decade
ago” despite the increasing challenges and workload, reported Breaking
Defense, a New York-based online publication on global defense and
politics.</p>
<p>U.S. Representatives Elise Stefanik, Mike Gallagher, who is chairman
of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, and McCaul
released a joint response to Raimondo’s call for additional funds for
the BIS, saying resources alone would not resolve export control
shortcomings.</p>
<p>Raimondo also warned chip companies that the U.S. would further
tighten controls to prevent cutting edge AI technology from going to
Beijing.</p>
<p>“The threat from China is large and growing,” she said in an
interview to CNBC at the December 2 forum. “China wants access to our
most sophisticated semiconductors, and we can’t afford to give them that
access. We’re not just going to deny a single company in China, we’re
going to deny the whole country access to our cutting-edge
semiconductors.”</p>

id="declassified-us-intelligence-reveals-massive-russian-losses-in-ukraine">Declassified
US Intelligence Reveals Massive Russian Losses in Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Newly declassified U.S. intelligence indicates Russia
has suffered from some staggering losses as a result of its nearly
two-year-old invasion of Ukraine, including major setbacks during its
latest offensive.</p>
<p>The assessment, parts of which were shared with VOA, estimates more
than 13,000 Russian forces have been killed or wounded since Moscow
launched its October offensive along the Avdiivka-Novopavlivka axis in
eastern Ukraine.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence also believes Ukraine’s military has destroyed or
immobilized more than 220 Russian combat vehicles, the equivalent of six
battalions’ worth of vehicles.</p>
<p>“Russia’s attempt at an offensive has resulted in no strategic
gains,” National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson told VOA
in a statement, describing the Russian losses as “severe.” </p>
<p>“But Russia is determined to press forward,” she added. “Russia seems
to believe that a military deadlock through the winter will drain
Western support for Ukraine and ultimately give Russia the advantage
despite Russian losses and persistent shortages of trained personnel,
munitions, and equipment.”</p>
<p>The decision to declassify the latest intelligence Tuesday comes as
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in Washington, visiting with
U.S. lawmakers and with U.S. President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>During a speech at the National Defense University in Washington on
Monday, Zelenskyy pleaded with U.S. lawmakers “not to betray” Ukraine’s
forces and provide more weapons and support, warning Moscow sees Ukraine
as “just a stepping-stone.”</p>
<p>“We know what to do,” he said. “You can count on Ukraine, and we hope
just as much to be able to count on you.”</p>
<p>The White House has been pushing U.S. lawmakers to approve more than
$61 billion in supplemental funding for Kyiv before the end of the
year.</p>
<p>But some lawmakers have balked, with some Republicans insisting any
deal to provide more money to Ukraine must also include provisions to
strengthen U.S. immigration policies and security along the U.S.
southern border with Mexico.</p>
<p>White House officials, however, point to the latest declassified
intelligence to argue that funding for Ukraine simply cannot wait.</p>
<p>“This shows how Ukraine is having success stopping Russian forces,
but Putin is continuing to order his troops forward,” a senior
administration official told VOA, speaking on the condition of anonymity
due to the sensitive nature of the intelligence and the political
negotiations.</p>
<p>“It’s critical we continue to support Ukraine and make sure they have
what they need to defend themselves,” the official added.</p>
<p>Top U.S. military and intelligence officials have previously said
Russia’s losses in Ukraine have set its military back by as much as five
to ten years.</p>
<p>Still, the Pentagon warned Monday a failure to back Ukraine will send
Russian President Vladimir Putin the wrong message.</p>
<p>“Despite his isolation, Putin still believes that he can outlast
Ukraine, and that he can outlast America,” Defense Secretary Lloyd
Austin said Monday, speaking with Zelenskyy at the National Defense
University.  “If we do not stand up to the Kremlin’s aggression today,
if we do not deter other would-be aggressors, we will only invite more
aggression, more bloodshed, and more chaos.”</p>

<h2 id="how-the-cop28-negotiations-actually-work">How the COP28
Negotiations Actually Work</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-12, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
This year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP28, has been
broadly defined by two facts. The first is that the conference is headed
by the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/cop28-dubai-sultan-al-jaber-controversy" target="_self">CEO
of the United Arab Emirates’ state-owned oil company</a>. The second is
that this is the year of the first
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop28-global-stocktake-draft" target="_self">global
stocktake</a>, a document that should, in theory, set the world on a
path to achieve the goals laid out in the Paris Agreement of 2015.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps unsurprisingly, that combination has not produced tremendous
results. The latest draft of the stocktake
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/cop28-agreement-fossil-fuel-phaseout" target="_self">dropped</a>
language calling for a fossil fuel phase-out. The condemnation was
swift: “We will not sign our death certificate,” said the Association of
Small Island States in
<a href="https://www.aosis.org/aosis-on-draft-cop-presidency-gst-text-this-cop-cannot-kill-1-5/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
statement</a>. “We think there are elements in the text that are fully
unacceptable,” Spain’s environment minister
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2023/dec/11/cop28-live-time-to-be-ambitious-says-president-as-summit-enters-final-days" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.
</p>
<p>
I was curious: How, exactly, does a global stocktake come to be? To find
out, I called up
<a href="https://www.e3g.org/people/tom-evans/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tom
Evans</a>, a policy advisor and climate negotiations specialist at the
climate change think tank E3G, who is currently on the ground in Dubai.
Our conversation, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity,
is below.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Catch me up. How are things going on the ground?</strong>
</p>
<p>
It’s … going along. There’s a lot of discussions at the moment around
the text that came out yesterday. Many, many parties are dissatisfied
with the level of ambition in that text. It didn’t have the fossil fuel
phaseout, it wasn’t strong enough on things like finance or adaptation,
so that has triggered this big backlash. It’s all happening behind
closed doors at the moment with ministers and politicians talking about
the text, and the rest of us are kind of in a black box with regards to
what’s going on. But it’s all really on a knife’s edge.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What is happening behind those doors, as best as you can
tell?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The process is somewhat unclear. COPs don’t have any strict procedures;
the presidency can choose how to do this diplomacy to get to the outcome
it needs. At the moment, we’re in the phase of basically bilateral
consultations being led by the UAE. The presidency is bringing people
together behind the scenes. Everyone’s kind of slowly talking to each
other.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What do you mean by bilateral consultations, exactly?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The UAE sitting down with a party — let’s say India, for example — and
hearing their concerns and understanding what their red lines are, what
they’re looking to change in the text. And then with that knowledge
they’ll have another meeting, sitting down with, say, the U.S., having
the same conversation and trying to map out where people sit based on
these conversations.
</p>
<p>
They don’t have a big meeting room where everyone is at the table. They
haven’t done a plenary yet. Last night they did a heads of delegation
meeting, which brought all parties together. It was a closed meeting,
and it started at 10 p.m. and finished at about 2 a.m. last night, which
we hadn’t seen before.
</p>
<p>
Of course, at the same time, countries are talking to each other in
different configurations. So there are different groups who will come
together, such as the regional groups [who might have common goals]. And
the U.S., I’m sure, is talking to China and Saudi Arabia.
</p>
<p>
The UAE has other tools at their disposal — earlier this week they
hosted an informal ministerial circle where they talked about the issues
together — but at the moment, they’re choosing to do this very closed or
bilateral diplomacy, probably because the stakes are high and they need
to act sensitively around what this next iteration of text looks like.
Because an awful lot hinges upon it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>There must be some real power dynamics at play here. Are there
some countries that the UAE is more inclined to listen to than
others?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The UNFCCC is weird because some of the times those power dynamics are
different from what you might expect. Small island states and other
countries have an awful lot of power compared to [the regular UN
framework], where they’re not the geopolitical shapers. But in this
space, they have much more power because of their moral authority.
</p>
<p>
<strong>This word, “stocktake,” implies a kind of mathematical act. Is
there an emissions reckoning happening?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Stocktake is definitely a bad name — we’ve already done a lot of the
stock-taking. The past two years had the process of technical dialogues
among parties and experts and non-party stakeholders, and we had
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/the-5-quotes-you-need-to-know-from-the-ipcc-report" target="_self">reports
including the IPCC</a> which fed into that. Those conclusions were
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/annual-emissions-1950-2050-un" target="_self">published</a>
back in September, and that report kind of tells us what we already
know: Action is growing but inadequate, finance is not there at the
scale needed, it’s not going to the right people in the right places at
the right time. We think we know what we need to do, we just have to
find the ways to do it. How do we commit [to] things here in Dubai that
will bend the emissions curve and make sure that actions are implemented
on the ground?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Before this COP, I had the impression that the stocktake is
going to be some sort of big reckoning of past and future emissions. But
it sounds like what’s happening now is similar to how past COP
negotiations have gone. Is there something that makes the stocktake
stand out from the agreements that were negotiated at previous
COPs?</strong>
</p>
<p>
One big difference is that this is the central mechanism of the Paris
Agreement, where we take stock and assess how to close gaps to meeting
those goals. And that hasn’t happened in a formal way before.
</p>
<p>
The Paris Agreement was designed to have a stocktake so that we could
make sure that our successive action, as the years go by, was ratcheting
up, making sure that we’re not just coasting along but really delivering
stronger and stronger progress. So that’s an important part of this. We
are engaging with the Paris Agreement and saying, “okay, can we make
sure it fulfills its goals in that formal way?”
</p>
<p>
The other part of it is that the stocktake, because it’s had this
two-year process, has clearly identified the gaps. No one can deny that
we’re not doing enough on finance and that adaptation is massively
neglected. We’ve acknowledged that there’s been some progress on
emission reductions, but it’s just an incremental push towards what’s
needed. Those conclusions have a certain weight that we can draw from.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What happens if there is no agreement? Is that an option?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I don’t think that is an option. No agreement would be a failure, a
clear sign of an inability of the parties to rise to the challenge of
what’s needed. There’s obviously a difficult question about what level
of agreement is not good enough, but that’s the reason why the parties
are working so hard right now to rescue this — because the deal on the
table at the moment was clearly falling below that line. That’s why we
saw the backlash.
</p>
<p>
The UAE certainly will be aware that that is what’s at stake. It’s their
presidency, they need to deliver what they set out to do. They need to
be able to show the final success. After a year of many pledges and
announcements, new money, new initiatives — all of that is important,
but it doesn’t count unless you negotiate this final outcome.
</p>
<p>
<strong>And every party has to agree to the final outcome?</strong>
</p>
<p>
It has to be <em>consensus</em>, though what exactly consensus means can
be debated. Everyone would have to <em>not</em> object. The weird state
of the UNFCCC process means that sometimes there have been things which
aren’t necessarily fully agreed 100% but still reached consensus.
</p>
<p>
Consensus isn’t perfect. It’s a political call, it’s not a mathematical
number game where you tally up votes. For example, even this year, when
the parties agreed [to] the loss and damage fund, the U.S. said in that
meeting that they didn’t agree to it. But they said they weren’t in the
room when consensus was reached, because the negotiator had left the
room temporarily, so an agreement was reached and they approved it here
in Dubai.
</p>
<p>
So there’s ways you can play with the system and survive. There have
been instances in the past I’ve heard many years ago where decisions
have been gaveled through despite objection because the presidency felt
confident that the objections were not sufficient to obstruct the
outcome.
</p>
<p>
<strong>This is the first stocktake process. Do you think part of what’s
making it so hard is that there is no previous framework?</strong>
</p>
<p>
To an extent we’re creating something new, trying to do this for the
first time. But I think also, it’s the politics. We are looking at the
hardest issue, and for the first time in years getting on the edge of
agreeing [to] something like a fossil fuel phaseout. And that brings up
deep challenges for countries who are extremely dependent on fossil
fuels. That’s true on all sides — not just producers, but also
consumers.
</p>
<p>
We’re talking about initiating a model for the world which doesn’t have
fossils in it. And that’s never been done — even in countries who have
decarbonized to a great degree, they have not been able to show how that
works at an international level.
</p>
<p>
So it is a huge ask, and there is no doubt that there can be challenges
when trying to do that. And that’s what we’re seeing. We’re seeing the
pains of trying to get something that’s useful. We’re no longer
negotiating a treaty like we were in Paris. We’re no longer agreeing on
a rulebook, which we did for five years up until COP26. We’re now really
firmly talking about implementation. What does it mean to deliver the
Paris Agreement? What does it mean to actually reduce emissions, not
just pledge targets? So obviously it’s going to be a painful
conversation, but it’s a difficult and important one.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Is there a misconception or something frustrating about this
process that you wish people knew more about?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I think the biggest frustration is that this isn’t about just a
technical exercise where you’re like, “oh, we need to phase out fossil
fuels, because that’s what is needed.” I mean, that’s true. But there’s
a deeper question here of “how does the Paris Agreement work?”
</p>
<p>
The Paris Agreement works on the basis of a deal that if we have
finance, if we have cooperation, if we have means to deliver action,
[then] we can do more ambitious things, we can raise and accelerate
action. That is what is at stake here. So when we’re talking about
phasing out fossil fuels, we should also be asking, where’s the
financial pathway to do that? When we’re talking about trying to make
sure that countries have more adaptation, where is the money on the
table to do that? And at the moment, we know it’s a drop in the ocean.
These are the contours of the deal that we need to really examine.
</p>
<p>
And it won’t be all sealed here. It goes on and on until COP30 and after
that. But the global stocktake is, I think, like a marriage vow renewal.
You need to kind of renew the trust and the faith that that deal, that
system’s working. And right now it’s looking like maybe a shaky
marriage.

An Epic antitrust loss for Google (12 Dec 2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-12, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links An Epic antitrust loss for Google: They can’t help but
put it in writing. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in
history: 2008, 2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent publications,
upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading
An Epic antitrust loss for Google (permalink) A jury just found Google
guilty on all counts of antitrust violations stemming from its dispute
with Epic, maker of Fortnite, which brought a variety of claims related
to how Google runs its app marketplace. This is huge:
https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/11/technology/epic-games-google-antitrust-ruling.html
The mobile app store world is a duopoly run by Google and Apple. Both
use a variety of tactics to prevent their customers from installing
third party app stores, which funnels all app makers into their own app
stores. Those app stores cream an eye-popping 30% off every purchase
made in an app. This is a shocking amount to charge for payment
processing. The payments sector is incredibly monopolized and notorious
for its price-gouging – and its standard (wildly inflated) rate is 2-5%:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/04/owning-the-libs/#swiper-no-swiping
Now, in theory, Epic doesn’t have to sell in Google Play, the official
Android app store. Unlike Apple’s iOS, Android permit both sideloading
(installing an app directly without using an app store) and configuring
your device to use a different app store. In practice, Google uses a
variety of anticompetitive tricks to prevent these app stores from
springing up and to dissuade Android users from sideloading. Proving
that Google’s actions – like paying Activision $360m as part of “Project
Hug” (no, really!) – were intended to prevent new app storesfrom
springing up was a big lift for Epic. But they managed it, in large part
thanks to Google’s own internal communications, wherein executives
admitted that this was exactly why Project Hug existed. This is part of
a pattern with Big Tech antitrust: many of the charges are theoretically
very hard to make stick, but because the companies put their evil plans
in writing (think of the fraudulent crypto exchange FTX, whose top execs
all conferred in a groupchat called “Wirefraud”), Big Tech keeps losing
in court:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/03/big-tech-cant-stop-telling-on-itself/
Now, I do like to dunk on Big Tech for this kind of thing, because it’s
objectively funny and because the companies make so many unforced
errors. But in an important sense, this kind of written record is
impossible to avoid. Any large institution can only make and enact
policy through administrative systems, and those systems leave behind a
paper-trail: memos, meeting minutes, etc. Yes, we all know that quote
from The Wire: “Is you taking notes on a fucking criminal conspiracy?”
But inevitably, any ambitious conspiracy can only exist if someone is
taking notes. What’s more, any large conspiracy involving lots of
parties will inevitably produce leaks. Think of this as the corollary to
the idea that the moon landing can’t be a hoax, because there’s no way
400,000 co-conspirators could keep the secret. Big Tech’s conspiracies
required hundreds or even thousands of collaborators to keep their
mouths shut, and eventually someone blabs:
https://www.science.org/content/article/fake-moon-landing-you-d-need-400000-conspirators
This is part of a wave of antitrust cases being brought against the tech
giants. As Matt Stoller writes, the guilty-on-all-counts jury verdict
will leak into current and future actions. Remember, Google spent much
of this year in court fighting the DoJ, who argued that the company
bribed Apple not to make a competing search engine, paying tens of
billions every year to keep a competitor from emerging. Now that a jury
has convinced Google of doing that to prevent alternative app stores
from emerging, claims that it used these pay-for-delay tactics in other
sectros get a lot more credible:
https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/boom-google-loses-antitrust-case On
that note: what about Apple? Epic brought a very similar case against
Apple and lost. Both Apple and Epic are appealing that case to the
Supreme Court, and now that Google has been convicted in a similar case,
it might prompt the Supremes to weigh in and resolve the seeming
inconsistencies in the interpretation of federal law. This is a key
moment in the long project to wrest antitrust away from the pro-monopoly
side, who spent decades “training” judges to produce verdicts that run
counter to the plain language of America’s antitrust law:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/13/post-bork-era/#manne-down There’s 40
years’ worth of bad precedent to overturn. The good news is that we’ve
got the law on our side. Literally, the wording of the laws and the
records of the Congressional debate leading to their passage, all
militate towards the (incredibly obvious) conclusion that the purpose of
anti-monopoly law is to fight monopoly, not defend it:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/14/aiming-at-dollars/#not-men It’s
amazing to realize that we got into this monopoly quagmire because
judges just literally refused to enforce the law. That’s what makes one
part of the jury verdict against Google so exciting: the jury found that
Google’s insistence that Play Store sellers use its payment processor
was an act of illegal tying. Today, “tying” is an obscure legal theory,
but few doctrines would be more useful in disenshittifying the internet.
A company is guilty of illegal tying when it forces you to use unrelated
products or services as a condition of using the product you actually
want. The abandonment of tying led to a host of horribles, from printer
companies forcing you to buy ink at $10,000/gallon to Livenation forcing
venues to sell tickets through its Ticketmaster subsidiary. The next
phase of this comes when the judge decides on the penalty. Epic doesn’t
want cash damages – it wants the judge to order Google to fulfill its
promise of “an open, competitive Android ecosystem for all users and
industry participants.” They’ve asked the judge to order Google to
facilitate third-party app stores, and to separate app stores from
payment processors. As Stoller puts it, they want to “crush Google’s
control over Android”:
https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-v-google-trial-verdict-a-win-for-all-developers
Google has sworn to appeal, surprising no one. The Times’s expert says
that they will have a tough time winning, given how clear the verdict
was. Whatever this means for Google and Android, it means a lot for a
future free from monopolies. Hey look at this (permalink) An Influencer

TikTok influencers</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-12, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Television journalists have long been encouraged to have a social
media presence to build their brands and provide additional outlets for
network content. Journalists have always been influencers for their
stations — but in 2024, we’ll see them start to be additionally
compensated for this labor, and financially benefit from their own
social media presence….</p>

Still Love Tesla, Whatever Elon Musk Does</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-12, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDc0Mzg2OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxNzA0Mjk3OX0.tYt2tFlTkhdxjctXpMU6SDCB2H5PWBT3Scj_ZNoQ5Gw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
In the weeks leading up to Elon Musk’s latest round of controversies,
27% percent of Americans who reported wanting to buy an EV in the future
said that the billionaire’s behavior made them less likely to pick a
Tesla, down from 36% who said the same in February. On the other hand,
35% of prospective EV buyers said that Musk had made them <em>more</em>
likely to purchase a Tesla — a reversal of the results from the last
time <em>Heatmap</em>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/elon-musk-is-alienating-future-tesla-buyers-heatmap-poll-finds" target="_self">took
Americans’ temperature</a> on the controversial CEO, when more people
were put off by Musk’s behavior than swayed by him.

</center>
<p>
<em>Heatmap</em>’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/change-polling-concern-belief-republicans-vs-democrats" target="_self">new
poll</a> — which was conducted by Benenson Strategy Group between Nov. 6
and Nov. 13, 2023 — notably did not account for Musk’s latest scandal:
reinstating <em>Infowars</em> founder and
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/22/us/politics/heres-what-jones-has-said-about-sandy-hook.html" target="_blank">Newtown
massacre denialist</a> Alex Jones to the website formerly known as
Twitter. The poll was also
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/technology/elon-musk-endorses-antisemitic-post-ibm.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">conducted
days before</a> Musk endorsed an anti-semitic post on X, leading to an
advertiser exodus from the platform.
</p>
<p>
Still, since the last <em>Heatmap</em> poll in February, Americans have
had plenty of time to see other negative headlines about Musk, including
around his volatile
<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/10/elon-musk-twitter-x-one-year-everything-he-ruined.html" target="_blank">ownership
of X</a>, his
“<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/7/23863157/elon-musk-ukraine-twitter-starlink-isaacson" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">outsize
role in geopolitics, thanks to SpaceX</a>,” his mockery of Ukrainian
President
<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/billionaire-elon-musk-mocks-ukraine-president-zelenskyy-asking-aid-with-meme/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Volodymyr
Zelensky</a>, and his public attacks on
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/twitter-musk-iceland-fired-wheelchair-haraldur-employee-0329405846dac8f1f08ac55594881bb6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a

<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2023/05/16/george-soros-elon-musk-adl/" target="_blank">George
Soros</a>, and
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-09-05/elon-musk-blames-jews-threatens-adl" target="_blank">the
Anti-Defamation League</a>.
</p>
<p>
Even so, Tesla outsold its next 19 rival EV automakers combined, and by
a wide margin, in the first six months of 2023,
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-rivals-scrap-thin-slices-us-ev-sales-2023-09-27/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Reuters</em>
reports</a>. And despite declining earnings, its shares have risen 94%
so far this year, far outpacing the S&amp;P 500. When trying to account
for this resilience in the face of Musk’s parade of recent scandals,
<em>Platformer</em>’s Casey Newton
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/08/podcasts/hardfork-google-gemini-cybertruck.html?showTranscript=1" target="_blank">mused</a>
last week on <em>The New York Times</em>’ <em>Hard Fork</em> podcast
that there might still be “a contingent of folks who want to believe
that the Elon Musk of 2023 is the Elon Musk of 2013, and that he said a
couple of kooky things here and there, but at his core, he’s billionaire
genius, Tony Stark, savior of humanity.” But at the same time, he went
on, this might be a “moment in the sun for Tesla” and “maybe a few years
from now, we look back and we think, oh yeah, that’s when the wheels
started to come off the wagon.”
</p>
<p>
Overall, <em>Heatmap</em> found that some 39% of Democrats and
left-leaning Independents said Musk has made them less likely to look at
a Tesla, a small drop from 44% who said the same in February. Only 17%
of Republicans and right-leaning Independents said the same. Of all
respondents surveyed, though, a plurality (46%) said Musk ultimately has
“no impact” on their decision to buy or lease a Tesla, proving there
apparently are some people lucky enough to
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/14/23600358/elon-musk-tweets-algorithm-changes-twitter" target="_blank">not
have to think about this guy</a>.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, 35% of men but only 15% of women said that Musk has made
them more likely to buy a Tesla. Make of that what you will!

Now, de Vries’
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crsus.2023.100004"><i>Bitcoin’s
growing water footprint</i></a> reveals that supporting
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/05/the-cryptocurrency-use-case.html">gambling,
money laundering and crime</a> causes yet another massive waste of
resources.<br /> <br /> But that’s not all. de Vries has joined a
growing chorus of researchers showing that the VC’s <i>pivot to AI</i>
wastes similar massive amounts of power. Can analysis of AI’s e-waste
and water consumption be far behind?<br /> <br /> Below the fold I
discuss papers by de Vries and others on this issue.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> First, de Vries examines the
problem highlighted by Jacky Sawicky of the
<a href="https://amycastor.com/2023/10/23/texans-versus-bitcoin-jackie-sawicky-and-the-texas-coalition-against-cryptomining/">Texas
Coalition Against Cryptomining</a>, water usage by Riot Blockchain’s
massive Texas mining operation:<br />
<blockquote>
Corsicana will sell Riot the water. Jackie only discovered how much
water Riot needed via records requests. “They asked for 1.6 million
gallons a day in the height of the summer, and we are all being told to
conserve,” Jackie said.<br /> <br /> “When Riot tells people they are
going to be wasting 1.6 million gallons a day, more than the iron smelt,
more than the candy factory, they are going to be the number one user of
water,” said Jackie.
</blockquote>
In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crsus.2023.100004"><i>Bitcoin’s
growing water footprint</i></a> Alex de Vries discovers some very large
water losses:<br />
<blockquote>
Amid growing concerns over the impacts of climate change on worldwide
water security, Bitcoin’s water footprint has rapidly escalated in
recent years. The water footprint of Bitcoin in 2021 significantly
increased by 166% compared with 2020, from 591.2 to 1,573.7 GL. The
water footprint per transaction processed on the Bitcoin blockchain for
those years amounted to 5,231 and 16,279 L, respectively. As of 2023,
Bitcoin’s annual water footprint may equal 2,237 GL.
</blockquote>
That is, each Bitcoin transaction consumes a
<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/technology/a-single-bitcoin-transaction-uses-enough-water-to-fill-a-swimming-pool/ar-AA1kJBzC">small
swimming pool worth</a> of water.<br /> <br /> de Vries
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crsus.2023.100004">computes two kinds
of losses</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The first involves onsite (direct) water use for cooling systems and air
humidification. Water usage depends on cooling system types and local
climate conditions. It is important to differentiate between water
withdrawal and water consumption in terms of this usage. Water
withdrawal pertains to the water taken from surface water or groundwater
sources, while water consumption refers to the portion of water that
becomes unavailable for reuse after withdrawal, primarily due to
evaporation in cooling systems. Water consumption is not extensively
studied in Bitcoin mining or generic data center research, as reliable
data on water consumption factors are challenging to obtain.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crsus.2023.100004">And</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The second way in which miners use water relates to the (indirect) water
consumption associated with generating the electricity necessary to
power their devices. Thermoelectric power generation plays a major role
in water consumption, as a portion of the withdrawn water for cooling
purposes evaporates (unless dry cooling technologies utilizing air are
employed).
</blockquote>
Note some
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crsus.2023.100004">caveats</a> (my
emphasis):<br />
<blockquote>
These systems can utilize both freshwater and non-freshwater sources.
This commentary, however, exclusively focuses on freshwater
<i>consumption</i>. … The total water footprint of Bitcoin examined in
this commentary encompasses the freshwater <i>consumed</i> due to both
direct and indirect water <i>consumption</i> during the operational
stage of Bitcoin mining devices.
</blockquote>
It is important to note that water consumed is not the only concern,
withdrawn water can be too.
<a href="https://amycastor.com/2023/10/23/texans-versus-bitcoin-jackie-sawicky-and-the-texas-coalition-against-cryptomining/">Sawicky
points out that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The water gets quite hot — over 100 degrees Fahrenheit — and that hot
water needs to go somewhere. Where will it go?<br /> <br /> Jackie
hasn’t been able to get a clear answer, but she has concerns. “The
property Riot purchased here in Navarro Country feeds into Richland
Creek and Richland Creek feeds into Richland-Chambers Reservoir, and
that’s the tap water for Arlington-Fort Worth.”
</blockquote>
Hot water kills fish, and any pollution from the Riot facility will end
up in the water supply.<br /> <br />

The US hosts a significant part of the total Bitcoin mining fleet. The
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/09/business/bitcoin-mining-electricity-pollution.html"><i>New
York Times</i> list</a> of
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crsus.2023.100004">large US
miners</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
includes 34 Bitcoin mines, with the power requirement for each mine
ranging from 38 to 450 megawatts (MW) as of March 2023. Together, these
34 mines are responsible for 3.91 GW of power demand, representing
roughly a quarter of Bitcoin’s total estimated power demand in the same
month (i.e., 16.2 GW) and a majority of the share that can be attributed
to the US according to the CCAF (i.e., 37.84% as of January 2022).
</blockquote>
de Vries <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crsus.2023.100004">estimates
that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This means the total water footprint of US Bitcoin miners, after adding
their direct water consumption, could be an annual 93–120 GL, which is
10%–41% more than the estimated indirect water consumption of 84.9 GL
per year. It also means the total water footprint of US Bitcoin miners
could be equivalent to the average annual water consumption of around
300,000 US households, comparable with a city such as Washington, DC.

Thus only about <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w29396">10% are
“economically meaningful”</a> transactions between individuals and
exchanges (about 2080/hour), so the average <i>economically
meaningful</i> transaction consumes 4MWh. It generates
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/02/ee380-talk.html">an average of a
quarter of a MacBook Air</a> of e-waste, and uses 160K liters of
water.<br /> <br /> For comparison, our house uses 4.3MWh/year,
generates perhaps 2 MacBook Airs of e-waste per year, and consumes 223K
liters of water per year. So each economically meaningful Bitcoin
transaction consumes almost our annual electricity usage, about 6 weeks
of our e-waste generation, and about 70% of our annual water
usage.<br /> <br /> de Vries then follows the current hype cycle and
pivots to AI. In
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2023.09.004"><i>The growing
energy footprint of artificial intelligence</i></a> he starts with the
notoriously compute-intensive training phase:<br />
<blockquote>
Hugging Face reported that its BigScience Large Open-Science Open-Access
Multilingual (BLOOM) model consumed 433 MWh of electricity during
training.4 Other LLMs, including GPT-3, Gopher and Open Pre-trained
Transformer (OPT), reportedly used 1,287, 1,066, and 324 MWh,
respectively, for training. Each of these LLMs, was trained on terabytes
of data and has 175 billion or more parameters.
</blockquote>
de Vries then turns to the less-studied
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2023.09.004">inference
phase</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Research firm SemiAnalysis suggested that OpenAI required 3,617 of
NVIDIA’s HGX A100 servers, with a total of 28,936 graphics processing
units (GPUs), to support ChatGPT, implying an energy demand of 564 MWh
per day. Compared to the estimated 1,287 MWh used in GPT-3’s training
phase, the inference phase’s energy demand appears considerably higher.
Furthermore, Google reported that 60% of AI-related energy consumption
from 2019 to 2021 stemmed from inference.
</blockquote>
He estimates for Google the
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2023.09.004">energy needed per
inference in LLMs</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
SemiAnalysis estimated that implementing AI similar to ChatGPT in each
Google search would require 512,821 of NVIDIA’s A100 HGX servers,
totaling 4,102,568 GPUs. At a power demand of 6.5 kW per server, this
would translate into a daily electricity consumption of 80 GWh and an
annual consumption of 29.2 TWh. New Street Research independently
arrived at similar estimates, suggesting that Google would need
approximately 400,000 servers, which would lead to a daily consumption
of 62.4 GWh and an annual consumption of 22.8 TWh. With Google currently
processing up to 9 billion searches daily, these scenarios would average
to an energy consumption of 6.9–8.9 Wh per request. This estimate aligns
with Hugging Face’s BLOOM model, which consumed 914 kWh of electricity
for 230,768 requests,4 averaging to 3.96 Wh per request.<br /> …<br />
Alphabet’s chairman indicated in February 2023 that interacting with an
LLM could ’’likely cost 10 times more than a standard keyword search.6”
As a standard Google search reportedly uses 0.3 Wh of electricity,9 this
suggests an electricity consumption of approximately 3 Wh per LLM
interaction.
</blockquote>
And similarly for
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2023.09.004">ChatGPT</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
SemiAnalysis’ assessment of ChatGPT’s operating costs in early 2023,
which estimated that ChatGPT responds to 195 million requests per day,
requiring an estimated average electricity consumption of 564 MWh per
day, or, at most, 2.9 Wh per request.

de Vries considers a worst-case scenario in which <i>every</i> search
involved interacting with an LLM:<br />
<blockquote>
In 2021, Google’s total electricity consumption was 18.3 TWh, with AI
accounting for 10%–15% of this total. The worst-case scenario suggests
Google’s AI alone could consume as much electricity as a country such as
Ireland (29.3 TWh per year),
</blockquote>
Fortunately, the hardware supply chain can’t deliver the chips needed to
do this, and even if it could Google would not want to make the roughly
$100B investment. A more realistic scenario is based on Nvidia’s
projected sales of 100,000 AI servers in 2023:<br />
<blockquote>
these servers would have a combined power demand of 650–1,020 MW. On an
annual basis, these servers could consume up to 5.7–8.9 TWh of
electricity. Compared to the historical estimated annual electricity
consumption of data centers, which was 205 TWh, this is almost
negligible.
</blockquote>
Note that this estimate assumes 100% duty cycle but ignores the power
needed to cool the servers, two effects which tend to cancel each other.
It also ignores the embedded energy in the servers, and their eventual
contribution to the e-waste problem. de Vries concludes:<br />
<blockquote>
While the exact future of AI-related electricity consumption remains
difficult to predict, the scenarios discussed in this commentary
underscore the importance of tempering both overly optimistic and overly
pessimistic expectations. Integrating AI into applications such as
Google Search can significantly boost the electricity consumption of
these applications. However, various resource factors are likely to
restrain the growth of global AIrelated electricity consumption in the
near term. Simultaneously, it is probably too optimistic to expect that
improvements in hardware and software efficiencies will fully offset any
longterm changes in AI-related electricity consumption. These
advancements can trigger a rebound effect whereby increasing efficiency
leads to increased demand for AI, escalating rather than reducing total
resource use.

de Vries’ pivot to the cost of AI inference is joined by Alexandra Sasha
Luccioni, Yacine Jernite and Emma Strubell with
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16863.pdf"><i>Power Hungry
Processing: Watts Driving the Cost of AI Deployment?</i></a> who:<br />
<blockquote>
propose the first systematic comparison of the ongoing inference cost of
various categories of ML systems, covering both task-specific
(i.e. finetuned models that carry out a single task) and
‘general-purpose’ models, (i.e. those trained for multiple tasks). We
measure deployment cost as the amount of energy and carbon required to
perform 1,000 inferences on representative benchmark dataset using these
models. We find that multi-purpose, generative architectures are orders
of magnitude more expensive than task-specific systems for a variety of
tasks, even when controlling for the number of model parameters.
</blockquote>
As with de Vries, they justify their
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16863.pdf">focus on
inference</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
According to AWS, the largest global cloud provider, inference is
estimated to make up 80 to 90% of total ML cloud computing demand [2,
28], whereas a 2021 publication by Meta attributed approximately
one-third of their internal end-to-end ML carbon footprint to model
inference, with the remainder produced by data management, storage, and
training [56]; similarly, a 2022 study from Google attributed 60% of its
ML energy use to inference, compared to 40% for training [40].
</blockquote>
Luccioni <i>et al</i>’s Figure 1 (note Y axis logarithmic) shows that
the range of carbon emissions for the various tasks they tested spans 3
orders of magnitude. Generative tasks are by far more expensive, with
image generation particularly costly.<br /> <br />

They report that although increasing model size increases emissions, the
effect is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16863.pdf">less than that
of the task</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
We do observe a relationship between model size and quantity of
emissions produced during inference, with differing progressions for
each modality – however, the task structure accounts for more of the
variation than the model size does. We can observe once again that
text-to-image is by far the most carbon- and energy-intensive task, with
smaller image generation models such as <tt>segmind/tiny-sd</tt> that
have around 500M parameters producing magnitudes more carbon than
text-to-category models (100g vs. 0.6 g of CO 2 per 1,000
inferences).<br /> …<br /> For context, the most carbon-intensive image
generation model <tt>(stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0)</tt> generates 1,594
grams of CO 2 for 1,000 inferences, which is roughly the equivalent to
4.1 miles driven by an average gasoline-powered passenger vehicle.
</blockquote>
They <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16863.pdf">conclude</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<i>Using multi-purpose models for discriminative tasks is more
energy-intensive compared to task-specific models for these same
tasks.</i> This is especially the case for text classification (on IMDB,
SST 2 and Rotten Tomatoes) and question answering (on SciQ, SQuAD v1 and
v2), where the gap between task-specific and zero-shot models is
particularly large, and less so for summarization (for CNN-Daily Mail,
SamSUM and XSum). As can be seen in Table 4, the difference between
multi-purpose models and task-specific models is amplified as the length
of output gets longer.<br /> …<br /> While we see the benefit of
deploying generative zero-shot models given their ability to carry out
multiple tasks, we do not see convincing evidence for the necessity of
their deployment in contexts where tasks are well-defined, for instance
web search and navigation, given these models’ energy requirements.
</blockquote>
One of the most-hyped applications of AI is
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/11/robotaxi-economics.html">autonomous
vehicles</a>, and Soumya Sudhakar, Vivienne Sze and Sertac Karaman
examine their externalities in
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/MM.2022.3219803"><i>Data Centers on
Wheels: Emissions From Computing Onboard Autonomous Vehicles</i></a>
which is summarized by Brandon Vigliarolo in
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/13/selfdriving_car_computers_could_equal/"><i>Self-driving
car computers may be ‘as bad’ for emissions as datacenters</i></a>.
Sudhakar <i>et al</i> use probabilistic models to estimate the power
needed for autonomous navigation:<br />
<blockquote>
Based on current trends, a widespread AV adoption scenario where
approximately 95% of all vehicles are autonomous requires computer power
to be less than 1.2 kW for emissions from computing on AVs to be less
than emissions from all data centers in 2018 in 90% of modeled
scenarios. Anticipating a future scenario with high adoption of AVs,
business-as-usual decarbonization, and workloads doubling every three
years, hardware efficiency must double every 1.1 years for emissions in
2050 to equal 2018 data center emissions. The rate of increase in
hardware efficiency needed in many scenarios to contain emissions is
faster than the current rate.
</blockquote>
Again, note that in aggregate autonomous vehicles will consume far more
power in inference than in training.<br /> <br />

History shows that the efficiency of the on-board computers in
autonomous vehicles has doubled every 2.8 years. Their models, using
plausible assumptions as to parameters such as the adoption rate of the
technology, and the growth of the navigation workload, show that unless
the hardware efficiency increases much faster emissions from autonomous
vehicles will rapidly eclipse the total from all data centers in 2018.
For example, their Figure 1 shows:<br />
<blockquote>
Emissions from computing onboard AVs driving 1 h/day. With one billion
AVs, an average computer power of 0.84 kW yields emissions equal to
emissions of all data centers.

<p>In all these cases we see the industry’s total lack of concern for
externalities such as carbon emissions, grid stability, e-waste and
water consumption. In cryptocurrency’s case we can add

President Remains Leader of Ivy League School Following Backlash on
Antisemitism Testimony</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Harvard President Claudine Gay will remain leader
of the prestigious Ivy League school following her comments last week at
a congressional hearing on antisemitism, the university’s highest
governing body announced Tuesday. </p>
<p>“Our extensive deliberations affirm our confidence that President Gay
is the right leader to help our community heal and to address the very
serious societal issues we are facing,” the Harvard Corporation said in
a statement following its meeting Monday night. </p>
<p>Only months into her leadership, Gay came under intense scrutiny
following the hearing in which she and two of her peers struggled to
answer questions about campus antisemitism. Their academic responses
provoked a backlash from Republican opponents, along with alumni and
donors who say the university leaders are failing to stand up for Jewish
students on their campuses. </p>
<p>Some lawmakers and donors to the university called for Gay to step
down, following the resignation of Liz Magill as president of the
University of Pennsylvania on Saturday. </p>
<p>The Harvard Crimson student newspaper first reported Tuesday that
Gay, who became Harvard’s first Black president in July, will remain in
office with the support of the Harvard Corporation following the
conclusion of the board’s meeting. It cited an unnamed source familiar
with the decision. </p>
<p>A petition signed by more than 600 faculty members asked the school’s
governing body to keep Gay in charge. </p>
<p>“So many people have suffered tremendous damage and pain because of
Hamas’s brutal terrorist attack, and the university’s initial statement
should have been an immediate, direct, and unequivocal condemnation,”
the corporation’s statement said. “Calls for genocide are despicable and
contrary to fundamental human values. President Gay has apologized for
how she handled her congressional testimony and has committed to
redoubling the university’s fight against antisemitism.” </p>
<p>In an interview with The Crimson last week, Gay said she got caught
up in a heated exchange at the House committee hearing and failed to
properly denounce threats of violence against Jewish students. </p>
<p>“What I should have had the presence of mind to do in that moment was
return to my guiding truth, which is that calls for violence against our
Jewish community — threats to our Jewish students — have no place at
Harvard, and will never go unchallenged,” Gay said. </p>
<p>Testimony from Gay and Magill drew intense national backlash, as have
similar responses from the president of MIT, who also testified before
the Republican-led House Education and Workforce Committee. </p>
<p>The corporation also addressed allegations of plagiarism against Gay,
saying that Harvard became aware of them in late October regarding three
articles she had written. It initiated an independent review at Gay’s
request. </p>
<p>The corporation reviewed the results on Saturday, “which revealed a
few instances of inadequate citation” and found no violation of
Harvard’s standards for research misconduct, it said.</p>

<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Forget
spaceships; I just want my music</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago, as my kids settled into the car, I asked like I always do, &quot;what songs do you want me to play?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
They have a range of favored earworms, from Baby Shark to Babaloo, and
usually the songs are tolerable, at least.
</p>
<p>
But a few albums, like Bluey’s soundtrack, transcend the children’s
genre. They’re genuinely fun to listen to, for everyone in the car.
</p>
<p>
Well, that fine day, the kids chose Ladybug Music. And let me tell you,
besides a few duds, Ladybug Music <em>slaps</em>. And the songs
incorporate diverse styles, too, it’s not just the same nursery rhymes
regurgitated in a bubbly voice.
</p>
<p>
So I found the album on my phone and noticed the songs were all greyed
out.
</p>
<p>
I tapped one, and <em>nothing</em>. Just this notice:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/song-not-available.jpg" width="700" height="auto" class="insert-image" alt="Song not available Apple Music on iPhone" />
</p>
<p>
Not available in my region? Well, that’s weird. I pay for Apple Music.
And I know the artist is in the US, and <em>I’m</em> in the US…

Negotiators at the COP28 climate summit remain divided over the text
that will appear in the final deal to emerge from the conference, and in
particular whether the text will call on countries to phase out fossil
fuels. The conference was scheduled to end this morning but is running
into overtime. Yesterday an updated draft text was swiftly and widely
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/cop28-agreement-fossil-fuel-phaseout" target="_blank">condemned</a>
in part because it eliminated the “phase out” language in an attempt to
appease Saudi Arabia, among other nations. This morning COP28 Director
General Majid Al Suwaidi said that draft was just a starting point for
talks. He added that the United Arab Emirates COP presidency
<a href="wants%20the%20text%20to%20include%20fossil%20fuels" target="_blank">wants
the text to include fossil fuels</a> but that in the end, it will be up
to the nations in attendance to come to an agreement. A new draft of the
text is expected sometime today.

change and pollution pose some of the biggest threats to freshwater

a part. The assessment found that the global population of Atlantic

ecosystems are well managed, remain free-flowing with sufficient water,

At Wednesday’s board of trustees’ meeting, the leadership at College of
the Canyons will have an opportunity to join over 100 other United
States colleges and universities by signing the statement, “We Stand
Together with Israel Against Hamas.” The statement itself is direct,
simple and elegant. It clearly identifies Israel as the victim of
violence […]

id="heart-of-hawaiis-historic-lahaina-burned-in-wildfire-reopens-to-residents-business-owners">Heart
of Hawaii’s Historic Lahaina, Burned in Wildfire, Reopens to Residents,
Business Owners</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LAHAINA — The heart of Lahaina, the historic town on the Hawaiian
island of Maui that burned in a deadly wildfire that killed at least 100
people, reopened Monday to residents and business owners holding day
passes.</p>
<p>The renewed access marks an important emotional milestone for victims
of the Aug. 8 fire, but much work remains to be done to safely clear
properties of burned debris and rebuild.</p>
<p>The reopened areas include Banyan Tree Park, home to a 150-year-old
tree that burned in the fire but that is now sprouting new leaves,
Lahaina’s public library, an elementary school and popular
restaurants.</p>
<p>An oceanfront section of Front Street, where the fire ripped through
a traffic jam of cars trying to escape town, reopened Friday.</p>
<p>Authorities are continuing to recommend that people entering scorched
lots wear protective gear to shield them from hazards.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the state Department of Health released test results
confirming the ash and dust left by the fire is toxic and that arsenic
is the biggest concern. Arsenic is a heavy metal that adheres to
wildfire dust and ash, the department said.</p>
<p>The tests examined ash samples collected Nov. 7-8 from 100 properties
built from the 1900s to the 2000s. Samples also showed high levels of
lead, which was used to paint houses built before 1978.</p>
<p>The clean up is still in its early stages. For the past few months,
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has been removing batteries,
propane tanks, pesticides and other hazards from the town’s more than
2,000 destroyed buildings.</p>
<p>Residents and business owners have been able to visit their
properties after the EPA has finished clearing their lots. In some
cases, residents — often wearing white full-body suits, masks and gloves
— have found family heirlooms and mementos after sifting through the
charred rubble of their homes.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will begin hauling away the
remaining debris and take it to a landfill after it gets permission from
property owners.</p>
<p>The EPA and the state’s health department have installed 53 air
monitors in Lahaina and Upcountry Maui, where a separate fire burned
homes in early August. The department is urging people to avoid outdoor
activity when monitor levels show elevated air pollution and to close
windows and doors.</p>

<em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The UN climate change talks in
Dubai are reaching their final phase, but because the nations can’t
agree on a draft deal to phase out fossil fuels, the conference has gone
into overtime. Some countries unhappy with the draft language are small
island nations like Tuvalu. We take a closer look. Plus, Poland’s

And, with this week&amp;#8217;s recipe, Butter-Toasted Oat Pancakes, you can also add toasty and nutty to the list.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>As is sometimes the case in American politics, a bill that many
people are likely not paying a great deal of attention to is likely to
have enormous impact on the nation’s future. That $110.5 billion
national security supplemental package was designed to provide
additional funding for Ukraine in its war to fight off Russia’s
invasion; security assistance to Israel, primarily for missile defense
systems; humanitarian assistance to citizens in Gaza and the West Bank,
Ukraine, and elsewhere; funding to replenish U.S. weapon stockpiles;
assistance to regional partners in the Indo-Pacific; investments in
efforts to stop illegal fentanyl from coming into the U.S. and to
dismantle international drug cartels; and investment in U.S. Customs and

<h2 id="cop-cant-go-on-like-this">COP Can’t Go On Like This</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-12, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDcyODcxMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MTE1MzEyOX0.nwchmLDTGUPLLZNRj_T9g1CZnS2-afx-kGpj_Y6BMDY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
It didn’t attract a lot of attention, but for a few months, it looked
like the United Nations climate process might break down.
</p>
<p>
There, process is substance: One of the most important acts every year
is the selection of the <em>next </em>country to run the Conference of
the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change, or COP. This distinction
<a href="https://unfccc.int/process/bodies/supreme-bodies/conference-of-the-parties-cop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">normally
rotates</a> among the UN’s five regional country groups; next year, a
country in the “Eastern Europe” group is due to host. All the members of
a group must unanimously agree on which country will get to host.
</p>
<p>
This is a highly contingent way to decide who gets to host a climate
conference. Really,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Regional_Groups" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
entire schema of UN regional groups</a> represents a hangover of Cold
War geopolitics that is now indefinitely unchangeable. (The “Western
Europe” group is essentially the early members of NATO; it includes such
notably non-western-European countries as Turkey, the United States, and
— hilariously — Australia.)
</p>
<p>
The “Eastern Europe” group, meanwhile, amounts to more or less the
former members of the Warsaw Pact. For obvious reasons, these countries
cannot agree on a consensus choice in 2023. Russia, the group’s largest
member, was not amenable to holding the COP in any eastern Europe NATO
member state, such as Poland, Latvia, or Finland. The eastern European
NATO members — as well as Ukraine, which is also in the UN regional
group — were similarly opposed to holding the COP in Russia.
</p>
<p>
That meant that attention focused on the group’s countries in the
Caucasus, at the edge of central Asia: Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia.
Yet difficulties presented themselves here too. Azerbaijan
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/27/world/europe/nagorno-karabakh-armenia-azerbaijan.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">successfully
seized an Armenian exclave</a> earlier this year,
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/armenia-calls-un-mission-monitor-rights-nagorno-karabakh-2023-09-24/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">evicting
up to 120,000 Armenians</a> as part of a campaign
<a href="https://www.cfr.org/article/ethnic-cleansing-happening-nagorno-karabakh-how-can-world-respond#:~:text=The%20ethnic%20Armenian%20population%20of,have%20fled%20west%20to%20Armenia." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">described
as ethnic cleansing</a>. Armenia blocked any Azeri bid to host the COP.
</p>
<p>
For the first time in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change’s
history, no country would have been able to lead COP the following year.
Geopolitics had seemingly broken the consensus mechanism that makes the
climate conference work.
</p>
<p>
This amounted to more than just a deficiency in party planning. It would
have forced Bonn, Germany — the home of the UNFCC’s permanent
headquarters — to host COP29, a kind of “break in case of emergency”
default option. And it would have allowed the United Arab Emirates, a
petrostate that has reportedly
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67508331" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">used
the COP to make oil deals</a>, to retain the conference presidency for
at least another year.
</p>
<p>
That didn’t happen. Late last week, Armenia lifted its block of
Azerbaijan’s bid, and the two countries
<a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/azerbaijan-aremenia-good-will-steps-karabakh/32721137.html#:~:text=RL's%20Armenian%20Service-,Azerbaijan%2C%20Armenia%20Agree%20To%20Several%20Goodwill%20Steps,Including%20Mutual%20Release%20Of%20Prisoners&text=Azerbaijan%20released%2032%20Armenian%20servicemen,tangible%20steps%22%20toward%20building%20trust." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mutually
released prisoners</a> in a gesture of good will. (Their rapprochement
happened suspiciously close to President Vladimir Putin’s visit to the
U.A.E.) Next year’s COP will seemingly happen in Baku, the Azeri
capital.
</p>
<p>
But just because the COP process didn’t break doesn’t mean that it’s not
being stretched. All is not well with the COP. During this year’s
conference, a picture emerged of a COP being tested by a more rivalrous,
conflict-prone world. Geopolitics, the heightened importance of climate
change, and the sheer size of the conference have transformed the event
into something that it was never meant to be.
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
This year, more than 100,000 people attended the COP. It was held at
Dubai’s opulent Expo City, the Disney World-style convention campus
<a href="https://www.bie-paris.org/site/en/all-world-expos" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">initially
built for the 2020 World Expo</a>, the modern successor to World’s
Fairs. Hundreds of nonprofit groups and companies, as well as more than
190 countries, ran public pavilions that advertised their climate
accomplishments and views on decarbonization. Negotiators divided into
different blocs: China and the United States, oil-producing states and
small island nations, the West and the rest.
</p>
<p>
It wasn’t always like this. When the first COP was held in Berlin in
1995, the world was in a very different era, Lee Beck, the senior
director for Europe and the Middle East at the Clean Air Task Force,
told me. It was “the peak of multilateralism, followed by relative
geopolitical stability and peace,” she said. The United States and the
broader West set the agenda for global events.
</p>
<p>
“In the last two years — others would say the writing was on the wall as
early as 2014 — geopolitical fragmentation really is visible,” she said.
“You’re really pushing the limits of multilateralism at this one. One of
the cracks is we’re unable to agree where the COP even will be.”
</p>
<p>
But geopolitics are not the only force stretching COP to the limit.
Another is the sheer size of the event itself.
</p>
<p>
There used to be “big COPs” and “small COPs”: COP21, the 2015 meeting
where the Paris Agreement was finalized, was a “big COP,” but the
following year’s conference in Marrakech, Morocco, was a fairly minor
one. Even COP21 was less than half the size of this year’s COP. And in
one possible read, this year <em>should</em> have been a smaller COP —
the biggest to-dos were
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/cop28-loss-damage-reparations-fund" target="_self">formally
launching the Loss and Damage fund</a> and writing
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop28-global-stocktake-draft" target="_self">the
Global Stocktake report</a>, a kind of report card on the world’s
climate progress (or lack thereof).
</p>
<p>
But small COPs don’t seem to happen any more. Since the pandemic ended
and COP26
<a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/cop26" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">took
place in Glasgow, Scotland</a>, COPs have swollen in size, creating the
age of the new “mega-COP.” More than 100,000 people attended the
conference this year, making it by far the biggest COP ever. It was more
than twice the size of last year’s confab in Sharm al-Sheikh, Egypt,
which was previously the biggest COP ever. Most of those attendees
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/11/climate/cop28-dubai.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had
nothing to do</a> with the negotiations ostensibly at the center of the
conference — they were investors, technologists, scholars, scientists,
or experts — and instead made up a de facto global trade show on climate
solutions.
</p>
<p>
COP is now so big and climate is now so important that even the lack of
news about the conference can generate news. When President Joe Biden
declined to attend this year’s conference, <em>The New York Times
</em>push-alerted it.
</p>
<p>
But there are possibilities that could improve the situation. One of
them might be that COP simply becomes so unmanageable that it has to
scale back. Few cities have the spare capacity to house an extra 100,000
visitors for 12 days. New York City, for instance, only has
<a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2021/01/15/what-happens-to-all-of-nyc-s-empty-hotels-" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about
123,000 hotel rooms</a> total. If COP were to keep growing, the problem
would only get harder. When 150,000
people<a href="https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Dreamforce-hits-downtown-S-F-with-150-000-people-6504242.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
descended on San Francisco</a> for Salesforce’s annual conference in
2015, the company docked a cruise ship in the bay to provide an extra
thousand rooms.
</p>
<p>
There are solutions, Beck said. She noted this was the first year that
every continent had held its own Climate Week: a smaller event focusing
on more region-specific decarbonization challenges. This COP has also
seen the emergence of country coalitions that rally around different
issues or approaches. The set of countries that backed a pledge to
triple renewable capacity, for instance, is different from the smaller
coalition that wanted to triple nuclear capacity. These smaller, more
sector-specific coalitions may have more ability to actually decarbonize
and address climate change, she said.
</p>
<p>
For all these challenges, perhaps the biggest miracle is that the UNFCC
process works at all, Eve Tamme, a former climate negotiator for the
European Commission, told me.
</p>
<p>
“The UNFCCC process is based on consensus between almost 200 countries.
Judging based on the complexity of the issue at hand and the divergence
of views among the countries, it seems impossible that such a process
could deliver anything at all,” she said. Even when you follow the
negotiations closely, it may seem like there’s barely any movement at
all, she said.
</p>
<p>
“But then again, we got the Kyoto Protocol,” she said. “And we got the
Paris Agreement. So while it may look broken in the short term, somehow
this dysfunctional process can still deliver.”

Survivors Mark Hanukkah Amid Worries of Israel-Hamas War,
Antisemitism</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Berlin — Holocaust survivors from around the globe will mark the
start of the fifth day of Hanukkah together with a virtual ceremony as
Jews worldwide worry about the Israel-Hamas war and a spike of
antisemitism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Survivors can join an online ceremony of a menorah lighting Monday
night to pay tribute to the 6 million European Jews killed by the Nazis
in the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Several dozen survivors were also expected to gather in-person for a
menorah lighting at Jerusalem’s Western Wall — the holiest place where
Jews can pray.</p>
<p>“Holocaust survivors somehow overcame the depravity of concentration
camps, death camps and killing centers, among other horrors, to become
our living exemplars, providing a roadmap on how light can overcome
darkness,” Greg Schneider, the executive vice president of the
Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, said in remarks
released to The Associated Press ahead of the ceremony.</p>
<p>The New York-based conference is organizing the event in observance
of International Holocaust Survivors Night.</p>
<p>“Their resilience, their strength and their fortitude leave a truly
indelible light in this world,” Schneider added.</p>
<p>Hanukkah, also known as Judaism’s festival of lights, marks the
rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem in the 2nd century B.C., after a
small group of Jewish fighters known as the Maccabees liberated it from
occupying Syrian forces.</p>
<p>This year’s holiday comes as many Jews feel traumatized by Hamas’
deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and in which the
militants took some 240 as hostages. Israel responded with a bombing
campaign and a ground offensive that has so far killed more than 18,000
people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory’s Health Ministry.
The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant
deaths.</p>
<p>Several celebrities and world leaders spoke about the attack in
messages that were to be shown at the ceremony. German Chancellor Olaf
Scholz said “Hamas’ terrorist attack on Israel has affected us all
deeply. Something of abyssal evil broke free that day,” according to
comments released to the AP.</p>
<p>“The perpetrators’ motive is clear: They wanted to hit Israel,” the
chancellor added. “They wanted to murder Jews. In its repugnant
brutality and abhorrence, however, the terror is also directed against
humanity itself.”</p>
<p>Scholz, addressing Holocaust survivors, said he tries “to imagine how
much the images from Israel, how much antisemitic hatred on the internet
and on the streets around the world must be hitting you, of all people
right in the heart.”</p>
<p>“This … pains me a lot,” he said.</p>
<p>The virtual event, which starts at 8 p.m. Monday in Germany, will
also include musical performances, celebrity guests and messages from
Holocaust survivors from around the globe.</p>
<p>Leon Weintraub, a Holocaust survivor from Sweden, who was in Israel
during the Hamas attack, recounted what he experienced that day.</p>
<p>“On Oct. 7, I woke up from the sirens in the center of Tel Aviv. All
at once I was again in September 1939 when the Nazis invaded Poland,” he
said. “A terrible feeling, a shiver, a feeling of dread to be again in a
war.”</p>
<p>“We celebrate Chanukah now, the festival of lights. I hope that the
light will also bring the people enlightenment,” Weintraub added. “That
people will rethink and look at us people of Jewish descent as normal,
equal. Human beings.”</p>
<p>American comedian Billy Crystal, actress Jamie Lee Curtis and actor
Jason Alexander will also speak at the event, and there will also be a
by a musical performance from Grammy and Tony Award-winning singer Barry
Manilow, as well as the cast of Harmony.</p>

and macOS 14.2</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today, Apple pushed out the public releases of iOS 17.2, iPadOS 17.2,
macOS Sonoma 14.2, watchOS 10.2, and tvOS 17.2. iOS 17.2 and iPadOS
17.2’s flagship feature is the new Journal app, which Apple teased when
it first introduced iOS 17 earlier. The app mimics several existing
popular journaling apps in the App Store from third-party developers but
leverages data from your Photos, workouts, and other Apple apps to make
journaling suggestions. Other features include the ability to tap a
“catch-up arrow” to scroll to the first missed message in a conversation
in Messages, the ability to take spatial video photos for later viewing
on Vision Pro, and several tweaks and additions to the Weather app. ↫
Samuel Axon for Ars Technica Makers of journalling applications for iOS
are not going to be in a good mood today, I reckon.</p>
