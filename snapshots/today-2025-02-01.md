## What’s new in GTK, winter 2025 edition

date: 2025-02-01, from: Gtk Developer blog

We just had a GTK hackfest at FOSDEM. A good time for an update on whats new and exciting in GTK, with an eye towards 4.18. Requirements You can no longer call gdk_display_get_default() or gdk_display_open() before gtk_init(). This was causing problems due to incomplete initialization, so we made it fail with a (hopefully clear) error &#8230; <a href="https://blog.gtk.org/2025/02/01/whats-new-in-gtk-winter-2025-edition/" class="more-link">Continue reading<span class="screen-reader-text"> "What&#8217;s new in GTK, winter 2025 edition"</span></a>

2016: &quot;But there are technologies that went a different way. My favorite example is Manhattan&#39;s relationship to Central Park. The apartment buildings around the park are the money, and the creativity is in the park. The buildings are exclusive, the most expensive real estate in the world. The park is open to anyone, rich or poor, from anywhere in the world. &quot;

## OpenAI o3-mini, now available in LLM

date: 2025-01-31, updated: 2025-01-31, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p>OpenAI's <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/">o3-mini is out today</a>. As with other o-series models it's a slightly difficult one to evaluate - we now need to decide if a prompt is best run using GPT-4o, o1, o3-mini or (if we have access) o1 Pro.</p>
<p>Confusing matters further, the benchmarks in <a href="https://openai.com/index/o3-mini-system-card/">the o3-mini system card</a> (PDF) aren't a universal win for o3-mini across all categories. It generally benchmarks higher than GPT-4o and o1 but not across everything.</p>
<p>The biggest win for o3-mini is on the Codeforces ELO competitive programming benchmark, which I think is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01257">described by this 2nd January 2025 paper</a>, with the following scores:</p>
<ul>
<li>o3-mini (high) 2130</li>
<li>o3-mini (medium) 2036</li>
<li>o1 1891</li>
<li>o3-mini (low) 1831</li>
<li>o1-mini 1650</li>
<li>o1-preview 1258</li>
<li>GPT-4o 900</li>
</ul>
<p>Weirdly, that GPT-4o score was in an older copy of the System Card PDF which has been replaced by an updated document that doesn't mention Codeforces ELO scores at all.</p>
<p>One note from the System Card that stood out for me concerning intended applications of o3-mini for OpenAI themselves:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We also plan to allow users to use o3-mini to search the internet and summarize the results in ChatGPT. We expect o3-mini to be a useful and safe model for doing this, especially given its performance on the jailbreak and instruction hierarchy evals detailed in Section 4 below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is notable because the existing o1 models on ChatGPT have not yet had access to their web search tool - despite the mixture of search and "reasoning" models having very clear benefits.</p>
<p>o3-mini does not and <a href="https://twitter.com/nikunjhanda/status/1885415728624656481">will not</a> support vision. We will have to wait for future OpenAI reasoning models for that.</p>
<p>I released <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-21">LLM 0.21</a> with support for the new model, plus its <code>-o reasoning_effort high</code> (or <code>medium</code> or <code>low</code>) option for tweaking the reasoning effort - details <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/728">in this issue</a>.</p>
<p>Note that the new model is currently only available for <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/usage-tiers#tier-3-rate-limits">Tier 3</a> and higher users, which requires you to have spent at least $100 on the API.</p>
<p>o3-mini <a href="https://openai.com/api/pricing/">is priced</a> at $1.10/million input tokens, $4.40/million output tokens - less than half the price of GPT-4o (currently $2.50/$10) and massively cheaper than o1 ($15/60).</p>
<p>I tried using it to summarize <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42890627">this conversation about o3-mini on Hacker News</a>, using <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/claude-hacker-news-themes#user-content-adding-a--m-model-option">my hn-summary.sh script</a>.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>hn-summary.sh 42890627 -o o3-mini</pre></div>

<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/09e5922be0cbb85894cf05e6d75ae050">the result</a> - it used 18,936 input tokens and 2,905 output tokens for a total cost of 3.3612 cents.</p>

<p>Another characteristic worth noting is o3-mini's token output limit - the measure of how much text it can output in one go.  That's 100,000 tokens, compared to 16,000 for GPT-4o and just 8,000 for both DeepSeek R1 and Claude 3.5.</p>

<p>Invisible "reasoning tokens" come out of the same budget, so it's likely not possible to have it output the full 100,000.</p>

<p>The model accepts up to 200,000 tokens of input, an improvement on GPT-4o's 128,000.</p>

<p>An application where output limits really matter is translation between human languages, where the output can realistically be expected to have a similar length to the input. It will be interesting seeing how well o3-mini works for that, especially given its low price.</p>
<p>Update: Here's a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42894215#42895610">fascinating comment</a> on this by professional translator Tom Gally on Hacker News:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just did a test in which both R1 and o3-mini got worse at translation in the latter half of a long text. [...]</p>
<p>An initial comparison of the output suggested that, while R1 didn’t seem bad, o3-mini produced a writing style closer to what I asked for in the prompt—smoother and more natural English.
But then I noticed that the output length was 5,855 characters for R1, 9,052 characters for o3-mini, and 11,021 characters for my own polished version. Comparing the three translations side-by-side with the original Japanese, I discovered that R1 had omitted entire paragraphs toward the end of the speech, and that o3-mini had switched to a strange abbreviated style (using slashes instead of “and” between noun phrases, for example) toward the end as well. The vanilla versions of ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini that I ran the same prompt and text through a month ago had had none of those problems.</p>

## Latest black (25.1.0) adds a newline after docstring and before pass in an exception class

date: 2025-01-31, updated: 2025-01-31, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/psf/black/issues/4571">Latest black (25.1.0) adds a newline after docstring and before pass in an exception class</a></strong></p>
I filed a bug report against Black when the latest release - 25.1.0 - reformatted the following code to add an ugly (to me) newline between the docstring and the <code>pass</code>:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-v">ModelError</span>(<span class="pl-v">Exception</span>):
    <span class="pl-s">"Models can raise this error, which will be displayed to the user"</span>

    <span class="pl-k">pass</span></pre>

<p>Black maintainer Jelle Zijlstra confirmed that this is intended behavior with respect to <a href="https://github.com/psf/black/issues/4522">Black's 2025 stable style</a>, but also helped me understand that the <code>pass</code> there is actually unnecessary so I can fix the aesthetics by <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/commit/deb8bc3b4f5219583009eeb2c600d0b14c852c78">removing that entirely</a>.</p>
<p>I'm linking to this issue because it's a neat example of how I like to include steps-to-reproduce using <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/">uvx</a> to create one-liners you can paste into a terminal to see the bug that I'm reporting. In this case I shared the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's a way to see that happen using <code>uvx</code>. With the previous Black version:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre><span class="pl-c1">echo</span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>class ModelError(Exception):</span>
<span class="pl-s">    "Models can raise this error, which will be displayed to the user"</span>
<span class="pl-s">    pass<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> <span class="pl-k">|</span> uvx --with <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>black==24.10.0<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> black -</pre></div>
<p>This outputs:</p>
<pre><code>class ModelError(Exception):
    "Models can raise this error, which will be displayed to the user"
    pass
All done! ✨ 🍰 ✨
1 file left unchanged.
</code></pre>
<p>But if you bump to <code>25.1.0</code> this happens:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre><span class="pl-c1">echo</span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>class ModelError(Exception):</span>
<span class="pl-s">    "Models can raise this error, which will be displayed to the user"</span>
<span class="pl-s">    pass<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> <span class="pl-k">|</span> uvx --with <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>black==25.1.0<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> black - </pre></div>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>class ModelError(Exception):
    "Models can raise this error, which will be displayed to the user"

    pass
reformatted -

All done! ✨ 🍰 ✨
1 file reformatted.
</code></pre>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-solar-system">openai-realtime-solar-system</a></strong></p>
This was my favourite demo from OpenAI DevDay <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/1/openai-devday-2024-live-blog/#live-update-100">back in October</a> - a voice-driven exploration of the solar system, developed by Katia Gil Guzman, where you could say things out loud like "show me Mars" and it would zoom around showing you different planetary bodies.</p>
<p><img alt="Zoomed in on Mars. A log panel shows JSON on the right." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/openai-solar-mars.jpg" /></p>
<p>OpenAI <em>finally</em> released the code for it, now upgraded to use the new, easier to use WebRTC API they <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/17/openai-webrtc/">released in December</a>.</p>
<p>I ran it like this, loading my OpenAI API key using <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/help.html#llm-keys-get-help">llm keys get</a>:</p>
<pre><code>cd /tmp

cd openai-realtime-solar-system
npm install
OPENAI_API_KEY="$(llm keys get openai)" npm run dev

## The Twelve Labors of Hercules, First-Time Homebuyer

<p>Hercules, demigod and hero, in a fit of madness brought on by <span class="caps">FOMO</span> and too much <span class="caps">HGTV</span>, did consult with the Oracle of Delphi about buying a house. The Oracle, in her wisdom, and in partnership with Redfin, advised Hercules, “You know, there’s really never a bad time to get on the property ladder.” And thus, Hercules did put an offer in on a house, and he did cry out, “Oh shit,” when it was accepted, and subsequently, these Twelve Labors were imposed upon him.</p> <p>1.

Developers if they have had experience with platform vendors, assume that at some point the platform vendor will kill them. The question is can you find a way to get most of what you want before you are killed. ;-)

## Excerpts from The Believer: Ask Carrie

date: 2025-01-31, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://edge.mcsw.net/mcsweeneys/ww9rc6qt54npwimr3egxdglf6hfj" alt="" /></p> <h2>A quarterly column from Carrie Brownstein, who is better at dispensing advice than taking it.</h2> <p><span class="dropcap">Q:</span> <i>What is an appropriate amount of time to stay at your friend’s art show if you’re not interested in the social aspect of that kind of thing? I’m all about showing up to support people, but I find the conversations at these events so tedious and performative. And I hate who these events make me become: I find myself trying to fit in, while also judging my friends, who are all of a sudden talking differently and putting on airs. Should I just suffer through them?</i></p> <p><i>JD<br /> Los Angeles, CA</i></p> <p><span class="dropcap">A:</span> I went to college in a small town where we had to make our own fun. Lots of what we did was reimagine and emulate big-city functions like art openings, musicals, and fashion shows. Our events were scrappy, shambolic, and wonderful. They worked because we intentionally aimed for gilded and saw no value in actual gold. But when there’s a lack of self-awareness, these gatherings can feel performative and contrived. That being said, I now live in a medium-sized city, and the last time I attended one of these events, and felt my skin begin to crawl when confronted with a mid-Atlantic accent and Truman Capote cosplay, I started to think that maybe everyone—even in New York or Paris or London—is simply acting out an idea of what it means to be a partygoer or an art aficionado or an intellectual. So what is the appropriate amount of time to stay at your friend’s art show? However long you can stand to pretend along with the other fakers.</p> <div class='break'>- - -</div><p><span class="dropcap">Q:</span> <i>I’ve gone on a number of art museum dates, but I’m not sure how good of an idea they are. They’re starting to feel like screening tests that invariably detect a problem. On one occasion, I was with someone I seemed to have a lot in common with, but we ended up clashing over most of the canvases—he saw laziness where I saw fleeting beauty; he saw bold defiance where I saw petulant rebellion. It got so tense that we ended up leaving early.</p> <p>Another time, my date paused at nearly every painting to say something like “This painting is so me!” She projected herself onto everything, from portraits to landscapes, relating each one back to herself. Her constant self-comparison gave me the ick, and I decided to call things off.</p> <p>These experiences have me wondering if the art museum brings out the worst in my dates, or in me. Should I stop taking future dates there, or is this actually a good way to gauge someone’s character?</i></p> <p><i>Jess<br /> Chicago, IL</i></p> <p><span class="dropcap">A:</span> Clashing over art should not be a deal-breaker, as long as there is mutual respect in both delivery and intent, a willingness to entertain opposing views, and perhaps the concession that a right or wrong interpretation is beside the point. On the other hand, “This painting is so me!” is an absolute deal-breaker and your reaction was entirely appropriate. (At the very least, you’ve spared yourself from ever having to hear the words, “This breakup is so me!”)</p> <p>As to your question, I do wonder if museum-going is best left for further along in a potential relationship. While gently sparring over a painting or sculpture can be stimulating, it can be irksome too. Also irritating, I would think, is the constant affirmation and parroting of our own views. Plus, you need to be wary of the mutual desire to establish common interests early on, often while obfuscating more nuanced or even contrary predilections. And while you posit museum-going as a test of character, perhaps you’re simply struggling with the age-old quandary of whether opposites attract or if shared interests prevail. Or, to be less trite, maybe you deem yourself someone with good taste and are thus looking for someone else with good (i.e., your own) taste. No shame there! I probably wouldn’t date anyone who’d never heard of Poly Styrene or Elaine May.</p> <p>So might I suggest a deeper examination of what you’re looking for when you say “character.” My hunch is you could replace “museum” with just about any context, and face the same conundrum: finding a romantic partner, someone who really sees you and loves you for who you are, is really, really hard. It’s often easier to look for faults and reasons not to try. Therefore, maybe gauging good character is less about how a date responds to David Wojnarowicz and more about how vulnerable, silly, sexy, gross, smart, and just plain stupid you can be with someone, and finding someone who can be those same things around you. No judgment, no ridicule. A person you can trust not only with your excellent taste in culture, but with your heart. If art matters to you, witness it with someone who matters to you as well. Sigh. This answer is so me! (I’ll show myself out.)</p> <div class='break'>- - -</div><p style="text-align:center;"><i><strong><a href="https://www.thebeliever.net/ask-carrie-winter-2024/">Read the rest of Carrie&#8217;s advice over at The Believer.</a></strong></i></p>

## An Oral History of the Kidz Bop Cover of John Cage’s 4′33″

date: 2025-01-31, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<h4>Part One: The Kidz</h4> <p><strong>Dana Wilkinson, <i>Kidz Bop Producer</i>:</strong> People don’t remember this, but there was a draft in the early 2000s. We’d show up at some third-grader’s door, and they could only bring one duffle bag and a handful of their homeland’s soil with them. We called them the Kidz Korp.</p> <p><strong>Eileen Atwater, <i>Kidz Bop Kid</i>:</strong> The Kidz Korp was run by Irving “Big Irv” Schopenhauer, who was a studio exec from the 1940s.</p> <p><strong>Harry Collins, <i>Kidz Bop Kid</i>:</strong> Big Irv was strict but fair. We could only eat cat food and cigarettes, but we could have all the cat food and cigarettes we wanted.</p> <p><strong>Mike “Fancy Feast” Lewis, <i>Kidz Bop Kid</i> [<i>archival interview</i>]:</strong> We all ate the cat food. I don’t know why I’m the only one who got the nickname Fancy Feast… I’ll die a happy man if no one ever calls me Fancy Feast again.</p> <p>[<i>Ed. note: Mike “Fancy Feast” Lewis was killed in 2014 when his tanning bed fused shut and burst into flames.</i>]</p> <p><strong>Harry Collins:</strong> Fancy Feast said that? Crazy.</p> <h4>Part Two: The Piece</h4> <p><strong>Eileen Atwater:</strong> The whole idea behind John Cage’s <i>4′33″</i> was that the sounds of everyday life were just as interesting and engaging as those in a traditional piece of classical music.</p> <p><strong>Harry Collins:</strong> He wanted you to listen to the sounds you usually ignore. Like people breathing and birds chirping. I wasn’t all that excited about it, but they kept telling us that if we didn’t do what they said, they’d sell us to Randy Quaid, and he’d hunt us for sport. So yeah, we fell in line.</p> <p><strong>Harvey Roth:</strong> We were all terrified of Randy Quaid. The only movie they let us watch was <i>Caddyshack II</i>.</p> <p><strong>Irving “Big Irv” Schopenhauer [<i>archival interview</i>]:</strong> Well, ah, in the original piece, it’s mostly people fidgeting and coughing and stuff. It wasn’t very kid-oriented. So we thought, why not get a clown and let him do this thing? Then, we’ll get audio of the kids in the audience reacting.</p> <h4>Part Three: Showtime</h4> <p><strong>Dana Wilkinson:</strong> I don’t know where they found that fucking clown. I think they paid him in cough syrup.</p> <p><i>When the piece begins, the first sounds you can hear are some tentative giggles. Then, about forty-five seconds in, you hear Eileen Atwater’s distinctive gasp.</i></p> <p><strong>Eileen Atwater:</strong> People still recognize me, “Oh, are you the little girl who gasps in <i>4′33″</i>?” What they don’t know is that I gasped because the clown was trying to balance on a skateboard while holding two lit torches, and I guess I was the only one who saw it coming.</p> <p><strong>Harry Collins:</strong> The clown was juggling fire. We all knew that was [record executive] Al Hirschfield’s idea, because Al Hirschfield had a saying: “If a little fire is good, a lot of fire must be great!” Poor guy. No one ever explained fire to him, I guess.</p> <p><strong>Dana Wilkinson:</strong> Al Hirschfield? He was killed in 2014 when his tanning bed fused shut and burst into flames.</p> <p><i>In a cough-syrup-induced haze, the clown drops one of the torches. The curtains immediately ignite. That’s when the kids start screaming.</i></p> <p><strong>Mike “Fancy Feast” Lewis [<i>archival interview</i>]:</strong> The first wave of screams is playful, like maybe it was all planned. I don’t know; I was six, and I hadn’t slept in three months. I was hallucinating that my blood was alive and trying to escape out of my feet. I later found out I had mercury poisoning from all the cat food we were eating.</p> <p><strong>Dana Wilkinson:</strong> The curtains went up in flames, and the kids were stampeding toward the exit. I tried to throw some of the cat litter from the kids’ litter boxes on the clown, but I think he was already dead by that point.</p> <p><strong>Al Hirschfield [<i>archival interview</i>]:</strong> The only people who didn’t flee were me and Big Irv. He just kept screaming, “Keep rolling! Keep rolling!” That’s mostly what you hear in the finished recording: him yelling and me chanting the Mourner’s Kaddish for the clown.</p> <p><strong>Dana Wilkinson:</strong> Listen, if you’re gonna cry about every clown that dies during a Kidz Bop recording session, you’ll never get anything done. I learned that on my first day on the job.</p> <h4>Part Four: The Legacy</h4> <p><strong>Eileen Atwater:</strong> It’s nice that it’s had such an impact over the years.</p> <p><strong>Harry Collins:</strong> People come up to me all the time and are like, &#8220;Is it true you watched a clown burn to death, and they recorded it for a Kidz Bop album?&#8221; No one ever believes that to us, it was just another Tuesday.</p> <p><strong>Mike “Fancy Feast” Lewis [<i>archival interview</i>]:</strong> I can’t listen to it anymore. It just makes me crave cat food.</p> <p><i>Editor’s Note: </i>4′33″<i> composer John Cage passed away in 1992 when his tanning bed fused shut and burst into flames. His estate has formally denounced the Kidz Korp.</i></p>

## The surprising way to save memory with BytesIO

date: 2025-01-31, updated: 2025-01-31, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://pythonspeed.com/articles/bytesio-reduce-memory-usage/">The surprising way to save memory with BytesIO</a></strong></p>
Itamar Turner-Trauring explains that if you have a <code>BytesIO</code> object in Python calling <code>.read()</code> on it will create a full copy of that object, doubling the amount of memory used - but calling <code>.getvalue()</code> returns a <code>bytes</code> object that uses no additional memory, instead using copy-on-write.</p>
<p><code>.getbuffer()</code> is another memory-efficient option but it returns a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview">memoryview</a> which has less methods than the <code>bytes</code> you get back from <code>.getvalue()</code>- it doesn't have <code>.find()</code> for example.
