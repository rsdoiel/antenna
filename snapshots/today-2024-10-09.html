<p>
Medicare does not pay for general, long-term care. Now, Kamala Harris,
the Democrat’s candidate for president, wants to expand Medicare to pay
for long-term care for older people in their home. That would need an
amenable new Congress, but many families are presently left trying to
piece together care for older relatives. Also on today’s show: potential
structure changes to Google and the rising value of the U.S. dollar.

<li>IEA: Renewable capacity growth not enough to triple by 2030
</h3>
<p>
There are several big energy reports out this week, and taken together,
their findings tell a nuanced story of an energy transition that’s well
underway, but still moving too slowly. Let’s start with the big one: The
International Energy Agency’s
<a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/88a07dd9-42fe-4232-842e-9015b4b647f8/Renewables2024.pdf?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9y2MCHCJEqAXKW73y70FjwIrf39NV9JySPV_y9YgkmYvjFXnBKe_Q1yPjeBQOdC0XUy4wb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Renewables
2024</a> report, published this morning. It says that the world is on
track to add 5,500 gigawatts of new clean energy capacity by 2030, 80%
of which will come from solar PV alone. That means renewables will
account for half of global electricity generation by the end of the
decade.
</p>
<p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>
While this is huge progress (the report notes that 5,500 GW is roughly
equal the power capacity of China, the European Union, India, and the
U.S. combined), it is not enough to meet the COP28 goal of tripling
renewable capacity by 2030. But! The IEA stresses that it is “entirely
possible” to meet this target if governments can get their acts
together, set bold new emission reduction targets in the coming months,
and work together to lower the energy transition costs for poorer
countries. “The market can deliver on renewables, and now governments
need to prioritize investing in storage, grids, and other forms of clean
flexibility to enable this transformation,” said Dave Jones, director of
global insights at energy think tank Ember. “The next half decade is
going to be one heck of a ride.”
</p>
<p>
So, that’s renewables. Let’s look at what all this means for emissions
and, most importantly, warming.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Rhodium and DNV forecast 2100 warming levels
</h3>
<p>
An energy transition
<a href="https://www.dnv.com/news/eto-energy-related-emissions-will-peak-in-2024/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9y2MCHCJEqAXKW73y70FjwIrf39NV9JySPV_y9YgkmYvjFXnBKe_Q1yPjeBQOdC0XUy4wb" target="_blank">report</a>
published this morning from Norwegian risk management company DNV
concludes, rather remarkably, that energy-related emissions are set to
peak this year and begin a steady decline thanks to the plummeting costs
of solar and batteries, especially in China. “Emissions peaking is a
milestone for humanity,” said Remi Eriksen, group president and CEO of
DNV. However, the projected rate of emission reduction is only enough to
limit warming to <strong>2.2 degrees Celsius </strong>by 2100. “We must
now focus on how quickly emissions decline and use the available tools
to accelerate the energy transition,” Eriksen added.
</p>
<p>
The Rhodium
<a href="https://rhg.com/research/rhodium-climate-outlook-2024/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9y2MCHCJEqAXKW73y70FjwIrf39NV9JySPV_y9YgkmYvjFXnBKe_Q1yPjeBQOdC0XUy4wb" target="_blank">Climate
Outlook 2024</a> report, out yesterday, concluded that there is a less
than 7% chance of the world limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius
“if current trends in policy and technology development continue.” In
fact, it projected a “very likely” increase between<strong> 2 degrees
Celsius</strong> and <em>gulp</em> <strong>3.7 degrees Celsius
</strong>by century’s end. However, odds of limiting warming to 2
degrees jump to 96% if all countries can get to net-zero emissions by
2070. To date, 149 countries (representing 88% of global emissions) have
made net-zero or carbon neutrality commitments, though it remains to be
seen if and when they’ll meet those goals.

published yesterday in the journal <em>Joule</em>. The fuel is seen as
key to curbing emissions from hard-to-abate sectors (industry, for
example), and many are banking on the price of production falling. But
the researchers say the high storage and distribution costs are often
overlooked. Taking those costs into consideration, carbon capture and
storage is cheaper than green hydrogen when it comes to curbing
emissions, the researchers found. “Even if production costs decrease in
line with predictions, storage and distribution costs will prevent
hydrogen being cost-competitive in many sectors,”

id="study-climate-change-made-deadly-hurricane-helene-more-intense">Study:
Climate change made deadly Hurricane Helene more intense</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Hurricane Helene’s torrential rain and powerful winds
were made about 10% more intense due to climate change, according to a
study published Wednesday by the World Weather Attribution (WWA)
group.  </p>
<p>Although a 10% increase “might seem relatively small… that small
change in the hazard really leads to big change in impacts and damage,”
said climate scientist Friederike Otto, who heads the research
organization.  </p>
<p>The study also found that fossil fuels — the primary cause of climate
change — have made hurricanes like Helene 2.5 times more likely to
occur.  </p>
<p>In other words, storms of Helene’s magnitude were formerly
anticipated once every 130 years, but now the probability is closer to
once every 53 years, on average.  </p>
<p>To conduct the study, researchers focused on three aspects of
Hurricane Helene: precipitation, winds and the water temperature of the
Gulf of Mexico — a key factor in its formation.  </p>
<p>“All aspects of this event were amplified by climate change to
different degrees,” Ben Clarke, a co-author of the study and researcher
at Imperial College London, told a press conference.  </p>
<p>“And we’ll see more of the same as the world continues to warm,” he
continued.  </p>
<p>The research by WWA, an international group of scientists and
meteorologists who study the role of climate change in extreme weather
events, comes as the southeastern US state of Florida prepares for the
arrival of another major hurricane, Milton, just 10 days after it was
hit by Helene.   </p>
<p>Destruction</p>
<p>Helene made landfall in northwestern Florida on September 26 as a
Category 4 hurricane with winds up to 140 mph (225 kph).  </p>
<p>The storm then moved north, causing heavy rain and devastating floods
in several states, including North Carolina, where it claimed the
highest death toll.  </p>
<p>The authors of the study emphasized that the risk posed by hurricanes
has increased in scope beyond coastal areas.  </p>
<p>Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at NGO Climate Central,
said Helene “had so much intensity” that it would take time for it to
lose strength, but the “storm was moving fast… so it could go farther
inland pretty quickly.”  </p>
<p>This study utilized three methodologies to examine the three aspects
of the storm, and was conducted by researchers from the US, the UK,
Sweden and the Netherlands.  </p>
<p>To study its rainfall, researchers used an approach based on both
observation and climate models, depending on the two regions involved:
one for coastal areas like Florida, and another for inland areas like
the Appalachian mountains.  </p>
<p>In both cases, the study found precipitation had increased by 10
percent because of global warming, which is currently at 1.3 degrees
Celsius above pre-industrial levels.  </p>
<p>To study Helene’s winds, scientists looked at hurricane data dating
back as far as 1900.  </p>
<p>They determined Helene’s winds were 11 percent stronger, or 13 mph
(21 kph), as a result of climate change.  </p>
<p>Lastly, the researchers examined the water temperature in the Gulf of
Mexico, where Helene formed, finding it was around 2 degrees Celsius
above normal.  </p>
<p>This record temperature was made 200 to 500 times more likely due to
climate change, the study asserts.  </p>
<p>Warmer oceans release more water vapor, providing more energy for
storms as they form.  </p>
<p>“If humans continue to burn fossil fuels, the US will face even more
destructive hurricanes,” Clarke warned in a statement.</p>

How can you fight climate change in your daily life? Last month, Heatmap
published our attempt at answering that question: Called Decarbonize
Your Life, it’s a series of stories and guides to help you make better,
smarter decisions to nudge the energy system away from fossil fuels. We
consulted studies, ran our own analysis (with a little help from some
friends), and used our expert judgment to arrive at six big,
high-leverage actions you can take to fight climate change and cut
carbon pollution.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>So it’s more than just the carbon impact
which is the key here, right? This systemic leverage point that you’re
trying to make is that you’re trying to think about — beyond just
reducing emissions, which is important — how is that actually having
some kind of systemic impact on reorienting the global capitalist
system, right? That we all live in, towards where we want to go, towards
what a net zero emissions lifestyle and society looks like.<br/> <br/>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>And instead of every dollar you spend
going to the task of taking oil out of the ground, and the task of
building more internal combustion cars, it’s going to the task of
building more EVs and harvesting electricity. Anyway, Jillian, I
interrupted you.<br/> <br/> <strong>Jillian Goodman: </strong>I was just
going to add — and again, I’m just paraphrasing you — every time you
drive, it’s a marginal impact. Every single time you use the device. Not
only are you emitting less in the short term, you’re emitting less in
the long term. And as the grid gets cleaner, every time you drive your
EV, your EV will get cleaner, as well.<br/> <br/> <strong>Emily
Pontecorvo:</strong> One other thing that we were thinking about a
little bit is thinking about these actions in terms of, which ones are
you, as an individual, you’re literally the one who’s burning the fossil
fuels. When you drive your car, you are burning the gas. When you’re
lighting your stove, you’re burning natural gas. And not to put it all
on the individual, but you’re the one who has the power to say,
<em><em>Okay, I’m not gonna burn fossil fuels in my home
anymore.</em></em> And whereas with a few other actions — like with
rooftop solar, with efficiency improvements — those are extremely
important, and those are very high on our list for other reasons. But
they’re more indirect.

<h2 id="us-considers-breakup-of-google-in-landmark-search-case">US
considers breakup of Google in landmark search case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — The U.S. said on Tuesday it may ask a judge to force
Alphabet’s Google to divest parts of its business, such as its Chrome
browser and Android operating system, that it says are used to maintain
an illegal monopoly in online search.</p>
<p>In a landmark case, a judge in August found that Google, which
processes 90% of U.S. internet searches, had built an illegal monopoly.
The Justice Department’s proposed remedies have the potential to reshape
how Americans find information on the internet while shrinking Google’s
revenues and giving its competitors more room to grow.</p>
<p>“Fully remedying these harms requires not only ending Google’s
control of distribution today, but also ensuring Google cannot control
the distribution of tomorrow,” the Justice Department said.</p>
<p>The proposed fixes will also aim to keep Google’s past dominance from
extending to the burgeoning business of artificial intelligence,
prosecutors said.</p>
<p>The Justice Department might also ask the court to end Google’s
payments to have its search engine pre-installed or set as the default
on new devices.</p>
<p>Google has made annual payments - $26.3 billion in 2021 - to
companies including Apple and other device manufacturers to ensure that
its search engine remained the default on smartphones and browsers,
keeping its market share strong.</p>
<p>Google, which plans to appeal, said in a corporate blog post that the
proposals were “radical” and said they “go far beyond the specific legal
issues in this case.”</p>
<p>Google maintains that its search engine has won users with its
quality, adding that it faces robust competition from Amazon and other
sites, and that users can choose other search engines as their
default.</p>
<p>The world’s fourth-largest company with a market capitalization of
over $2 trillion, Alphabet is under mounting legal pressure from
competitors and antitrust authorities.</p>
<p>A U.S. judge ruled on Monday in a separate case, that Google must
open up its lucrative app store, Play, to greater competition, including
making Android apps available from rival sources. Google is also
fighting a Justice Department case that seeks the breakup of its web
advertising business.</p>
<p>As part of its efforts to prevent Google’s dominance from extending
into AI, the Justice Department said it may seek to make available to
rivals the indexes, data and models it uses for Google search and
AI-assisted search features.</p>
<p>Other orders prosecutors may seek include restricting Google from
entering agreements that limit other AI competitors’ access to web
content and letting websites opt out of Google using their content to
train AI models.</p>
<p>Google said the AI-related proposals could stifle the sector.</p>
<p>“There are enormous risks to the government putting its thumb on the
scale of this vital industry — skewing investment, distorting
incentives, hobbling emerging business models — all at precisely the
moment that we need to encourage investment,” Google said.</p>
<p>The Justice Department is expected to file a more detailed proposal
with the court by Nov. 20. Google will have a chance to propose its own
remedies by Dec. 20.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta’s ruling in Washington was a major win
for antitrust enforcers who have brought an ambitious set of cases
against Big Tech companies over the past four years.</p>
<p>The U.S. has also sued Meta Platforms, Amazon.com and Apple claiming
they illegally maintain monopolies.</p>
<p>Some of the ideas in the Justice Department’s proposals to break up
Google had previously garnered support from Google’s smaller competitors
such as reviews site Yelp and rival search engine company
DuckDuckGo.</p>
<p>Yelp, which sued Google over search in August, says spinning off
Google’s Chrome browser and AI services should be on the table. Yelp
also wants Google to be prohibited from giving preference to Google’s
local business pages in search results.</p>

id="grazer-beats-the-behemoth-that-killed-her-cub-to-win-alaskas-fat-bear-contest">Grazer
beats the behemoth that killed her cub to win Alaska’s Fat Bear
Contest</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ANCHORAGE, Alaska — In a storyline better befitting a melodrama than
a popularity vote, Grazer won her second Fat Bear Contest Tuesday by
defeating the male behemoth that killed her cub this summer.</p>
<p>Grazer beat Chunk by more than 40,000 votes cast by fans watching
live cameras at explore.org of Alaska’s Katmai National Park and
Preserve.</p>
<p>Fans cast votes online for their favorite chunky competitor in
tournament-style brackets that begins with 12 bears. They picked the
bear they believe best exemplifies winter preparedness by the fat they
have accumulated over the summer feeding on the sockeye salmon that
return to Brooks River.</p>
<p>The bears often perch at the top of a falls in the river, grabbing
leaping salmon out of the air as the fish attempt to hurdle the
waterfall to spawn upstream.</p>
<p>This is where Grazer’s cub died after it slipped over the waterfall
and was killed by Chunk, perhaps the most dominant brown bear on the
river. Grazer fought Chunk in an effort to save the cub, but it later
died. The death was captured on the live cameras.</p>
<p>Another death was captured live by the cameras just last week,
delaying the release of the tournament bracket for a day. Bear 402, a
female bear that was supposed to be a contestant in this year’s contest,
was killed by a male brown bear the day the brackets were expected to be
released.</p>
<p>Grazer has conspicuously blond ears and a long, straight muzzle,
according to her bio page at explore.org.</p>
<p>“She is a formidable presence on Brooks River. Her fearlessness and
strength have earned her respect, with most bears avoiding
confrontation,” it says.</p>
<p>Her other surviving cub from her third litter placed second two weeks
ago in the Fat Bear Junior contest.</p>
<p>Chunk is perhaps the largest bear on the river, with narrow-set eyes,
dark brown fur and a distinctive scar across his muzzle, his bio says.
He used his size to rise to the top of the river hierarchy this year and
secured the prime fishing spots.</p>
<p>“Chunk’s confidence and aggression paid off, allowing him to feast on
42 salmon in 10 hours,” it says. “His physical success is evident in his
bulky form.”</p>
<p>Adult male brown bears typically weigh 270 to 410 kilograms in

presidential election. With a history of extremely close races,
Wisconsin’s 10 electoral votes could determine who becomes the next
president. The state’s unique mix of urban and rural voters, along with
key issues like the economy and abortion rights, make it a microcosm of

Climate Change Is Supercharging Hurricane Milton</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p>
Contrary to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-milton-misinformation" target="_self"><u>recent
rumor</u></a>, the U.S. government cannot direct major hurricanes like
Helene and Milton toward red states. According to two new rapid
attribution studies by World Weather Attribution and
<a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/hurricane-rapid-intensification?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Climate%20Shift%20Index%20Alert%20-%20Hurricane%20Milton%20Oct%207%202024&utm_content=Climate%20Shift%20Index%20Alert%20-%20Hurricane%20Milton%20Oct%207%202024+CID_5a4c73076a532c0cb91ebd2b7e99e07f&utm_source=Climate%20Central%20Email%20Campaign%20Monitor&utm_term=extreme%20rapid%20intensification" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Climate
Central</u></a>, however, human actors almost certainly made the storms
a lot worse through the burning of fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
A storm like Hurricane Helene, which has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-death-study" target="_self"><u>killed
at least 227 people so far</u></a> and caused close to
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/07/business/property-damange-hurricane-helene-47-billion/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$50
billion in estimated property losses</u></a> across the southeast, is
about two-and-a-half times more likely in the region today compared to
what would be expected in a “cooler pre-industrial climate,” WWA found.
That means Helene, the kind of storm one would expect to see once every
130 years on average, is now expected to develop at a rate of about once
every 53 years. Additionally, WWA researchers determined that extreme
rainfall from Helene was 70% more likely and 10% heavier in the
Appalachians and about 40% more likely in the southern Appalachian
region, where many of the deaths occurred, due to climate change.
</p>
<p>
“Americans shouldn’t have to fear hurricanes more violent than Helene —
we have all the knowledge and technology needed to lower demand and
replace oil, gas, and coal with renewable energy,” Friederike Otto, the
lead of WWA and a senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College
London, said in a statement. “But vitally, we need the political will.”
Alarmingly, the attribution study found that storms could drop an
additional 10% or more rain on average as soon as the 2050s if warming
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/year-warming-paris-agreement" target="_self"><u>reaches</u></a>
2 degrees Celsius.
</p>
<p>
WWA’s study is
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/helene-rainfall-boosted-human-driven-climate-change-studies-find-rcna173608" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not
the first</a> to be released on Hurricane Helene, but it was still
produced incredibly quickly and has not been peer reviewed. Just a few
weeks ago, the group issued a correction on a report estimating the
contribution of climate change to recent
<a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-and-high-exposure-increased-costs-and-disruption-to-lives-and-livelihoods-from-flooding-associated-with-exceptionally-heavy-rainfall-in-central-europe/" target="_blank">flooding
in Europe</a>.
</p>
<p>
Separately, Climate Central looked at Hurricane Milton, which already
has the distinction of being
<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/hurricane-milton-category-5-storm-fifth-strongest-ever-atlantic-1965604" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
fifth strongest</u></a> Atlantic storm on record. The nonprofit’s
findings show that Milton’s rapid intensification — one of
<a href="https://theconversation.com/hurricane-milton-explodes-into-a-powerful-category-5-storm-as-it-heads-for-florida-heres-how-rapid-intensification-works-240754" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
fastest and most powerful</u></a> instances of the phenomenon in history
— is primarily due to high
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-season-2024" target="_self"><u>sea
surface temperatures</u></a> in the weeks before Milton developed, which
was made at least 400 times more likely by climate change and up to 800
times more likely. (WWA relied on Climate Central’s Climate Shift Index
for oceans for its research, but found “climate change made the
unusually hot sea surface temperature about 200-500 times more likely.”)
</p>
<p>
Attribution science is incredibly tricky, especially for a storm system
like a hurricane that has variables ranging from wind shear to the El
Niño–Southern Oscillation to ocean temperatures and jet stream
variations. When
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/is-extreme-weather-climate-change" target="_self"><u>I
spoke to a member of the WWA team earlier this year</u></a>, I was told
the organization specifically avoids attributing the intensification of
any <em><em>individual</em></em> hurricane — in theory, one of the more
straightforward relationships — to climate change because of the
relatively limited historical modeling available. Even something like
rainfall “is not necessarily correlated to the magnitude of the floods
that you see because there are other factors,” WWA’s Clair Barnes
previously told me — for example, the steep-sided mountains and hollows
of western North Carolina, which served as funnels for rainfall to an
especially devastating effect.
</p>
<p>
But regarding the relationship between hurricanes and climate change
more generally, “We’re relatively confident that storms will get more
intense” in a warming world, Gabriel Vecchi, a Princeton geoscientist,
explained on
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-s2-hurricane-helene" target="_self"><u>a
recent episode of Heatmap’s Shift Key</u></a> podcast. “And we’re
<em><em>really </em></em>confident that storms will get wetter.”
</p>
<p>
Helene and Milton hammer that point home: once-in-a-generation storms
can now arrive on back-to-back weekends. You can almost understand the
impulse to devise a zany explanation as to why. Only, the truth is far
simpler than cloud seeding or
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-maui-fire-photos-misrepresented-conspiracy-555091357957" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>space
lasers</u></a>: a warmer atmosphere makes for warmer oceans, which make
for wetter, more intense storms. And while hurricane seasons
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/2024-hurricane-season-helene#:~:text=a%20couple%20of%20named%20storms%20in%20November%2C" target="_self"><u>eventually
end</u></a>, global temperatures
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/climate-track-warm-by-nearly-3c-without-greater-ambition-un-report-2023-11-20/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>haven’t
stopped going up</u></a>. That, perhaps, is the more terrifying subtext
of the attribution studies: There will be more Miltons and Helenes.

arrests Afghan man officials say plotted Election Day attack in US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The FBI has arrested an Afghan man who officials say was
inspired by the Islamic State militant organization and was plotting an
Election Day attack targeting large crowds in the United States, the
Justice Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, told
investigators after his arrest Monday that he had planned his attack to
coincide with Election Day next month and that he and a juvenile
co-conspirator expected to die as martyrs, according to charging
documents. </p>
<p>Tawhedi, who entered the U.S. in 2021 on a special immigrant visa,
had taken steps in recent weeks to advance his attack plans, including
by ordering AK-47 rifles, liquidating his family’s assets, and buying
one-way tickets for his wife and child to travel home to
Afghanistan. </p>
<p>“Terrorism is still the FBI’s number one priority, and we will use
every resource to protect the American people,” FBI Director Christopher
Wray said in a statement. </p>
<p>After he was arrested, the Justice Department said, Tawhedi told
investigators he had planned an attack for Election Day that would
target large gatherings of people. </p>
<p>Tawhedi was charged with conspiring and attempting to provide
material support to the Islamic State group, which is designated by the
U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization. </p>
<p>It was not immediately clear if he had a lawyer who could speak on
his behalf.</p>

stresses desire for peaceful resolution of Taiwan disputes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A top U.S. official said the United States expects
differences across the Taiwan Strait to be resolved peacefully and
opposes any unilateral changes to the status quo as Taiwan prepares to
celebrate the founding of the Republic of China on Thursday.</p>
<p>The People’s Republic of China, or PRC, celebrates its national day
on October 1, marking the founding of the country in 1949. Taiwan
chooses October 10, known as Double Ten Day, to celebrate the founding
of the ROC in 1912, just months after an uprising that began on October
10, 1911.</p>
<p>The PRC typically closely monitors speeches from Taiwan’s leaders
during Double Ten Day celebrations. Since Taiwan’s democratically
elected President Lai Ching-te took office in May, Beijing has increased
military pressure on Taiwan, deeming Lai a “separatist.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific
Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink said that the U.S.’s “fundamental interest is
in the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,”
reiterating that Washington’s longstanding One China policy remains
unchanged, “guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Joint
Communiques and the Six Assurances.”</p>
<p>“We oppose unilateral changes to the status quo by either side. We do
not support Taiwan independence, and we expect cross-strait differences
to be resolved peacefully,” Kritenbrink told VOA during a briefing.</p>
<p>Speaking at an event Saturday, Lai noted that the PRC celebrated its
75th anniversary on October 1, and in a few days, it would be the ROC’s
113th birthday.</p>
<p>“In terms of age, it is absolutely impossible for the People’s
Republic of China to be considered the motherland of the people of the
Republic of China. On the contrary, the ROC may be the motherland of the
people of the PRC who are over 75 years old,” Lai told an audience in
Taipei.</p>
<p>PRC officials have remained largely muted on Lai’s remarks, but some
analysts say that could be because Beijing is preparing to launch
another round of military exercises after Lai delivers his Double Ten
Day speech.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have referred inquiries to “President Lai’s office for
any commentary on his specific comments.”</p>
<p>European visit</p>
<p>Meanwhile, former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen will visit the
Czech Republic this month, a visit seen as sensitive since Beijing has
repeatedly denounced the democratic leader as a “separatist.”</p>
<p>In Beijing on Tuesday, a spokesperson from the PRC’s Ministry of
Foreign Affairs was asked to comment on Tsai’s planned visit to
Prague.</p>
<p>“We firmly oppose anyone who seeks “Taiwan independence” visiting
countries with diplomatic ties with China under any pretext. We urge the
Czech Republic and relevant countries to earnestly abide by the One
China principle and respect China’s sovereignty and territorial
integrity,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told
reporters Tuesday.</p>
<p>Taiwan has been self-ruled since 1949, when Mao Zedong’s communists
took power in Beijing after defeating Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang
nationalists in a civil war, prompting the nationalists’ relocation to
the island.</p>
<p>The U.S. does not maintain an official relationship with Taiwan but
provides defense equipment to the self-ruled democracy under the Taiwan
Relations Act.</p>
<p>Treaty of Aigun</p>
<p>In a TV interview in September, Lai remarked that if China’s claims
over Taiwan are genuinely rooted in concerns about territorial
integrity, it should also seek to reclaim the land it ceded to Russia in
the 19th century.</p>
<p>He referenced the 1858 Treaty of Aigun, through which China, under
the Qing dynasty, gave up a vast area of land — now part of Russia’s Far
East — to the Russian Empire, establishing much of the modern border
along the Amur River.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Aigun, along with the 1860 Convention of Peking, saw
China relinquish 600,000 square kilometers — an area almost the size of
Ukraine — to the Russian Empire, enabling Russia to establish a naval
base at Vladivostok. Many Chinese people still brood over this period of
history, harboring lingering resentment over the fact that the land once
belonged to China before being annexed by Russia.</p>
<p>In 2023, China’s Ministry of Natural Resources mandated that new maps
use Chinese names for Vladivostok — Haishenwai — as well as several
other cities in the region.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-use-kde">Why I use KDE</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Over the decades, my primary operating system of choice has changed a
few times. As a wee child of six years old, we got out first PC through
one of those employer buy-a-PC programs, where an employer would
subsidize its employees buying PCs for use in the home. The goal here
was simple: if people get comfortable with a computer in their private
life, they’ll also get comfortable with it in their professional life.
And so, through my mother’s employer, we got a brand new 286 desktop
running MS-DOS and Windows 3.0. I still have the massive and detailed
manuals and original installation floppies it came with. So, my first
operating system of ‘choice’ was MS-DOS, and to a far lesser extent
Windows 3.0. As my childhood progressed, we got progressively better
computers, and the new Windows versions that came with it – Windows 95,
98, and yes, even ME, which I remarkably liked just fine. Starting with
Windows 95, DOS became an afterthought, and with my schools, too, being
entirely Windows-only, my teenage years were all Windows, all the time.
So, when I bought my first own, brand new computer – instead of old 386
machines my parents took home from work – right around when Windows XP
came out, I bought a totally legal copy of Windows XP from some dude at
school that somehow came on a CD-R with a handwritten label but was
really totally legit you guys. I didn’t like Windows XP at all, and
immediately started looking for alternatives, trying out Mandrake Linux
before discovering something called BeOS – and despite BeOS already
being over by that point, I had found my operating system of choice. I
tried to make it last as long as the BeOS community would let me, but
that wasn’t very long. The next step was a move to the Mac, something
that was quite rare in The Netherlands at that time. During that same
time, Microsoft released Windows Server 2003, the actually good version
of Windows XP, and a vibrant community of people, including myself,
started using it as a desktop operating system instead. I continued
using this mix of Mac OS X and Windows – even Vista – for a long time,
while having various iterations of Linux installed on the side. I
eventually lost interest in Mac OS X because Apple lost interest in it
(I think around the Snow Leopard era?), and years later, six or seven
years ago or so, I moved to Linux exclusively, fully ditching Windows
even for gaming like four or so years ago when Valve’s Proton started
picking up steam. Nowadays all my machines run Fedora KDE, which I
consider to be by far the best desktop operating system experience you
can get today. Over the last few years or so, I’ve noticed something fun
and interesting in how I set up my machines: you can find hints of my
operating system history all over my preferred setup and settings. I
picked up all kinds of usage patterns and expectations from all those
different operating systems, and I’d like to enable as many of those as
possible in my computing environment. In a way, my setup is a reflection
of the operating systems I used in the past, an archaeological record of
my computing history, an evolutionary tree of good traits that survived,
and bad traits bred out. Taking a look at my bare desktop, you’ll
instantly pick up on the fact I used to use Mac OS X for a long time.
The Mac OS X-like dock at the bottom of the screen has been my preferred
way of opening and managing running applications since I first got an
iBook G4 more than 20 years ago, and to this day I find it far superior
to any alternatives. KDE lets me easily recreate a proper dock, without
having to resort to any third-party dock applications. I never liked the
magnification trick Mac OS X wowed audiences with when it was new, so I
don’t use it. The next dead giveaway I used to be a Mac OS X user a long
time ago is the top bar, which shares quite a few elements with the Mac
OS X menubar, while also containing elements not found in Mac OS X. I
keep the KDE equivalent of a start menu there, a button that brings up
my home folder in a KDE folder view, a show desktop button that’s mostly
there for aesthetic reasons, KDE’s global menubar widget for that Mac OS
X feel, a system tray, the clock, and then a close button that opens up
a custom system menu with shutdown/reboot/etc. commands and some
shortcuts to system tools. Another feature coming straight from my days
using Mac OS X is KDE’s equivalent of Exposé, called Overview, without
which I wouldn’t know how to find a window if my life depended on it. I
bind it to the top-left hotcorner for easy access with my mouse, while
the bottom-right hotcorner is set to show my desktop (and the reason why
I technically don’t really need that show desktop button I mentioned
earlier). I fiddled with the hot corner trigger timings so that they
fire virtually instantly. Waiting on my computer is so ’90s. It’s not
really possible to see in screenshots, but my stint using BeOS as my
main operating system back when that was a thing you could do also
shines through, specifically in the way I manage windows. In BeOS,
double-clicking a titlebar tab would minimise a window, and
right-clicking the tab would send the window to the bottom of the
Z-stack. I haven’t maximised a non-video window in several decades, so I
find double-clicking a titlebar to maximise a window utterly baffling,
and a ridiculous Windows-ism I want nothing to do with. Once again, KDE
lets me set this up exactly the way I want, and I genuinely feel lost
when I can’t manipulate my windows in this</p>

id="us-looks-to-resurrect-more-nuclear-reactors-white-house-adviser-says">US
looks to resurrect more nuclear reactors, White House adviser says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — The Biden administration is working on plans to bring
additional decommissioned nuclear power reactors back online to help
meet soaring demand for emissions-free electricity, White House climate
adviser Ali Zaidi said Monday. </p>
<p>Two such projects are already under way, including the planned
recommissioning of Holtec’s Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan and the
potential restart of a unit at Constellation Energy’s Three Mile Island
plant in Pennsylvania, near the site of the worst nuclear accident in
U.S. history. </p>
<p>Asked if additional shuttered plants could be restarted, Zaidi said,
“We’re working on it in a very concrete way. There are two that I can
think of.” </p>
<p>He declined to identify the power plants or provide further details
about the effort. </p>
<p>Speaking at the Reuters IMPACT conference in New York, Zaidi said
repowering existing dormant nuclear plants was part of a three-pronged
strategy of President Joe Biden’s administration to bring more nuclear
power online to fight climate change and boost production. </p>
<p>The other two prongs include development of small modular reactors
(SMRs) for certain applications, and continuing development of next
generation, advanced nuclear reactors. </p>
<p>Biden has called for a tripling of U.S. nuclear power capacity to
fuel energy demand that is accelerating in part due to expansion of
power-hungry technologies like artificial intelligence and cloud
computing. </p>
<p>Last week, the Biden administration said it closed a $1.52 billion
loan to resurrect the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan, which would
take two years to reopen. </p>
<p>Constellation and Microsoft, meanwhile, signed a power deal last
month to help resurrect a unit of the Pennsylvania plant, which
Constellation hopes will also receive government support. </p>
<p>Zaidi told the conference that the U.S. Navy on Monday had requested
information to build SMRs on a six bases. “SMR is a technology that is
not a decades-away play. It’s one that companies in the United States
are looking to deploy in this decade,” he said. </p>
<p>Zaidi also addressed the woes that have beset a separate Biden clean
energy goal, to bring 30 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity online by
the end of the decade. </p>
<p>The administration shelved offshore wind lease sales this year in
both Oregon and the Gulf of Mexico due to low demand from companies, as
high costs, equipment issues and supply chain challenges hit other
projects. </p>
<p>Zaidi said at least half of the 30GW goal is already under
construction and that some of the early snags provide helpful learning
for future projects. </p>
<p>“I am pretty optimistic about the next wave of projects where we will
have a domestic supply chain and hopefully better cost to capital
relative to what projects are facing right now,” he said.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
There’s a familiar script when it comes to hurricanes: The high winds
snap tree branches and even tree trunks and whip around anything else
that’s light enough or not bolted down — including power lines and
distribution poles. While this type of damage can lead to large-scale
outages, it’s also relatively straightforward to fix. In many cases the
power comes back on relatively quickly, more like days rather than weeks
or months.
</p>
<p>
But when it comes to flooding, especially in areas that do not regularly
deal with big storms, the damage can be more severe, long-lasting, and
difficult to repair. This is largely because what’s at risk in these
scenarios is not power lines but substations. These messes of
transmission and distribution lines that channel high voltage power to
homes and businesses are vulnerable to rising water, and repairs can’t
begin until the floodwaters recede. Often they have to be replaced
entirely, which is expensive and can lead to further delays as
<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-06/DRAFT_NIAC_Addressing%20the%20Critical%20Shortage%20of%20Power%20Transformers%20to%20Ensure%20Reliability%20of%20the%20U.S.%20Grid_Report_06052024_508c.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>there’s
a nationwide shortage</u></a> of transformers. Just one substation can
support thousands of homes — a single point of failure that, when it
floods, takes all its customers down with it.
</p>
<p>
Duke Energy, whose grid in the Carolinas was pummeled by Hurricane
Helene,
<a href="https://news.duke-energy.com/releases/duke-energys-hurricane-helene-recovery-restores-power-to-nearly-1-1-million-in-the-carolinas-downed-trees-blocked-roadways-damaged-power-equipment-impeding-efforts-in-the-n-c-mountains-and-s-c-upstate-region" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
said</u></a> the damage to its system encompasses “submerged
substations, thousands of downed utility poles, and downed transmission
towers,” and noted that much of the affected area is “inaccessible due
to mudslides, flooding and blocked roads, limiting the ability to assess
and begin repairing damages.” In an update published Saturday, it stated
that while more than 2 million customers had seen their power
<a href="https://news.duke-energy.com/releases/duke-energy-restores-90-of-carolinas-customers-capable-of-receiving-power-following-helene" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>restored</u></a>,
about 250,000 customers across North and South Carolina remained without
electricity more than a week after the storm.
</p>
<p>
Workers are “encountering more severe damage on a larger scale than
we’ve ever experienced,” Duke Energy storm director Jason Hollifield
said in a statement. (Duke didn’t respond to my request for comment.)
One Duke employee
<a href="https://abc11.com/post/helene-power-outages-wnc-duke-energy-substation-extensive-damage-biltmore-swannanoa-river/15392801/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told
the local television station</u></a> in Asheville, North Carolina, which
saw more than three months’ worth of rain fall over three days, that a
local substation would have to be completely rebuilt, a process that
could take months. In Western North Carolina, the area’s Representative
Chuck Edwards has
<a href="https://edwards.house.gov/media/press-releases/hurricane-helene-update-10-congressman-edwards" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>estimated</u></a>
that 117,000 customers still lack electricity, and that while some of
them will likely get it back by Sunday, others “whose properties are
inaccessible or not able to receive power may be without electricity for
an extended period of time as Duke Energy works to rebuild critical
infrastructure.”
</p>
<p>
To prepare for the onrushing Hurricane Milton, Duke
<a href="https://news.duke-energy.com/releases/duke-energy-florida-increases-resource-count-to-16-000-encourages-customers-to-take-appropriate-safety-measures-prior-to-hurricane-miltons-landfall" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>is
staging thousands o</u></a>f “line technicians, vegetation workers,
damage assessors and support personnel” in Florida, the company said.
The same problem remains, however: Line technicians will not prevent
substations from flooding.
</p>
<p>
While the exact effect of climate change on hurricanes and other storm
categories is an area of intense debate among climate scientists and
meteorologists, there’s a rough consensus that
<a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2019/10/29/why-are-big-storms-bringing-so-much-more-rain-warming-yes-also-winds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>warming
will cause the storms to be wetter</u></a>. That means utilities will
have to update their old disaster response playbooks, or else prolonged
outages when an especially wet storm arrives over a flood plain.
</p>
<p>
In most hurricanes, utilities are able to pre-position workers to
restore power quickly, working on knocked down poles and wires,
explained Jordan Kern, an assistant professor engineering at North
Carolina State University. “When trees fall on distribution lines, those
are, in normal situations, easy to repair,” he told me. But, Kern said,
“If the substations are flooded, you can’t do anything until the flood
waters go down. They can be without power for a long time.”
</p>
<p>
Wetter hurricanes will likely mean more severe and less predictable
flooding happening far away from the coasts, bringing with it risks that
utilities and local governments may be less prepared to face, with costs
that will ultimately be born by anyone who pays for electricity, as
expensive repairs and hardening of electrical infrastructure will likely
be born by ratepayers.
</p>
<p>
“Rates will necessarily rise” to deal with the higher costs of
adaptation and repairing infrastructure more complex than a wooden pole,
Tyler Norris, a PhD student at Duke University’s Nicholas School of the
Environment, told me while driving towards Asheville to help out family
impacted by the storm.
</p>
<p>
While Helene has been an especially damaging storm, the risks of wetter
storms and inland flooding away from the coastal areas that are prepared
for frequent hurricanes have become more apparent in recent years. While
Hurricane Irene in 2011 made landfall on Long Island, its
<a href="https://www.weather.gov/gyx/Irene_Anniversary" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>most
devastating effects were felt inland</u></a> due to heavy rains,
especially in Vermont.
</p>
<p>
North Carolina in particular has seen a rash of nasty hurricanes in the
past 10 years or so, giving Duke ample recent experience with big storms
— and some indication of what a warming world could bring.
</p>
<p>
During 2018’s Hurricane Florence, which knocked out power for around a
million Duke customers, “at least 10 substations required
de-energization due to flooding or flood risk where heavy rainfall and
resulting inland flooding,”
<a href="https://www.duke-energy.com/-/media/pdfs/our-company/carolinasresiliencetransmissiondistributionstudy.pdf?rev=035db100f60b4c6a8b81e5a3a4d1e74c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according
to a 2022 Duke climate resiliency report</u></a>. The report was meant
to look at the effects of climate change to the Duke system by 2050
under two emissions scenarios outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, one assuming emissions start falling by 2040, the other
assuming continued (some might say
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00177-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>unrealistically</u></a>)
high emissions.
</p>
<p>
Under the extreme scenario, the “overall vulnerability priority of Duke
Energy substations to climate-driven changes in precipitation and inland
flooding is high,” the report said, while under the “middle of the road”
projection, “transmission infrastructure faces a medium priority
vulnerability.”
<a href="https://www.duke-energy.com/-/media/pdfs/our-company/carolinasresiliencetransmissiondistributionstudy.pdf?rev=035db100f60b4c6a8b81e5a3a4d1e74c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>In
both cases, however</u></a>, “without adaptation planning … substations
are at the highest potential risk, with extreme heat and flooding being
the greatest concerns for existing assets.”
</p>
<p>
Duke said at the time that it had “implemented permanent flood
protection measures at new substations located in flood plains and
substations with a prior history of flooding.” For its existing fleet,
priority was being given to those substations considered particularly
“at-risk,” however the flood protection plan had “not yet been
universally implemented at all existing substations in the flood plain.”
</p>
<p>
“What they characterized there falls significantly short of what we just
saw,” Norris said. While he noted that Duke had listed risk to
substations from inland flooding as high (albeit only under the extreme
scenario), it had listed the risk to the distribution of power,
i.e. poles and wires, as “low” under both scenarios. “There’s been a
dramatic misestimate of risk here,” Norris said.
</p>
<p>
For Duke customers, especially in the more isolated parts of Western
North Carolina, they may simply have to wait for workers and parts to
arrive. Repairs that could normally happen quickly will likely happen
slowly as workers struggle to reach areas whose roads have been washed
away. Duke said that it’s now focusing on restoring the “backbone” of
the transmission and distribution system, and then is moving on to
restoring fallen poles in less densely populated areas.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>And it will likely happen again. Kern noted that inland
flooding especially is notoriously hard to predict compared to coastal
flooding from hurricanes. “Flooding is so idiosyncratic,” he said. “It’s
hard for anyone to predict how flooding will affect a region. Let alone
electric utilities.”

<h2 id="new-book-says-trump-secretly-sent-covid-tests-to-putin">New book
says Trump secretly sent COVID tests to Putin</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Then-president Donald Trump secretly sent COVID test
kits to Vladimir Putin despite a U.S. shortage during the pandemic, and
spoke multiple times with the Russian leader after leaving office, says
an explosive new book by Bob Woodward. </p>
<p>The upcoming opus, War, also chronicles some of President Joe Biden’s
own acknowledged missteps and his struggle to prevent escalation of
conflict in the Middle East, including exasperation with Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu over futile efforts to get Israel and Hamas to reach
a cease-fire. </p>
<p>In excerpts published Tuesday by The Washington Post, where he is an
associate editor, Woodward lays out damning details and actions by
Trump, who the writer says has retained a personal relationship with
Putin even as Trump campaigns for another presidential term and the
Russian president conducts a war against Ukraine, a U.S. ally. </p>
<p>With the coronavirus ravaging the world in 2020, Trump sent a batch
of test kits to his counterpart in Moscow. Putin accepted the supplies
but sought to avoid political fallout for Trump, urging that he not
reveal the dispatch of medical equipment, this book says. </p>
<p>According to Woodward, Putin told Trump: “I don’t want you to tell
anybody because people will get mad at you, not me.” </p>
<p>Woodward also cites an unnamed Trump aide in the book who indicated
the Republican flag bearer may have spoken to Putin up to seven times
since leaving the White House in 2021.  </p>
<p>The Post, reporting Woodward’s account, said that at one point in
early 2024, Trump ordered an aide out of his office in his Mar-a-Lago
residence in Florida so he could hold a private call with Putin. </p>
<p>War is set for publication on Oct. 15, just three weeks before a
critical U.S. election in which Trump is locked in a tight race against
Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. </p>
<p>While Harris does make appearances in the book, she is seen in a
supporting role to Biden “and hardly determining foreign policy
herself,” the Post reported. </p>
<p>Woodward has chronicled American presidencies for 50 years, and this
is his fourth book since Trump’s upset victory in 2016. He began his
presidential reportages with Richard Nixon, who was undone by the 1970s
Watergate scandal exposed by Woodward and Post colleague Carl
Bernstein. </p>
<p>Woodward concluded that Trump’s interactions, detailed in the book,
with an authoritarian president at war with a U.S. ally make him more
unfit to be president than Nixon. </p>
<p>“Trump was the most reckless and impulsive president in American
history and is demonstrating the very same character as a presidential
candidate in 2024,” Woodward wrote. </p>
<p>The Trump campaign blasted the book as “trash” and “made up
stories.” </p>
<p>They are “the work of a truly demented and deranged man who suffers
from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome,” campaign
communications director Steven Cheung told AFP. </p>
<p>According to CNN, which obtained a pre-release book copy, Woodward
repeatedly quotes Biden dropping F bombs as he discusses his personal
and political challenges. </p>
<p>Biden called Putin “the epitome of evil,” blasted Netanyahu as a
“liar” and said he “should never have picked” Merrick Garland as U.S.
attorney general. </p>
<p>According to the book, during an April phone call Biden turned testy
with Netanyahu. </p>
<p>“What’s your strategy, man?” Biden asked the Israeli leader,
according to Woodward. </p>
<p>“We have to go into Rafah,” Netanyahu said, referring to a city in
southern Gaza. </p>
<p>“Bibi, you’ve got no strategy,” Biden responded.</p>

<h2 id="us-states-sue-tiktok-saying-it-harms-young-users">US states sue
TikTok, saying it harms young users</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK/WASHINGTON — TikTok faces new lawsuits filed by 13 U.S.
states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday, accusing the popular
social media platform of harming and failing to protect young
people.</p>
<p>The lawsuits, filed separately in New York, California, the District
of Columbia and 11 other states, expand Chinese-owned TikTok’s legal
fight with U.S. regulators and seek new financial penalties against the
company.</p>
<p>Washington is located in the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>The states accuse TikTok of using intentionally addictive software
designed to keep children watching as long and often as possible and
misrepresenting its content moderation effectiveness.</p>
<p>“TikTok cultivates social media addiction to boost corporate
profits,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement.
“TikTok intentionally targets children because they know kids do not yet
have the defenses or capacity to create healthy boundaries around
addictive content.”</p>
<p>TikTok seeks to maximize the amount of time users spend on the app in
order to target them with ads, the states said.</p>
<p>“Young people are struggling with their mental health because of
addictive social media platforms like TikTok,” said New York Attorney
General Letitia James.</p>
<p>TikTok said on Tuesday that it strongly disagreed with the claims,
“many of which we believe to be inaccurate and misleading,” and that it
was disappointed the states chose to sue “rather than work with us on
constructive solutions to industrywide challenges.”</p>
<p>TikTok provides safety features that include default screentime
limits and privacy defaults for minors under 16, the company said.</p>
<p>Washington, D.C., Attorney General Brian Schwalb alleged that TikTok
operates an unlicensed money transmission business through its
livestreaming and virtual currency features.</p>
<p>“TikTok’s platform is dangerous by design. It’s an intentionally
addictive product that is designed to get young people addicted to their
screens,” Schwalb said in an interview.</p>
<p>Washington’s lawsuit accused TikTok of facilitating sexual
exploitation of underage users, saying TikTok’s livestreaming and
virtual currency “operate like a virtual strip club with no age
restrictions.”</p>
<p>Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New
Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Vermont and Washington
state also sued on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In March 2022, eight states, including California and Massachusetts,
said they launched a nationwide probe of TikTok impacts on young
people.</p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department sued TikTok in August for allegedly
failing to protect children’s privacy on the app. Other states,
including Utah and Texas, previously sued TikTok for failing to protect
children from harm. TikTok on Monday rejected the allegations in a court
filing.</p>
<p>TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, is battling a U.S. law
that could ban the app in the United States.</p>

<h2 id="us-slaps-sanctions-on-sudan-paramilitary-leader">US slaps
sanctions on Sudan paramilitary leader</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States on Tuesday announced sanctions against
a senior leader in war-torn Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for his
role in obtaining weapons for the paramilitary organization.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people have died and millions have been
displaced since war broke out in April 2023 between Sudan’s army and the
RSF after their head generals refused a plan to integrate.</p>
<p>Algoney Hamdan Daglo Musa was sanctioned “for his involvement in RSF
efforts to procure weapons and other military materiel that have enabled
the RSF’s ongoing operations in Sudan,” State Department spokesman
Matthew Miller said in a statement.</p>
<p>His actions have fueled war in Sudan “and brutal RSF atrocities
against civilians, which have included war crimes, crimes against
humanity, and ethnic cleansing,” Miller said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury said that as a result of such sanctions “all
property and interests in property of the designated persons… that are
in the United States or in the possession or control of US persons are
blocked and must be reported.”</p>
<p>The United States has led diplomatic efforts to stop the fighting in
Sudan but has seen limited success and leverage, with RSF commanders
unlikely to hold major assets in the West that would be affected by
sanctions.</p>

postpones trip to Germany and Angola because of Hurricane Milton</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden is postponing a planned trip to
Germany and Angola to remain at the White House to monitor Hurricane
Milton, which is bearing down on Florida’s Gulf Coast, the White House
announced on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the change was necessary
“given the projected trajectory and strength” of the storm.</p>
<p>It was not clear when the trip might be rescheduled. Biden had
promised to go to Africa during his term in office, which ends in
January.</p>
<p>Hurricane Milton weakened slightly Tuesday but remained a ferocious
storm that could land a once-in-a-century direct hit on the populous
Tampa Bay region with towering storm surges and turn debris from
Helene’s devastation 12 days ago into projectiles.</p>
<p>Most of Florida’s west coast was under a hurricane or tropical storm
warning as the storm and its 145 mph (230 kph) winds spun just off
Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula, creeping toward the state. With the storm
expected to remain fairly strong as it crosses Florida, parts of the
eastern coast were put under hurricane warnings early Tuesday. Milton’s
center could come ashore Wednesday night in the Tampa Bay area, which
has a population of more than 3.3 million people.</p>

<h2 id="blinken-heads-to-laos-for-asean-and-east-asia-summit">Blinken
heads to Laos for ASEAN and East Asia Summit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to
visit Vientiane, Laos, later this week for meetings with the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, where he is expected to engage
directly with newly elected leaders from the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>Blinken will represent President Joe Biden at this year’s ASEAN-U.S.
Summit and participate in the East Asia Summit, where leaders and senior
officials from India, Japan, South Korea, and the People’s Republic of
China are also expected to attend.</p>
<p>The State Department said Blinken will discuss geopolitical issues
during his talks in Vientiane, including the ongoing crisis in Myanmar,
which is also called Burma, and the importance of upholding
international law in the South China Sea, and Russia’s aggression
against Ukraine.  </p>
<p>As the Burmese junta prepares for an election next year amid
widespread conflict across much of the country, a senior State
Department official told VOA that elections should not take place prior
to genuine peace and reconciliation. </p>
<p>“We remain deeply concerned by the regime’s stated plans to hold
elections, because any elections under current conditions would stand no
chance of expressing the will of the people of Burma,” Daniel
Kritenbrink, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific
affairs, told VOA during a phone briefing on Tuesday. </p>
<p>He added, the U.S. fears that “premature elections” under current
conditions “would likely only generate more violence and prolong the
ongoing crisis” in Myanmar.  </p>
<p>This week’s ASEAN summits will feature the debut of Paetongtarn
Shinawatra, 38, who became Thailand’s prime minister in mid-August. She
will make her first bilateral visit to Laos on Tuesday and will be the
youngest Southeast Asian leader at the summit.</p>
<p>Singapore has also seen a generational shift with Lawrence Wong
succeeding longtime Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in May.</p>
<p>Japan’s new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba took office on October 1.
He has pledged to strengthen his country’s alliance with the U.S. during
a call with President Biden last Wednesday.</p>
<p>“I am grateful for the prime minister’s commitment to the U.S.-Japan
Alliance and look forward to working with his government to reinforce
the enduring partnership between our two nations,” Blinken said in a
statement last week.</p>
<p>Ishiba is also in discussions with South Korean President Yoon Suk
Yeol about holding a meeting on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit.</p>
<p>Regional security, development and trade — including the creation of
resilient semiconductor supply chains — are expected to be top
priorities on the U.S. agenda.</p>
<p>In 2023, total two-way merchandise trade between the United States
and ASEAN reached $395.9 billion, making the U.S. the second-largest
trading partner after China. Additionally, the U.S. is ASEAN’s largest
source of foreign direct investment, which amounted to $74.3 billion
last year.</p>
<p>Susannah Patton, director of the Southeast Asia Program at the
Sydney-based think tank Lowy Institute, said that this year’s East Asia
Summit must address contentious global issues such as the conflict in
the Middle East and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The East Asia Summit comprises ASEAN’s 10 member countries and eight
major dialogue partners, including the United States, China typically
represented by Premier Li Qiang, and Russia represented by Foreign
Minister Sergey Lavrov.</p>
<p>In a recent analysis published by the Lowy Institute, Patton noted
that it is likely that the “ASEAN show will come to Laos and then roll
on again,” adding that “concrete progress on pressing issues will be
sorely lacking.”</p>
<p>“While the EAS is still likely to issue at least one jointly
negotiated statement in 2024,” Patton wrote, “it is a reflection of
global political polarization that ASEAN’s dialogue partners are no
longer able to propose their own dueling statements to advance their
preferred language on international issues.”</p>

Hurricane Milton has horrified meteorologists with its swift
transformation into a monster system, exploding from a Category 1 storm
into a Category 5 storm in about 18 hours. As of this morning it has
maximum sustained winds of 155 mph,

to</a> the National Hurricane Center, and is expected to make landfall
near Tampa, Florida, overnight on Wednesday. Milton will likely weaken
slightly as it approaches the Sunshine State but will nonetheless bring
life-threatening wind, rain, and storm surge to an area still in tatters
from last month’s Hurricane Helene. “If Milton stays on its course this
will be the most powerful hurricane to hit Tampa Bay in over 100 years,”

The Federal Emergency Management Agency is under strain from

Helene’s. Staff shortages are compounding funding shortfalls, with just
9% of FEMA workers available to respond to disasters as of Monday, as
personnel struggle to address a number of recent disasters in other
parts of the country. “The agency is simultaneously supporting over 100
major disaster declarations,” Brock Long, who led FEMA during the Trump

id="china-is-oversupplying-lithium-to-eliminate-rivals-us-official-says">China
is oversupplying lithium to eliminate rivals, US official says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LISBON — Chinese lithium producers are flooding the global market
with the critical metal and causing a “predatory” price drop as they
seek to eliminate competing projects, a senior U.S. official said on a
visit to Portugal that has ample lithium reserves.</p>
<p>Jose Fernandez, undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the
environment at the U.S. Department of State, told a briefing late on
Monday that China was producing much more lithium “than the world needs
today, by far.”</p>
<p>“That is an intentional response by the People’s Republic of China to
what we are trying to do” with the Inflation Reduction Act - the largest
climate and energy investment package in U.S. history valued at over
$400 billion, Fernandez said.</p>
<p>“They engage in predatory pricing… [they] lower the price until
competition disappears,’’ Fernandez said. ’’That is what is
happening.”</p>
<p>China accounts for about two-thirds of the world’s lithium chemical
output, which is mainly used in battery technologies including for
electric cars. Prices of lithium have fallen more than 80% in the past
year largely due to overproduction from China and a drop in demand for
electric vehicles.</p>
<p>However, the price collapse is also affecting China as it has forced
Chinese companies like battery giant CATL to suspend production at
certain mines.</p>
<p>Job cuts</p>
<p>Europe aims to reduce its dependence on imports from China and other
countries of lithium and other materials essential to the green
transition.</p>
<p>Fernandez said the low price “constrains our ability to diversify our
supply chains on a broad, global scale” and also hurts countries such as
Portugal that need investment to develop these industries.</p>
<p>Falling prices have forced many global lithium producers to scale
back production and cut jobs.</p>
<p>Portugal, with some 60,000 tons of known reserves, is already
Europe’s biggest producer of lithium, traditionally mined for
ceramics.</p>
<p>Along with neighboring Spain, the country wants to take advantage of
local lithium deposits, aiming to cover the entire value chain from
mining and refining to cell and battery manufacturing to battery
recycling.</p>
<p>Several mining companies in Portugal have been looking for financing,
customers and suppliers to crank up projects.</p>
<p>“We want to help them, and we think we can… lithium mining companies,
everywhere, have to survive this difficult phase that was created by
predatory pricing,” Fernandez said.</p>
<p>China’s Premier Li Qiang in June used his address at a World Economic
Forum meeting in Dalian to hit back at accusations from the United
States and E.U. that Chinese firms benefit from unfair subsidies and are
poised to flood their markets with cheap green technologies.</p>
<p>Trade tensions intensified last Friday when the European Union said
it would press ahead with hefty tariffs on China-made electric vehicles
to counter what it sees as unfair Chinese subsidies, after a year-long
anti-subsidy investigation. China on Tuesday imposed temporary
anti-dumping measures on imports of brandy from the E.U.</p>

Raises $12 Million to Unlock New Sources of Lithium</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mzc3NjgxNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4MjMyOTk5OH0.exGku9nm_j6mce4_sNIyc8Cn-Otl-VU_sff6sqpwwuE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
With the markets for electric vehicles and battery energy storage
systems on the come-up, energy market analysts predict that the world is
hurtling towards a global lithium shortage by the 2030’s. Lithios, a
Massachusetts-based startup with a novel method of lithium extraction,
is aiming to help by unlocking previously untapped lithium resources
around the world.
</p>
<p>
The company just raised a $12 million seed round to help fund this
mission, led by Clean Energy Ventures with support from Lowercarbon
Capital, among others. The round included $10 million in venture funding
and $2 million in venture debt loans from Silicon Valley Bank.
</p>
<p>
It’s not as if the world actually lacks for lithium, the energy dense
mineral that is the primary component in lithium-ion batteries. It’s
just that many current reserves are too low-grade to be economically
exploited, and traditional extraction methods are land-intensive,
inefficient, and often controversial with local communities. Chile,
Australia, and China dominate the market, while the U.S. contributes
less than 2% of the world’s annual supply.
</p>
<p>
Lithios aims to make it more economical and environmentally friendly to
extract lithium from salty groundwater deposits, a.k.a. brines. The
company’s CEO, Mo Alkhadra, told me that while about two-thirds of the
world’s lithium is contained in brine rather than hard rock, only about
15% to 20% of these brines are currently worth mining. Lithios, he said,
will get that number up to around 80% to 85%, in theory. “The vision
with Lithios’ tech is to enable access to these lower-grade resources at
a similar or maybe slightly higher cost structure relative to the
highest grade deposits that are mined today,” Alkhadra explained.
</p>
<p>
The normal lithium brine extraction process involves pumping saline
water from underground reservoirs to the surface, where it’s then moved
through a series of
<a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/144393/where-batteries-begin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>large,
wildly colored evaporation ponds</u></a>, often located in the middle of
vast salt deserts. Over a period of about 18 months, the sun slowly
evaporates the brine, leaving behind increasingly high concentrations of
lithium. But Lithios’ tech avoids these ponds altogether. Instead, the
brine is pumped to the surface and delivered directly to the company’s
refrigerator-sized electrochemical reactors, which contain stacks of
electrodes that capture the lithium.
</p>
<p>
While the company wouldn’t disclose the electrodes’ exact chemistry,
Alkhadra told me they are made from “inorganic compounds which have
geometries that fit basically only lithium and none of the other larger
ions that you would find in these brine mixtures.” After lithium is
extracted, the company produces a purified lithium concentrate and sends
that off for refining into battery chemicals. The final batteries could
end up in EVs, energy storage systems, or even just plain old portable
consumer electronics.
</p>
<p>
Lithios’ tech comes at a good time, as the Inflation Reduction Act’s
domestic content requirements for EVs incentivizes manufacturers to
source critical minerals from the U.S. and countries that the U.S. has
free trade agreements with. Alkhadra told me that Lithios could open up
opportunities for brine mining in the Smackover formation, which spans a
number of southern states including Texas and Arkansas,
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/04/the-salton-sea-could-produce-the-worlds-greenest-lithium.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Salton Sea area</u></a>, which has been dubbed “Lithium Valley,” as well
as deposits in Utah and Nevada. More areas in Canada and Europe could
also be in play. (The company said it couldn’t talk yet about any
specific partnership agreements.)
</p>
<p>
While there are a number of other companies such as
<a href="https://lilacsolutions.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Lilac
Solutions</u></a> and
<a href="https://energyx.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>EnergyX</u></a>
that are also pursuing more efficient and less land-intensive
brine-based extraction methods, they rely on a different, purely
chemical process known as direct lithium extraction, which uses
technology adapted from the water treatment industry. “The core thesis
around what we’re building at Lithios stems from that work,” Alkhadra
told me, explaining that electrifying these chemical processes makes
them “much more selective, energy efficient, and water efficient” —
resulting in “modest to significant cost reduction.”
</p>
<p>
Lithios’ new funding will help the company scale its research and
development efforts as well as build out a pilot facility in Medford,
Massachusetts, with initial production to begin in the first quarter of
next year. At first, output will be limited to just “several battery
packs” per year, Alkhadra told me, scaling up to commercial production
“in the coming years.”
</p>
<p>
Alkhadra is excited to see investors and the federal government alike
beginning to express interest in the upstream, “dirtier” portions of the
battery supply chain, which he told me have generally been overlooked in
favor of downstream sectors such as battery manufacturing and cell
production. “I think the U.S. departments of both energy and defense,
and investors too, are coming to realize that the real bottlenecks in
battery manufacturing and EV production are on the resource side.”

<h2 id="milton-could-strike-florida-wednesday">Milton could strike
Florida Wednesday</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>FORT MYERS BEACH, Fla. — Florida’s Gulf Coast braced Tuesday for the
impact of Hurricane Milton’s near-record winds and expected massive
storm surge, which could bring destruction to areas already reeling from
Helene’s devastation 12 days ago and still recovering from Ian’s wrath
two years ago.</p>
<p>Almost the entirety of Florida’s west coast was under a hurricane
warning early Tuesday as the Category 5 storm and its 265 kph winds
crept toward the state at 14 kph, sucking energy from the Gulf of
Mexico’s warm water. The strongest Atlantic hurricane on record is
1980’s Allen, which reached wind speeds of 306 kph as it moved through
the Caribbean and Gulf before striking Texas and Mexico.</p>
<p>Milton’s center could come ashore Wednesday in the Tampa Bay region,
which has not endured a direct hit by a major hurricane in more than a
century. Scientists expect the system to weaken slightly before
landfall, though it could retain hurricane strength as it churns across
central Florida toward the Atlantic Ocean. That would largely spare
other states ravaged by Helene, which killed at least 230 people on its
path from Florida to the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>Tampa Bay has not been hit directly by a major hurricane since 1921,
and authorities fear luck is about to run out for the region and its 3.3
million residents. President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration
for Florida, and U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor said 7,000 federal workers were
mobilized to help in one of the largest mobilizations of federal
personnel in history.</p>
<p>“This is the real deal here with Milton,” Tampa Mayor Jane Castor
told a Monday news conference. “If you want to take on Mother Nature,
she wins 100% of the time.”</p>
<p>The Tampa Bay area is still rebounding from Helene and its powerful
surge — a wall of water up to 2.4 meters it created even though its eye
was 160 kilometers offshore. Twelve people died there, with the worst
damage along a string of barrier islands from St. Petersburg to
Clearwater.</p>
<p>Forecasters warned that Milton could bring a possible 2.4- to
3.6-meter storm surge, leading to evacuation orders being issued for
beach communities all along the Gulf coast. In Florida, that means
anyone who stays is on their own and first responders are not expected
to risk their lives to rescue them at the height of the storm.</p>
<p>Stragglers were a problem during Helene and 2022’s Ian. Many
residents failed to heed ample warnings, saying they evacuated during
previous storms only to have major surges not materialize. But there was
evidence Monday that people were getting out before Milton arrives.</p>
<p>A steady stream of vehicles headed north toward the Florida Panhandle
on Interstate 75, the main highway on the west side of the peninsula, as
residents heeded evacuation orders. Traffic clogged the southbound lanes
of the highway for miles as other residents headed for the relative
safety of Fort Lauderdale and Miami on the other side of the state.</p>
<p>About 240 kilometers south of Tampa, Fort Myers Beach was nearly a
ghost town by Monday afternoon as an evacuation order took effect. Ian
devastated the 5,000-resident community two years ago, its 4.5-meter
storm surge destroying or severely damaging 400 homes and businesses.
Fourteen people died there as they tried to ride out the storm, and
dozens had to be rescued.</p>
<p>On Monday, the few residents who could be found were racing against
the clock to safeguard their buildings and belongings. None said they
were staying.</p>
<p>The signs of Ian’s devastation remain visible everywhere. Rebuilt
homes stand next to others in various states of construction. There are
numerous vacant lots, which were once rare.</p>
<p>“This whole street used to be filled out with houses,” said Mike
Sandell, owner of Pool-Rific Services. His workers were removing and
storing pumps and heaters Monday from his clients’ pools so they
wouldn’t get destroyed.</p>
<p>Home construction supplies like bricks, piping and even workers’
outhouses lined the streets, potential projectiles that could do further
damage if a surge hits.</p>
<p>At the beach Monday afternoon, workers busily emptied the triple-wide
trailer that houses The Goodz, a combined hardware, convenience, fishing
supply, ice cream and beach goods store. Owner Graham Belger said he
moved his “Your Island Everything Store” into the trailer after Ian
destroyed his permanent building across the street.</p>
<p>“We’ll rebuild, but it is going to be bad,” he said.</p>
<p>Nearby, Don Girard and his son Dominic worked to batten down the
family’s three-story combination rental and vacation home that’s about
30.5 meters from the water. It’s first-floor garage and entranceway were
flooded by Helene last month, Hurricane Debby in August, and a tide
brought by a recent supermoon.</p>
<p>Ian was by far the worst. Its waves crashed into the 14-year-old
home’s second floor, destroying the flooring. Girard repaired the
damage, and his aqua-blue and white home stands in contrast to the
older, single-story house across the street. It was submerged by Ian,
never repaired and remains vacant. Its once-off-white walls are now
tinged with brown. Plywood covers the holes that once contained windows
and doors.</p>
<p>Girard, who owns a banner and flag company in Texas, said that while
his feelings about owning his home are mostly positive, they are
becoming mixed. He said every December, his extended family gathers
there for the holidays. At that time of year, temperatures in southwest
Florida are usually in the low 20s Celsius with little rain or humidity.
The area and its beaches fill with tourists.</p>
<p>“At Christmas, there is no better place in the world,” Girard
said.</p>
<p>But flooding from Ian, the other storms and now Milton is leaving him
frustrated.</p>
<p>“It’s been difficult, I’m not going to lie to you,” Girard said. “The
last couple years have been pretty bad.”</p>

<h2 id="us-warns-voters-of-disinformation-deluge">US warns voters of
disinformation deluge</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — American voters are likely about to be swamped by a
flood of misinformation and influence campaigns engineered by U.S.
adversaries aiming, according to senior U.S. intelligence officials, to
sway the results of the upcoming presidential election and cast doubt on
the process itself.</p>
<p>The latest assessment from the Office of the Director of National
Intelligence, issued Monday, comes just 29 days before the November 5
election that will see U.S. voters choose the country’s next president
and cast ballots in hundreds of other state and local races. </p>
<p>“We’ve continued to see actors ramp up their activities as we get
closer to Election Day,” said a senior U.S. intelligence official,
briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>“They recognize that individuals are already voting, and operations
can have a greater impact as we get closer to Election Day,” the
official said, noting that the election itself may just be a starting
point.</p>
<p>“The intelligence community expects foreign influence actors to
continue their campaigns by calling into question the validity of the
election results after the polls close,” the official added.</p>
<p>A second U.S. intelligence official warned the pace of such influence
efforts, especially those targeting specific races or political
campaigns, has also picked up.</p>
<p>“We have had more than a threefold increase,” the official said,
explaining that the number of private briefings to candidates and
campaigns has likewise jumped.</p>
<p>Intelligence agencies also cautioned that U.S. adversaries will
likely seize upon the damage done by Hurricane Helene and potential
damage from Hurricane Milton as it strengthens off the U.S. coastline to
further amplify and manufacture narratives meant to undermine confidence
in the election results.</p>
<p>“It does take time for those types of narratives to be formed and put
out into the wild, so to speak,” the first intelligence official said.
“But we certainly expect foreign countries to take advantage of such
situations and promote further divisive rhetoric.”</p>
<p>Monday’s assessment follows a series of earlier public warnings about
foreign efforts to meddle in the U.S. election.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said Monday that Russia, Iran and China continue to be
responsible for most of the influence efforts targeting U.S. voters.</p>
<p>And, they said, there have been no indications that any of those
countries have changed their goals. </p>
<p>Russia, they said, continues to run influence campaigns aimed at
boosting the chances of former U.S. President and Republican
presidential nominee Donald Trump, while seeking to hurt the campaign of
Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee.</p>
<p>Iran’s efforts remain focused on helping Harris by hurting Trump,
they said, pointing to the ongoing hack-and-leak operation against the
Trump campaign, which has been traced to three operatives working for
Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.</p>
<p>Targeting state, local races</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence agencies assess that China has yet to wade into the
U.S. presidential campaign, focusing instead on persuading American
voters to reject state and local candidates perceived as detrimental to
Beijing’s interests, especially those voicing support for Taiwan. </p>
<p>But the latest public assessment pointed to some changes.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence officials on Monday warned that Russia and Cuba
have joined China, in targeting congressional, state and local
races.</p>
<p>“Moscow is leveraging a wide range of influence actors in an effort
to influence congressional races, particularly to encourage the U.S.
public to oppose pro-Ukraine policies and politicians,” the intelligence
official said.</p>
<p>“Havana almost certainly has considered influence efforts targeting
some candidates,” the official added. “This is consistent with what
they’ve done in past cycles.”</p>
<p>Russia, China and Iran have all rejected previous U.S. accusations of
election meddling. Russia, Iran and Cuba have yet to respond to requests
from VOA for comment on the latest U.S. findings.</p>
<p>China late Monday again dismissed the U.S. concerns.</p>
<p>“China is not interested in the U.S. congressional election, and we
have no intention and will not interfere in it,” Liu Pengyu, the
spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA in an
email.</p>
<p>“Some U.S. congressmen stick to their wrong positions on the Taiwan
question,” Liu added. “China firmly defends its national sovereignty and
territorial integrity, but this does not lead to the conclusion that
China has interfered in the congressional elections.”</p>
<p>But the U.S. intelligence assessments align with concerns voiced by
some lawmakers and private technology companies.</p>
<p>“The 48 hours after the polls close, especially if we have as close
an election as we anticipate, could be equally if not more significant
in terms of spreading false information, disinformation and literally
undermining the tenets of our democracy,” Mark Warner, chair of the
Senate Intelligence Committee, said during a hearing last month.</p>
<p>‘Vigorous activity’ </p>
<p>Microsoft President Brad Smith, who has warned that the most perilous
moments could come in the 48 hours before the U.S. election, separately
said the increase in malign cyber efforts by Russia and Iran,
especially, is undeniable.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing vigorous activity,” Smith told a cyber conference last
month. “We’re seeing the Iranians really target the Republican Party in
the Trump campaign,” he said. “We’re seeing the Russians target the
Democratic Party and now the Harris campaign.”</p>
<p>And it is unclear what impact the U.S. has made with its attempts to
counter the growing number of foreign influence efforts.</p>
<p>Last month, the U.S. Justice Department seized 32 internet domains
used by companies linked to Moscow to spread disinformation. At the same
time, the department indicted employees of the state-controlled media
outlet RT in connection with a plot to launder Russian propaganda
through a U.S.-based media company.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence officials on Monday, however, said such tactics are
no longer unique to the Kremlin. </p>
<p>“Foreign influence actors are getting better at hiding their hand and
using Americans to do it,” said one of the U.S. intelligence officials.
“Foreign countries calculate that Americans are more likely to believe
other Americans compared to content with clear signs of foreign
propaganda.”</p>
<p>Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on
Sunday that social media is rife with fake personas generated by U.S.
adversaries.</p>
<p>“If you’re looking at stuff on Twitter, on TikTok, on Facebook, on
Instagram, and it’s political in nature … there is a very reasonable
chance — I would put it in the 20 to 30% range — that the content you
are seeing, the comments you are seeing, are coming from one of those
three countries: Russia, Iran, China,” he said. “It’s not going to stop
on November 5.”</p>

Harris mark somber anniversary of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Former President Donald Trump and Vice
President Kamala Harris are marking the anniversary of the deadliest
attack on Jews since the Holocaust as the presidential candidates
approach the final weeks of the campaign during a widening conflict in
the Middle East.</p>
<p>Political leaders across the spectrum were marking the killing of
about 1,200 people, including 46 U.S. citizens, by Hamas-led militants
in the October 7 attack last year, and the taking of about 250 hostages.
A year later, about 100 people, including several Americans, remain in
captivity, as U.S.-led efforts to negotiate a cease-fire and hostage
release deal have sputtered out.</p>
<p>Trump visited the New York City gravesite of Rabbi Menachem Mendel
Schneerson, who led the Chabad-Lubavitch movement of Orthodox Judaism
from 1951 until his death in 1994. Schneerson was the movement’s seventh
leader, known as Lubavitcher Rebbe. Trump then will speak before Jewish
community leaders at one of his Florida resorts in the Miami suburb of
Doral.</p>
<p>Harris and her husband planted a pomegranate tree on the grounds of
the vice president’s residence in honor of the those killed a year
ago.</p>
<p>Earlier Monday, Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, recited
a prayer for peace at an event to commemorate the anniversary hosted by
the American Jewish Committee in Washington.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden also hosted a somber
memorial ceremony at the White House Monday to mark the anniversary of
the attack. The Bidens looked on as Rabbi Aaron Alexander of
Washington’s Adas Israel Congregation recited the Jewish remembrance
prayer for the more than 1,200 people, including dozens of Americans,
killed that day, listing the towns, villages and festival site that were
the scenes of the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust.</p>
<p>The president then lit a lone memorial candle placed on a small table
at the center of the Blue Room, before they observed a moment of
silence.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Biden spoke with Israeli President Isaac Herzog,
the White House said.</p>
<p>The attack sparked a deadly war in Gaza, as Israel moved to root out
Hamas’ control over the territory and try to return those taken captive.
Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians,
including many women and children, according to the Hamas-run health
ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and
civilians.</p>
<p>Another Iran-backed group, Hezbollah, has fired thousands of rockets
at Israeli territory in the same period from Lebanon, and Israel last
month expanded a campaign of sabotage and assassination and launched a
ground incursion into Lebanon to combat the threat from the group.</p>
<p>In 1997, the U.S. State Department designated both Hezbollah and
Hamas as foreign terrorist organizations. Many other countries also
label them as terrorist groups, although some apply the designation only
to their military wings.</p>
