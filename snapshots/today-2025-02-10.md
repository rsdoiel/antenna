## My time machine runs on technical writing

date: 2025-02-10, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

<p>This past weekend I’ve been experimenting with AI-assisted coding to port basic docs-as-code elements to old operating systems and platforms, such as the venerable Intel 386. While this might strike you as a bizarre display of futility, I find this sort of retrocomputing exercise to be quite beneficial, if not enlightening. Something just clicks when you stop and walk backwards.</p>

## Cerebras brings instant inference to Mistral Le Chat

date: 2025-02-10, updated: 2025-02-10, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://cerebras.ai/blog/mistral-le-chat">Cerebras brings instant inference to Mistral Le Chat</a></strong></p>
Mistral <a href="https://mistral.ai/en/news/all-new-le-chat">announced a major upgrade</a> to their <a href="https://chat.mistral.ai/chat">Le Chat</a> web UI (their version of ChatGPT) a few days ago, and one of the signature features was performance.</p>
<p>It turns out that performance boost comes from hosting their model on Cerebras:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are excited to bring our technology to Mistral – specifically the flagship 123B parameter Mistral Large 2 model. Using our Wafer Scale Engine technology, we achieve over 1,100 tokens per second on text queries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given Cerebras's so far unrivaled inference performance I'm surprised that no other AI lab has formed a partnership like this already.

## Quoting Sam Altman

date: 2025-02-09, updated: 2025-02-09, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<blockquote cite="https://blog.samaltman.com/three-observations"><p><strong>The cost to use a given level of AI falls about 10x every 12 months, and lower prices lead to much more use.</strong> You can see this in the token cost from GPT-4 in early 2023 to GPT-4o in mid-2024, where the price per token dropped about 150x in that time period. Moore’s law changed the world at 2x every 18 months; this is unbelievably stronger.</p></blockquote>

<p>Terrible idea: a website that has all your information being pulled in a banner behind a plane... but the plane only flies by your browser window at certain times of day. You might catch part of the banner or the plane if you pull up the site at the right time. Refresh it over several minutes to see all the details. The rest of the time it's just empty air.</p>
