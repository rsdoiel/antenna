id="nsa-releases-copy-of-internal-lecture-delivered-by-computing-giant-rear-adm.-grace-hopper">NSA
releases copy of internal lecture delivered by computing giant Rear Adm.
Grace Hopper</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>In one of the more unique public proactive transparency record
releases for the National Security Agency (NSA) to date, NSA has
released a digital copy of a lecture that then-Capt. Grace Hopper gave
agency employees on August 19, 1982. The lecture, “Future Possibilities:
Data, Hardware, Software, and People,” features Capt. Hopper discussing
some of the potential future challenges of protecting information. She
also provided valuable insight on leadership and her experiences
breaking barriers in the fields of computer science and mathematics. ↫
NSA press release Digital preservation is about more than just code –
it’s also about invaluable content like this. It seems rather uncouth to
spend only a few lines on who Grace Hopper really is, since it’s your
duty to know already, and she deserves a hell of a lot more than a few
lines. If you don’t yet know who she is, her Wikipedia page is a good
place to start. The speech in question has an interesting history, in
that the only medium on which it was stored were 1-inch AMPEX tapes. The
speech was originally given to NSA employees, but not even the damn NSA
had the ability to access the recordings of the speech, and had to call
in the National Archives and Records Administration’s help. The NARA
managed to retrieve the footage from the tapes, and now here we are.
This will make for some great weekend viewing.</p>

<h2 id="end-of-the-road-an-anandtech-farewell">End of the road: an
AnandTech farewell</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>I hate this timeline. It is with great sadness that I find myself
penning the hardest news post I’ve ever needed to write here at
AnandTech. After over 27 years of covering the wide – and wild – word of
computing hardware, today is AnandTech’s final day of publication. For
better or worse, we’ve reached the end of a long journey – one that
started with a review of an AMD processor, and has ended with the review
of an AMD processor. It’s fittingly poetic, but it is also a testament
to the fact that we’ve spent the last 27 years doing what we love,
covering the chips that are the lifeblood of the computing industry. ↫
Ryan Smith at AnandTech This sudden loss is sending shockwaves through
the industry, and rightfully so. AnandTech is a pillar, a cornerstone of
hardware reporting, and one of the very few – possibly only – tech news
outlet out there with such depth, quality, integrity, and restraint. I
can’t think of any other outlet being as dedicated to proper
benchmarking and hardware reviews as AnandTech was, and losing them is a
huge loss for all of us. The cause is exactly what you’d expect, sadly.
It’s simply not really possible to remain profitable writing in-depth
hardware reviews and benchmarks, as the world has shifted to video, and
advertising income has cratered. There’s tons of hints about AnandTech
not wanting to embrace sensationalism and clickbaiting to increase
revenue – they’d rather go out with class, and I admire and appreciate
that greatly. It just goes to show how hard it is to keep your head
above water in the current online publishing world without rampant
clickbaiting and flashy videos. In a better, less monopolised world,
AnandTech could thrive. Sadly, that’s not the timeline we’re in. As far
as housekeeping goes, the site will remain up for now, but there’s no
guarantee it’ll stay up forever. I’m sure countless people are already
archiving the invaluable content AnandTech has produced over its 27 year
run, including the forums. We shan’t lose what AnandTech has
created.</p>

Western Solar Plan.</a> The idea is to “drive responsible solar
development to locations with fewer potential conflicts while helping
the nation transition to a clean energy economy,” BLM Director Tracy
Stone-Manning said in a statement.
</p>
<p>
To speed up the approval process of solar projects, the Western Solar
Plan identifies 31 million acres of public lands across 11 western
states as available for potential development, singling out regions that
would bring solar “closer to transmission lines or to previously
disturbed lands” and avoid “protected lands, sensitive cultural
resources, and important wildlife habitat,” according to the BLM.
Individual projects would still need to be authorized through
site-specific environmental reviews and public comment periods.

Just over half of Americans (52%) would support a bipartisan law that
made it easier to build new clean energy projects and benefit some oil
and gas development, a new poll by Heatmap has found. “That’s good news
for one of the last remaining pieces of environmental policy that
Congress could pass under this presidency: a bipartisan proposal from
Senators Joe Manchin and John Barrasso that would speed up the process

largely in favor, including 58% of GOP voters, who were a little more
amenable to the compromise than Democrats. “This all suggests that the

continues to debate it through the fall,” adds Meyer. “If you were to
summarize respondents’ reactions to the survey, it might look like,
‘Sure, whatever, sounds good.’”

<p class="drop-caps">
In a warming world where winter snow is melting earlier and rain is
arriving later,
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/culture/the-last-fire-season-manjula-martin" target="_self"><u>wildfire
season</u></a>” has become somewhat of a misnomer. Some parts of the
country now see blazes popping up practically year round. This, combined
with decades of fire management policy that promoted suppression over
natural and controlled burns, has turned certain states — California,
most famously — into tinderboxes.<br/>
</p>
<p>
With wildfire smoke becoming a standard component of Silicon Valley
summers, it’s probably no surprise that numerous data analytics and
artificial intelligence-focused startups have sprung up to address the
issue. There’s even a San Francisco-based venture capital firm,
Convective Capital, devoted solely to funding wildfire solutions.
</p>
<p>
“My big question coming into starting Convective was, are there enough
companies in this category?” Bill Clerico, founder and managing partner
of the firm told me. The answer, he found, was yes. After establishing
Convective Capital in the beginning of 2022, he said, “we’ve identified
about 500 of what we call fire tech companies.” They run the gamut from
startups that work on wildfire suppression to those dealing with
identification, prevention, mitigation, and insurance against damages.
</p>
<p>
Rhizome, a company making an AI-powered wildfire risk mitigation
platform for utilities, is one of the firm’s most recent investments.
“Think of it as Sim City for the grid,” Mishal Thadani, CEO of the
Washington, D.C.-based startup, told me. “You obviously need to know, as
extreme weather events hit, how this is going to affect your assets,” he
explained.
</p>
<p>
Rhizome’s platform gives utilities insight into, “if there is an asset
failure, given the asset type, the type of failure, and the burn
probability given the vegetation makeup and the dryness conditions,
what’s going to be the likelihood of a wildfire ignition?” This
information helps utilities decide where to put their money, whether
that means replacing a power line or pole, insulating conductors,
undergrounding power lines, or trimming back a bush. Last month, Rhizome
announced a $1 million investment from Convective Capital, not tied to a
particular funding round. The company raised
<a href="https://www.rhizomedata.com/news/rhizome-grid-resilience-launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$2.5
million</u></a> in its pre-seed round last year.
</p>
<p>
The problem is not simply a lack of data, Thadani told me — utilities
often know things about their assets such as last inspection date and
outage history, and have systems that can render the surrounding
landscape and other infrastructural features. The problem is that data
is not part of a holistic system that can provide comprehensive
insights. If risk analysis is being performed, Thadani said, “it’s being
done on a super scrappy spreadsheet basis.”
</p>
<p>
Rhizome aims to build the “connective tissue” between a utility’s
disparate data systems, then combine that with other geographic datasets
on climate, weather, and vegetation. From there, the company uses its
machine learning models to assess the likelihood of extreme weather
events and their subsequent impacts. Ultimately, this allows utilities
to provide regulators with more quantifiable information on their plans
to improve grid resiliency and prevent wildfires, beyond just citing a
figure for how much money they want to spend.
</p>
<p>
Utilities are not exactly known for their technical prowess, but are
hungry nevertheless for solutions to their wildfire woes. Pacific Gas
&amp; Electric, the nation’s largest utility, was driven into bankruptcy
after being found liable for a spate of enormous California wildfires in
2017 and 2018. After reemerging from bankruptcy in 2020, it now has a

<a href="https://newsletter.rationalwalk.com/p/berkshire-hathaway-energys-uncertain" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Berkshire

wildfires in their service areas.
</p>
<p>
The most common customers for companies in Convective Capital’s
portfolio are utilities, governments, and insurance companies. “These
are tremendously deep-pocketed institutions, but they are not, you know,
necessarily the most fast-moving or innovative,” he told me. “And so
that is the fundamental challenge of building a wildfire technology
company.”
</p>
<p>
So far, Rhizome has announced partnerships with two utilities, Seattle
City Light and Vermont Electric Power Company. But Clerico acknowledges
that getting traditional institutions onboard is no easy task, even when
the benefits seem clear. The magnitude of the destruction in recent
years <em><em>has</em></em> served as an accelerant, though — something
the vegetation management platform provider AiDash has seen first hand.
Abhishek Singh, cofounder and CEO of the startup (which is not in
Convective’s portfolio), said that when he founded the company in 2019,
“Every investor warned us not to do this because utilities don’t buy and
they won’t invest.” But that’s not what he’s experienced.
</p>
<p>
AiDash
<a href="https://www.aidash.com/news/aidash-closes-its-oversubscribed-series-c-funding-round-at-58-5-million/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>raised
$58.5 million</u></a> in an oversubscribed Series C round earlier this
year, led by the impact investor Lightrock, and has five utility
partnerships, including Southern California Edison’s holding company,
Edison International, as well as Duke Energy. The company uses satellite
data and AI analytics to assess vegetation near utility infrastructure
for wildfire risk. It can also detect faults by fusing satellite data
with other sources such as thermal or LiDAR-based imagery. (Convective
Capital sees the value proposition in using satellites for vegetation
management, too — it’s invested in one of AiDash’s direct competitors,
an Amsterdam-based startup called Overstory.)
</p>
<p>
When Singh founded AiDash in 2019, both the size and cost of satellites
were plummeting, leading to far more launches and thus far more data. .
“Since the history of the first satellite until 2018, there were
2,200-odd satellites launched,” he told me. “From 2019 onwards, each
year close to 1,000 satellites are getting launched.” The company
purchases mounds of that data to conduct its vegetation analyses.
</p>
<p>
Vegetation management is typically the largest line item in a utility’s
operations and maintenance budgets, Singh told me, costing the entire
sector around $6 billion or $7 billion annually. “It’s also the single
largest cause of utility-caused wildfires, as well as the cause of most
outages,” he said, as power lines coming into contact with trees,
grasses, and shrubs can easily spark a fire. Anything that can help them
trim that budget and preempt the need for costly equipment repairs is
worth a lot. “These are all million dollar contracts,” Singh told me.
</p>
<p>
But big data platforms alone are just one tool in the vast toolbox that
comprises a holistic approach to wildfire management. “There’s no
panacea, where you just do one thing and then it solves the problem,”
Clerico told me. “It’s going to get solved as a combination of
consistent and repeated forest management, building towns and cities
that are fire adapted, building great infrastructure, and then having
the ability to detect and respond quickly. All of these things are huge,
multi decade, multi billion dollar investments.”
</p>
<p>
So for the foreseeable future, Convective Capital will have its work cut
out for it. But when I asked Clerico if one day, in a beautiful, far-off
dreamland, there might not be the need for a dedicated wildfire tech VC,
he said he hopes so.

<p>PANAMA CITY — Panamanian authorities deported a group of migrants to
Ecuador on a second flight financed by the United States, as part of an
agreement between the U.S. and Panama to discourage irregular crossings
and reduce the flow of mostly U.S.-bound migration.</p>
<p>The flight carrying 30 Ecuadoreans departed on Thursday evening en
route to the coastal city of Manta, Ecuador, Panama’s migration service
said, adding the migrants were deported for evading a migration
checkpoint on the popular Darien Gap route.</p>
<p>Thousands of people every year cross the dangerous Darien Gap jungle
on Panama’s border with Colombia on the way to the United States.</p>
<p>The flight on Thursday followed a maiden journey financed by
Washington in mid-August, which returned around 30 migrants to
Colombia.</p>
<p>The latest deportation comes days after Panama’s President Jose
Mulino announced return flights for Indian migrants in September and for
Chinese citizens on an unspecified date.</p>

nonprofit reclaims centuries-old cemetery for enslaved people</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>KINGSTON, New York — On a residential block in upstate New York,
college students dug and sifted backyard dirt as part of an
archeological exploration this summer of a centuries-old cemetery for
African Americans.</p>
<p>Now covered with green lawns in the city of Kingston, this spot in
1750 was part of a burial ground for people who were enslaved. It was
located on what was then the outskirts of town. An unknown number of
people who were denied church burials were interred here until the late
19th century, when the cemetery was covered over as the city grew.</p>
<p>The site is now being reclaimed as the Pine Street African Burial
Ground, one of many forgotten or neglected cemeteries for African
Americans getting fresh attention. In the last three summers, the
remains of up to 27 people have been located here.</p>
<p>Advocates in this Hudson River city purchased a residential property
covering about half the old cemetery several years ago and now use the
house there as a visitor center. Money is being raised to turn the urban
backyard into a respectful resting place. And while the names of people
buried here may be lost, tests are planned on their remains to shed
light on their lives and identify their descendants.</p>
<p>“The hardships of those buried here cannot just go down in vain,”
said Tyrone Wilson, founder of Harambee Kingston, the nonprofit
community group behind the project. “We have a responsibility to make
sure that we fix that disrespect.”</p>
<p>While the more-than-0.2 hectares site was designated as a cemetery
for people who were enslaved in 1750, it might have been in use before
then. Burials continued through about 1878, more than 50 years after New
York fully abolished slavery. Researchers say people were buried with
their feet to the east, so when they rise on Judgment Day they would
face the rising sun.</p>
<p>Remains found on the Harambee property are covered with patterned
African cloths and kept where they are. Remains found on adjoining land
are exhumed for later burial on the Harambee property.</p>
<p>Students from the State University of New York at New Paltz recently
finished a third summer of supervised backyard excavations in this city
129 kilometers upriver from Manhattan. The students get course credit,
though anthropology major Maddy Thomas said there’s an overriding sense
of mission.</p>
<p>“I don’t like when people feel upset or forgotten,” Thomas said on a
break. “And that is what’s happened here. So we’ve got to fix it.”</p>
<p>Harambee is trying to raise $1 million to transform the modest
backyard into resting spot that reflects the African heritage of the
people buried there. Plans include a tall marker in the middle of the
yard.</p>
<p>While some graves were apparently marked, it’s still hard to say who
was buried there.</p>
<p>“Some of them, it’s obvious, were marked with just a stone with no
writing on it,” said Joseph Diamond, associate professor of anthropology
at New Paltz.</p>
<p>The only intact headstone recovered with a name visible was for
Caezar Smith, who was born enslaved and died a free man in 1839 at age
41. A researcher mined historical records and came up with two more
people potentially buried there in 1803: a man identified as Sam and a
16-year-old girl named Deyon who was publicly hanged after being
convicted of murdering the 6-year-old daughter of her enslavers.</p>
<p>The cemetery was at first covered by a lumberyard by 1880, even
though some gravestones were apparently still standing by that date.</p>
<p>In 1990, Diamond was doing an archaeological survey for the city and
noticed the cemetery was marked on a map from 1870. He and the city
historian went out to find it.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, Pine Street building owner Andrew Kirschner had just
discovered buried bone chips while digging in front of the building in
search of a sewer pipe. He put the pieces in a box. Kirschner said he
was still digging when Diamond told him what they were looking for.</p>
<p>“The conversation begins and then I go, ‘Well, let me show you what I
found.’ Of course, they were amazed,” said Kirschner, who had owned the
building next to the current Harambee property.</p>
<p>Even after the discovery, Diamond said it was difficult to convince
people there were graves on Pine Street. There were even plans in 1996
to build a parking lot over much of the site. Advocates purchased the
property in 2019.</p>
<p>Similar stories of disregard and rediscovery have played out
elsewhere.</p>
<p>In Manhattan, the African Burial Ground National Monument marks the
site where an estimated 15,000 free and enslaved Africans were buried
until the 1790s. It was discovered in 1991 during excavations for a
federal building. Farther up the Hudson River, the renovation in
Newburgh of a century-old school into a courthouse in 2008 led to the
discovery of more than 100 sets of remains.</p>
<p>Antoinette Jackson, founder of The Black Cemetery Network, said many
of the 169 sites listed in their online archive had been erased.</p>
<p>“A good deal of them represent sites that have been built over — by
parking lots, schools, stadiums, highways. Others have been
under-resourced,” said Jackson, a professor of anthropology at the
University of Southern Florida.</p>
<p>She added that the cemeteries listed on the archive are just the “tip
of the iceberg.”</p>
<p>Given the meager historical record in Kingston, advocates hope tests
on the remains will help fill in some gaps. Isotopic analyses could
provide information on whether individuals grew up elsewhere — like
South Carolina or Africa — and then moved to the region. DNA analyses
could provide information on where in Africa their ancestors came from.
The DNA tests also might be able to link them to living descendants.</p>
<p>Wilson said local families have committed to providing DNA samples.
He sees the tests as another way to connect people to heritage.</p>
<p>“One of the biggest issues that we have in African culture is that we
don’t know our history,” he said. “We don’t have a lot of information of
who we are.”</p>

<h2 id="trump-asks-federal-court-to-intervene-in-hush-money-case">Trump
asks federal court to intervene in hush money case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — Donald Trump asked a federal court late Thursday to
intervene in his New York hush money criminal case, seeking a pathway to
overturn his felony conviction and indefinitely delay his sentencing
scheduled for next month.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the former president and current Republican nominee asked
the federal court in Manhattan to seize the case from the state court
where it was brought and tried, arguing that the historic prosecution
violated Trump’s constitutional rights and ran afoul of the U.S. Supreme
Court’s recent ruling on presidential immunity.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers said moving the case to federal court following his
May 30 conviction will give him an “unbiased forum, free from local
hostilities” to address those issues. If the case is moved to federal
court, Trump lawyers wrote, they will then seek to have the verdict
overturned and the case dismissed. If it remains in state court, with
sentencing proceeding as scheduled, it could amount to election
interference, they said.</p>
<p>“The ongoing proceedings will continue to cause direct and
irreparable harm to President Trump — the leading candidate in the 2024
Presidential election — and voters located far beyond Manhattan,” Trump
lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove wrote in a 64-page U.S. District
Court filing.</p>
<p>Trump was convicted in state court in Manhattan of 34 counts of
falsifying business records related to a payment to bury affair
allegations that threatened to cloud his 2016 presidential run. Even if
the case isn’t moved to federal court, the potential delay caused by
litigation surrounding Trump’s effort could give him a critical reprieve
as he navigates the aftermath of his criminal conviction and the
homestretch of his presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Separately, the state court judge who presided over the trial, Juan
M. Merchan, is weighing Trump’s requests to postpone sentencing until
after Election Day, November 5, and to overturn the verdict and dismiss
the case in the wake of the Supreme Court’s immunity decision.</p>
<p>The high court’s July 1 ruling reins in prosecutions of ex-presidents
for official acts and restricts prosecutors in pointing to official acts
as evidence that a president’s unofficial actions were illegal.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers argue that in light of the ruling, jurors in the hush
money case should not have heard such evidence as former White House
staffers describing how the then-president reacted to news coverage of
the deal to pay hush money to porn actor Stormy Daniels.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers had previously invoked presidential immunity in a
failed bid last year to get the hush money case moved from state court
to federal court. A federal judge rejected that request, clearing the
way for Trump’s historic trial in state court.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein rejected Trump’s claim that
allegations in the hush money indictment involved official duties,
writing in July 2023, “The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the
matter was a purely a personal item of the president — a cover-up of an
embarrassing event.”</p>
<p>“Hush money paid to an adult film star is not related to a
president’s official acts. It does not reflect in any way the color of
the president’s official duties,” Hellerstein added.</p>
<p>A message seeking comment was left with the Manhattan district
attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case.</p>

vows tougher approach on migration, supports weapons for Israel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>savannah, georgia/washington — Kamala Harris vowed a tougher approach
to migration along the U.S. southern border and said she would not
withhold weapons to Israel, in her first interview with a major news
organization since becoming the Democratic nominee for president.</p>
<p>In the interview with CNN anchor Dana Bash, Harris sought to show she
is in command of the issues and give Americans a sense of her policy
positions with little more than two months until Election Day on
November 5.</p>
<p>Harris said she would renew a push for comprehensive border
legislation that would tighten migration into the United States and
vowed to “enforce our laws” against border crossings.</p>
<p>“We have laws that have to be followed and enforced, that address and
deal with people who cross our border illegally, and there should be
consequence,” Harris said.</p>
<p>She also hewed closely to President Joe Biden’s strong support of
Israel and rejected calls from some in the Democratic Party that
Washington should rethink sending weapons to Israel because of the heavy
Palestinian death toll in Gaza.</p>
<p>She said she supports a strong Israel but “we must get a deal done”
to get a cease-fire in the Gaza conflict.</p>
<p>“No, we have to get a (cease-fire and hostage) deal done,” Harris
said when asked if she would withhold weapons to Israel. She has been
Biden’s vice president since the start of his administration.</p>
<p>Abbas Alawieh, a co-founder of the Uncommitted National Movement that
has protested against Biden’s policy, expressed frustration over Harris’
response on Gaza.</p>
<p>“If the vice president is interested in a cease-fire, she must
support an immediate stop to sending the fire,” Alawieh said.</p>
<p>Harris, joined by her vice presidential running mate, Minnesota
Governor Tim Walz, also said she would like to add a Republican to her
cabinet if she wins the election.</p>
<p>“I think it’s important to have people at the table when some of the
most important decisions are being made that have different views,
different experiences. And I think it would be to the benefit of the
American public to have a member of my cabinet who was a Republican,”
she said. </p>
<p>Surging in polls</p>
<p>Since becoming the Democratic candidate for president last month,
Harris has surged in the polls, brought in hundreds of millions of
dollars in campaign donations, and had a series of forceful campaign
speeches.</p>
<p>She leads Trump 45% to 41% in a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on
Thursday that showed the vice president sparking new enthusiasm among
voters.</p>
<p>Some critics suggested she might be less polished in unscripted
settings like a TV interview, but she appeared to make no major mistakes
on Thursday.</p>
<p>Harris defended her and Biden’s handling of inflation, saying they
inherited a pandemic-ravaged economy that she said Trump had mismanaged.
She said much work had been done to lower prices but that “prices are
still too high.”</p>
<p>Jeremi Suri, history and public affairs professor at the University
of Texas at Austin, said Harris came across as knowledgeable and a
“consensus builder” in the interview but she could have had “more
concrete and specific answers” on what she would do on her first day as
president.</p>
<p>Harris has moved more toward the center on some issues from the time
she ran for president in 2020 until she took over from Biden last month
as the Democrats’ choice to face Republican former President Donald
Trump in the election.</p>
<p>She has toughened her position on migration along the southern U.S.
border with Mexico. She also no longer wants a ban on fracking, an
energy production method that employs many people in Pennsylvania, one
of a handful of swing states that could decide the election.</p>
<p>When asked about her policy shifts, Harris said: “My values have not
changed.”</p>
<p>Harris dismissed a comment from Trump in which he questioned whether
she was a Black American. “Same old tired playbook,” she said. “Next
question, please.”</p>
<p>Trump, in a post on Truth Social, responded to the interview by
saying: “I look so forward to Debating Comrade Kamala Harris and
exposing her for the fraud she is.” Trump often falsely refers to Harris
as a Marxist.</p>
<p>Though she has taken questions from journalists on the campaign trail
and been interviewed on TikTok in recent days, she had, until Thursday,
not done a one-on-one interview with a major network or print journalist
since Biden ended his reelection campaign on July 21 and endorsed
her.</p>
<p>Bash, who co-moderated the June 27 debate between Trump and Biden
that ultimately led to the president’s departure from the race,
conducted the interview in Savannah, Georgia, as Harris and Walz were on
a campaign bus tour.</p>
<p>Harris widens lead over Trump with boost from women, Hispanics,
Reuters/Ipsos poll finds.</p>

<h2 id="pg_hint_plan-v1.7.0-released">pg_hint_plan v1.7.0 Released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-30, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
The pg_hint_plan development team is pleased to announce pg_hint_plan
1.7.0. This release of pg_hint_plan adds compatibility with PostgreSQL
17, and includes various improvements and bug fixes. For more details,
see the
<a href="https://github.com/ossc-db/pg_hint_plan/releases">release
notes</a>. This new major version includes the following new features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Addition of a lexer to parse the query indexes.
</li>
<li>
Integration of query IDs with the hint table, instead of normalized
strings.
</li>
<li>
Removal of pg_hint_plan.hints_anywhere.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
pg_hint_plan is a PostgreSQL extension that offers the possibility to
tweak PostgreSQL execution plans using so-called “hints” in SQL
comments. For more information, see
<a href="https://github.com/ossc-db/pg_hint_plan/">the project page</a>.
</p>
<p>
The documentation of the project is published at
<a href="https://pg-hint-plan.readthedocs.io/">this page</a>, and is
synced up automatically from the source repository.
</p>
<p>
A new set of minor releases is available down to PostgreSQL 12, each
marked with the following versions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
pg_hint_plan 1.6.1, compatible with PostgreSQL 16.
</li>
<li>
pg_hint_plan 1.5.2, compatible with PostgreSQL 15.
</li>
<li>
pg_hint_plan 1.4.3, compatible with PostgreSQL 14.
</li>
<li>
pg_hint_plan 1.3.10, compatible with PostgreSQL 12 and 13.
</li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Notable changes in this set of releases include the following bug fixes,
where applicable:

Scan hints. This has proved to cause unwelcome plan instabilities, so
this has been removed for all stable branches.
</li>
<li>
Handle better the hint table if the extension is not created.
</li>
<li>
Various improvements and fixes to documentation and regression test
suite.
</li>
<li>
Addition of META.json to distribute the module in PGXN.
</li>
<li>
Fix crash when retrieving query hint, impacting only PostgreSQL 12 and
13.

<h2 id="china-takes-mild-tone-on-us-officials-visit">China takes mild
tone on US official’s visit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Beijing has adopted a conciliatory tone in its reporting
on this week’s visit by White House national security adviser Jake
Sullivan, emphasizing cooperation and open communication channels while
claiming that Washington remains “incorrect” on its China policies.</p>
<p>Sullivan’s tightly scheduled three-day trip to Beijing ended Thursday
after he met with Chinese officials, including the country’s top leader,
Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>In a readout of Sullivan’s meeting with Wang Yi, China’s top
diplomat, the Foreign Ministry of China on Wednesday called the
conversation “candid, substantive and constructive,” a phrase that was
echoed by a White House statement regarding the meeting.</p>
<p>Sullivan was the first White House national security adviser to visit
China in eight years, a period that saw contacts between the countries
grow increasingly contentious over issues that included
military-to-military relations, cybersecurity, espionage and the war in
Ukraine.</p>
<p>It was Sullivan’s fifth in-person meeting with Wang since May 2023.
The two had previously held talks in Bangkok, Vienna, Washington and
Malta. But Wednesday’s meeting marks the first time in this series of
talks that Beijing included some of the U.S. side’s views in its
readout.</p>
<p>“The U.S. and China will coexist peacefully on this planet for a long
time,” Sullivan was quoted as saying in the Chinese readout. “The goal
of U.S. policies is to find a way that allows for a sustainable
development of the U.S.-China relations.”</p>
<p>According to Beijing’s readout, Sullivan defined the two countries’
ties as a mixture of cooperation and competition, a characterization
that’s been the core principle of the Biden administration’s China
strategy.</p>
<p>Some experts say the fact that China allowed space in its readout for
U.S. talking points signals Beijing’s increased openness to working with
Washington.</p>
<p>Dali Yang, a political science professor at the University of
Chicago, told VOA Mandarin Service that China used to reject the Biden
administration’s characterization of the U.S.-China relationship.</p>
<p>“But it looks like the China side is now relatively more accepting of
the U.S. side’s view,” Yang said. “Or at least Beijing has accepted that
this is the kind of U.S. position that China must deal with.”</p>
<p>After Wang, Sullivan met separately with Xi and senior military
official Zhang Youxia. These meetings focused on topics that included
Taiwan, the South China Sea, trade policies, U.S. sanctions on Chinese
businesses and entities, conflicts in Gaza and the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The meetings appeared to be cordial. Photos and footage released by
Chinese state media show Sullivan shaking hands with a smiling Xi and a
smiling Zhang.</p>
<p>US ‘incorrect’ in Beijing’s narrative</p>
<p>Smiling faces and words of cooperation aside, however, Beijing
continues to paint the U.S. as the one that needs to adjust its policies
and move closer to Beijing’s positions on issues.</p>
<p>Xi told Sullivan the U.S. should “work with China in the same
direction, view China and its development in a positive and rational
light, see each other’s development as an opportunity rather than a
challenge, and work with China to find a right way for two major
countries to get along.”</p>
<p>Zhang urged the U.S. to “correct its strategic perceptions of China”
and respect China’s “core interests” by halting arms sales to Taiwan and
to “stop spreading false narratives on Taiwan.”</p>
<p>Prior to Sullivan’s arrival in Beijing, the Global Times, China’s
state media outlet, published a commentary criticizing Washington’s
“incorrect” understanding of China.</p>
<p>“The U.S. needs to fundamentally change its perception of China and
its strategic positioning toward China,” according to the article.</p>
<p>The Global Times told Sullivan that “truly listening to and
understanding Beijing’s words and making a proper contribution to
establishing the correct understanding between China and the U.S. should
be one of the standards to evaluate the success of his visit to
China.”</p>
<p>China’s political commentators have gone even further, calling on
Beijing to remain tough.</p>
<p>In a commentary, Shen Yi, an international relations professor at
Fudan University in Shanghai who has a huge following on social media,
wrote that the U.S. is in no position to make any demands toward China
because of the domestic economic difficulties in which he contends
Washington is trapped.</p>
<p>“China should be sufficiently confident that it’s the U.S. who needs
help from China,” he wrote. “Under this new frame of understanding, we
have reasons to believe that China does not need to compromise with the
U.S.”</p>
<p>This kind of tough narrative, often pushed by Beijing and adopted by
online commentators during the past decade, remains popular on social
media. But Yang of the University of Chicago told VOA Mandarin Service
that Beijing seems to be moving away from this kind of rhetoric.</p>
<p>“When China is facing a variety of challenges, and when the leaders
of China have to maintain and manage China-U.S. relations, they have to
think beyond just making tougher and tougher talks” and relying on this
type of approach to be effective.</p>
<p>“The two sides actually have a lot of common interests,” he said.</p>

restarts immigration program for 4 countries with more vetting</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The Biden administration is restarting an immigration
program that allows migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela
to come to the United States, and it is including “additional vetting”
of their U.S.-based financial sponsors following fraud concerns.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security had suspended the program earlier
this month to investigate the concerns but indicated that an internal
review found no widespread fraud among sponsors.</p>
<p>“Together with our existing rigorous vetting of potential
beneficiaries seeking to travel to the United States, these new
procedures for supporters have strengthened the integrity of these
processes and will help protect against exploitation of beneficiaries,”
the agency said.</p>
<p>The program launched in January 2023 and is a major piece of the
Biden administration’s immigration policies that create or expand
pathways for legal entry while restricting asylum for those who cross
the border illegally.</p>
<p>The policy is aimed at countries that send large numbers of people to
the United States and generally refuse to accept those who are deported.
It is paired with commitments from Mexico to take back people from those
countries who cross the U.S. border illegally.</p>
<p>Under the program, the U.S. accepts up to 30,000 people a month from
the four countries for two years and offers eligibility for work
authorization. To qualify, migrants must have a financial sponsor in the
U.S. who vouches for them and fly into an American airport at their own
expense, rather than crossing at the southern border. Those acting as
sponsors and the migrants hoping to come to America undergo vetting by
Homeland Security.</p>
<p>Republicans have repeatedly criticized the program as an end-run
around immigration laws. They immediately attacked the administration
when the program was suspended early this month, pointing to it as
further validation of their concerns about whether migrants were
properly vetted.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement Thursday that
the additional vetting would include more scrutiny of the financial
records that U.S.-based sponsors are required to submit as well as their
criminal backgrounds. Sponsors will be required to submit fingerprints,
and the agency will bolster steps to identify sponsors who are
fraudulent and when one files numerous applications.</p>
<p>DHS said an internal review found some cases of fraud, such as
sponsors using fake Social Security numbers, but that the majority of
cases it investigated had a reasonable explanation, such as a typo when
a sponsor was submitting information online.</p>
<p>“Since the inception of the process, a very small number of
supporters were found to have fraud or criminal issues warranting
referral to law enforcement for investigation and/or appropriate
action,” the agency said.</p>
<p>Homeland Security also said it had not found issues in vetting the
migrants themselves, saying those who come to the U.S. under the program
“have been thoroughly screened and vetted.”</p>
<p>When it announced the program’s suspension, Homeland Security didn’t
say when processing stopped. But the news broke after the Federation for
American Immigration Reform, a group that favors immigration
restrictions, cited an internal agency report that raised questions
about fraud.</p>
<p>Neither Homeland Security nor FAIR have provided that report. FAIR
asserted that the report showed that 3,218 sponsors were responsible for
more than 100,000 filings and that 24 of the top 1,000 Social Security
numbers used by sponsors corresponded to dead people.</p>
<p>Arrests for illegal crossings have plummeted among the four
nationalities. Cubans were arrested 5,065 times during the first half of
the year, compared with more than 42,000 arrests in November 2022 alone.
Haitians were arrested 304 times during the first six months of the
year, compared with a peak of nearly 18,000 in September 2021.</p>

<h2 id="make-your-own-cdn-with-openbsd-base-and-just-2-packages">Make
your own CDN with OpenBSD base and just 2 packages</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>The internet today relies TOO MUCH on just a few big players. When
one of them stops working, half the world is impacted because too many
services, in my opinion, depend on them. “Too big to fail,” some might
say. “Single Point of Failure,” I respond.” The strength of the internet
has always been its extreme decentralization, which is now less evident
due to this phenomenon. In this article, I want to show how easy it is
to create a self-hosted CDN using OpenBSD and just two external
packages: Varnish and Lego. ↫ Stefano Marinelli Stefano Marinelli is a
gem of a person, and a great voice for the wider BSD community. In this
article he covers building your own CDN using OpenBSD, and a few days
ago he published a similar article, but using FreeBSD instead. These are
excellent resources for anyone who wants to take self-hosting and data
ownership to the next level, even cutting out big players like
Cloudflare which often don’t have the best interests of us regular
people at heart. It’s probably not for everyone, but odds are if you’re
reading OSNews, you might be capable of and interested in doing this.
And Marinelli’s point about the internet being overly reliant on a just
a few small players is well taken. We often focus on the front-end of
the monopolised internet – Google, Apple, Microsoft, and so on – but the
backend and infrastructure often also suffers from the same problem.
These articles focus on effectively replacing Cloudflare, but something
like Amazon Web Services is also a prime example of a service that’s
basically become too big to fail. That’s not at all how the internet was
supposed to work, but unfettered capitalism ruins everything, and this
is no exception. While a few of us breaking away from the monopolies and
building our own alternatives isn’t going to have any material impact,
it at least aides in a cleaner conscience.</p>

<h2 id="americans-say-okay-whatever-to-permitting-reform">Americans Say
‘Okay, Whatever’ to Permitting Reform</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-29, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzU3MDk4Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NDc0Mjg0Mn0.raG9PS5Wd01AqDpDcctzrKU80LEhRPBSkYzicao85F8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Most Americans support the idea of a bipartisan law that would make it
easier to build new clean energy projects while benefiting some oil and
gas development, according to a Heatmap News poll conducted earlier this
month.
</p>
<p>
Some 52% of Americans said they backed the general idea of the
legislation, the poll found. About a quarter of Americans opposed it,
and roughly another quarter said they weren’t sure.
</p>
<p>
That’s good news for one of the last remaining pieces of environmental
policy that Congress could pass under this presidency: a bipartisan
proposal from Senators Joe Manchin and John Barrasso that would speed up
the process of building climate-friendly infrastructure in exchange for
concessions to the oil and gas industry.
</p>
<p>
The legislation is meant to bind together Democratic and Republican
goals for the country’s energy development. Democrats in Congress and
the White House are worried that permitting delays and excessive red
tape could now slow down America’s shift away from fossil fuels. This
year, for instance, the United States will
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/04/climate/us-wind-energy-solar-power.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>add
less new wind capacity</u></a> than it has in any year since 2020.
Experts say that’s due in large part to the lack of new power lines to
parts of the country where wind is abundant. Even
<a href="https://citizensclimatelobby.org/blog/policy/bill-mckibben-talks-yimby-and-clean-energy-permitting-reform/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>many</u></a>
<a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2023/04/yimby-nimby-progressives-clean-energy-infrastructure-housing-development-wind-solar-bill-mckibben/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>progressives</u></a>,
who have historically championed stricter permitting and environmental
review laws, now favor altering them in the abstract to speed the
zero-carbon buildout — although prominent groups
<a href="https://thirdact.org/sacramento/2024/07/26/draft/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>have</u></a>
<a href="https://www.lcv.org/media-center/lcv-statement-on-the-energy-permitting-reform-act-of-2024/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR3zaTRePlLv_ySRfYty9hk1TROuqdUH5tcuwBUhgt-KyoPBWNlNmu5cqFw_aem_0_0Xl3f0BqMZVxfaikbrgw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>opposed</u></a>
this particular deal.
</p>
<p>
Republicans, meanwhile, have accused the Biden administration of
<a href="https://tiffany.house.gov/media/editorials-letters-and-articles/republicans-unveil-effort-remove-biden-admins-barriers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dragging
its feet</u></a> on making federally owned lands available for oil and
gas development. The Biden administration leased 95% fewer acres in 2023
than the Trump administration did in 2019,
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/3-ways-biden-reshaped-oil-drilling-on-public-lands/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according
to </u><u><em><em>E&amp;E News</em></em></u></a><em><em>.</em></em>
</p>
<p>
Under President Biden, the Interior Department has
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-joe-biden-oil-gas-public-land-environment-4d2c446ee78f6ed172f28f0fa01c6826#" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>acknowledged</u></a>
that oil and gas drilling on public lands worsens climate change, but
said that information alone does not allow it to block new leases. From
2005 to 2019, roughly one quarter of all fossil fuel extraction in the
United States
<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-021-03302-x" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>happened
on</u></a> federal land.
</p>
<p>
Beyond those facts, however, having a national conversation about
permitting reform is tricky because so many proposals are so deep in the
weeds that their importance often isn’t immediately obvious. How many
voters are ready to debate whether the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission should be able to fast-track certain new power lines? Or why
there should be a statute of limitations for some National Environmental
Policy Act lawsuits? (If you’re curious, I wrote
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/permitting-reform-transmission-nepa-geothermal" target="_self"><u>a
cheat sheet</u></a> on some of the biggest permitting reform proposals
last year.)
</p>
<p>
Indeed, many of the people Heatmap polled told us they didn’t know
enough to decide whether they were for or against the bill — but those
who did feel confident answering largely said they were in favor of it.
Across cities and suburbs, political parties and age groups, permitting
reform is about 15 to 25 points above water. Republicans are somewhat
more amenable to the compromise than Democrats: 58% of GOP voters
support the proposal, while only 47% of Democrats do. Independents are
most skeptical at 44%, though the idea of the deal still has more
independent supporters than opponents.
</p>
<p>
The idea of a deal commands majority support in every region of the
country. It’s also supported by most Americans who say they live in
rural areas, small towns, suburbs, and small cities. (Among Americans
who live in large cities, the measure commands 48% support.) Even
Americans who say they would oppose some forms of energy development in
their area — such as a hydrogen project or battery storage plant — back
the proposal.
</p>
<p>
This all suggests that the permitting reform deal could remain largely
depoliticized as Congress continues to debate it through the fall — if
you were to summarize respondents’ reactions to the survey, it might
look like, “Sure, whatever, sounds good.” The public’s apparent openness
to a deal also comes as its concern for urgent action on climate change
has
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/09/what-the-data-says-about-americans-views-of-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>somewhat
cooled</u></a> since 2020.
</p>
<p>
Over the past few years, too, polls have detected a substantive drop in
Republican support for clean energy development. While 54% of
conservative Republicans backed clean energy in 2018
<a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-in-the-american-mind-december-2018/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according
to a Yale poll</u></a>, that figure has since fallen to 24%. Building
more clean energy does not even command a majority of liberal and
moderate Republican support anymore, Anthony Leiserowitz, a Yale
professor of climate change communication, told me.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2024/06/27/how-americans-view-national-local-and-personal-energy-choices/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>A
separate poll</u></a> — from the Pew Research Center —
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/climate/pew-poll-renewable-energy.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>found</u></a>
that Republican support for building more wind and solar farms has
fallen by 20 percentage points since President Joe Biden took office,
although it also showed that both energy sources commanded majority
support.
</p>
<p>
“Clean energy used to be one of those things that pretty much everyone
supported more or less,” Leiserowitz said. “That is important. That is
the backdrop to the deeper currents behind the increasing opposition to
wind farms and solar farms across the country.”
</p>
<p>
“Clean energy,” he added, “has become much more politicized than it was
in the past.”

<h2 id="japans-real-first-console-bandais-tv-jack-5000">Japan’s real
first console? Bandai’s TV Jack 5000</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Epoch Cassette Vision is often reported as the first Japanese
cartridge-based game console. But reality is always a bit more
complicated. In 1978, years before the Cassette Vision, two Japanese
companies put together cartridge-based game consoles that were unique to
Japan, but relied on technology and chips licensed from American firms.
And hey, despite my whirlwind tour of Pong consoles, I never looked at
GI chips. Behold, the <em>breathes in</em> Bandai Video Mate All Color
TV Jack Addon 5000. (longest console name in the history of the blog?)
This 1978 console was the follow-on to Bandai’s earlier Video Mate TV
Jack consoles, which were more or less the same as everyone else’s
Pong-on-a-chip consoles. (The TV Jack 2500 appears rather intriguing,
but we’re not looking at that one today) ↫ Nicole Express As usual,
Nicole’s deep dives into weird consoles you’ve never heard of are a
great read, and this one is no exception. There are many things that
make the Jack Addon 5000 unique and interesting, but the one thing
that’s really cool is that while the game lives on the cartridge, the
colour lives inside the console itself. Inside the cartridge you’ll only
find the monochrome game chip; the colour is added by another chip
that’s fitted inside the console. Only four cartridges were ever
released for the system, so it’s not particularly more versatile than
contemporary Pong clones that had multiple built-in games or game modes.
Still, it’s an interesting footnote, and I’m so happy we got such a
detailed look at this console.</p>

<h2 id="vietnams-defense-minister-to-visit-us-next-month">Vietnam’s
defense minister to visit US next month</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Vietnam’s minister of national defense, Phan Van Giang,
is set to visit Washington next month for a high-level meeting with U.S.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, U.S. and Vietnamese officials tell
VOA.</p>
<p>The minister is expected to visit Washington from September 7-9 to
strengthen defense cooperation between the two countries, according to a
Vietnamese defense ministry official and a U.S. official who spoke on
condition of anonymity because the trip has not been officially
announced. </p>
<p>During the talks, the sides are expected to discuss a range of
defense-related topics, including training initiatives and the lingering
legacies of the Vietnam War. Giang is also expected to sign an agreement
to purchase military equipment from the U.S., though Vietnamese
officials said the details of the deal are still being work out.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese Embassy in Washington has yet to comment on the
visit.</p>
<p>This meeting marks the first encounter between the defense chiefs of
Vietnam and the U.S. since the two countries upgraded their bilateral
relations to a Strategic Comprehensive Partnership a year ago,
coinciding with U.S. President Joe Biden’s historic visit to Vietnam. It
also signals a strengthening of military ties and could pave the way for
further cooperation between the two nations in the future.</p>
<p>The expected visit follows the 13th Political, Security, and Defense
Dialogue held in Hanoi on August 26, the first such dialogue since the
relationship upgrade.</p>
<p>U.S. Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International
Security, Bonnie Jenkins, who led the U.S. delegation at the dialogue,
emphasized the U.S. commitment to enhancing defense and security
cooperation with Vietnam. This cooperation includes programs on military
training, medicine, peacekeeping, counter-terrorism, and
cybersecurity.</p>
<p>The last face-to-face meeting between Giang and Austin took place in
November 2023, during an ASEAN defense ministers’ meeting in Jakarta.
During that encounter, the two discussed measures to boost bilateral
defense cooperation, with a particular focus on efforts to address war
legacies and provide humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p>Topics covered included demining and the removal of unexploded
ordnances, dioxin cleanup, and accounting for Missing in Action (MIA)
soldiers.</p>
<p>Vietnam’s defense minister also extended an invitation to U.S.
defense companies to participate in Vietnam’s second international
defense exhibition, scheduled for late 2024.</p>

id="economics-tensions-blamed-for-chinese-students-shifting-from-us-to-australia-britain">Economics,
tensions blamed for Chinese students shifting from US to Australia,
Britain</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Austin, Texas — U.S. universities are welcoming international
students as the academic year begins. But while the total number of
foreign students is steadily growing, the top sending country, China, is
showing signs of leveling out or shrinking.</p>
<p>Industry analysts say the negative trend is mainly due to higher
costs amid China’s struggling economy, with a growing number of students
going to less expensive countries like Australia and Britain, and tense
ties between Washington and Beijing.</p>
<p>The number of foreign students studying in the U.S. in 2022-23 passed
1 million for the first time since the COVID pandemic, said Open Doors,
an information resource on international students and scholars.</p>
<p>While the U.S. saw a nearly 12% total increase year-on-year for that
period, the number of international students from China, its top source,
fell by 0.2% to 289,526.</p>
<p>That’s 600 fewer students than the 2021-22 academic year, when their
numbers dropped by nearly 9%. The COVID pandemic saw Chinese student
numbers drop in 2020-21 by nearly 15%, in line with the world total
drop.</p>
<p>While it’s not yet clear if the drop is a leveling out or a
fluctuating decline, analysts say China’s struggling economy and the
high cost of studying in the U.S. are the main reasons for the fall in
student numbers.</p>
<p>Vincent Chen, a Chinese study abroad consultant based in Shanghai,
said although most of his clients are still interested in studying in
the U.S., there is a clear downward trend, while applicants for
Anglophone universities in Australia and Britain have been
increasing.</p>
<p>“If you just want to go abroad, a one-year master’s degree in the
U.K. is much cheaper,” Chen said. “Many people can’t afford to study in
the U.S., so they have to settle for the next best thing.”</p>
<p>Data from the nonprofit U.S. group College Board Research shows that
in the 2023-24 academic year, the average tuition and fees for a U.S.
private college four-year education increased 4% to $41,540 compared
with the previous academic year.</p>
<p>The British Council said three to four years of undergraduate tuition
in Britain starts as low as $15,000.</p>
<p>The number of Chinese students in Britain was 154,260 in 2022-23,
according to the U.K. Higher Education Statistics Agency, HESA, up from
121,145 in the 2018/19 academic year.</p>
<p>Australia’s Home Affairs office said in the 2023-24 program year,
China was the top source foreign country for new student visa grants at
43,389, up slightly (1.5%) from the previous year.</p>
<p>Chen said Chinese state media’s negative portrayal of the United
States and concerns about discrimination have also contributed to the
shift.</p>
<p>Bruce Zhang, a Chinese citizen who received his master’s degree in
Europe after studying in China, told VOA Mandarin he had such an
incident occur to him after he was admitted to a U.S. university’s
Ph.D. program.</p>
<p>When he entered Boston’s Logan International Airport last year, Zhang
said customs officers questioned him for more than an hour about his
research, and if it had any links to the military, and took his computer
and mobile phone for examination.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, I had heard that U.S. customs might be stringent in
inspecting Chinese students, so I had relatively few study-related data
and documents on my personal computer,” he said. </p>
<p>Zhang was allowed to enter the U.S. for his studies in materials
science, but the questioning left him so rattled that he has encouraged
other Chinese to study elsewhere.</p>
<p>Cui Kai, a study abroad consultant in Massachusetts told VOA Mandarin
that experiences like Zhang’s or worse happen for a reason.</p>
<p>“Students who were questioned or their visas were revoked at the
customs are usually those who completed their undergraduate studies in
China and come to the U.S. for a master’s or doctoral degree in a
sensitive major,” said Cui.</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump signed Proclamation 10043 in June 2020,
prohibiting visas for any Chinese student who “has been employed by,
studied at, or conducted research at or on behalf of, an entity in the
PRC that implements or supports the PRC’s “military-civil fusion
strategy.”</p>
<p>The U.S. says China has been using students and scholars to gain
access to key technology and, under Proclamation 10043, revoked more
than 1,000 visas issued to Chinese nationals and has denied thousands
more.</p>
<p>Critics say the policy is costly to the U.S. and is encouraging
Chinese students to look to European and other universities.</p>

Army: Arlington cemetery official ‘abruptly pushed’ by Trump
staffer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Pentagon — The U.S. Army says a female Arlington National Cemetery
official was “abruptly pushed aside” by a campaign staffer for
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump as she was trying to ensure
that rules prohibiting political activities there were followed.</p>
<p>“This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the
ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,” an
Army spokesperson said in a written statement on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign has pushed back, saying that the former president
was granted permission to bring “campaign designated media” to Section
60 of the cemetery by Gold Star families.</p>
<p>“The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the
premises and for whatever reason, an unnamed individual, clearly
suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block
members of President Trump’s team during a very solemn ceremony,”
Trump’s spokesperson Steven Cheung said earlier this week.</p>
<p>Another top Trump aide, Chris LaCivita, issued a written statement
saying, “For a despicable individual to physically prevent President
Trump’s team from accompanying him to this solemn event is a disgrace
and does not deserve to represent the hallowed grounds of Arlington
National Cemetery. Whoever this individual is, spreading these lies are
dishonoring the men and women of our armed forces.”</p>
<p>However, rules at the military cemeteries in Arlington, Virginia,
“clearly prohibit political activities on cemetery grounds,” the Army
said. In other words, the Gold Star families who told the Trump campaign
that media representatives could be there did not have the authority to
allow campaign media to film the event.</p>
<p>The Army says the Trump campaign and participants in the August 26
ceremony had been made aware of the relevant federal laws before the
incident in which the cemetery employee was pushed.</p>
<p>“Consistent with the decorum expected at ANC, this employee acted
with professionalism and avoided further disruption. The incident was
reported to the JBM-HH (Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall) police
department, but the employee subsequently decided not to press charges,”
the Army said.</p>
<p>The Army now considers the matter closed.</p>
<p>Arlington National Cemetery hosts public wreath laying ceremonies at
the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier for individuals and groups who submit
requests to do so in advance.</p>
<p>“ANC conducts nearly 3,000 such public ceremonies a year without
incident,” the Army spokesperson said. “Its dedicated staff will
continue to ensure public ceremonies are conducted with the dignity and
respect the nation’s fallen deserve.”</p>

<p>date: 2024-08-29, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
The new way to buy an electric car is not to buy one at all.
</p>
<p>
Just three years ago, four out of five EV drivers had financed their car
or paid in cash, while only 21% had leased the EV, according to data
from
<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/08/01/2922873/0/en/After-a-Period-of-Decline-EVs-Provide-a-Jolt-to-the-Leasing-Market.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>TransUnion</u></a>.
But by the second quarter of this year, leasing had become the top
choice: 48.7% of people leased their new electric vehicle versus 34.7
percent who financed and 16.6% who paid in cash.
</p>
<p>
That’s a sea change in the way people shop for EVs, and it could be
great news for the electric car market — just think of all the gently
used cars that will flood the market when those leases end.

Why leasing has spiked
</h3>
<p>
There are numerous factors behind leasing’s ascendance, starting with
money matters. Electric cars still cost more than fossil fuel-burners,
but the monthly payment on a lease is almost always less than what you’d
pay per month to finance the full cost of a vehicle. In that way,
leasing brings EVs within reach for budget-minded drivers — Joseph Yoon,
consumer insights analyst at Edmunds, recently told me there are great
leasing deals aplenty on EVs because dealers want to move them off the
lots.
</p>
<p>
A tweak to the federal tax credits helped, too. It got more complicated
to buy an EV outright this year after the government restricted the
benefits to vehicles with a minimum amount of domestic manufacturing.
But the same rules don’t apply to leased vehicles, giving those who
lease an EV the option to get a discount on a car that wouldn’t
necessarily be eligible if they financed it.
</p>
<p>
There are other hypotheses about the rising popularity of the lease. A
bigwig at one of the credit bureaus
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/731325/new-evs-usa-leased-not-purchased/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told
</u><u><em><em>InsideEVs</em></em></u></a> that leasing reflects buyers’
comfort with the subscription model that has taken over our economy at
large. The data also shows that the total number of first-time lessees
has actually declined a little since 2019, which suggests to me that
perhaps a lot of people who always lease their vehicles decided over the
past few years that it was time to go for an EV.
</p>
<p>
Leasing is also simply an attractive choice given the current state of
electric vehicle offerings. Most of today’s most popular models haven’t
been on the road long enough to tell us much about how they’ll age — or
what might go wrong when they’re eight or 10 or 12 years old.
Lease-holders don’t have to worry about any of that. They need not worry
about the battery range inevitably fading, either.
</p>
<p>
For this reason I’ve begun, from time to time, to second-guess my own
decision to buy my EV. Rather than watching its battery diminish as the
years go by, I could have leased it, returned it after three years, and
gotten into a cool new EV that didn’t exist when I bought mine. Then
again, I’m closing in on the last monthly payment rather than being
locked into the cycle of forever payments that comes with leasing. So I
got that going for me, which is nice.
</p>
<h3>
Why that’s great for the EV market
</h3>
<p>
The jump in leasing is having a clear impact on the shape of the
electric vehicle market, where carmakers in the U.S., in particular, are
still having trouble putting out affordable EVs that buyers want. Luxury
buyers, on the other hand, have always favored leases as a way to keep
themselves in a shiny, new-ish car, and to avoid the unpleasant
experience of owning an out-of-warranty BMW, Mercedes-Benz, or Audi.
<a href="https://www.autonews.com/mobility-report/most-ev-sales-audi-bmw-mercedes-are-leases-tax-credit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Around
90%</u></a> of those three companies’ EVs are leased, a number that has
helped the Germany luxury brands get a foothold in the electric car
market (especially considering the staggering MSRPs of most of their
electric offerings).
</p>
<p>
And then there’s what happens to all those leased vehicles. Once a
typical three-year agreement expires, its driver must give back the
vehicle to the dealership, presumably in the undamaged, low-mileage
condition that’s specified in the terms of the lease. From there, the
vehicle goes on to start its second life as someone else’s
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67dYxOXPtfQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>brand
new used car</u></a> — which is why it’s good news that lots of people
are leasing EVs.
</p>
<p>
While leasing is one way to work around the high sticker prices of EVs,
buying used is another. Used vehicles have long been a better deal
because somebody else suffered the financial penalty of buying a new car
and seeing its value plummet the moment they drove it off the lot. (In
fact, what you’re really paying for when you lease a car is the severe
depreciation it undergoes during its first few years of life. The
dealership has to get that money from lease customers because they’ll
get much less for the vehicle when it returns from its lease as a
three-year-old and they resell it as a used car.)
</p>
<p>
The used EV market, though, hasn’t been particularly robust to date. For
one thing, there just aren’t that many vehicles on the market since EV
sales really only took off in the past few years. Further limiting
supply are the plummeting
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/electric-vehicles-shopping-price-used-5f638c3a3f3c729b55860d53ee25270b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>prices</u></a>
of used EVs, which appear to be depreciating much faster than gasoline
cars or hybrids. Since owners would recoup so little from selling their
EVs, more of them are hanging onto their cars.
</p>
<p>
That’s why the rise in leased EVs could be good news for everyone else.
In a few years, all of those electric vehicles will return to the lot
where many will become gently used, certified pre-owned cars that sell
for much less than new vehicles. And though the fate of the federal tax
credits after this year’s election are uncertain, used EVs currently
<em><em>also</em></em> qualify for a tax break.
</p>
<p>
Used electric vehicles have their own set of concerns. Their drivers
won’t enjoy the full driving range that the battery offered when new.
They’ll be responsible for the longer-term repairs if they want to keep
the car running indefinitely. But used EVs with 80% or 90% of their
original range are plenty useful, and given those prices and tax breaks,
they’re a steal, too. And with a lot of leased EVs soon to enter the
secondary market, you might even be able to find one.

Steppings are basically chip revisions where they don’t change

second quarter growth stronger than estimated, government says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. economy expanded more than initially estimated
in the second quarter this year, the Department of Commerce said
Thursday, on stronger consumer spending than originally anticipated.</p>
<p>The world’s biggest economy grew at an annual rate of 3.0% in the
April-to-June period, up from 2.8% according to an earlier estimate.</p>
<p>Analysts had expected no revision to the figure.</p>
<p>“The update primarily reflected an upward revision to consumer
spending,” the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly robust consumption — even in the face of high interest
rates — has helped to bolster the U.S. economy in recent times. But with
households depleting pandemic-era savings, the anticipation was for
consumption to pull back.</p>
<p>In the latest revision, the higher spending was partly offset by
downward revisions in areas such as business investment, exports and
government spending.</p>
<p>Imports, however, were revised higher.</p>
<p>The 3.0% figure for the second quarter this year was an uptick from
1.4% growth in the first quarter.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve rapidly increased interest rates to tackle
surging inflation in 2022. It is widely expected to make its first
post-pandemic rate cut in September. This could provide a boost to the
economy.</p>

id="plot-to-attack-taylor-swifts-vienna-shows-was-intended-to-kill-thousands-cia-official-says">Plot
to attack Taylor Swift’s Vienna shows was intended to kill thousands,
CIA official says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Berlin — The suspects in the foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift
concerts in Vienna earlier this month sought to kill “tens of thousands”
of fans before the CIA discovered intelligence that disrupted the
planning and led to arrests, the agency’s deputy director said.</p>
<p>The CIA notified Austrian authorities of the scheme, which allegedly
included links to the Islamic State group. The intelligence and
subsequent arrests ultimately led to the cancellation of three sold-out
Eras Tour shows, devastating fans who had traveled across the globe to
see Swift in concert.</p>
<p>CIA Deputy Director David Cohen addressed the failed plot during the
annual Intelligence and National Security Summit, held this week in
Maryland.</p>
<p>“They were plotting to kill a huge number — tens of thousands of
people at this concert, including I am sure many Americans — and were
quite advanced in this,” Cohen said Wednesday. “The Austrians were able
to make those arrests because the agency and our partners in the
intelligence community provided them information about what this
ISIS-connected group was planning to do.”</p>
<p>Austrian officials said the main suspect, a 19-year-old Austrian man,
was inspired by the Islamic State group. He allegedly planned to attack
outside the stadium, where upwards of 30,000 fans were expected to
gather, with knives or homemade explosives. Another 65,000 fans were
likely to be inside the venue. Investigators discovered chemical
substances and technical devices during a raid of the suspect’s
home.</p>
<p>Austria’s interior minister, Gerhard Karner, previously said help
from other intelligence agencies was needed because Austrian
investigators, unlike some foreign services, can’t legally monitor text
messages.</p>
<p>The 19-year-old’s lawyer has said the allegations were “overacting at
its best,” and contended Austrian authorities were “presenting this
exaggeratedly” in order to get new surveillance powers.</p>
<p>Swift broke her silence about the cancellations last week after her
London shows had concluded.</p>
<p>“Having our Vienna shows cancelled was devastating,” she wrote in a
statement posted to Instagram. “The reason for the cancellations filled
me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of guilt because so
many people had planned on coming to those shows.”</p>
<p>She thanked authorities — “thanks to them, we were grieving concerts
and not lives,” she wrote — and said she waited to speak until the
European leg of her Eras Tour concluded to prioritize safety.</p>
<p>“Let me be very clear: I am not going to speak about something
publicly if I think doing so might provoke those who would want to harm
the fans who come to my shows,” she wrote.</p>
<p>Concert organizer Barracuda Music said it canceled the three-night
Vienna run that would have begun Aug. 8 because the arrests made in
connection to the conspiracy were too close to showtime.</p>
<p>The main suspect and a 17-year-old were taken into custody on Aug. 6,
the day before the cancellations were announced. A third suspect, 18,
was arrested Aug. 8. Their names have not been released in line with
Austrian privacy rules.</p>
<p>The shows in London, the next stop after Vienna, came on the heels of
a stabbing at a Swift-themed dance class that left three little girls
dead in the U.K. In a statement issued after the Southport attack, Swift
said she was “just completely in shock” and “at a complete loss for how
to ever convey my sympathies to these families.” News outlets reported
that Swift met with some of the survivors backstage in London.</p>
<p>The Vienna plot also drew comparisons to a 2017 attack by a suicide
bomber at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, that killed
22 people. The bomb detonated at the end of Grande’s concert as
thousands of young fans were leaving, becoming the deadliest extremist
attack in the United Kingdom in recent years.</p>
<p>Cohen on Wednesday praised the CIA’s work in preventing the planned
violence, saying that other counterterrorism “successes” in foiling
plots typically go unheralded.</p>
<p>“I can tell you within my agency, and I’m sure in others, there were
people who thought that was a really good day for Langley,” he said,
referring to the CIA headquarters. “And not just the Swifties in my
workforce.”</p>
<p>The record-smashing tour is on hiatus until the fall.</p>

id="after-20-years-killer-invasive-snakehead-fish-havent-devoured-the-competition">After
20 years, killer, invasive snakehead fish haven’t devoured the
competition</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Fredericksburg, Virginia — Most mornings, when the weather
cooperates, angler Mike Sielicki can be found out on the water in
Fredericksburg, Virginia — about an hour’s drive from Washington —
trying to hook a species of fish that was once considered a dangerous
threat to the surrounding aquatic wildlife.</p>
<p>“To me, it’s the best fish that ever hit the United States,” Sielicki
says. “I hope it winds up going in every body of water so everybody can
enjoy it.”</p>
<p>Sielicki has fished for northern snakeheads for 20 years, since they
first showed up in Potomac Creek, a shallow inlet that feeds into the
Potomac River, a major Washington-area waterway. Through his company,
Apex Predators Potomac Creek, he takes paying customers out on his boat
to fish for the invasive predator, which originally came from Asia.</p>
<p>“I have a fair amount of people that come from out of the state, out
of the United States, that come fish with me,” he says on a quiet August
morning when the snakeheads are proving elusive so far. “The water here
is very shallow, gets very grassy, and that’s their perfect
habitat.”</p>
<p>Snakeheads first appeared in the Washington area in 2002. Almost
immediately, local wildlife officials sounded the alarm. Scientists
worried that snakeheads would decimate this area’s native predator fish
populations, including the prized largemouth bass.</p>
<p>“The Potomac River is a renowned destination throughout the country
for bass tournaments and sport bass fishing. It’s huge,” says John
Odenkirk, a fisheries biologist with the Virginia Department of Wildlife
Resources. “And so, that was the concern, that this fish [snakehead] was
going to destroy that, because they were kind of the same level at the
top of the food chain.”</p>
<p>Snakeheads, which can grow to more than 83 centimeters long, have
pointy teeth and can breathe air, which means they can survive out of
the water for several days — as long as their skin remains moist.</p>
<p>Snakeheads also spawn twice a year, while similar level fish only
spawn once a year. Officials worried these unique qualities would give
snakeheads the edge over native top-level predators.</p>
<p>“So, on paper, it’s like, ‘Wow, they got some competitive advantage
here.’ … What was driving the fear was that the abundance of snakeheads
would get so high they would just overwhelm the system. That never
happened,” Odenkirk says. “They never got to the point where they could
threaten the stature of the bass, because there weren’t enough of
them.”</p>
<p>Odenkirk says snakeheads aren’t dominating their environment in part
because predators, including birds and other large fish, found them. And
he says the snakehead’s natural prey, including smaller fish,
instinctively adjusted to its presence.</p>
<p>The fish populations that snakeheads prey on have not declined, which
suggests the snakeheads aren’t having a negative impact on the
environment, Odenkirk adds.</p>
<p>The fish is also popular with anglers, which has also kept the
snakehead population in check. Their firm, mild-tasting white meat makes
them a sought-after delicacy.</p>
<p>“Like swimming chicken,” Sielicki says. “It’s the most hardiest piece
of meat that you’ll ever get.”</p>
<p>Despite this suppression, in the United States the snakehead
population has become most abundant in the Washington-area’s Potomac
River and its tributaries, and in the southern state of Arkansas, where
the fish used to be bred for food until 2002, when federal officials
banned the practice.</p>
<p>Even though snakeheads haven’t had a noticeably negative impact on
the ecosystem, wildlife officials aren’t prepared to give the invasive
species the all-clear.</p>
<p>“If they get in somewhere different, maybe where we have a
threatening or endangered fish, where there’s not as much diversity in
the fish community, there could be some unwanted impacts in a situation
like that,” Odenkirk says. “So, there’s still that hesitancy to sort of
embrace the fish all across the board.”</p>
<p>Years ago, worried wildlife officials advised people to kill
snakeheads if they caught them. But a recent state survey showed that
about 40% of people who catch this prized fish in Virginia now choose to
release it back in the wild.</p>
<p>But not Sielicki, who relishes harvesting his catch, which he does on
this morning after an hourslong lull, when the determined fisherman
finally hooks a 63-cm snakehead.</p>
<p>“Back up! We’re getting ready to put him in the boat,” he calls out.
“Let’s see if we can get another one.”</p>

Canada is warming at about twice the global rate, and the average
temperature during fire season last year was about 4 degrees Fahrenheit
higher than normal. The heat is triggering “flash droughts,” where the
ground dries out quickly and large areas of forest become easy kindling.
Extreme fire events like those in 2023 are likely to become more common
as the planet warms. Because forests absorb about 25% of the world’s
carbon emissions, the research suggests the world may need to reconsider
how the carbon budget is calculated.

<p>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/nuclear-energy-power" target="_self"><u>Nuclear
energy is making a comeback</u></a>, conceptually at least. While we’re
yet to see a whole lot of new steel in the ground, money is flowing into
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/fusion" target="_self"><u>fusion</u></a>,
there’s a push to build
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/the-nuclear-company-reactors" target="_self"><u>more
standard fission reactors</u></a>, and the dream of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/terrapower-bill-gates-nuclear" target="_self"><u>small
modular reactors</u></a> lives on, even in the wake of the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/nuscale-small-modular-reactor-nuclear-costs-inflation" target="_self"><u>NuScale
</u><u>disappointment</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
All this excitement generally revolves around nuclear’s potential to
provide clean, baseload power to the grid. But Washington D.C.-based
Last Energy is pursuing a different strategy — making
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/nuclear-microreactors-radiant-westinghouse-bwx-technologies" target="_self"><u>miniature,
modularized reactors</u></a> to provide power directly to industries
such as data centers, auto manufacturing, and pulp and paper production.
Size-wise, think small modular reactors, but, well, even smaller — Last
Energy’s units provide a mere 20 megawatts of electricity, whereas a
full-size reactor can be over 1,000 megawatts. SMRs sit somewhere in
between.
</p>
<p>
Today the company announced its $40 million series B round, led by the
Austin-based venture capital firm Gigafund. Last Energy aims to deploy
its first microreactor by 2026, and CEO and founder Bret Kugelmass told
me the company has already reached commercial agreements for 80 units,
all in Europe. Nearly half of these will be deployed at data centers,
the notoriously energy hungry server farms powering the AI boom.
</p>
<p>
Kugelmass told me the goal is for Last Energy’s reactor to be
transportable in the back of a truck. “We decided to focus most of our
specific design criteria based on supply chain and logistics
constraints,” he said. Every part of the system is “built in a factory,
first tested in a factory, mass manufactured in a factory, and then
snaps together like a Lego set out in the field.”
</p>
<p>
There are currently no operational microreactors anywhere in the Western
world, though other companies, including Radiant, Westinghouse, and BWX
Technologies are also trying to build one. Last Energy’s investors are
betting, however, that it could be one of the first to market.
</p>
<p>
As of now, the company has reached the permitting stage for some of its
European projects. Kugelmass told me that Wales, England, Poland, and
Romania are the company’s top markets, and that the decision to start in
Europe was mainly financial. “Energy is so expensive in Europe compared
to the U.S. — I mean, we’re talking like two, three times higher for the
exact same thing that we’re going to deliver. We can make two or three
times more money.”
</p>
<p>
The company estimates that its reactors can be fully manufactured and
assembled onsite within two years. And while Kugelmass wouldn’t reveal
an exact price, he said Last Energy will be cost-competitive with solar
or wind plus storage. Problem is, there’s not really any precedent that
would indicate how realistic these targets are, and nuclear doesn’t
exactly have the best track record when it comes to arriving on time or
on budget.
</p>
<p>
At the very least, though, Kugelmass told me the reactor’s smaller size
makes a meltdown “practically impossible,” meaning securing regulatory
approval should be much simpler than it is for full-size plants. And
building on the customer’s side of the meter also allows the company to
supply power before it’s officially grid-connected, meaning Last Energy
can work around the interminably long interconnection queues that plague
the European clean energy market just as they do the U.S.
</p>
<p>
As manufacturing ramps, costs come down, and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/advance-act-nuclear" target="_self"><u>streamlines
its process</u></a> for approving new projects, Kugelmass told me he
could see Last Energy entering the domestic market in a few years. After
all, with American companies driving the boom in AI and cloud computing,
the U.S. has far more data centers than anywhere else on earth. Last
Energy has aggressive plans to meet that demand, aiming to deploy 10,000
reactors in the next 15 years.
</p>
<p>
“But it doesn’t stop there, because that’s still only like 1% of global
energy,” Kugelmass told me, saying that Last Energy’s ultimate goal is
to “fundamentally transform global energy.” But that’s for tomorrow. For
the unglamorous now, some more prototypes and permits are in order.

Biden ‘looking forward’ to talks with Xi in coming weeks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Beijing — U.S. President Joe Biden is looking forward to talks with
Xi Jinping in the “coming weeks,” top White House aide Jake Sullivan
told the Chinese leader Thursday as they met for rare talks in
Beijing.</p>
<p>Sullivan, the first White House national security advisor to visit
China since 2016, met Xi as he wrapped up three days of talks in Beijing
which also saw him sit down with Foreign Minister Wang Yi and other
high-ranking officials.</p>
<p>His visit came as China was embroiled in security rows with US allies
Japan and the Philippines.</p>
<p>At a meeting with Xi in Beijing’s ornate Great Hall of the People
Thursday, he said President Biden “looks forward to engaging with you
again in the coming weeks.”</p>
<p>“President Biden is committed to responsibly managing this
consequential relationship to ensure that competition does not veer into
conflict or confrontation, and to work together where our interests
align,” he said.</p>
<p>Chinese state media said Xi told Sullivan that in spite of “great
changes,” China and the U.S. could still enjoy good ties.</p>
<p>“China’s commitment to the goal of stable, healthy, and sustainable
development of China-U.S. relations hasn’t changed,” Xi said.</p>
<p>“We hope that the U.S. will work with China to meet each other
halfway,” he added, according to CCTV.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Sullivan and top diplomat Wang discussed plans for
their leaders to talk in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>They also clashed over China’s increasingly assertive approach in
disputed maritime regions.</p>
<p>Taiwan ‘red line’</p>
<p>On Thursday morning, Sullivan met with senior Chinese army official
Zhang Youxia at the Beijing headquarters of the Central Military
Commission, where the two discussed Taiwan and other flashpoint
issues.</p>
<p>“It’s rare that we have the opportunity to have this kind of
exchange,” Sullivan told Zhang in opening remarks.</p>
<p>The officials agreed to hold a call between the two sides’ theatre
commanders “in the near future,” a readout from the White House
said.</p>
<p>Sullivan also raised the importance of “freedom of navigation” in the
South China Sea, where China and the Philippines have clashed in recent
months, and “stability” in the Taiwan Strait, Washington said.</p>
<p>Zhang, in turn, warned that the status of the self-ruled island was
“the first red line that cannot be crossed in China-U.S. relations”.</p>
<p>“China has always been committed to maintaining peace and stability
in the Taiwan Strait,” he said, according to a readout by Beijing’s
defense ministry.</p>
<p>“But ‘Taiwan independence’ and peace and stability in the Taiwan
Strait are incompatible,” he said.</p>
<p>“China demands that the U.S. halts military collusion with Taiwan,
ceases arming Taiwan, and stops spreading false narratives related to
Taiwan,” Zhang added.</p>
<p>He also asked Washington to “work with China to promote communication
and exchanges between the two militaries and jointly shoulder the
responsibilities of major powers”.</p>
<p>‘Avoid miscalculation’</p>
<p>China has kept up its sabre-rattling since the inauguration this year
of President Lai Ching-te, whose party emphasizes Taiwan’s separate
identity.</p>
<p>Thursday’s talks also saw Sullivan express “concerns about (Chinese)
support for Russia’s defense industrial base,” the readout added –
echoing longstanding US claims that Beijing has rejected.</p>
<p>He also raised “the need to avoid miscalculation and escalation in
cyber space, and ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage deal
in Gaza,” the White House said.</p>
<p>Sullivan’s visit comes months ahead of U.S. elections in
November.</p>
<p>The Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris,
would be expected, if she wins, to continue Biden’s approach of seeking
dialogue with China while also maintaining pressure.</p>
<p>Her Republican rival Donald Trump has vowed, at least rhetorically,
to take a harder line, with some of his aides seeing a far-reaching
global showdown with China.</p>

id="to-a-tiling-wm-user-apparently-other-guis-are-like-wearing-handcuffs">To
a tiling WM user, apparently other GUIs are like wearing handcuffs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-29, from: Liam on Linux</p>
 This is interesting to me. I am on the other side, and ISTM that the
tiling WM folks are the camp you describe.
<p>
Windows (2.01) was the 3rd GUI I learned. First was classic MacOS
(System 6 and early System 7.0), then Acorn RISC OS on my own home
computer, then Windows.
</p>
<p>
Both MacOS and RISC OS have beautiful, very mouse-centric GUIs where you
<i>must</i> use the mouse for most things. Windows was fascinating
because it has rich, well-thought-out, rational and consistent keyboard
controls, and they work everywhere. In all graphical apps, in the window
manager itself, <i>and on the command line</i>.
</p>
<p>
– Ctrl + a letter is a discrete action: <i>do this thing now</i>.
</p>
<p>
– Alt + a letter opens a menu
</p>
<p>
– Shift moves selects in a continuous range: shift+cursors selects text
or files in a file manager. Shift+mouse selects multiple icons in a
block in a file manager.
</p>
<p>
– Ctrl + mouse selects discontinuously: pick disconnected icons.
</p>
<p>
– These can be combined: shift-select a block, then press ctrl <i>as
well</i> to add some discontinuous entries.
</p>
<p>
– Ctrl + cursor keys moves a word at a time (discontinuous cursor
movement).
</p>
<p>
– Shift + ctrl selects a word at a time.
</p>
<p>
In the mid-’90s Linux made Unix affordable and I got to know it, and I
switched to it early ’00s.
</p>
<p>
But it lacks that overall cohesive keyboard UI. Some desktops implement
most of Windows’ keyboard UI (Xfce, LXDE, GNOME 2.x), some invent their
own (KDE), many don’t have one.
</p>
<p>
The shell and editors don’t have any consistency. Each editor has its
own set of keyboard controls, and some environments honour some of them
– but not many because the keyboard controls for an editor make little
sense in a window manager. What does "insert mode" mean in a file
manager?
</p>
<p>
They are keyboard-driven windowing environments built by people who live
in terminals and only know the extremely limited keyboard controls of
the most primitive extant shell environment, one that doesn’t honour GUI
keyboard UI because it predates it and so in which every app invents its
own.
</p>
<p>
Whereas Windows co-evolved with IBM CUA and deeply embeds it.
</p>
<p>
The result is that all the Linux tiling WMs I’ve tried annoy me, because
they don’t respect the existing Windows-based keystrokes for
manipulating windows. GNOME &gt;=3 mostly doesn’t either: keystrokes for
menu manipulation make little sense when you’ve tried to eliminate menus
from your UI.
</p>
<p>
Even the growing-in-trendiness MiracleWM because the developer doesn’t
use plain Ubuntu, he uses Kubuntu, and Kubuntu doesn’t respect basic
Ubuntu keystrokes like Ctrl+Alt+T for a terminal, so neither does
MiracleWM.
</p>
<p>
They are multiple non-overlapping, non-cohesive, non-uniform keyboard
UIs designed by and for people who never knew how to use a
keyboard-driven whole-OS UI because they didn’t know there was one. So
they all built their own ones without knowing that there’s 30+ years of
prior art for this.
</p>
<p>
All these little half-thought-out attempts to build something <i>that
already existed</i> but its creators didn’t know about it.
</p>
<p>
To extend the prisoners-escaping-jail theme:
</p>
<p>
Each only extends the one prisoner cell that inmate knew before they got
out, where the prison cell is an app – often a text editor but sometimes
it’s one game.
</p>
<p>
One environment lets you navigate by only going left or straight. To go
right, turn left three times! Simple!
</p>
<p>
One only lets you navigate in spirals, but you can adjust the size, and
toggle clockwise or anticlockwise.
</p>
<p>
One is like Asteroids: you pivot your cursor and apply thrust.
</p>
<p>
One uses Doom/Quake-style WASD + mouse, because everyone knows that,
right? It’s the standard!
</p>
<p>
One expects you to plug in a joypad controller and use that.

airspace intrusion a ‘wake-up call’ for Japan, US lawmaker says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TOKYO — The intrusion of a Chinese spy plane into Japanese airspace
is a “wake-up call” for Tokyo about the aggressive nature of China’s
leadership, U.S. lawmaker John Moolenaar, who chairs the House Select
Committee on China, said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The incident on Monday involving a Y-9 reconnaissance aircraft flying
near the southern Kyushu island was the first time a Chinese military
aircraft had breached Japan’s airspace, according to Tokyo, which told
Beijing it was “utterly unacceptable.”</p>
<p>The Chinese foreign ministry said Tuesday it was still trying to
understand the situation.</p>
<p>We’ve “seen a very different China in the last few years and the
question is what’s the best way to deter future aggression and malign
activity,” Moolenaar, who is a Republican member of the House of
Representatives, said in an interview in Tokyo on Wednesday.</p>
<p>His visit to Japan, with half a dozen members of a bipartisan
committee that has looked at topics ranging from China’s exports of
fentanyl precursor chemicals to Beijing’s influence over U.S.
businesses, comes as President Joe Biden’s administration looks to
expand restrictions on semiconductor manufacturing equipment
exports.</p>
<p>While Japan has worked with its U.S. ally to restrict shipments of
such technology, unlike Washington it has avoided trade curbs that
directly target its neighbor and largest trading partner.</p>
<p>A new rule that will broaden U.S. powers to halt semiconductor
manufacturing equipment exports to China from some foreign chipmakers
will exclude Japan, the Netherlands and South Korea, two sources told
Reuters last month.</p>
<p>In Japan, Moolenaar met trade and industry minister Ken Saito, who
oversees Japan’s technology exports and is meeting with the Prime
Minister Fumio Kishida and other senior Japanese officials.</p>
<p>“The question is what’s the best way to deter future (Chinese)
aggression and malign activity. We don’t want to feed into a military
complex that can be used against us,” Moolenaar said.</p>

elephant calf in 2 weeks is born at California zoo</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>FRESNO, Calif. — The second elephant calf in two weeks has been born
at a California zoo.</p>
<p>African elephant Amahle gave birth early Monday morning, according to
the Fresno Chaffee Zoo. The event came 10 days after Amahle’s mother,
Nolwazi, gave birth to another male calf.</p>
<p>The new additions are the first elephants born at the zoo, about 240
kilometers southeast of San Francisco, which has embarked on a program
to breed elephants in the hope that they can be seen by zoogoers in
years to come.</p>
<p>“To have two healthy calves is a historic milestone,” Jon Forrest
Dohlin, the zoo’s chief executive, said in a statement Tuesday. “We
cannot wait for the public to see the new additions to our herd and
share in our excitement.”</p>
<p>The elephants and their calves will continue to be monitored behind
the scenes for now, Dohlin said. While the zoo expanded its exhibit in
anticipation of growing its herd, some animal activists have opposed the
breeding program, saying elephants shouldn’t be in zoos because of their
complex needs.</p>
<p>In 2022, the zoo brought in male elephant Mabu hoping he’d breed with
the two females. The future of elephants — which have relatively few
offspring and a 22-month gestation period — in zoos hinges largely on
breeding.</p>

id="us-to-finalize-significant-tariffs-on-selected-chinese-imports">US
to finalize significant tariffs on selected Chinese imports</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STATE DEPARTMENT — The White House says U.S. officials continue to
raise concerns about what they describe as unfair trade policies and
non-market economic practices by the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration is expected to
unveil its final implementation plans for substantial tariff increases
on selected Chinese imports in the coming days.</p>
<p>Some U.S. manufacturers, however, including those in the electric
vehicle and utility equipment sectors, have requested that the higher
tariff rates be reduced or delayed, citing concerns about rising
cost.</p>
<p>On May 14, the White House announced a significant increase in
tariffs on Chinese imports, raising duties on electric vehicles to 100%,
doubling tariffs on semiconductors and solar cells to 50%, and
introducing new 25% tariffs on lithium-ion batteries and other strategic
products such as steel.</p>
<p>The move is seen as an effort to reshore U.S. manufacturing, enhance
supply chain resilience, and protect domestic U.S. industries from what
officials described as China’s overproduction.</p>
<p>This week, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi during their talks near Beijing that
Washington will continue to take necessary actions to prevent advanced
U.S. technologies from being used to undermine national security, while
avoiding undue limitations on trade or investment.</p>
<p>In Beijing, China has vowed to take countermeasures.</p>
<p>Wang this week accused the U.S. of using overcapacity as an excuse
for “protectionism.” He urged the U.S. to “stop suppressing China in the
economic, trade, and technological fields and to stop undermining
China’s legitimate interests.”</p>
<p>Sullivan and Wang have discussed arranging a call between Biden and
Chinese President Xi Jinping in the coming weeks. Disputes over trade
and tariffs are expected to be among the issues on the agenda.</p>
<p>Former U.S. officials told VOA that the leaders also are likely to
have face-to-face talks before Biden leaves office next January.</p>
<p>“The first opportunity is the APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation) leaders’ summit in November, and the second is the G20
summit in November,” Ryan Haas, a former NSC senior official from 2013
to 2017 and currently a senior fellow at the Washington-based Brookings
Institution, told VOA on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Some analysts have downplayed the likelihood of immediate inflation,
noting that the tariff increases announced in May target a relatively
small portion of products — $18 billion in imports from China, which
accounts for only 4.2% of all U.S. imports from China in 2023.</p>
<p>“Because many of the tariffs affect products that are not currently
being imported in large quantities, and because they are phased in over
two years, the immediate inflationary effect is likely to be small,”
wrote William Reinsch, the Scholl Chair in International Business at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, in a CSIS analysis
earlier this year.</p>
<p>This week, following the Biden administration’s May announcement,
Canada said that it will impose a 100% tariff on Chinese electric
vehicle imports and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports from
China, effective Oct. 1.</p>
<p>In Beijing, China’s Commerce Ministry issued a statement expressing
strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to Canada’s planned tariff
increases, stating that they would disrupt the stability of global
industrial and supply chains, severely impact trade relations, and harm
the interests of businesses in both countries.</p>
<p>Some material in this report came from Reuters.</p>

<h2 id="release-announcement-barman-3.11.1-and-3.11.0">Release
Announcement Barman 3.11.1 and 3.11.0</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-29, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com">EDB</a> is pleased to announce
the release of Barman 3.11.1 and 3.11.0.
</p>
<h2>
Highlights of this release:
</h2>
<h3>
Version 3.11.1 - 22 August 2024
</h3>
<h3>
Bug fixes:
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Fix failures in
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;barman-cloud-backup-delete&lt;code&gt;</code></code>.
This command was failing when applying retention policies due to a bug
introduced by the previous release.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Version 3.11.0 - 22 August 2024
</h3>
<h4>
Features:
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Add support for Postgres 17+ incremental backups. This major feature is
composed of several small changes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Add <code><code>&lt;/code&gt;--incremental&lt;code&gt;</code></code>
command-line option to
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;barman backup&lt;code&gt;</code></code>
command. This is used to specify the parent backup when taking an
incremental backup. The parent can be either a full backup or another
incremental backup.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Add <code><code>&lt;/code&gt;latest-full&lt;code&gt;</code></code>
shortcut backup ID. Along with
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;latest&lt;code&gt;</code></code>, this can be
used as a shortcut to select the parent backup for an incremental
backup. While <code><code>&lt;/code&gt;latest&lt;code&gt;</code></code>
takes the latest backup independently if it is full or incremental,
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;latest-full&lt;code&gt;</code></code> takes the
latest full backup.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;barman keep&lt;code&gt;</code></code> command
can only be applied to full backups when
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;backup_method = postgres&lt;code&gt;</code></code>.
If a full backup has incremental backups that depend on it, all of the
incrementals are also kept by Barman.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
When deleting a backup all the incremental backups depending on it, if
any, are also removed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Retention policies do not take incremental backups into consideration.
As incremental backups cannot be recovered without having the complete
chain of backups available up to the full backup, only full backups
account for retention policies.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;barman recover&lt;code&gt;</code></code> needs
to combine the full backup with the chain of incremental backups when
recovering. The new CLI option
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;--local-staging-path&lt;code&gt;</code></code>,
and the corresponding
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;local_staging_path&lt;code&gt;</code></code>
configuration option, are used to specify the path in the Barman host
where the backups will be combined when recovering an incremental
backup.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Changes to
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;barman show-backup&lt;code&gt;</code></code>
output:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Add the “Estimated cluster size” field. It’s useful to have an
estimation of the data directory size of a cluster when restoring a
backup. It’s particularly useful when recovering compressed backups or
incremental backups, situations where the size of the backup doesn’t
reflect the size of the data directory in Postgres. In JSON format, this
is stored as
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;cluster_size&lt;code&gt;</code></code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Add the “WAL summarizer” field. This field shows if
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;summarize_wal&lt;code&gt;</code></code> was
enabled in Postgres at the time the backup was taken. In JSON format,
this is stored as
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;server_information.summarize_wal&lt;code&gt;</code></code>.
This field is omitted for Postgres 16 and older.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Add “Data checksums” field. This shows if
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;data_checkums&lt;code&gt;</code></code> was
enabled in Postgres at the time the backup was taken. In JSON format,
this is stored as
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;server_information.data_checksums&lt;code&gt;</code></code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Add the “Backup method” field. This shows the backup method used for
this backup. In JSON format, this is stored as
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;base_backup_information.backup_method&lt;code&gt;</code></code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Rename the field “Disk Usage” as “Backup Size”. The latter provides a
more comprehensive name which represents the size of the backup in the
Barman host. The JSON field under
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;base_backup_information&lt;code&gt;</code></code>
was also renamed from
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;disk_usage&lt;code&gt;</code></code> to
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;backup_size&lt;code&gt;</code></code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Add the “WAL size” field. This shows the size of the WALs required by
the backup. In JSON format, this is stored as
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;base_backup_information.wal_size&lt;code&gt;</code></code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Refactor the field “Incremental size”. It is now named “Resources
saving” and it now shows an estimation of resources saved when taking
incremental backups with
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;rsync&lt;code&gt;</code></code> or
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;pg_basebackup&lt;code&gt;</code></code>. It
compares the backup size with the estimated cluster size to estimate the
amount of disk and network resources that were saved by taking an
incremental backup. In JSON format, the field was renamed from
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;incremental_size&lt;code&gt;</code></code> to
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;resource_savings&lt;code&gt;</code></code>
under
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;base_backup_information&lt;code&gt;</code></code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Add the <code><code>&lt;/code&gt;system_id&lt;code&gt;</code></code>
field to the JSON document. This field contains the system identifier of
Postgres. It was present in console format, but was missing in JSON
format.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Add fields related with Postgres incremental backups:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
“Backup type”: indicates if the Postgres backup is full or incremental.
In JSON format, this is stored as
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;backup_type&lt;code&gt;</code></code> under
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;base_backup_information&lt;code&gt;</code></code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
“Root backup”: the ID of the full backup that is the root of a chain of
one or more incremental backups. In JSON format, this is stored as
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;catalog_information.root_backup_id&lt;code&gt;</code></code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
“Parent backup”: the ID of the full or incremental backup from which
this incremental backup was taken. In JSON format, this is stored as
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;catalog_information.parent_backup_id&lt;code&gt;</code></code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
“Children Backup(s)”: the IDs of the incremental backups that were taken
with this backup as the parent. In JSON format, this is stored as
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;catalog_information.children_backup_ids&lt;code&gt;</code></code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
“Backup chain size”: the number of backups in the chain from this
incremental backup up to the root backup. In JSON format, this is stored
as
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;catalog_information.chain_size&lt;code&gt;</code></code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Changes to
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;barman list-backup&lt;code&gt;</code></code>
output:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
It now includes the backup type in the JSON output, which can be either
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;rsync&lt;code&gt;</code></code> for backups
taken with rsync,
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;full&lt;code&gt;</code></code> or
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;incremental&lt;code&gt;</code></code> for
backups taken with
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;pg_basebackup&lt;code&gt;</code></code>, or
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;snapshot&lt;code&gt;</code></code> for cloud
snapshots. When printing to the console the backup type is represented
by the corresponding labels
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;R&lt;code&gt;</code></code>,
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;F&lt;code&gt;</code></code>,
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;I&lt;code&gt;</code></code> or
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;S&lt;code&gt;</code></code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Remove tablespaces information from the output. That was bloating the
output. Tablespaces information can still be found in the output of
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;barman show-backup&lt;code&gt;</code></code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Always set a timestamp with a time zone when configuring
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;recovery_target_time&lt;code&gt;</code></code>
through
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;barman recover&lt;code&gt;</code></code>.
Previously, if no time zone was explicitly set through
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;--target-time&lt;code&gt;</code></code>, Barman
would configure
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;recovery_target_time&lt;code&gt;</code></code>
without a time zone in Postgres. Without a time zone, Postgres would
assume whatever is configured through
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;timezone&lt;code&gt;</code></code> GUC in
Postgres. From now on Barman will issue a warning and configure
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;recovery_target_time&lt;code&gt;</code></code>
with the time zone of the Barman host if no time zone is set by the user
through <code><code>&lt;/code&gt;--target-time&lt;code&gt;</code></code>
option.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
When recovering a backup with the “no get wal” approach and
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;--target-lsn&lt;code&gt;</code></code> is set,
copy only the WAL files required to reach the configured target.
Previously Barman would copy all the WAL files from its archive to
Postgres.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
When recovering a backup with the “no get wal” approach and
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;--target-immediate&lt;code&gt;</code></code> is
set, copy only the WAL files required to reach the consistent point.
Previously Barman would copy all the WAL files from its archive to
Postgres.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;barman-wal-restore&lt;code&gt;</code></code>
now moves WALs from the spool directory to
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;pg_wal&lt;code&gt;</code></code> instead of
copying them. This can improve performance if the spool directory and
the <code><code>&lt;/code&gt;pg_wal&lt;code&gt;</code></code> directory
are in the same partition.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;barman check-backup&lt;code&gt;</code></code>
now shows the reason why a backup was marked as
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;FAILED&lt;code&gt;</code></code> in the output
and logs. Previously for a user to know why the backup was marked as
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;FAILED&lt;code&gt;</code></code>, they would
need to run
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;barman show-backup&lt;code&gt;</code></code>
command.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Add configuration option
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;aws_await_snapshots_timeout&lt;code&gt;</code></code>
and the corresponding
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;--aws-await-snapshots-timeout&lt;code&gt;</code></code>
command-line option on
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;barman-cloud-backup&lt;code&gt;</code></code>.
This specifies the timeout in seconds to wait for snapshot backups to
reach the completed state.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Add a keep-alive mechanism to rsync-based backups. Previously the
Postgres session created by Barman to run
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;pg_backup_start()&lt;code&gt;</code></code> and
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;pg_backup_stop()&lt;code&gt;</code></code>
would stay idle for as long as the base backup copy would take. That
could lead to a firewall or router dropping the connection because it
was idle for a long time. The keep-alive mechanism sends heartbeat
queries to Postgres through that connection, thus reducing the
likelihood of a connection getting dropped. The interval between
heartbeats can be controlled through the new configuration option
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;keepalive_interval&lt;code&gt;</code></code>
and the corresponding CLI option
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;--keepalive-interval&lt;code&gt;</code></code>
of the <code><code>&lt;/code&gt;barman backup&lt;code&gt;</code></code>
command.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Bug fixes:
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
When recovering a backup with the “no get wal” approach and
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;--target-time&lt;code&gt;</code></code> set,
copy all WAL files. Previously Barman would attempt to “guess” the WAL
files required by Postgres to reach the configured target time. However,
the mechanism was not robust enough as it was based on the stats of the
WAL file in the Barman host (more specifically the creation time). For
example: if there were archiving or streaming lag between Postgres and
Barman, that could be enough for recovery to fail because Barman would
miss to copy all the required WAL files due to the weak check based on
file stats.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Pin <code><code>&lt;/code&gt;python-snappy&lt;code&gt;</code></code> to
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;0.6.1&lt;code&gt;</code></code> when running
Barman through Python 3.6 or older. Newer versions of
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;python-snappy&lt;code&gt;</code></code> require
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;cramjam&lt;code&gt;</code></code> version
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;2.7.0&lt;code&gt;</code></code> or newer, and
these are only available for Python 3.7 or newer.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;barman receive-wal&lt;code&gt;</code></code>
now exits with code <code><code>&lt;/code&gt;1&lt;code&gt;</code></code>
instead of <code><code>&lt;/code&gt;0&lt;code&gt;</code></code> in the
following cases:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Being unable to run with
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;--reset&lt;code&gt;</code></code> flag because
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;pg_receivewal&lt;code&gt;</code></code> is
running.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Being unable to start
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;pg_receivewal&lt;code&gt;</code></code> process
because it is already running.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fix and improve information about Python in
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;barman diagnose&lt;code&gt;</code></code>
output:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The command now makes sure to use the same Python interpreter under
which Barman is installed when outputting the Python version through
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;python_ver&lt;code&gt;</code></code> JSON key.
Previously, if an environment had multiple Python installations and/or
virtual environments, the output could eventually be misleading, as it
could be fetched from a different Python interpreter.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added a
<code><code>&lt;/code&gt;python_executable&lt;code&gt;</code></code> key
to the JSON output. That contains the path to the exact Python
interpreter being used by Barman.
</p>
