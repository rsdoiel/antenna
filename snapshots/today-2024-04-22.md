## 23 Apr 2024

date: 2024-04-24, from: Miguel de Icaza's blog

<h1 id="embeddable-game-engine">Embeddable Game Engine</h1>
<p><img
src="https://migueldeicaza.github.io/SwiftGodotDocs/images/SwiftGodot%20Header.png"
align="right" width=240>
Many years ago, when working at Xamarin, where we were building cross-platform
libraries for mobile developers, we wanted to offer both 2D and 3D gaming
capabilities for our users in the form of adding 2D or 3D content to their
mobile applications.</p>
<p>For 2D, we contributed and developed assorted Cocos2D-inspired libraries.</p>
<p>For 3D, the situation was more complex. We funded a few over the years, and we
contributed to others over the years, but nothing panned out (the
history of this is worth a dedicated post).</p>
<p>Around 2013, we looked around, and there were two contenders at the
time, one was an embeddable engine with many cute features but not great UI
support called Urho, and the other one was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godot_(game_engine)">Godot</a>, which had a great IDE, but
did not support being embedded.</p>
<p>I reached out to Juan at the time to discuss whether Godot could be turned into
such engine.   While I tend to take copious notes of all my meetings, those
notes sadly were gone as part of the Microsoft acquisition, but from what I can
remember Juan told me, &quot;Godot is not what you are looking for&quot; in two dimensions,
there were no immediate plans to turn it into an embeddable library, and it was
not as advanced as Urho, so he recommended that I go with Urho.</p>
<p>We invested heavily in binding Urho and created
<a href="https://github.com/xamarin/urho">UrhoSharp</a> that would go into becoming a <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/xamarin/bring-3d-models-life-augmented-reality-urhosharp/">great
3D library for our C# users</a> and worked not only on every desktop and mobile
platform, but we did a ton of work to make it great for AR and VR headsets.
Sadly, Microsoft's management left UrhoSharp to die.</p>
<p>Then, the maintainer of Urho stepped down, and Godot became one of the most
popular open-source projects in the world.</p>
<p>Last year, @Faolan-Rad <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/72883">contributed a patch to Godot</a> to turn it into a library
that could be embedded into applications.   I used this library to build
<a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftGodotKit">SwiftGodotKit</a> and have been
very happy with it ever since - allowing people to embed Godot content into
their application.</p>
<p>However, the patch had severe limitations; it could only ever run one Godot game as
an embedded system and could not do much more.   The folks at <a href="https://www.smirk.gg">Smirk
Software</a> wanted to take this further. They wanted to host
independent Godot scenes in their app and have more control over those so
they could sprinkle Godot content at their heart's content on their mobile app (<a href="https://x.com/JoshBromberg1/status/1721564103859114132">demo</a>)</p>
<p>They funded some initial work to do this and hired <a href="https://migeran.com">Gergely
Kis's company</a> to do this work.</p>
<p>Gergely demoed this work at GodotCon last year.   I came back very excited from
GodotCon and I decided to turn my <a href="https://x.com/migueldeicaza/status/1723765594653167892">prototype Godot on iPad</a> into a <a href="https://blog.la-terminal.net/igodot/">complete
product</a>.</p>
<p>One of the features that I needed was the ability to embed chunks of Godot in
discrete components in my iPad UI, so we worked with Gergely to productize and
polish this patch for general consumption.</p>
<p>Now, there is a <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/90510">complete patch under review</a> to allow people to embed arbitrary
Godot scenes into their apps.   For SwiftUI users, this means that you can embed a Godot scene into a <code>View</code> and display and control it at will.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the team will accept this change into Godot, and once this is done, I will
update SwiftGodotKit to get these new capabilities to Swift users (bindings for
other platforms and languages are left as an exercise to the reader).</p>
<p>It only took a decade after talking to Juan, but I am back firmly in Godot land.</p>

Most internet travels by wire. Straight through the dang ocean. Josh Dzieza in a feature for The Verge: These fragile wires are constantly breaking — a precarious system on which everything from banks to governments to TikTok depends. But thanks to a secretive global network of ships on standby, every broken cable is quickly fixed. [&#8230;]

The system is behind technologically and plagued by a constant challenge among government and nonprofit tech platforms: the lack of highly skilled engineers, who can get paid far higher salaries in the tech industry. Sometimes those employees are even poached by the same companies that send in the reports.

## Paying for it doesn’t make it a market

date: 2024-04-22, from: OS News

Cory Doctorow, nailing it as usual. If you care about how people are treated by platforms, you can&#8217;t just tell them to pay for services instead of using ad-supported media. The most important factor in getting decent treatment out of a tech company isn&#8217;t whether you pay with cash instead of attention – it&#8217;s whether you&#8217;re locked in, and thus a flight risk whom the platform must cater to. ↫ Cory Doctorow I&#8217;m sick and tired of the phrase &#8220;if you&#8217;re not paying for the product, you&#8217;re the product&#8221;, because it implies that if just you pay for a product or service, you&#8217;re not going to be treated like ass. The problem is, as Doctorow points out, that this simply is not supported by the evidence, and that it isn&#8217;t whether or not you&#8217;re paying that makes you have a good or bad experience &#8211; it&#8217;s whether or not you&#8217;re locked in. If you&#8217;ve got nowhere else to go, then corporations can treat you like ass. There are so, so many free services and products I use where I&#8217;m anything but a &#8220;product&#8221;. My Linux distribution of choice, Fedora. My web browser, Firefox. The countless open source applications I use on my desktops, laptops, and smartphone. Those are all cases where even though I&#8217;m not paying, I know I&#8217;m being treated with respect, and I feel entirely comfortable with all of those. And no, you don&#8217;t get to exclude the open source world just because it&#8217;s inconvenient for the &#8220;you&#8217;re the product&#8221; argument. There are also countless services and products where the opposite is true; I&#8217;m a paying customer, but I still feel like I&#8217;m the product. I pay for additional Google Drive storage. I pay for an Office 364 subscription because I needed it as a translator (I&#8217;m working on OSNews full-time now, and could use your help keeping the site going), but I can&#8217;t cancel it because my wife, my parents, and my parents-in-law use that same subscription. We pay for Netflix and one or two other video services. I don&#8217;t know if our ISP or wireless provider do anything malicious, but it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me. And so on. Being a paying customer means nothing. It&#8217;s how easy it is for you to stop being a customer that matters.

It all depends on who you ask — and, especially, how.</p><p>In March, as it has since 1939, Gallup asked Americans what they thought was the <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/Most-Important-Problem.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>most important problem</u></a> facing the country. Just 2% of respondents said “environment/pollution/climate change” — fewer than those who said “poor leadership” or “unifying the country” (although more than those who said “the media.”) <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/02/29/americans-top-policy-priority-for-2024-strengthening-the-economy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Pew, meanwhile</u></a>, asked Americans in January what the top priority for the president and Congress ought to be for this year, and “dealing with climate change” ranked third-to-last out of 20 issues — well behind “defending against terrorism,” “reducing availability of illegal drugs,” and “improving the way the political system works.” </p><p>The Biden administration seems to be taking the apparent message to heart, <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/epa-rules-biden" target="_self"><u>softening parts of its climate agenda</u></a> while Democrats in tight elections run interference with their economy-first constituents. Mention of the Inflation Reduction Act, the president’s landmark climate legislation, still <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/inflation-reduction-act-popularity-repeal" target="_self"><u>mostly elicits blank stares from Americans</u></a>, and the administration hasn’t done much to help its case. During his State of the Union address, Biden didn’t refer to the IRA <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-state-of-the-union-inflation-reduction-act" target="_self"><u>by name</u></a> even once.</p><p>And yet Americans clearly, obviously, patently<em><em> are </em></em>worried about the climate. More than half of the respondents to <a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a Yale Program on Climate Change opinion poll</u></a> last winter said “global warming should be a priority for the next president and Congress.” Around the same time, seven in 10 called climate change a “serious issue” and a third reported being “extremely concerned” about it in <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/change-polling-concern-belief-republicans-vs-democrats" target="_self"><u>Heatmap’s own Climate Poll</u></a>. </p><p>“You could also ask, ‘Is the survival of American democracy a defining issue in this campaign or not?,’ and the polls will sometimes mislead you into thinking it’s way down the list,” former Vice President Al Gore said at a recent leadership conference for his nonprofit Climate Reality Project in New York — and indeed <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/Most-Important-Problem.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the March Gallup poll from March</u></a> had “elections/election reform/democracy” as the top issue facing the country for just 3% of people. “But when people get into the voting booth,” Gore continued, “and they think about the fact that democracy is at risk — as we saw in the last bye elections — that actually <em><em>did</em></em> matter. And I think climate is the same way.”</p><p>Gore wasn’t just relying on his own intuition. A widely circulated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/18/us/politics/midterm-election-voters-democracy-poll.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em>New York Times</em>/Siena College poll</u></a> conducted ahead of the 2022 midterms showed 71% of voters believed democracy was at risk, but only 7% identified it as the most important issue facing the country, leading many to start <a href="https://twitter.com/billmckibben/status/1582505214229172224" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>eulogizing</u></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/maddow/status/1582396824517677057" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>American</u></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/donmoyn/status/1582361649310154753" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>democracy</u></a>. And yet candidates from the Democratic Party, which has positioned itself as a bulwark against the erosion of representative government, dominated the most contested elections.</p><p>When you start to ask more targeted questions, the research tends to concur. “If you say, ‘Is climate change <em><em>an</em></em> important priority?,’ you get about two-thirds of people who agree with that,” Matthew Burgess, an assistant professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado Boulder, told me. “If you say, ‘<em><em>the single most important</em></em> issue,’ then that’s where it falls off.” </p><p>Burgess’s work has examined a particularly odd discrepancy between the limited number of voters who list climate as the most urgent issue facing the country and the fact that climate change, on its own, can seemingly swing elections. In fact, Burgess and his co-authors argued <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/asmagazine/2024/03/19/putting-climate-ballot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in a paper</u></a> they published earlier this year that climate voters might have secured Biden's 2020 victory. Using data from the nonpartisan Voter Study Group, Burgess and his co-authors found that “how important voters considered climate change to be as an issue was one of the strongest predictors of whom they voted for in 2020.” How strong a predictor? Strong enough to shift the national popular vote margin by 3% or more toward Biden, they concluded.</p><p>But when I asked Burgess what’s missing from a statistic like Gallup’s, which shows few voters prioritizing climate over other concerns, he admitted, “I don’t know.” He has plenty of theories, though. Recent election margins have been <a href="https://theconversation.com/climate-change-matters-to-more-and-more-people-and-could-be-a-deciding-factor-in-the-2024-election-222680" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>so tight</u></a> that climate change would not actually have to have a significant effect on voting to swing the outcome, he told me. Or perhaps voters are beginning to connect the dots between climate change and issues they more openly profess to care about, such as the economy and <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/National_Security_Implications_of_Changing_Climate_Final_051915.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>national security</u></a>. When I asked Justin McCarthy, an analyst at Gallup, about Burgess’ findings, he told me that “our question is not meant to measure issues affecting vote choice.”</p><p>It takes a lot of faith to buy any of those arguments, and Democrats in tight <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/8-climate-races-election-2024" target="_self"><u>down-ballot races</u></a> might not be willing to bet their limited resources on it. But we risk blowing past important context by writing off polling that shows Americans putting the economy over their concern about climate change, according to Emily Becker, the deputy director of communications on the climate and energy team at Third Way, a center-left think tank.</p><p>Becker has no problem advising frontline candidates “not to talk about climate and to talk about clean energy instead,” she told me. In her opinion, the two are separate issues — and the popular habit of using them as euphemisms is helping neither voters nor climate-conscious candidates.</p><p>“We tend to talk about clean energy as having one core purpose: emissions abatement. Then there are the positive externalities: job creation, clean air and water, money into your community, etc.,” Becker told me. But when it comes to Americans struggling to pay their bills, or who see minimal opportunities for good, well-paying jobs in their communities, “the positive externalities are no longer side effects,” she said. “They’re the main piece.”</p><p>By way of example, Becker said, it’s especially telling that investing in clean energy to address climate change appears to be popular in polls, but follow-up questions that ask how voters would feel about that investment <em><em>if it raises their household costs </em></em>see a “big drop.” “It’s kind of a luxury issue,” Becker said of climate change-first voting. <a href="https://www.thirdway.org/polling/beyond-the-climate-voter-how-to-broaden-support-for-clean-energy-in-america" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Third Way’s own research</u></a> shows that people who self-identify that way tend to be older, white, and more educated. </p><p>But young voters — traditionally thought of as the most climate-friendly demographic — are also facing some of the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90830832/gen-z-hardest-economic-challenges-experts" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>worst economic odds of any living generation</u></a>. “The idea that you’re going to make decisions at the ballot box based on a faraway problem and not based on the problems right in front of you is a little bit delusional,” Becker told me.</p><p>Heather Hargreaves, the deputy executive director of campaigns at Climate Power, a strategic communications group with <a href="https://climatepower.us/research-and-polling/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a robust research and polling operation</u></a>, had a slightly different takeaway. “I don’t think any elected official who is seeing a national poll where climate change is getting a lower percentage than the economy should be like, ‘Oh, this means I shouldn’t talk about climate change,’” she told me. “That’s misguided.”</p><p>Climate Power’s polling has <a href="https://climatepower.us/news/memo-poll-post-super-tuesday-democrats-must-emphasize-trumps-record/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>found</u></a> that “clean energy and climate messaging” moved every demographic toward Biden, particularly — again — young voters, as well as independents, who were key in Burgess’ research. “If you look at the things people care about the most, gas prices and utility costs are always up there,” Hargreaves said. “And these are both related to how we address climate change.”</p><p>As even more evidence that climate is a winning message after all, Hargreaves pointed out that Republicans in red districts are “not shying away” from talking about how the IRA has brought money, improvements, and clean-energy investments to their districts. For example, Senator Tom Cotton bragged last summer that “Senator Boozman and I were able to secure the grants” for highway improvement projects funded by the infrastructure law — which <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/07/09/gop-spending-infrastructure-ira-biden/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the Arkansas pair had voted against</u></a>. Likewise, Nancy Mace, a congresswoman from South Carolina, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/173963/republicans-taking-credit-infrastructure-bill-voted-against" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hosted a press conference</u></a> touting a local transit hub with electric buses despite having once called electric mass transit “socialism.”</p><p>“They’re now trying to take credit for it — and that’s proof it’s politically a winner,” Hargreaves told me.</p><p>As an election-year message, it’s hard to argue that “climate change” — at least phrased as such — <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/09/08/1198525628/are-the-effects-of-extreme-weather-changing-how-were-thinking-about-climate-chan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>actually resonates</u></a> with the majority of Americans. But “it must be a big tent issue if we’re going to actually solve it,” Burgess, the University of Colorado Boulder professor, told me. And opinions are still being shaped: Gallup has found that victims of extreme weather events are <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/391508/extreme-weather-affected-one-three-americans.aspx#:~:text=Gallup's%20annual%20Environment%20survey%20tracks,in%20the%20past%20two%20years." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more likely</u></a> to worry about climate change and view it as a threat. As Hargreaves stressed to me, polling <em><em>trends</em></em> tend to be more revealing than any individual battery questions, and they generally show <a href="https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/global-surveys-show-peoples-growing-concern-about-climate-change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>growing levels of urgency</u></a>.</p><p>Becker also offered a word of advice. “Be willing to be told that your issue does not matter as much as you want it to,” she said. “And figure out how you can make your priorities and the priorities of the electorate overlap.”</p>

## Cannabis a rare consensus issue ahead of US election

date: 2024-04-22, from: VOA News USA

washington  — Marijuana use is a rare consensus issue in politically divided America, with polls showing that 88% of Americans support at least partial legalization. But neither of the two main presidential contenders are capitalizing on this, advocates say, with both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump landing far behind where most Americans are on the issue.


VOA spoke to cannabis advocates on the sidelines of a rare, recent policy summit on the issue, held annually in Washington as a preview to a weekend-long music festival.


“One thing [both candidates] have in common is that their track records on cannabis have been inconsistent and incremental,” said Caroline Phillips, organizer of the National Cannabis Policy Summit. “We've heard promises from both administrations, neither of which have panned out in full.”


Biden in 2022 directed the Department of Health and Human Services to take a key step toward legalization by ordering a review of its classification of marijuana as a dangerous controlled substance, on par with heroin and LSD.


Nearly a year later, the body recommended moving marijuana to a lighter classification, alongside prescription drugs. That ruling now sits with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which has the power to act.


But, Phillips said, many advocates seek the full removal – or “de-scheduling” – of the substance from the DEA’s Controlled Substances Act.


“They have given us great signals that they're willing to shift towards de-scheduling, but most likely re-scheduling,” she said of the Biden administration. “However, we haven't quite seen the action to back up their words.”


Re-scheduling puts marijuana on par with prescription drugs and regulates users’ access to it; de-scheduling removes it from the list of controlled substances entirely.




Neera Tanden, director of Biden’s Domestic Policy Council, said the administration sees a need to learn more – something that re-scheduling the substance would enable by making it more readily available to scientific researchers.


“There's been a lot of change on this issue for several years,” she told VOA. “It's important for us to be able to research it more effectively.”


A small but vocal group of anti-cannabis legislators in Congress have also expressed concerns about changing the status of marijuana. Last year, 14 of them – all Republicans – sent a letter opposing the effort to loosen its classification.


In their letter, the group pointed to the potential for addiction and the increased potency of today’s cannabis, saying “facts indicate that marijuana has a high potential for abuse and that the risk is only increasing.”


Trump’s position on marijuana, advocates say, is hazy. The pro-legalization Marijuana Policy Project says he “never brought the issue up proactively” as president. Since leaving office, Phillips said, “we've heard him both say that people who sell drugs in the illicit market should be jailed and even put to death.”


On the campaign trail, Trump has largely avoided the issue, said Morgan Fox, political director for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, known as NORML.


“We haven't heard too much from the Republican nominee so far,” he said.


The personal becomes political


The candidates’ attitudes, Fox said, are out of step with those of many Americans, and lean on old tropes about marijuana that paint users as prone to mania – like in the 1936 film “Reefer Madness” – or use fear as a tool, like the 1980s-era Drug Abuse Resistance Education program.


"Luckily, with the advent of the internet and the development of a lot more communication around these issues, people have not only been able to see that the policy of prohibiting cannabis and criminalizing cannabis consumers is nonsensical, but they've also been able to really see the human impact that it has had,” he said.




For entrepreneur William Davis, this is personal. With his pressed jeans, alligator-skin boots, crisp white cowboy hat and penchant for replying to questions with “yes, ma’am,” he knows he does not cut the figure of a stereotypical cannabis user.


“It's a lot of people that you would never think,” he said.


For years, the Iraq war veteran struggled with PTSD and opioid addiction. He was reluctant to accept a friend’s recommendation that he try cannabis, he said, because to him it evoked a wildly popular 1980s ad that showed a frying egg, and a stern admonition: “This is your brain on drugs.”


“Like in a hot pan with the egg, I thought, ‘Nah, I don’t wanna try drugs, I’m gonna fry my brains,’” Davis said.


Instead, he said, marijuana produced a revelation. Davis says he uses CBD, the non-psychoactive compound found in marijuana, to soothe his anxiety during the day, and the active component, THC, for relaxation after work.


Six years ago, he founded a company, Euphoria Eats, that sells infused hot sauce and barbecue sauce.



Davis, who is from Houston but now lives in solidly Republican Louisiana, said he supports legalization for business reasons.


“Until this will be decriminalized and legal everywhere, there will always be hesitant individuals who are afraid to put their money into a lucrative business that they see is making money, that they see is making an impact on the community,” he told VOA.


'My vote influences cannabis laws'


Polls show that the greatest pro-cannabis momentum comes from younger Americans.


Community organizer Scotty Smart spoke to VOA about his position as a young progressive, which was summarized neatly on his moss-green T-shirt that read: “MY VOTE INFLUENCES CANNABIS LAWS.”


“I think cannabis is an issue that ignites and excites young people to pay attention,” said Smart, who works with the nonpartisan New Georgia Project and with a pro-marijuana education and awareness movement called We Want all the Smoke.


A key factor that young voters are watching for, he said, is whether the Biden administration moves forward with the process of downgrading cannabis.


“Hopefully that takes place before the election so we can really see, have something to go off of and not just have election speeches giving us hope,” he said.


Maya Tatum, former chair of the national grassroots group Students for Sensible Drug Policy, agreed that the candidates’ actions matter more than their words. Neither man, she said, is a clear winner here.


“A lot of the young voters that I'm around are wanting to hold Joe Biden accountable for what he said,” in support of cannabis, she said. “I don't personally feel like there's a lot that Trump is offering as it relates to cannabis.”


Fox said NORML would like to see political aspirants be more open about cannabis on the campaign trail.


“Any candidate that actually wants to get ahead – whether it's in the presidential election in Congress or state legislatures or local legislators – if they ignore this issue, it's going to be at their peril,” he said.

## Facebook opens its Android-based Quest operating system to other VR device makers

date: 2024-04-22, from: OS News

Today we’re taking the next step toward our vision for a more open computing platform for the metaverse. We’re opening up the operating system powering our Meta Quest devices to third-party hardware makers, giving more choice to consumers and a larger ecosystem for developers to build for. We’re working with leading global technology companies to bring this new ecosystem to life and making it even easier for developers to build apps and reach their audiences on the platform.  Meta Horizon OS is the result of a decade of work by Meta to build a next-generation computing platform. To pioneer standalone headsets, we developed technologies like inside-out tracking, and for more natural interaction systems and social presence, we developed eye, face, hand, and body tracking. For mixed reality, we built a full stack of technologies for blending the digital and physical worlds, including high-resolution Passthrough, Scene Understanding, and Spatial Anchors. This long-term investment that began on the mobile-first foundations of the Android Open Source Project has produced a full mixed reality operating system used by millions of people. ↫ Facebook&#8217;s blog In summary, Facebook wants the operating system of their Quest series of virtual reality devices &#8211; an Android Open Source Project fork optimised for this use &#8211; to become the default platform for virtual reality devices from all kinds of OEMs. Today, they&#8217;re announcing that both Asus and Lenovo will be releasing devices running this Meta Horizon OS, with the former focusing on high-end VR gaming, and the latter on more general use cases of work, entertainment, and so on. Facebook will also be working together with Microsoft to create a Quest &#8220;inspired by Xbox&#8221;. The Meta Quest Store, the on-device marketplace for applications and games, will be renamed to the Meta Horizon Store, and the App Lab, where developers can more easily get their applications and games on devices and in the hands of consumers as long as they meet basic technical and content guidelines, will be integrated into the Meta Horizon Store for easier access than before. In addition, in a mildly spicy move, Facebook is openly inviting Google to bring the Google Play Store to the VR Android fork, &#8220;where it can operate with the same economic model it does on other platforms&#8221;. The odds of me buying anything from Facebook are slim, so I really hope this new move won&#8217;t corner the market for VR headsets right out of the gate; I don&#8217;t want another Android/iOS duopoly. I&#8217;m not particularly interested in VR quite yet &#8211; but give it a few more years, and I certainly won&#8217;t pass up on a capable device that allows me to play Beat Saber and other exercise-focused applications and games. I just don&#8217;t want it to be a Facebook device or operating system.

## Work starts on bullet train rail line from Las Vegas to Los Angeles

date: 2024-04-22, from: VOA News USA

las vegas — A $12 billion high-speed passenger rail line between Las Vegas and the Los Angeles area has started construction, officials said Monday, amid predictions that millions of ticket-buyers will be boarding trains by 2028.


"People have been dreaming of high-speed rail in America for decades," U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement released to coincide with a ceremony at the future site of a terminal to be built just south of the Las Vegas Strip.


Buttigieg predicted the project will bring "thousands of union jobs, new connections to better economic opportunity, less congestion on the roads, and less pollution in the air."


Brightline West, whose sister company already operates a fast train between Miami and Orlando in Florida, aims to lay 351 kilometers of new track between Las Vegas and another new facility in Rancho Cucamonga, California. Almost the full distance is to be built in the median of Interstate 15, with a station stop in San Bernardino County's Victorville area.


Brightline Holdings founder and Chairperson Wes Edens dubbed the moment "the foundation for a new industry."


"This is a historic project and a proud moment," Edens said in the statement. "Today is long overdue."


Brightline aims to link other U.S. cities that are too near to each other for air travel to make sense and too far for people to drive the distance.

Company CEO Mike Reininger has said the goal is to have trains operating in time for the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028.


Brightline received $6.5 billion in backing from the Biden administration, including a $3 billion grant from federal infrastructure funds and approval to sell another $2.5 billion in tax-exempt bonds. The company won federal authorization in 2020 to sell $1 billion in similar bonds.


The project is touted as the first true high-speed passenger rail line in the nation, designed to reach speeds of 186 mph (300 kph), comparable to Japan's Shinkansen bullet trains.


The route between Vegas and L.A. is largely open space, with no convenient alternate to I-15. Brightline's Southern California terminal will be at a commuter rail connection to downtown Los Angeles.


The project outline says electric-powered trains will cut the four-hour trip across the Mojave Desert to a little more than two hours. Forecasts are for 11 million one-way passengers per year, or some 30,000 per day, with fares well below airline travel costs. The trains will offer restrooms, Wi-Fi, food and beverage sales and the option to check luggage.


Las Vegas is a popular driving destination for Southern Californians. Officials hope the train line will relieve congestion on I-15, where drivers often sit in miles of crawling traffic while returning home from a Las Vegas weekend.


The Las Vegas area, now approaching 3 million residents, draws more than 40 million visitors per year. Passenger traffic at the city's Harry Reid International Airport set a record of 57.6 million people in 2023. An average of more than 44,000 automobiles per day crossed the California-Nevada state line on I-15 in 2023, according to Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority data.


Florida-based Brightline Holdings launched the Miami-to-Orlando line in 2018 with trains reaching speeds up to 125 mph (200 kph). It expanded service to Orlando International Airport last September. It offers 16 roundtrips per day, with one-way tickets for the 235-mile (378-kilometer) distance costing about $80.


Other fast trains in the U.S. include Amtrak's Acela, which can top 241 kph while sharing tracks with freight and commuter service between Boston and Washington, D.C.


Passenger trains to Las Vegas ended in 1997, when Amtrak ended service.



Ideas for connecting other U.S. cities with high-speed passenger trains have been floated in recent years, including Dallas to Houston; Atlanta to Charlotte, North Carolina; and Chicago to St. Louis. Most have faced delays.


In California, voters in 2008 approved a proposed 805-kilometer rail line linking Los Angeles and San Francisco, but the plan has been beset by rising costs and routing disputes. A 2022 business plan by the California High-Speed Rail Authority projected the cost had more than tripled to $105 billion.

Post.News, a Twitter-like news-first social&#160;network,&#160;is shutting&#160;down.&#160;It is not surprising.&#160;It lacked dynamism and excitement, even&#160;as an early adopter and a former media&#160;professional. Given&#160;the&#160;overwhelming emphasis they put on establishment&#160;media, I am not surprised.&#160;The last time I visited&#160;Post.News&#160;was to read founder Noah Bardin’s post. “Our service is not growing fast enough to become a real business or a &#8230;

## US mulls sending more military advisers to Ukraine

date: 2024-04-22, from: VOA News USA

Pentagon — The United States may send additional military advisers to its embassy in Kyiv to advise and support the Ukrainian government and military, Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told VOA Monday.

 

The troops would serve in a “non-combat” role, Ryder said.   

 

“Throughout this conflict, the DOD (Department of Defense) has reviewed and adjusted our presence in-country, as security conditions have evolved. Currently, we are considering sending several additional advisers to augment the Office of Defense Cooperation (ODC) at the embassy,” Ryder said in a statement.

 

Two U.S. defense officials, speaking to VOA on the condition of anonymity to discuss plans that were not finalized, said the number of advisers was “small” and could fluctuate slightly based on embassy requirements. A source familiar with the considerations said the number of troops was “fewer than two dozen.”

 

The troops could advise on missions ranging from logistics, maintenance, communications and sustainment, the defense officials added.

 

Per the Pentagon, the ODC performs a variety of advisory and support missions and is embedded within the U.S. Embassy under the chief of the mission.  

 

Politico was first to report the additional troop consideration.

 

The Pentagon’s latest troop discussion comes after the U.S. House of Representatives on Saturday passed a four-part, $95 billion foreign aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

 

House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, structured the bills so that they could be combined into one after each bill was approved, to prevent opposition to any one piece from derailing the entire deal. Johnson had declined to bring the aid packages to the floor for a vote for months. The Senate had passed a supplemental aid bill in February, as Ukraine said ammunition shortages were causing its forces to pull back in areas.


The newly-passed House legislation includes $61 billion for Kyiv’s ongoing war against Moscow’s invasion, as well as $26 billion for Israel and humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones, including Gaza, and $8 billion for the Indo-Pacific region.

 

President Joe Biden in a statement Saturday urged the Senate to “quickly send this package to my desk so that I can sign it into law, and we can quickly send weapons and equipment to Ukraine to meet their urgent battlefield needs.”

 

He said the bills advanced U.S. national security interests and sends “a clear message about the power of American leadership on the world stage.”

</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Biden kicks off Earth Day with $7 billion for expanding solar access</h3><p>
	Today is Earth Day, but President Biden and his cabinet are celebrating all week long. Senior members of the administration have scheduled a national tour of events and announcements related to the president’s climate and environmental record. It starts with Biden’s visit to Prince William Forest Park in Triangle, Virginia, today, where he will announce $7 billion is being awarded to 60 state and local governments, tribes, and national and regional nonprofits through the Environmental Protection Agency’s <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VWsg6t21YzVJN6Mp0tm-rdC2W6mk3Cf5dbwdMN1h3yr83qn9gW7lCdLW6lZ3pgW8q9qrP3lnwmfW3jmpNc2ktTk0W7L52dW1MzjqSW50NV8L5GHtksW7K6Vv-6YKvTdW2yhwnV78Z8vxW1HvDXQ9l9y2FN7srNj42J5BsW8PpXGd2lrczXW7hq47t8_nvPLW1pTYyq4Q9C4mW4yV2Bg3Xv4jcW4QXqgY8t2vwpW5tgFl22xW0nPW5TGzLV8xrH-pW7z95ny2nFgWTW4kQrTJ69W050W6CGgRb29V9cXT8JKj4c8_70V8ypxZ3__J73W55X7QJ13GWF5V9Dyl67ClZ_gW16fNYN7fftR1W1c50D6917CZXf2f8bC804" target="_blank">Solar for All initiative</a>, which aims to support solar in low- to moderate-income communities. The average grant size will be more than $80 million, and the funding will be used to design new programs and bolster existing ones that subsidize the cost of rooftop solar installations, community solar projects, and battery storage.
</p><p>
	There’s a lot more on the schedule for the rest of the week, but here’s an abbreviated version:
</p><p>
<strong>Today:</strong> Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is out West helping break ground on the Brightline West High-Speed Rail Project; Arati Prabhakar, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, is in Maine to announce $123 million in funding for habitat restoration; Energy Secretary Tom Vilsack heads to Pennsylvania to announce funding for clean energy projects.
</p><p>
<span></span><strong>Later this week:</strong> Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland will be in New Orleans to unveil new measures to develop an offshore wind economy; Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm heads to New Mexico to talk about new efforts to support domestic solar and wind manufacturing; and Haaland will cut the ribbon at a new visitors’ center at Delaware’s First State National Historical Park.

The week wasn’t a complete bust.

</p><h3>5. VW plant in Tennessee votes to join UAW</h3><p>
<span></span>A majority of Volkswagen workers at a Tennessee plant voted over the weekend to join the United Auto Workers union. The Chattanooga factory is the first auto plant in the South to unionize, but the UAW hopes it won’t be the last. A Mercedes plant in Alabama is set to vote on UAW membership next month, and the union wants to see more plants unionize over the next two years. Anti-union sentiment runs deep in southern auto plants, but non-union workers typically have lower wages and fewer job protections than unionized workers, so a series of UAW victories could change a lot of lives.

## New version of Tiny11 Builder lets you debloat any Windows 11 build or version

date: 2024-04-22, from: OS News

The maker of Tiny11, a third-party project that aims to make Windows 11 less bloated with unnecessary parts, released a new version of Tiny11 Builder, a special tool that lets you create a custom Windows 11 image tailored to your needs and preferences. The latest release makes it much easier to create a lightweight Windows 11 ISO without worrying about installing a system modified by unknown third parties. ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin Perhaps you can make Windows 11 slightly more bearable with this. If there&#8217;s any interest from y&#8217;all, I could build my own debloated Windows 11 install and see if I can make this platform bearable for myself? Let me know in the comments.

## Inside the Super Nintendo cartridges

date: 2024-04-22, from: OS News

One of the remarkable characteristics of the Super Nintendo was the ability for game cartridges (cart) to pack more than instructions and assets into ROM chips. If we open and look at the PCBs, we can find inside things like the CIC copy protection chip, SRAM, and even &#8220;enhancement processors&#8221;. ↫ Fabien Sanglard When I was a child and teenager in the &#8217;90s, the capabilities of the SNES cartridge were a bit of a legend. We&#8217;d talk about what certain games would use which additional processors and chips in the cartridge, right or wrong, often boasting about the games we owned, and talking down the games we didn&#8217;t. Much of it was probably nonsense, but there&#8217;s some good memories there. We&#8217;re decades deep into the internet age now, and all the mysteries of the SNES cartridge can just be looked up on Wikipedia and endless numbers of other websites. The mystery&#8217;s all gone, but at least now we can accurately marvel at just how versatile the SNES really was.

## Biden Hands Out $7 Billion to Expand Solar Access

date: 2024-04-22, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjA1NTYxMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczODc1OTA4Nn0.85WpdmDQyXswEpTnvTRv8IrinPVkbabi1DT5g1yjEnA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>The great promise of solar panels — in addition to their being carbon-free — is the democratization of energy. Anyone can produce their own power, typically for less than the going utility rate. The problem is that those who stand to benefit the most from this opportunity <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy21osti/80532.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>haven’t been able to access it</u></a>.</p>
<p>That pattern could change, however, with Solar for All, a $7 billion program under the Environmental Protection Agency to support solar in low- to moderate-income communities. On Monday, the Biden administration announced it was awarding the funds to 60 state and local governments, tribes, and national and regional nonprofits, at an average grant size of more than $80 million.</p>
<p>The funding will be used to design new programs and bolster existing ones that subsidize the cost of rooftop solar installations, community solar projects and battery storage. During a press call on Friday, the administration said the awardees have committed to deliver at least 20% utility bill savings to the households they serve.</p>
<p>To get a sense of how transformative Solar for All could be, it’s helpful to look at the numbers. According to <a href="https://www.energy.gov/scep/low-income-energy-affordability-data-lead-tool-and-community-energy-solutions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Department of Energy data</u></a>, low- to moderate-income households spend an average of 6% of their income on energy, with some paying as much as 30%, whereas households at higher income levels spend an average of just 2%. As much as <a href="https://www.energy.gov/justice/articles/households-color-continue-experience-energy-insecurity-disproportionately-higher" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a quarter of the country reports</u></a> having struggled to pay electric bills, sacrificing basic needs like food and medicine or keeping their homes at unsafe temperatures because of energy concerns.</p>
<p>The number of these households installing rooftop solar has been increasing steadily year over year, but in 2022, they still made up only about 22% of installations, though they represent about 43% of the population.</p><center><iframe aria-label="Interactive line chart" data-external="1" frameborder="0" height="454" id="datawrapper-chart-JliCa" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JliCa/3/" style="border: none;" title="Solar’s Wealth Disparity" width="680"></iframe><p style="text-align: left;">The disparity is largely due to the high up-front cost of a solar installation, plus the fact that lower-income Americans are less likely to own their homes. While there’s a federal tax incentive to bring down the cost, low-income households may not have the tax liability to take advantage of it. They also are more likely to live in older homes that require roof repairs, the cost of which are often not covered by incentive programs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Solar for All represents a potential step change. In at least 25 of the states and territories awarded through the program, there are no pre-existing low-income solar programs. The EPA estimates that the funds will help more than 900,000 households see the benefits of solar. It will also increase resilience in low-income communities during power outages by giving more households access to backup batteries.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Biden and his cabinet are taking a victory lap this week in honor of Earth Day, with a national tour of events and announcements related to the president’s climate and environmental record. In addition to Solar For All, the administration also launched a new <a href="http://climatecorps.gov" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>web portal</u></a> for the <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/the-climate-corps-invests-in-a-different-kind-of-green-economy" target="_self"><u>American Climate Corps</u></a> on Monday, which lists nearly 2,000 training and job opportunities in fields like solar installation and mangrove restoration.</p><p style="text-align: left;">With this $7 billion heading out the door this summer, Biden will soon have distributed the full $27 billion that Congress allocated to a program called the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund two years ago when it passed the Inflation Reduction Act. The initial $20 billion was awarded in early April to launch a <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/the-biden-administration-is-unleashing-20-billion-for-green-banks" target="_self"><u>national network of green banks</u></a> that will provide low-cost loans and other affordable finance options for climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives.</p></center>

## Mary J. Blige, Cher, Ozzy Osbourne, others picked for Rock Hall of Fame

date: 2024-04-22, from: VOA News USA

new york — Mary J. Blige,Cher, Foreigner, A Tribe Called Quest, Kool & The Gang and Ozzy Osbourne have been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, a class that also includes folk-rockers Dave Matthews Band and singer-guitarist Peter Frampton.


Alexis Korner, John Mayall and Big Mama Thornton earned the Musical Influence Award, while the late Jimmy Buffett, MC5, Dionne Warwick and Norman Whitfield will get the Musical Excellence Award. Pioneering music executive Suzanne de Passe won the Ahmet Ertegun Award.


"Rock 'n' roll is an ever-evolving amalgam of sounds that impacts culture and moves generations," John Sykes, chairman of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, said in a statement. "This diverse group of inductees each broke down musical barriers and influenced countless artists that followed in their footsteps."




The induction ceremony will be held October 19 at the Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse in the city of Cleveland in the U.S. state of Ohio. It will stream live on Disney+ with an airing on ABC at a later date and available on Hulu the next day.


The music acts nominated this year but didn't make the cut included Mariah Carey, Lenny Kravitz, the late Sinead O'Connor, soul-pop singer Sade, Britpoppers Oasis, hip-hop duo Eric B. & Rakim, and alt-rockers Jane's Addiction.


There had been a starry push to get Foreigner — with the hits "Urgent" and Hot Blooded" — into the hall, with Mark Ronson, Jack Black, Slash, Dave Grohl and Paul McCartney all publicly backing the move. Ronson's stepfather is Mick Jones, Foreigner's founding member, songwriter and lead guitarist.


Osbourne, who led many parents in the 1980s to clutch their pearls with his devil imagery and sludgy music, goes in as a solo artist, having already been inducted into the hall with metal masters Black Sabbath.




Four of the eight nominees — Cher, Foreigner, Frampton and Kool & the Gang — were on the ballot for the first time.


Cher — the only artist to have a Number 1 song in each of the past six decades — and Blige, with eight multi-platinum albums and nine Grammy Awards, will help boost the number of women in the hall, which critics say is too low.


Artists must have released their first commercial recording at least 25 years before they're eligible for induction.


Nominees were voted on by more than 1,000 artists, historians and music industry professionals. Fans voted online or in person at the museum, with the top five artists picked by the public making up a "fans' ballot" that was tallied with the other professional ballots.


Last year, Missy Elliott, Willie Nelson, Sheryl Crow, Chaka Khan, "Soul Train" creator Don Cornelius, Kate Bush, and the late George Michael were some of the artists who got into the hall.

## Appeals court stifles US city's efforts to remove Columbus statue

date: 2024-04-22, from: VOA News USA

PITTSBURGH — An appeals court in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania has kept alive an Italian heritage group's challenge to efforts by the city of Pittsburgh to remove a statue of Christopher Columbus from a city park.


The Commonwealth Court on Friday sent the dispute over the 13-foot bronze and granite Schenley Park statue back to Allegheny County Common Pleas Court for further consideration of issues raised by opponents of the removal.


The Italian Sons and Daughters of America filed suit in October 2020 after the Pittsburgh Art Commission voted to remove the statue and then-Mayor Bill Peduto also recommended its removal. The group argued that the mayor could not override a 1955 city council ordinance that cleared the way for installation of the 800-pound statue. City attorneys argued that the legislation was more akin to a resolution accepting a gift and no council action to rescind it was needed.


Common Pleas Judge John McVay Jr., after urging both sides for two years to work out a solution such as relocation, ruled in 2022 that because the statue is in a city-owned park, it represents government speech. But the Commonwealth Court wrote Friday that McVay erred in concluding that the group's claims “are barred in their entirety," rejecting what it called the idea that claims of violations of the city's charter, code and ordinance were “irrelevant procedural quibbles.”


The appellate court did reject the group's challenge to McVay's refusal to remove himself from the case.


Philadelphia attorney George Bochetto, who filed the lawsuit and subsequent appeal on behalf of the group, hailed the ruling and called on the new mayor to “sit down with me to reach a resolution without further costly litigation." A message seeking comment was sent Sunday to a spokesperson for the Pittsburgh mayor.


The Schenley Park statue, vandalized several times, was wrapped in plastic in 2020, but local news reports indicate that much of the covering has since worn away or perhaps been removed, although the head remains covered.


Disputes over Columbus statues have roiled other cities across the nation, including Philadelphia on the other side of the state, where supporters in a city with a deep Italian heritage say they consider Columbus an emblem of that heritage. Former Mayor Jim Kenney, however, said Columbus, venerated for centuries as an explorer, had a “much more infamous” history, enslaving Indigenous people and imposing harsh punishments.


After 2020 protests about racial injustice and the statue, Kenney ordered the 1876 statue's removal, calling it a matter of public safety. But a judge reversed that decision, saying the city had failed to provide evidence of a public safety need for removal. In December 2022, a plywood box covering the statue was removed by judicial order. The group that fought for retention of the statue and removal of the covering filed suit last year alleging that officials conspired to abuse the legal process in trying to remove the statue, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported.


Columbus statues have been removed in nearby Camden, New Jersey, and Wilmington, Delaware. In Richmond, Virginia, a statue of Christopher Columbus was torn down, set on fire and thrown into a lake. In Columbia, South Carolina, the first U.S. city named for Columbus, a statue of the explorer was removed after it was vandalized several times. Another vandalized statue in Boston also was removed from its pedestal.

## Terry Anderson, US journalist held captive for nearly 7 years, dies

date: 2024-04-21, from: VOA News USA

los angeles, california  — Terry Anderson, the globe-trotting Associated Press correspondent who became one of America's longest-held hostages after he was snatched from a street in war-torn Lebanon in 1985 and held for nearly seven years, has died at 76.


Anderson, who chronicled his abduction and torturous imprisonment by Islamic militants in his best-selling 1993 memoir "Den of Lions," died Sunday at his home in Greenwood Lake, New York, said his daughter, Sulome Anderson.


The cause of death was unknown, though his daughter said Anderson recently had heart surgery.


"He never liked to be called a hero, but that's what everyone persisted in calling him," said Sulome Anderson. "I saw him a week ago and my partner asked him if he had anything on his bucket list, anything that he wanted to do. He said, 'I've lived so much, and I've done so much. I'm content.'"


After returning to the United States in 1991, Anderson led a peripatetic life, giving public speeches, teaching journalism at several prominent universities and, at various times, operating a blues bar, Cajun restaurant, horse ranch and gourmet restaurant.


He also struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder, won millions of dollars in frozen Iranian assets after a federal court concluded that country played a role in his capture, then lost most of it to bad investments. He filed for bankruptcy in 2009.


Upon retiring from the University of Florida in 2015, Anderson settled on a small horse farm in a quiet, rural section of northern Virginia he had discovered while camping with friends.


"I live in the country and it's reasonably good weather and quiet out here and a nice place, so I'm doing all right," he said with a chuckle during a 2018 interview with The Associated Press.


In 1985 he became one of several Westerners abducted by members of the Shiite Muslim group Hezbollah during a time of war that had plunged Lebanon into chaos.


After his release, he returned to a hero's welcome at AP's New York headquarters.


As the AP's chief Middle East correspondent, Anderson had been reporting for several years on the rising violence gripping Lebanon as the country fought a war with Israel, while Iran funded militant groups trying to topple its government.


Chained to wall, threatened with death


On March 16, 1985, a day off, he had taken a break to play tennis with former AP photographer Don Mell and was dropping Mell off at his home when gun-toting kidnappers dragged him from his car.


He was likely targeted, he said, because he was one of the few Westerners still in Lebanon and because his role as a journalist aroused suspicion among members of Hezbollah.


"Because in their terms, people who go around asking questions in awkward and dangerous places have to be spies," he told the Virginia newspaper Orange County Review in 2018.


What followed was nearly seven years of brutality during which he was beaten, chained to a wall, threatened with death, often had guns held to his head and often was kept in solitary confinement.


Anderson was the longest held of several Western hostages Hezbollah abducted over the years, including Terry Waite, the former envoy to the Archbishop of Canterbury, who had arrived to try to negotiate his release.


By his and other hostages' accounts, he was also their most hostile prisoner, constantly demanding better food and treatment, arguing religion and politics with his captors, and teaching other hostages sign language and where to hide messages so they could communicate privately.


He managed to retain a quick wit and biting sense of humor during his long ordeal. On his last day in Beirut, he called the leader of his kidnappers into his room to tell him he'd just heard an erroneous radio report saying he'd been freed and was in Syria.


"I said, 'Mahmound, listen to this, I'm not here. I'm gone, babes. I'm on my way to Damascus.' And we both laughed," he told Giovanna DellOrto, author of "AP Foreign Correspondents in Action: World War II to the Present."


He learned later his release was delayed when a third party who his kidnappers planned to turn him over to left for a tryst with the party's mistress and they had to find someone else.


Trauma lasted for years


Anderson's humor often hid the PTSD he acknowledged suffering for years afterward.


"The AP got a couple of British experts in hostage decompression, clinical psychiatrists, to counsel my wife and myself and they were very useful," he said in 2018. "But one of the problems I had was I did not recognize sufficiently the damage that had been done.


"So, when people ask me, you know, 'Are you over it?' Well, I don't know. No, not really. It's there. I don't think about it much these days, it's not central to my life. But it's there."


At the time of his abduction, Anderson was engaged to be married and his future wife was six months pregnant with their daughter, Sulome.


The couple married soon after his release but divorced a few years later, and although they remained on friendly terms Anderson and his daughter were estranged for years.


"I love my dad very much. My dad has always loved me. I just didn't know that because he wasn't able to show it to me," Sulome Anderson told the AP in 2017.


Father and daughter reconciled after the publication of her critically acclaimed 2017 book, "The Hostage's Daughter," in which she told of traveling to Lebanon to confront and eventually forgive one of her father's kidnappers.


"I think she did some extraordinary things, went on a very difficult personal journey, but also accomplished a pretty important piece of journalism doing it," Anderson said. "She's now a better journalist than I ever was."


Chose Marines over Michigan


Terry Alan Anderson was born Oct. 27, 1947. He spent his early childhood years in the small Lake Erie town of Vermilion, Ohio, where his father was a police officer.


After graduating from high school, he turned down a scholarship to the University of Michigan in favor of enlisting in the Marines, where he rose to the rank of staff sergeant while seeing combat during the Vietnam War.


After returning home, he enrolled at Iowa State University where he graduated with a double major in journalism and political science and soon after went to work for the AP. He reported from Kentucky, Japan and South Africa before arriving in Lebanon in 1982, just as the country was descending into chaos.


"Actually, it was the most fascinating job I've ever had in my life," he told the Orange County Review. "It was intense. War's going on — it was very dangerous in Beirut. Vicious civil war, and I lasted about three years before I got kidnapped."


Anderson was married and divorced three times. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by another daughter, Gabrielle Anderson, from his first marriage.

## Episode 130 - ALGOL, Part II

date: 2024-04-21, from: Advent of Computing

## Niri 0.1.5 released

date: 2024-04-21, from: OS News

Earlier this year, we talked about Niri, a very unique tiling window manager for Wayland that scrolls infinitely to the right. I&#8217;ve never seen anything quite like it, and while it seems polarising, I think it&#8217;s absolutely worthy of a dedicated niche. The project&#8217;s got a major new release out, and there&#8217;s a lot of improvements here. First and foremost, virtually all animations have been overhauled, and new ones have been added for almost every kind of interaction. The videos on the release page do a really good job of highlighting what they&#8217;re going for, and I think it looks great, and for the animation-averse, every individual animation can be turned off. Niri now also supports variable refresh rate, and the IPC mechanism has been improved. Among the smaller improvements is a welcome one: when using the touchscreen, the mouse cursor disappears. I really think this one has to be tried before judged, and I&#8217;m seriously contemplating setting up a Wayland environment just for this one, to see if it works for me. My window &#8220;flow&#8221;, if that makes sense, is already left-to-right, so the idea of having that effectively automated with an infinite canvas sounds very appealing to me, especially on smaller displays. I just need to figure out if it works in reality.

## 'Civil War’ continues box-office campaign at No. 1

date: 2024-04-21, from: VOA News USA

New York — “Civil War,” Alex Garland’s ominous American dystopia, remained the top film in theaters in its second week of release, according to studio estimates Sunday.



The A24 election-year gamble, the indie studio’s biggest budgeted film yet, took in $11.1 million in ticket sales at 3,929 theaters over the weekend. The $50 million film, set in a near-future U.S. in which Texas and California have joined in rebellion against a fascist president, has grossed $44.9 million in two weeks.


Its provocative premise — and A24’s marketing, which included images of U.S. cities ravaged by war — helped keep “Civil War” top of mind for moviegoers.


But it was a painfully slow weekend in theaters — the kind sure to add to concern over what’s thus far been a down year for Hollywood at the box office.




Going into the weekend, Universal Pictures’ “Abigail,” a critically acclaimed R-rated horror film about the daughter of Dracula, had been expected to lead ticket sales. It came in second with $10.2 million in 3,384 theaters.


That was still a fair result for a film that cost a modest $28 million to make. “Abigail,” which remakes the 1936 monster film “Dracula’s Daughter,” is about a 12-year-old girl taken by kidnappers who soon realize they’ve made a poor choice of hostage. It’s directed by the duo Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett whose production company goes by the name Radio Silence.


More concerning was the overall tepid response for a handful of new wide releases — and the likelihood that there will be more similar weekends throughout 2024. Last year’s actors and writers' strikes, which had a prolonged effect on the movie pipeline, exacerbated holes in Hollywood’s release schedule.


Horror films, in recent years among the most reliable cash cows in theaters, also haven’t thus far been doing the automatic business they previously did. According to David A. Gross, who runs the consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research, horror releases accounted for $2 billion in worldwide sales in 2023.


Guy Ritchie’s “The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare” debuted with $9 million in 2,845 theaters. In the based-on-a-true-story Lionsgate release, which reportedly cost $60 million to produce, Henry Cavill leads a World War II mission off the coast of West Africa.


Though Ritchie has been behind numerous box-office hits, including the live-action “Aladdin” and a pair of Sherlock Holmes films, his recent movies have struggled to find big audiences. The Lionsgate spy comedy “Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre” grossed $48 million against a $50 million budget, while MGM’s “The Covenant,” also released last year, made $21 million while costing $55 million to make.


A bright sign for “The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare” — audiences liked it. The film earned an A-minus CinemaScore.


The anime “Spy x Family Code: White,” from Sony’s Crunchyroll, also struggled to stand out with audiences. Though the adaptation of the Tatsuya Endo manga TV series “Spy x Family” has already been a hit with international moviegoers, it debuted below expectations with $4.9 million in 2,009 U.S. theaters.


The mightiest film globally, though, continues to be “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.” The Warner Bros. monster movie has for the past month led worldwide ticket sales. It added another $9.5 million domestically and $21.6 million internationally to bring its four-week global total to $485.2 million.


Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.


 


1. “Civil War,” $11.1 million.


2. “Abigail,” $10.2 million.


3. “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,” $9.5 million.


4. “The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,” $9 million.


5. “Spy x Family Code: White,” $4.9 million.


6. “Kung Fu Panda 4," $4.6 million.


7. “Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,” $4.4 million.


8. “Dune: Part Two,” $2.9 million.


9. “Monkey Man,” $2.2 million.


10. “The First Omen,” $1.7 million.

## TikTok raises free speech concerns on bill passed by US House that may ban app

date: 2024-04-21, from: VOA News USA

Washington — TikTok on Sunday raised free speech concerns about a bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives that would ban the popular social media app in the U.S. if its Chinese owner ByteDance did not sell its stake within a year. 


The House passed the legislation on Saturday by a margin of 360 to 58. It now moves to the Senate where it could be taken up for a vote in the coming days. President Joe Biden has previously said he will sign the legislation. 


The step to include TikTok in a broader foreign aid package may fast-track the timeline on a potential ban after an earlier separate bill stalled in the U.S. Senate. 


"It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans," TikTok said in a statement.  


Many U.S. lawmakers from both the Republican and Democratic parties and the Biden administration say TikTok poses national security risks because China could compel the company to share the data of its 170 million U.S. users. TikTok insists it has never shared U.S. data and never would. 


Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Warner, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, on Sunday said TikTok could be used as a propaganda tool by the Chinese government. 


"Many young people on TikTok get their news (from the app), the idea that we would give the (Chinese) Communist Party this much of a propaganda tool as well as the ability to scrape 170 million Americans' personal data, it is a national security risk," he told CBS News. 


Some progressive Democrats have also raised free speech concerns over a ban and instead asked for stronger data privacy regulations.  


Democratic U.S. Representative Ro Khanna said on Sunday that he felt a TikTok ban may not survive legal scrutiny in courts, citing the U.S. Constitution's free speech protections. 


"I don't think its going to pass First Amendment scrutiny," he said in an interview to ABC News. 


The House voted on March 13 to give ByteDance about six months to divest the U.S. assets of the short-video app, or face a ban. The legislation passed on Saturday gives a nine-month deadline which could be further extended by three months if the president were to determine progress toward a sale. 


TikTok was also a topic of conversation in a call between Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping earlier this month. The White House said Biden raised American concerns about the app's ownership.

## Hawaii lawmakers take aim at vacation rentals after wildfire amplifies housing crisis

date: 2024-04-21, from: VOA News USA

HONOLULU  — A single mother of two, Amy Chadwick spent years scrimping and saving to buy a house in the town of Lahaina on the Hawaiian island of Maui. But after a devastating fire leveled Lahaina in August and reduced Chadwick's home to white dust, the cheapest rental she could find for her family and dogs cost $10,000 a month.


Chadwick, a fine-dining server, moved to Florida where she could stretch her homeowners insurance dollars. She's worried Maui's exorbitant rental prices, driven in part by vacation rentals that hog a limited housing supply, will hollow out her tight-knit town.


Most people in Lahaina work for hotels, restaurants and tour companies and can't afford $5,000 to $10,000 a month in rent, she said.


"You're pushing out an entire community of service industry people. So no one's going to be able to support the tourism that you're putting ahead of your community," Chadwick said by phone from her new home in Satellite Beach on Florida's Space Coast. "Nothing good is going to come of it unless they take a serious stance, putting their foot down and really regulating these short-term rentals."


The August 8 wildfire killed 101 people and destroyed housing for 6,200 families, amplifying Maui's already acute housing shortage and laying bare the enormous presence of vacation rentals in Lahaina. It reminded lawmakers that short-term rentals are an issue across Hawaii, prompting them to consider bills that would give counties the authority to phase them out.


Gov. Josh Green got so frustrated he blurted an expletive during a recent news conference.




"This fire uncovered a clear truth, which is we have too many short-term rentals owned by too many individuals on the mainland and it is b———t," Green said. "And our people deserve housing, here."


Vacation rentals are a popular alternative to hotels for those seeking kitchens, lower costs and opportunities to sample everyday island life. Supporters say they boost tourism, the state's biggest employer. Critics revile them for inflating housing costs, upending neighborhoods and contributing to the forces pushing locals and Native Hawaiians to leave Hawaii for less expensive states.


This migration has become a major concern in Lahaina. The Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement, a nonprofit, estimates at least 1,500 households — or a quarter of those who lost their homes — have left since the August wildfire.


The blaze burned single family homes and apartments in and around downtown, which is the core of Lahaina's residential housing. An analysis by the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization found a relatively low 7.5% of units there were vacation rentals as of February 2023.


Lahaina neighborhoods spared by the fire have a much higher ratio of vacation rentals: About half the housing in Napili, about 11 kilometers north of the burn zone, is short-term rentals.


Napili is where Chadwick thought she found a place to buy when she first went house hunting in 2016. But a Canadian woman secured it with a cash offer and turned it into a vacation rental.


Also outside the burn zone are dozens of short-term rental condominium buildings erected decades ago on land zoned for apartments.




In 1992, Maui County explicitly allowed owners in these buildings to rent units for less than 180 days at a time even without short-term rental permits. Since November, activists have occupied the beach in front of Lahaina's biggest hotels to push the mayor or governor to use their emergency powers to revoke this exemption.


Money is a powerful incentive for owners to rent to travelers: a 2016 report prepared for the state found a Honolulu vacation rental generates 3.5 times the revenue of a long-term rental.


State Rep. Luke Evslin, the Housing Committee chair, said Maui and Kauai counties have suffered net losses of residential housing in recent years thanks to a paucity of new construction and the conversion of so many homes to short-term rentals.


"Every alarm bell we have should be ringing when we're literally going backwards in our goal to provide more housing in Hawaii," he said.


In his own Kauai district, Evslin sees people leaving, becoming homeless or working three jobs to stay afloat.


The Democrat was one of 47 House members who co-sponsored one version of legislation that would allow short-term rentals to be phased out. One objective is to give counties more power after a U.S. judge in 2022 ruled Honolulu violated state law when it attempted to prohibit rentals for less than 90 days. Evslin said that decision left Hawaii's counties with limited tools, such as property taxes, to control vacation rentals.


Lawmakers also considered trying to boost Hawaii's housing supply by forcing counties to allow more houses to be built on individual lots. But they watered down the measure after local officials said they were already exploring the idea.


Short-term rental owners said a phase-out would violate their property rights and take their property without compensation, potentially pushing them into foreclosure. Some predicted legal challenges.


Alicia Humiston, president of the Rentals by Owner Awareness Association, said some areas in West Maui were designed for travelers and therefore lack schools and other infrastructure families need.


"This area in West Maui that is sort of like this resort apartment zone — that's all north of Lahaina — it was never built to be local living," Humiston said.


One housing advocate argues that just because a community allowed vacation rentals decades ago doesn't mean it still needs to now.


"We are not living in the 1990s or in the 1970s," said Sterling Higa, executive director of Housing Hawaii's Future. Counties "should have the authority to look at existing laws and reform them as necessary to provide for the public good."


Courtney Lazo, a real estate agent who is part of Lahaina Strong, the group occupying Kaanapali Beach, said tourists can stay in her hometown now but many locals can't.


"How do you expect a community to recover and heal and move forward when the people who make Lahaina, Lahaina, aren't even there anymore?" she said at a recent news conference as her voice quivered. "They're moving away."

## Chicago's response to migrant influx stirs long-standing frustrations among its Blacks

date: 2024-04-21, from: VOA News USA

CHICAGO — The closure of Wadsworth Elementary School in 2013 was a blow to residents of the majority-Black neighborhood it served, symbolizing a city indifferent to their interests. 


So when the city reopened Wadsworth last year to shelter hundreds of migrants without seeking community input, it added insult to injury. Across Chicago, Black residents are frustrated that long-standing needs are not being met while the city's newly arrived are cared for with a sense of urgency, and with their tax dollars. 


"Our voices are not valued nor heard," said Genesis Young, a lifelong Chicagoan who lives near Wadsworth. 


Chicago is one of several big American cities grappling with a surge of migrants. The Republican governor of Texas has been sending them by the busload to highlight his grievances with the Biden administration's immigration policy. 


To manage the influx, Chicago has already spent more than $300 million of city, state and federal funds to provide housing, health care, education and more to over 38,000 mostly South American migrants who have arrived in the city since 2022, desperate for help. The speed with which these funds were marshaled has stirred widespread resentment among Black Chicagoans.


But community leaders are trying to ease racial tensions and channel the public's frustrations into agitating for the greater good. 


Political reactions


The outcry over migrants in Chicago and other large Democrat-led cities is having wider implications in an election year: The Biden administration is now advocating a more restrictive approach to immigration in its negotiations with Republicans in Congress. 




Since the Wadsworth building reopened as a shelter, Young has felt "extreme anxiety" because of the noise, loitering and around-the-clock police presence that came with it. More than anything, she and other neighbors say it is a reminder of problems that have been left unsolved for years, including high rates of crime, unemployment and homelessness. 


"I definitely don't want to seem insensitive to them and them wanting a better life. However, if you can all of a sudden come up with all these millions of dollars to address their housing, why didn't you address the homeless issue here?" said Charlotte Jackson, the owner of a bakery and restaurant in the South Loop neighborhood. 


"For so long we accepted that this is how things had to be in our communities," said Chris Jackson, who co-founded the bakery with his wife. "This migrant crisis has made many people go: 'Wait a minute, no it doesn't.' " 


Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson declined to comment for this story. 


The city received more than $200 million from the state and federal governments to help care for migrants after Johnson appealed to Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and President Joe Biden. The president will be in Chicago in August to make his reelection pitch at the 2024 Democratic National Convention. 


Some see opportunity


Some Black Chicagoans are protesting the placement of shelters in their neighborhoods, but others aim to turn the adversity into an opportunity. 


"Chicago is a microcosm to the rest of the nation," said the Reverend Janette C. Wilson, national executive director of the civil rights group PUSH for Excellence. Black communities have faced discrimination and underinvestment for decades and are justifiably frustrated, Wilson said. The attention the migrants are receiving is deserved, she added, but it's also a chance for cities to reflect on their responsibility to all underserved communities. 


"There is a moral imperative to take care of everybody," Wilson said. 


After nearly two years of acrimony, the city has begun to curb some accommodations for migrants – which has caused its own backlash. The city last month started evicting migrants who overstayed a 60-day limit at shelters, prompting condemnation from immigrant rights groups and from residents worried about public safety. 


Marlita Ingram, a school guidance counselor who lives in the South Shore neighborhood, said she was concerned about the resources being shared "equitably" between migrants and longtime residents. But she said she also believed that "it doesn't have to be a competition" and sympathized with the nearly 6,000 migrant children now enrolled in Chicago's public schools. 


As the potential for racial strife rises, some activists are pointing to history as a cautionary tale. 


Hundreds of thousands of Black Southerners moved to Chicago in the early 20th century in search of greater freedoms and economic opportunities. White Chicagoans at the time accused them of receiving disproportionate resources from the city, and in 1919 tensions boiled over. 




In a surge of racist attacks in cities across the U.S. that came to be known as "Red Summer," white residents burned large swaths of Chicago's Black neighborhoods and killed 38 Black people, including by lynching. 


"Those white folks were, like, 'Hell, no, they're coming here, they're taking our jobs,' '' said Richard Wallace, founder of Equity and Transformation, a majority-Black community group that co-hosted a forum in March to improve dialogue between Black and Latino residents. 


Echoes of past


He hears echoes of that past bigotry — intentional or not — when Black Chicagoans complain about the help being given to migrants. "How did we become like the white folks who were resisting our people coming to the city of the Chicago?" he said. 


Labor and immigrant rights organizers have worked for years to tamp down divisions among working class communities. But the migrant crisis has created tensions between the city's large Mexican American community and recently arrived migrants, many of whom hail from Venezuela. 


"If left unchecked, we all panic, we're all scared, we're going to retreat to our corners," said Leone Jose Bicchieri, executive director of Working Family Solidarity, a majority-Hispanic labor rights group. "The truth is that this city wouldn't work without Black and Latino people." 


Black Americans' views on immigration and diversity are expansive. The Civil Rights Movement was instrumental in pushing the U.S. to adopt a more inclusive immigration policy. 


About half of Black Americans say the United States' diverse population makes the country strong, including 30% who say it makes the U.S. "much stronger," according to a March poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. 




Many leaders in Black neighborhoods in and around Chicago are trying to  acknowledge the tensions without exacerbating them. 


"Our church is divided on the migrant crisis," said the Reverend Chauncey Brown, pastor of Second Baptist Church in Maywood, Illinois, a majority-Black suburb of Chicago where some migrants are living in shelters. 


There has been a noticeable uptick of non-English speakers in the pews, many of whom have said they are migrants in need of food and other services, Brown said. Some church members cautioned him against speaking out in support of migrants or allotting more church resources to them. But he said the Bible's teachings are clear on this issue. 


"When a stranger enters your land, you are to care for them as if they are one of your own," he said.

## Taiwan to discuss with US how to use new funding

date: 2024-04-21, from: VOA News USA

TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwan's defense ministry said Sunday it will discuss with the United States how to use funding for the island included in a $95 billion legislative package mostly providing security assistance to Ukraine and Israel. 


The United States is Taiwan's most important international supporter and arms supplier despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties. 


Democratically governed Taiwan has faced increased military pressure from China, which views the island as its own territory. Taiwan's government rejects those claims. 


The defense ministry expressed thanks to the U.S. House of Representatives for passing the package on Saturday, saying it demonstrated the "rock solid" U.S. support for Taiwan. 


The ministry added it "will coordinate the relevant budget uses with the United States through existing exchange mechanisms and work hard to strengthen combat readiness capabilities to ensure national security and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait." 


Taiwan has since 2022 complained of delays in deliveries of U.S. weapons such as Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, as manufacturers focused on supplying Ukraine to help the country battle invading Russian forces. 


Underscoring the pressure Taiwan faces from China, the ministry said Sunday morning that during the previous 24 hours 14 Chinese military aircraft had crossed the sensitive median line of the Taiwan Strait. 


The median line once served as an unofficial border between the two sides, which neither military crossed. But China's air force now regularly sends aircraft over it. China says it does not recognize the line's existence. 


On Saturday, Taiwan's defense ministry said China had again carried out "joint combat readiness patrols" with Chinese warships and warplanes around Taiwan. 


China's defense ministry did not answer calls seeking comment outside of office hours Sunday. 


The island's armed forces are dwarfed by those of China's, especially the navy and air force.

## Once foreign aid bill signed, this is how US can rush weapons to Ukraine

date: 2024-04-21, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — The Pentagon could get weapons moving to Ukraine within days once Congress passes a long-delayed aid bill. That's because it has a network of storage sites in the U.S. and Europe that hold the ammunition and air defense components that Kyiv desperately needs.


Moving fast is critical, CIA Director Bill Burns said this past week, warning that without additional aid from the U.S., Ukraine could lose the war to Russia by the end of this year.


"We would like very much to be able to rush the security assistance in the volumes we think they need to be able to be successful," Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said.


The House approved $61 billion in funding for the war-torn country Saturday. It still needs to clear the Senate and President Joe Biden’s signature.


Once that happens, "we have a very robust logistics network that enables us to move material very quickly," Ryder told reporters this past week. "We can move within days."


Ready to go


The Pentagon has had supplies ready to go for months but hasn't moved them because it is out of money. It has spent the funding Congress previously provided to support Ukraine, sending more than $44 billion worth of weapons, maintenance, training and spare parts since Russia's February 2022 invasion.


By December, the Pentagon was $10 billion in the hole, because it is going to cost more now to replace the systems it sent to the battlefield in Ukraine.


As a result, the Pentagon's frequent aid packages for Ukraine dried up because there had been no guarantee that Congress would pass the additional funding needed to replenish the weapons the U.S. has been sending to Ukraine.


The lag in weapons deliveries has forced Ukrainian troops to spend months rationing their dwindling supply of munitions.


How US can quickly move weapons


When an aid package for Ukraine is announced, the weapons are either provided through presidential drawdown authority, which allows the military to immediately pull from its stockpiles, or through security assistance, which funds longer-term contracts with the defense industry to obtain the systems.


The presidential drawdown authority, or PDA, as it's known, has allowed the military to send billions of dollars' worth of ammunition, air defense missile launchers, tanks, vehicles and other equipment to Ukraine.


"In the past, we've seen weapons transferred via presidential drawdown authority arrive within a matter of days," said Brad Bowman, director at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies center on military and political power.


Those stocks are pulled from bases or storage facilities in the U.S. or from European sites where the U.S. has surged weapons to cut down on the amount of time it will take to deliver them once the funding is approved.


Storage in US


The military has massive weapons storage facilities in the U.S. for millions of rounds of munitions of all sizes that would be ready to use in case of war.


For example, the McAlester Army Ammunition Plant in Oklahoma sprawls across more than 16,000 hectares connected by rail and has a mission to surge as many as 435 shipping containers — each able to carry 15 tons worth of munitions — if ordered by the president.


The facility is also a major storage site for one of the most used munitions on Ukraine's battlefield, 155 mm howitzer rounds.


The demand by Ukraine for that particular shell has put pressure on U.S. stockpiles and pushed the military to see where else it could get them. As a result, tens of thousands of 155 mm rounds have been shipped back from South Korea to McAlester to be retrofitted for Ukraine.


Storage in Europe


According to a U.S. military official, the U.S. would be able to send certain munitions "almost immediately" to Ukraine because storehouses exist in Europe.


Among the weapons that could go very quickly are the 155 mm rounds and other artillery, along with some air defense munitions. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss preparations not yet made public.


A host of sites across Germany, Poland and other European allies also are helping Ukraine maintain and train on systems sent to the front. For example, Germany set up a maintenance hub for Kyiv's Leopard 2 tank fleet in Poland, near the Ukrainian border.


The nearby maintenance hubs hasten the turnaround time to get needed repairs done on the Western systems.
