id="how-to-install-windows-11-on-supported-and-unsupported-pcs-24h2-edition">How
to install Windows 11 on supported and unsupported PCs, 24H2
edition</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>We’ve pulled together all kinds of resources to create a
comprehensive guide to installing and upgrading to Windows 11. This
includes advice and some step-by-step instructions for turning on
officially required features like your TPM and Secure Boot, as well as
official and unofficial ways to skirt the system-requirement checks on
“unsupported” PCs, because Microsoft is not your parent and therefore
cannot tell you what to do. There are some changes in the 24H2 update
that will keep you from running it on every ancient system that could
run Windows 10, and there are new hardware requirements for some of the
operating system’s new generative AI features. We’ve updated our guide
with everything you need to know. ↫ Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica In
the before time, the things you needed to do to make Windows somewhat
usable mostly came down to installing applications replicating features
other operating systems had been enjoying for decades, but as time went
on and Windows 10 came out, users now also had to deal with disabling a
ton of telemetry, deleting preinstalled adware, dodge the various dark
patterns around Edge, and more. You have wonder if it was all worth it,
but alas, Windows 10 at least looked like Windows, if you squinted. With
Windows 11, Microsoft really ramped up the steps users have to take to
make it usable. There’s all of the above, but now you also have to deal
with an ever-increasing number of ads, even more upsells and Edge dark
patterns, even more data gathering, and the various hacks you have to
employ to install it on perfectly fine and capable hardware. With
Windows 10’s support ending next year, a lot of users are in a rough
spot, since they can’t install Windows 11 without resorting to hacks,
and they can’t keep using Windows 10 if they want to keep getting
updates. And here comes 24H2, which makes it all even worse. Not only
have various avenues to make Windows 11 installable on capable hardware
been closed, it also piles on a whole bunch of “AI” garbage, and
accompanying upsells and dark patterns, Windows users are going to have
to deal with. Who doesn’t want Copilot regurgitating nonsense in their
operating system’s search tool, or have Paint strongly suggest it will
“improve” your quick doodle to illustrate something to a friend with
that unique AI Style™ we all love and enjoy so much? Stay strong out
there, Windows folks. Maybe it’ll get better. We’re rooting for you.</p>

<h2 id="the-costs-of-the-i386-to-x86-64-upgrade">The costs of the i386
to x86-64 upgrade</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>If you read my previous article on DOS memory models, you may have
dismissed everything I wrote as “legacy cruft from the 1990s that nobody
cares about any longer”. After all, computers have evolved from sporting
8-bit processors to 64-bit processors and, on the way, the amount of
memory that these computers can leverage has grown orders of magnitude:
the 8086, a 16-bit machine with a 20-bit address space, could only use
1MB of memory while today’s 64-bit machines can theoretically access
16EB. All of this growth has been in service of ever-growing programs.
But… even if programs are now more sophisticated than they were before,
do they all really require access to a 64-bit address space? Has the
growth from 8 to 64 bits been a net positive in performance terms? Let’s
try to answer those questions to find some very surprising answers. But
first, some theory. ↫ Julio Merino It’s not quite weekend yet, but I’m
still calling this some light reading for the weekend.</p>

id="android-15s-security-and-privacy-features-are-the-updates-highlight">Android
15’s security and privacy features are the update’s highlight</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>Android 15 started rolling out to Pixel devices Tuesday and will
arrive, through various third-party efforts, on other Android devices at
some point. There is always a bunch of little changes to discover in an
Android release, whether by reading, poking around, or letting your
phone show you 25 new things after it restarts. In Android 15, some of
the most notable involve making your device less appealing to snoops and
thieves and more secure against the kids to whom you hand your phone to
keep them quiet at dinner. There are also smart fixes for screen
sharing, OTP codes, and cellular hacking prevention, but details about
them are spread across Google’s own docs and blogs and various news
site’s reports. ↫ Kevin Purdy at Ars Technica It’s a welcome collection
of changes and features to better align Android’ theft and personal
privacy protection with how thieves steal phones in this day and age.
I’m not sure I understand all of them, though – the Private Space, where
you can drop applications to lock them behind an additional pin code,
confuses me, since everyone can see it’s there. I assumed Private Space
would also give people in vulnerable positions – victims of abuse,
journalists, dissidents, etc. – the option to truly hide parts of their
life to protect their safety, but it doesn’t seem to work that way.
Android 15 will also use “AI” to recognise when a device is yanked out
of your hands and lock it instantly, which is a great use case for “AI”
that actually benefits people. Of course, it will be even more useful
once thieves are aware this feature exists, so that they won’t even try
to steal your phone in the first place, but since this is Android, it’ll
be a while before Android 15 makes its way to enough users for it to
matter.</p>

it with a sentence like this: "And that's why I have a blog." It plants
a seed, which through repetition and appearing in many places, might
help people appreciate the purpose of a blog. We've had a lot of mud

Anniversary Meetup</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-17, from: Innessential (Brint Simmons’ blog)</p>
<p>
This Thursday, Oct. 17, 2024, is the 20th anniversary of the Seattle
Xcoders! We’d love to see you there, at 7 pm at
<a href="https://www.bbycballard.com/">Bale Breaker and Yonder Cider
taproom</a> in Ballard.
</p>
<p>
Everyone is welcome! It’s not just for people who write code — it’s for
designers, testers, support folks, and everyone who helps make
Apple-ecosystem apps. Even if you just <em>like</em> those kinds of apps
and like talking about them, come join us!
</p>
<p>
We’re usually outside by these propane fire things, but I’m not sure
this time — we might have a room or some area or something. We should be
easy to find, at any rate.
</p>
<p>
It’s not actually a meeting with presentations — it’s just hanging out
and talking. Which we do every first, third, and fifth Thursday (you can
<a href="webcal://p25-caldav.icloud.com/published/2/Nzc2ODExNzg3NzY4MTE3OA8zb_qUej-fZsXG-_oJak3bJvjP8RcHmIEZ0WxGu2kWkvciKC5Sm6Xm5sHZRUHdZPM3KQg8-b2iwsMIEOTWlJo">subscribe
to our calendar</a>). One of these days we’ll get back to presentations
— but the social part is valuable, and so we keep it up.
</p>
<p>
PS Looks like the food truck is Impeckable Chicken, which I’ve heard
good things about. :)
</p>
<p>
PPS I’m usually easy to spot: quite well into middle age, with nothing
like the amount of hair I once had. Black jeans, usually a black
sweatshirt. Glasses. Doc Martens. Not tall.

tunneling</p>
<p>When you’re away from home it’s not only convenient, but often
necessary to connect back to your machines. This could be to connect to
a remote VSCode instance, run a backup, check on a process, or to debug
a problem. SSH can also be used to port-forward services, or to copy
files with scp or rsync.</p>

2020</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-17, from: Lean Rada’s blog</p>
<p>
tl;dr: use <code>place-content: center</code> on a <code>grid</code>
container.
</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> grid<span>;</span>
  <span>place-content</span><span>:</span> center<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>
Here’s how that looks like:
</p>
div child
<p>
That’s it. Two CSS rules.
</p>
<p>
Yes, four years late according to <em>caniuse</em>. But this is
apparently still not well-known today.
</p>
<p>
Based on
<a target="_blank" href="https://build-your-own.org/blog/20240813_css_vertical_center/">recent
developments<span>🡵</span></a>, looks like we just need a few more years
before we can finally get rid of the extra <code>display</code> rule so
we can have the one CSS rule to center them all.
