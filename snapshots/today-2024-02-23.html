<h2 id="chinese-companies-hit-by-us-eu-sanctions-on-russia">Chinese
Companies Hit by US, EU Sanctions on Russia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>London — U.S. and European Union sanctions announced Friday on
hundreds of people and companies for supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine
included several companies from China.</p>
<p>While most sanctions were against Russians and Russian firms, the
U.S. and EU measures also included Chinese individuals and companies
based in mainland China cities as well as Hong Kong for supplying the
Russian military.</p>
<p>The U.S. sanctions also targeted individuals and firms based in
Kazakhstan, Liechtenstein, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, while
the EU also targeted individuals and entities based in India,
Kazakhstan, Serbia, Sri Lanka and Turkey.</p>
<p>They also included sanctions against Russian prison officials over
the suspicious death last week in a Russian prison of opposition leader
Alexey Navalny.</p>
<p>Russia’s foreign ministry denounced the sanctions as “illegal” and
said it would respond by banning some EU citizens who provided military
assistance to Ukraine from entering Russia.</p>
<p>Chinese officials did not issue an immediate response to the
sanctions. But, at a regular briefing Tuesday, China’s foreign ministry
spokesperson Mao Ning commented on the expected sanctions saying China
follows an “objective and impartial position on the Ukraine crisis” and
has “worked actively to promote peace talks.”</p>
<p>She said they “have not sat idly by, still less exploited the
situation for selfish gains.”</p>
<p>Ukrainian officials and media reports have accused Chinese companies
of supplying key electronics and dual-use technologies, including drone
components, to Russia’s military since its invasion of Ukraine two years
ago, which Beijing has denied.</p>
<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday
preempted Friday’s official announcement on social media, saying, “I
welcome the agreement on our 13th sanctions package against Russia. We
must keep degrading Putin’s war machine. With 2000 listings in total, we
keep the pressure high on the Kremlin. We are also further cutting
Russia’s access to drones.”</p>
<p>The sanctioned individuals and companies are banned from doing
business with U.S. or European firms.</p>
<p>But legal and political analysts disagree on the effectiveness of the
sanctions.</p>
<p>Lawyer Mark Handley, a partner at the Philadelphia-headquartered law
firm Duane Morris LLP, said being sanctioned will certainly affect their
international business. “Things like international insurance companies
or shipping could get very complicated once they are on the sanctions
list.”</p>
<p>However, Pieter Cleppe, editor-in-chief for BrusselsReport.eu, told
VOA, “Historical research has shown that sanctions mostly fail,
especially when prolonged, as is the case with Russia. The targeted
country learns to cope with them.”</p>
<p>He said, “While sanctions may impoverish ordinary Russians, they have
failed to halt the Russian offensive, which should be the goal.”</p>
<p>The Yermak-McFaul International Working Group on Russian Sanctions
and the Ukrainian think tank KSE Institute in January published a report
showing sanctioned technology has still been reaching Russia’s military
through third country intermediaries, which the EU and the U.S. hope the
fresh measures will stop.</p>
<p>Despite the historic sanctions, Russia’s economy has been resilient
as it shifted from European trade to doing more business and selling
more oil to Moscow-friendly nations such as India, Brazil and China.</p>
<p>Junhua Zhang, senior assistant researcher at the Brussels-based
European Institute for Asian Studies, said the EU’s highest expectation
“is for China to align with the EU in resisting Russia’s aggression,
which is unrealistic. The EU’s minimum expectation is for Chinese
companies not to work for Russia, but strictly speaking, only fools
would have such an expectation.”</p>
<p>“Just consider, [Chinese President] Xi Jinping sees Putin as his best
friend, and those below him will act accordingly, a point that Europeans
also recognize.”</p>
<p>Others argue that sanctions on Chinese firms could push Beijing to
reconsider.</p>
<p>Aliona Hlivco, a former Ukrainian lawmaker and managing director at
the London-based think tank the Henry Jackson Society, said sanctions
against Chinese companies could prove useful in deterring Russia’s war
on Ukraine. “China is currently attempting to improve relations with the
West, so reinforcing China’s compliance with international norms could
be opportune.”</p>
<p>The EU is China’s second-largest trading bloc partner after the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations.</p>
<p>China Customs says China-EU bilateral trade value was $783 billion in
2023, a year-on-year decrease of 7.6%.</p>
<p>In the same year, while Russia lost most of its European market due
to sanctions, the bilateral trade between China and Russia hit a record
high of $240 billion, a year-on-year increase of 26.3%. </p>
<p>Trade between the U.S. and China in 2023 fell for the first time
since 2019, by 11% to $664 billion, according to customs data, and the
Commerce Department says the United States imported more goods from
Mexico than China for the first time in 20 years.</p>

<p>The thing about promises is that in Silicon Valley, accountability
rarely shows up. Investors put in over $100 billion into the driverless

(and empty predictions) were made at essentially no cost to those who
made them. So what if Elon made bad predictions year after year? Nobody

China Discuss Russia-North Korea Cooperation, Says State Department</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — A top U.S. official on North Korea held a video call
this week with China’s envoy on Korean Peninsula affairs in which they
discussed the growing military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang,
the State Department said Friday.</p>
<p>The U.S. senior official for North Korea, Jung Pak, and her Chinese
counterpart, Liu Xiaoming, also addressed North Korea’s “increasingly
destabilizing and escalatory behavior,” the department said in a
statement.</p>
<p>It said the growing military cooperation between Russia and North
Korea was “in violation of numerous U.N. Security Council
resolutions.”</p>
<p>Russia has long been party to U.N. sanctions on North Korea over the
latter’s ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs but has stepped
up ties with Pyongyang since invading Ukraine in 2022.</p>
<p>The United States has accused North Korea of supplying Russia with
artillery shells and missiles used in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Moscow and Pyongyang deny the accusations but vowed last year to
deepen military relations.</p>
<p>The State Department said the video call followed a February 16
meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chinese
Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Munich at which they “affirmed the
importance of continued communication on [North Korea] issues at all
levels.”</p>
<p>The Kremlin on Tuesday said Russian President Vladimir Putin had
given North Korean leader Kim Jong Un a Russian Aurus limousine as a
gift. On Friday, Washington imposed sanctions on the producer of the car
as part of a sweeping round of sanctions against Russia over the death
of opposition leader Alexey Navalny and to mark the second anniversary
of the invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The sanctions and trade restrictions also targeted Chinese firms that
the U.S. said were assisting Russia’s war.</p>
<p>Sino-U.S. relations have shown signs of improvement in recent months
with steps to reestablish communication channels after ties sank to
their lowest levels in decades.</p>
<p>But many points of friction remain, including U.S. sanctions on China
over security and human rights issues. China said Wang told Blinken in
Munich that these should be lifted.</p>
<p>The top U.S. official for arms control, Bonnie Jenkins, told an event
on Thursday that Washington was keen for more talks with China on
strategic stability and crisis management and that a more aggressive
North Korea was not in Beijing’s interest.</p>
<p>She said she believed North Korea, which borders China, is keen to
acquire fighter aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, armored vehicles,
ballistic missile production equipment or materials and other advanced
technologies from its cooperation with Russia.</p>

Slaps 500 New Sanctions on Russia over War, Navalny Death</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday announced a
significant sanctions escalation against Russia, targeting its financial
system and military infrastructure with over 500 new penalties, marking
the largest tranche of sanctions since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine
nearly two years ago.</p>
<p>The measure was announced ahead of the invasion’s anniversary on
Saturday and followed the death of Russian opposition leader Alexey
Navalny in a penal colony in the Arctic earlier this month.</p>
<p>The sanctions target various sectors, including Russia’s state-owned
National Payment Card System, banks, investment firms, venture capital
funds and other financial institutions, its defense industry and
procurement networks. They also target individuals involved in evading
sanctions, in Russia and abroad, as well as prison officials who
Washington believes to be linked to Navalny’s death.</p>
<p>Urging lawmakers in the House of Representatives to pass the $95
billion Senate-approved supplemental funding measure that includes
additional military aid for Kyiv, Biden vowed to respond with further
punishment for Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>“We in the United States are going to continue to ensure that Putin
pays a price for his aggression abroad and repression at home,” he said
Friday. Failure to do so, he warned, would embolden further aggression
in Ukraine and worldwide.</p>
<p>Since Moscow’s invasion, Washington and its allies have imposed
sanctions on thousands of Russian targets. Friday’s package includes
nearly 300 people and entities targeted by the U.S. Treasury Department,
as well as 250 people and entities targeted by the State Department. The
Commerce Department added over 90 companies to the entity list.</p>
<p>However, simply adding individuals and companies with no links to the
United States and arguably with limited links to the world outside of
Russia at large is ineffectual, said Dalibor Rohac, a senior fellow at
the American Enterprise Institute.</p>
<p>Instead, the administration should better coordinate with allies to
prevent existing sanctions evasion, especially for those related to oil
revenue, Rohac told VOA.</p>
<p>“And a seizing of Russia’s sovereign assets overseas — particularly
its central bank reserves,” Rohac said.</p>
<p>Beginning in December 2022, the U.S. and its allies imposed a $60 per
barrel cap on Russian oil, limiting services such as insurance and trade
finance for shipping Russian oil sold above that price.</p>
<p>According to a Treasury Department analysis released Friday, the cap
has reduced Russia’s oil income. Over the past month, the policy forced
Russia to discount its oil by $19 per barrel.</p>
<p>The cap, combined with a European Union ban on nearly all Russian oil
imports, was designed to choke funding to Putin’s war machine. However,
countries can still legally buy Moscow’s crude if it is refined
elsewhere, including in Turkey and India.</p>
<p>“As long as Russia can continue to sell their oil, they’ll be able to
continue buying missiles, and bullets and pay for soldiers,” William
Browder, head of the Global Magnitsky Justice Campaign, told VOA. “As
long as we allow that, then this war is never going to end.”</p>
<p>Earlier this week the EU also slapped Moscow with a new round of
sanctions, focusing on fighting sanctions evasion by targeting companies
around the world accused of providing Russia with advanced technology
and military goods.</p>
<p>Nearly 200 people and entities, mostly from Russia, have been added
to the entity list, now totaling more than 2,000 individuals and
entities.</p>
<p>For the first time, the EU sanctions are hitting companies in
mainland China suspected of helping the Kremlin. Companies from India,
Turkey, Serbia, Kazakhstan, Singapore, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Hong Kong
are also targeted.</p>

<h2 id="trump-haley-and-the-climate-primary-that-wasnt">Trump, Haley,
and the Climate Primary That Wasn’t</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-23, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTU0NzAzNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NDk3MjA4Mn0.b-BaIfyPgl0pUGE543cfzrwtSzM3NycnpXmK9QRIeHQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
As a climate-concerned citizen, one of the most discouraging things
about Donald Trump’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-biden-lng-fight" target="_self">all-but-inevitable
confirmation</a> as the 2024 Republican presidential nominee has been
thinking about parallel universes.
</p>
<p>
I don’t just mean the ones where the conservative Supreme Court has a
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/08/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-ballot.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shocking
change of heart</a> and disqualifies him from the presidential ballot,
or where Nikki Haley,
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/feb/23/election-updates-south-carolina-primary-trump-haley-politics-latest" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">against
all odds</a>, manages to win her home state primary on Saturday and
carry the momentum forward to clinch the Republican nomination. I’m
talking about an even greater fantasy: A world in which Trump doesn’t
dominate the news cycle, in which South Carolina conservatives have a
real debate about the energy transition, and in which the climate
conversation
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self">hasn’t
been set back years</a> by culture war-mongering and MAGAism.
</p>
<p>
Laugh, sure, but squint and you can almost see it. South Carolina, where
the 2024 campaign heads this weekend, is unique among early primary
states for having a conservative base that is potentially more open to
climate-related issues than people in Iowa or even Nevada. Though the
state tracks closely with the opinions of
<a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/partisan-maps-2018/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
average American Republican</a> on things like risk perception of global
warming and policy support for green issues like regulating CO2 and
renewable energy, South Carolina voters have also elected several
conservative politicians unusual in their openness toward climate
issues. Senator Lindsey Graham, who’s held his office since 2003, has
been described as
“<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/lindsey-graham-too-green-energy-for-gop-116660" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">too
green for the GOP</a>,” once even
<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2009/10/graham-works-with-kerry-on-climate-bill-028158" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">working</a>
with then-Senator John Kerry on a climate bill that would have capped
greenhouse gas emissions. Even Haley, the state’s former governor, broke
with most of the 2024 Republican primary field by
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2023/presidential-candidates-2024-policies-issues/nikki-haley-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saying
she believes</a> human activity is causing climate change and worsening
extreme weather.
</p>
<p>
Graham and Haley’s environmental records
<a href="https://whistleblower.org/uncategorized/hell-and-high-water-the-perils-of-climate-denial-politics-south-carolina-as-a-case-example/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">are
far, far from ideal</a>. Still, their unlikely receptiveness to at least
<em>some</em> climate science seems to suggest a constituency with a
certain level of open-mindedness about green policies. The polls appear
to back this up, too: In
<a href="https://columbiabusinessreport.com/new-poll-finds-growing-support-for-south-carolinas-clean-energy-economy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
summer 2023 study</a> by Conservatives for Clean Energy-South Carolina,
more than seven in 10 general election voters in the Palmetto State said
they support the continued development of renewable clean energy; the
same number said they believe in climate change.
</p>
<p>
Again, this is only natural when you look at what’s
<a href="https://www.cleaninvestmentmonitor.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">happening
in the state</a>. The Inflation Reduction Act is expected to bring
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-facts-impact-investing-america-agenda-south-carolina" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an
estimated $15 billion in investment</a> in clean energy and storage to
South Carolina by 2030, in the form of things like
<a href="https://www.wfae.org/energy-environment/2023-03-22/two-new-ev-battery-related-plants-are-coming-to-south-carolina" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EV
battery plants</a>,
<a href="https://www.wltx.com/article/news/local/south-carolinas-solar-energy-grow/101-5f057d16-c6d8-4ef9-af26-9d8bc9b02e24" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">73
solar companies</a>, and a lithium processing facility that
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy-supply-chain/new-south-carolina-plant-could-process-enough-lithium-for-2-4m-evs-a-year" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claims
it will produce</a> enough material to support the manufacturing of an
estimated 2.4 million EVs per year — that is, 200,000 more than were
sold in the U.S.
<a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q4-2023-ev-sales/#:~:text=Data%20Point-,A%20Record%201.2%20Million%20EVs%20Were%20Sold%20in%20the%20U.S.,Estimates%20from%20Kelley%20Blue%20Book" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in
all of 2023</a>.
</p>
<p>
South Carolina also stands out in the southeast as being
<a href="https://www.southernenvironment.org/news/south-carolina-leads-the-region-in-proactive-climate-planning/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">particularly
forward-thinking</a> about climate resilience; it’s hard to live in the
state and <em>not</em> have extreme weather at the top of your mind.
Some 210,000 South Carolinians live in flood-prone areas, the Southern
Environmental Law Center reports, and homeowners insurance is
increasingly
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/hurricane-idalia-georgia-south-carolina-insurance" target="_self">difficult
to come by or afford</a>. The state also sits squarely in the path of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/hurricanes-rapid-intensification-andra-garner" target="_self">intensifying
Atlantic hurricanes</a>. All of this might seem incongruous with local
Republican voters’ middling levels of climate concern, but as writer and
professor Susan Crawford
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/charleston-climate-change-flooding" target="_self">told
Heatmap last year</a>, “At the state level, certainly, you’re better off
not talking about the human causes of climate change” — even as you’re
quietly addressing them.
</p>
<p>
The absence of climate from the primary conversation isn’t just because
of the damage that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/nikki-haley-ron-desantis-fracking-environmentalist-gop-debate" target="_self">being
called an environmentalist</a> does to a Republican’s reputation in the
year 2024, though. An early-season primary debate even
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/even-a-republican-debate-has-to-cover-climate-change-in-2023" target="_self">acknowledged</a>
that the climate issue has become so big that Republicans ought to be
discussing it. But because Trump is the party’s frontrunner, any
conversation about climate, clean-energy jobs, or resilience was over
before it could start. While Trump has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change" target="_self">hardly
been shy</a> about attacking EVs and “the green new scam,” his rants are
reductive, making
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/2024-election-climate-trump" target="_self">climate
a negative buzzword</a> rather than a policy issue that can be debated.
Haley has spent her time and energy
<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/22/in-south-carolina-haley-is-running-hard-on-russia-00142552" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">focusing
on Trump’s scandals</a> and deflecting his attacks rather than talking
about what South Carolinians have to lose if Trump guts the IRA
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self">as
he intends</a>.
</p>
<p>
That’s not to say Haley is some great defender of the climate agenda;
<a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/01/new-hampshire-nikki-haley-climate-paris-agreement-withdrawl-trump-hoax/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">she
isn’t</a>, and needless to say, it’s never good when <em>Rex
Tillerson</em> is the one on the right side of an issue from you, as he
was when he defended the Paris Agreement against the then-U.N.
ambassador’s calls to extract the U.S. from it. But the shame is that
Trump has
<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/02/23/south-carolina-primary-identity-politics-00142777" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">snuffed
out any sort of conservative debate</a> about the climate in South
Carolina before it could even begin.
</p>
<p>
Dwelling on the would’ve- and could’ve-beens, of course, is a fool’s
errand of which I’m now wholly guilty. <em>This</em> is the reality:
Trump is
<a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/republican-primary/2024/south-carolina" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">queued
up for another win</a> on Saturday, one that will effectively be the
nail in the coffin of the Haley campaign even if she’s
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/nikki-haley-wont-drop-out-as-long-as-donors-keep-giving.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vowed</a>
not to drop out of the race. Voters won’t decide the next four years of
the climate agenda in the U.S. tomorrow — that happens 255 days from
now, in November. That means the timeline still isn’t fixed, but boy, it
sure feels that way.

‘OOF…!!’ That Cursed Word Kids Never Say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-23, from: The Signal</p>

<p>RICHMOND, VIRGINIA — Four foreign nationals were arrested and charged
Thursday with transporting suspected Iranian-made weapons on a vessel
intercepted by U.S. naval forces in the Arabian Sea last month. Two Navy
SEALs died during the mission.</p>
<p>The criminal complaint unsealed Thursday in U.S. District Court in
Richmond alleges that the four defendants — who were all carrying
Pakistani identification cards — were transporting suspected
Iranian-made missile components for the type of weapons used by Houthi
rebel forces in recent attacks.</p>
<p>“The flow of missiles and other advanced weaponry from Iran to Houthi
rebel forces in Yemen threatens the people and interests of America and
our partners in the region,” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in
a news release.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said that Navy Special Warfare Operator 1st Class
Christopher J. Chambers was boarding the boat on January 11 and slipped
into the gap created by high waves between the vessel and the SEALs’
combatant craft. As Chambers fell, Navy Special Warfare Operator 2nd
Class Nathan Gage Ingram jumped in to try to save him, according to U.S.
officials familiar with what happened.</p>
<p>“Two Navy SEALs tragically lost their lives in the operation that
thwarted the defendants charged today from allegedly smuggling
Iranian-made weapons that the Houthis could have used to target American
forces and threaten freedom of navigation and a vital artery for
commerce,” Monaco said.</p>
<p>Attorney General Merrick B. Garland pledged that the Justice
Department “will use every legal authority to hold accountable those who
facilitate the flow of weapons from Iran to Houthi rebel forces, Hamas,
and other groups that endanger the security of the United States and our
allies.”</p>
<p>Muhammad Pahlawan is charged with attempting to smuggle advanced
missile components, including a warhead he is accused of knowing would
be used by the Houthi rebels against commercial and naval vessels in the
Red Sea and surrounding waters. He is also charged with providing false
information to U.S. Coast Guard officers during the boarding of the
vessel.</p>
<p>Pahlawan’s co-defendants — Mohammad Mazhar, Ghufran Ullah and Izhar
Muhammad — also were charged with providing false information.</p>
<p>Pahlawan’s attorney, Assistant Supervisory Federal Public Defender
Amy Austin, said Pahlawan had an initial appearance in U.S. District
Court Thursday and is scheduled to be back in court Tuesday for a
detention hearing. She declined to comment on the case.</p>
<p>“Right now, he’s just charged with two crimes and we’re just at the
very beginning stages, and so all we know is what’s in the complaint,”
Austin said when reached by phone Thursday.</p>
<p>According to prosecutors, Navy forces boarded a small, unflagged
vessel, described as a dhow, and encountered 14 people on the ship on
the night of January 11, in the Arabian Sea off the Somali coast.</p>
<p>Navy forces searched the dhow and found what prosecutors say was
Iranian-made weapons, including components for medium range ballistic
missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles.</p>
<p>All 14 sailors on the dhow were brought onto the USS Lewis B. Puller
after Navy forces determined the dhow was not seaworthy. They were then
brought back to Virginia, where criminal charges were filed against four
and material witness warrants were filed against the other 10.</p>
<p>According to an FBI affidavit, Navy forces were entitled to board the
ship because they were conducting an authorized “flag verification” to
determine the country where the dhow was registered.</p>
<p>The dhow was determined to be flying without a flag and was therefore
deemed a “vessel without nationality” that was subject to U.S. law, the
affidavit states.</p>
<p>According to the affidavit, the sailors on the dhow admitted they had
departed from Iran, although at least one of the men initially insisted
they departed from Pakistan.</p>
<p>The affidavit states that crew members had been in contact multiple
times by satellite phone with a member of Iran’s paramilitary
Revolutionary Guard.</p>

It’s been a month since I last posted about the category theory project,
so a quick update  — and the end really is in sight! I’ve just put
online another revised version of Category Theory I. Little has changed
except for some more corrections of typos (with particular thanks to
Georg Meyer) and a few small […]

<p>
LLM Agents can Autonomously Hack Websites
</p>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have
become increasingly capable and can now interact with tools (i.e., call
functions), read documents, and recursively call themselves. As a
result, these LLMs can now function autonomously as agents. With the
rise in capabilities of these agents, recent work has speculated on how
LLM agents would affect cybersecurity. However, not much is known about
the offensive capabilities of LLM agents.
</p>
<p>
In this work, we show that LLM agents can autonomously hack websites,
performing tasks as complex as blind database schema extraction and SQL
injections without human feedback. Importantly, the agent does not need
to know the vulnerability beforehand. This capability is uniquely
enabled by frontier models that are highly capable of tool use and
leveraging extended context. Namely, we show that GPT-4 is capable of
such hacks, but existing open-source models are not. Finally, we show
that GPT-4 is capable of autonomously finding vulnerabilities in
websites in the wild. Our findings raise questions about the widespread
deployment of LLMs…

<em>This is a transcript of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-3-inflation-reduction-act" target="_blank">episode
three</a> of Shift Key: Is Biden’s Climate Law Actually Working?</em>
</p>
<p>
ROBINSON MEYER: Hi, I’m Rob Meyer. I’m the founding executive editor of
Heatmap News and you are listening to Shift Key, a new podcast about
climate change and the shift away from fossil fuels from Heatmap. My
co-host Jesse Jenkins will join us in a second and we’ll get on with the
show. But first a word from our sponsor.
</p>
<p>
[AD BREAK]
</p>
<p>
MEYER: Hi, I’m Robinson Meyer. I’m the founding executive editor of
Heatmap News.
</p>
<p>
JESSE JENKINS: And I’m Jesse Jenkins, a professor at Princeton
University and an expert in energy systems.
</p>
<p>
MEYER: And you are listening to Shift Key, the new podcast about climate
change and the energy transition from Heatmap News. On today’s show,
we’re going to talk about how the IRA,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/the-inflation-reduction-act-remains-astonishing" target="_self">the
Inflation Reduction Act</a>, President Joe Biden’s big climate law
passed in 2022, how it’s working, whether it’s working. We have new data
to shine light on this extremely important question. And we also are
going to do as always our upshift and downshift, our thing that gave us
hope this week and our thing that maybe has us feeling a little down. So
Jesse, ready?
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: I’m ready. Let’s dig in.
</p>
<p>
MEYER: Let’s get into it. In August 2022, President Joe Biden signed the
Inflation Reduction Act, the IRA. It’s the largest climate law in
American history and arguably in global history. And it threw the full
financial power of the US federal government behind decarbonization,
directing more than $500 billion in grants and tax credits toward
replacing old dirty fossil fuel infrastructure with new clean zero
carbon technologies. Now, when it passed, modeling, including from the
<a href="https://repeatproject.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">REPEAT
Project</a>, which is a collaboration of ZERO Lab at Princeton
University, led by my co-host Jesse Jenkins and Evolved Energy Research,
a consulting firm, suggested that the law would cut US greenhouse gas
emissions 37 to 41% by 2030. And I should say this research when it came
out was a big deal. You don’t have to take my word for it. The ZERO
lab’s work was cited in the <em>Guardian</em> and the <em>New York
Times</em>, by the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, by legislators and by
the White House itself.
</p>
<p>
And it wasn’t the only kind of piece of energy modeling that we used to
figure out how big a deal the IRA was. There were other reports, one
from an organization called the Rhodium Group and another from a
nonprofit called Energy Innovation. Now those reports really, I think at
the time, helped us understand just how big a deal this law was going to
be. We’re now just about 18 months after the Inflation Reduction Act has
been signed. And that means we’re getting to a point where we can see
the impact of this legislation. We can start to see whether it’s
working. And the REPEAT project, in conjunction with the Rhodium Group,
MIT and Energy Innovation — all the groups that did this research last
time have gone and conducted the first analysis of whether the law is
working — our kind of first midstream assessment, 18 months in, of
whether the IRA is actually reducing emissions and decarbonizing the
economy like we hoped that it would. So that’s what we’re gonna talk
about on the show. The first real analysis of whether Biden’s climate
law is cutting greenhouse gas emissions, with my co-host Jesse Jenkins,
one of the researchers who helped us understand its potential in the
first place. So Jesse, I actually want to start by backing up slightly.
And before we get into this new data that you have that talks about, you
know, whether the law is working, let’s start with this: how is the IRA
supposed to work?
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: The IRA is effectively
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/inflation-reduction-act-solar-panels-heat-pumps" target="_self">putting
clean energy on sale for all Americans</a>. That’s how it’s supposed to
work. It is a set of financial incentives that effectively drop the cost
of just about any action you would want to take to help accelerate the
clean energy transition by, you know, somewhere in the order of 20 to
50%. So it’s a little bit like you know, Black Friday shopping deals or
Cyber Monday or whatever your favorite sale is. It’s, you know, using
the federal purse to make it easier and a smarter financial decision for
households or businesses or utilities or whoever else to just make the
greener investment or purchasing decision over the dirtier one.
</p>
<p>
And it’s really quite comprehensive. It involves a set of incentives
that cut across really all of the major emitting sectors of the economy.
But in particular, all of our modeling from REPEAT Project and our
colleagues at Energy innovation and Rhodium Group, indicated that the
biggest emissions reductions over the next decade, in particular, would
come from the power sector, electricity generation, and the
transportation sector, particularly the uptake of electric vehicles.
</p>
<p>
These are two trends that were already underway before passage of the
Inflation Reduction Act. And what we’re looking for is evidence that
those trends have basically been supercharged by the incentives provided
in the act.
</p>
<p>
MEYER: And luckily my understanding is that those are exactly the two
sectors we have new data on today. Is that right?
</p>
<p>
JENKINS:
</p>
<p>
That’s right. So yeah, this should be a terrifying moment for any
modeler — when we get to check our modeling projections against reality.
But we did just that. We have data from 2023 now, courtesy of the Clean
Investment Monitor Project. If you go to cleaninvestmentmonitor.org, you
can check out this data yourself. This is a joint project of the MIT
Center for Energy Economic Policy Research and the Rhodium Group. This
is led in part by Brian Deese, who is one of the chief economic advisors
to President Biden and one of the key architects of the series of laws
passed in the last Congress. He was the chair of the National Economic
Council and is now an innovation fellow at MIT in helping lead this
project.
</p>
<p>
And what it’s doing is, it’s basically giving us as close to real time a
look at the progress of the clean economy in the United States as I
think we can get. It’s basically updated every quarter and it’s tracking
all of the public and private investments in actuality as well as
announced projects, that kind of as a leading indicator of what’s coming
in the future across most of the major sectors that we’re talking about
here. It’s a really helpful data set to gauge our progress. So what we
did was we took that data on zero emissions vehicle adoption — so EVs
and fuel cell vehicles and plug in hybrids and clean electricity
capacity additions — and compared that to what each of our three
modeling groups were estimating was likely to happen after passage of
the Inflation Reduction Act, and I should add the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law as well, which we were modeling you know back in
2022. So now we have year end 2023 data and the question is, how well
are we tracking at least in this first year out from passage of those
major laws?
</p>
<p>
MEYER: I wanna talk in a second about how confident we are that the
signal that we’re seeing in the data is actually the IRA or the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, like how confident we are in the
Bidenomics signal. But first, let’s do the moment of truth. Let’s just
first get to the data. So in the power sector, what do we see?
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: What we see in the electricity sector is a new record set for
zero carbon electricity generation and storage capacity additions.
That’s new power plant and battery storage construction. In aggregate,
we saw over 32,000 megawatts or 32 gigawatts of new zero carbon
generation and storage added to the US grid in 2023. That’s about a 32%
increase from the rate in 2022. And it edges out a previous record that
we saw in 2021 of about 31.6 gigawatts.
</p>
<p>
So good news is we’re setting new record growth rates in total in terms
of wind and solar and battery additions. Unfortunately, that does fall
on the lower end of what we were projecting in most of the modeling
results. We were looking for on average about 46 to 79 gigawatts. So
call it, you know, 40 to 80 gigawatts on average of additions in 2023
and 2024. And we fell short of the low end of that range right at 32.3
gigawatts. And so, unless the pace accelerates substantially in 2024,
we’re probably going to fall a bit behind schedule in terms of capacity
additions.
</p>
<p>
MEYER: And do we have a sense of what’s driving that? Because I think
that’s a very surprising finding, that we’re behind schedule in the
power sector where I think people feel pretty good generally about the
pace of decarbonization or I think where the common wisdom at least is
that the pace of decarbonization is like proceeding apace. What’s
driving this underperformance of the model?
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: So it’s really the difference between solar and wind additions.
The solar sector added about 18.4 gigawatts of capacity in 2023. That’s
up massively from just about 11 gigawatts in 2022. It’s about double
what we had seen in 2020 which was kind of our reference when we were
doing our modeling as we started the REPEAT project in 2021. And so
that’s looking encouraging and in fact, is running ahead of schedule
with the average pace of additions that we saw in REPEAT project
results.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/battery-storage-solar-transmission-handmer" target="_self">Batteries
are growing way faster</a> than we expected. And that helps really make
the most of those solar capacity additions because solar and batteries
are kind of like peanut butter and jelly, they go together quite well.
And that’s because solar has this nice, regular daily fluctuation,
right? From the sun rising and setting. And that pairs really well with
batteries, which today in a way lithium ion batteries are best suited
for, you know, only a few hours of storage. So they’ll charge for three
or four hours in the middle of the day when we’ve got an abundance of
sun. And then they’ll discharge in the evening to help meet the evening
peak of demand when everybody’s coming home from work.
</p>
<p>
The batteries basically helped shift the solar output from the middle of
the day to hit that evening peak. And that’s, that’s really helpful.
</p>
<p>
Where things are running behind schedule is really in the wind sector,
where we only built about half of the peak rate, actually less than
half, that we’ve seen historically in 2023. Additions of wind power in
2023 were only about 6.3 gigawatts, and that’s down from nearly 15
gigawatts in each of 2020 and 2021.
</p>
<p>
So that’s a step backwards at a time when we should be smashing new
record growth rates across all of these sectors. And that’s giving me
the biggest concern as we look at in the next couple of years.
</p>
<p>
MEYER: And that’s, I mean,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-two-offshore-wind" target="_self">last
show we talked about offshore wind</a> and the troubles in offshore wind
and how it seems like some big offshore wind projects that we thought
might be coming online in the middle of this decade might not be coming
online till the end of the decade. But when we talk about wind
underperforming in terms of the whole country over the past year, we’re
really still talking about onshore wind. This is like big turbines in
the middle of the Great Plains, not big turbines off the coast of New
York, New Jersey, right?
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: That’s right. Yeah, I think I don’t think we had any
significant offshore wind capacity additions coming in 2024. You know,
most of that we were expecting would come in between 2026 and 2030 or
2035. So this is really a story about onshore wind, where if we look at
the economics of onshore wind across the country, there’s a tremendous
number of sites that look very economic given the incentives provided by
the Inflation Reduction Act.
</p>
<p>
And unfortunately, we’re just not building out at the pace that would be
economically justified. And that is really an indicator that there are a
substantial number of other non-economic frictions or barriers to
deployment of wind in particular at the pace that we want to see.
</p>
<p>
MEYER: Before we go on, I just want to make it clear—
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: Maybe it’s worth pausing and unpacking what those incentives
look like. But the main one is what’s known as a production tax credit
that provides a payment of tax credits for every megawatt hour of clean
electricity produced over the first 10 years of operations from a new
facility. And that credit is worth about $28 per megawatt hour, which is
getting pretty close to the average wholesale revenue that you would get
just from selling your electricity. So it’s basically doubling roughly,
or maybe it’s an 80% increase, the revenues that a wind or solar
facility gets during its first 10 years of operation. And that is a huge
boost in terms of the return on investment that people are seeing. And
so that is the incentives that the IRA expanded and extended into the
long term, you can increase it even further than that, if you meet
domestic content requirements or build in so-called energy communities.
And so it could be an even larger incentive worth up to 20% more than
that if you meet both of those requirements.
</p>
<p>
MEYER: I was going to say, the back of the envelope number I usually
hear is like a 5% increase in interest rates, is like a doubling of
project cost. But if you’re doubling project revenue, that actually
suggests that yes, we’re seeing some big non-economic factors hold up
offshore wind.
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: Yeah, so it’s definitely true that the increase in interest
rates is sucking up some of what would have been the kind of financial
tailwinds provided by the Inflation Reduction Act. And that’s why I’m
eager to see what our new round of modeling results looks like. But the
other, I think data point here is that, you know, batteries and solar
are also 100% capital investments just like wind. And so interest rates
would affect all of them equally in many ways. So there has to be
something unique to the wind industry here that’s holding the wind
sector back while solar and batteries set new growth records. I have my
speculation as to what that is, I think it’s, you know, three factors
and I have no idea, you know what proportion we can assign to each of
them.
</p>
<p>
One of the first things that’s I think unique about the wind sector is
that it was facing the full expiration of that production tax credit
that I was mentioning. So prior to passage of the Inflation Reduction
Act, which extended this credit for the long term out through into the
2030’s. We’ve had this on again, off again history with the production
tax credit of expirations every few years. It’s been around since 1994
but it’s not a permanent part of the tax code. And so every few years,
it’s up for renewal.
</p>
<p>
But unlike the ITC, the investment tax credit that was supporting solar
previously, which was also on a ramp down but was still in place when
the IRA passed, the production tax credit had entirely phased out for
projects that commenced construction after the end of 2021. At that
point, it had been reduced to only 60% of its full value. So if you
wanted to get the full value, you had to finish or start construction by
the end of 2019.
</p>
<p>
And I think we can see that in the data, what that did was that pulled
forward the project pipeline, the development pipeline, and encouraged
everyone if they could to start their construction by the end of 2019 in
order to lock in the full value of that production tax credit. And
that’s why I think we saw record build outs in 2020 and 2021 because
everybody was finishing projects that they commenced in 2019 in order to
get the full value of the credit.
</p>
<p>
MEYER: You think the first factor here is like maybe a pipeline problem,
so to speak, where a ton of projects started in the pipeline in 2019,
they were completed in 2020 or 2021, and now we’re in this fallow period
where the projects that started after the IRA passed aren’t complete
yet, so we don’t see them showing up.
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: That’s exactly right. So that’s the first factor. So if that’s
an issue, then what we would expect to see is that the project pipeline
is large now and that we would see more projects coming in 2024 and 2025
that were started as the IRA was passed.
</p>
<p>
Now the other factor that’s, I think, a little bit more unique to wind
is also the impacts of the supply chain disruptions that we saw around
COVID, and the increase in labor costs, particularly in Western
countries. And that’s because the solar sector and batteries are
dominated by China and other Asian manufacturing bases. Whereas wind is
really still a Western-produced technology, most of the wind
manufacturing is in Europe or the United States.
</p>
<p>
That’s partly because these are such big components, wind turbines,
missiles and towers and blades are massive. And so there’s less
advantage of shipping them around the world. You want to build them
closer to where you need them. And so we maintain more of a
manufacturing base. I think something like two thirds of all of the
content of wind turbines built in the US were manufactured here, whereas
we only build about 5% of the solar PV modules in the US in terms of
their domestic content right now. So I think that’s important because
what we saw was, you know, a very different pandemic response, right, in
Europe and the US versus China where China largely kept its
manufacturing going for most of the pandemic. Whereas the US had, you
know, these disruptions and Europe had these disruptions from lockdowns.
</p>
<p>
We had more rapid inflation, you know, labor costs were going up. And so
all of that I think hit the wind industry harder than it hit batteries
and solar PV. We see that in the real costs of these projects. So for
the first time, we saw real cost increases for all of the technologies
we’re talking about: wind, solar and batteries. But already in 2023
costs are back down for modules, solar PV modules and battery packs, but
they’re still up for wind. So I think that’s an important factor too.
</p>
<p>
MEYER: It’s not only that China kept the factories going, it’s that even
in the post pandemic moment— I feel like this is such an important
aspect of how the global economy is working right now that hasn’t been
fully understood— the US did a ton of demand support macro-economically.
Not electricity demand, but I mean, we sent checks to people, we did
expanded employment, we made sure the consumers kept spending. China
really did so much less of that. And so China’s pathway to growing its
economy to the level that it hopes to grow it right now is entirely
through expanding exports and trade.
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: And so no wonder they were pumping the supply side up, right?
</p>
<p>
MEYER: All their support has gone to the supply side. And then
furthermore, there’s just like this structural support to the supply
side because Chinese consumers are in such poor condition, basically,
that they have to export things they make is their only possibility of
breaking even and growing the economy.
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: Yeah, for now, at least. I’m sure we’ll come back to talk about
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ford-gm-stellantis-byd" target="_self">China’s
transition soon</a>. So I would say those two factors are hopefully
transitory, right? The sort of supply shocks are fading. The inflation
is ebbing and we should be rebuilding the pipeline.
</p>
<p>
The third factor is the one that keeps me up at night. And that’s just
that I worry that wind is just much more difficult to site and much more
transmission-dependent than solar and batteries are.
</p>
<p>
And that’s kind of a function of the physics of wind power, which is
interesting. Wind speeds and solar radiation, you know, kind of vary
about proportionally. The best wind sites in the country are about twice
as good as the worst wind sites. And that’s true for solar too, like the
best solar sites in Arizona or New Mexico have about twice the resource
quality as you know, Maine or, you know, somewhere else in New England.
And that makes sense because the physics of the wind is driven largely
by the impacts of the sun heating different parts of the planet
differentially and that moves pressure and temperature around and that
drives the wind.
</p>
<p>
The big difference is that solar panels convert sunlight or insulation
into electricity kind of proportionally to the resource quality. So a
linearly one for one kind of relationship, whereas wind turbines convert
wind speeds to wind power at the wind speed cubed. So if you double the
wind speed, you get about an 8x increase in the wind power generation.
And what that does is it makes wind much more site-dependent than solar,
right? If you have a good wind speed site, you’re not just a little bit
better than a bad wind speed site, you’re <em>way</em> better. And so
the best, most economic, you know, attractive projects, they have to be
where it’s really windy.
</p>
<p>
And that means they don’t have as much flexibility about where to build
and those windy locations, you know, right up and down the middle of the
Great Plains, for example, tend to be a lot further from where most
people live. And so they’re also much more dependent on transmission to
site those projects than solar projects, where you can kind of move
around pretty freely across a broad area without really sacrificing much
in terms of resource quality. And therefore you can pick a site that’s
easier to build, that has less local opposition, that happens to be
closer to a transmission line. Maybe you lose 3-5% of your, you know,
power output by picking that easy-to-develop-site over maybe the best
one around. But it’s just not that big a difference whereas for wind, it
really could make or break a project.
</p>
<p>
MEYER: Last question, then I want to move on to EVs, because that’s so
interesting. But how much does solar and batteries need to overperform
to make up for this issue we’re seeing with wind?
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: So if wind can’t really get back on the same track as it was in
2020 and 2021 where we’re building at least 15 gigawatts a year and kind
of growing steadily from there, then it’s true that solar and batteries
are going to have to step up and kind of fill the gap.
</p>
<p>
And I think there’s a chance that could happen if we look at the results
kind of extrapolating out a bit further beyond 2023. We in the REPEAT
project are estimating about 26 gigawatts a year of solar additions
between now and 2026. So 2023 through 2026, and about 15 gigawatts a
year of wind. And so if wind can only do eight or seven, you would have
to see solar growing at maybe 35 or 40 gigawatts a year.
</p>
<p>
And that’s actually exactly what the US Energy Information
Administration is projecting for the solar sector over the next couple
of years. They’re projecting that in 2024, we’ll build about 44
gigawatts of utility scale solar, of both utility and distributed solar,
I should say, and about a similar amount in 2025. And so there’s a
chance that we actually could see solar kind of over-performing and
making up for wind being a laggard and that kind of gets us through the
next couple of years. But the growth rate just has to keep smashing new
records every year from here on out. And I don’t think we can really do
that if we’re dependent only on solar and batteries, we need both wind
and solar pulling their weight. And
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/offshore-wind-2024-outlook" target="_self">if
the wind industry can’t pick things back up</a>, I think we’re probably
gonna fall short of the targets that we were seeing in our modeling.
</p>
<p>
[AD BREAK]
</p>
<p>
MEYER: I want to move now to the other sector that your new research
looked at, which is EVs, transportation, vehicles. What is happening in
the US vehicle sector?
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: Yeah, this is one where it’s funny, you know, you mentioned
that I think most people have pretty good vibes about the power sector
but maybe there’s some warning signs that wind is lagging. I think we’ve
seen a lot of bad vibes on the EV sector
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/are-ev-sales-really-slowing-data" target="_self">as
I wrote for Heatmap a while back.</a>
</p>
<p>
MEYER: It’s nothing but bad vibes right now!
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: Yeah, it’s just all bad vibes. And yet this is the sector that
is unequivocally on track, at least compared to our modeling— maybe not
compared to Ford or GM’s sales growth projections— but as a sector,
compared to our modeling from REPEAT project, as well as Rhodium and
Energy Innovation, the EV transition is actually moving at about the
pace that we expected. And that’s probably likely to be true for the
next several years also, not just for 2023.
</p>
<p>
MEYER: I just wanted to pause and put a pin in this point because it
shocked me when I saw the initial report and I think it is so important.
In the power sector, I feel like it’s mostly good vibes right now. Like
people have a sense that the power sector is decarbonizing at roughly
the pace we need. That seemingly is not true! In the electric car
sector, in EVs, there’s a sense that like EVs are in trouble, the
transition is in danger, things aren’t going well, it’s not going as
well as the Biden administration wants or thought it would. And in fact,
it’s going basically at the pace we thought it would happen.
</p>
<p>
I just think this is such an important, interesting thing because it is
completely the opposite of, if you’re just reading the paper, it’s
completely the opposite of what you would think.
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: Yeah. And maybe this reflects just that our modeling groups
were a little bit more conservative than individual car companies were
in their sales growth projections. But we look at new technology
adoption and we typically apply an S-curve to that adoption where
they’re growing at double-digit compound annual growth rates at the
beginning. But then they hit, usually, a linear phase where they’re
growing at a pretty steep rate but it’s a straight line rather than
continuing to bend upwards like an exponential curve. And what that
means is that you would expect the annual growth rates, the percentage
growth, to be declining even as the absolute sales growth is increasing
because you’re building on a much bigger base, right? You know, adding
20% to a million vehicles is easier than adding 20% to 5 million
vehicles, right?
</p>
<p>
MEYER: I mean, this is like a version of the Facebook problem, right?
Where eventually just enough humans are Facebook users that Facebook has
to find other ways to make money. It can’t just keep adding new humans
every quarter.
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: Exactly. So we all modeled these uptake rates pretty similarly
as this kind of S-curve where we expected growth to be strong. We
expected, I think, supply chain constraints on the production side to
persist a bit longer than they did in reality. So that’s an interesting
divergence from at least our kind of underlying thinking at REPEAT. We
thought that it would be harder to ramp up manufacturing capacity as
quickly as the auto industry has.
</p>
<p>
MEYER: Huh!
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: But in general, you know, we are expecting to see what we saw.
Actually it’s interesting, in 2023, we actually saw the annual growth
rate go up. In 2022, the growth rate for zero-emissions vehicles, and
that includes EVs and plug-in hybrids as well as fuel cells (although
they’re a rounding error) went up by about 43%, 44% in 2022. And that
growth rate <em>accelerated</em> in 2023 to 52%. So despite all the
vibes about slowing growth, there’s actually no evidence of that, at
least on an annual basis. 2023 grew <em>faster</em> in compound annual
growth terms, percentage growth terms, than 2022. But we would expect
that growth rate to decline. None of our modeling is expecting a 50%
annual growth rate from every year. We would hit 100% sales in just a
matter of a few years if that were the case.
</p>
<p>
Instead, we’re expecting the growth rate in 2024 to 2026 to be somewhere
between 30 and 44% and to fall even further to somewhere between about
15 and 27% from 2027 to 2030. You know, exactly following that S-curve
where the annual growth rate is declining as we hit that linear phase.
</p>
<p>
MEYER: I just want to be clear, this is in the absence of any
technology-forcing policy, like new EPA rules that say you have to sell
a certain number of EVs per year.
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: We do include the states that have been following California in
adopting the Advanced Clean Cars to standard, which is their requirement
that by 2035, 100% of vehicles need to be zero-emissions vehicles,
vehicles sold, I should say in 2035 need to be zero-emissions vehicles.
And so we had included at the state level, some states like that,
there’s about a dozen that are following in that direction. That’s maybe
30% or so of the overall vehicle market in the US. So it’s not
inconsequential, but it’s not the only thing going on. I think we all
expect that 2024 will see a slowdown from 2023. But again, that’s in
line with what we expected in our modeling.
</p>
<p>
What’s actually really interesting, at least from the REPEAT side, is
that hybrids, both plug-in hybrids and just regular hybrid electrics,
are far
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/phevs-2024-plug-in-hybrids" target="_self">outselling
our projections</a> from our modeling.
</p>
<p>
MEYER: The IRA has incentives for some plug-in hybrid vehicles, but it
has no incentives for regular hybrid vehicles. Is that right?
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: That’s right. Yeah, that’s right. And that’s kind of what we
expected was that basically hybrids would kind of give way to EVs, and
that seems to be not what we’re seeing. We’re seeing that actually,
they’re kind of additive, particularly hybrids. Where last year, I think
we mentioned this
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast" target="_self">on an earlier
show</a>, we sold about as many hybrid electric vehicles as we did
battery electric vehicles about 1.1 or 1.2 million of each of them, and
that is <em>way</em> higher than what we expected. I think we only
expected about a 1 or 2% sale share, which is about where we were in
2019.
</p>
<p>
And instead hybrid electric vehicles have just grown right alongside EV
growth, and that’s encouraging from an emissions perspective because
those hybrids are emitting about 40% less per mile traveled, probably,
than an equivalent sized internal combustion car.
</p>
<p>
MEYER: They’re also going to then go have a long life as a used car,
continuing to reduce emissions.
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: So from a climate perspective, every internal combustion engine
vehicle that’s sold that’s a hybrid instead of a regular one, that’s a
win.
</p>
<p>
MEYER: It is funny because I feel like on the one hand, this is
surprising. And on the other hand, I can think of multiple new car
consumers, like in my life, friends I know, who were buying a new car in
the past two years and were EV-curious, they looked at EVs. They kind of
quickly decided there were none in their price range or there were none
that needed exactly what they needed them to do. And so then they bought
a hybrid.
</p>
<p>
Why did they buy a hybrid? Well, because they wanted to buy an EV, and
they couldn’t find one they liked. So they bought a hybrid because they
felt like that was on the path of the transition, which is not really a
rational consumer behavior as I think you would expect from a model. But
on the other hand, kind of makes sense from a certain flavor of like,
“Oh, well, I wanna help with this, but I can’t buy an EV yet, so I’m
gonna buy a hybrid.”
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: Yeah, I mean that was my mental model too because I think
that’s how you think about it. If you’re segmenting the market, there’s
a certain amount of consumer who cares about the environment, they care
about the cost of fueling their vehicle or both. And so they’re looking
at a hybrid versus a plug-in hybrid versus an EV, and they’re going to
fall in that range. And our expectation was that the large incentives
provided for EVs would basically shift the consumer from a hybrid to the
EV. But it looks like either that’s not what’s happening or there’s a
larger market out there for EVs than even we anticipated, and it’s just
that right now that market is still being split between hybrids and EVs.
</p>
<p>
But there’s basically twice as many consumers interested in one of those
than we thought, right? Because we sold about 2.2 million hybrids and
battery electric vehicles, you know, whereas we were only expecting, you
know, a few 100,000 hybrids and then around that many EVs. So, you know,
there’s a million extra consumers out there that we didn’t think would
be there in the market in 2023. And again, my thinking was, look, a
plug-in hybrid vehicle is always going to be more expensive than a
battery electric or an internal combustion car because it’s just, both
drivetrains crammed into the same vehicle.
</p>
<p>
MEYER: Right.
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: It’s got a pretty big battery, not as big as an EV, but it’s a
pretty good size one. It has to keep the internal combustion drivetrain
and add the electric motors, you know, and so it’s gonna be relative.
It’s always gonna be a cost premium over an internal combustion car.
Whereas a battery electric vehicle, they’re getting cheaper and cheaper
every year and there’s gonna be a point before too long where even the
upfront cost is lower. I think the cost of ownership is already at
parity, but you’re gonna go to the dealership and it’s just gonna be
cheaper to get in a battery electric car than a internal combustion car
because they’re simpler to build and they have less parts and batteries
are the biggest chunk of the cost and batteries keep getting cheaper
year after year.
</p>
<p>
MEYER: Yeah, there’s this argument you hear from Toyota executives,
which I’ve always taken as like 70% cope. Where they say, “Oh, well,
actually, you know, plug-in hybrids and regular hybrids make more sense
because as long as lithium and these minerals we need for the batteries
are scarce, you get more emissions reductions per ton of lithium or per
ounce of lithium or per ounce of cobalt, whatever, than you do with,
with a plug-in hybrid or a regular hybrid than you would with a pure
battery electric vehicle. Do you think that a plug-in hybrid is this
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/arguments-against-evs-bad" target="_self">range
anxiety security blanket</a> where you’re able to do a lot of your trips
plug-in but, whenever you need—
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: It depends on the size of the battery. Yeah, in some ways, the
plug-in hybrid is the ideal vehicle, right? If you had, you know, a 40
or 30 mile range, that covers most people’s daily commute, the all year
around town, driving to pick up the kids at soccer, school or whatever.
And then when you need to go on a road trip, you’ve got your gasoline
engine and you can go for as long as you want. So in some ways, it’s
kind of the ideal American car if you didn’t think about charging
infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
But of course, as we build out the charging infrastructure and as
batteries get cheaper, you know, BEVS get cheaper. I think it will make
sense for more and more people to just get rid of the gas part and you
don’t need the range extender. You know, we are a single car household.
We have one EV only and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/cool-ebikes" target="_self">our second car
is an e-bike</a>, for riding around town. You know, we put 20,000 miles
on our car since we bought it in November of 2022. And we’ve been on
many road trips and we had maybe one or two charging experiences that
were suboptimal.
</p>
<p>
MEYER: [laughs]
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: But like that is such a small part of my overall driving
experience on those 20,000 miles. Most of them, I just wake up in the
morning and my car is full with 280 miles, 290 miles of range. That’s
like enough for a week. And I never have to go to the gas station! The
convenience of that so outweighs the one or two frustrating experiences
in a long distance trip every year, that I think most people, once
they’re in a battery electric vehicle, they don’t miss the gas at all.
We’ve seen actually in recent consumer reports, trends that consumers
who have bought EVs are far more likely to buy a second EV than to go
back to internal combustion cars.
</p>
<p>
Toyota’s argument about lithium, I think is intellectually correct, I
should say, if you think that lithium is in finite supply. But go look
at lithium prices on the market right now. They’re in freefall. We are
<em>not</em> lithium constrained, right? So, I don’t know, it’s a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/toyota-prius-vw-audi-kia" target="_self">good,
nice ex post justification for Toyota’s strategy</a>. But basically what
Toyota did was they bet big on fuel cell vehicles and they’ve lost
massively. So they’re trying to recoup their position by doubling down
on the one area where they do have advantage, and that’s in hybrids and
plug-in hybrids.
</p>
<p>
MEYER: How would you look at this big— is Paris any good or not? Yes or
no, is the IRA working?
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: I would say yes, I think that we’re still within the cone of
growth for these sectors that we projected. So I don’t think there’s any
evidence that we’re off, you know, way off base yet.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/americas-carbon-emissions-fell-for-the-first-time-since-covid" target="_self">Emissions
did fall in 2023 as the economy expanded for the first time</a> since
the pandemic hit, it’s lower than what we projected in our modeling. So,
you know, again, it’s early. We should have mentioned this much earlier
on, but it’s hard to know— I think you alluded this actually in your
setup— how much signal there is here from the IRA.
</p>
<p>
MEYER: Yeah.
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: Because we spent most of the last 18 months writing tax credit
guidance and setting up new grant programs and issuing RFPs and
reviewing those and <em>most</em> of the money hasn’t actually gotten
out the door yet. And so, whatever we’re seeing now is just sort of like
the early stages of influence from these policies and where the
<em>real</em> signal is going to show up is in particularly 2025 and
2026 and 2027. When you have time to build a new factory, to install a
new wind farm, to expand our charging infrastructure, and really take
advantage of the credits and grant programs and others that were enacted
by these laws, which are really just starting to get out the door.
</p>
<p>
MEYER: One more observation, which is, it is crazy that hybrids
especially— I don’t want to keep going back to this and I feel like
again, we’re just seeding topics for a future conversation— but it is
crazy that hybrids are popping off during a year when gas prices did not
go up.
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: Yeah!
</p>
<p>
MEYER: Because I feel like in the past, what we’ve seen is the only
years where Americans don’t buy more SUVs, let’s say, than they did the
previous year, is in years like 2007 or 2022, when gas prices spike to
really high, you know, previously unprecedented levels. 2023, gas prices
went down.
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: Maybe the memory is still in people’s minds, maybe it’s the
inflation and the cost of living overall is still very salient for
people. And so the ability to save some money on your gas bill is still
helpful even if gas is not at its peak inflation levels.
</p>
<p>
I think the other factor is just that the upfront cost of buying a
hybrid has fallen so much that for many models, it’s just like a total
no brainer. I spend a few $100 more and I get a better car that has more
power and less fuel consumption. You know, it just makes a ton of sense
from an economic perspective.
</p>
<p>
MEYER: And I was thinking earlier that in some ways, the presence of
battery electric vehicles really defangs conventional hybrids because it
is no longer the “lib car.” I mean, I don’t think that cultural politics
are the entire driver here, but the presence of battery electric
vehicles as kind of the new “Democrat car” for lack of a more elegant
way of phrasing that particular cultural idea. Okay, what I’ve learned
from this is we need to do like 15 more episodes on cars and we need to
do another 15 more episodes on China’s macroeconomy and green
transition.
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: Alright, we got the next season lined out.
</p>
<p>
MEYER: Yeah, let’s do Upshift and Downshift. But first, let’s take a
break.
</p>
<p>
[AD BREAK]
</p>
<p>
MEYER: Okay, let’s do Upshift/Downshift. Jesse, what is your downshift
for the week?
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: So my downshift is one of the things that I think flew under
the radar for a lot of people, is that on February 15th, the US Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission approved a new pipeline from Texas to
Mexico that will export about 2.8 billion cubic feet of natural gas for
the purposes of supplying a new liquefied natural gas plant on the
Pacific coast of Mexico. You know, we talked in
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-1-lng" target="_self">our
first episode about the pause</a> that the Biden administration has put
on the review of new LNG export terminals in the US.
</p>
<p>
This is an export pipeline which I think falls under the same criteria
of, you know, having to decide whether it’s in the public interest or
not. And we just approved another 2.8 billion cubic feet of exports.
That’s like a quarter of all of our LNG exports today! And this is going
to go out as a pipeline, <em>not</em> as LNG, right. It’ll leave the US
in a pipeline but it will then go to the Pacific coast of Mexico where
it will supply a new $15 billion LNG terminal that is meant to supply
Asian markets, right? So the ability to get the gas to the Pacific Ocean
and then go from there to Asia is, you know, quite advantageous relative
to the Gulf coast terminals that we’re mostly talking about in the US.
</p>
<p>
So I just thought this was really interesting, I mean, we’ve had this
big debate in our first episode and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/lng-exports-pause-biden-emissions" target="_self">across
the energy sphere</a> about the role of exports in the US economy of
natural gas exports, and here’s this really massive pipeline that just
kind of snuck in under most people’s radar. I almost didn’t catch it.
But you know, big approval last week of a 2.8 billion cubic feet per day
gas export pipeline to Mexico. What’s let you down this week?
</p>
<p>
MEYER: I feel like I’m about to use a downshift that I will have to use
sparingly over the next few months. The presidential election, Jesse!
I’m not sure you’ve heard about it, but there’s a presidential election
in the United States of America in 2024. And it has me down. Ezra Klein
published a
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/opinion/ezra-klein-biden-audio-essay.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">really
interesting audio essay</a> this past week about calling for Biden to
step aside and for a Democratic Convention, an open Democratic
Convention later this summer to select a candidate. I think he counseled
something in that, which I thought was quite wise, which was that it’s
February and a lot of Democrats are acting very fatalistically about
their candidate, and that’s kind of absurd.
</p>
<p>
It’s February, it’s too late to get on the primary ballot in a lot of
states. But there’s still many months to go before the presidential
election and nothing is written. There’s still a lot of different
possibilities that could happen. It’s just that the outcome of the
presidential election is not yet secure. However, at this point, I think
it is important to say Biden is losing, which from a strictly climate
policy lens would be a <em>really</em> bad thing for climate policy.
</p>
<p>
And I think what has me most worried about this presidential election
and, and which I think, I hope that folks listening to this and folks
who were very angry at me when I posted the Ezra Klein essay— I don’t
know whether I agree with it, I’m not gonna take an advice standpoint
here— I will say that what has been so noticeable about the campaign so
far is the reluctance to use Biden and the reluctance to put Biden out
in public. And that the way to dispel public concerns, which seem to be
extremely widespread, understandably, about the president’s age, are to
have the president out there a lot, talking! Showing that he can
campaign, showing that he’s up to the task, and the fact that that has
not happened as much over the past two weeks and the fact that the
president is so unavailable— he’s done fewer press conferences than both
of his predecessors— I think should give a lot of folks who are
interested in US politics, even solely because of climate policy, a lot
of pause.
</p>
<p>
Well, let’s turn this around, and what’s your upshift?
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: My upshift is from
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/jeff-stein/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jeff
Stein at the <em>Washington Post</em></a> who is an economics reporter
there and has been doing some really interesting on-the-ground reporting
as to the impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act and other incentives in
these climate bills on, you know, local economies around the country.
And so he spent some time last week in Michigan with the United
Association Union of Plumbers and pipefitters in central Michigan. So
this is, you know, a union that does plumbing and HVAC technicians and
welding and pipe fitting. And what he found is that the demand for union
jobs there is just booming, driven largely by two massive new EV battery
plants that are under construction in Michigan, driven by the Inflation
Reduction Act and the incentives for domestic battery manufacturing that
the law provides, that includes both direct subsidies for manufacturing
EVs in the US, as well as tying some of the EV tax credits to the
sourcing of domestic or North American assembled batteries.
</p>
<p>
So it’s a straight line from the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act
to the employment boom that they’re talking about. He noted that
typically this union in central Michigan has fewer than 1000 members and
that these two plants <em>alone</em> could hire about
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/evs-trump-uaw-jobs-evidence" target="_self">500
full time jobs each from their union</a>. So the entire union would be
employed building these two battery plants. And clearly that’s gonna
create new jobs and new opportunities for union work and well-paid
family-supporting jobs in Michigan. I think that that story is playing
out across the country. That’s hopefully encouraging in the long term
for the politics of the clean energy transition because when people see
the clean energy transition as something that’s fueling their economic
future and not just as about avoiding scary future climate outcomes, I
think that has a strong amount of durability and a lot of political
salience.
</p>
<p>
MEYER: I am <em>so</em> curious though to see whether these— I mean,
unions are now, the federal government has passed a ton of policy that
increases demand for union workers, and like a lot of these unions have
to grow in a way they have not been asked to grow in a long time. And
I’m so curious to see how that happens.
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: So, what about you, Rob? Do you have something to close us out
on and keep us a little bit more positive than that electoral news?
</p>
<p>
MEYER: There’s a really interesting study that came out earlier this
month in the Journal <em>Earth’s Future</em> by Mallory L. Barnes et al,
she’s a scholar at Indiana University in Bloomington, that looked at
this question that I think has kind of hung over some climate data for a
long time, which is when you look at these global maps of temperature
rise and how much different parts of the planet have experienced global
warming, often the least amount of warming has happened in the Eastern
United States. And you’ll sometimes even hear this called “a warming
hole” that while the rest of the planet seems to be experiencing, you
know, varying levels of global warming and especially at the poles,
quite extreme levels of global warming, the Eastern US, which of course,
is this <em>extremely</em> important area, if you’re talking about
global climate policy, the Eastern US isn’t experiencing as much
warming, at least compared to other places in the world.
</p>
<p>
So what this study found, the study is called
“<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023EF003663" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A
Century of Reforestation Reduced Anthropogenic Warming in the Eastern
United States</a>.” What the study found is that basically in the
Southeast US, especially, a lot of land that used to be tillage or
farmland has since become reforested. And that reforestation drives
local cooling and that has mitigated a lot of the global warming we’d
otherwise expect to see, and that’s why recent temperatures have been
cooler than we might have expected with global warming. And so the
abstract says, “Ground and satellite-based observations showed that
Eastern United States forests cool the land service by 1 to 2 °C
annually compared to nearby grasslands and crop lands, with the
strongest cooling effect during midday in the growing season when
cooling is 2 to 5 °C.”
</p>
<p>
I just found that really fascinating. Of course, it raises lots of
adaptation questions like should we be doing more reforestation in other
places in order to generate local cooling in those places? Reforestation
has, while not a silver bullet by any means, does also have climate
benefits as well. You know, carbon cycle benefits. And so I just thought
that was such a cool study and while it might not be kind of encouraging
in the conventional sense in the same way that maybe yours was, I just
found it to be so engrossing. It made me think about processes being
connected to each other in ways I maybe hadn’t thought about before. I
thought it was really cool.

<p>
JENKINS: That is really fascinating. Those are not small effects. Those
are quite substantial. So that’s really quite interesting. I’m glad you
shared that. I’ve heard a lot of conversation about urban forestation as
an adaptation measure, right? Adding urban tree canopies does have
appreciable impacts on local heat island effects that you see in cities,
and that’s maybe an important area of adaptation policy. Some of my
colleagues here at Princeton are exploring those kinds of dynamics and
there’s a lot of interest there. But this is interesting. This is almost
continental scale effects, right?
</p>
<p>
MEYER: Exactly.
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: Across a broad region for reforestation, not just in cities.
So, wow, that’s, that’s really interesting. Thanks for sharing.
</p>
<p>
MEYER: Well, Jesse, I feel like we have so much here. There’s just like
10 different things we could talk about next week. And I know I want to
talk about China, I know I want to talk more about electric vehicles, I
want to talk about transportation policy, maybe reforestation.
</p>
<p>
JENKINS: Yeah, there is so much to unpack here on Shift Key. I hope you
all join us again next week as we dive in again.

<p class="drop-caps">
It’s an open secret in U.S. climate policy circles that the Inflation
Reduction Act got its name for purely political reasons. It’s a climate
bill, after all. Calling it “Inflation Reduction Act” was just the
marketing term to help sell it to a skeptical public more worried about
rising prices than temperatures in August 2022.
</p>
<p>
Temperatures have
<a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2024/01/12/eight-charts-illustrate-2023s-extreme-weather" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">only
risen since</a>, while
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/02/13/opinion/thepoint/inflation-wage-price-spiral?smid=url-share" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">inflation
is down</a>, and the Inflation Reduction Act had
<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/inflation-is-down-but-the-inflation-reduction-act-likely-doesnt-deserve-the-credit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nothing
to do with</a> either. But to see why the name was more than appropriate
only takes going back a further six months.
</p>
<p>
On February 24, 2022, Russian president Vladimir Putin launched a
full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In many ways, the step shouldn’t have
come as a surprise. The invasion followed
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/events-leading-up-russias-invasion-ukraine-2022-02-28/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">months
of saber-rattling</a>. It wasn’t even Putin’s first invasion of Ukraine
— that happened ten years earlier, with Russia’s forceful annexation of
Crimea. But Russia’s bombs raining down on Ukraine still came as a
shock. February 24 was a Thursday. By Sunday morning, Germany had
<a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/01/germanys-new-plans-for-transforming-its-defence-and.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">changed
75 years of pacifist defense strategy</a>. Another result of the
invasion: fossil energy price spikes.
</p>
<p>
Now, two years later, it has become clear that the shock of the war has
changed the trajectory of global energy <em>and</em> climate in ways
that we are only beginning to appreciate. It is also precisely where the
U.S. Inflation Reduction Act enters the picture, and why history will
judge the law — and its name — kindly. Let me explain.
</p>
<p>
Gas prices in Europe had already been high all winter before Russia’s
invasion, in part in response to Putin’s posturing. After the invasion,
they spiked. The peak happened in August 2022, in anticipation of the
Russian war lasting through the coming winter and worries about the war
dragging on. Drag on, of course, it did. Two years in, there’s no end to
the fighting in sight. Gas prices, meanwhile, are down again to levels
not seen since well before the invasion.
</p>

<iframe aria-label="Interactive line chart" data-external="1" frameborder="0" height="400" id="datawrapper-chart-CMOnW" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/CMOnW/1/" style="border: none;" title="Europe’s Gas Prices" width="680">
</iframe>
</center>
<p>
One key reason: demand is down. Europe’s gas demand was
<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-eurostat-news/w/ddn-20230419-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">down
almost 18%</a> in the first year after the invasion, compared to the
year before. Not all of that is good news, for the climate or otherwise.
One reason for decreased gas demand had been temporarily increased coal
use. Another is a
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/21/world/europe/small-businesses-sound-alarm-over-weakening-german-economy.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sputtering</a>
European economy.
</p>
<p>
The U.S. had been relatively insulated from these extreme fluctuations.
But it, too, saw gas prices spike in August 2022. The spike, to be
clear, was much lower than in Europe. Gas, unlike oil, is a regional
market. But the economic upshot was similar everywhere: massive
inflation driven by volatility in fossil fuel prices, or
“<a href="https://www.gwagner.com/fossilflation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>fossilflation</em></a>”
for short.
</p>
<p>
All of us, the global economy, and the fortunes of political leaders
everywhere are at the mercy of geopolitical vagaries. Putin blows a fuse
and invades Ukraine, and your gas bills spike – both types of “gas”
bills, by the way: gasoline to get to work, and methane gas to heat your
home. Electricity bills typically are not far behind, with gas-powered
plants that can be called upon at a moment’s notice providing a
necessary margin of safety during moments of peak demand. That means
that they — or, by extension, Putin, in this case — set the price.
</p>
<p>
Don’t take my word for it. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics unpacks
the underlying drivers of inflation into three main categories: food,
fuel, and everything else. Throughout the most recent U.S. spike in
inflation in 2022, the energy category alone was responsible for around
half of total inflation. And that’s just counting the direct effects.
Indirectly, a good portion of the food price increases ever since are
also due to higher energy costs. If the farmer pays more to harvest the
crop, soon those commodity prices increase as well. Of course, it isn’t
all fossil fuels. Putin’s invasion, for example, also impacted corn
production in the Ukraine directly, by destroying crop land, preventing
a timely harvest, and cutting off export routes.

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
There are two other climate-related factors that drive inflation — call
them “<em>climateflation</em>” and “<em>greenflation</em>,” to use
German economist Isabel Schnabel’s terms. Schnabel — a member of the
Executive Board of the European Central Bank, the body that sets
interest rates for the 340 million people in the Eurozone — introduced
all three -flationary terms in a March 2022 speech warning of
“<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2022/html/ecb.sp220317_2~dbb3582f0a.en.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
new age of energy inflation</a>.”
</p>
<p>
<em>Climateflation</em> is just what it sounds like: inflation because
of unmitigated climate change. When an extreme weather event wipes out a
country’s harvest of a particular crop, prices spike. One year it’s
avocados, the next
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/05/climate-crisis-drought-sugar-cost-impact" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sugar</a>,
and more significant food staples like corn, rice, and wheat are never
far behind. The long-term prescription, much like with
<em>fossilflation</em>: get off fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
None of that will happen overnight. That, in a sense, makes the IRA a
horrible political strategy with an eye toward the next election cycle.
Want to cut inflation quickly? Make gas and gasoline cheaper with direct
handouts. Hello,
<a href="https://gwagner.com/risky-climate-tax-holiday/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gas
tax holidays</a>!
</p>
<p>
The problem with that policy quick fix is that it’s just that: decidedly
short-term thinking. Fossil energy use will go up as a result. In fact,
several U.S. states and European countries have done just that in
response to Putin’s invasion. As a result, the average price paid per
ton of CO <sub>2</sub> has
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/12/opinion/carbon-emissions-ukraine-energy.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gone
down</a> in 2022, after a decade of steadily rising carbon prices the
world over.
</p>
<p>
The IRA famously does not establish a carbon price either, and that’s
A-OK. It does establish a
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/08/inflation-reduction-act-epa-carrots-sticks/671218/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$900-per-ton
price for methane</a> paid by oil and gas companies, but the law is
decidedly
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/inflation-reduction-act-carrots-sticks" target="_self">more
carrots than sticks</a>. That contrasts U.S. climate policy with what
has been the primary focus of the EU, with its emissions trading system
and national carbon taxes. It also addresses a more subtle type of
climate-related inflation: <em>greenflation</em>, upward pressure on
prices because of the rush to get off fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
The good news on that front: It seems to be true that there’s
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/science-green-technology-climate-and-environment-renewable-energy-141761657a8e7a5627a0e49e601dd48e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plenty</a>
of the kinds of precious metals and rare earth minerals we need to power
the low-carbon transition to go around. Polysilicon prices spiked for a
bit, before new supply came online, and solar panel prices never budged
from their decades-long, precipitous decline. Lithium, nickel, and other
minerals used in batteries and other low-carbon technologies similarly
rose for a bit before they, too,
<a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/02/15/investing-in-commodities-has-become-nightmarishly-difficult" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">declined
precipitously</a>.
</p>
<p>
The post-fossil fuel transition will still take plenty of active
management and proactive policy. That is where the U.S. IRA shines, and
where the EU, despite its head start and overall ambitious climate
policy, is playing catchup.
</p>
<p>
In May 2022, the European Union passed
<a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/repowereu-affordable-secure-and-sustainable-energy-europe_en#next-steps" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">REPowerEU</a>,
a broad set of measures to
<a href="https://gwagner.com/risky-climate-ukraine/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cut
off Russian gas</a> within five years. By September of that year, the EU
had cut Russian gas as a percentage of total gas piped in from abroad to
under 10%, down from over 40% a year prior. Germany built three LNG
import terminals in record time, and lots of other measures showed
almost immediate effect.
</p>
<p>
Overall, the EU is now racing to catch up with the U.S. in the global
climate race with its own set of ambitious supply-side measures in form
of a broad
<a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/green-deal-industrial-plan_en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Green
Deal Industrial Plan</a>. We should all applaud that transatlantic
climate policy competition and embrace the newly rekindled
<a href="https://gwagner.com/green-growth-mindset" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">green
growth mindset</a>. Done right, the planet will emerge as a winner, and
so will our economies.
</p>
<p>
The IRA
<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/inflation-is-down-but-the-inflation-reduction-act-likely-doesnt-deserve-the-credit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has
not</a> and will not cut inflation overnight. But that fight is indeed a
big part of the bill’s legacy: Play the long game of tackling all three
types of climate-related inflation — <em>fossilflation</em>,
<em>climateflation</em>, and <em>greenflation</em> — at their very core,
and indeed justify the law’s name.

(As Matt Webb noted, Chatbots have slid rapidly from Star Trek
(computers give you useful information in a timely fashion) to Douglas
Adams (computers spout hostile, impenetrable nonsense at you):
https://interconnected.org/home/2024/02/21/adams But beyond the
unsuitability of AI for search results and beyond the public’s yawning
indifference to AI-infused search, Broderick makes a more important
point: AI search is about summarizing web results so you don’t have to
click links and read the pages yourself. If that’s the future of the
web, who the fuck is going to write those pages that the summarizer
summarizes? What is the incentive, the business-model, the rational
explanation for predicting a world in which millions of us go on writing
web-pages, when the gatekeepers to the web have promised to rig the game
so that no one will ever visit those pages, or read what we’ve written
there, or even know it was us who wrote the underlying material the
summarizer just summarized? If we stop writing the web, AIs will have to
summarize each other, forming an inhuman centipede of botshit-ingestion.
This is bad news, because there’s pretty solid mathematical evidence
that training a bot on botshit makes it absolutely useless. Or, as the
authors of the paper – including the eminent cryptographer Ross Anderson
– put it, “using model-generated content in training causes irreversible
defects”: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17493 This is the mathematical
evidence for Jathan Sadowski’s “Hapsburg AI,” or, as the mathematicians
call it, “The Curse of Recursion” (new band-name just dropped). But if
you really have your heart set on living in a ruined dystopia dominated
by hostile artificial life-forms, have no fear. As Hamilton Nolan writes
in “Radical Capital,” a rogues gallery of worker-maiming corporations
have asked a court to rule that the NLRB can’t punish them for violating
labor law: https://www.hamiltonnolan.com/p/radical-capital Trader Joe’s,
Amazon, Starbucks and SpaceX have all made this argument to various
courts. If they prevail, then there will be no one in charge of
enforcing federal labor law. Yes, this will let these companies go on
ruining their workers’ lives, but more importantly, it will give carte
blanche to every other employer in the land. At one end of this process
is a boss who doesn’t want to recognize a union – and at the other end
are farmers dying of heat-stroke. The right wing coalition that has put
this demand before the court has all sorts of demands, from forced birth
to (I kid you not), the end of recreational sex:
https://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2024/02/getting-rid-of-birth-control-is-a-key-gop-agenda-item-for-the-second-trump-term
That coalition is backed by ultra-rich monopolists who want wreck the
nation that their rank-and-file useful idiots want to wreck your body.
These are the monopoly cheerleaders who gave us the abomination that is
the Pharmacy Benefit Manager – a useless intermediary that gets to screw
patients and pharmacists – and then let PBMs consolidate and merge with
pharmacy monopolists. One such inbred colossus is Change Healthcare, a
giant PBM that is, in turn, a mere tendril of United Healthcare, which
merged the company with Optum. The resulting system – held together with
spit and wishful thinking – has access to the health records of a third
of Americans and processes 15 billion prescriptions per day. Or rather,
it did process that amount – until the
all-your-eggs-in-one-badly-maintained basket strategy failed on
Wednesday, and Change’s systems went down due to an unspecified
“cybersecurity incident.” In the short term, this meant that tens of
millions of Americans who tried to refill their prescriptions were told
to either pay cash or come back later (if you don’t die first). That was
the first shoe dropping. The second shoe is the medical records of a
third of the country. Don’t worry, I’m sure those records are fine.
After all, nothing says security like “merging several disparate legacy
IT systems together while simultaneously laying off half your IT staff
as surplus to requirements and an impediment to extracting a special
dividend for the private equity owners who are, of course, widely
recognized as the world’s greatest information security practitioners.”
Look, not everything is terrible. Some computers are actually getting
better. Framework’s user-serviceable, super-rugged, easy-to-repair,
powerful laptops are the most exciting computers I’ve ever owned – or
broken: https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/13/graceful-failure/#frame Now
you can get one for $500!
https://frame.work/blog/first-framework-laptop-16-shipments-and-a-499-framework
And the next generation is turning our surprisingly well, despite all
our worst efforts. My kid – now 16! – and I just launched our latest
joint project, “The Sushi Chronicles,” a small website recording our
idiosyncratic scores for nearly every sushi restaurant in Burbank,
Glendale, Studio City and North Hollywood: https://sushichronicles.org/
This is the record of two years’ worth of Daughter-Daddy sushi nights
that started as a way to get my picky eater to try new things and has
turned into the highlight of my week. If you’re in the area and looking
for a nice piece of fish, give it a spin (also, we belatedly realized
that we’ve never reviewed our favorite place, Kuru Kuru in the CVS Plaza
on North Hollywood Way – we’ll be rectifying that soon). And yes, we
have a lavishly corrupt Supreme Court, but at least now everyone knows
it. Glenn Haumann’s even set up a Gofundme to raise money to bribe
Clarence Thomas (now deleted, alas):
https://www.gofundme.com/f/pzhj4q-the-clarence-thomas-signing-bonus-fund-give-now
The funds are intended as a “signing bonus” in the event that Thomas
takes up John Oliver on his offer of a $2.4m luxury RV and $1m/year for
life if he’ll resign from the court:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE-VJrdHMug This is truly one of
Oliver’s greatest bits, showcasing his mastery over the increasingly
vital art of turning abstruse technical issues into entertainment that
negates the performative complexity used by today’s greatest villains to
hide their misdeeds behind a Shield of Boringness (h/t Dana Clare). The
Bezzle is my contribution to turning abstruse scams into a high-impact
technothriller that pierces that Shield of Boringness. The key to this
is to master exposition, ignoring the (vastly overrated) rule that one
must “show, not tell.” Good exposition is hard to do, but when it works,
it’s amazing (as anyone who’s read Neal Stephenson’s 1,600-word
explanation of how to eat Cap’n Crunch cereal in Cryptonomicon can
attest). I wrote about this for Mary Robinette Kowal’s “My Favorite Bit”
this week:

Of course, an undisputed master of this form is Adam Conover, whose Adam
Ruins Everything show helped invent it. Adam is joining me on stage in
LA tomorrow night at Vroman’s at 5:30PM, to host me in a book-tour event
for my novel The Bezzle:

of the LA Sheriffs Deputies, who are organized into criminal gangs that
murder, run drugs and intimidate with impunity:

now, the thrilling conclusion! * * * Benedetto was outraged by my face
and swore he’d sue the Sheriff’s Department on my behalf. He got even
angrier when I got stopped again, the following week, as I was leaving
my concussion checkup at the Kaiser hospital on Sunset by a sheriff’s
deputy who had me pull over in front of the big Scientology building.
This deputy was a little bantam rooster of a fellow, with a shiny bald
head and mirror shades and no neck. He strutted up to my car, got me out
of it, ran my ID, and frisked me. “Do you know why I pulled you over,
sir?” he said. He had that cop knack for making “sir” sound like
“motherfucker.” “No, sir,” I said, trying it out myself. He didn’t like
that and leaned in close enough for me to smell his aftershave and the
scented sunscreen on his bare scalp. “I stopped you, sir, because you
were using your phone while driving.” I must have looked surprised. “I
personally saw you tapping at your phone screen. That is a misdemeanor,
sir. Reckless driving.” He stopped as if waiting for me to respond. I
made myself go mild. “Sir, I did not use my phone.” He was waiting for
that. He narrowed his eyes and leaned in closer. “Are you telling me I
didn’t see what I saw?” Mild, Marty, mild. “I don’t know what you saw,
sir, but I didn’t use my phone.” He rocked back and tilted his head.
Patients went by with crutches and walkers. Nurses and doctors passed in
scrubs. Scientologists scurried in and out of their gigantic temple. A
fruit cart man labored past us. “Well, sir, this should be simple enough
to resolve.” He reached for his belt and pulled out a generic ruggedized
cop-­rectangle of gear, and unspooled a multiheaded cable from its side.
He leaned into the rental and retrieved my phone, and squinted at its
I/O port, then attached the cable to my phone. The rugged rectangle
beeped. “I’m gathering forensics on your mobile device, sir,” he said.
I’d figured that out already. My phone—­like yours and ­everyone
else’s—­was a trove of my most intimate information, a record of all the
places I’d been and people I’d spoken to and all the things I’d said to
them. It was full of photos and passwords and client files and voice
memos. It was more information than any judge would have granted a
warrant for on a reckless-­driving rap. The little man smirked as he held
my phone and his gadget. I stayed mild as milk. I was running
full-­device encryption. I’m no computer security expert, but I spend a
lot of time around them, and they’d been insistent on this point, and
had made reference to this very scenario in describing why I would
bother to dig around my phone’s settings to turn this on. God, my face
hurt. I didn’t know how long the gadget was supposed to take, but from
the cop’s increasing impatience, I could tell it was going long. Beep.
The cop shaded the gadget’s little screen from the punishing LA sun with
one hand and peered at it. “Sir, I need you to unlock this device,
please.” My face hurt. Be mild, Marty. “I invoke my right to counsel,” I
said. He pursed his lips. “Sir, if you would please enter your unlock
code, we can verify whether your device is in use and we can both be on
our way.” “I invoke my right to remain silent.” I said it straight into
his bodycam. He sighed and looked irritated. I had known Benedetto for
so long that I had once had to dial his number from a landline. I’d long
ago memorized his office’s number, 1–­800-­LAWER4U. He’d bought it early,
back before 800 numbers got expensive, and he’d had plenty of offers for
it. He’d kept it. This day in history (permalink) #15yrsago Tonga Room,

id="across-la-college-papers-offer-student-reporters-a-connection-to-campus-community">Across
LA, College Papers Offer Student Reporters a Connection to Campus,
Community</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — For years, Marc Anthony Martinez worked delivery jobs in
Los Angeles and across the U.S.</p>
<p>One of his regular stops: the University of Southern California
village. Martinez, 33, says he would drop off food deliveries and wonder
what it would be like to go to school there.</p>
<p>“After a while I was like, ‘You know what? I write pretty good, I
love traveling, why don’t I try to go into journalism and try to become
a sports journalist?’” he said.</p>
<p>So in April 2022, Martinez enrolled in the journalism program at East
Los Angeles College.</p>
<p>Nearly two years on, Martinez is editor in chief for the community
college newspaper, Campus News.</p>
<p>Founded in 1945, Campus News has won several awards, including from
the Journalism Association of Community Colleges SoCal conference.</p>
<p>But before students can publish work in Campus News, they must take
the college’s Journalism 101 class.</p>
<p>Jean Stapleton, chairperson of the college journalism department and
adviser for Campus News, provides that training.</p>
<p>First comes a writing test, then classes on subjects such as how to
write news articles and on media ethics.</p>
<p>The emphasis, Martinez said, is on the responsibilities reporters
will have in their careers.</p>
<p>Entering his second semester at the newspaper, Martinez said that the
newspaper’s flexibility allows him to do his “own thing,” whether that
is drafting sports stories or exploring photojournalism.</p>
<p>A self-proclaimed introvert, Martinez says joining the newspaper also
provided opportunities to push himself outside of his comfort zone.</p>
<p>“That’s what I tell the other journalists, ‘Look I know its nerve
wracking but it’s also part of the thrill of journalism.’ You’re pushing
yourself and expanding your limits on how far you can go,” he said.</p>
<p>Journalism 101</p>
<p>In downtown Los Angeles, the Los Angeles City College newspaper team
takes a similar approach.</p>
<p>Sorina Szakacs, who is active with LACC’s The Collegian, says the
newspaper offers classes to improve students’ reporting skills.</p>
<p>Szakacs, who is now studying at Columbia University in New York,
graduated from LACC in 2019.</p>
<p>She still contributes to The Collegian as a reporter and editor, and
sometimes audits the college’s journalism classes.</p>
<p>The classes, she said, are demanding but help students know if they
are interested in pursuing a career in journalism.</p>
<p>“Once you’re working in the newspaper, you know what is expected of
you. By the time you finish, you know if journalism is the career for
you or not,” Szakacs said.</p>
<p>Students don’t just work on reporting and editing. They also help
with distribution, loading trucks with print copies that are delivered
to homes and businesses.</p>
<p>Szakacs recalls being on a distribution run and seeing people emerge
from their houses as soon as copies are dropped off.</p>
<p>Residents also will often write emails and letters or call with tips
and questions, which she says shows an interest in the newspaper as a
part of the community.</p>
<p>“There is a need for it. People are waiting for it,” she said.
“That’s why we write — for them.”</p>
<p>While The Collegian is part of the largest community college district
in the nation and covers a more extensive area, Campus News focuses on
more specific issues surrounding student issues and life on campus.</p>
<p>Martinez says he is interested in features about people on campus who
might otherwise be overlooked.</p>
<p>“We got to find people that we don’t necessarily know that are on our
campus,” he said.</p>
<p>He recalls approaching a student after seeing their drawings and
asking if they would be open to an interview.</p>
<p>More recently, a student pitched a story on a group that sets up and
breaks down equipment for sports games.</p>
<p>“That’s what makes our paper good. It shows recognition to those that
need it and deserve it,” Martinez said.</p>
<p>He finds that features display an appreciation toward community
members and help increase the visibility of Campus News. After a student
or teacher is featured in the paper, they often ask for copies of the
newspaper, he said.</p>
<p>“They’ll take a couple of copies for themselves and give it to their
families, and they’ll have it. That’s what keeps our paper going,” he
said.</p>
<p>But the student reporters sometimes run into challenges.</p>
<p>In May, the music department at LACC prohibited a photojournalist
from covering an event for the outgoing president, telling them it was a
private event.</p>
<p>Music department officials later said there had been a
“miscommunication.”</p>
<p>Later that month, the sheriff’s deputies who do campus security
confronted another student who was taking photos in common areas around
the music building.</p>
<p>Coverage of the incidents reached the Los Angeles Times and the
Student Press Law Center. Students also reported on it in The
Collegian.</p>
<p>Next generation</p>
<p>Both community colleges offer a strong foundation in media skills,
but the students are wary of the job market.</p>
<p>So far this year, the newspaper industry has seen a massive layoff at
the Los Angeles Times in January and at other U.S. newsrooms.</p>
<p>Martinez and Szakacs say that because many community college students
transfer to four-year universities, those who are committed to a career
in journalism will find ways to adapt.</p>
<p>For Szakacs, the situation made her hesitant to return to Los
Angeles.</p>
<p>Martinez says he isn’t as concerned for sports journalism or
photojournalism, but that his plans may change.</p>
<p>Szakacs said that as times change, so, too, should the industry.</p>
<p>Embracing technological advancements may help provide solutions for
journalism, she said.</p>
<p>Student journalists can be a part of that, she said. They can help
fill the gap of stories that major newspapers lack resources or interest
in reporting on.</p>
<p>“It’s not easy,” Szakacs said. “It’s never going to be easy, but
that’s what it means to be a journalist.”</p>

<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/21/024211.html">asked</a> if an
op-ed columnist at the NYT or WP would ever criticize their employer for
showing poor judgement on what to report on, esp re the election. I was
thinking of the
<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/4456879-special-counsel-describes-biden-as-elderly-man-with-a-poor-memory-in-eye-raising-report/">story</a>
about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Hur">special
prosecutor</a> who did something highly unethical in writing a public,
official, condemnation of someone he investigated yet decided not to
prosecute. We have judges and juries for that. Only in a police state
can a prosecutor pass judgement on an accused person. The news orgs took
the bait, I didn’t read one report on who
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Robert+K.+Hur">Robert K.
Hur</a> is, and the ethics of what he did. Is it appropriate to quote a
person who was behaving so openly unethically, esp if you don’t disclaim
that up front. It’s not that democracy is on the ballot this year, we’re
already over the line. Our journalism is acting as if it were already
controlled by the authoritarians. Our lack of trust in journalism is our
biggest problem. How can we force journalism to start to be a
<i>little</i> accountable. Right now they’re the only part of our ruling
class that theoretically can’t have their choices reviewed.</p>

I came up with a
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/22.html#a031907">motto</a> for Joe
Biden’s presidential campaign – Old Enough to Know Better.
</p>
<p>
I asked ChatGPT to draw a campaign rally with a banner that said that,
but it wouldn’t do it for Joe Biden, so I changed the name to Bull
Mancuso, and had him run for governor of Calif instead of president of
the US.
</p>
<p>
It still couldn’t spell the banner correctly but it <i>is</i> pretty
inspiring.

<li>Natural disasters displaced 2.5 million Americans last year

<p>
<strong></strong>Roughly 2.5 million people were displaced from their
homes due to natural disasters in 2023, according to new Census Bureau
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=438422f192&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">data</a>.
That number is an imprecise estimate, but it represents “some of the
best available numbers on displacement,”
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0a6f5c77f0&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>
<em>The New York Times</em>. Tracking this kind of displacement in
America can be hard, but it’s gotten slightly easier over the last two
years after the Census Bureau added questions about disasters to its
Household Pulse Survey in 2022. This year’s results show that Louisiana
saw the highest share of disaster-related displacements, followed by
Hawaii and Florida. Maine was also high on the list, likely due to
extreme

The data also suggested fraud runs rampant in the wake of natural
disasters, with more than half of those displaced saying they had
encountered a potential scam offer afterward. Last year America saw 28
weather and climate disasters, each costing at least $1 billion

<li>Vineyard Wind has 5 turbines up and running

turbine sending about five megawatts of electricity to the New England

four more turbines are up and running off the Massachusetts coast,
sending 68 megawatts of electricity to the grid, enough to power 30,000

<li>Researchers: Planting trees won’t solve the climate crisis
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>New
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d649284396&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research</a>
published in the journal <em>Science</em> finds that we’re
overestimating the cooling effect of forests by only focusing on carbon
dioxide. While trees do absorb CO2 from the atmosphere, they also do
other things, like absorb warmth and light that would have otherwise
been reflected back into space. They can also emit compounds that,
rather counterintuitively, can actually increase levels of some
greenhouse gases. Taking all this into consideration, the researchers
think the cooling effect of tree planting could be upto 30% lower than
previous estimates. The findings are important as the world looks for
ways to remove CO2 from the atmosphere to limit the worst effects of
global warming. “Planting trees has an intuitive appeal,” the authors
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=2d3a2c36d1&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>,
noting that many businesses tout their tree-planting efforts as a carbon
offsetting gesture. “Trees can help fight climate change, but relying on
them alone won’t be enough.”

<li>Coal’s slowdown is slowing down
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>The United States has been able to drive its greenhouse
gas emissions to their lowest level since the early 1990s largely by
reducing the amount of energy on the grid generated by coal to a vast
extent. But the steady retirement of coal plants may be slowing down,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=03b204dc9c&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>
<em>Heatmap</em>’s Matthew Zeitlin. Only 2.3 GW of coal generating
capacity are set to be shut down so far in 2024,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=c2c0f06b61&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to</a> the Energy Information Administration. While in 2025, that number
is expect to jump up to 10.9 GW, the combined 13.2 GW of retired
capacity pales in comparison of the more than 22 GW retired in the past
two years.

<h2 id="the-plop-boot-managers">The Plop boot managers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>I wrote different boot managers. Three boot managers are available as
download. The Plop Boot Manager 5, PlopKexec and the new boot manager
PBM6. The new boot manager is under development. ↫ Elmar Hanlhofer I had
never heard of the three Plop boot managers, written by Elmar Hanlhofer,
but they seem like quite the capable tools. First, Plop Boot Manager 5
is the most complete version, but it’s also quite outdated by now, with
its last release stemming from 2013. That being said, it’s incredibly
feature-packed, but since it lacks EUFI support, its use case seems more
focused on legacy systems. PBM6, meanwhile, is the modern version with
EUFI support, but it’s not complete and is under development, with
regular releases. Finally, PlopKexec is exactly what the name implies –
a boot manager that uses the Linux kernel. I’ve never encountered these
before, but they seem quite interesting, and if it wasn’t for how much I
do not like messing with bootloaders, I’d love to give these a go. Have
any of you ever used it?</p>

From the BBC World Service: As Ukraine prepares to mark two years since

economy is holding up — but funding from the U.S. and other
international backers remains essential. In Ukraine, however, delays in
international funding are weighing on confidence. Plus, could menopause

<a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev">herman.bearblog.dev</a>
</p>
<p>
Herman is the creator of the super minimal blog platform
<a href="https://bearblog.dev">bearblog.dev</a>—it was included in my
recent <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/blog-platforms">list of blog
platforms</a>—and he’s based in Cape Town like my long time friend
<a href="https://robhope.com">Rob</a> and they actually know each-other,
something I didn’t know when I first contacted Herman to be part of the
series. I love how small the web world can feel at times.

<p>
<strong>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce
yourself?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I’m Herman, a maker and game developer living in Cape Town, South
Africa. I grew up and went to school in a small town outside of
Johannesburg, then went to university at the University of Pretoria
where I studied Computer Science with a focus on Multimedia. This led me
down the path to become a game developer, and later a maker of neat
things for the Internet.
</p>
<p>
My primary hobbies currently are writing on
<a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/">my blog</a> (and maintaining the
platform Bear Blog), building games for the
<a href="https://Play.date">Play.date</a>, and riding motorcycles (I
live in a very beautiful part of the world and this is, in my opinion,
the best way to see the landscape).
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What's the story behind your blog?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I’ve always been a writer. In high school I started writing short
stories, all of which have been lost to the ether, thankfully. As a
young adult I started writing the kinds of things that young people full
of new knowledge and self discovery generally do. I started keeping a
journal around this time, about which I’ve written a
<a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/why-i-journal/">few</a>
<a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/years-of-journaling/">times</a>
before.
</p>
<p>
Later on, as my experience in my field grew and I felt like I had more
to share with the world, I started blogging on a semi-regular basis.
During this time my blog went through many different iterations. I was
on Wordpress, Proseful, wrote in plain HTML for a bit, then finally
built my own platform as a way of
<a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/how-to-procrastinate/">procrastinating</a>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to
blogging?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I generally write about what has been on my mind lately. My partner,
Emma, listens to me blab on at length about things like
<a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/the-humble-roundabout/">traffic
circles</a>,
<a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/the-frustration-loop/">building
frustration</a> into products, and the like. This is only for a few
days, generally, but sometimes spans months. Then, after I’ve thoroughly
interrogated the concept it finds its way to a rough outline in my notes
app where I start sifting through the thoughts in a more structured way.
This is usually turned into the first draft the next day (I like to let
the outline marinate overnight), edited, and published.
</p>
<p>
I also keep a Trello board of writing ideas for when I’m feeling
particularly uncreative.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe
the physical space influences your creativity?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I am highly affected by physical spaces and sound. For a decent period
of my life while I was travelling I worked out of noisy coffee shops.
I’m surprised I got any work done. Now when I’m travelling I shell out
the extra cash for a quiet co-working space where I can think without
being interrupted by the loud Australian tourists three tables over
loudly talking about how wasted they got last night.
</p>
<p>
At home we have a “day room” which has big windows overlooking Table
Mountain. This provides a lot of natural light and is my favourite place
to work. There is, however, a primary school across the road, and when
the kids come out for recess, chaos breaks loose as they fight for
school-yard dominance. For those two half hour periods, I have a set of
noise cancelling headphones.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your
tech stack?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I use <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear Blog</a> as my blogging
platform of choice. Not only do I use it, but I am also the creator of
it. I was very unimpressed with the options available with their
infinite customizability and bloat. All I needed was a quick and easy
way to get my words up on the internet. I also wanted people to be able
to read them without all the cruft that surrounds modern content. So I
built Bear, and it’s now loved by tens of thousands of writers
worldwide.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would
you do anything differently?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
This is an interesting question, since I’ve been considering starting
another blog that is more specific to no-nonsense information about
climate and environment-related technology (think geoengineering, green
energy generation, and the like). And the conclusion I came to is that
I’d build it in the exact same way I have with my own blog: Running on
Bear, writing in a semi-casual and personal tone on technical topics,
injecting my own personality where possible.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how
much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it
generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising
personal blogs?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Because I run the platform, my blog is, naturally, cost free. My blog is
not meant to generate revenue and I do not intend for it to do so.
However, because I regularly write about the development of the Bear
Blog platform, and the trials and tribulations of building out the small
web, sometimes people look at it and, maybe, start a blog. If I’m
particularly lucky, they even upgrade. So while my blog is not monetised
in the traditional sense, there is a small financial reward for posts
that do exceedingly well.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth
checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing
next?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I follow a handful of small- to medium-sized blogs, but the one I’m
always the most excited to see in my RSS reader is
<a href="https://coryzue.com/">coryzue.com</a>
</p>
<p>
This is a blog by a maker in my city who writes about similar themes to
me, but also muses existentially at times. His blog is a great read, and
he would also make a good candidate for an interview.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with
us?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Right now I’m just fascinated with the
<a href="https://play.date">play.date</a> and will be building games for
the next few months. You can see a list of running projects on my blog’s
<a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/projects/">project page</a>.

id="ibm-begins-work-on-power11-enablement-for-upcoming-linux-6.9">IBM
begins work on Power11 enablement for upcoming Linux 6.9</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>The first “Power11” patches were queued today into the PowerPC’s
“next” Git branch ahead of the upcoming Linux 6.9 kernel cycle. The
first of many IBM Power11 processor/platform enablement patches are
beginning to flow out for the Linux kernel for enabling the
next-generation Power processors. This shouldn’t be too surprising given
that a few months ago IBM began posting “PowerPC Future” patches for the
GCC compiler with speculating at the time it was for Power11 just as IBM
previously called their “future” CPU target in GCC for Power10 prior to
those processors officially debuting. ↫ Michael Larabel I really hope
IBM learned from the POWER10 fiasco and will make sure POWER11 is
properly and fully open again, because POWER9’s openness made it unique
among the other options out there. Without it, there’s really no reason
for an enthusiast community to developer around POWER11 as it did around
POWER9, and that would be a shame. Again.</p>

Plans ‘Crushing’ Sanctions on Kremlin 2 Years After Ukraine War</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina — Two years after Russia’s war on Ukraine,
the United States is doubling down pressure on the Kremlin by rolling
out sanctions on Russia targeting banks and the weapons industry, as
described by a senior U.S. official.</p>
<p>A day before the U.S. plan to announce new sanctions packages imposed
on Moscow, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there’s a strong
desire among the Group of 20 for Russia’s aggression in Ukraine to
end.</p>
<p>“If you were in that room, as (Russian) Foreign Minister Lavrov was,
you heard a very strong chorus coming from not just the G7 countries
within the G20, but from many others as well, about the imperative of
ending the Russian aggression, restoring peace,” Blinken told reporters
during a press conference after attending G20 foreign ministers’
meetings in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</p>
<p>Some of the U.S. sanctions will target those responsible for the
detention death of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny.</p>
<p>“The fact that (Russian President) Vladimir Putin saw it necessary to
persecute, poison, and imprison one man speaks volumes not about
Russia’s strength under Putin, but its weakness,” Blinken added.</p>
<p>In Washington, Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland said during a
Thursday event hosted by the Center for Security and International
Studies, or CSIS, that the U.S. will impose “a crushing new package of
sanctions, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them, in the next
couple of days.”</p>
<p>Some of these sanctions will be targeted at individuals directly
involved in Navalny’s death, but the vast majority are designed to
further impact “Putin’s war machine” and close gaps in existing
sanctions, according to Nuland.</p>
<p>Despite the efforts of the United States and other countries to
isolate Moscow, it remains actively engaged in diplomatic activities, as
demonstrated by the presence of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov
at this week’s G20 ministerial meeting.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Lavrov held talks with Turkish Foreign Minister
Hakan Fidan, where they discussed “diplomatic solutions” to the Ukraine
war.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have said they don’t see the conditions for diplomatic
negotiations to end the Ukraine war, as there’s skepticism that Russia
is not motivated to negotiate and that Putin would never accept an
independent Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Two years. We are all here,” wrote Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy in a post on the social media platform X, formerly known as
Twitter, indicating that representatives from dozens of countries and
various international organizations have gathered to show solidarity
with Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Alabama Supreme Court on February 16, 2024, decided that cells
awaiting implantation for in vitro fertilization are children and that
the accidental destruction of such an embryo falls under the state’s
Wrongful Death of a Minor Act. In an opinion concurring with the ruling,
Chief Justice Tom Parker declared that the people of Alabama have
adopted the “theologically based view of the sanctity of life” and said
that “human life cannot be wrongfully destroyed without incurring the
wrath of a holy God.”</p>

id="why-are-americans-likely-stuck-with-a-biden-trump-rematch-in-november">Why
Are Americans Likely Stuck With a Biden-Trump Rematch in November?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — In an election year beset with uncertainties, one thing
is clear: Americans find a November rematch between U.S. President Joe
Biden and his leading Republican challenger, former U.S. President
Donald Trump, even less appealing than the first time around in
2020.</p>
<p>A January Reuters/Ipsos poll showed most Americans do not want Biden
and Trump to run again and that they are tired of seeing the same
candidates in presidential elections.</p>
<p>Trump is besieged by legal woes, and both he and Biden are seen as
too old, although polls show more Americans worry about Biden, who would
be 81 on Election Day, than Trump, who would be 78.</p>
<p>So, why are Americans in this predicament?</p>
<p>The short answer, according to analysts, is that both Biden and Trump
want another term, and they operate in a political system geared to
favor incumbents.</p>
<p>Trump wants four more years</p>
<p>A second term could deliver vindication for Trump who since losing to
Biden in 2020 has pushed baseless claims that the election was stolen,
said Thomas Schwartz, a presidential historian with Vanderbilt
University.</p>
<p>Trump’s critics accuse him of running not for the good of the country
but to stay out of prison, something he denies. Trump faces 91 criminal
charges under four indictments: for falsifying his business records in
New York, for withholding classified federal government documents in
Florida, and for attempting to overturn the 2020 election in two
separate cases in Washington and the state of Georgia.</p>
<p>These indictments have not hurt his poll numbers, said Clifford
Young, president of Ipsos Public Affairs in the U.S.</p>
<p>“Trump has a very strong connection with his base,” Young told VOA.
“It’s almost unbreakable.”</p>
<p>Revisiting grievances that resonate with MAGA (Make America Great
Again) Republicans, Trump dominated the primaries — the statewide voting
processes in which voters select a party’s nominee who will compete in
the general election — held so far. He is expected to handily win the
rest, capitalizing on a system that amplifies the most ideologically
fervent voices of the electorate.</p>
<p>This is particularly true in states with “closed” primaries where
voters must register with a party before voting. The process shuts out
independent and unaffiliated voters, and candidates win by taking on the
most ideologically extreme positions.</p>
<p>“You have an overwhelming vote for Donald Trump among Republican
primary voters,” Schwartz told VOA.</p>
<p>But even “open” primaries, where registered voters regardless of
their political affiliation can vote for any candidate, reflect only a
small share of the electorate. In U.S. elections since 2000, the average
turnout rate for primary elections is 27% of registered voters, compared
to 60.5% for general elections.</p>
<p>Biden wants four more years</p>
<p>Like any incumbent American president, Biden sees a second term as a
vindication of his achievements, Schwartz said.</p>
<p>Biden secured a series of legislative wins, led the Western response
to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and presided over an economy where
recession fears have eased, growth and job gains are beating
expectations, and inflation is cooling.</p>
<p>“It is possible for Joe Biden to declare himself a successful
one-term president and step aside. He just doesn’t want to,” Schwartz
noted, citing Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson who decided not to run
again in March of 1952 and 1968 respectively. “And the party is not
strong enough to tell him to do so.”</p>
<p>Democrats see Biden as the best barricade against their biggest fear
— another Trump administration, Schwartz said. Had Trump not been in the
race, he added, they would have been more willing to challenge
Biden.</p>
<p>“What I’m hearing is, we’re riding with Biden,” said Democratic
strategist Corryn Grace Freeman.</p>
<p>This despite progressives’ frustration with the president’s inability
to fully cancel student loan debt and his response to the Israel-Hamas
war, she told VOA.</p>
<p>“There are many people that cannot support this president, who also
don’t like Donald Trump, who just feel like the Democratic Party
consistently fails us,” she said, adding that support from Blacks and
Latinos “is beginning to dwindle because of how this president has shown
up.”</p>
<p>Democrats are now stuck in an extraordinarily high-risk gamble where
a potential health or other age-related incident could further
discourage voters, Schwartz warned. But despite Biden’s weak poll
numbers and questions about his age, there is no Plan B for
Democrats.</p>
<p>“No viable alternative got into the race,” said Elaine Kamarck,
senior fellow in Governance Studies and the director of the Center for
Effective Public Management at Brookings Institution. “You can’t beat
something with nothing,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>This notion was put to the test early, during the January New
Hampshire primary that Biden skipped because he had promised South
Carolina Democrats that their state would host the first primary. The
president was not on the New Hampshire primary ballot, but the majority
of voters there wrote in his name, delivering his overwhelming victory
over two longshot challengers, Minnesota Congressman Dean Phillips and
self-help author Marianne Williamson, who were on the ballot.</p>
<p>System favors incumbents</p>
<p>Both essentially running as incumbents, Biden and Trump have huge
influence over their party apparatus and resources. They also benefit
from a primary system where a small number of states have outsized
influence and candidate choices are locked in far in advance of the
election, even if they become less popular.</p>
<p>The latter feature of the system is the unintended result of efforts
to fix the former, said Geoffrey Cowan, a professor at the University of
Southern California.</p>
<p>During the 1968 Democratic National Convention, Cowan pushed for
reform to ensure voters in all 50 states are represented, replacing a
system where fewer than 20 states held primary elections and caucuses
and presidential nominees were mostly selected by party leaders during
their convention.</p>
<p>“I put together this commission which said that all delegates to the
1972 convention would have to be picked through a process open to full
public participation in the calendar year of the election,” Cowan told
VOA.</p>
<p>In mandating that primaries are held the same year, the commission
did not anticipate that state rules would evolve to lock in candidates
early, even if voters’ attitudes about them change, Cowan said.</p>
<p>Most states now require candidates who want to run in a party’s
primary to register by the first week of election year. States also race
to hold their primaries as early as possible, a process known as
frontloading.</p>
<p>This means by the third week of February, it would be difficult for a
candidate to launch a campaign against Biden or Trump even though there
are still more than 250 days to the election. Primaries have been held
in critical states such as New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina,
and candidacy filing deadlines have passed in many others.</p>
<p>Which means, unless one of them drops out and the party scrambles to
nominate a replacement during the convention, Americans are stuck with
either Trump, who will be the Republican nominee by championing MAGA
grievances, or Biden, because he is seen as the only one who can beat
Trump.</p>

have the motto for the Biden campaign: <i>Old enough to know better.</i>
Uncle Joe, sit down with a reporter you can relate to, and explain what
aging is about. How there’s good and bad that come with getting on, and
Repubs (of course) have been focusing on the bad but the journalists
aren’t getting the other side. One thing is for sure, it’s hard to put
one over on someone who’s been in politics at the highest level for as
long as President Joe has been. That’s what the “know better” part is
about. Whatever you can say about him, he knows a lot about being
president. I’ve been using this motto as my own tagline for a while. But
in the interest of protecting our democracy, I think the president
should use it for his re-election campaign. No charge. <span

id="unrwa-chief-says-israeli-pressure-funding-freeze-threaten-agency">UNRWA
Chief Says Israeli Pressure, Funding Freeze Threaten Agency</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>United Nations —  The head of the embattled U.N. agency that assists
Palestinian refugees warned Thursday that it is at a “breaking point,”
and its ability to assist millions of Palestinians is “seriously
threatened.”</p>
<p>“It is with profound regret that I must now inform you that the
Agency has reached breaking point, with Israel’s repeated calls to
dismantle UNRWA and the freezing of funding by donors at a time of
unprecedented humanitarian needs in Gaza,” Commissioner General Philippe
Lazzarini wrote in a letter to the president of the U.N. General
Assembly.</p>
<p>Without new funding, he said UNRWA’s operations across the region
will be severely compromised starting in March.</p>
<p>The General Assembly established the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for
Palestine Refugees, UNRWA, in 1949 to assist some 700,000 Palestinian
refugees displaced in the aftermath of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war that
broke out after Israel became a state in May that year.</p>
<p>Today, it operates not just in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, but also
in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, where there are large Palestinian refugee
communities. Nearly 6 million Palestinians are eligible for UNRWA
services, which include education and health care.</p>
<p>UNRWA has faced severe financial problems before, but after Israel
presented information to Lazzarini last month alleging that 12 UNRWA
staffers were involved in the October 7 terror attacks inside Israel,
the agency faced its biggest crisis yet.</p>
<p>The staffers were immediately fired, and an internal investigation
was launched. But in the aftermath, 16 donors, including top contributor
the United States, suspended funding totaling around $450 million.</p>
<p>A second, independent review of UNRWA’s working methods and
neutrality was ordered by the United Nations. Former French Foreign
Minister Catherine Colonna is heading it up and will present her group’s
final report in April. She met with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio
Guterres on Thursday to discuss their work.</p>
<p>“We will specifically clarify the mechanisms, the process in place,
the structures and see if they ensure the neutrality as they should to
the best of the power within UNRWA, and we also will look at how they
have been implemented, of course, in practice, not only they’re fit for
purpose, but how they are implemented,” she told reporters.</p>
<p>Tensions</p>
<p>Israeli officials have criticized UNRWA for years, alleging that
Hamas uses its schools for terrorist activities and that they promote an
anti-Israel curriculum. After the October 7 allegations, the rhetoric
intensified.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a visiting group of U.N.
ambassadors in Jerusalem on January 31, that UNRWA was “totally
infiltrated with Hamas” and its “mission has to end.” </p>
<p>Last week, Foreign Minister Israel Katz said in a post on social
media platform X that, “UNRWA cannot be a part of Gaza’s landscape in
the aftermath of Hamas.”</p>
<p>At the United Nations, Israel’s ambassador asserted on Tuesday,
without offering any details or evidence, that 12% of UNRWA’s 13,000
staff members in Gaza are members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic
Jihad, and that at least 236 of them “are active terrorists in these
organizations’ armed wings.”</p>
<p>“In Gaza, Hamas is the U.N. and the U.N. is Hamas,” Ambassador Gilad
Erdan told a Security Council meeting, saying Hamas had a data center
and tunnels under UNRWA headquarters in Gaza.</p>
<p>UNRWA’s Lazzarini said in his letter that his agency does not have
“counterintelligence, police, or criminal justice capacities” and relies
on Israel for this, even providing the government with its staff
list.</p>
<p>He said Israel’s calls for UNRWA’s closure are not about the agency’s
neutrality but are political.</p>
<p>“Instead, they are about changing the long-standing political
parameters for peace in the occupied Palestinian territory set by the
General Assembly and the Security Council,” he said. “They seek to
eliminate UNRWA’s role in protecting the rights of Palestine Refugees
and acting as a witness to their continuing plight.”</p>
<p>Palestinians want to preserve their “right of return” as a final
status issue for negotiations with Israel over a two-state solution. If
the refugee agency is eliminated, some fear it could have political
implications.</p>
<p>Lazzarini appeared to link some of Israel’s campaign against UNRWA
with the International Court of Justice’s decision on January 26 to
issue provisional measures ordering Israel to take steps to prevent acts
of genocide in Gaza.</p>
<p>“Since the ICJ ruling, there has been a concerted effort by some
Israeli officials to deceptively conflate UNRWA with Hamas, to disrupt
UNRWA’s operations, and to call for the dismantling of the Agency,” he
said.</p>
<p>The commissioner general said that included Jerusalem’s deputy mayor
taking steps to evict the agency from the headquarters it has occupied
for 75 years in East Jerusalem and the tabling of a bill in the Israeli
Knesset to exclude UNRWA from U.N. privileges and immunities. He said
visas for international staff have been limited to only one to two
months, and an Israeli bank blocked an UNRWA account.</p>
<p>U.N. chief Guterres has said UNRWA is critical and irreplaceable.</p>
<p>“There is no other organization that has a presence in Gaza that is
capable of being able to respond to the needs,” he told reporters
earlier this month.</p>
<p>Most aid going into Gaza is delivered by UNRWA.</p>
<p>Ambassador Vanessa Frazier of Malta was one of the diplomats who

id="army-doctor-black-hawk-pilot-holds-record-for-longest-us-spaceflight">Army
Doctor, Black Hawk Pilot Holds Record for Longest US Spaceflight</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>pentagon — U.S. Army Colonel Frank Rubio, who holds the record for
the longest U.S. spaceflight, recounted the “awesome” experience of
re-entering Earth’s atmosphere on Thursday during a Pentagon ceremony
honoring his achievement.</p>
<p>“Colonel Rubio is a stellar example of someone who has made the
absolute most of every opportunity,” Army Secretary Christine Wormuth
said as she presented him with an honor known as the Army Astronaut
Device. “It’s truly a privilege to have him representing the Army and
the United States.”</p>
<p>The Army awards the astronaut device to soldiers who complete at
least one mission in space. Rubio joins Colonel Anne McClain and Colonel
Andrew Morgan as the only active-duty soldiers authorized to wear
it.</p>
<p>Rubio returned to Earth late last year on a Russian spacecraft after
371 days in the International Space Station.</p>
<p>The doctor and Black Hawk helicopter pilot flew more than 600 hours
in dangerous combat deployments in Bosnia, Afghanistan and Iraq before
joining NASA in 2017 to become an astronaut.</p>
<p>While becoming an astronaut is a childhood dream for many who go to
space, Rubio said he fell in love with the space mission much later in
life.</p>
<p>“It’s few things where you can say, ‘Hey, my job helps represent
humanity.’ And that’s a pretty powerful thing to be a part of,” Rubio
told reporters at the Pentagon.</p>
<p>While he now holds the record for longest spaceflight by an American,
he certainly wasn’t trying to earn that title. Rubio’s six-month mission
was extended to 371 days after his initial ride home sprang a leak.</p>
<p>His year in space led to incredible highlights, he said, from
hurtling into space on top of 300 tons of rocket fuel during the launch,
to spacewalks, to re-entering Earth’s atmosphere.</p>
<p>“You essentially become a meteorite, right, and you have a plasma
layer a couple of inches below you, because of the heat that’s
generated. All those things were awesome,” he said in response to a
question from VOA.</p>
<p>Rubio is the son of Salvadoran immigrants, and he credits the Army
for giving him the chance to reach for the stars.</p>
<p>“I think it is the American Dream. It really represents the fact that
we have so many opportunities, and again, I really value the fact that
it’s the opportunity that’s given, not the results,” he said. “And I
think if you put in the hard work, if you dedicate yourself and you
sacrifice, really almost anything is possible.”</p>
<p>Rubio told reporters on Thursday that he hopes to continue
contributing to NASA’s mission on the ground and back in space.</p>

<h2 id="charged-in-us-court-with-transporting-iranian-made-weapons">4
Charged in US Court With Transporting Iranian-Made Weapons</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>richmond, virginia — Four foreign nationals were charged Thursday
with transporting suspected Iranian-made weapons on a vessel intercepted
by U.S. naval forces in the Arabian Sea last month. Two Navy SEALs died
during the mission. </p>
<p>The criminal complaint unsealed Thursday in U.S. District Court in
Richmond alleges that the four defendants — who were all carrying
Pakistani identification cards — were transporting suspected
Iranian-made missile components for the type of weapons used by Houthi
rebel forces in recent attacks. </p>
<p>“The flow of missiles and other advanced weaponry from Iran to Houthi
rebel forces in Yemen threatens the people and interests of America and
our partners in the region,” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in
a news release. </p>
<p>U.S. officials said that Navy Special Warfare Operator 1st Class
Christopher J. Chambers was boarding the boat on January 11 and slipped
into the gap created by high waves between the vessel and the SEALs’
combatant craft. As Chambers fell, Navy Special Warfare Operator 2nd
Class Nathan Gage Ingram jumped in to try to save him, according to U.S.
officials familiar with what happened. </p>
<p>“Two Navy SEALs tragically lost their lives in the operation that
thwarted the defendants charged today from allegedly smuggling
Iranian-made weapons that the Houthis could have used to target American
forces and threaten freedom of navigation and a vital artery for
commerce,” Monaco said. </p>
<p>Muhammad Pahlawan is charged with attempting to smuggle advanced
missile components, including a warhead he is accused of knowing would
be used by the Houthi rebels against commercial and naval vessels in the
Red Sea and surrounding waters. He is also charged with providing false
information to U.S. Coast Guard officers during the boarding of the
vessel. </p>
<p>Pahlawan’s co-defendants — Mohammad Mazhar, Ghufran Ullah and Izhar
Muhammad — were also charged with providing false information. </p>
<p>Pahlawan’s attorney, Assistant Supervisory Federal Public Defender
Amy Austin, said Pahlawan had an initial appearance in U.S. District
Court on Thursday and is scheduled to be back in court Tuesday for a
detention hearing. She declined to comment on the case. </p>
<p>“Right now, he’s just charged with two crimes and we’re just at the
very beginning stages, and so all we know is what’s in the complaint,”
Austin said when reached by phone Thursday. </p>
<p>According to prosecutors, Navy forces boarded a small, unflagged
vessel, described as a dhow, and encountered 14 people on the ship on
the night of January 11, in the Arabian Sea off the Somali coast. </p>
<p>Navy forces searched the dhow and found what prosecutors say were
Iranian-made weapons, including components for medium-range ballistic
missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles. </p>
<p>All 14 sailors on the dhow were brought onto the USS Lewis B. Puller
after Navy forces determined the dhow was not seaworthy. They were then
brought back to Virginia, where criminal charges were filed against four
and material witness warrants were filed against the other 10. </p>
<p>According to an FBI affidavit, Navy forces were entitled to board the
ship because they were conducting an authorized “flag verification” to
determine the country where the dhow was registered. </p>
<p>The dhow was determined to be flying without a flag and was therefore
deemed a “vessel without nationality” that was subject to U.S. law, the
affidavit states. </p>
<p>According to the affidavit, the sailors on the dhow admitted they had
departed from Iran, although at least one of the men initially insisted
they departed from Pakistan. </p>
<p>The affidavit states that crew members had been in contact multiple
times by satellite phone with a member of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps.</p>

<h2 id="why-2024-is-a-make-or-break-year-for-rivian">Why 2024 Is a Make
or Break Year for Rivian</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-23, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTUzOTgwOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNTIwNTU2M30.n6UgkznFZa2qvpezjOiPvPFoRG1aMlYottzpzcFznqc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
America’s most interesting electric-vehicle company is about to have the
defining year of its life.<br/>
</p>
<p>
On Wednesday, the company reported that it lost $1.58 billion in the
fourth quarter of last year, bringing its net annual losses to $5.4
billion. It announced that it is laying off about 10% of its salaried
employees, but — at the same time — promised that it has a plan to
achieve a small profit by the end of this year.
</p>
<p>
Rivian does not seem to be in trouble — not quite yet, at least. But the
earnings made clear what electric-vehicle observers have known for a
long time: Either the company will emerge from this year poised to be a
winner in the EV transition, or it will find itself up against the wall.
</p>
<p>
That’s partially because Rivian has a stomach-turning number of
corporate milestones coming up. Over the next 11 months, it plans to
unveil an entirely new line of vehicles, shut down its factory for
several weeks for cost-saving upgrades, break ground on a new $5 billion
facility in Georgia, and — most importantly — turn a profit for the
first time. It also expects to manufacture and deliver roughly another
60,000 vehicles to customers.
</p>
<p>
Any one of these goals would be difficult to achieve in any environment.
But Rivian is going to have to execute all of them during a time defined
by “economic and geopolitical uncertainties” and especially high
interest rates, its CEO R.J. Scaringe told investors on Wednesday. Since
2021, Rivian’s once robust stockpile of cash
<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-earnings-153047612.html?guccounter=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has
been cut in half</a> to about $7 billion; at its current burn rate, the
company will run out of money in a little more than two years.
</p>
<p>
Although Rivian’s situation is dire, it’s not experiencing anything out
of the ordinary.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-news-tesla-cybertruck-ford-gm" target="_self">As
I’ve written before</a>, the electric truck maker is crossing what
commentators sometimes call “the EV valley of death.” This is the
challenging point in a company’s life cycle where it has developed a
product and scaled it up to production — thereby raising its operating
expenses to eye-watering levels — but where its revenue has not yet
increased too.
</p>
<p>
During this vulnerable period, a company essentially burns through its
cash on hand in the hope that more customers and serious revenue will
soon show up. If those customers don’t arrive, then it either needs to
raise more cash … or it runs out of money and goes bankrupt.
</p>
<p>
It’s a frightening time, but once a company crosses the valley of death,
it can reach an idyll. Not so long ago, Tesla found itself in something
like Rivian’s position as it prepared to launch the Model 3. Seven years
later, it is the most valuable automaker in the world.
</p>
<p>
Once Rivian’s revenue exceeds its costs, its problems will get easier,
or at least more straightforward: Instead of fighting for its survival
and watching its cash reserves dwindle, Scaringe will be able to make
more strategic trade-offs. Should the company cut costs to expand its
profit margin and reward investors, or should it pass the savings along
to customers in the form of lower prices, thus growing its market share?
Scaringe can’t make these types of decisions until his firm is safely
out of the valley.
</p>
<p>
Claire McDonough, Rivian’s chief financial officer and a former J.P.
Morgan director, has a plan for crossing that canyon — an aptly if
strangely named “bridge to profitability” that it will attempt to build
this year. Rivian’s survival, she said, will depend above all on cutting
the unit costs of producing its vehicles, including by using fewer
materials to make every car. Other savings will come from making more
vehicles faster. That’s what makes the shutdown plan, though it might
seem extreme, worth it; McDonough said those improvements alone will get
the company about 80% of the way to profitability.
</p>
<p>
Another 15% will come from marketing more “software-enabled products” to
Rivian drivers and by selling air-pollution credits to other carmakers,
whose vehicles are not as climate-friendly. This is a tried-and-true
technique; Tesla
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/27/business/tesla-earnings.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first
turned a profit in 2021</a> by selling regulatory credits needed to
comply with federal and California state-level rules to other, dirtier
automakers. But that same year, Tesla also debuted an entirely new
vehicle: the Model Y crossover, which quickly became its top seller in
the United States. Tesla, in other words, finally started to make money
by cutting costs, finding new revenue sources, <em>and </em>releasing
new products.
</p>
<p>
New products, however, are becoming a weak point for Rivian. The company
says that high interest rates will keep demand for its vehicles flat
this year. It expects to make about 60,000 of them, about 20,000 fewer
than what it had once anticipated. The Rivian R1S, a three-row S.U.V.,
has become the company’s flagship; it is selling better and is cheaper
to manufacture than Rivian’s pickup, the R1T. It also costs <em>at
least</em> $75,000, or nearly $600 a month to lease. The highest-tier
models can cost $99,000. Turns out, it’s difficult to sell a lot of
$70,000 trucks when even the cheapest new-car loans
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/money/auto-loan-interest-rates-by-credit-score" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hover
around 6%</a>.
</p>
<p>
Rivian once had a first-to-market advantage in the electric three-row
SUV market, but that may be fizzling out, too. Kia is now selling its
own all-electric three-row SUV, the EV9, for $18,000 less than the R1S;
in fact, the Kia EV9’s most expensive trim costs $76,000, which is only
slightly more than the <em>cheapest </em>R1S. The Kia SUV can also
charge faster than the Rivian under ideal conditions. It remains an open
question how many rich suburbanites are still interested in buying
Rivians, especially now that the Tesla Cybertruck and Ford F-150
Lightning are competing directly with Rivian’s pickup truck.
</p>
<p>
The company’s hopes, in other words, rest on its next product line: the
R2, which it will launch on March 7. We know almost nothing about the R2
line, except that it will probably include an SUV, that it will go on
sale in 2026, and that it will fall somewhere in the $45,000 to $55,000
price range. (The median new car transaction in the United States
<a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/kbb-atp-november-2023/#:~:text=11%2C%202023%20%E2%80%93%20The%20U.S.%20new,Book%2C%20a%20Cox%20Automotive%20company." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">now
costs $48,200</a>.) Last year, Scaringe told me that the R2’s timing was
perfect because it would fit “beautifully with what we see as this big
shift” in the American EV market. In today’s market, he said, “a lot of
people ask themselves, <em>Am I gonna get an electric car? Well maybe
the next one.” </em>He better hope they’ll start buying that next one in
2026.
</p>
<p>
Even if they do, Rivian may still have to confront the problem that
Tesla has changed the EV market before Rivian could get there. When the
first Tesla Model 3s
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/29/tesla-delivers-first-model-3-cars-now-comes-the-big-push.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were
delivered in 2017</a>, the sedan was instantly one of the best EVs on
the market — because it was one of the <em>only </em>EVs on the market.
Now every automaker in the world has plans to compete at the Model 3’s
price point.
</p>
<p>
Rivian’s fortunes don’t rest entirely on American consumers; it also
sells vans to commercial fleet operators, as well as delivery trucks to
Amazon. (Amazon owns about 17% of Rivian.) But that business can be
lumpy. Rivian’s vehicle growth slowed down last quarter, for instance,
almost entirely because of a near pause in sales to Amazon, which sets
up fewer new vehicles in the fourth quarter. If Amazon is willing to
bail out Rivian, in other words, it’s not yet clear in the data.
</p>
<p>
None of this is to say that the company’s outlook is dire. Rivian was
always going to find itself at a moment like this, when its expenses
exceeded its revenue by such a large amount. The automaker already has
devoted fans, and many people — myself included — are interested in the
R2 as a potential first EV purchase.
</p>
<p>
And the company has shown that it can make strides in a single year.
Twelve months ago, I had never seen a Rivian on the road before; today,
one is regularly parked on my block. The company rocketed from a
standing start to become the No. 5 best-selling electric car brand in
America last year. What the company has done so far is impressive. But
now it must prove that it can be great.
</p>
<p>

Rivian’s cash burn rate.</em>

id="ex-fbi-source-accused-of-lying-about-bidens-returns-to-us-custody">Ex-FBI
Source Accused of Lying About Bidens Returns to US Custody</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>las vegas — A former FBI informant who claims to have links to
Russian intelligence and is charged with lying about a
multimillion-dollar bribery scheme involving President Joe Biden’s
family was again taken into custody Thursday in Las Vegas, two days
after a judge released him, his attorneys said. </p>
<p>Alexander Smirnov was arrested during a meeting Thursday morning at
his lawyers’ offices in downtown Las Vegas. The arrest came after
prosecutors appealed the judge’s ruling allowing Smirnov, 43, who holds
dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship, to be released with a GPS monitor ahead
of trial. He is charged with making a false statement and creating a
false and fictitious record. </p>
<p>Attorneys David Chesnoff and Richard Schonfeld said in a statement
that they have requested an immediate hearing on his detention and will
again push for his release. They said Smirnov was taken into custody on
a warrant issued in California for the same charges. </p>
<p>The case against Smirnov was originally filed in California, where he
used to live. Several sealed entries were listed in the court docket,
but no additional details about his return to custody were immediately
available. </p>
<p>A spokesman for Justice Department special counsel David Weiss, who
is prosecuting Smirnov, confirmed that Smirnov had been arrested again,
but did not have additional comment. He is in the custody of U.S.
marshals in Nevada, said Gary Schofield, the chief marshal in Las
Vegas. </p>
<p>Prosecutors say Smirnov falsely told his FBI handler that executives
from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma paid President Biden and
Hunter Biden $5 million each around 2015. The claim became central to
the Republican impeachment inquiry of President Biden in Congress. </p>
<p>Smirnov has not entered a plea to the charges, but his lawyers have
said their client is presumed innocent and they look forward to
defending him at trial. </p>
<p>As part of their push to keep him in custody, prosecutors said
Smirnov told investigators after his arrest last week that “officials
associated with Russian intelligence were involved in passing a story”
about Hunter Biden. They said Smirnov’s self-reported contact with
Russian officials was recent and extensive, and said he had planned to
meet with foreign intelligence contacts during an upcoming trip
abroad. </p>
<p>U.S. Magistrate Judge Daniel Albregts on Tuesday had said he was
concerned about Smirnov’s access to money that prosecutors estimated at
$6 million but noted that federal guidelines required him to fashion
“the least restrictive conditions” ahead of trial. Smirnov was also
ordered to stay in the area and surrender his passports. </p>
<p>Prosecutors quickly appealed to U.S. District Judge Otis D. Wright in
California. </p>
<p>While his identity wasn’t publicly known before the indictment,
Smirnov’s claims have played a major part in the Republican effort in
Congress to investigate the president and his family, and helped spark
what is now a House impeachment inquiry into Biden. Republicans pursuing
investigations of the Bidens demanded the FBI release the unredacted
form documenting the unverified allegations, though they acknowledged
they couldn’t confirm if they were true. </p>
<p>Democrats called for an end to the probe after the Smirnov indictment
came down last week, while Republicans distanced the inquiry from his
claims and said they would continue to “follow the facts.”</p>

<h2 id="coals-slowdown-is-slowing-down">Coal’s Slowdown Is Slowing
Down</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-22, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTU0MDEyNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MzU4MjUzMn0.Ca9WLDl006-CsUiW2wPYtVTC7ol4G_aIAtkebCazIog/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
The United States has been able to drive its greenhouse gas emissions to
their lowest level since the early 1990s largely by reducing the amount
of energy on the grid
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/americas-carbon-emissions-fell-for-the-first-time-since-covid" target="_self">generated
by coal</a> to a vast extent. In 2005,
<a href="https://www.iea.org/countries/united-states/electricity" target="_blank">by
far the predominant source</a> of U.S. electricity, making up some 2.2
million gigawatt-hours of the country’s 4.3 million GWh total energy
consumption, according to the International Energy Agency. In 2022, by
contrast, coal generation was down to 900,000 GWh out of 4.5 million GWh
generated. As a result, “U.S. emissions are 15.8% lower than 2005
levels, while power emissions are 40% lower than 2005 levels,” according
to BloombergNEF and the Business Council for Sustainable Energy.
</p>
<p>
But the steady retirement of coal plants may be slowing down. Only 2.3
GW of coal generating capacity are set to be shut down so far in 2024,
according to the Energy Information Administration. While in 2025, that
number is expect to jump up to 10.9 GW, the combined 13.2 GW of retired
capacity pales in comparison of the more than 22 GW retired in the past
two years, according to EIA figures. Over the past decade, coal
retirements have averaged about 10 GW a year, with actual retirements
<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/02/21/coal-plants-shutdown" target="_blank">often
outpacing forecasts</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for the reasons behind the slowdown, some analysts think utilities
and electricity markets — especially ones seeing increased demand on the
East Coast — may decide to extend the life of their existing coal units
to maintain reliability.
</p>
<p>
“The return of load growth, delays in bringing renewables online and a
renewed focus on reliability have led utilities and other generation
owners to delay and in some cases reconsider their plans for retiring
coal plants altogether,”
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/ci/research-analysis/top-10-questions-facing-north-american-gas-and-power-markets-i.html?utm_source=marketo&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=q1_2024_energy_transition_global_awareness_email_sp_newsletter&utm_content=email_t4_body&mkt_tok=MzI1LUtZTC01OTkAAAGRcIqTNUqUL2SX7iOYzJ_1bDIw6NtTEMitEudfiIHHE6LbvfeRKPpoakT0d4OwK-t3X4zH5N1kDUn4ogSwgQYYKfJHrQcWxIE3H_rLHWzE9beuxWRQUQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to an S&amp;P Global Commodities Insight note</a>.
</p>
<p>
In the country’s largest electricity market, the PJM Interconnection,
there are only six coal units set to be deactivated, and only one,
Warrior Run in Maryland, set to be retired this year, with another
coal-powered plant in the state, Brandon Shores, set to be retired in
2025. But even if some coal plants
<a href="https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2523761-us-coal-demand-to-fall-despite-retirement-shift" target="_blank">stay
open longer</a> than might have been expected, they may not be a boon to
the coal extraction industry, which still has to deal with overall
decreased demand for coal.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>This week, a federal appeals court in Montana
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/coal-moratorium-appeals-court-climate-fc502f8e5e8c5e7c8a680199804de927" target="_blank">lifted
a moratorium</a> on coal leasing on federal lands. The original
moratorium was
<a href="https://eelp.law.harvard.edu/2017/09/doi-coal-leasing-moratium/" target="_blank">enacted
in 2016</a>, and even though it’s bounced
<a href="https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/doi-issues-orders-terminate-coal-leasing-moratorium-and-environmental-review-reconsider" target="_blank">back
and forth</a> between
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/08/12/court-coal-moratorium/" target="_blank">administrations</a>,
the amount of coal produced on federal lands has fallen sharply since
then. In 2014, there were around 420 million tons of coal produced on
federal and native land; by 2021 — the last full year before the
moratorium was put back into effect by a federal judge in 2022 — that
figure had fallen to 277 million.

<p>NASA’s X-59 experimental aircraft is unique – it’s designed to fly
faster than the speed of sound, but without causing a loud sonic boom.
To confirm the X-59’s ability to fly supersonic while only producing
quiet sonic “thumps,” NASA needs to be able to record these sounds from
the ground. The agency recently completed tests […]</p>

DeSantis Is Attacking the Greatest Food Innovation Since the

In the
<a href="https://www.flgov.com/2022/01/11/governor-ron-desantis-state-of-the-state-address-3/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Free
State of Florida</a>, Republicans have banned woke public investments,
woke racial education, and woke books in school libraries. Now they’re
trying to ban woke meat.
</p>
<p>
Legislation that would criminalize the sale of cultivated meat grown
from animal cells is wending its way through the state House and Senate,
even though cultivated meat is not currently for sale anywhere in
Florida — or, for that matter, anywhere else. Governor Ron DeSantis,
eager to start owning libs again after his fiasco of a presidential
campaign, has said he’s on board with banning the new technology, even
though the federal government has already signed off on meat grown in
fermenters rather than feedlots as safe.
</p>
<p>
So what’s the beef?
</p>
<p>
The cattle industry has always had outsized clout in Florida politics —
the term “cracker” originated with whip-wielding Florida cattlemen — and
some Republicans hope to curry favor with the state’s ranchers by
strangling potential competition in the cradle. But the crusade against
<a href="https://heatmap.news/culture/lab-grown-meat-vegan-kosher-halal" target="_blank">cultivated
meat</a> is mostly just the latest skirmish in the DeSantis culture war
against what he considers a progressive plot to make Americans feel
guilty about the status quo.
</p>
<p>
In his only public comments about cultivated meat — sometimes described
as “lab-grown meat,” although the ultimate goal is to grow it in
breweries — DeSantis made it clear that his main objection to the
nascent industry is that its leaders hope to limit animal agriculture’s
damage to the climate and the environment. To the governor, growing meat
outside an animal is just like taking “environment-social-governance”
considerations into account in investment decisions or teaching
“critical race theory” in the classroom, a left-wing assault on
tradition.
</p>
<p>
“They really want to go after agriculture because they blame agriculture
for global warming,” DeSantis said. “You need meat, OK? Like, we’re
gonna have fake meat? That doesn’t work. There’s a whole ideological
agenda that’s coming after a lot of our society.”
</p>
<p>
Setting aside the merits of the governor’s anti-woke crusade against
“ESG,” “CRT,” and gay-themed books in public libraries, the cultivated
meat and seafood entrepreneurs trying to harness capitalism and
technology to disrupt a trillion-dollar industry notorious for
government influence-peddling don’t see what’s left-wing about
innovation or competition. They don’t want to be part of any culture
war, and as the legislative ban has been moving through Tallahassee on
party-line votes, they’re trying to remind Republicans that they’re
supposed to be against the nanny state.
</p>
<p>
Florida Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson, for instance, a key
supporter of the ban, actually boasts on his website that he’s “stood up
to politicians who treat Floridians like children incapable of making
their own choices.”
</p>
<p>
“How does banning our products promote consumer choice?”
<a href="https://www.bluenalu.com/" target="_blank">Blue Nalu </a>CEO
Lou Cooperhouse, whose San Diego startup is cultivating bluefin tuna
toro, told me. “It’s un-American and un-Floridian to stifle innovation
and attack free-market principles.”
</p>
<p>
It is true that cultivated meat has extraordinary potential to limit the
impacts of animal agriculture, which now uses one quarter of the land on
Earth and is by far the leading driver of deforestation and biodiversity
loss. But even if you don’t care about the climate or the environment —
or the looming public health crisis created by the overuse of
antibiotics in livestock, or the tens of billions of animals who get
slaughtered every year — there’s a compelling business proposition
behind cultivated meat: Animal meat is inefficient. Why waste feed,
land, water, energy and other resources helping livestock stay warm,
poop, burp methane, have babies and do other things that don’t produce
meat?
</p>
<p>
That’s why a part-time futurist named Winston Churchill, not usually
considered a wokester, predicted in a 1931 essay titled “50 Years Hence”
that “we shall escape the absurdity of growing a whole chicken in order
to eat the breast or wing.” But it’s now 93 years hence, and while more
than 150 startups around the world have begun growing chicken cutlets,
burgers, pork meatballs, salmon nigiri and even woolly mammoth meat from
cells, they’re not yet doing it inexpensively enough to compete with
conventional meat and seafood.
</p>
<p>
Last year, the Bay Area startups
<a href="https://upsidefoods.com/" target="_blank">Upside Foods</a> and
<a href="https://www.goodmeat.co/" target="_blank">Good Meat</a> served
America’s first cultivated chicken to restaurant patrons in San
Francisco and Washington, but only for a limited time to a very limited
number of diners. (Some journalists have tried it, too, and I can report
that both companies make chicken that tastes like chicken.) For now, you
can’t buy cultivated meat anywhere on Earth, and while its costs have
plunged more than 99% in a decade, many skeptics doubt that it will ever
get cheap enough to make a dent in the 350 million tons of animal meat
that the world consumes every year. In the past few months,
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/upside-foods-glenview-illinois-factory-lab-grown-meat/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Wired</em></a>,
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-02-07/lab-grown-meat-has-bigger-challenges-than-the-fda" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>,
and
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/09/opinion/eat-just-upside-foods-cultivated-meat.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The
New York Times</em></a> have all published quasi-obituaries for the
industry.
</p>
<p>
Plant-based meat, hailed five years ago as the next big thing in food,
is also struggling mightily. Global sales have stopped soaring and are
actually declining, and industry darling Beyond Meat’s stock price is
down more than 95% from its peak. Meat substitutes have faced a flurry
of attacks — some from meat-industry water-carriers, some from
natural-food ideologues, and some reflecting genuine discomfort with the
idea of eating so much technology — as “ultra-processed foods” with long
ingredient lists.
</p>
<p>
But the problems meat substitutes are designed to address are
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/food-and-farms/afraid-of-high-tech-food-get-over-it" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not
going away</a>. Cattle burps (and, to a lesser extent, farts) produce
methane, while manure is a major source of nitrous oxide and water
pollution, and the world is on track to deforest another two Indias
worth of land by 2050 to satiate humanity’s meat tooth. DeSantis may
think it’s silly to blame agriculture for global warming, but overall,
it generates a fourth of global greenhouse gas emissions, most of them
from livestock. It’s not yet as big a problem as fossil fuels, but it is
a big problem. And since meat consumption is expected to rise at least
50% by 2050, the problem is getting worse.
</p>
<p>
Meat alternatives made from plants, fungi, or animal cells can use far
less land and generate far fewer emissions than meat made from
slaughtered animals, which is why supporters see them as the
agricultural equivalent of solar, wind, and other clean-energy
alternatives to fossil fuels. Cleaner meat should receive the kind of
public support that governments have long provided to cleaner energy,
they argue — which has started to happen in the European Union, China
and even the United States, which provided $10 million for a cultivated
meat research center at Tufts University early in the Biden
Administration.
</p>
<p>
Obviously, it isn’t happening in Florida. Cultivated meat lobbyists have
been passing around a clip from a Chinese newspaper gloating about the
Sunshine State’s restrictions, saying they will help ensure Chinese
domination of the new industry. Rini Greenfield, who runs an ag-tech
venture fund called Rethink Food in Miami, told me the ban would send “a
clear message to technology companies to take their operations
elsewhere.” In fact, every venture that testified against the bill was
based in California, the state DeSantis constantly cites as the epitome
of woke.
</p>
<p>
But culture wars are bad for business, no matter where you’re
headquartered. The industry doesn’t want to be making Bidenburgers any
more than the electric vehicle industry wanted to manufacture
Obamamobiles. Today, they’re not selling to anyone, but someday, they
want to sell to everyone.

id="former-us-president-jimmy-carter-surpasses-one-year-in-hospice-care">Former
US President Jimmy Carter Surpasses One Year in Hospice Care</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>chicago, illinois — A year since The Carter Center announced that
former U.S. President Jimmy Carter was receiving end-of-life hospice
care, Carter continues to defy the odds.</p>
<p>He quietly celebrated his 99th birthday on October 1, and last
appeared in public on November 29 to attend the funeral of his wife,
Rosalynn Carter.</p>
<p>“He is very old and very frail,” said author Jonathan Alter, who
chronicled Carter’s life in the book “His Very Best.” “When you are 99,
various systems in your body start breaking down, but it’s very
important to understand that he does not have any underlying health
condition like heart failure or cancer.”</p>
<p>The Carter family’s decision to announce that the 39th president was
entering hospice care has raised awareness about end-of-life care
giving, which Alter compares to the decades-long efforts of the former
president and first lady to remove the stigma associated with mental
illness.</p>
<p>“They did this very intentionally to give a boost to the hospice
movement,” Alter told VOA in a recent Skype interview. “I don’t think
there was any expectation that he’d still be in hospice a year later,
but they were very, very interested in spreading the word about
hospice.”</p>
<p>“Once again leading by example, [the Carter family] is showing us how
to embrace a stage of life that people don’t want to think about — that
people don’t want to talk about,” Ben Marcantonio, interim CEO of the
National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, explained during an
event his organization sponsored in New York’s Time Square in August,
recorded live on Facebook.</p>
<p>“They’re showing us how hospice helps patients live life to the
fullest to the end of life, and that’s why we’re gathered here today to
publicly thank President Carter and his family.”</p>
<p>While now out of the spotlight, the global nonprofit Carter Center
continues to “wage peace, fight disease and build hope” around the
world. One of Jimmy Carter’s key efforts leading the center — the
complete eradication of parasitic Guinea worm infections — marked a
steady number of infections in the last several years.</p>
<p>“Thirteen human cases reported in 2023,” said Adam Weiss, director of
The Carter Center’s Guinea worm eradication program. “With such few
human cases, the biggest risk is about the reinfection of humans from
some of the animal infections that are occurring primarily in Chad,
Mali, Cameroon and Angola.”</p>
<p>“While nine of those 13 cases were in Chad, four of those nine cases
were in one family,” explained Dr. Donald Hopkins, one of the architects
of The Carter Center’s Guinea worm eradication efforts.</p>
<p>Hopkins encouraged Carter to take on the neglected tropical disease
in the center’s early days and added that while the annual number of
infections did not decrease this year, the total number of infections
globally are dramatically different from where they were when the effort
began in the 1980s.</p>
<p>“There were an estimated 3 ½ million cases, mostly in Africa, but
some also in India, Pakistan and Yemen,” said Hopkins. “Having only 13
human cases now annually means that a lot fewer people are
suffering.”</p>
<p>Middle East conflicts</p>
<p>In recent months, The Carter Center has called for a cease-fire in
the war between Israel and Hamas, which threatens to undo a pillar of
Jimmy Carter’s legacy. The genesis of the center’s efforts to promote
peace and democracy around the world was the success of the Camp David
Peace Accords, which Carter brokered between Egypt and Israel during his
presidency in the 1970s.</p>
<p>“This treaty between Egypt and Israel is the most successful, durable
treaty of the postwar era,” Alter told VOA.</p>
<p>The tense and difficult negotiations Carter hosted at the Camp David
Presidential Retreat for 12 days in September 1978 between Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin resulted
in a treaty that ended decades of conflict between Israel and one of its
most powerful neighbors.</p>
<p>“Israel turned back hundreds of thousands of acres of land in the
Sinai Peninsula and pulled the Israeli settlements in the Sinai
Peninsula as they turned that land back to Egypt. In exchange for that,
they received a promise from Egypt it would not attack Israel as it had
four times in the previous 30 years. It was understandable why it would
be durable. It was a land for peace swap,” Alter said.</p>
<p>But as Israel presses its offensive against Hamas in the Gaza strip,
the Egyptian government has threatened to suspend the 45-year-old
treaty.</p>
<p>“Given the stakes, this is a big deal and obviously very much on the
mind not only of the Israelis who understand its importance, but also
the United States,” Alter said.</p>
<p>He said it also underscores Carter’s unrealized dream of broader
peace in the Middle East.</p>
<p>“If Jimmy Carter were just a few years younger, you can bet he would
be in the region right now trying to make peace,” Alter said.</p>
<p>While Carter holds the records for the longest-living occupant of the
White House and the longest marriage of any president and first lady in
U.S. history, he marks another first this year.</p>
<p>The White House Historical Association unveiled its annual Christmas
ornament on Wednesday, this year featuring Carter — the first time a
living president is honored with an ornament.</p>
<p>“Both the front and reverse side of the ornament feature peace doves,
symbolic of President Carter’s work for peace in the Middle East, and
perhaps most significantly, the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty signed on the
North Lawn of the White House on March 26, 1979,” the association
describes on its website.</p>
<p>On the reverse side of the ornament is the Seawolf-class USS Jimmy
Carter. Commissioned in 2005, it is the only submarine to be named for a
living president. The globe at the center refers to Carter’s lifelong
work on environmental conservation. At the base of the anchor is a
garland of peanut flowers, a reminder of Carter’s years as a farmer and
businessman in Plains, Georgia.</p>

<p>date: 2024-02-22, from: FreeDOS News</p>
<div class="markdown_content">
<p>
Bernd has released an update to FreeDOS FDISK, the program that creates
and manages partitions on fixed disks. Version 1.3.14 provides these
fixes: + Fix a drive letter disagree between DOS and FDISK in cases
involving multiple disks and a mix of active and non-active primary
partitions. + Prevent querying LBA capabilities via INT13,41, if LBA
access is disabled by the user. This caused some broken BIOS to crash
the system, like BIOS version 0.9.4 of Book8088 and Xi8088. The new
version has these changes: - Do not check for extra cylinders by
default. DR-DOS refuses to use partitions exceeding the BIOS reported
disk size, despite being valid. - Update German translation. You can
find the new version at

<h2 id="duolingo">Duolingo</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-22, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
Duolingo does a great job capturing the novel delight of learning a new
language. You hop on, take a short quiz, and a little green owl waves at
you and hops towards a trophy. You can add friends, join group
challenges, and there’s a weekly ranking system to compete with users
all over the world where you have a chance to move up a league, stay
stagnant, or potentially get demoted to a lower league.
</p>
<p>
Duolingo takes a
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced
repetition</a>” approach at language learning. I like how the app serves
you vocabulary in isolation as well as in different sentence contexts
with different AI voices, all aimed to reinforce the words before it
leaves your brain. The progress meters, streaks, and competitive nature
of the app are all a part of the gamification system designed to keep
you coming back. But… there’s a lot of them.
</p>
<p>
Here’s a short list of all the progress meters inside the Duolingo
you’re responsible for filling up.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Daily streak progress
</li>
<li>
Course progress
</li>
<li>
Lesson progress
</li>
<li>
Daily missions for monthly reward
</li>
<li>
Monthy achievement progress
</li>
<li>
Weekly league ranking progress
</li>
<li>
Weekly friend challenge progress
</li>
<li>
Collecting gems
</li>
<li>
Match Madness progress
</li>
<li>
+9 other achievement categories
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Slowly you realize the truth about Duolingo; it’s not a language
learning platform, it’s an engagement platform. And through that
engagement you might pick up some language skills. Duolingo does little
in explaining how rudimentary concepts like verbs or participles work
and instead lets you piece it together solely from repetition and
context clues. Repetition in learning is important but without ever
addressing the fundamentals of a language Duolingo reveals it’s
prioritizing something else over language mechanics.
</p>
<p>
Duolingo succeeds when you log in, see an ad after every lesson, and
feel like you’re making progress towards a goal so that you will log in
the next day and repeat the cycle. The dopamine hits and then a surprise
(!) Double XP potion shows up at the beginning of the week. The Double
XP boosts your score and you secure a spot on the leaderboard. This
spurs more notifications and sessions for your competitors, which serves
more ads. Now the pressure’s on to avoid losing your spot on the
leaderboard. Another potion shows up to get you over the mid-week slump
and to stir the coals of the engagement metrics again. You can of course
pay to not see ads and unlock faster dopamine hits.
</p>
<p>
And then there’s the social pressure from the cartoon bird to keep your
streak alive. At first it’s motivating and cute but then turns a bit
ominous and manipulative, saved only by its sense of humor.
</p>

<p>
Despite it all the engagement theatrics, Duolingo is fun. I wish I had
Duolingo when I was initially learning Japanese in college (or Spanish
in high school). I think along with textbook learning it would have
cemented a lot of concepts for me. It’s fun to get a daily dose of
something new and see the scores go up.
</p>
<p>
At one point all four members of my family were on Duolingo learning
four different languages simultaneously in the same room. That was
chaotic, fun, and made me genuinely excited to see my family enjoy
learning another language which something I enjoy. When you’d hear a the
notable ding from across the house, you’d feel a Pavlovian urge to open
the app on your phone and continue learning. One-by-one in reverse age
order, however, we all came to the same conclusion that the repetition
and the notifications were tiresome. After using Duolingo for 100 days
in a row, I uninstalled the app.
</p>
<p>
I’ve enjoyed noodling on Japanese, Piano, Spanish, German, Korean,
Esperanto, and Klingon… and perhaps I will again one day, but for now
it’s become another to-do during the day. The lessons were too
repetitive and slow for me, a person who wants to flex a part of my
existing memory and not learn from scratch. I can only hear about green
tea so many times. Your experience might be different, but if I could
find a “Practice Only” version of Duolingo without the engagement
machine attached and a little less repetition, I think that would be the
right fit for me.

IVF Provider in Alabama Pauses Some Services After Ruling on
Embryos</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>montgomery, alabama — A second in vitro fertilization provider in the
U.S. state of Alabama is pausing parts of its care to patients after the
state Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos are legally considered
children. </p>
<p>Alabama Fertility Services said in a statement Thursday that it has
“made the impossibly difficult decision to hold new IVF treatments due
to the legal risk to our clinic and our embryologists.” </p>
<p>The decision comes a day after the University of Alabama at
Birmingham health system said in a statement that it was pausing IVF
treatments so it could evaluate whether its patients or doctors could
face criminal charges or punitive damages. </p>
<p>“We are contacting patients that will be affected today to find
solutions for them and we are working as hard as we can to alert our
legislators as to the far reaching negative impact of this ruling on the
women of Alabama,” Alabama Fertility said. “AFS will not close. We will
continue to fight for our patients and the families of Alabama.” </p>
<p>Doctors and patients have been grappling with shock and fear this
week as they try to determine what they can and can’t do after the
ruling by the all-Republican Alabama Supreme Court that raises questions
about the future of IVF. </p>
<p>Alabama Fertility Services’ decision left Gabby Goidel, who was days
from an expected egg retrieval, calling clinics across the South looking
for a place to continue IVF care. </p>
<p>“I freaked out. I started crying,” Goidel said. “I felt in an extreme
limbo state,”</p>
<p>The Alabama ruling came down Friday, the same day Goidel began a
10-day series of injections ahead of egg retrieval, with the hopes of
getting pregnant through IVF next month. She found a place in Texas that
will continue her care and plans to travel there Thursday night. </p>
<p>Goidel experienced three miscarriages and she and her husband turned
to IVF as a way of fulfilling their dream of becoming parents. </p>
<p>“It’s not pro-family in any way,” Goidel said of the Alabama
ruling. </p>
<p>Dr. Michael C. Allemand, a reproductive endocrinologist at Alabama
Fertility, said Wednesday that IVF is often the best treatment for
patients who desperately want a child, and the ruling threatens doctors’
ability to provide that care. </p>
<p>“The moments that our patients are wanting to have by growing their
families — Christmas mornings with grandparents, kindergarten, going in
the first day of school, with little backpacks — all that stuff is what
this is about. Those are the real moments that this ruling could deprive
patients of,” he said. </p>
<p>Justices — citing language in the Alabama Constitution that the state
recognizes the “rights of the unborn child” — said three couples could
sue for wrongful death when their frozen embryos were destroyed in an
accident at a storage facility. </p>
<p>“Unborn children are ‘children’ … without exception based on
developmental stage, physical location, or any other ancillary
characteristics,” Justice Jay Mitchell wrote in Friday’s majority
ruling. Mitchell said the court had previously ruled that a fetus killed
when a woman is pregnant is covered under Alabama’s Wrongful Death of a
Minor Act and nothing excludes “extrauterine children from the Act’s
coverage.” </p>
<p>While the court case centered on whether embryos were covered under
the wrongful death of a minor statute, some said treating the embryo as
a child — rather than property — could have broader implications and
call into question many of the practices of IVF.</p>

<h2 id="intel-will-make-chips-for-microsoft">Intel will make chips for
Microsoft</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>US chip company Intel will make high-end semiconductors for
Microsoft, the companies announced, as it seeks to compete with TSMC and
Samsung to supply the next generation of silicon used in artificial
intelligence for customers around the world. Chief executive Pat
Gelsinger said at a company event on Wednesday that Intel is set to
“rebuild Western manufacturing at scale,” buoyed by geopolitical
concerns in Washington about the need to bring leading-edge
manufacturing back to the US. ↫ Michael Acton Having our entire advanced
chip industry built atop one Dutch company and one company on an island
China would love to invade is not exactly the recipe for a stable supply
chain. I think it’s a great idea to build capacity in the US and Europe,
and if Intel’s the one to do it – with lavish government funding, I
might add – then so be it. We’d all love for it to be more diverse than
that, but the sad reality is that building advanced chip factories is
really hard and really expensive, and very few companies have both the
knowledge and money to do so.</p>

<p>Android introduced support for Seamless Updates quite a long time ago

supported update mechanism, but that may not be enough to stop Samsung.
↫ Ben Schoon at 9To5Google The fact Samsung hasn’t embraced Seamless
Updates yet is utterly baffling. It’s better in every single way, and
there’s little to no downsides one can think of. I hope this little
nudge gets them to finally get their act together.</p>

Apart from getting started in the midst of one of Silicon Valley’s
regular downturns, another great thing about the beginnings of Nvidia
was that instead of insisting on the “minimum viable product” our VCs,
Sutter Hill and Sequoia, gave us the time to develop a real architecture
for a family of chips. It enabled us to get an amazing amount of
functionality into a half-micron gate array;
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/12/hardware-io-virtualization.html">I/O
virtualization</a>, a DMA engine, a graphics processor that rendered
curved surfaces directly, not by approximating them with triangles, a
sound engine and support for game controllers. As I write, after a three
decade-long history of bringing innovations to the market, Nvidia is
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c43661bb-a087-4a54-a4b4-a6549d9156c3">America’s
third most valuable company</a>. <br /> <br /> I’ve written
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/search/label/venture%20capital">several
times</a> about how in pursuit of a quicker buck, VCs have largely
discarded the slow process of building an IPO-ready company like Nvidia
in favor of building one that will be acquired by one of the dominant
monopolists. These VCs don’t support innovation. Even if their
acquisition-bound companies do innovate in their short lives, their
innovations are rarely tested in the market after the acuisition.<br />
<br /> Below the fold I discuss a new paper that presents a highly
detailed look at the mechanisms the dominant companies use to neutralize
the threats startups could pose to their dominance.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> In
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845"><i>Coopting
Disruption</i></a> law professors Mark Lemley (Stanford) and Matthew
Wansley (Cardozo) ask a good question:<br />
<blockquote>
Our economy is dominated by five aging tech giants—Alphabet, Amazon,
Apple, Meta, and Microsoft. Each of these firms was founded more than
twenty years ago: Apple and Microsoft in the 1970s, Google and Amazon in
the 1990s, and Facebook in 2004. Each of them grew by successfully
commercializing a disruptive technology—personal computers (Apple),
operating systems (Microsoft), online shopping (Amazon), search engines
(Google), and social networks (Facebook). Each of them displaced the
incumbents that came before them. But in the last twenty years, no
company has commercialized a new technology in a way that threatens the
tech giants. Why?
</blockquote>
The TL;DR of Lemley and Wansley’s answer to their question
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">is</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
While there are many reasons for the tech giants’ continued dominance,
we think an important and overlooked one is that they have learned how
to coopt disruption. They identify potentially disruptive technologies,
use their money to influence the startups developing them, strategically
dole out access to the resources the startups need to grow, and seek
regulation that will make it harder for the startups to compete. When a
threat emerges, they buy it off. And after they acquire a startup, they
redirect its people and assets to their own innovation needs.

a company that is started with the goal of being swallowed by a tech

<h3>
Introduction
</h3>
They start by identifying the advantages and disadvantages the
incumbents possess in their efforts to monetize innovations. Their list
of advantages is:<br />
<ul>
<li>
“large incumbents can take advantage of economies of scale” not just in
manufacturing, but also in marketing an distribution by exploiting their
existing customer relationships.
</li>
<li>
“Large incumbents can also take advantage of economies of scope.
Innovation creates “involuntary spillovers”—new knowledge that has
economic value beyond the specific product that the firm was
developing.”
</li>
<li>
“large incumbents can access capital at a lower cost” for example from
retained earnings from their cash cows.
</li>
<li>
“large incumbents may have another potential advantage—a longer
investment time horizon” even more so now with the compression of VC
time horizons.
</li>
</ul>
Their list of incumbents disadvantages in innovation is more
interesting:<br />
<ol>
<li>
“their success will cannibalize their own market share” or “More
generally, a monopolist has diminished incentives to introduce new
products, improve product quality, or lower prices because any new sales
generated replace its existing sales.” Economists call this “Arrow’s
replacement effect”; more specifically: “The general lesson is, all else
equal, the larger a firm’s market share and the less it is threatened by
competition, the weaker its incentives to innovate. So we should expect
large incumbents to not innovate much. And if they can dispense with the
competitors rather than have to compete with them, they will do that.”
</li>
<li>
“their managers prefer to deliver incremental innovations to their
existing customers”. Unlike Arrow’s theory, “Christensen’s theory of
disruptive innovation, … focuses on the career incentives of middle
managers … Incumbent managers have an incentive to deliver sustaining
innovations—incremental improvements in quality to the firm’s existing
products that will please its existing customers. But they have
substantial disincentives to pursue projects that upset the apple cart,
even if doing so would bring new customers to the firm” The fundamental
problem is that “Housing an innovation project inside a firm with
diverse lines of business creates conflict with those other businesses.
Some firm assets—cash, cloud computing, equipment, facilities, and
engineers’ time—are rivalrous and finite, so executives must be willing
to fight internal constituencies to devote those resources to
innovation.” Ingenuity, NASA’s wildly successful Mars helicopter is a
good example, as Eric Berger reports in
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/02/before-ingenuity-ever-landed-on-mars-scientists-almost-managed-to-kill-it/"><i>Before
Ingenuity ever landed on Mars, scientists almost managed to kill
it</i></a>. It was competing for cost, weight and risk with
Perseverance’s primary mission.
</li>
<li>
“their single veto point decision-making structure encourages
risk-aversion” More specifically: “Inside a large incumbent, decisions
about whether to fund an innovative project must pass through one veto
point. In the venture capital market, many competing investors
independently decide whether to finance an innovative idea. Inside a
firm, an employee with an innovative idea must pitch an idea to managers
who ultimately report to one executive gate-keeper. In the venture
capital market, if a would-be startup founder pitches an idea to ten VC
firms, and nine of them are not persuaded, the idea gets funded.” The
advantage of market-based finance over internal finance applies not just
to the initiation but also the continuation of an innovation project.
Inside a firm, an executive who has soured on a project can terminate
it. In the venture capital market, when a startup’s initial investors
grow skeptical, the company can still pitch outsiders on infusing more
cash.” The authors make this important point (my emphasis): “And while
economists often describe markets as efficient, there is no reason to
believe individual corporate executives make efficient (or even
rational) decisions. Just ask Twitter. Markets work not because private
executives make good decisions but because the ones who make bad
decisions get driven out. But <b>that dynamic only works with
competition</b>.”
</li>
<li>
“they cannot appropriately compensate employees working on innovation
projects.” The reason they cannot is that: “Startups solve this problem
by giving employees stock options. Every employee with significant
equity knows that if the startup successfully exits, they will be
rewarded. Stock in a large, diversified public company does not create
similar incentives. The incentives are diluted because the value of the
stock will be affected by too many variables unrelated to the success of
the specific innovation project.” And that: “large firms do not
recognize internal “property rights” to innovations that employees
develop. If they did, employees might become reluctant to share
information. But not protecting internal property rights gives
innovative employees incentive to leave. If employees at a large firm
found their own startup and raise venture capital to fund it, they will
earn a much greater share of the profits of the innovation.”
</li>
</ol>
The authors go on to describe five techniques incumbents use to
neutralize the threat of disruption that innovative startups might pose;
network effects, self-preferencing, paying for defaults, cloning, and
coopting the disruptor. They claim other have described the first four,
but they don’t amount to an adequate explanation for why the tech giants
haven’t been disrupted. I will summarize each of the four in turn..
<h3>
Network effects
</h3>
Nearly three decades ago W. Brian Arthur, in
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Increasing-Returns-Dependence-Economics-Cognition/dp/0472064967"><i>Increasing
Returns and Path Dependence in the Economy</i></a> explained how
increasing returns to scale, or network effects, of technology markets
typically led to them being dominated by one player. Consider a new
market opened up by a technologcal development. Several startups enter,
for random reasons one gets bigger then the others, network effects
amplify its advantage in a feedback loop.<br /> <br /> This effect is
more important now, as the the giants’ business models have evolved to
become
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">platforms</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The tech giants’ core businesses are built on platforms. A platform is
an intermediary in a two-sided market. It connects users on one side of
the market with users on the other side for transactions or
interactions.<br /> …<br /> Platforms tend to exhibit network
effects—the addition of a new user increases the value of a platform to
existing users and attracts new users.
</blockquote>
This is precisely the mechanism Brian Arthur described, but applied to a
business model that has since been enabled by the Internet.<br />
<h3>
Self-preferencing
</h3>
Self-preferencing happens when a platform isn’t just a two-sided market,
but one in which the platform itself is
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">a vendor</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Amazon, for example, both invites third party vendors to sell their
products in its online marketplace and sells its own house brands that
compete with those vendors. Amazon has a powerful advantage in that
competition. It has access to data on all of its competitors—who their
customers are, which products are selling well, and which prices work
best. And it controls which ads consumers see when they search for a
specific product. Assuming Amazon uses that information to prefer its
own products to those of its competitors (either by pricing
strategically or by promoting its own products in search results) –
something alleged but not yet proven in a pending antitrust case – the
result is to bias competition. Vendors cannot realistically protest
Amazon’s self-preferencing (or just go elsewhere) because Amazon has
such a dominant share in the online retail market.
</blockquote>
<h3>
Paying for defaults
</h3>
The value of the default position is notorious
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">because</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Alphabet pays Apple a reported $18 billion (with a b) each year for
Google to be the default search engine on iOS devices. Android and iOS
together account for 99% of the U.S. mobile operating system market.
Consequently, almost everyone who uses a smartphone in America is
accustomed to Google search. Alphabet claims that “competition is just a
click away.” But research and experience have shown that defaults can be
somewhat sticky. So controlling the default position can give Alphabet
(or whoever wins the Apple bid) an advantage. That said, someone has to
be the default, and it might be better for consumers if the default is
the search engine most users already prefer. The real problem might be
the idea of paying for placement, whoever wins the bidding war.
</blockquote>
<h3>
Cloning
</h3>
There are many examples of a tech giant tryng to neutralize the threat
from a startup by using the threat of cloning their product to force the
startup to sell itself, or of actually cloning the product and using
their market power to swamp the startup. Meta’s addition of Reels to
Instagram in response to Tik Tok is an obvious example. But the authors
make two good points:
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">First</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Cloning is only objectionable if the tech giant wins out not by
competition on the merits, but by exclusionary conduct.
</blockquote>
Second, that cloning
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">often fails</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Google+, Google’s effort to build a social media service that combined
the best of Facebook and Twitter was an abject failure. Apple’s effort
to control the music world’s move to streaming by offering its own
alternative to Spotify hasn’t prevented Spotify from dominating music
streaming and eclipsing the once-vibrant (and Apple-dominated) market
for music downloads. Meta’s effort to copy Snap, then TikTok, by
introducing Stories and Reels has not proven terribly successful, and
certainly has not prevented those companies from building their markets.
</blockquote>
The fact that the giants can clone a startup’s product leads the authors
to <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">ask</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
If the product is cloneable, then why would you buy the company and burn
cash paying off its VCs?
</blockquote>
There are two possible answers. It may be faster and easier, though
likely not cheaper, to “acquihire” the startup’s talent than to recruit
equivalent talent in the open market. Or it may be faster and easier,
though likely not cheaper, to acquire the company and its product rather
than cloning it.
<h3>
Inadequate Explanation
</h3>
The authors use the example of
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">Microsoft</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Microsoft enjoyed strong network effects in the 1990s as the dominant
maker of operating system software – far more dominant than it is today.
It cloned internet browser technology from upstarts like Netscape, and
it engaged in anticompetitive conduct designed to ensure that it, not
Netscape, became the browser of choice.82 But Microsoft’s victory over
Netscape was short-lived. New startups – Mozilla and then Google – came
out of nowhere and took the market away from it. Microsoft still
benefits from network effects, and it still uses cloning and
self-preferencing to send users to its Edge browser. But it doesn’t
work. Microsoft employed all the tools of a dominant firm in a network
market, but it still faced disruption.
</blockquote>
So these four techniques aren’t an explanation for the recent dearth of
disruption.<br />
<h3>
Coopting disruption
</h3>
The authors imagine themselves as a tech giant, asking what else they
would do to prevent disruption, and coming up with
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">four new
techniques</a>:<br />
<ul>
<li>
“First, you would learn as much as you can about which companies had the
capability to develop disruptive innovations and try to steer them away
from competing with you – perhaps by partnering with them, or perhaps by
investing in them.”
</li>
<li>
“Second, you would make sure that those companies could not access the
critical resources they would need to transform their innovation into a
disruptive product.”
</li>
<li>
“Third, you would tell your government relations team to seek regulation
that would build a competitive moat around your position and keep
disruption out.”
</li>
<li>
“Fourth, if one of the companies you were tracking nevertheless did
start to develop a disruptive product, you would want extract that
innovation—and choke off the potential competition—in an acquisition.”
</li>
</ul>
These are the techniques they call “coopting disruption”, pointing out
that the <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">tech giants
have</a>:<br />
<ul>
<li>
“built a powerful reconnaissance network covering emerging competitive
threats by investing in startups as corporate VCs and by cultivating
relationships with financial VCs.”
</li>
<li>
“accumulated massive quantities of data that are essential for many
software and AI innovations, and they dole out access to this data and
to their networks selectively.”
</li>
<li>
“asked legislators to regulate the tech industry—in a way that will
buttress incumbents.”
</li>
<li>
“repeatedly bought potentially competitive startups in a way that has
flown—until a few years ago—below the antitrust radar.”
</li>
</ul>
The authors detail many examples of each of these techniques, for
example Facebook conditioning access to user data on the purchase of
advertising, and Google’s purchase of DoubleClick and YouTube.
Interestingly, they contrast the recent purchasing of the tech giants
with Cisco’s famously successful purchases in the 90s:
<blockquote>
The Cisco story exemplifies how the venture capital market, as a market,
is better at exploring a series of risky ideas than a firm with a single
risk-averse gatekeeper. It also illustrates how the advantages of a
large incumbent—in this case access to markets and existing customer
relationships—can sometimes extract more market value out of a
technology than a new entrant.
</blockquote>
The rapid evoluution of networking technology at the time meant that
even Cisco, the largest company in the market, didn’t have the R&amp;D
resources to explore all the opportunities. They depended upon VCs to
fund the initial explorations, rewarding them by paying over the odds
for the successes. Their market power then got the successes deployed
much faster than a startup could.<br />
<h3>
Why Is Cooption Bad?
</h3>
The authors explain the
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">harms of
cooption</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Our claim here is that the same dynamics that inhibit disruptive
innovation by longstanding employees of large incumbents inhibit
disruptive innovation by new employees from acquired startups.<br />
…<br /> The tech giants win from coopting disruption even though it
destroys social value. In fact, they benefit in two ways. They make
faster incremental progress on the sustaining innovations that they
want. They get the new code, the valuable intellectual property, and the
fresh ideas of the startup. And, critically, they also kill off a
competitor. They no longer have to worry about the startup actually
developing the more disruptive innovation and leapfrogging them or other
tech giants acquiring the startup and using its assets to compete with
them.
</blockquote>
And, by making the innovators from the startup rich, the acquirer
greatly reduces their incentives for future innovation.
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/02/the-stanford-digital-library-project.html">Andy
Bechtolsheim</a> is an outlier.<br />
<h3>
Remedies?
</h3>
Lemley and Wansley, who seem to think in fours, make a set of four
proposals for how these harms might be reduced:<br />
<ul>
<li>
<b>Unlocking Directorates</b> — under the Clayton Act “interlocking
officers and directors between companies that compete, even in part, are
illegal <i>per se</i> – without any inquiry into whether the companies
in fact restrained competition because of their overlapping interests or
whether the conduct offered procompetitive benefits.” Companies with
less than $4.1M in revenue are exampt, which excludes most startups;
this should be revised.
</li>
<li>
<b>Limiting Leveraging of Data and Networks</b> — “we would impose on
incumbent tech monopolists a presumptive duty of nondiscrimination in
access where the defendant (1) provides or sells data or network access
to at least some unaffiliated companies and (2) refuses to provide or
sell the same data or network access to the plaintiff company on
comparable terms, but (3) the plaintiff does not operate a competing
network or otherwise compete with the defendant in the market from which
it collected the relevant data.”
</li>
<li>
<b>Regulating Regulation</b> — “Done right, regulation of technology can
be beneficial and even necessary to the development of that technology,
minimizing the risk of harm to third parties and ensuring that the world
views the technology as safe and trustworthy. But all too often
regulation has become a way to insulate incumbents from competition,
with predictable results.” The authors’ suggestions exemplify this
difficulty, being rather vague and aspirational.
</li>
<li>
<b>Blocking Cooptive Acquisitions</b> — this is the most complex of the
four proposals, and builds on
<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/45467503"><i>Nascent
Competitors</i></a> by C. Scott Hemphill &amp; Tim Wu, who write:<br />
<blockquote>
We favor an enforcement policy that prohibits anticompetitive conduct
that is reasonably capable of contributing significantly to the
maintenance of the incumbent s market power. That approach implies
enforcement even where the competitive significance of the nascent
competitor is uncertain.
</blockquote>
Justifying blocking mergers because of a nascent threat that might never
materialize is problematic. But it is only more so than the current way
anti-trust works, by projecting likely harm to consumer welfare, which
also might never materialize (although it almost always does). Lemley
and Wansley explain
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">the dilemma</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
antitrust enforcers need a strategy for blocking cooptive acquisitions
that works within existing case law (or plausible improvements to that
law) and is surgical enough to avoid chilling investment.
</blockquote>
Some cases are
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">obvious</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
For cooptive acquisitions like Facebook/Instagram deal, we think
Hemphill and Wu’s strategy makes sense. Zuckerberg’s email arguing for
acquiring startups like Instagram because “they could be very disruptive
to us” is a smoking gun of anticompetitive intent.
</blockquote>
But Lemley and Wansley go further, arguing for blocking megers based the
startup’s ability to
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">innovate distruptive
technology</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Of course, an approach to policing startup acquisitions based on
innovation capabilities need limits. Many startups have some innovation
capabilities that could have a significant effect on competition. We can
cabin enforcement in three ways—by focusing on specific technologies and
specific firms and by looking at the cumulative effects of multiple
acquisitions.
</blockquote>
Their examples of technologies include generative AI and virtual and
augmented reality, both cases where it is already too late. The
companies they identify “Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Meta”
are all veterans of multiple acquisitions in these areas. But they argue
that committing to
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">challenge fuure
mergers</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
would create socially desirable incentives for startups. A startup
developing one of the listed technologies would gain stronger incentives
to turn its innovations into the products that its management team
believed would garner the highest value on the open market—rather than
the one most valuable to the tech giants. They would also gain stronger
incentives to build a truly independent business and go public since an
acquisition by the tech giants would be a less likely exit.
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think these would all be worthwhile steps, and I’m all in favor of
updating anti-trust law and, even better, actually enforcing the laws on
the books. But I am skeptical that the government can spot potentially
disruptive technologies before the tech giants spot and acquire them.
Especially since the government can’t be embedded in the VC industry the
way the tech giants are. Note that many of the harms Lemley and Wansley
identify happen shortly after the acquisition. Would forcing Meta to
divest Instagram at this late date restore the innovations the
acquisition killed off?<br /></p>

these regional bank-commercial real estate concerns…</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-22, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Commercial real estate is a market that’s been sagging with lots of
people still working from home. That’s been a source of consternation
for regional banks with exposure to commercial real estate, like New
York Community Bancorp, which Moody’s recently downgraded. But is all
this anxiety actually overblown? We dig in. Plus, Japan’s stock market
climbs out of a decadeslong slump, and the first online-only grocer will
soon begin accepting SNAP benefits.

<p>date: 2024-02-22, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I don’t care if you work at a big company or are an individual
developer.
</p>
<p>
I care if you can make a contribution toward interop on the open web.
</p>
<p>
I’ve found over the years that sometimes devs at bigco’s can help
enormously (eg microsoft, netscape, automattic) but more often they are
harmful (apple, ibm, sun, google stand out as the worst). Sometimes
companies play both roles (apple).
</p>
<p>
But i also know that bigco’s because they are big, have lots of
different ideas how the world should work. And that can help.

<h2 id="twitters-big-competitive-advantage">Twitter’s big competitive
advantage</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-22, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<i>I wrote this
<a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1760681139407360255">on
Twitter</a> this morning. Re-posted here with minimal editing. The fact
that I could write it on Twitter was the point.</i>
</p>
<p>
Twitter has one advantage over all the other social webs. no character
limit.
</p>
<p>
I started typing a post on Threads which has a large character limit
compared to the others, but ran out of space and decided to write it
over here in twitter instead.
</p>
<p>
yes they charge me $8 a month for it, but it’s worth it.
</p>
<p>
we have to get used to the idea of paying for value, it’s how we avoid
the messes of the last 20 years. esp if we can make sure we retain
copies of everything we write (guaranteed by using our own writing
tools, btw) which is another requirement for the new blogosphere.
</p>
<p>
btw, i’m having a blast these days. it’s like tinkerbell in peter pan.
all the open web needed was people to believe it exists for it to come
(back) into existence.
</p>
<p>
still diggin.
</p>
<p>
ps: i also like they have simple styling, but where are the freaking
links, twitter. do I have to pay another $8 to get those??
</p>
<p>
pps: the worst character limit is bluesky, i can’t write anything there.
too bad, it’s a really nice system otherwise.
</p>
<p>
ppps: it would be nice to give something like this a title so you don’t
have to read pgf after pgf to try to figure out where i’m going and if
you’re interested. so i gave it a title, using markdown syntax. maybe
they could just support markdown. hmmm.
</p>
<p>
pppps: i asked chatgpt to draw an illustration. that light in the middle
of the room is the open social web. it’s a vision of self-reliance,
empowerment and cooperation. I asked for the light to be
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell">tinkerbell</a>, but
i guess they were concerned the image might belong to someone. creeping
shitification.

id="british-judges-to-rule-on-us-extradition-of-wikileaks-julian-assange">British
Judges to Rule on US Extradition of WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>London — British judges are set to rule whether Julian Assange, the
founder of the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks, will be extradited to
the United States after he launched a last-ditch legal bid this week to
block the order, the latest chapter in a legal battle stretching back
nearly 14 years.</p>
<p>U.S. prosecutors are seeking Assange’s extradition in relation to 18
federal charges relating to allegations of hacking and theft of
classified material, after Wikileaks published a trove of stolen U.S.
diplomatic cables and military documents in 2010 relating to the wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Reserved judgement</p>
<p>The two-day hearing at the High Court in London concluded Wednesday
and the two senior judges hearing the case are expected to deliver a
ruling in the coming days or weeks. “We will reserve our decision,”
judge Victoria Sharp said. It is unclear when she and fellow judge
Jeremy Johnson will issue their decision.</p>
<p>Julian Assange’s supporters staged demonstrations outside the London
court and in cities across the world, with protestors marching on U.S.
embassies to demand Assange’s release.</p>
<p>Assange was not present at the High Court due to his poor health, and
he did not appear via video link.</p>
<p>Assange’s defense</p>
<p>His defense lawyers argued the extradition warrant was politically
motivated and that Assange was simply doing his job as a journalist by
publishing the stolen U.S. files, according to Simon Crowther, a legal
adviser for the human rights group Amnesty International, which is
campaigning for the extradition order to be blocked.</p>
<p>“Firstly, they pointed out this is something that journalists do all
the time: you receive classified material as journalists from
confidential sources and you publish it when it’s in the public
interest, particularly when it covers issues such as war crimes, crimes
against humanity, accusations of torture, extrajudicial execution,”
Crowther said.</p>
<p>“So, Julian Assange’s lawyers were able to point to legal arguments
and found legal precedent that showed that this is political action that
journalists take. And as a result, they say it’s outside of the
extradition treaty between the U.S. and the U.K.,” he added.</p>
<p>Crowther said the second argument the lawyers made is that Assange’s
actions were protected under guarantees of freedom of expression.</p>
<p>Press freedom</p>
<p>Press freedom campaigners have called for the United States to drop
the charges against Assange and for him to be released from the
high-security Belmarsh prison in London. Rebecca Vincent, the director
of campaigns at Reporters Without Borders, said Assange would not get a
fair trial in the United States.</p>
<p>“The publication by WikiLeaks in 2010 of the leaked classified
documents exposed information that was in the public interest and
informed journalism around the world. The prosecutor and other US
officials have stated that as a foreign national, Assange will not be
afforded First Amendment protections. Combined with the fact that the
Espionage Act has no public interest defense, that means he cannot get a
fair trial,” Vincent told VOA in a statement.</p>
<p>US prosecutors</p>
<p>U.S. prosecutors insist that Assange would receive a fair trial. In
past hearings, British judges have also ruled that Assange would receive
fair treatment under the U.S. judicial system.</p>
<p>Clair Dobbin, one of the lawyers representing the U.S. government,
argued that Assange had encouraged people to steal documents, and that
the published material contained unredacted names of U.S. sources,
putting their lives at risk. She told the court this week that Assange
had published them “indiscriminately” without redactions, and alleged
that his actions were “unprecedented” and did not constitute
journalism.</p>
<p>Assange could not therefore be “treated as akin to an ordinary
journalist or Wikileaks akin to an ordinary publisher,” she said.</p>
<p>WikiLeaks cables</p>
<p>In 2010, WikiLeaks published a trove of diplomatic cables relating to
the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that had been stolen by the U.S. Army
intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. Assange said Manning’s leaks
exposed abuses by the United States military, including potential war
crimes.</p>
<p>Assange was first arrested in Britain in 2010 on unrelated
allegations of rape and sexual assault in Sweden. He jumped bail and
sought refuge inside the Ecuadorian Embassy, where he stayed for seven
years.</p>
<p>Sweden later dropped the charges. However, Assange was evicted from
the Ecuadorian embassy in 2019 and imprisoned for breaching bail.</p>
<p>The British government signed an extradition order to the United
States in June 2022, after successive failed legal challenges by
Assange.</p>
<p>‘Life in danger’</p>
<p>Assange’s wife Stella has repeatedly claimed that the 52-year-old’s
life is in danger if he is extradited to the U.S. “It’s an attack on all
journalists, all over the world. It’s an attack on the truth and an
attack on the public’s right to know. Julian is a political prisoner,
and his life is at risk,” she told reporters outside the High Court as
the hearing began this week.</p>
<p>In previous legal challenges, Assange’s lawyers unsuccessfully sought
to block the extradition on claims that the U.S. prison system would
constitute a risk to his life, potentially causing him to commit
suicide.</p>
<p>“If he was extradited to the U.S., Julian Assange could be held in
solitary confinement – prolonged solitary confinement. And that
constitutes a violation of the (convention on the) prohibition of
torture,” Amnesty’s Simon Crowther told VOA.</p>
<p>U.S. authorities have disputed the notion that Assange would
inevitably be held in solitary confinement.</p>
<p>Prison term</p>
<p>If he is found guilty in the U.S., Assange’s lawyers say he could
face a prison sentence of up to 175 years, but a term of 30 to 40 years
was more likely. U.S. prosecutors have said he would serve no more than
63 months.</p>
<p>The Australian parliament last week called for Assange, who holds
Australian citizenship, to be allowed to return to his homeland in a
motion supported by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.</p>
<p>If Assange wins his case at the British High Court, a full appeal
hearing will be held. If his legal bid fails, the case could be taken to
the European Court of Human Rights. However, Britain could seek to
extradite Assange to the United States before European judges could rule
on the case.</p>

“the most significant environmental dispute at the high court this
year,” and things aren’t looking good for the Environmental Protection
Agency. Several states and energy companies want to block the EPA’s
“good neighbor” plan, which seeks to impose strict emissions limits on
industrial activities in 23 states in an effort to prevent pollution
from drifting across state lines and forming dangerous smog. Challengers
say the regulation is overreaching and want its implementation delayed.
Yesterday the court’s conservative majority appeared skeptical of the
EPA’s authority, citing the fact that lower court decisions have paused
the regulation in 12 states.<br/><br/>Environmental groups worry a
ruling against the EPA here could set a dangerous precedent. “The
Supreme Court — if it were to block this rule — would effectively be
saying to industry, ‘Look, any time you face costs from a regulation,
come on up and take a shot. We might block that rule for you,’” Sam
Sankar, senior vice president for programs at Earthjustice,

<strong></strong>China’s carbon emissions increased by 12% between 2020

<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=a3a18e26c6&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analysis</a>
from <em>Carbon Brief</em>. One reason for the emissions uptick is that
drought has reduced output from hydropower, forcing China to rely more
on coal. “China has approved 218 GW of new coal power in just two years,
enough to supply electricity to the whole of Brazil,”

are coming online. This presents a strange contradiction: Coal plants
will see less use, which could spark outcry from all the new coal plant
operators, and “potential pushback against the energy transition,”

<p>Today’s links The majority of censorship is self-censorship: …But the
majority of self-censorship is intentionally cultivated by an outside
power. The Bezzle excerpt (Part V): Keep your hands at 10 and 2. Hey
look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2009, 2014,
2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances,
current writing projects, current reading The majority of censorship is
self-censorship (permalink) I know a lot of polymaths, but Ada Palmer
takes the cake: brilliant science fiction writer, brilliant historian,
brilliant librettist, brilliant singer, and then some:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/10/monopoly-begets-monopoly/#terra-ignota
Palmer is a friend and a colleague. In 2018, she, Adrian Johns and I
collaborated on “Censorship, Information Control, &amp; Information
Revolutions from Printing Press to Internet,” a series of grad seminars
at the U Chicago History department (where Ada is a tenured prof,
specializing in the Inquisition and Renaissance forbidden knowledge):
https://ifk.uchicago.edu/research/faculty-fellow-projects/censorship-information-control-information-revolutions-from-printing-press/
The project had its origins in a party game that Ada and I used to play
at SF conventions: Ada would describe a way that the Inquisitions’
censors attacked the printing press, and I’d find an extremely parallel
maneuver from governments, the entertainment industry or other entities
from the much more recent history of internet censorship battles. With
the seminars, we took it to the next level. Each 3h long session
featured a roster of speakers from many disciplines, explaining
everything from how encryption works to how white nationalists who were
radicalized in Vietnam formed an armored-car robbery gang to finance
modems and Apple ][+s to link up neo-Nazis across the USA. We borrowed
the structure of these sessions from science fiction conventions, home
to a very specific kind of panel that doesn’t always work, but when it
does, it’s fantastic. It was a natural choice: after all, Ada and I know
each other through science fiction. Even if you’re not an sf person,
you’ve probably heard of the Hugo Awards, the most prestigious awards in
the field, voted on each year by attendees of the annual World Science
Fiction Convention (Worldcon). And even if you’re not an sf fan, you
might have heard about a scandal involving the Hugo Awards, which were
held last year in China, a first:
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/science-fiction-authors-excluded-hugo-awards-china-rcna139134
A little background: each year’s Worldcon is run by a committee of
volunteers. These volunteers put together bids to host the Worldcon, and
canvass Worldcon attendees to vote in favor of their bid. For many
years, a group of Chinese fans attempted to field a successful bid to
host a Worldcon, and, eventually, they won. At the time, there were many
concerns: about traveling to a country with a poor human rights record
and a reputation for censorship, and about the logistics of customary
Worldcon attendees getting visas. During this debate, many international
fans pointed to the poor human rights record in the USA (which has
hosted the vast majority of Worldcons since their inception), and the
absolute ghastly rigmarole the US government subjects many foreign
visitors to when they seek visas to come to the US for conventions.
Whatever side of this debate you came down on, it couldn’t be denied
that the Chinese Worldcon rang a lot of alarm-bells. Communications were
spotty, and then the con was unceremoniously rescheduled for months
after the original scheduled date, without any good explanation. Rumors
swirled of Chinese petty officials muscling their way into the con’s
administration. But the real alarm bells started clanging after the Hugo
Award ceremony. Normally, after the Hugos are given out, attendees are
given paper handouts tallying the nominations and votes, and those
numbers are also simultaneously published online. Technically, the Hugo
committee has a grace period of some weeks before this data must be
published, but at every Worldcon I’ve attended over the past 30+ years,
I left the Hugos with a data-sheet in my hand. Then, in early December,
at the very last moment, the Hugo committee released its data – and all
hell broke loose. Numerous, acclaimed works had been unilaterally
“disqualified” from the ballot. Many of these were written by writers
from the Chinese diaspora, but some works – like an episode of Neil
Gaiman’s Sandman – were seemingly unconnected to any national
considerations. Readers and writers erupted in outrage, demanding to
know what had happened. The Hugo administrators – Americans and
Canadians who’d volunteered in those roles for many years and were
widely viewed as being members in good standing of the community – were
either silent or responded with rude and insulting remarks. One thing
they didn’t do was explain themselves. The absence of facts left a void
that rumors and speculation rushed in to fill. Stories of Chinese
official censorship swirled online, and along with them, a kind of
I-told-you-so: China should never have been home to a Worldcon, the
country’s authoritarian national politics are fundamentally incompatible
with a literary festival. As the outrage mounted and the scandal
breached from the confines of science fiction fans and writers to the
wider world, more details kept emerging. A damning set of internal leaks
revealed that it was those long-serving American and Canadian volunteers
who decided to censor the ballot. They did so out of a vague sense that
the Chinese state would visit some unspecified sanction on the con if
politically unpalatable works appeared on the Hugo ballot. Incredibly,
they even compiled clumsy dossiers on nominees, disqualifying one
nominee out of a mistaken belief that he had once visited Tibet (it was
actually Nepal). There’s no evidence that the Chinese state asked these
people to do this. Likewise, it wasn’t pressure from the Chinese state
that caused them to throw out hundreds of ballots cast by Chinese fans,
whom they believed were voting for a “slate” of works (it’s not clear if
this is the case, but slate voting is permitted under Hugo rules). All
this has raised many questions about the future of the Hugo Awards, and
the status of the awards that were given in China. There’s widespread
concern that Chinese fans involved with the con may face state
retaliation due to the negative press that these shenanigans stirred up.
But there’s also a lot of questions about censorship, and the nature of
both state and private censorship, and the relationship between the two.
These are questions that Ada is extremely well-poised to answer; indeed,
they’re the subject of her book-in-progress, entitled Why We Censor:
from the Inquisition to the Internet. In a magisterial essay for
Reactor, Palmer stakes out her central thesis: “The majority of
censorship is self-censorship, but the majority of self-censorship is
intentionally cultivated by an outside power”:
https://reactormag.com/tools-for-thinking-about-censorship/ States –
even very powerful states – that wish to censor lack the resources to
accomplish totalizing censorship of the sort depicted in Nineteen
Eighty-Four. They can’t go from house to house, searching every nook and
cranny for copies of forbidden literature. The only way to kill an idea
is to stop people from expressing it in the first place. Convincing
people to censor themselves is, “dollar for dollar and man-hour for
man-hour, much cheaper and more impactful than anything else a
censorious regime can do.” Ada invokes examples modern and ancient,
including from her own area of specialty, the Inquisition and its
treatment of Gailileo. The Inquistions didn’t set out to silence
Galileo. If that had been its objective, it could have just assassinated
him. This was cheap, easy and reliable! Instead, the Inquisition
persecuted Galileo, in a very high-profile manner, making him and his
ideas far more famous. But this isn’t some early example of
Inquisitorial Streisand Effect. The point of persecuting Galileo was to
convince Descartes to self-censor, which he did. He took his manuscript
back from the publisher and cut the sections the Inquisition was likely
to find offensive. It wasn’t just Descartes: “thousands of other major
thinkers of the time wrote differently, spoke differently, chose
different projects, and passed different ideas on to the next century
because they self-censored after the Galileo trial.” This is direct
self-censorship, where people are frightened into silencing themselves.
But there’s another form of censorship, which Ada calls “middlemen
censorship.” That’s when someone other than the government censors a
work because they fear what the government would do if they didn’t.
Think of Scholastic’s cowardly decision to pull inclusive, LGBTQ books
out of its book fair selections even though no one had ordered them to
do so:
https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/06/books/scholastic-book-racism-maggie-tokuda-hall.html
This is a form of censorship outsourcing, and it “multiplies the
manpower of a censorship system by the number of individuals within its
power.” The censoring body doesn’t need to hire people to search
everyone’s houses for offensive books – it can frighten editors,
publishers, distributors, booksellers and librarians into suppressing
the books in the first place. This outsourcing blurs the line between
state and private surveillance. Think about comics. After a series of
high-profile Congressional hearings about the supposed danger of comics
to impressionable young minds, the comics industry undertook a regime of
self-censorship, through which the private Comics Code Authority would
vet comings for “dangerous” content before allowing its seal of approval
to appear on the comics’ covers. Distributors and retailers refused to
carry books without a CCA stamp, so publishers refused to publish books
unless they could get a CCA stamp. The CCA was unaccountable, capricious
– and racist. By the 60s and 70s, it became clear that comic about Black
characters were subjected to much tighter scrutiny than comics featuring
white heroes. The CCA would reject “a drop of sweat on the forehead of a
Black astronaut as ‘too graphic’ since it ‘could be mistaken for
blood.’” Every comic that got sent back by the CCA meant long, brutal
reworkings by writers and illustrators to get them past the censors. The
US government never censored heroes like Black Panther, but the chain of
events that created the CCA “middleman censors” made sure that Black
Panther appeared in far fewer comics starring Marvel’s most prominent
Black character. An analysis of censorship that tries to draw a line
between private and public censorship would say that the government
played no role in Black Panther’s banishment to obscurity – but without
Congressional action, Black Panther would never have faced censorship.
This is why attempts to cleanly divide public and private censorship
always break down. Many people will tell you that when Twitter or
Facebook blocks content they disagree with, that’s not censorship, since
censorship is government action, and these are private actors. What they
mean is that Twitter and Facebook censorship doesn’t violate the First
Amendment, but it’s perfectly possible to infringe on free speech
without violating the US Constitution. What’s more, if the government
fails to prevent monopolization of our speech forums – like social media
– and also declines to offer its own public speech forums that are bound
to respect the First Amendment, we can end up with government choices
that produce an environment in which some ideas are suppressed wherever
they might find an audience – all without violating the Constitution:

The great censorious regimes of the past – the USSR, the Inquisition –
left behind vast troves of bureaucratic records, and these records are
full of complaints about the censors’ lack of resources. They didn’t
have the manpower, the office space, the money or the power to erase the
ideas they were ordered to suppress. As Ada notes, “In the period that
Spain’s Inquisition was wildly out of Rome’s control, the Roman
Inquisition even printed manuals to guide its Inquisitors on how to
bluff their way through pretending they were on top of what Spain was
doing!” Censors have always done – and still do – their work not by
wielding power, but by projecting it. Even the most powerful state
actors are not powerful enough to truly censor, in the sense of
confiscating every work expressing an idea and punishing everyone who
creates such a work. Instead, when they rely on self-censorship, both by
individuals and by intermediaries. When censors act to block one work
and not another, or when they punish one transgressor while another is
free to speak, it’s tempting to think that they are following some
arcane ruleset that defines when enforcement is strict and when it’s
weak. But the truth is, they censor erratically because they are too
weak to censor comprehensively. Spectacular acts of censorship and
punishment are a performance, “to change the way people act and think.”
Censors “seek out actions that can cause the maximum number of people to
notice and feel their presence, with a minimum of expense and manpower.”
The censor can only succeed by convincing us to do their work for them.
That’s why drawing a line between state censorship and private
censorship is such a misleading exercise. Censorship is, and always has
been, a public-private partnership. The Bezzle excerpt (Part V)
(permalink) I’m out on tour with my new novel, The Bezzle, a cyberpunk
revenge thriller about Marty Hench, a two-fisted forensic accountant,
and a guerrilla war he wages on a prison-tech provider that treats
incarcerated people as assets to be strip-mined:

https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/22/self-censorship/#acab As part of the
promotion for the book, I’ve been serializing an excerpt: Chapter 14, in
which Marty takes on a side-quest to recover the stolen royalties of
one-time funk star Stephon Magner (AKA Steve Soul) which were stolen by
his scumbag manager and then sold on to an even scummier
sample-licensing clearinghouse. Today, I bring you part five, in which
Marty’s simple cross-referencing project is violently altered by an
encounter with the criminal gangs of the LA Sheriffs Deputy departments,
a real crime-syndicate whose reign of terror continues to this day:

And now, part five! * * * The storefront had an old break room with a
first-­aid kit, and a bathroom with a sink. I sponged myself clean in the
mirror, ate two expired Aleves and three 200 mg expired Tylenols out of
the kit. The ass was ripped most of the way out of my pants, so I moved
my wallet to my front pocket, which my massage therapist had been
nagging at me to do for years. I opened the door more carefully this
time and limped out into the parking lot. My rental—­a little red
Civic—­was the only car left in the parking lot, except for a rusted
junker with no tires that was the perennial sentry of its farthest
corner. I bipped the doors open with my fob, checked the back seat, then
slid inside. I checked my reflection in the rearview mirror and winced,
which pulled at my bruises and set blood oozing from my lip and
cheekbone again, which made me wince harder. I was already halfway to
Quasimodo and I tried to remember if there was a 7-­Eleven on the route
home where I could buy a couple of bags of frozen peas for the swelling.
I reset the mirror and backed out of my spot. The pain was increasing.
They’d have Advil at the 7-­Eleven, and I’d remembered where there was
one on the way back to my Airbnb. As I waited for a red light at Eagle
Rock and Colorado Boulevard, I watched as a homeless man labored across
the road with his shopping cart. I was still watching him when I
realized the light had been green for some time and had just toggled
yellow. I made the turn and headed up Colorado, but I was barely a
hundred yards down the road when I heard a siren blat and saw the police
lights. I checked my mirrors and saw the LASD cruiser directly behind
me, racing right up to my bumper, slowing only at the very last moment.
The cruiser’s high beams blinked insistently and the siren whooped. I
pulled over. I waited while the officer slowly got out of his car and
walked to my driver’s-­side window. I kept my hands at ten and two. The
officer tapped my window and made a roll-­down motion, so I hit the
button, moving slowly, putting my hand back. I got a light in my face,
squinting and thus reopening my cheekbone and lip. “Everything all
right, sir?” “Yes,” I said, feeling the blood ooze down my chin. “I was
beaten up,” I said, stating the obvious. “That is unfortunate,” the
officer said. “License and registration.” I got my driver’s license out
of my wallet and found the rental papers in the glove box and handed
them over. He crunched back to his cruiser and I watched him in the side
mirror. He’d left his cruiser’s headlights on and in the glare it was
hard to tell, but it looked like there was another cop in the car whom
he was conferring with. After a long delay, he came back. “Step out of
the car, please.” I did. He turned me around and had me plant my hands
on the hood, kicked my feet apart, and roughly frisked me, getting his
hand inside the rent in the seat of my pants and patting my boxer shorts
and giving my balls a hard squeeze. “Sir, do you know why I stopped
you?” “I don’t,” I said. “You proceeded unsafely through a traffic
signal. Have you been drinking, sir?” “I haven’t.” “Have you consumed
any cannabis or other drugs?” “I haven’t.” He turned me around and shone
his light in my eyes. “If I search your car, am I gonna find any drugs?”
“No, sir.” “Because I am gonna search that car and if I do find drugs
and you’ve been lying to me, this is gonna be a lot worse than it needs
to be.” I didn’t dignify that with a response. My head hurt. My face
hurt. My back hurt. This was a bullshit stop. I expected the deputy’s
partner to get out of the cruiser while my tormentor tossed the rental
car, but he stayed put. I did, too. Obviously. I wasn’t going to take
off on foot. I’m a forensic accountant, not a gang kid getting fifteen
minutes of fame on Cops. He spent long enough on the rental that I
started to worry. Who knew what some previous driver might have shoved
between the seats? But after pulling out the floor mats and tossing them
onto the grassy verge beside the car, he finally stood up. “All right,
sir. I’m going to go and get a breathalyzer test. You can refuse it and
I will then suspend your license for twenty-­ four hours. I will arrest
you for a suspected DUI and bring you in for a blood test. If you fail
that test, you will be subject to additional criminal penalties. Do you
understand me?” He had old coffee on his breath. My face hurt. “I’ll
take a test.” Back to the cruiser. It had been half an hour at least.
Once the breathalyzer was done—­fifteen minutes, if memory served—­I could
go to the 7-­Eleven for painkillers and frozen peas. I decided I’d add a
six-­pack, I was so tired. My face hurt. I knew that mouthing off to this
cop wouldn’t make things go faster, quite the opposite, but as he took
his leisurely time coming back to me, I was hard-­pressed not to. I blew.
“May I sit down?” I asked. “My face hurts.” He didn’t bother to look up
from his phone. “Stay where you are, sir.” I stood. My face hurt. Time
crawled. Finally, the breathalyzer beeped. He held it up and squinted at
it, then used his phone to light up its face. When he did, his sleeve
rode up and revealed the “998” tattoo on his forearm. Suddenly, I didn’t
care so much about the pain in my face. The cop looked at me. He was an
older guy, but quite a silver fox, in a Clooneyoid sort of way. Had the
same smile lines at the corners of his lips and eyes. But on him, they
looked mean. Dangerous. A man who would smile at you while he beat your
face in. “All right, sir,” he said. “I’m going to write you a citation
for reckless driving and you will be free to go.” He smiled. “Thank you
for your cooperation.” It sounded like “fuck you.” Back to the cruiser
again. When he was done writing, he switched off his headlights, and the
bubble light inside the car lit up his partner. Heavyset. Smiling.
Excellent teeth. He gave me the same look as he had just before kicking
me in the ribs. I gasped involuntarily and my ribs burned. His smile got
bigger. The Clooneyoid deputy returned with my ticket. I looked at it
and then I realized he’d said “reckless driving”—­not “dangerous
driving.” This was a summons, not a citation. For a misdemeanor. Two
points off my license and I’d have to go to court. Depending on the
judge, I could be in for fines or even a jail sentence. Clooneyoid saw
me figuring this out and he smiled, too. Everyone was having a great
time tonight except for poor old Marty Hench. “See you in court, sir,”
he said. I exercised extreme care on the drive to the 7-­Eleven, even
backing out of my parking spot and reparking so that I was perfectly
centered between the white lines. The clerk didn’t bat an eye at my
hamburger face. I gave myself five minutes to bury my bruises in the
frozen peas before I backed out and drove the rest of the way to my
Airbnb. I drove five under the limit the whole way, and when I got out
of my rental, I looked long and hard up and down the street for an LA
Sheriff’s Department cruiser. Hey look at this (permalink) Will GPT

hits record high thanks to chips</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-22, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
<em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Tokyo’s main stock exchange closed
at a record high on Thursday, beating a three-decade old record and
largely due to semiconductor microchips. The surge comes after
U.S.-based chipmaker Nvidia posted Q4 financial results that beat
estimates. An Nvidia-based bounce drove tech stocks in Europe too. Also

Italy work?

to Send More Pandas to US, Jump-Starting New Era of ‘Panda
Diplomacy’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIJING — China’s Wildlife Conservation Association is working with
the National Zoo in Washington in an arrangement that could bring more
pandas back to the United States, signaling improving diplomatic
relations between the two superpowers.</p>
<p>China has lent its beloved bears to zoos in various countries over
the years as goodwill animal ambassadors and also fostered a modern
Sino-U.S. “panda diplomacy” with the gesture.</p>
<p>“Relevant Chinese institutions have signed agreements with the Madrid
Zoo in Spain and the San Diego Zoo in the United States on a new round
of international cooperation in the protection of giant pandas,” said
Mao Ning on Thursday, spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry,
when addressing a query at a regular press briefing.</p>
<p>“They are also working with the Washington National Zoo in the United
States and [Viennna Zoo] in Austria to actively negotiate and launch a
new round of cooperation.”</p>
<p>Earlier, the Wildlife Conservation Association said on its WeChat
social media account that it had reached and signed agreements for the
conservation of giant pandas with several zoos.</p>
<p>Back in November, the National Zoo in Washington returned three
pandas to China as part of a more than 50-year-old legacy, leaving
Georgia’s Zoo Atlanta as the only one in the U.S. with a giant panda
program.</p>
<p>That loan agreement for the zoo’s four pandas expires this year,
which meant there would be no pandas in the U.S. for the first time
since 1972 when the Chinese government presented two giant pandas as
gifts to the United States after President Richard Nixon’s historic Cold
War visit to China.</p>
<p>“We look forward to a new round of international giant panda
protection cooperation with relevant countries, which will further
expand scientific research results on the protection of giant pandas and
other endangered species, and promote people-to-people bonds and
people-to-people friendship,” Mao said.</p>
<p>Over the past year, China and the United States have had fraught
relations over a number of global issues from regional wars, trade
disputes and ongoing spying allegations. Leaders from both countries
have had several round of talks over the past few months to ease
tensions.</p>

<h2 id="russia-takes-center-stage-in-us-political-battle-1">Russia Takes
Center Stage in US Political Battle</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Russia has taken center stage in American political
discourse after the death of a prominent opposition figure there,
putting congressional Republicans under increased pressure to support
Ukraine.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden has highlighted in his recent statements one
of the differences between him and his challenger, former U.S. President
Donald Trump.</p>
<p>At a recent rally, Trump said that if he were president and a NATO
member fell short of its financial commitments to the security bloc, he
would not protect that ally. “In fact, I would encourage them” — meaning
Russia — “to do whatever the hell they want,” Trump said.</p>
<p>“Every president since Truman has been a rock-solid supporter of
NATO, except for Donald Trump,” a stentorian male voice intones in an ad
released this week by the Biden campaign. “Trump wants to walk away from
NATO. He’s even given Putin and Russia the green light to attack
America’s allies. … No president has ever said anything like it. It’s
shameful. It’s weak. It’s dangerous. It’s un-American.”</p>
<p>The divide was further compounded by the death last week of
opposition leader Alexey Navalny in a Russian prison.</p>
<p>Biden has been quick to lay blame and threaten stiff sanctions over
the 47-year-old’s death in an Arctic penal colony, which Russian
officials say was caused by “sudden death syndrome.”</p>
<p>“The fact of the matter is, Putin is responsible,” Biden said.
“Whether he ordered it, he’s responsible for the circumstances they put
that man in. And it’s a reflection of who he is. It just cannot be
tolerated. I said there will be a price to pay.”</p>
<p>The Kremlin said Biden’s allegation is “unfounded” and “insolent,”
but authorities have denied Navalny’s mother access to his body.</p>
<p>A different line</p>
<p>Trump and his Republican Party have taken a different line, with
Trump saying he would not support NATO as strongly as Biden has. And, in
a recent event with Fox News, he cast himself as a victim of political
persecution, like Navalny.</p>
<p>“It’s a horrible thing, but it’s happening in our country, too,”
Trump said Tuesday night. “We are turning into a communist country in
many ways. And if you look at it, I’m the leading candidate. I get … I
never heard of being indicted before. … I got indicted four times, I
have eight or nine trials, all because of the fact that — and you know
this — all because of the fact that I’m in politics.”</p>
<p>Trump was vague on how he’d end the war, instead saying that if he
were president, Putin would never have invaded Ukraine.</p>
<p>Republicans have grown more vocal in questioning why they should fund
the conflict. Russian forces recently captured a key Ukrainian city,
Avdiivka, which the White House points to as proof that Ukrainian forces
need urgent help.</p>
<p>In urging members of Congress to pass a $60 billion aid package for
Ukraine, national security adviser Jake Sullivan argued it is “in our
cold-blooded, national security interest to help Ukraine stand up to
Putin’s vicious and brutal invasion.”</p>
<p>“We know from history that when dictators aren’t stopped, they keep
going,” Sullivan told reporters this week in a briefing. “The cost for
America rises, and the consequences get more and more severe for our
NATO allies and elsewhere in the world.”</p>
<p>Some Republicans are confident that they will pass the stalled $95
billion aid package, most of which is for Ukraine.</p>
<p>“I think the slow response from Europe and the United States, of
course, that hurts Ukraine,” Republican Representative Brian Fitzpatrick
said on a recent visit to Ukraine. “And that’s why we can’t let this
happen, why we’re going to get something done.”</p>
<p>War’s symbolism grows</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as Ukraine nears the second anniversary of the invasion
and U.S. aid hangs in the balance, the war has taken on greater symbolic
meaning.</p>
<p>“This has become about America,” journalist and author Peter
Pomerantsev told VOA’s Russian Service via Skype. He is also a senior
fellow at the SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University. “Will
America continue to play the role of a power that keeps its promises,
that respects its alliances and that is capable of projecting
strength?</p>
<p>“Or is America over as a serious power? That’s the question now,” he
said. “It’s no longer about Russia or Ukraine. Now all eyes of the world
are on America, and the way America decides will have epic
consequences.”</p>
<p>VOA’s Rafael R. Saakyan contributed to this report from
Washington.</p>

<h2 id="are-there-any-gutsy-nyt-op-ed-columnists">Are there any gutsy
NYT op-ed columnists?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-22, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Certainly <i>one</i> of the NYT columnists must have noticed that the
management is playing a dangerous game with our election.
</p>
<p>
When are they going to write a column raising the question of how
non-transparent the process is, and how dangerous it has become.
</p>
<p>
Might take a bit of courage to do that, and being willing to put your
career on the line, for all of us.
</p>
<p>
Just asking the question, even if they fired you, seems as big an issue
as the question raised by the special prosecutor re Biden’s age?
</p>
<p>
I’ve been a columnist for a somewhat major publication myself, and I
promise you, if I were witnessing what’s going on at the NYT, I’d submit
the column, and if they didn’t run it, I’d offer it to their
competitors, and if they wouldn’t take it, I’d run it publicly on a
blog, and say that they wouldn’t run it.
</p>
<p>
You can’t really witness something like this without speaking up. They
gave you the platform, you should use it.

id="alleged-japanese-crime-boss-accused-of-trafficking-nuclear-material">Alleged
Japanese Crime Boss Accused of Trafficking Nuclear Material</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — A leader of a Japan-based crime syndicate conspired to
traffic uranium and plutonium from Myanmar in the belief that Iran would
use it to make nuclear weapons, U.S. prosecutors alleged Wednesday. </p>
<p>Takeshi Ebisawa, 60, and his confederates showed samples of nuclear
materials that had been transported from Myanmar to Thailand to an
undercover Drug Enforcement Administration agent posing as a narcotics
and weapons trafficker who had access to an Iranian general, according
to federal officials. The nuclear material was seized, and samples were
later found to contain uranium and weapons-grade plutonium. </p>
<p>“As alleged, the defendants in this case trafficked in drugs, weapons
and nuclear material — going so far as to offer uranium and
weapons-grade plutonium fully expecting that Iran would use it for
nuclear weapons,” DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said in a statement.
“This is an extraordinary example of the depravity of drug traffickers
who operate with total disregard for human life.” </p>
<p>The nuclear material came from an unidentified leader of an “ethic
insurgent group” in Myanmar who had been mining uranium in the country,
according to prosecutors. Ebisawa had proposed that the leader sell
uranium through him in order to fund a weapons purchase from the
general, court documents allege. </p>
<p>According to prosecutors, the insurgent leader provided samples,
which a U.S. federal lab found contained uranium, thorium and plutonium,
and that “the isotope composition of the plutonium” was weapons-grade,
meaning enough of it would be suitable for use in a nuclear weapon. </p>
<p>Ebisawa, who prosecutors allege is a leader of a Japan-based
international crime syndicate, was among four people who were arrested
in April 2022 in Manhattan during a DEA sting operation. He has been
jailed awaiting trial and is among two defendants named in a superseding
indictment. Ebisawa is charged with the international trafficking of
nuclear materials, conspiracy to commit that crime, and several other
counts. </p>
<p>An email seeking comment was sent to Ebisawa’s attorney, Evan Loren
Lipton. </p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said Ebisawa trafficked the material
from Myanmar to other countries. </p>
<p>“He allegedly did so while believing that the material was going to
be used in the development of a nuclear weapons program, and the
weapons-grade plutonium he trafficked, if produced in sufficient
quantities, could have been used for that purpose,” Williams said in the
news release. “Even as he allegedly attempted to sell nuclear materials,
Ebisawa also negotiated for the purchase of deadly weapons, including
surface-to-air missiles.” </p>
<p>The defendants are scheduled to be arraigned Thursday in federal
court in Manhattan.</p>

Cancels Federal Student Loans for Nearly 153,000 Borrowers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CULVER CITY, Calif. — President Joe Biden said Wednesday that while a
college degree was still a ticket to a better life, that ticket is often
too expensive, as he announced he was canceling federal student loans
for nearly 153,000 borrowers.</p>
<p>Biden, who is in the midst of a three-day campaign swing through
California, made the announcement as part of a new repayment plan that
offers a faster path to forgiveness, putting the spotlight on his debt
cancellation efforts in his reelection campaign.</p>
<p>“Too many Americans are still saddled with unsustainable debt in
exchange for a college degree,” he said from a local library before he
went on to campaign-related events. Loan relief helps the greater
economy, he said, because “when people have a student debt relief, they
buy homes. They start businesses, they contribute. They engage.”</p>
<p>The administration began sending email notifications on Wednesday to
some of the borrowers who will benefit from what the White House has
called the SAVE program. The cancellations were originally scheduled to
start in July, but last month the administration said it would be ready
almost six months ahead of schedule, in February.</p>
<p>“Starting today, the first round of folks who are enrolled in our
SAVE student loan repayment plan who have paid their loans for 10 years
and borrowed $12,000 or less will have their debt cancelled,” Biden
posted on social media Wednesday. “That’s 150,000 Americans and
counting. And we’re pushing to relieve more.”</p>
<p>The first round of forgiveness from the SAVE plan will clear $1.2
billion in loans. The borrowers will get emails with a message from
Biden notifying them that “all or a portion of your federal student
loans will be forgiven because you qualify for early loan forgiveness
under my Administration’s SAVE Plan.”</p>
<p>In his email to borrowers, Biden wrote he had heard from “countless
people who have told me that relieving the burden of their student loan
debt will allow them to support themselves and their families, buy their
first home, start a small business, and move forward with life plans
they’ve put on hold.”</p>
<p>More than 7.5 million people have enrolled in the new repayment
plan.</p>
<p>He said Wednesday that it was the kind of relief “that can be
life-changing for individuals and their families.”</p>
<p>“I’m proud to have been able to give borrowers like so many of you
the relief you earned,” he said, asking the crowd gathered for his
speech how many had debt forgiven. Many raised their hands.</p>
<p>Borrowers are eligible for cancellation if they are enrolled in the
SAVE plan, originally borrowed $12,000 or less to attend college and
have made at least 10 years of payments. Those who took out more than
$12,000 will be eligible for cancellation but on a longer timeline. For
each $1,000 borrowed beyond $12,000, it adds an additional year of
payments on top of 10 years.</p>
<p>The maximum repayment period is capped at 20 years for those with
only undergraduate loans and 25 years for those with any graduate school
loans.</p>
<p>Biden announced the new repayment plan last year alongside a separate
plan to cancel up to $20,000 in loans for millions of Americans. The
Supreme Court struck down his plan for widespread forgiveness, but the
repayment plan has so far escaped that level of legal scrutiny. Unlike
his proposal for mass cancellation — which had never been done before —
the repayment plan is a twist on existing income-based plans created by
Congress more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>Biden said he remained steadfast in his commitment to “fix our broken
student loan system,” working around the court’s ruling to find other
ways to get it done.</p>

<h2 id="why-clean-energy-projects-are-stalling-out-on-native-lands">Why
Clean Energy Projects Are Stalling Out on Native Lands</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-22, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTUyODEwNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NzQyOTY2MH0.y5GsP87im-X8qP6a99SfiiAAtrxCnoDqLS8cZ9P36LU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
It’s windy in the Great Plains and it’s sunny in the Southwest. These
two basic geographic facts underscore much of the green energy
transition in the United States — and put many Native American tribes
squarely in the middle of that process.
</p>
<p>
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory
<a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/57748.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has
estimated</a> that “American Indian land comprises approximately 2% of
U.S. land but contains an estimated 5% of all renewable energy
resources,” with an especially large amount of potential solar power.
Over the past few months, a spate of renewable energy projects across
the country have found themselves entangled with courts, regulators, and
tribal governments over how and under what circumstances they are
permitted on — or even near — tribal lands.
</p>
<p>
In Oklahoma, a federal judge ordered that
<a href="https://tulsaworld.com/news/local/indigenous/judge-orders-removal-of-wind-farm-opposed-by-osage-nation/article_4b8a68a0-a013-11ee-b127-77bf0d501d98.html" target="_blank">dozens
of wind turbines be removed</a> after ruling that the developers had
violated federal law by not seeking mineral
rights<em><strong>.</strong></em> In Arizona,
<a href="https://www.archaeologysouthwest.org/wp-content/uploads/Updated-Press-Release-Tribes-File-Federal-Lawsuit-to-Halt-Sunzia-Project-and-Protect-Sacred-and-Historic-Sites.pdf" target="_blank">two
tribes and two nonprofits sued</a> the Bureau of Land Management,
objecting to the planned route of a massive transmission project. Tribes
<a href="https://ctclusi.org/tribe-disappointed-with-wind-energy-decision-citing-failure-of-boem-to-honor-its-obligations-to-tribe-and-impacts-to-fisheries-cultural-resources-and-heritage/" target="_blank">objected
to designating</a> an area off the Oregon coast for wind farming, and
federal energy regulators announced a new policy requiring energy
developers to get tribal permission prior to seeking any permits for
projects on tribal lands.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>“We are establishing a new policy that the Commission will
not issue preliminary permits for projects proposing to use Tribal lands
if the Tribe on whose lands the project is to be located opposes the
permit,”
<a href="https://ferc.gov/media/h-5-p-15309-000" target="_blank">the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</a> said in a filing denying a trio
of pumped-storage hydropower projects on Navajo Nation land in Arizona
and New Mexico.
</p>
<p>
“Navajo Nation is in support of solar power, and the Navajo utility has
<a href="https://www.ntua.com/caresactsolar.html" target="_blank">developed
some solar sites</a>, which are operating right now,” George Hardeen,
public relations director for the Navajo Nation leadership, told me.
“But pumped storage, we’re not quite ready for that.” Just like everyone
else in Arizona, New Mexico, or neighboring states, the Navajo Nation
has a heavily contested relationship with its surrounding water
resources. The Navajo Nation recently lost a case in the Supreme Court,
where it argued the federal government had an obligation to
<a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2023/06/supreme-court-rules-5-4-against-navajo-nation-in-water-rights-dispute/" target="_blank">meet
its water needs</a> under 1868 and 1849 treaties.
</p>
<p>
While the legal issues around tribal governance are distinct, the
dilemmas and tradeoffs of energy development — renewable or otherwise —
are not. Energy production itself is nothing new for the Navajo Nation.
The
<a href="https://media.srpnet.com/navajo-generating-station-permanently-shuts-down/" target="_blank">now-shuttered
Navajo Generating Station</a> operated for almost 50 years with a
workforce that was almost exclusively Navajo. Along with a neighboring
mine, it generated tens of millions of dollars of royalty and other
payments for the Navajo Nation and the neighboring Hopi Tribe.
</p>
<p>
But the competing goals of speedy renewable energy development versus
protection of the landscape become heightened on native lands.<br/>
</p>
<p>
“You’ve always had consultation requirements,” Heather Tanana, a
visiting professor at the University of California-Irvine, told me. “The
big change is the weight of the tribal voice in that process,”
describing FERC’s policy as a “shift to actual empowerment of tribal
communities who decide what is going to happen.”
</p>
<p>
FERC’s decision is consistent with a Biden administration-wide effort to
empower tribes on a “nation-to-nation” basis. This effort has naturally
heavily involved the Department of Interior — led for the first time by
a Native American, Pueblo of Laguna member Deb Haaland — which oversees
the Bureau of Indian Affairs, as well as a bevy of agencies including
the Bureau of Land Management and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management,
which play major roles in energy infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
“Having the agency take this position is consistent is what the
administration has said it should do,” Tanana said. “It’s good because
it shows something tangible and real, and not just good intentions that
haven’t always played out well in the past.”
</p>
<p>
That’s putting it mildly. The history of energy development and Native
Americans is marked by exploitation, whether the subject is the
<a href="https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=OS005" target="_blank">Osage
murders</a> of the 1920s,
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3222290/" target="_blank">lung
cancer</a> among Navajo uranium mine workers, or the construction of
dams that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/klamath-river-iron-gate-dam" target="_blank">obliterated
native fishing grounds</a>.
</p>
<p>
“The Biden administration is very sensitive to tribal concerns,” Warigia
Bowman, a law professor at the University of Tulsa, told me. But
enforcement of the new requirements will be up to regulators and
prosecutors across the country, Bowman said.<br/>
</p>
<p>
That enforcement has been especially harsh in Osage County. Typically,
landowners control both the surface and mineral rights of their land,
which essentially means they can sell both the land they own and the
rights to what’s underneath it. But the mineral rights on the Osage
Nation Reservation are exclusively owned by the Osage Tribe and overseen
by the elected Osage Minerals Council, which can lease out mineral
rights. And, like many in the petroleum business, the Osage Minerals
Council has
<a href="https://osagenews.org/osage-minerals-council-oil-and-gas-is-here-to-stay/" target="_blank">lamented
limitations on drilling</a>.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>“What’s special about the Osage wind case is the specifics
of land ownership for the Osage,” Bowman said. “It’s unusual to have
surface and mineral rights separated.”
</p>
<p>
It’s these mineral rights that have turned into a massive headache for
wind developers. The energy developers Enel and Osage Wind leased over
8,000 acres in Osage County for a wind farm starting in 2010. The Osage
Minerals Council sued in 2011, saying the project would block its
ability to develop any resources underneath the area the developers had
leased. Then the federal government sued in 2014 when construction
began, arguing that the excavation for the wind turbines’ foundations
constituted mining without permission.
</p>
<p>
Late last year, a federal judge ruled that the developers owed monetary
damages and the “ejectment of the wind towers.” The developers estimated
that complying with the injunction
<a href="https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/2024/02/17/osage-nation-oklahoma-wind-farm-ruling-wake-up-call/72538442007/" target="_blank">would
cost almost $260 million</a>.
</p>
<p>
And energy development doesn’t have to be on tribal land in order to
potentially run afoul of laws and regulations mandating consultation.
The Tohono O’odham Nation and San Carlos Apache Tribe, along with the
nonprofit groups the Center for Biological Diversity and Archeological
Southwest, sued the Bureau of Land Management seeking an injunction to
stop construction of the SunZia transmission line,
<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/29052023/sunzia-transmission-project-approval/" target="_blank">a
decades-in-the-waiting</a> 4,500 megawatt project that seeks to bring
wind energy west from New Mexico. The project got approval from BLM last
spring. The suit filed in January argued that the developers failed to
adequately consult with tribes over “sacred and cultural resources in
the San Pedro Valley,” even if the
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/tribal-lawsuits-threaten-bidens-clean-energy-push/" target="_blank">proposed
route</a> was on a mixture of federal, state, and private land.
</p>
<p>
“Under the [National Historic Preservation Act], agencies are required
to make a good faith effort to identify Indian tribes for consultation,”
Tory Fodder, a law professor at the University of Arizona, explained to
me in an email. “The NHPA provides fairly robust consultation mechanisms
for tribal cultural and religious sites that are not necessarily
confined to the reservation of a tribe.” Since, Fodder said, both the
Tohono O’odham Nation and the San Carlos Apache claim “ancestral
connections to the area,” they should have been consulted early
on.<del></del>
</p>
<p>
The BLM and Pattern Energy both claim they were. In a response to the
suit, the
<a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/eenews/f/eenews/?id=0000018d-a86b-dff1-a7df-edfb35060000" target="_blank">federal
government argued</a> that it had “engaged in lengthy, good faith
consultation efforts with the Tribes and other consulting parties
regarding the San Pedro Valley,” and that the route had been finalized
since 2015, giving the tribes and nonprofits years to intervene.
</p>
<p>
In an emailed statement, Pattern Energy’s vice president of
environmental and permitting, Natalie McCue, said: “Respecting tribal
sovereignty and completing the United States’ largest clean energy
project is not a binary choice. We deeply respect the Tohono O’odham
Nation’s and the San Carlos Apache Tribe’s right to self-governance and
to express their views on cultural protection. Given this, we were
saddened by the decision to pursue legal action, especially given our
commitment to open, good-faith dialogue on these vital issues.” Oral
arguments in the case are scheduled for March; in the meantime,
construction has been allowed to continue.
</p>
<p>
On the West Coast, there’s growing tribal opposition to the beginning of
a process for offshore wind development. The Confederated Tribes of the
Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians said they were “extremely
disappointed” in the Bureau Ocean Energy Management’s decision to
designate two areas off the Oregon coast
<a href="https://www.boem.gov/newsroom/press-releases/boem-finalizes-wind-energy-areas-oregon" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">for
wind energy development</a>.
</p>
<p>
While the BOEM said the designation only came after “extensive
engagement and feedback from the state, Tribes, local residents, ocean
users, federal government partners, and other members of the public,”
the Confederated Tribes contend that the areas “are within the Tribe’s
ancestral territory, contain viewsheds of significant cultural and
historic significance to the Tribe, and are important areas for Tribal
fishing,” and that the Tribes only became aware of the designation from
the Oregon Governor’s office, not the BOEM directly.
</p>
<p>
Although the stakes of the zero-carbon transition are new, the issues of
sovereignty and exploitation of Native American lands are as old as the
United States. “The Tribe will not stand by while a project is developed
that causes it more harm than good,” the Tribal Council Chair Brad
Kneaper said in a release. “This is simply green colonialism.”
