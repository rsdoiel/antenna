technical writer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-30, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti</p>
<p>
I’ve been using large language models (LLMs) for a while now. They
accelerate and improve my output at work, to the point that losing
access to them would make me feel slightly impaired in some areas.
Rather than fearing <em>WriterBot</em>, I’m embracing the additional
capabilities it grants. At the same time, I’m extremely conscious of
their limitations,
<a href="https://passo.uno/ai-anxiety-tech-writer-howto/">which are
abundant</a>. Let me tell you how LLMs are helping me in my everyday
work as a documentation engineer and where they’re unable to assist me.

<p>date: 2024-10-30, from: Bunnie’s Studio Blog</p>
<p>The Ware for October 2024 is shown below. This one should be a smidge
easier to guess than last month’s ware. The main reason I liked this
ware is actually the board shown below with the prominent star-routing.
It’s such traditional hand-routing work, I love craftsmanship like this.
For completeness, this is the top side […]</p>

<p>Last month’s Ware was a Cue COVID test reader. It uses LAMP
(loop-mediated isothermal amplification) to perform a fast and sensitive
detection of nucleic acid sequences. Thanks again to Curtis Galloway for
contributing this ware for me to take apart and photograph! Nobody had
guessed the ware exactly, but “microfluidic lab on a chip” is […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-30, from: Retro Innovations blog</p>
<p>Understanding lowercase functionality on the Motorola MC6847 Video
Display Generator (VDG) I’ll be honest, I rarely use lowercase
characters on any of the classic computers I use. Back in the day, of
course, I needed them when writing posts on BBS systems, composing
school papers, and writing general correspondence (my handwriting was
never great). Still, …

<h2 id="support">Support</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-30, from: Ed Summers blog, Inkdroid</p>
<p>
I like <a href="https://www.mollywhite.net/">Molly White</a>’s <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTaeVVAvk-c">idea</a> that the web
isn’t just a place for big corporations. It’s a place where we can try
new things, and support others that are doing work that helps and
inspires us.
</p>
<p>
The early web was marked by a lot of idealism, which has turned out to
have been way off the mark given the degree to which we are exploited
online. But not all the web is this way. We have more autonomy and
agency than we think. We are able to experiment in ways that big tech
can’t. We can wire things together in ways that they won’t, and talk
about things that they won’t, and focus on our communities and co-ops
and unions in ways that they can’t and won’t. And we can choose to
support the people we see building the web this way.
</p>
<p>
It’s a simple idea, but worth watching the whole talk to fully
understand this point she is making.
</p>

</iframe>
<p>
With that in mind, I thought it would be kind of fun to add a page to my
website listing the people and projects I choose to financially support
who work on the web. You can find it <a
href="/support/">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
I was wondering, is there a way to markup the HTML to indicate that I
support these projects?
</p>
<p>
The primary purpose is to communicate this list to other people, so
there’s not really a strong use case for marking it up so it could be
understood by software. But I do like how tools like [StreetPass] can
discover people in the Fediverse as you browse the web.
</p>
<p>
I suppose there’s probably some way to cobble something together with
<a href="https://schema.org">schema.org</a> or <a
href="https://microformats.org">Microformats</a>, but perhaps something
a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_URI">well-known-URI</a>
for discovery would be helpful?
