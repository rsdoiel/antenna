<h2 id="ships-aircraft-search-for-missing-navy-seals-after-mission-to-seize-iranian-missile-parts">Ships, Aircraft Search for Missing Navy Seals After Mission to Seize Iranian Missile Parts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Navy ships and aircraft combed areas of the Gulf of Aden for two missing U.S. Navy SEALs on Monday as details emerged about their mission to board and take over a vessel carrying components for medium-range Iranian ballistic missiles headed for Somalia, a U.S. defense official said Monday.</p>
<p>The official said crew on the dhow, which did not have a country flag, were planning to transfer the missile parts, including warheads and engines, to another boat off the coast of Somalia. The Navy recognized the boat as one with a history of transporting illegal weapons from Iran to Somalia, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details not made public.</p>
<p>The SEALs were on the USS Lewis B. Puller, a Navy expeditionary sea base vessel, and traveled in small special operations combat craft driven by naval special warfare crew to get to the boat. As they were boarding it in rough seas, around 8 p.m. local time, one SEAL got knocked off by high waves and a teammate went in after him. Both are missing.</p>
<p>The team boarding the small boat was facing about a dozen crew members. The crew members, who were taken into custody, had no paperwork, which allowed a search of the vessel. The weapons were confiscated, and the boat was sunk, a routine procedure that usually involves blowing open holes in the hull.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have said that the waters in the Gulf of Aden are warm, and Navy SEALs are trained for such emergencies. On Monday, Navy ships, helicopters and drones were involved in the ongoing search.</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy has conducted regular interdiction missions in the region, also intercepting weapons on ships that were bound for Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen.</p>
<p>Officials have said that the SEAL mission was not related to Operation Prosperity Guardian, the ongoing U.S. and international mission to provide protection to commercial vessels in the Red Sea, or the retaliatory strikes that the United States and the United Kingdom have conducted in Yemen over the past two days.</p>

<h2 id="google-is-no-longer-bringing-the-full-chrome-browser-to-fuchsia">Google is no longer bringing the full Chrome browser to Fuchsia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>In contrast to that minimal experience, Google was seemingly working to bring the full might of Chrome to Fuchsia. To observers, this was yet another signal that Google intended for Fuchsia to grow beyond the smart home and serve as a full desktop operating system. After all, what good is a laptop or desktop without a web browser? Fans of the Fuchsia project have anticipated its eventual expansion to desktop since Fuchsia was first shown to run on Google’s Pixelbook hardware. However, in the intervening time – a period that also saw significant layoffs in the Fuchsia division – it seems that Google has since shifted Fuchsia in a different direction. The clearest evidence of that move comes from a Chromium code change (and related bug tracker post) published last month declaring that the “Chrome browser on fuchsia won’t be maintained.” ↫ Kyle Bradshaw at 9To5Google Up until a few years ago, every indication was that Google had big plans for Fuchsia, from “workstation” builds to porting Chrome to developers using Fuchsia for Google Meet calls, and lots of other improvements, changes, and additions that pointed squarely at Fuchsia being prepped for use on more than just the Nest Hub devices. We’re about a year later now, and everything has changed. The workstation builds have been discontinued, the Fuchsia team was hit harder by the Google layoffs than other teams, and now the Chrome port has been deprecated. All signs now point to Fuchsia being effectively a dead end beyond its use on Hub devices. At least Google had the decency to kill this before it released it.</p>

<h2 id="effortless-openbsd-audio-and-desktop-screen-recording-guide">Effortless OpenBSD audio and desktop screen recording guide</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Welcome to my comprehensive guide on recording audio and desktop screen on OpenBSD. In this blog post, I’m excited to share my personal setup and approach to efficiently capturing high-quality audio and video on one of the most secure and stable operating systems available. Whether you’re a professional content creator, a developer looking to record tutorials, or simply an OpenBSD enthusiast, this guide is tailored to help you navigate the intricacies of screen recording in this unique environment. Alongside this step-by-step tutorial, I’ve also included a practical YouTube video to demonstrate the quality and effectiveness of the recordings you can achieve with this setup. So, let’s dive in and explore the world of audio and video recording on OpenBSD! ↫ Rafael Sadowski The BSD world needs more of these kinds of guides and articles. I feel like the various BSDs have so much to offer to desktop users, especially now that there is a reasonable contingent of Linux users who aren’t happy with the spread of things like systemd and Wayland, but the fact of the matter is that the BSDs are not as focused on desktop and laptop use as Linux has been. That’s not a dig at BSD developers – BSD focuses on different things – but it does mean that people interested in using BSD on desktops and laptops need a bit more assistance.</p>

The results of our poll asking how frequently you use widgets show that roughly 50% of users never use widgets at all, with 25% to 50% of people using them slightly or heavily. But those numbers are complicated by the availability of three types of widgets on the iPhone and iPad, two on the Mac, and one on the Apple Watch.

<h2 id="us-owned-vessel-hit-by-missile-in-gulf-of-aden">US-Owned Vessel Hit by Missile in Gulf of Aden</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>JERUSALEM — A missile fired from Yemen struck a U.S.-owned ship just off the coast of Yemen in the Gulf of Aden, less than a day after Yemen’s Houthi rebels fired an anti-ship cruise missile toward an American destroyer in the Red Sea, officials said.</p>
<p>Suspicion immediately fell on the Iranian-backed Houthis, though the rebels did not immediately acknowledge carrying out the assault on the Gibraltar Eagle. It marked the latest attack roiling global shipping amid Israel’s war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>The Houthis have targeted that crucial corridor linking Asian and Mideast energy and cargo shipments to the Suez Canal onward to Europe over the war, attacks that threaten to widen that conflict into a regional conflagration.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, which oversees Mideast waters, said Monday’s attack happened some 110 miles (177 kilometers) miles southeast of Aden. It said the ship’s captain reported that the “port side of vessel hit from above by a missile.”</p>
<p>Private security firms Ambrey and Dryad Global told The Associated Press that the vessel was the Gibraltar Eagle, a Marshall Islands-flagged bulk carrier.</p>
<p>The ship is owned by Eagle Bulk, a Stamford, Connecticut-based firm traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The firm did not respond to repeated requests for comment.</p>
<p>Satellite-tracking data analyzed by the AP showed the Gibraltar Eagle had been bound for the Suez Canal, but rapidly turned around at the time of the attack.</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy’s Mideast-based 5th Fleet did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Yemen’s Houthi rebels did not acknowledge any attack, though they have fired missiles previously in that area. </p>
<p>Sunday’s attack toward the American warship also marked the first U.S.-acknowledged fire by the Houthis since America and allied nations began strikes Friday on the rebels following weeks of assaults on shipping in the Red Sea.</p>
<p>It wasn’t presently clear whether the U.S. would retaliate for the latest attacks, though President Joe Biden has said he “will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary.”</p>
<p>The Houthi fire Sunday went in the direction of the USS Laboon, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer operating in the southern reaches of the Red Sea, the U.S. military’s Central Command said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Houthis did not immediately acknowledge that attack either.</p>
<p>The missile came from near Hodeida, a Red Sea port city long held by the Houthis, the U.S. said.</p>
<p>“An anti-ship cruise missile was fired from Iranian-backed Houthi militant areas of Yemen toward USS Laboon,” Central Command said. “There were no injuries or damage reported.”</p>
<p>The first day of U.S.-led strikes Friday hit 28 locations and struck more than 60 targets with cruise missiles and bombs launched by fighter jets, warships and a submarine. Sites hit included weapon depots, radars and command centers, including in remote mountain areas, the U.S. has said.</p>
<p>The Houthis have yet to acknowledge how severe the damage was from the strikes, which they said killed five of their troops and wounded six others.</p>
<p>U.S. forces followed up with a strike Saturday on a Houthi radar site.</p>
<p>Shipping through the Red Sea has slowed over the attacks. The U.S. Navy warned American-flagged vessels Friday to steer clear of areas around Yemen in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden for 72 hours after the initial airstrikes.</p>
<p>For their part, the Houthis alleged without providing evidence that the U.S. struck a site near Hodeida on Sunday around the same time as the cruise missile fire. The Americans and the United Kingdom did not acknowledge conducting any strike — suggesting the blast may have been from a misfiring Houthi missile.</p>
<p>Since November, the rebels have repeatedly targeted ships in the Red Sea, saying they were avenging Israel’s offensive in Gaza against Hamas. But they have frequently targeted vessels with tenuous or no clear links to Israel, imperiling shipping in a key route for global trade.</p>
<p>Even the leader of the Lebanese militant Hezbollah group, Hassan Nasrallah, obliquely referenced the widening Houthi attacks on ships in a speech Sunday, saying that “the sea has become a battlefield of missiles, drones and warships” and blaming the U.S. strikes for escalating maritime tensions.</p>
<p>“The most dangerous thing is what the Americans did in the Red Sea, [it] will harm the security of all maritime navigation,” Nasrallah said.</p>
<p>Though the Biden administration and its allies have tried to calm tensions in the Middle East for weeks and prevent any wider conflict, the strikes in the Red Sea threaten to ignite one.</p>
<p>It’s also affecting shipping for the Middle East nation of Qatar, one of the world’s top natural gas suppliers. Three liquid natural gas tankers that had recently loaded in Qatar and were bound for the Suez Canal remain idling off Oman, while another coming from Europe to Qatar remains off Saudi Arabia. QatarEnergy and government officials did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia, which supports the Yemeni government-in-exile that the Houthis are fighting, sought to distance itself from the attacks on Houthi sites as it tries to maintain a delicate détente with Iran and a cease-fire it has in Yemen. The Saudi-led, U.S.-backed war in Yemen that began in 2015 has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more.</p>
<p>The American military did not specifically say the fire targeted the Laboon, following a pattern by the U.S. since the Houthi attacks began. However, U.S. sailors have received combat ribbons for their actions in the Red Sea — something handed out only to those who face active hostilities with an enemy force.</p>

<h2 id="pluralistic-sympathy-for-the-spammer-15-jan-2024">Pluralistic: Sympathy for the spammer (15 Jan 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Sympathy for the spammer: The desperate and credulous are superspreaders in the botshit pandemic. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Sympathy for the spammer (permalink) In any scam, any con, any hustle, the big winners are the people who supply the scammers – not the scammers themselves. The kids selling dope on the corner are making less than minimum wage, while the respectable crime-bosses who own the labs clean up. Desperate “retail investors” who buy shitcoins from Superbowl ads get skinned, while the MBA bros who issue the coins make millions (in real dollars, not crypto). It’s ever been thus. The California gold rush was a con, and nearly everyone who went west went broke. Famously, the only reliable way to cash out on the gold rush was to sell “picks and shovels” to the credulous, doomed and desperate. That’s how Leland Stanford made his fortune, which he funneled into eugenics programs (and founding a university): https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/malcolm-harris/palo-alto/9780316592031/ That means that the people who try to con you are almost always getting conned themselves. Think of Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) scams. My forthcoming novel The Bezzle opens with a baroque and improbable fast-food Ponzi in the town of Avalon on the island of Catalina, founded by the chicle monopolist William Wrigley Jr: http://thebezzle.org Wrigley found fast food declasse and banned it from the island, a rule that persists to this day. In The Bezzle, the forensic detective Martin Hench uncovers The Fry Guys, an MLM that flash-freezes contraband burgers and fries smuggled on-island from the mainland and sells them to islanders though an “affiliate marketing” scheme that is really about recruiting other affiliate marketers to sell under you. As with every MLM, the value of the burgers and fries sold is dwarfed by the gigantic edifice of finance fraud built around it, with “points” being bought and sold for real cash, which is snaffled up and sucked out of the island by a greedy mainlander who is behind the scheme. A “bezzle” is John Kenneth Galbraith’s term for “the magic interval when a confidence trickster knows he has the money he has appropriated but the victim does not yet understand that he has lost it.” In every scam, there’s a period where everyone feels richer – but only the scammers are actually cleaning up. The wealth of the marks is illusory, but the longer the scammer can preserve the illusion, the more real money the marks will pump into the system. MLMs are particularly ugly, because they target people who are shut out of economic opportunity – women, people of color, working people. These people necessarily rely on social ties for survival, looking after each others’ kids, loaning each other money they can’t afford, sharing what little they have when others have nothing. It’s this social cohesion that MLMs weaponize. Crypto “entrepreneurs” are encouraged to suck in their friends and family by telling them that they’re “building Black wealth.” Working women are exhorted to suck in their bffs by appealing to their sisterhood and the chance for “women to lift each other up.” The “sales people” trying to get you to buy crypto or leggings or supplements are engaged in predatory conduct that will make you financially and socially worse off, wrecking their communities’ finances and shattering the mutual aid survival networks they rely on. But they’re not getting rich on this – they’re also being scammed: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4686468 This really hit home for me in the early 2000s, when I was still editing Boing Boing. We had a submission form where our readers could submit links for us to look at for inclusion on the blog, and it was overwhelmed by spam. We’d add all kinds of antispam to it, and still, we’d get floods of hundreds or even thousands of spam submissions to it. One night, I was lying in my bed in London and watching these spams roll in. They were all for small businesses in the rustbelt, handyman services, lawn-care, odd jobs, that kind of thing. They were 10 million miles from the kind of thing we’d ever post about on Boing Boing. They were coming in so thickly that I literally couldn’t finish downloading my email – the POP session was dropping before I could get all the mail in the spool. I had to ssh into my mail server and delete them by hand. It was maddening. Frustrated and furious, I started calling the phone numbers associated with these small businesses, demanding an explanation. I assumed that they’d hired some kind of sleazy marketing service and I wanted to know who it was so I could give them a piece of my mind. But what I discovered when I got through was much weirder. These people had all been laid off from factories that were shuttering due to globalization. As part of their termination packages, their bosses had offered them “retraining” via “courses” in founding their own businesses. The “courses” were the precursors to the current era’s rise-and-grind hustle-culture scams (again, the only people getting rich from that stuff are the people selling the courses – the “students” finish the course poorer). They promised these laid-off workers, who’d given their lives to their former employers before being discarded, that they just needed to pull themselves up by their own boostraps: https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/10/declaration-of-interdependence/#solidarity-forever After all, we had the internet now! There were so many new opportunities to be your own boss! The course came with a dreadful build-your-own-website service, complete with an overpriced domain sales portal, and a single form for submitting your new business to “thousands of search engines.” This was nearly 20 years ago, but even then, there was really only one search engine that mattered: Google. The “thousands of search engines” the scammers promised to submit these desperate peoples’ websites to were just submission forms for directories, indexes, blogs, and mailing lists. The number of directories, indexes, blogs and mailing lists that would publish their submissions was either “zero” or “nearly zero.” There was certainly no possibility that anyone at Boing Boing would ever press the wrong key and accidentally write a 500-word blog post about a leaf-raking service in a collapsing deindustrialized exurb in Kentucky or Ohio. The people who were drowning me in spam weren’t the scammers – they were the scammees. But that’s only half the story. Years later, I discovered how our submission form was getting included in this get-rich-quick’s mass-submission system. It was a MLM! Coders in the former Soviet Union were getting work via darknet websites that promised them relative pittances for every submission form they reverse-engineered and submitted. The smart coders didn’t crack the forms directly – they recruited other, less business-savvy coders to do that for them, and then often as not, ripped them off. The scam economy runs on this kind of indirection, where scammees are turned into scammers, who flood useful and productive and nice spaces with useless dross that doesn’t even make them any money. Take the submission queue at Clarkesworld, the great online science fiction magazine, which famously had to close after it was flooded with thousands of junk submission “written” by LLMs: https://www.npr.org/2023/02/24/1159286436/ai-chatbot-chatgpt-magazine-clarkesworld-artificial-intelligence There was a zero percent chance that Neil Clarke would accidentally accept one of these submissions. They were uniformly terrible. The people submitting these “stories” weren’t frustrated sf writers who’d discovered a “life hack” that let them turn out more brilliant prose at scale. They were scammers who’d been scammed into thinking that AIs were the key to a life of passive income, a 4-Hour Work-Week powered by an AI-based self-licking ice-cream cone: https://pod.link/1651876897/episode/995c8a778ede17d2d7cff393e5203157 This is absolutely classic passive-income brainworms thinking. “I have a bot that can turn out plausible sentences. I will locate places where sentences can be exchanged for money, aim my bot at it, sit back, and count my winnings.” It’s MBA logic on meth: find a thing people pay for, then, without bothering to understand why they pay for that thing, find a way to generate something like it at scale and bombard them with it. Con artists start by conning themselves, with the idea that “you can’t con an honest man.” But the factor that predicts whether someone is connable isn’t their honesty – it’s their desperation. The kid selling drugs on the corner, the mom desperately DMing her high-school friends to sell them leggings, the cousin who insists that you get in on their shitcoin – they’re all doing it because the system is rigged against them, and getting worse every day. These people reason – correctly – that all the people getting really rich are scamming. If Amazon can make $38b/year selling “ads” that push worse products that cost more to the top of their search results, why should the mere fact that an “opportunity” is obviously predatory and fraudulent disqualify it? https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/29/aethelred-the-unready/#not-one-penny-for-tribute The quest for passive income is really the quest for a “greater fool,” the economist’s term for the person who relieves you of the useless crap you just overpaid for. It rots the mind, atomizes communities, shatters solidarity and breeds cynicism: https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/24/passive-income/#swiss-cheese-security The rise and rise of botshit cannot be separated from this phenomenon. The botshit in our search-results, our social media feeds, and our in-boxes isn’t making money for the enshittifiers who send it – rather, they are being hustled by someone who’s selling them the “picks and shovels” for the AI gold rush: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/03/botshit-generative-ai-imminent-threat-democracy That’s the true cost of all the automation-driven unemployment criti-hype: while we’re nowhere near a place where bots can steal your job, we’re certainly at the point where your boss can be suckered into firing you and replacing you with a bot that fails at doing your job: https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/11/robots-stole-my-jerb/#computer-says-no The manic “entrepreneurs” who’ve been stampeded into panic by the (correct) perception that the economy is a game of musical chairs where the number of chairs is decreasing at breakneck speed are easy marks for the Leland Stanfords of AI, who are creating generational wealth for themselves by promising that their bots will automate away all the tedious work that goes into creating value. Expect a lot more Amazon Marketplace products called “I’m sorry, I cannot fulfil this request as it goes against OpenAI use policy”: https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/12/24036156/openai-policy-amazon-ai-listings No one’s going to buy these products, but the AI picks-and-shovels people will still reap a fortune from the attempt. And because history repeats itself, these newly minted billionaires are continuing Leland Stanford’s love affair with eugenics: https://www.truthdig.com/dig-series/eugenics/ The fact that AI spam doesn’t pay is important to the fortunes of AI companies. Most high-value AI applications are very risk-intolerant (self-driving cars, radiology analysis, etc). An AI tool might help a human perform these tasks more accurately – by warning them of things that they’ve missed – but that’s not how AI will turn a profit. There’s no market for AI that makes your workers cost more but makes them better at their jobs: https://locusmag.com/2023/12/commentary-cory-doctorow-what-kind-of-bubble-is-ai/ Plenty of people think that spam might be the elusive high-value, low-risk AI application. But that’s just not true. The point of AI spam is to get clicks from people who are looking for better content. It’s SEO. No one reads 2,000 words of algorithm-pleasing LLM garbage over an omelette recipe and then subscribes to that site’s feed. And the omelette recipe generates pennies for the spammer that posted it. They are doing massive volume in order to make those pennies into dollars. You don’t make money by posting one spam. If every spammer had to pay the actual recovery costs (energy, chillers, capital amortization, wages) for their query, every AI spam would lose (lots of) money. Hustle culture and passive income are about turning other peoples’ dollars into your dimes. It is a negative-sum activity, a net drain on society. Behind every seemingly successful “passive income” is a con artist who’s getting rich by promising – but not delivering – that elusive passive income, and then blaming the victims for not hustling hard enough: https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/12/blueprint-trouble (Image: Cryteria, CC BY 3.0, modified) Hey look at this (permalink) It’s Time to Nationalize and Then Break Up Boeing https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/its-time-to-nationalize-and-then This day in history (permalink) #15yrsago Wingsuit base jumpers are human flying squirrels — video https://vimeo.com/1778399 #10yrsago RIP, Neal Barret Junior https://locusmag.com/2014/01/neal-barrett-jr-1929-2014/ #10yrsago Patent mess goes to the Supreme Court https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/01/supreme-court-looks-to-rein-in-top-patent-court-with-two-new-cases/ #10yrsago Requirements for DRM in HTML5 are a secret https://memex.craphound.com/2014/01/14/requirements-for-drm-in-html5-are-a-secret/ #10yrsago NSA official: mass spying has foiled one (or fewer) plots in its whole history https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/10/nsa-mass-surveillance-powers-john-inglis-npr #5yrsago From the empty, shutdown IRS, automated processes are sending out property seizure notices, and no human can stop them https://theintercept.com/2019/01/14/irs-shutdown-federal-government-shut-down-irs-asset-seizures/ #5yrsago Google Walkout meets #MeToo in a new anti-arbitration campaign https://endforcedarbitration.medium.com/googlers-for-ending-forced-arbitration-launch-public-education-campaign-via-social-media-e46d7608cd0e #5yrsago Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez reaches more people on Twitter than the press and establishment Democrats https://www.axios.com/2019/01/13/ocasio-cortez-dominates-twitter #5yrsago In LA, the teachers of America’s largest school district are on strike https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/14/la-teachers-working-class-power-labor-strikes #1yrago Kate Beaton’s “Ducks” https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/14/hark-an-oilpatch/#kate-beaton Colophon (permalink) Today’s top sources: Currently writing: A Little Brother short story about DIY insulin PLANNING Picks and Shovels, a Martin Hench noir thriller about the heroic era of the PC.

<p>
Roughly 1 million people volunteer to work at polls during presidential elections, but recruiting enough poll workers remains a perennial challenge. Those staff shortages can add to wait times at the polls, which, in turn, can depress voter turnout. Now, as many poll workers grow older and end their service, advocacy groups are pushing for young people to step up. Also: Who says college is just for the young?

<h2 id="a-surgeon-general-report-once-cleared-the-air-about-smoking.-is-it-time-for-one-on-vaping">A Surgeon General Report Once Cleared the Air About Smoking. Is it Time for One on Vaping?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Sixty years ago, the U.S. surgeon general released a report that settled a longstanding public debate about the dangers of cigarettes and led to huge changes in smoking in America.  </p>
<p>Today, some public health experts say a similar report could help clear the air about vaping.  </p>
<p>Many U.S. adults believe nicotine vaping is as harmful as — or more dangerous than — cigarette smoking. That’s wrong. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and most scientists agree that, based on available evidence, electronic cigarettes are far less dangerous than traditional cigarettes.  </p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean e-cigarettes are harmless either. And public health experts disagree about exactly how harmful, or helpful, the devices are. Clarifying information is urgently needed, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University.  </p>
<p>“There have been so many confusing messages about vaping,” Gostin said. “A surgeon general’s report could clear that all up.”  </p>
<p>One major obstacle: E-cigarettes haven’t been around long enough for scientists to see if vapers develop problems like lung cancer and heart disease.  </p>
<p>“There’s a remarkable lack of evidence,” said Dr. Kelly Henning, who leads the public health program at Bloomberg Philanthropies.</p>
<p>Smoking and Vaping</p>
<p>Cigarette smoking has long been described as the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention puts the annual toll at 480,000 lives. That count should start to fall around 2030, according to a study published last year by the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, thanks in part to a decline in smoking rates that began in the 1960s.  </p>
<p>Back then, ashtrays were everywhere and more than 42% of U.S. adults smoked.  </p>
<p>On Jan. 11, 1964, U.S. Surgeon General Luther Terry released an authoritative report that said smoking causes illness and death — and the government should do something about it. The report is considered a watershed moment: In the decades that followed, warning labels were put on cigarette packs, cigarette commercials were banned, governments raised tobacco taxes and new restrictions were placed on where people could light up.  </p>
<p>By 2022, the adult smoking rate was 11%.  </p>
<p>Some experts believe e-cigarettes deserve some of the credit. The devices were billed as a way to help smokers quit, and the FDA has authorized a handful of e-cigarettes as less-harmful alternatives for adult smokers.  </p>
<p>Vaping’s popularity exploded in the 2010s, among both adults but and teens. In 2014, e-cigarettes surpassed combustible cigarettes as the tobacco product that youth used the most. By 2019, 28% of high schoolers were vaping.</p>
<p>U.S. health officials sounded alarms, fearing that kids hooked on nicotine would rediscover cigarettes. That hasn’t happened. Last year, the high school smoking rate was less than 2% — far lower than the 35% rate seen about 25 years ago.</p>
<p>“That’s a great public health triumph. It’s an almost unbelievable one,” said Kenneth Warner, who studies tobacco-control policies at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>“If it weren’t for e-cigarettes, I think we would be hearing the public health community shouting at the top of their lungs about the success of getting kids not to smoke,” he said.</p>
<p>Vaping’s Benefits and Harms</p>
<p>Cigarettes have been called the deadliest consumer product ever invented. Their smoke contains thousands of chemicals, at least 69 of which can cause cancer. </p>
<p>The vapor from e-cigarettes has been estimated to contain far fewer chemicals, and fewer carcinogens. Some toxic substances are present in both, but show up in much lower concentrations in e-cigarette vapor than in cigarette smoke.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that smokers who completely switch to vaping have better lung function and see other health improvements.</p>
<p>“I would much rather see someone vaping than smoking a Marlboro. There is no question in my mind that vaping is safer,” said Donald Shopland, who was a clerk for the committee that generated the 1964 report and is co-author of a forthcoming book on it.</p>
<p>But what about the dangers to people who have never smoked?</p>
<p>There have been 100 to 200 studies looking at vaping, and they are a mixed bag, said Dr. Neal Benowitz, of the University of California, San Francisco, a leading academic voice on nicotine and tobacco addiction. The studies used varying techniques, and many were limited in their ability to separate the effects of vaping from former cigarettes smoking, he said.</p>
<p>“If you look at the research, it’s all over the map,” Warner said.</p>
<p>Studies have detected bronchitis symptoms and aggravation of asthma in young people who vape. Research also indicates vaping also can affect the cells that line the blood vessels and heart, leading to looks for a link to heart disease. Perhaps the most cited concern is nicotine, the stimulant that makes cigarettes and vapes addictive.</p>
<p>Animal studies suggest nicotine exposure in adolescents can affect development of the area of the brain responsible for attention, learning and impulse control. Some research in people suggests a link between vaping and ADHD symptoms, depression and feelings of stress. But experts say that the research is very limited and more work needs to be done.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there’s not even a clear scientific consensus that vaping is an effective way to quit smoking, with different studies coming up with different conclusions.</p>
<p>Clearing the Air</p>
<p>Last month, the World Health Organization raised alarms about the rapidly growing global markets for electronic cigarettes, noting they come in thousands of flavors that attract young people.</p>
<p>In 2016, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said efforts were needed to prevent and reduce e-cigarette use by children and young adults, saying nicotine in any form is unsafe for kids.</p>
<p>About four months before the report’s release, the FDA began taking steps to regulate e-cigarettes, believing they would benefit smokers.</p>
<p>The agency has authorized several e-cigarettes, but it has refused more than 1 million product marketing applications. Critics say the FDA has been unfair and inconsistent in regulation of products.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the number of different e-cigarette devices sold in the U.S. has boomed, due largely to disposables imported from China that come in fruit and candy flavors. But vaping by youths has recently been falling: Last year, 10% of high school students surveyed said they had used e-cigarettes in the previous month, down from 14% the year before.</p>
<p>Why the decline? “It’s hard to say what’s working,” said Steven Kelder, a University of Texas researcher.</p>
<p>He mentioned a 2019 outbreak of hospitalizations and deaths among people who were vaping products with THC, the chemical that gives marijuana its high.</p>
<p>The illnesses were traced to a thickening agent used in black market vape cartridges, a substance not used in commercial nicotine e-cigarettes. But it may be a reason many Americans think of e-cigarettes as unsafe, Kelder said.</p>
<p>Sherri Mayfield, a 47-year-old postal worker, remembers the 2019 outbreak and reports of rapid illnesses and deaths in youths. Vaping “absolutely” needs to be studied more, Mayfield said last week while on a cigarette break in New York with some co-workers.</p>
<p>“Cigarettes aren’t safe” but at least it can take them decades to destroy your health, she said.</p>
<p>The surgeon general’s office said in a statement that the 1964 report “catalyzed a 60-year movement to address the harmful effects of smoking” and suggested similar action was needed to address youth vaping.</p>
<p>Murthy’s website, however, currently lists neither vaping nor smoking as a priority issue.</p>

What does that momentum mean for the year ahead? And later, the tide may be turning against noncompete agreements.

<p class="drop-caps">
The news that <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/hertz-tesla-ev-selloff" target="_self">Hertz is selling off one-third</a> of its electric vehicle fleet after limited demand and costly repairs means U.S. consumers just got 20,000 more choices when shopping for a used EV. And with prices continuing to fall, now may be one of the best times to snag a pre-owned electric at a nice discount. But buyer beware.
</p>
<p>
Last year, used car prices finally began to slip after pandemic-induced supply issues. EVs led the way, with pre-owned models down 22% from the previous year, <a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/kbb-atp-august-2023/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to <em>Cox Automotive</em></a>. Tesla saw the biggest price drops, specifically with the average Model 3 going for 21% less than the year before. Hertz’s liquidation of its EVs is certainly going to help keep used prices in check, particularly in oversaturated markets.
</p>
<p>
“EV inventory is already far outpacing current consumer demand,” says Pat Ryan, Founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.copilotsearch.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CoPilot</a>, a AI-driven car shopping assistant. “Used EVs have a market days supply of 51, compared to 43 for used gas-powered cars and 44 for used hybrids.” And it’s even higher for new models.
</p>
<p>
Ryan suggests the reason for the glut comes down to a few issues: Early adopters and luxury buyers made the switch to electric a few years ago, limiting demand while also keeping a steady supply of pre-owned vehicles hitting the market. There’s also price, charging, and even a <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/electric-cars-partisanship-problem" target="_self">partisan divide</a>. And with traditional automakers like GM and Ford overproducing EVs relative to demand (newcomers like Tesla <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/are-ev-sales-really-slowing-data" target="_self">aren’t necessarily seeing similar problems</a>), there are a lot of new and used options to choose from.
</p>
<p>
But for EV shoppers that might be a “potential advantage,” says Ryan. “Now might be a good time to buy as some dealers will likely be hoping to make a deal in order to move inventory off their lots.”
</p>
<p>
What kind of deal is the real question. While <a href="https://www.hertzcarsales.com/certified/Tesla/2021-Tesla-Model+3-eb7434410a0e0a934207aa4589f1fcfc.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a $21,500 Tesla Model 3</a> may seem enticing, the same issues that plagued Hertz – including the high cost of repairs – should give some buyers pause.
</p>
<p>
“If someone did want to buy a car from Hertz, buyers should be aware that most rental companies fix their vehicles in-house,” says Tom McParland, the owner of <a href="https://automatchconsulting.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Automatch Consulting</a>. “And if the car was involved in an accident that history may never appear on a Carfax.”
</p>
<p>
While fleet vehicles are relatively well-maintained to ensure they’re on the road and making money, anyone that’s regularly rented a car knows the wear and tear is substantial. The high-tech systems that power modern EVs are one thing, but the most costly item – the battery – is where buyers have to be the most vigilant.
</p>
<p>
“The big issue with used EVs is that it is currently difficult to accurately ascertain what the remaining battery life is,” says McParland. Because of that, he says, “a lot of the higher-mile cars will end up wholesaled and picked up by those questionable used car lots with ‘guaranteed credit approval.’”

<p>
“Climate change is a hoax” is <em>soooo </em>2016. In recent years, Republicans have <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/2024-election-climate-trump" target="_self">gotten more savvy</a> in their attacks on climate change — and, by proxy, on <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/the-inflation-reduction-act-remains-astonishing" target="_self">the Inflation Reduction Act</a>, the landmark climate legislation passed in 2022. These days, it’s less the science of global warming that’s up for debate than the way we’re addressing it. Republicans are now fighting a multi-front battle against EVs, the energy transition, and climate science, on behalf of golden eagles and whales. And no one is leading the charge more obviously — <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/latest-polls/republican/primaries" target="_blank">or quantifiably</a> — than former president and current presidential candidate Donald Trump.<br/>
</p>
<p>
With <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/27/project-2025-dismantle-us-climate-policy-next-republican-president" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the climate agenda on the line</a>, Heatmap is keeping a running list of Trump’s climate-related statements on the campaign trail. We’ve looked at his rallies, his TV appearances, and his comments on social media and put together a list of Trump’s most frequent and glaringly inaccurate claims since he vacated the White House in January 2021.
</p>
<p>
While some of his musings (okay, fine, a lot of them) might be laughably absurd, others might be something you’ve kind of, sort of wondered about, yourself. To help you better separate fact from fiction, we’ve added context and explanation to each quote, along with a bottom-line determination as to the remark’s facticity.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, this list is a work in progress and will be regularly updated and added to in the coming months, so if you’re ever in doubt, know that you can find the answer somewhere in here. For ease of navigation, we’ve broken things down into sections:

<em>“You know they don’t call it global warming so much now, they call it climate change because it wasn’t working … Global warming wasn’t working when it was cooling.

<strong>Fact check: </strong>The term “climate change” was initially popularized by Republicans. In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/02/us/a-call-for-softer-greener-language.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2002 memo</a>, Republican pollster Frank Luntz urged President George W. Bush to drop the phrase “global warming” in favor of “climate change” since the former sounds more “frightening” and “has catastrophic communications attached to it,” while “climate change sounds a more controllable and less emotional challenge.”
</p>
<p>
That said, <strong>scientists generally prefer the term “climate change”</strong> for pretty much exactly the reason Trump highlighted here — because it encompasses phenomena caused by the increase in CO2 in our atmosphere that don’t manifest as warming, like ocean acidification. For the record: Global warming doesn’t mean that the weather will <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/east-west-flood-blizzard-storm" target="_self">never get cold</a>, just that it will get <em>less</em> cold on average, over time. In fact, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00498-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research</a> shows that the cold parts of the globe are warming much, much faster than the rest.

<p>
<strong>Fact check</strong><strong>: That’s … true, actually.</strong> “When the atmosphere warms, that means it can hold more water,” Matthew Rodell, the deputy director of Earth sciences for hydrosphere, biosphere, and geophysics at NASA, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/03/14/climate/extreme-weather-climate-change.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who has made an extensive study of extreme drought and deluges</a>, told me. That means there will be both more droughts <em>and </em>more rainfall, even though the two phenomena might appear at a glance to contradict each other.
</p>
<p>
“On the drought side of things, when the air is warmer, more water can evaporate — can be pulled out of the land and out of the plants, into the air, and then transported away,” Rodell explained. “So you have, basically, more water being net removed from an area.” But water in the air has to return to Earth, eventually, in the form of more — and often extreme — rainfall.
</p>
<p>
Shouldn’t those two extremes effectively balance each other out? As Rodell put it to me, “Floods and droughts are both catastrophes.” During a drought, crops die and wells go dry. And while extreme rainfall might refill an aquifer, “if it’s at the point of being extreme and there’s a flood, <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/libya-floods-storm-daniel-derna" target="_self">that’s not good, either</a>.” Think about Libya, where extended heavy rains in the summer of 2023 broke through dams and inundated towns, killing 4,300 people, displacing an estimated 44,800 more, and causing <a href="https://www.trtafrika.com/africa/libya-allocates-dollar446m-for-post-flood-repairs-14939356" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">over $60 million in damage</a>.
</p>
<p>
One last thing to mention here: While our ability to determine the precise contribution of climate change to individual extreme weather events is improving rapidly, that is, in some ways, beside the point. Rodell explained that “in terms of the frequency, and looking at all these events together and how they’ve changed over time, we’re seeing that they’re increasing in number and severity in correlation with global warming. That doesn’t mean you can say any particular event is 100% by global warming, but, I mean — statistically, it’s <em>extremely unlikely</em> that this is just a coincidence.”

<p>
<strong>Fact check: While it’s true that the climate has always changed, it hasn’t always changed like <em>this</em>.</strong> The rapid rise in both atmospheric carbon dioxide <em>and </em>observed average surface temperature since the Industrial Revolution can only be credited to humans, and specifically to the burning of fossil fuels, which release CO2, a heat-trapping gas. There is now near-universal<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> scientific consensus</a> that the warming we’re witnessing has been caused by human activity.
</p>
<p>
“The most popular climate myths are the ones that are simple and easy to say,” as John Cook, a senior research fellow at Melbourne University’s School of Psychological Sciences who’s made a <a href="https://youtu.be/JuUz2AwoSko?list=PL1xbdG-NAkB1fAyNAWErM4uEXyduldiew&t=750" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">specialty</a> of <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aaa49f" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">combatting</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/H5kejSYPD7U" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">climate disinformation</a>, told me. “It’s the single-cause fallacy, thinking that only one thing can cause natural causes. But you can have other things like human activity that also drive climate change,” Cook added.
</p>
<p>
Start digging into this kind of logic and it quickly falls apart. For example, Trump’s argument is that the climate has changed naturally in the past; therefore, it must be changing naturally now, as well. But, Cook told me, the same logic could also be used to argue, <em>People have died of cancer in the past; therefore, cigarettes don’t cause cancer now</em>.

<p>
<strong>Fact check:</strong> For starters, <strong>Trump’s numbers are orders of magnitude off the mark. </strong>The oceans are on track to rise <em>3.5 feet to 7 feet</em> along America’s coastlines by 2100 — well ahead of Trump’s schedule — according to <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/hazards/sealevelrise/sealevelrise-tech-report.html#:~:text=About%202%20feet%20(0.6%20meters,the%20end%20of%20this%20century." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an independent assessment</a> conducted by federal scientific agencies. Even if global carbon emissions had peaked in 2020 (<a href="https://www.iea.org/news/global-co2-emissions-rebounded-to-their-highest-level-in-history-in-2021https://www.iea.org/news/global-co2-emissions-rebounded-to-their-highest-level-in-history-in-2021" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">which we know they did not</a>) and declined relatively rapidly thereafter, the oceans would <em>still</em> probably rise more than 3 feet worldwide by 2300 compared to their 2000 levels, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-02985-8/tables/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">researchers have found,</a> because so much heat is already trapped in the climate system.
</p>
<p>
According to the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM_final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">latest scientific report</a> from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, “sea level rise greater than 15 meters,” or 49 feet, by the year 2300 “cannot be ruled out” in a high-emissions scenario.
</p>
<p>
While unlikely, 49 feet of sea-level rise would be catastrophic. Large swaths of lower Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens would be completely submerged, with waves lapping at the walls of Yankee Stadium and Citi Field. The southern half of Florida would vanish (bye-bye, Mar-a-Lago!). Countries like the Netherlands and Bangladesh would, literally, disappear from the map.
</p>
<p>
As for that supposedly new oceanfront property Trump is so excited about, scientists expect some <a href="https://www.foxweather.com/extreme-weather/study-rising-sea-levels-flood-nearly-650000-oceanfront-properties-us-by-2050" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">650,000 beachfront properties</a> to flood due to sea level rise in the United States by 2050 — not to mention that globally, some <em>230 million people</em> <a href="https://urbanoceanlab.org/sea-level-rise" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">live within 3 feet</a> of current high-tide lines.

<strong>Fact check:</strong> The U.S. will not “under any circumstances” pay climate reparations to developing nations, climate envoy John Kerry <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66197366" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vowed</a> in front of Congress last year. The situation is, however — and unsurprisingly — more <strong>complicated</strong> than that.
</p>
<p>
At COP28 last year, the U.S. pledged $17.5 million to the U.N.’s “loss and damage” fund, which is intended to help developing countries recover from future climate disasters. While some outlets — including <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/cop28-loss-damage-reparations-fund" target="_self">this publication</a> — have <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/12/2/reparations-fund-historic-but-real-fight-begins-now-climate-campaigners" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">characterized</a> this fund as “reparations,” the fund has more in common with <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/a-hilariously-sad-chart-of-cop28-climate-pledges" target="_self">other international pledges</a> directed at helping developing countries than calls for climate reparations that hold historic polluters morally and financially responsible.

<p>
<strong>Fact check:</strong> China, India, and Russia are all Paris Agreement signatories. But even if they truly didn’t “partake” at all in international climate mitigation efforts, <strong>that hardly means the U.S. shouldn’t try to be cleaner</strong>.
</p>
<p>
But let’s take Trump at face value here. When asked to assess if the Paris Agreement gives an unfair advantage to nations like China and India, law professor Daniel Bodansky at the Arizona State University College of Law pointed out <a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/politics/politifact/2021/01/27/fact-check-paris-climate-agreement-easier-china-india-than-united-states/4276557001/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to <em>USA Today</em></a> that “the United States is the second biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world and has higher per capita emissions than either China or India. It is misleading to point the finger at China and India and label them as the real polluters.”
</p>
<p>
What about the bad air flowing to us “from Asia,” then? This isn’t total nonsense. For one thing, we <em>do</em> all share the same atmosphere; that’s kind of the whole point of the global movement to stop climate change. But more concretely, yes, researchers have found that pollutants from China can make their way to the Western U.S.
</p>
<p>
Here’s where it gets awkward: “An estimated 36% of manmade sulfur dioxide, 27% of nitrogen oxide, 22% of carbon monoxide, and 17% of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_carbon" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">black carbon</a> over China are the result of manufacturing goods for export. About a fifth of each of these was associated with products exported to the U.S. in particular,” <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/air-pollution-china-is-spreading-across-pacific-us-180949395/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Scientific American</em> writes</a>. In other words, a lot of that “bad air” flowing to us from Asia that Trump is complaining about is from manufacturing products for <em>Americans</em>.

<p>
<strong>Fact check:</strong> If you ever want to feel ridiculous, try asking a scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration if windmills are making whales “a little batty.”
</p>
<p>
NOAA actively studies how “sound, vessel, and other human activities” impact marine life, Lauren Gaches, the director of NOAA Fisheries Public Affairs, told me over email. “At this point, <strong>there is no scientific evidence that noise resulting from offshore wind site characterization surveys could potentially cause mortality of whales</strong>,” she said.
</p>
<p>
An ongoing “unusual mortality event” for humpback whales has resulted in 200 whale deaths between 2016 and June 2023 along the Atlantic coast from Maine to Florida — that much is true. But “there are no known links between recent large whale mortalities and ongoing offshore wind surveys,” Gaches told me. <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/marine-life-distress/frequent-questions-offshore-wind-and-whales" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NOAA’s fact page</a> on whales and offshore wind explains that of “roughly 90 whales examined, about 40% had evidence of human interaction, either ship strike or entanglement.”
</p>
<p>
There has been some chatter about underwater surveying work disrupting whales, which <a href="https://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/mar/mcbem-2014-01/other/mcbem-2014-01-submission-seismic-airgun-en.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">may be true</a> in the case of oil and gas surveys, which use seismic air guns to penetrate deep into the ocean floor. The surveying equipment used for offshore wind is, by contrast, used in 15-second bursts and limited to a specific area, “so the likelihood of an animal encountering and coming right into that sound beam is quite low,” Erica Staaterman, the deputy director for the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s Center for Marine Acoustics, said on <a href="https://noaa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/Transcript-011823-NOAA-Fisheries-Media-Teleconference-East-Coast-whale-strandings-508.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a NOAA-hosted call with the press</a> early last year.
</p>
<p>
As Ben Laws, the deputy chief of NOAA’s Permits and Conservation Division in the Office of Protected Resources, said on the same call, “There is no information that would support any suggestion that any of the equipment that’s being used in support of wind development for these site characterization surveys could directly lead to the death of a whale.”

<strong>Fact check:</strong> Trump has had a vendetta against wind turbines since <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/201032113686974464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E201032113686974464%7Ctwgr%5E6ad5e98bc0b4151341e73bac3045d6bae8fea167%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetrumparchive.com%2F%3Fsearchbox%3D22wind22results%3D1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">long before</a> he ever ran for president. “Wind farms are killing many thousands of birds,” reads one illustrative tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/236213559191805953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E236213559191805953%7Ctwgr%5E6ad5e98bc0b4151341e73bac3045d6bae8fea167%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetrumparchive.com%2F%3Fsearchbox%3D22wind22results%3D1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from 2012</a>. “They make hunters look like nice people!”
</p>
<p>
Lewis Grove is the director of wind and energy policy at the American Bird Conservancy, and he told me that while it’s “not necessarily as simple as Mr. Trump painted it out to be, <strong>wind turbines absolutely kill birds</strong>.”
</p>
<p>
But the context here is extremely important. Jason Ryan, a spokesperson for the American Clean Power Association, a leading renewable energy trade group, pointed me to research from the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service that shows wind farms “represent just <a href="https://www.fws.gov/library/collections/threats-birds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">0.03% of all human-related bird deaths in the U.S.</a>” Grove likewise told me that, for the most part, bird deaths due to wind turbines do “not have population-level impacts.”
</p>
<p>
There are exceptions, such as an infamous wind farm in California’s Altamont Pass built in 1981 that “just happened to be in a place that was really heavily used by golden eagles,” Grove told me. Because golden eagle populations were already very low, having <a href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/protecting_birds_of_prey_at_altamont_pass/pdfs/factsheet.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">100 or so</a> killed a year by turbines was “unsustainable.” Even in a case like this, though, it behooves one to look at the whole picture: “They found it was a few individual turbines that were causing the damage,” Grove said. These days, around 60 golden eagles a year are killed in Alameda County, <a href="https://alamedapost.com/features/alameda-life/making-wind-energy-safer-for-golden-eagles/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the<em> Alameda Post</em> reports</a>, and the operating company must pay steep penalties for eagle deaths.
</p>
<p>
What’s more, “climate change is one of the greatest threats birds face, with <a href="https://www.audubon.org/climate/survivalbydegrees" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two-thirds of North American species</a> at risk of extinction due to our warming planet,” Jon Belak, senior manager of science and data analysis at The National Audubon Society, told me in a statement. “We need to build more wind and solar facilities to help slow the rise in global temperatures and protect birds and their habitats from a changing climate.”
</p>
<p>
Wind farms may not have population-level impacts on birds, but fracking does — “the onset of shale oil and gas production reduces subsequent bird population counts by 15%,” even after accounting for factors like weather and other land-use changes, according to one just-published, peer-reviewed study.
</p>

I want to watch him on television tonight.’ ‘I’m sorry, but the wind isn’t blowing, you’ll have to wait ‘til another time.’ Windmills.”</em> [<a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1507924183619194880?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">March 26, 2022</a>]

<p>
<strong>Fact check:</strong> “I mean, <strong>it’s possible with any mix of generation that if supply and demand aren’t equal, your TV will go out</strong>. That’s just physics,” Kyri Baker, an assistant professor of engineering at the University of Colorado, told me when I asked her if Trump’s scenario had any merit. In other words, a power outage could happen whether your electricity is coming from coal or natural gas or anything else. The difference, she said, is that “wind is by nature variable, intermittent. But it’s also not reliant on fuel like natural gas or coal plants or even nuclear plants are.”
</p>
<p>
What happens on days when there is no wind? “Grids are extremely regulated,” Baker explained to me. “There’s so many layers of redundancy that aim <em>specifically</em> to not have [an outage] happen.” A grid is made up of diverse electricity sources (for my visual learners, <em>Canary</em> imagines what a net-zero grid could look like <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/chart-what-will-a-net-zero-grid-energy-mix-actually-look-like" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>), as well as measures like offline backup generators, which can kick in if need be, so service isn’t disrupted.
</p>

<p>
But maybe Trump meant atmosphere as in “sense of place”? Most Americans don’t seem to think windmills are “ruining” anything. In <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/change-polling-concern-belief-republicans-vs-democrats" target="_self">a recent Heatmap poll</a>, nearly eight in 10 Americans said they want the government to make it <em>easier</em> to build new wind farms. <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2023/10/03/solar-panels-wind-turbines-nimby/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">similarly found last year</a> that about 70% of Americans said they wouldn’t mind living near a wind farm.
</p>
<p>
As my colleague Robinson Meyer <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/renewables-nimby-poll-solar-wind" target="_self">has written</a>, “American laws today give even a small, well-resourced minority plenty of tools to block a project” like a wind farm, and “what’s more, once that small group starts campaigning against a project, the public’s broad but shallow support for, say, a general technology can crater. That’s what happened recently in New Jersey, where a once broadly pro-wind public <a href="https://stockton.edu/news/2023/windmill-support-drops-hughes-poll.html#:~:text=In%202019%2C%2080%25%20of%20adult,today%20by%20the%20William%20J." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has turned against</a> four proposed offshore wind farms.”

<strong>Fact check: Wind in general is not the most expensive form of energy, but <em>offshore</em> wind is very expensive — for now.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Of the energy sources we’re currently used to, nuclear is usually cited as having the highest levelized cost of electricity — that is, it has the highest average cost per unit of electricity generated after construction, maintenance, and operation have been taken into account. Peaker plants — gas-powered plants that run just during times of peak demand — usually come in second.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://decarbonization.visualcapitalist.com/the-cheapest-sources-of-electricity-in-the-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Offshore wind <em>is </em>costly</a>, with the levelized cost of electricity from a subsidized U.S. offshore wind project increasing “to $114.20 per megawatt-hour in 2023, up almost 50% from 2021 levels in nominal terms,” <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/soaring-costs-stress-us-offshore-wind-companies-ruin-margins/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BloombergNEF reports</a>. Many of the factors making offshore wind so expensive — including <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/permitting-reform-transmission-nepa-geothermal" target="_self">permitting delays</a>, <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/high-interest-rates-clean-energy" target="_self">high interest rates</a>, and <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/everyones-mad-at-offshore-wind-developers" target="_self">supply chain issues</a> — will abate with time. Meanwhile, onshore wind is one of the <em>cheapest</em> forms of electricity available and has boasted a “lower LCOE than gas plants since 2015,” Sustainable Energy in America <a href="https://decarbonization.visualcapitalist.com/the-cheapest-sources-of-electricity-in-the-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a>.

<p>
<strong>Fact check:</strong> “That question is actually a little bit tricky,” Baker, the assistant professor of engineering at the University of Colorado, told me, when I asked him whether solar alone could power a factory — but <strong>it’s also not really what we should be asking</strong>. “One thing I’ve noticed people do a lot is they’ll just compare efficiency of power generation,” Baker explained. But “it’s not just about the efficiency — it’s about other things, too, like solar’s ability to be distributed. You can’t put a nuclear fission power plant in your house — you know, not yet — but you <em>can</em> put solar panels, so that’s a huge benefit. It offers some resiliency that other sources just can’t offer.”

<p>
It’s true that solar power <em>is</em> less efficient than other sources of energy, including wind, and that it requires a lot of surface area, which could be an undue burden for a manufacturer.

<strong>Fact check: It’s not wrong to say that Biden has tried to reduce the role of liquid fuel in vehicles.</strong> Trump has gunned for Iowa voters by claiming Biden’s goal (albeit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/28/us/politics/trump-fact-check-electric-vehicles.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not a binding mandate</a>) of ramping up EV sales will kill the local ethanol industry. But Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack — Iowa’s former governor — has stressed that just because the administration is pushing for more EVs, “Does that mean we won’t have a need for E15 or E85” — gasoline blends that contain up to 15% and 85% ethanol content, respectively — “in the future? No.”
</p>
<p>
For example, new rules defining what qualifies as a “sustainable aviation fuel” — and thus for generous tax credits under the IRA — include ethanol and other plant-based fuels, despite <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/us-sustainable-aviation-fuel-emissions-impacts" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opposition</a> from <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/looking-for-a-greener-way-to-fly" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">environmental groups</a>. “The Biden administration plans to invest $4.3 billion to support production of 35 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel annually by 2050,” presenting a significant opportunity for Iowa’s farmers, <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/agriculture/2021/09/12/bidens-electric-car-push-doom-ethanol-farmers-us-ag-secretary-says-no-carbon-emissions-corn/8201034002/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Des Moines Register</em> writes</a>.

<strong>Fact check:</strong> There’s a lot to unpack here, but the gist is that most of <strong>these are the kind of early-stage problems you would find with any emerging technology</strong>. While <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electric-vehicles/electric-big-rigs-are-going-farther-and-charging-faster" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the technology</a> powering heavy-duty electric trucks is promising, there is still a long way to go when it comes to range and capacity.
</p>
<p>
Still, even a semi that goes only around 375 miles — longer than Trump’s estimate — on a single charge would ultimately be cheaper than a diesel truck, <a href="https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-the-future-of-the-trucking-industry-electric-semi-trucks-2023#:~:text=Benefits%20of%20Electric%20Semi%2DTrucks,-Improved%20Health%20and&text=Lower%20Total%20Cost%20of%20Ownership,drivetrain%20also%20reduces%20maintenance%20costs." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one 2021 study found</a>. Because of the lower cost of ownership, electric semis have a net savings of $200,000 over a 15-year lifespan.

Battery size, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/electric-trucks-longhaul-batteries-tesla-heavy-cargo-weight-problem-2023-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in particular battery <em>weight</em></a>, will be a major hurdle for long haul electric semis; shipping rates are often determined based on weight, among other factors, and since freight companies already operate on narrow margins, carrying less freight weight is a problem.

<p>
<strong>Fact check:</strong> Trump has repeatedly slammed the Biden administration for supposedly wanting to switch to “all-electric” tanks. <strong>This is mostly false</strong>, though it has its roots in the Army’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2022/02/10/army-military-green-climate-strategy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first-ever climate strategy</a>, released early last year. In it, the Army stated that it aims to electrify all noncombat vehicles by 2035 and some tactical vehicles by 2050.
</p>
<p>
The reason the Army wants to go electric isn’t because of some woke environmentalist agenda, though. “The primary reason the Army wants to electrify its fighting vehicles is to reduce wartime casualties,” <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/us-armys-electric-tanks-on-hold-as-battery-technology-develops" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Bloomberg</em> writes</a>. “An all-electric fleet would mean personnel wouldn’t have to go on dangerous refueling missions that draw combat forces away from fighting the enemy … [and] electric vehicles are also much quieter and harder to spot on enemy surveillance systems because they generate so little heat.”
</p>
<p>
Trump has also slammed the Air Force for <a href="https://www.safie.hq.af.mil/Programs/Climate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its climate action plan</a>, although the roots of his claim that Biden wants to make jet fighters green by “losing 15% efficiency” are much less clear. He may be referring to the Air Force’s <a href="https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2819999/the-air-force-partners-with-twelve-proves-its-possible-to-make-jet-fuel-out-of/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exploration of alternative fuels</a> — which again, it is doing primarily for strategic reasons, since the Air Force reports 30% of the casualties in Afghanistan came from attacks on fuel and water convoys. “We’re not doing the climate plan for climate’s sake … Everything is about increasing our combat capability,” Edwin Oshiba, assistant secretary of the Air Force for energy, installations, and the environment, <a href="https://www.afcea.org/signal-media/efficiency-fuels-air-force-climate-change-plan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association.

<strong>Fact check:</strong> Trump made this comment while discussing electric catapults and magnetic elevators on aircraft carriers.

<p>
<strong>Fact check:</strong> As someone who lives in a New York City apartment, I would absolutely describe my dishwasher as “precious and dear,” so that part is true. It is also true that, <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/dishwashers-biden-conservatives-culture-war" target="_self">as I explained last year</a>, rules proposed by the Biden administration call for new dishwashers imported and made in the U.S. to use 34% less water, or no more than 3.3 gallons, during their default cycles by 2027. But <strong>it is not true that those dishwashers don’t work</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Energy-efficient dishwashers <em>can </em>take a long time to clean your dishes; many cycles last more than two hours and some up to three. The reason for this is pretty straightforward: In order to achieve the same level of cleanliness as old, water- and energy-inefficient dishwashers, new water- and energy-efficient dishwashers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyOHcNcovYA&ab_channel=ApplianceVideo.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">need to swish around longer</a>.
</p>
<p>
But the “default cycles” are the <em>only</em> dishwasher mode the government restricts; “short cycle” modes, which require more water and take less time, are still allowed on dishwashers sold in the U.S. and aren’t regulated by the new rules. That fast mode just can’t be the default. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/dishwashers-trump-efficiency/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">As <em>Wirecutter</em> writes</a>, “crappy cleaning performance and long cycles aren’t an inevitable outcome of efficiency standards,” and “if your dishwasher is slow and sucks (and a better detergent doesn’t fix the problem), blame the company that built it.”

<strong>Fact check: It’s really gas furnace systems that are, technically speaking, dated.</strong> Gas furnaces were considered <a href="https://cycleairfilters.com/blogs/all-about-hvac/history-of-the-forced-air-gas-furnace#:~:text=In%20the%201920s%20and%201930s,for%20their%20efficiency%20and%20reliability." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state-of-the-art</a> in the 1920s and 1930s, while heat pump technology — which works by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQaycSD5GWE&ab_channel=BCHydro" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">transferring</a>, rather than generating, heat from indoors to outdoors and vice versa — <a href="https://texascooppower.com/heat-pumps-are-back-and-worth-a-look/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">took off in the 1970s</a> as a response to surging oil prices. Heat pumps can be up to five times more efficient than fossil-fuel furnaces, according to electrification advocacy group Rewiring America, which means that at least 70% of people could save money on their energy bills by switching from fossil fuel heaters, the group estimates.
</p>
<p>
The cost of a heat pump itself <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/reviews/hvac/heat-pump-cost" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">varies widely</a> depending on size (how much house it has to heat), type (geothermal vs. air source), and efficiency, then when you add in factors like the cost to refit you existing HVAC system and the cost of labor, well, <a href="https://www.blocpower.io/posts/heat-pump-installation-cost-2023-prices-guide" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it adds up</a>. While heat pumps aren’t cheap, they do at least serve as both a furnace <em>and</em> an air conditioner, two appliances for the price of one, an investment that can pay back over time, Rewiring America said.

<h2 id="arctic-freeze-blasts-huge-swaths-of-us-with-sub-zero-temperatures">Arctic Freeze Blasts Huge Swaths of US with Sub-zero Temperatures</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PORTLAND, Ore. — A dangerous Arctic blast will continue sweeping across the U.S. on Monday and linger through at least midweek, prolonging a bitter cold that set record-low temperatures in parts of the country and threatens to further disrupt daily life, including an NFL playoff game and the first-in-the-nation presidential nominating contest in Iowa.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service said wind chills are expected to push temperatures 34 degrees below zero Celsius from the Northern Rockies to northern Kansas and into Iowa, testing the hardiness of caucus-goers willing to brave the deep chill on Monday.</p>
<p>“You can’t sit home,” former President Donald Trump told supporters Sunday. “If you’re sick as a dog, you say, ‘Darling, I gotta make it.’ Even if you vote and then pass away, it’s worth it.”</p>
<p>Arctic storms left at least four dead and knocked out electricity to tens of thousands in the Northwest, brought snow to the South and walloped the Northeast with blizzard conditions forcing the postponement of the Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Buffalo Bills NFL playoff game hosted in bone-chilling Buffalo, New York.</p>
<p>The game was scheduled to be held Monday after being canceled Sunday.</p>
<p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Buffalo native, posted a video on X, formerly known as Twitter, showing near-whiteout conditions.</p>
<p>“Conditions right now in Orchard Park, where the game would have started moments ago,” she wrote early Sunday afternoon. “No visibility and dangerously high winds.”</p>
<p>The Bills invited diehard fans to help dig out snow-filled Highmark Stadium, offering $20 an hour for their labor.</p>
<p>“We made progress shoveling, but not much at all,” said Logan Eschrich, a storm chaser who made his way to Buffalo and pitched in.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if the show will go on Monday afternoon. The weather service expects heavy lake-effect snow to push into upstate New York from Lake Erie, adding to the 30.4 to 60.9 centimeters of snow already blanketing the region. Snow fell at a rate of 5 centimeters per hour.</p>
<p>Sub-zero wind chills will grip much of the country, plunging to –45 degrees Celsius in Montana and the Dakotas.</p>
<p>“It takes a matter of minutes for frostbite to set in,” the South Dakota Department of Public Safety said in a statement Sunday urging people to stay indoors.</p>
<p>Other parts of the country could see temperatures drop 25 to 40 degrees below normal, from the Rockies to the Ohio Valley.</p>
<p>As temperatures in Texas plunged, the state’s power grid operator appealed to residents to voluntarily conserve electricity Monday morning due to the cold weather causing “record breaking demand” for energy.</p>
<p>A deadly freeze in 2021 left millions of Texans without power but state officials this week expressed confidence about the grid’s reliability as the cold front approached.</p>
<p>Freezing rain is expected to pelt parts of the Southern Plains and Southern Appalachians.</p>
<p>Even places like Florida won’t be spared from turbulent weather, with forecasts predicting showers and thunderstorms from Monday into Tuesday.</p>
<p>In Oregon, more than 120,000 homes and businesses were without electricity, most of them in the Portland metro area, a day after high winds and a mix of snow and ice brought down trees and power lines.</p>
<p>Some 100 trees toppled over the weekend in a community just south of Portland, including one that fell on a house and killed a man. Two other people died of suspected hypothermia and a fourth died in a fire that spread from an open-flame stove after a tree fell onto an RV.</p>
<p>“Given the extent of the damage and the high level of outage events, restoration efforts will continue into the week and customers are encouraged to plan accordingly,” Portland General Electric said in a statement. The utility said it was watching a second weather pattern that could bring high winds and freezing rain on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Widespread power outages affecting tens of thousands were also reported Sunday in Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In Nebraska, the Omaha Public Power District asked customers to conserve electricity to prevent outages.</p>
<p>Airports across the country were impacted. More than half of flights into and out of Buffalo Niagara International Airport were canceled. Scores of flights also were canceled or delayed at Chicago, Denver and Seattle-Tacoma airports.</p>

<h2 id="deaths-in-rio-grande-intensify-tensions-between-texas-biden-administration">Deaths in Rio Grande Intensify Tensions Between Texas, Biden Administration</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BROWNSVILLE, Texas — After Texas fenced off a park along the U.S.-Mexico border and began turning away Border Patrol agents, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott explained why at a campaign stop near Houston.</p>
<p>“We are not allowing Border Patrol on that property anymore,” Abbott said Friday, drawing applause from supporters while endorsing a state legislator running for reelection. He relayed frustration over migrants illegally entering the U.S. through the border city of Eagle Pass and federal agents loading them onto buses.</p>
<p>“We said, ‘We’ve had it. We’re not going to let this happen anymore,’” Abbott said.</p>
<p>Later that night, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said three migrants, including two children, drowned near the park after Texas officials “physically barred” Border Patrol agents from entering. Mexican authorities pulled the bodies, each of them wearing jackets, from the water on the other side of the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>The weekend deaths intensified tensions between Texas and the Biden administration. </p>
<p>They also unleashed a new round of criticism from Democrats over Abbott’s aggressive actions to curb illegal crossings, accusing the measures of putting migrants at risk. U.S. authorities described the drownings as underscoring the need for Border Patrol agents to have access to the area around Shelby Park, which Texas closed off earlier this week.</p>
<p>“U.S. Border Patrol must have access to the border to enforce our laws,” White House spokesman Angelo Fernández Hernández said in a statement.</p>
<p>On Sunday evening, the Texas Military Department released a statement disputing the U.S. government’s accounts, calling it “wholly inaccurate” that state personnel prevented Border Patrol from saving drowning migrants.</p>
<p>“At the time that Border Patrol requested access, the drownings had occurred, Mexican authorities were recovering the bodies, and Border Patrol expressed these facts to the TMD personnel on site,” the department said.</p>
<p>The Biden administration stuck to its initial account Sunday, saying in a letter to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton that Texas denied Border Patrol agents access before they knew the migrants died. In a direct contradiction of Texas’ version of events, Homeland Security said agents at the time knew only that migrants were attempting to cross the river.</p>
<p>“Texas has demonstrated that even in the most exigent circumstances, it will not allow Border Patrol agents access to the border to conduct law enforcement and emergency response activities,” wrote Jonathan E. Meyer, Homeland Security’s general counsel.</p>
<p>Meyer threatened legal action if Texas doesn’t restore access by the end of Wednesday.</p>
<p>The park lies in a major corridor for migrants entering illegally from Mexico and is at the center of Abbott’s aggressive attempts to stop them, known as Operation Lone Star. Migrants are periodically swept away to their deaths by the current of the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Democrat who represents a Texas border district, acknowledged Sunday that state officials investigated the distress call and searched for the migrants.</p>
<p>“However, the bottom line is that Border Patrol was barred from entering Shelby Park,” Cuellar said in a statement.</p>
<p>Texas officials said Border Patrol agents had requested access to find other migrants who were presumed to have been with those who died. Two were apprehended by state military personnel, including one who was transferred to medics with “hypothermic conditions.” The statement did not say whether Border Patrol agents were allowed in the park.</p>
<p>Over the summer, thousands of people were crossing illegally into the U.S. through Eagle Pass. The numbers subsided but again rose in December when thousands of migrants overwhelmed federal resources. But a sharp decrease was noted at the start of January after Mexico stepped up immigration enforcement.</p>
<p>The 20-hectare park is owned by the city, but it is used by the state Department of Public Safety and the Texas Military Department to patrol border crossings. Earlier this week, Eagle Pass Mayor Rolando Salinas questioned why the state closed the park now, since daily apprehensions in the region have fallen in recent weeks. He said the state gave city officials no warning and offered no timetable on when the park would reopen.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Justice Department told the U.S. Supreme Court that Texas had taken control of Shelby Park and was not letting Border Patrol agents enter. Texas acknowledged seizing the city park but told the court the federal government had mischaracterized its actions and that it was trying to resolve any disputes over access.</p>
<p>Texas has come under recurring scrutiny over efforts to curb border crossings. Abbott has sent more than 100,000 migrants on buses to Democratic-led cities, even as frigid conditions set in during the winter. He also has strung up razor wire on the border and installed buoy barriers on the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>Melissa R. Cigarroa, a city council member in Laredo and member of the No Border Wall Coalition, was among those who attended a vigil Saturday at Shelby Park to mark the deaths of migrants who have died along the Rio Grande. She said attendees passed through a gate with armed National Guard members and that they could see law enforcement officers and vehicles gathered near the river.</p>
<p>She said that scene, coupled with the reason for the ceremony, left her thinking about “just how little people’s lives matter in these decisions.”</p>
<p>“People are dying, and we know now that deterrents mean nothing,” she said.</p>

<h2 id="us-congressional-leaders-unveil-bill-to-avert-shutdown">US Congressional Leaders Unveil Bill to Avert Shutdown</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Democratic and Republican leaders in the U.S. Congress Sunday unveiled a short-term spending bill that would avert a partial government shutdown and keep federal agencies operating into March.</p>
<p>The agreement aims to avert short-term chaos and buy more time to craft the complex spending legislation that funds government activity.</p>
<p>Government agencies that oversee transportation, housing, and other services are due to run out of funding by midnight on Friday and would have to scale back activity if new funding is not signed into law.</p>
<p>The Democratic-led Senate and Republican-controlled House of Representatives have been at odds over spending levels for months.</p>
<p>Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer agreed on the measure with Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries.</p>
<p>The legislation could run into difficulty in the House, where a faction of conservative Republicans have used disruptive tactics to press for lower spending levels.</p>
<p>Republicans control the chamber with a narrow 219-213 majority, leaving Johnson with little room for error. Some Republicans insist that any spending bills must also clamp down on the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>Current funding is due to expire this week for federal programs involving transportation, housing, agriculture, energy, veterans and military construction.</p>
<p>Funding for other parts of the government, including defense, will continue through Feb. 2.</p>
<p>The new spending bill would extend the deadline to March 1 for the first group and March 8 for the second. Schumer, the top Democrat in Congress, and Johnson, the top Republican, have agreed on a $1.59 trillion total for those bills.</p>
<p>That would give lawmakers more time to negotiate and pass the detailed spending legislation they should have passed before the start of the government’s fiscal year on Oct. 1, 2023.</p>
<p>The legislation covers roughly one-third of U.S. government spending, which amounted to $6.1 trillion in the last fiscal year.</p>
<p>The remaining two-thirds includes retirement and health benefits which do not need to be approved annually by Congress, as well as interest payments.</p>
<p>Johnson spent much of last week in meetings with hardliners and other segments of his Republican conference, raising speculation that he could seek to revise his agreement with Schumer. But the speaker ultimately stood by the deal.</p>
<p>The federal government came close to a partial shutdown last autumn, when hardline Republicans ousted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy for reaching a bipartisan stopgap spending deal with Schumer.</p>

<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog</p>
<p>You hear sometimes, now that we know the sordid details of the lives of some of our leading figures, that America has no heroes left. When I was writing a book about the Wounded Knee Massacre, where heroism was pretty thin on the ground, I gave that a lot of thought. And I came to believe that heroism is neither being perfect, nor doing something spectacular. In fact, it’s just the opposite: it’s regular, flawed human beings choosing to put others before themselves, even at great cost, even if no one will ever know, even as they realize the walls might be closing in around them.</p>

<h2 id="us-ambassador-to-kazakhstan-outlines-us-engagement-in-central-asia">US Ambassador to Kazakhstan Outlines US Engagement in Central Asia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. strategic interests in Central Asia boil down to stability and sovereignty, according to Washington’s top diplomat in Kazakhstan, an oil-rich republic sharing long borders with Russia and China. </p>
<p>With an eye on the ongoing Russian aggression against Ukraine, a fellow former Soviet republic, the countries in the region have adopted a hedging strategy, maintaining deep links to Moscow while also bolstering relations with the West.</p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador to Kazakhstan Daniel Rosenblum told the Caspian Policy Center gathering on Jan. 4, that the main goal of U.S. policy for Central Asia is to ensure that Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan “stand on their own, be fully sovereign and independent countries that can make their own choices about who to associate with, who to trade with, who to have relations with — without undue external pressure.” </p>
<p>Rosenblum pointed to the so-called C5+1 group, including the United States and the five republics, underlining its “value in acting as a group, integrating with one another, cooperating — that makes each of them stronger individually.” </p>
<p>A second focus for Washington is border security and counterterrorism, a third is boosting trade and investment, and a fourth is promoting human rights and the rule of law, he said.</p>
<p>Economic and political aspects</p>
<p>Kazakhstan is America’s top business partner in Central Asia, with $3 billion in bilateral trade in 2022 and an estimated 15% increase last year, plus $5 billion direct investment in 2023.</p>
<p>Despite holding regular talks on human rights, Rosenblum said Washington and Astana “do not see eye-to-eye” on the lack of meaningful political competition and the continuous arrests of critical voices.</p>
<p>The New York-based Human Rights Watch sites enduring concerns.</p>
<p>“Two years after large-scale anti-government protests rocked Kazakhstan in January 2022, few officials have been held accountable for their part in [the] disproportionate use of force against protesters, arbitrary arrests and imprisonment, and torture and ill-treatment of detainees,” HRW stated in its annual report issued this week.</p>
<p>“When I arrived in November 2022, there were seven names on the list [of political prisoners], which had been going down steadily. And now there are 23, which is not a good trend,” Rosenblum said.</p>
<p>Akbota Karibayeva, a Ph.D. candidate at the George Washington University, agreed with Rosenblum, stressing that President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev’s transformation package branded as the “New Kazakhstan” has not yet had major effects.</p>
<p>“In the ‘New Kazakhstan,’ we continue to see a familiar cycle of detaining activists for expressing their opinions and repeatedly denying registration to opposition movements. The space for dissenting voices has barely expanded, if at all,” Karibayeva told VOA. </p>
<p>Asserting that Astana is complying with sanctions against Russia, Rosenblum pointed to the U.S., EU and U.K. comprised list of 45 categories of goods.</p>
<p>“Those 45, our experts say, are less than 2% of Kazakhstan’s exports to Russia. Even if they weren’t controlling it at all, it would not constitute more than 2%,” he said.</p>
<p>Rosenblum defended Kazakhstan, which has a 7,644-kilometer border with Russia.</p>
<p>“Since the sanctions were first imposed back in 2022, Kazakhstan’s record, I’d argue, is a good one, both in terms of their ability to prevent sanctions evasion and also making sure that they’re complying with all the sanctions when it comes to their domestic companies, relationships with Russian companies, Russian banks, and so on,” he said.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan last month removed the Taliban from its list of terrorist groups. </p>
<p>“They gave us advance notice that they were doing this, which is in the spirit of the partnership of no surprises,” Rosenblum said. “Kazakhstan has made clear that it will not recognize the Taliban government, and that remains its position until there’s an international consensus and certain benchmarks are made. And this doesn’t change that. They’ve also made clear that they prioritize developing some level of economic relations with Afghanistan, even with the Taliban regime in charge there.”</p>
<p>Kazakhstan vs. Uzbekistan</p>
<p>Before his current assignment, Rosenblum served as ambassador to Uzbekistan, whose leadership has also promised reforms. </p>
<p>“When I arrived in Tashkent [in 2019], it was already a couple of years into the reform process. … Things were slowing down,” he said.</p>
<p>In Rosenblum’s view, Uzbekistan’s initial steps toward change were dramatic, despite the backslidings many observe now, specifically the systemic challenges, testing President Shavkat Mirziyoyev’s commitment and his regime’s willingness to transition from an ingrained authoritarian government to a democratic one. </p>
<p>Kazakhstan, he said, has cycled through reform phases producing limited advances, “as opposed to what was really like a sea change, kind of a watershed in Uzbekistan, where suddenly the closed system was opened up.” </p>
<p>Since 2022, following the January civil unrest that left at least 227 dead, Kazakhstan changed its constitution, held presidential and parliamentary elections that Tokayev coined as “democratic” despite the lack of opposition. He has vowed to leave office in 2029, at the end of his seven-year presidential term. </p>
<p>Tokayev pledged to decentralize power and strengthen local governance, moves that Rosenblum said are still unfolding.</p>
<p>“The jury is still out. We have to give some time to see,” he said.</p>
<p>China, Russia, Iran </p>
<p>One issue Washington and Astana disagree on is China’s treatment of Uyghurs, atrocities that the U.S. considers a genocide and crimes against humanity. Yet Rosenblum sees some daylight there.</p>
<p>“There are some Uyghurs and ethnic Kazakhs who are able to cross the border. They don’t necessarily receive refugee status, but they’ve essentially taken refuge in Kazakhstan, which has lived up to its international obligations of nonrefoulement,” he said, referring to the principle that asylum-seekers should not be returned to countries where they face serious threat to life or freedom. </p>
<p>“They do not send people back to China,” he said. </p>
<p>Kazakhstan’s trade with China recently surpassed $30 billion, which is 10 times more than its trade with the United States, which Rosenblum said he does not find surprising “since they are close neighbors.”</p>
<p>“Kazakhs are sort of bullish on economic relations with China. They are not as exposed or as vulnerable, arguably, as other Central Asian countries because they haven’t taken on nearly as much Chinese debt,” he said.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan will continue to diversify its political and economic partnerships, Rosenblum predicted, despite China’s growing influence and the country’s continuing dependence on Russia for energy.</p>
<p>Russian nationalists’ frequent calls to annex Kazakhstan are viewed alarmingly in Astana, Rosenblum said, but he added, “I don’t feel like there’s a sense of any imminent danger or threat to the northern border of Kazakhstan.”</p>
<p>As part of the Moscow-led Eurasian Economic Union, Kazakhstan recently signed a free trade deal with Iran. Rosenblum said Astana consults with Washington on this issue as well. </p>
<p>“The Kazakh government by now has learned what’s sanctionable and what isn’t,” he said.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan, a regional leader?</p>
<p>While Rosenblum praised Kazakhstan as a “consistent pusher” for regional unity and connectivity, Karibayeva argued that to become a real catalyst for change in Central Asia, her country must lead by example.</p>
<p>“Symbolic gestures and high-level engagements among Central Asian countries and with the United States are important signals of commitment. But it is now essential to progress beyond discussions and focus on implementation at every level of cooperation,” she told VOA.</p>

<h2 id="following-review-business-insider-stands-by-reports-on-wife-of-ex-harvard-presidents-critic">Following Review, Business Insider Stands by Reports on Wife of Ex-Harvard President’s Critic</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Business Insider’s top executive and parent company said Sunday they were satisfied with the fairness and accuracy of stories that made plagiarism accusations against a former MIT professor who is married to a prominent critic of former Harvard President Claudine Gay.</p>
<p>“We stand by Business Insider and its newsroom,” said a spokesman for Axel Springer, the German media company that owns the publication.</p>
<p>The company had said it would look into the stories about Neri Oxman, a prominent designer, following complaints by her husband, Bill Ackman, a Harvard graduate and CEO of the Pershing Square investment firm. He publicly campaigned against Gay, who resigned earlier this month following criticism of her answers at a congressional hearing on antisemitism and charges that her academic writing contained examples of improperly credited work.</p>
<p>With its stories, Business Insider raised both the idea of hypocrisy and the possibility that academic dishonesty is widespread, even among the nation’s most prominent scholars.</p>
<p>Ackman’s response, and the pressure that a well-connected person placed on the corporate owners of a journalism outlet, raised questions about the outlet’s independence.</p>
<p>Business Insider and Axel Springer’s “liability just goes up and up and up,” Ackman said Sunday in a post on X, formerly Twitter. “This is what they consider fair, accurate and well-documented reporting with appropriate timing. Incredible.”</p>
<p>Business Insider’s first article, on Jan. 4, noted that Ackman had seized on revelations about Gay’s work to back his efforts against her — but that the organization’s journalists “found a similar pattern of plagiarism” by Oxman. A second piece, published the next day, said Oxman had stolen sentences and paragraphs from Wikipedia, fellow scholars and technical documents in a 2010 doctoral dissertation at M.I.T.</p>
<p>Ackman complained that it was a low blow to attack someone’s family in such a manner and said Business Insider reporters gave him less than two hours to respond to the accusations. He suggested an editor there was an anti-Zionist. Oxman was born in Israel.</p>
<p>The business leader reached out in protest to board members at both Business Insider and Axel Springer. That led to Axel Springer telling The New York Times that questions had been raised about the motivation behind the articles and the reporting process, and the company promised to conduct a review.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Business Insider CEO Barbara Peng issued a statement saying “there was no unfair bias or personal, political and/or religious motivation in pursuit of the story.”</p>
<p>Peng said the stories were newsworthy and that Oxman, with a public profile as a prominent intellectual, was fair game as a subject. The stories were “accurate and the facts well-documented,” Peng said.</p>
<p>“Business Insider supports and empowers our journalists to share newsworthy, factual stories with our readers, and we do so with editorial independence,” Peng wrote.</p>
<p>Business Insider would not say who conducted the review of its work.</p>
<p>Ackman said his wife admitted to four missing quotation marks and one missed footnote in a 330-page dissertation. He said the articles could have “literally killed” his wife if not for the support of her family and friends.</p>
<p>“She has suffered severe emotional harm,” he wrote on X, “and as an introvert, it has been very, very difficult for her to make it through each day.”</p>
<p>For her part, Gay wrote in the Times that those who campaigned to have her ousted “often trafficked in lies and ad hominem insults, not reasoned arguments.” Harvard’s first Black president said she was the subject of death threats and had “been called the N-word more times than I care to count.”</p>
<p>There was no immediate comment Sunday from Nicholas Carlson, Business Insider’s global editor in chief. In a memo to his staff last weekend that was reported by The Washington Post, Carlson said he made the call to publish both of the stories and that he knew the process of preparing them was sound.</p>

<h2 id="the-honeymooners-actress-joyce-randolph-dies-at-99">‘The Honeymooners’ Actress Joyce Randolph Dies At 99</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Joyce Randolph, a veteran stage and television actress whose role as the savvy Trixie Norton on “The Honeymooners” provided the perfect foil to her dimwitted TV husband, has died. She was 99.</p>
<p>Randolph died of natural causes Saturday night at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, her son Randolph Charles told The Associated Press Sunday.</p>
<p>She was the last surviving main character of the beloved comedy from television’s golden age of the 1950s.</p>
<p>“The Honeymooners” was an affectionate look at Brooklyn tenement life, based in part on star Jackie Gleason’s childhood. Gleason played the blustering bus driver Ralph Kramden. Audrey Meadows was his wisecracking, strong-willed wife Alice, and Art Carney the cheerful sewer worker Ed Norton. Alice and Trixie often found themselves commiserating over their husbands’ various follies and mishaps, whether unknowingly marketing dogfood as a popular snack or trying in vain to resist a rent hike, or freezing in the winter as their heat is shut off.</p>
<p>Randolph would later cite a handful of favorite episodes, including one in which Ed is sleepwalking.</p>
<p>“And Carney calls out, ‘Thelma?!’ He never knew his wife’s real name,” she later told the Television Academy Foundation.</p>
<p>Originating in 1950 as a recurring skit on Gleason’s variety show, “Cavalcade of Stars,” “The Honeymooners” still ranks among the all-time favorites of television comedy. The show grew in popularity after Gleason switched networks with “The Jackie Gleason Show.” Later, for one season in 1955-56, it became a full-fledged series.</p>
<p>Those 39 episodes became a staple of syndicated programming aired all over the country and beyond.</p>
<p>In an interview with The New York Times in January 2007, Randolph said she received no compensation in residuals for those 39 episodes. She said she finally began getting royalties with the discovery of “lost” episodes from the variety hours.</p>
<p>After five years as a member of Gleason’s on-the-air repertory company, Randolph virtually retired, opting to focus full-time on marriage and motherhood.</p>
<p>“I didn’t miss a thing by not working all the time,” she said. “I didn’t want a nanny raising (my) wonderful son.”</p>
<p>But decades after leaving the show, Randolph still had many admirers and received dozens of letters a week. She was a regular into her 80s at the downstairs bar at Sardi’s, where she liked to sip her favorite White Cadillac concoction — Dewar’s and milk — and chat with patrons who recognized her from a portrait of the sitcom’s four characters over the bar.</p>
<p>Randolph said the show’s impact on television viewers didn’t dawn on her until the early 1980s.</p>
<p>“One year while (my son) was in college at Yale, he came home and said, ‘Did you know that guys and girls come up to me and ask, ’Is your mom really Trixie?’” she told The San Antonio Express in 2000. “I guess he hadn’t paid much attention before then.”</p>
<p>Earlier, she had lamented that playing Trixie limited her career.</p>
<p>“For years after that role, directors would say: ‘No, we can’t use her. She’s too well-known as Trixie,’” Randolph told the Orlando Sentinel in 1993.</p>
<p>Gleason died in 1987 at age 71, followed by Meadows in 1996 and Carney in 2003. Gleason had revived “The Honeymooners” in the 1960s, with Jane Kean as Trixie.</p>
<p>Randolph was born Joyce Sirola in Detroit in 1924, and was around 19 when she joined a road company of “Stage Door.” From there she went to New York and performed in a number of Broadway shows.</p>
<p>In the late 1940s and early 1950s, she was seen often on TV, appearing with such stars as Eddie Cantor, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, Danny Thomas and Fred Allen.</p>
<p>Randolph met Gleason for the first time when she did a Clorets commercial on “Cavalcade of Stars,” and The Great One took a liking to her; she didn’t even have an agent at the time.</p>
<p>Randolph spent her retirement going to Broadway openings and fundraisers, being active with the U.S.O. and visiting other favorite Manhattan haunts, among them Angus, Chez Josephine and the Lambs Club.</p>
<p>Her husband, Richard Lincoln, a wealthy marketing executive who died in 1997, served as president at the Lambs, a theatrical club, and she reigned as “first lady.” They had one son, Charles.</p>

<h2 id="judge-says-trump-can-wait-a-week-to-testify-at-sex-abuse-victims-defamation-trial">Judge Says Trump Can Wait a Week to Testify at Sex Abuse Victim’s Defamation Trial</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Former President Donald Trump can wait a week to testify at a New York defamation trial where he could face millions of dollars in damages after a jury concluded that he sexually abused a columnist in the 1990s, a federal judge said Sunday.</p>
<p>Judge Lewis A. Kaplan issued a one-page order saying Trump could testify on Jan. 22 even if the trial that starts Tuesday is over by Thursday, except for testimony by the Republican front-runner in this year’s presidential race.</p>
<p>He said he previously denied Trump’s request to delay the start of the trial by a week so Trump could attend the funeral Thursday of his mother-in-law because it would disrupt and inconvenience prospective jurors, lawyers, court staff and security, who were notified of the trial date seven months ago.</p>
<p>The judge also noted that he has learned that Trump, even while seeking to postpone the trial, had scheduled an evening campaign appearance on Wednesday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. He said Trump’s lawyers notified the judge on Friday that Trump planned to attend the trial.</p>
<p>A jury to be chosen Tuesday prior to opening statements will hear evidence pertaining to $10 million in compensatory damages and millions more in punitive damages requested by attorneys for columnist E. Jean Carroll.</p>
<p>Carroll, 80, won a $5 million sex abuse and defamation judgment in May from a civil jury that heard her testify that Trump attacked her sexually in the dressing room of a luxury department store in midtown Manhattan in spring 1996 after they had a chance meeting that was lighthearted before turning violent.</p>
<p>Trump did not attend that trial and has repeatedly said he never knew Carroll and believed she made up her claims to promote a 2019 memoir in which she first made them publicly and to damage him politically.</p>
<p>The jury rejected Carroll’s claim that Trump raped her as rape is defined by New York state law but agreed that he sexually abused her in the department store and defamed her with statements he made in October 2022.</p>
<p>This month’s trial, long delayed by appeals, stems from defamatory comments the judge said Trump made about Carroll in 2019 and last May, a day after the jury announced its verdict.</p>
<p>Kaplan ruled last year that the trial starting Tuesday only will pertain to damages because the prior jury’s findings about sexual abuse and defamation can be accepted for purposes of the new trial.</p>
<p>Earlier on Sunday, Trump attorney Alina Habba objected to restrictions on Trump’s testimony requested by an attorney for Carroll, saying that despite instructions already given by the judge, Trump can “still offer considerable testimony in his defense.”</p>
<p>She noted that someone seeking punitive damages in a defamation case in New York state must show that libelous statements were made out of hatred, ill will or spite and said Trump should be allowed to offer evidence and testimony about whether hatred or ill will was behind his comments to reporters.</p>
<p>Habba said Trump also can testify about the circumstances of his comments and how they related to comments in Carroll’s “continuous parade of interviews and publicity.”</p>
<p>Carroll’s attorney, Roberta Kaplan, asked the judge in a letter on Friday to put restrictions on Trump if he testifies so that he does not “sow chaos” or “poison these proceedings.”</p>
<p>Kaplan, who is not related to the judge, said she feared Trump would try to flout the judge’s instructions that Trump not contend in his testimony, as he frequently has with public statements on the campaign trail, that Carroll fabricated her claims against him.</p>
<p>In a ruling earlier this month, the judge alluded to the fact that what the jury concluded Trump did to Carroll constitutes rape in some states when he wrote that “the fact that Mr. Trump sexually abused — indeed, raped — Ms. Carroll has been conclusively established and is binding in this case.”</p>

<h2 id="not-a-collector-but">Not a collector, but…</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
You might look at my office and the 32 plastic robot models on my shelf and think “This guy is a collector!” Or you might look a the bass guitar, electric guitar, long neck open back banjo, closed back resonator banjo, tuba, saxaphone, ukelele, and <em>shamisen</em> in my office and think, “Hey, this guy is a collector!” Or you might look at all the books, comics, or records in my office and think, “This guy knows how to collect!”
</p>
<p>
But you would be wrong.
</p>
<p>
I’m not a collector, I’m a serial project starter.
</p>
<p>
Each of those plastic models is the outcome of a project. You don’t look at a knitter’s socks and blankets and say “Wow, look at this yarn collector!” The same with the instruments; it’s not a collection of world instruments so much as evidence of an obsession for learning about objects that produce sound. The records? Well… most of those are from my step-father who –beyond tools he used for home improvement projects– wasn’t a collector either.
</p>
<p>
I know collectors with great collections. My uncle is an avid collector and his house is pretty much the town’s museum stuffed with old WW2 memorabilia. His collections also live at the local VA and the old train depot (which is now a museum). I admire people who collect, organize, catalog, and arrange. That archivist nature is a superskill.
</p>
<p>
Me? I suppose I have some inadvertent collections of similar objects, but I don’t fancy myself a collector. I don’t need more possessions in my life. But if there’s a project… well, don’t mind if I do.

<h2 id="on-enjoying-the-process">On enjoying the process</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
Working on a project of any kind is a journey. And like any type of journey, what matters the most is not the destination, but the journey itself. It’s easy for me to forget that crucial aspect while I’m working through any type of project. I jump from one project to the next, with my eyes set on the finish line but I forget to pay attention to the process. And in doing that I often find myself to be quite miserable. Because there’s no joy to be found at the finish line. The enjoyable part is the process. Trying new things, failing, making mistakes, experimenting, getting hurt. It’s all part of the process and it’s what makes the journey enjoyable.

<h2 id="howto-change-your-behavior">HOWTO: Change your behavior</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: Matt Might blog</p>
<p>
In theory, behavior change should be easy.
</p>
<p>
At first glance, it seems like <em>you</em> control your behavior.
</p>
<p>
So, if you desire different behavior, why doesn’t your behavior change as instantly as your desire to change it?
</p>
<p>
In short, lasting change of habitual behaviors is a multi-stage process.
</p>
<p>
In 1977, as psychologists James Prochaska and Carlo DiClemente were studying the behavior of smokers, they identified these stages.
</p>
<p>
Their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Changing-Good-Revolutionary-Overcoming-Positively/dp/038072572X?pd_rd_i=038072572X&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=mmamzn06-20&amp;linkId=10d08f55149cd797828a0557f1a1594b&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">transtheoretical model of behavior change</a> captures the process of behavior change in six different stages: (1) precontemplation; (2) contemplation; (3) preparation; (4) action; (5) maintenance; and (6) relapse.
</p>
<p><img src="images/dall-e-escher-ttm.png" class="abstract-image" /></p>
<center>
<em>DALL-E’s depiction of behavior change in the transtheoretical model.</em>
</center>
<p>
In the years since, this landmark model has been found to be applicable to many habitual human behaviors.
</p>
<p>
The key takeaway is that the odds of successful long-term behavior change improve if you calibrate your strategy to the stage of change you’re in.
</p>
<p>
The goal of this article is to provide an actionable summary of this model and interventions for each stage, so that you can more effectively change your behavior in the long-term.
</p>
<p>
Understanding the model may also help you to understand why you may have struggled with behavior change in the past.
</p>

</p>
<p>
At CES 2024, I had the opportunity to chat with Eben Upton, Raspberry Pi’s CEO. We discussed the future of AI on the Pi, RP2040’s successor, the impending launch of Compute Module 5, and current production rates of Pi 4 and Pi 5 computers—Raspberry Pi’s bread and butter.
</p>
<p>
The news is good: currently (as of last week), they are manufacturing Pi 5 at a rate of 70,000 per week. By the end of January? 90,000 per week.
</p>
<p>
That would put manufacturing capacity for Pi 5 alone at 400,000 units <em>every month</em>.

This year Lenovo plans to launch a laptop that lets you customize the colors and patterns on […]

Where we stand regarding the climate

<p>
This is a repost of <a href="https://mastodon.green/@peterdutoit/1117534198618423710">a thread</a> by <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.green/@peterdutoit" title="@peterdutoit@mastodon.green"><span class="citation" data-cites="peterdutoit">@peterdutoit</span></a>, with some additinal quotes from the sources linked. Peter du Toit has been posting climate related posts on fedi for quite a while. This is a recommendation to follow his account.

<p>
He says:
</p>
<p>
We are firmly on a path to chaos. We continue to pour greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Here is our track record for the period 1990-2022:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-01-14-climate-1.png" alt="Total green house gas emissions going from 38 GtCO₂ in 1990 to 57 GtCO₂ in 2022" />
</p>
<p>
Graph sourced from this report:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
All sectors apart from transport have fully rebounded from the drop in emissions induced by the COVID-19 pandemic and now exceed 2019 levels. CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes were the main contributors to the overall increase, accounting for about two thirds of current GHG emissions. Emissions of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and fluorinated gases (F-gases), which have higher global warming potentials and account for about one quarter of current GHG emissions, are increasing rapidly: in 2022, F-gas emissions grew by 5.5 per cent, followed by CH4 at 1.8 per cent and N2O at 0.9 per cent. – <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/43922/EGR2023.pdf">Broken Record: Temperatures hit new highs, yet world fails to cut emissions (again)</a>, by the UN environment programme.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As a result of the above, 2023 ended as the hottest year on record at +1.45°C above the preindustrial average, based on the six international climate datasets.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The annual average global temperature approached 1.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels – symbolic because the Paris Agreement on climate change aims to limit the long-term temperature increase (averaged over decades rather than an individual year like 2023) to no more than 1.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels. – <a href="https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/wmo-confirms-2023-smashes-global-temperature-record">WMO confirms that 2023 smashes global temperature record</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
At time of writing, using the standard decadal averages, we have currently heated by about +1.29ºC above the preindustrial average using four of the above datasets.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This number shows an up-to-the-second assessment of human-induced global warming since the second half of the 19th century. – <a href="https://www.globalwarmingindex.org/">Global Warming Index</a>

<p>
The consequences of a world that has heated by +1.3ºC has become very clear during the past year. Here is a month-by-month look at the extreme events of 2023.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The number of global extreme weather events has seen a “staggering rise” in the past 30 years, said the United Nations, and experts warn climate change is “supercharging” the problem, per The Associated Press. – <a href="https://theweek.com/in-depth/1021278/2023-extreme-weather">The extreme weather events of 2023</a>, by Devika Rao, for The Week US, behind a subscription wall
</p>

<p>
With the emission trajectory for both CO₂ and Methane still increasing, the earth will continue to heat. There is no negotiation with the physics of this.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
With our fossil fuel burning ways entrenched, we are firmly on track to pass the 1.5°C threshold in the near future.
</p>
<p>
Various groups have attempted to extrapolate when exactly this will become the earth’s permanent background baseline temperature.
</p>
<p>
Here is a projection from Berkley Earth:

<p>
Here is the projection from Copernicus Climate Change:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-01-14-climate-5.png" alt="Global warming reaches 1.5°C by November 2033" />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Global warming reached an estimated 1.26°C in December 2023. If the 30-year warming trend leading up then continued, global warming would reach 1.5°C by November 2033. – <a href="https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/software/app-c3s-global-temperature-trend-monitor">Global temperature trend monitor</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are others, like Dr James Hanson et al, who believe that these estimates are too conservative and that we will arrive at this threshold much sooner as they illustrate below.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-01-14-climate-6.png" alt="Global temperature will continue to grow in the next 5-8 months, carrying the 12-month running-mean to at least 1.6-1.7°C" />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We expect record monthly temperatures to continue into mid-2024 due to the present large planetary energy imbalance, with the 12- month running-mean global temperature reaching +1.6-1.7°C relative to 1880-1920 and falling to only +1.4 ± 0.1°C during the following La Nina. Considering the large planetary energy imbalance, it will be clear that the world is passing through the 1.5°C ceiling, and is headed much higher, unless steps are taken to affect Earth’s energy imbalance. – <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/2024/AnnualT2023.2024.01.12.pdf">Global Warming Acceleration: Causes and Consequences</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Whichever of the above projections end up being what transpires in reality, we know for sure that we are going to smash right past the 1.5°C threshold sometime between 2024 and 2033.
</p>
<p>
The devastation we witnessed in 2023 at +1.3°C of heating will seem mild as we reach higher levels of heating. We now also have solid research that shows crossing 1.5°C permanently, will set in motion tipping points that will unleash even more climate chaos as a result of their cascading effects.

<blockquote>
<p>
Climate system tipping elements are components of the Earth system susceptible to a tipping point, that is, a critical threshold beyond which the system reorganises, often abruptly and/or irreversibly. Improved scientific understanding has shown that triggering climate system tipping points already this century cannot be ruled out, far sooner and at lower levels of warming than previously assumed. The goal of this chapter is to review the state of knowledge of climate system tipping points. – <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/abc5a69e-en/1/3/2/index.html?itemId=/content/publication/abc5a69e-en&amp;_csp_=6d00888f3885b1fcadfb107c6ede4c51&amp;itemIGO=oecd&amp;itemContentType=book#">Climate Tipping Points: Insights for Effective Policy Action</a>, OECD iLibrary

Our current response to what the physics requires to slow the emissions freight train is nothing short of a joke. The current policies put us on track for a +2.7°C world. Talk about an overshoot!
</p>
<p>
The UNEP on what is required starting immediately:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To reach emission levels consistent with a below 2°C pathway in 2030, the cuts required per year are now 5.3 per cent from 2024, reaching 8.7 per cent per year on average for the 1.5°C pathway. To compare, the fall in total global GHG emissions from 2019 to 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic was 4.7 per cent. – <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/43922/EGR2023.pdf">Broken Record: Temperatures hit new highs, yet world fails to cut emissions (again)</a>, by the UN environment programme.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As we start 2024 there is NO indication that we have any intent to approach this with the same urgency and determination which was displayed during the Covid pandemic.
</p>
<p>
Look around, it’s all business as usual.
</p>
<p>
As as result we are, as the UN Secretary General put it, “on a highway to climate hell with our foot still on the accelerator.”
</p>
<p>
Right now, there are billions of people on the frontlines of this.
</p>
<p>
We are entering the period of climate induced chaos.

<h2 id="a-weekend-of-ferocious-winter-weather-could-see-low-temperature-records-set-in-us-heartland">A Weekend of Ferocious Winter Weather Could See Low-Temperature Records Set in US Heartland</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>O’FALLON, Mo. — Icy winter weather blanketed the U.S. on Saturday as a wave of Arctic storms threatened to break low-temperature records in the heartland, spread cold and snow from coast to coast and cast a chill over everything from football playoffs to presidential campaigns.</p>
<p>As the three-day Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday weekend began, the weather forecast was a crazy quilt of color-coded advisories, from an ice storm warning in Oregon to a blizzard warning in the northern Plains to high wind warnings in New Mexico.</p>
<p>“It’s, overall, been a terrible, terrible winter. And it came out of nowhere — two days,” Dan Abinana said as he surveyed a snowy Des Moines, Iowa. He moved to the state from Tanzania as a child years ago, but said “you never get used to the snow.”</p>
<p>The harsh weather in Oregon played a role in three deaths.</p>
<p>In Portland, medical examiners were investigating a hypothermia death as freezing rain and heavy snow fell in a city more accustomed to mild winter rains, and hundreds of people took shelter overnight at warming centers.</p>
<p>Portland Fire and Rescue also reported the death of a woman in her early 30s on Saturday afternoon. An RV caught fire when a small group of people used an open flame stove to keep warm inside and a tree fell on the vehicle, causing the fire to spread. Three other people escaped, including one with minor injuries, but the woman was trapped inside, the fire department said. </p>
<p>Authorities in Lake Oswego, Oregon, said a large tree fell on a home during high winds Saturday, killing an older man on the second floor.  </p>
<p>Weather-related deaths already were reported earlier in the week in California, Idaho, Illinois and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen announced a state of emergency, citing “very dangerous conditions.” Up to 2 feet (0.6 meters) of snow fell in some areas over the past week, and wind chills were well below zero.</p>
<p>“This event is not going away tonight. It’s not going away tomorrow,” Pillen said at a news conference “It’s going to take a number of days.”</p>
<p>About 1,700 miles (2,735 kilometers) of Nebraska highways were closed. State police assisted more than 400 stranded motorists, said Col. John A. Bolduc, head of the Nebraska State Patrol.</p>
<p>In Iowa, cars were stuck for five hours in blowing snow on Interstate 80 after semitrailers jackknifed in slippery conditions. State troopers had handled 86 crashes and 535 motorist-assist calls since Friday, State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla said.</p>
<p>Road crews were “working the snow-blowers like crazy,” Dinkla said, but high winds were blowing snow right back onto roadways.</p>
<p>Governors from New York to Louisiana warned residents to be prepared for worrisome weather.</p>
<p>Parts of Montana fell below minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 34 degrees Celsius) Saturday morning, and the National Weather Service said similar temperatures were expected as far as northern Kansas, with minus 50 F (minus 46 C) possible in the Dakotas. In St. Louis, the National Weather Service warned of rare and “life-threatening” cold.</p>
<p>“We’ve had, now, multiple back-to-back storms” parading across the country, weather service meteorologist Zach Taylor said. That typically happens at least a couple of times in the U.S. winter.</p>
<p>Still, to Eboni Jones of Des Moines, it felt unusual for “how much we’re getting all within one week.”</p>
<p>“It’s pretty crazy out,” Jones said while shoveling snow.</p>
<p>Grant Rampton, 25, also of Des Moines, braved a wind chill of minus 20 F (minus 29 C) to go sledding with friends at a golf course, fighting off the cold by wearing layers of clothing and insulated socks and keeping in constant movement.</p>
<p>“It’s a great state to be in,” said Rampton, a lifelong Iowan. “There’s not as much to do, in winter especially, but you can make your own fun, like out here, sledding with your friends.”</p>
<p>The temperature in parts of Iowa could dip as low as minus 14 F (minus 26 C) on Monday, when the state’s caucuses kick off the presidential primary season. And forecasters said it would be Wednesday before below-zero windchills go away.</p>
<p>Republicans Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley and former President Donald Trump all canceled campaign events because of the storm.</p>
<p>Electricity was out Saturday afternoon in hundreds of thousands of households and businesses, mainly in Michigan, Oregon and Wisconsin, according to poweroutage.us.</p>
<p>In Yankton, South Dakota, the temperature was minus 15 F (minus 26 C) in the evening. Police there said plows were “freezing and breaking,” so they would not operate until conditions improve. The Minnehaha County Highway Department also pulled its plows “due to low visibility and extreme cold temps.”</p>
<p>In other places, if the problem wasn’t snow and wind, it was water: Record high tides hit the Northeast, flooding some homes in Maine and New Hampshire.</p>
<p>The coastal Northeast was pounded by 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of rain in the morning, and a storm surge amplified what was already the month’s highest tide, National Weather Service meteorologist Michael Cempa said. In Portland, Maine, a gauge recorded a 14.57-foot (4.4-meter) difference between high and average low tide, topping a prior record of 14.17 feet (4.3 meters) set in 1978.</p>
<p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul warned of a “dangerous storm” as she announced that the Buffalo Bills-Pittsburgh Steelers NFL playoff game was postponed from Sunday to Monday. Residents of the county that includes Buffalo were told to stay off the roads starting at 9 p.m. Saturday, with the forecast calling for 1 to 2 feet (0.3 to 0.6 meters) or more of snow and winds gusting as high as 65 mph (105 kph). </p>
<p>Kansas City, Missouri, hosted a frigid playoff game Saturday night between the Chiefs and the Miami Dolphins. It was minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 20 degrees Celsius) at kickoff, easily setting a record for the coldest game at Arrowhead Stadium.</p>
<p>Still, hundreds of fans lined up hours beforehand outside the Arrowhead Stadium parking lots, some with ski goggles, heated socks and other winter gear they bought for the game.</p>
<p>Chiefs season ticket holder Keaton Schlatter and his friends had considered trying to sell their seats, as many other fans did.</p>
<p>“But we decided that it’s all part of the experience, and we didn’t want to miss it,” said Schlatter, of West Des Moines, Iowa.</p>
<p>In Oregon, Robert Banks, who has been homeless for several years, stood outside his blue tent along a Portland street in the afternoon, wearing one glove as sleet pelted him. He said he wanted to secure his belongings before making his way to a shelter.</p>
<p>“I lived in Alaska for a number of years,” he said. “The wind and the wet cold is different from dry tundra cold … oh, it is bone-chilling.”</p>
<p>The snow was welcome in at least one place.</p>
<p>Philip Spitzley of Lake Odessa, Michigan, woke up Friday to 95 small snowmen in his front yard to celebrate his 95th birthday. Fifteen family members and a neighbor collaborated on the snow-packing job, which took about 90 minutes.</p>
<p>“I was quite surprised,” Spitzley said. “I sat right here watching my TV and didn’t know they were out there. Then I saw flashlights.” </p>
<p>The display has turned into a spectacle as motorists slow down for a look. And with days of cold weather ahead, “they’ll be there awhile,” Spitzley said.</p>

<h2 id="fossil-unearthed-in-new-mexico-years-ago-is-identified-as-t.-rex-relative">Fossil Unearthed in New Mexico Years Ago Is Identified as T. Rex Relative</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico — The Tyrannosaurus rex seemingly came out of nowhere tens of millions of years ago, with its monstrous teeth and powerful jaws dominating the end of the age of the dinosaurs. </p>
<p>How it came to be is among the many mysteries that paleontologists have long tried to solve. Researchers from several universities and the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science say they now have one more piece of the puzzle. </p>
<p>On Thursday, they unveiled fossil evidence and published their findings in the journal Scientific Reports. Their study identifies a new subspecies of tyrannosaur thought to be an older and more primitive relative of the well-known T. rex. </p>
<p>There were oohs and ahs as the massive jaw bone and pointy teeth were revealed to a group of schoolchildren. Pieces of the fragile specimen were first found in the 1980s by boaters on the shore of New Mexico’s largest reservoir. </p>
<p>The identification of the new subspecies came through a meticulous reexamination of the jaw and other pieces of the skull that were collected over years at the site. The team analyzed the specimen bone by bone, noting differences in numerous features compared with those synonymous with T. rex. </p>
<p>“Science is a process. With each new discovery, it forces us to go back and test and challenge what we thought we knew, and that’s the core story of this project,” said Anthony Fiorillo, a co-author of the study and the executive director of the museum. </p>
<p>The differences between T. rex and Tyrannosaurus mcraeensis are subtle. But that’s typically the case in closely related species, said Nick Longrich, a co-author from the Milner Centre for Evolution at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom. </p>
<p>“Evolution slowly causes mutations to build up over millions of years, causing species to look subtly different over time,” he said. </p>
<p>The analysis suggests the new subspecies Tyrannosaurus mcraeensis was a side-branch in the species’ evolution, rather than a direct ancestor of T. rex. </p>
<p>The researchers determined it predated T. rex by up to 7 million years, showing that tyrannosaurs were in North America long before paleontologists previously thought.</p>
<p>T. rex has a reputation as a fierce predator. It measured up to 40 feet (12 meters) long and 12 feet (3.6 meters) high. Study co-author Sebastian Dalman and the other researchers say T. mcraeensis was roughly the same size and also ate meat. </p>
<p>Thomas Richard Holtz, a paleontologist at the University of Maryland who was not involved in the study, said the tyrannosaur fossil from New Mexico has been known for a while but its significance was not clear. </p>
<p>One interesting aspect of the research is that it appears T. rex’s closest relatives were from southern North America, with the exception of Mongolian Tarbosaurus and Chinese Zhuchengtyrannus, Holtz said. That leaves the question of whether these Asian dinosaurs were immigrants from North America or if the new subspecies and other large tyrannosaurs were immigrants from Asia. </p>
<p>“One great hindrance to solving this question is that we don’t have good fossil sites of the right environments in Asia older than Tarbosaurus and Zhuchengtyrannus, so we can’t see if their ancestors were present there or not,” Holtz said. </p>
<p>He and the researchers who analyzed the specimen agree that more fossils from the Hall Lake Formation in southern New Mexico could help answer further questions.</p>

<h2 id="jewish-students-sue-harvard-alleging-civil-rights-violations">Jewish Students Sue Harvard, Alleging Civil Rights Violations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BOSTON — Several Jewish students have filed a lawsuit against Harvard University, accusing it of becoming “a bastion of rampant anti-Jewish hatred and harassment.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit filed Wednesday mirrors others filed since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, including against The Art Institute of Chicago, New York University and the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>In the Harvard lawsuit, the plaintiffs include members of the Students Against Antisemitism, Inc. They accuse Harvard of violating Jewish students’ civil rights and allege that the university tolerated Jewish students being harassed, assaulted and intimidated — behavior that has intensified since the October 7 attack.</p>
<p>“Mobs of pro-Hamas students and faculty have marched by the hundreds through Harvard’s campus, shouting vile antisemitic slogans and calling for death to Jews and Israel,” according to the lawsuit. “Those mobs have occupied buildings, classrooms, libraries, student lounges, plazas, and study halls, often for days or weeks at a time, promoting violence against Jews.”</p>
<p>It was unclear what the reference to mobs in the lawsuit refers to, but the university has been rattled by protests since the October 7 attack. At one point, pro-Palestinian students occupied a campus building for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Marc Kasowitz, a partner at the law firm that brought the suit, Kasowitz Benson Torres, said in a statement that the litigation was necessary because Harvard would not “correct its deep-seated antisemitism problem voluntarily.”</p>
<p>“Harvard must be forced to protect its Jewish students and stop applying a double standard when it comes to anti-Jewish bigotry,” he added.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Harvard said the school doesn’t comment on pending litigation. About a dozen students are potentially facing disciplinary charges for violations of protest rules related to pro-Palestinian activities, but the spokesman said the school couldn’t comment on their cases.</p>
<p>Fallout from the Israel-Hamas war has roiled campuses across the U.S. and reignited a debate over free speech. College leaders have struggled to define the line where political speech crosses into harassment and discrimination, with Jewish and Arab students raising concerns that their schools are doing too little to protect them.</p>
<p>The issue took center stage in December when the presidents of Harvard, Penn and MIT testified at a congressional hearing on campus antisemitism. Asked by Republican lawmakers whether calls for the genocide of Jews would violate campus policies, the presidents offered lawyerly answers and declined to say unequivocally that it was prohibited speech.</p>
<p>Their answers prompted weeks of backlash from donors and alumni, leading to the resignation of Liz Magill at Penn and Claudine Gay at Harvard.</p>
<p>Hamas’ October 7 attacks killed 1,200 people in Israel, mainly civilians, and abducted around 250 others, nearly half of whom were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November.</p>
<p>Since the war began, Israel’s assault in Gaza has killed more than 23,200 Palestinians, roughly 1% of the territory’s population, and more than 58,000 people have been wounded, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. About two-thirds of the dead are women or children.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Education has repeatedly warned colleges that they are required to fight antisemitism and Islamophobia on their campuses or risk losing federal money. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said the agency has opened more than 40 investigations at colleges and universities in response to complaints of antisemitism and Islamophobia since the Oct. 7 attacks, including at Harvard, Stanford and MIT.</p>
<p>“No student should feel unsafe on campus,” Cardona told The Associated Press on Wednesday, after he met with students. “The Office for Civil Rights takes these cases very seriously. They investigate harassment, or violations for antisemitism, Islamophobia, anti-Arab sentiment. We take that role very seriously. If any student on campus feels that any protest or messaging makes them feel unsafe, we ask for an investigation.”</p>
<p>In November, Gay issued a memo laying out plans to address antisemitism on campus.</p>
<p>The university said it was starting a process to examine “how antisemitism manifests within our community” and developing a plan to address it. It also is implementing a program to educate students and faculty about antisemitism and “redoubling our efforts to make students aware that appropriate avenues exist to report feelings of fear or incidents causing harm” including an anonymous hotline for bias incidents.</p>

<h2 id="stitch-images-together-with-stitchy">Stitch images together with Stitchy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
From time to time I need to stitch together two or three images into a horizontal or vertical image. It seems so wasteful to spin up a whole design document for that task. What I wanted was a CLI that does that for me and I found one that does the job: Stitchy.
</p>
<h2>
How to use Stitchy
</h2>
<p>
Stitchy is a Rust package that does what it says on the tin, it stitches images together.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">Install Rust and Cargo</a>
</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">curl <span class="nt">--proto</span> <span class="s1">'=https'</span> <span class="nt">--tlsv1</span>.2 <span class="nt">-sSf</span> https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Install <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/stitchy">Stitchy</a>
</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">cargo <span class="nb">install </span>stitchy
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Use Stitchy
</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">stitchy image1.png image2.png
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
If you’re feeling even lazier and don’t want to type file names, you can have Stitchy grab the <code>n</code> latest images in the directory and/or set the <code>–order</code> flag to <code>alphabetical</code>.
</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">stitchy 4 
stitchy 4 <span class="nt">--order</span><span class="o">=</span>alphabetical 
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<h2>
Stitchy for responsive images
</h2>
<p>
By default Stitchy will assemble the images in order in a tight grid. Where Stitchy shines is generating responsive images where you might show a grid of images on mobile and a horizontal filmstrip on desktop.
</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">stitchy 4     <span class="c"># layout images in a grid</span>
stitchy 4 <span class="nt">-h</span>  <span class="c"># layout images horizontally</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Here’s an example of a responsive image treatment I did on <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/12/vibe-check-30/">a recent Vibe Check</a>.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2023/vc30-read.jpg" alt="Four books covers (The Big Myth, The Hard Switch, The Oven, and Subtract) arranged in a horizontal row" />
</p>
<figcaption>
The desktop version of the last four books I’ve read
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
If you resize your browser to a smaller viewport, you can see how the wide but short image loses hierarchy and readability on mobile, so I used <code>stitchy</code> to cut a new version for desktop.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2023/vc30-read-mobile.jpg" alt="Four books covers (The Big Myth, The Hard Switch, The Oven, and Subtract) arranged in a staggered grid" />
</p>
<figcaption>
The mobile version of the last four books I’ve read
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
No one noticed I did this, no one said “thanks”, but these types of small touches are my favorite responsive techniques.
</p>
<h2>
Other things Stitchy can do
</h2>
<p>
Stitchy gives you a bit more control in setting a <code>–maxw</code> or <code>–maxh</code> if that’s part of the effect. You can also set the output format to <code>–jpg</code> or <code>–png</code> if needed as well as control the <code>–quality</code>.
</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="bash">stitchy 4 <span class="nt">--png</span>
stitchy 4 <span class="nt">--jpg</span> <span class="nt">--quality</span><span class="o">=</span>75
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<h2>
Enjoy Stitchy
</h2>
<p>
And that’s Stitchy! It’s pretty handy if you ask me.
</p>
<p>
I wrote this post because I use it so infrequently and there’s not much documentation beyond the <code>–help</code> command, so I wanted to have this to remember how to use it.

<p>WASHINGTON — John Kerry, the U.S. special envoy on climate, is stepping down from the Biden administration in the coming weeks, according to two people familiar with his plans. </p>
<p>Kerry, a longtime senator and secretary of state, was tapped shortly after Joe Biden’s November 2020 election to take on the new role created specifically to fight climate change on behalf of the administration on the global stage. </p>
<p>Kerry’s departure plans were first reported Saturday by Axios. </p>
<p>Kerry was one of the leading drafters of the 2015 Paris climate accords and came into the role with significant experience abroad, as secretary of state during the Obama administration and from nearly three decades as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Biden’s decision to tap Kerry for the post was seen as one way the incoming president was making good on his campaign pledge to battle climate change in a more forceful and visible manner than in previous administrations. </p>
<p>“The climate crisis is a universal threat to humankind and we all have a responsibility to deal with it as rapidly as we can,” Kerry said in a visit to Beijing last summer, when he met with Vice President Han Zheng on climate matters. </p>
<p>At international climate summits, Kerry always kept a breakneck pace, going from one meeting to another, with world leaders, major business figures and scientists, all interspersed with one press conference after another — to share what he just learned, announce an initiative, or say a few words as civil groups announced their own plans to help combat climate change, thus lending his credibility and weight. </p>
<p>In the span an hour, at one meeting Kerry would talk in detail about the need for oil companies to drastically reduce methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, then go to another gathering and detail his latest idea to help pay for green energy transition in developing countries and then, some minutes later, go into a long explanation of illegal fishing around the world while attending an event with leaders of Pacific Island nations. </p>
<p>“John Kerry’s tireless work to deliver global progress on the climate crisis has been heroic,” former Vice President Al Gore, who has focused primarily on climate in his post-public office life, said in a statement Saturday. “He has approached this challenge with bold vision, resolute determination, and the urgency that this crisis demands. For that the U.S. and the whole world owe him a huge debt of gratitude.”</p>
<p>While his gravitas has made him a central climate figure around the world, Kerry also has strong critics who argue America’s climate policies don’t amount to leadership in fighting global warming. The Inflation Reduction Act, the largest climate law in U.S. history, is pumping billions of dollars into renewable energies. But many facets of the law emphasize domestic production, thus leading other nations to complain that the law is protectionist and detrimental to their own green industries.</p>
<p>And for years, the United States opposed the creation of a “loss and damage” fund that would see rich nations contribute billions of dollars to help developing countries, often hit hard by extreme weather events driven by climate change. During COP27 in Egypt in 2022, the fund was approved, as the U.S. and other rich countries relented and supported it. However, Kerry is always quick to say the fund is not about “reparations” or “compensation,” and so far the U.S. has promised only modest funding for it.</p>
<p>Kerry represented Massachusetts for 28 years in the Senate and was also the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004.</p>

<h2 id="navy-seals-missing-after-night-mission-off-somali-coast">2 Navy SEALs Missing After Night Mission off Somali Coast</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Two U.S. Navy SEALs are missing after conducting a nighttime boarding mission Thursday off the coast of Somalia, according to three U.S. officials.</p>
<p>The SEALs were on an interdiction mission, climbing up a vessel when one got knocked off by high waves. Under their protocol, when one SEAL is overtaken the next jumps in after them.</p>
<p>Both SEALs are still missing. A search and rescue mission is under way and the waters in the Gulf of Aden, where they were operating, are warm, two of the U.S. officials said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy has conducted regular interdiction missions, where they have intercepted weapons on ships that were bound for Houthi-controlled Yemen.</p>
<p>The mission was not related to Operation Prosperity Guardian, the ongoing U.S. and international mission to provide protection to commercial vessels in the Red Sea, or the retaliatory strikes that the United States and the United Kingdom have conducted in Yemen over the past two days, the official said Saturday. It was also not related to the seizure of the oil tanker St. Nikolas by Iran, a third U.S. official said.</p>
<p>The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details that have not yet been made public.</p>
<p>Besides defending ships from the drones and missiles launched from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, the U.S. military has also come to the aid of commercial ships that have been the targets of piracy.</p>
<p>In a statement Saturday, U.S. Central Command said it would not release additional information on the Thursday night incident until the personnel recovery mission is complete.</p>
<p>The sailors were forward-deployed to the U.S. 5th Fleet area of operations supporting a wide variety of missions.</p>

<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>As Democrats shift their presidential preference caucus to mail-in balloting in Iowa with incumbent President Joe Biden the likely winner, Republicans take center stage during Iowa’s 2024 Caucus, when supporters assemble in person to choose their candidate for the Republican nomination. VOA’s Kane Farabaugh reports from Iowa.</p>

<h2 id="dangerous-cold-snap-blankets-iowa-ahead-of-caucuses">Dangerous Cold Snap Blankets Iowa Ahead of Caucuses</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>des moines, iowa — First it was the snow, then the bitter cold temperatures that iced out most of the campaign events in the U.S. Midwestern state of Iowa the weekend before the January 15 caucuses.</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump, who has spent much of the week before the caucuses outside of the state, canceled most of his in-person events because of the weather.</p>
<p>Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley moved many of her events online.</p>
<p>“It will make the non-passionate people stay home, and the passionate people will come out,” said Carson Odle, who was undeterred by the bad weather as he attended one of the few, in-person events that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis didn’t cancel, in the Des Moines suburb of Ankeny.</p>
<p>“The die-hards will come,” said Cheryl Weisheit, who also braved traveling in the snowstorm to hear DeSantis’ campaign pitch. “Early on it wasn’t that bad. … I don’t know … we’re just so used to this!”</p>
<p>Weisheit, who chairs a local Republican group, said physically attending an event was important to her because she still doesn’t know who to support on caucus night.</p>
<p>“I probably won’t know until that night,” she said.</p>
<p>Snow could affect turnout</p>
<p>Iowa Democrats shifted their presidential preference caucuses to mail-in balloting later in the election cycle, with incumbent President Joe Biden the likely winner.</p>
<p>So Republicans will take center stage during Iowa’s 2024 Caucuses, a first-in-the-nation event when supporters assemble in person to choose their candidate for the Republican nomination. It comes amid some of the heaviest snow and coldest temperatures Iowa has experienced during the caucuses in many years, creating several unknowns for how it will impact the results.</p>
<p>“The unknown here is how much the supporters for the various candidates will turn out,” said University of Iowa political science professor Tim Hagle. “Will the Trump supporters really be as loyal to him and as faithful to him as everyone expects?”</p>
<p>Hagle said if polling translates into turnout, it’s more difficult for the Republicans vying to unseat Trump as the front-runner and curbs their ability to pick up momentum as the race moves beyond Iowa.</p>
<p>“If Trump is still 30 points ahead or maybe even more, it seems pretty unlikely that DeSantis or Haley is going to be able to beat him or even come close because to a certain extent they are splitting the anti-Trump vote,” he said.</p>
<p>Hagle added that polling also shows Trump’s legal troubles haven’t dampened his support.</p>
<p>“Given that he was indicted in four different places, he’s got a civil trial going on in New York, he’s got a defamation trial going on there as well, states are trying to kick him off the ballot, all this means — in the eyes of a lot of his supporters — is that they’re politically persecuting him and so there’s a rally-around-the-chief effect that’s going on,” Hagle said.</p>
<p>Campaigns urge voters to show up</p>
<p>But there are signs of fatigue among Iowa voters. Retired police officer John Frank supported Trump before, but not this year.</p>
<p>“He’s getting up in age, just like Joe Biden, and we have to consider that,” Frank told VOA. “And he’s never learned in his life, especially his political life, to keep his mouth shut.”</p>
<p>Frank said he’ll caucus for DeSantis.</p>
<p>“Trump is probably going to win, but I don’t think it’s going to the be slam dunk people think,” said Weisheit, who has narrowed her choices to DeSantis and Haley, but not Trump.</p>
<p>“Well, if Trump is the candidate, I will [vote for him], but right now … he’s not the one that I will caucus for,” she said.</p>
<p>“You really have to energize your supporters and get them to turn out,” Hagle said, because “we often see some movement up until caucus night,” which is why the messaging from every candidate left in the race in the final days of the campaign is a push to encourage their supporters to physically show up to support them at caucus locations across the state on January 15.</p>

<h2 id="us-congressional-leaders-prepare-bill-to-fund-government-to-march">US Congressional Leaders Prepare Bill to Fund Government to March</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Congressional leaders are preparing a stopgap bill to keep the federal government running into March and avoid a partial shutdown next week.</p>
<p>The temporary measure will run to March 1 for some federal agencies whose approved funds are set to run out Friday and extend the remainder of government operations to March 8. That’s according to a person familiar with the situation and granted anonymity to discuss it. Several media outlets are also reporting on the agreement to keep the government open.</p>
<p>The stopgap bill, expected to be released Sunday, would come as House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has been under pressure from his hard-right flank in recent days to jettison a recent bipartisan spending deal with Senate Democrats. The bill would need Democratic support to pass the narrowly divided House.</p>
<p>Johnson insisted Friday that he is sticking with the deal he struck with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., despite pressure from some conservatives to renegotiate. Moderates in the party had urged him to stay the course.</p>
<p>Still, in his first big test as the new leader, he has yet to show how he will quell the revolt from his right flank that ousted his predecessor.</p>
<p>“Our top-line agreement remains,” Johnson said Friday, referring to the budget accord reached January 7.</p>
<p>That accord sets $1.66 trillion in spending for the next fiscal year, with $886 billion of the tally going to defense.</p>
<p>Hard-right members have criticized the deal, including several of those who helped oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy from the speaker’s office last year after he struck a spending deal with Democrats and President Joe Biden. Some have already raised the threat of a motion to oust Johnson over the deal, not even three months after he was elected.</p>
<p>The hard-right flank is also insisting that new immigration policies be included, which they say would stop the record flow of migrants at the U.S-Mexico border.</p>
<p>Johnson met with about two dozen House Republicans this past week, many of them centrist-leaning voices urging him not to go back on his word and stick with the deal. The centrists assured Johnson that they will support him.</p>
<p>“I just can’t imagine the House wants to relive the madness,” said Rep. French Hill, R-Ark., who had helped McCarthy negotiate the initial agreement with Biden and the other leaders.</p>
