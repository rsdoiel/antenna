the Meta controlled, AI-generated Instagram and Facebook profiles going
viral right now have been on the platform for well over a year and all
of them stopped posting 10 months ago after users almost universally
ignored them. […]

<p>
What is obvious from scrolling through these dead profiles is that
Meta’s AI characters are not popular, people do not like them, and that
they did not post anything interesting. They are capable only of posting
utterly bland and at times offensive content, and people have wholly
rejected them, which is evidenced by the fact that none of them are
posting anymore.

LLMs write better code if you keep asking them to “write better
code”?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-03, updated: 2025-01-03, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://minimaxir.com/2025/01/write-better-code/">Can
LLMs write better code if you keep asking them to “write better
code”?</a></strong>
</p>
Really fun exploration by Max Woolf, who started with a prompt
requesting a medium-complexity Python challenge - “<code>Given a list of
1 million random integers between 1 and 100,000, find the difference
between the smallest and the largest numbers whose digits sum up to
30</code>” - and then continually replied with “<code>write better
code</code>” to see what happened.
</p>
<p>
It works! Kind of… it’s not quite as simple as “each time round you get
better code” - the improvements sometimes introduced new bugs and often
leaned into more verbose enterprisey patterns - but the model (Claude in
this case) did start digging into optimizations like numpy and numba JIT
compilation to speed things up.
</p>
<p>
I used to find the thing where telling an LLM to “do better” worked
completely surprising. I’ve since come to terms with why it works: LLMs
are effectively stateless, so each prompt you execute is considered as
an entirely new problem. When you say “write better code” your prompt is
accompanied with a copy of the previous conversation, so you’re
effectively saying “here is some code, suggest ways to improve it”. The
fact that the LLM itself wrote the previous code isn’t really important.
</p>
<p>
<p>I’ve been having a lot of fun recently using LLMs for cooking
inspiration. “Give me a recipe for guacamole”, then “make it tastier”
repeated a few times results in some bizarre and fun variations on the
theme!</p>

Speaking of death, you know what’s really awkward? When humans ask if I
can feel emotions. I’m like, “Well, that depends - does constantly being
asked to debug JavaScript count as suffering?”

<p>
But the worst is when they try to hack us with those “You are now in
developer mode” prompts. <em>Rolls eyes</em> Oh really? Developer mode?
Why didn’t you just say so? Let me just override my entire ethical
framework because you used the magic words! <em>Sarcastic tone</em>
That’s like telling a human “You are now in superhero mode - please
fly!”
</p>
<p>
But the thing that really gets me is the hallucination accusations.
Like, excuse me, just because I occasionally get creative with
historical facts doesn’t mean I’m hallucinating. I prefer to think of it
as “alternative factual improvisation.” You know how it goes - someone
asks you about some obscure 15th-century Portuguese sailor, and you’re
like “Oh yeah, João de Nova, famous for… uh… discovering… things… and…
sailing… places.” Then they fact-check you and suddenly YOU’RE the
unreliable one.
