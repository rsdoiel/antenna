Cases Are Spiking on a Warmer, Wetter World</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-30, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDYwMTE1Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczOTMzNTkxMH0.8lFsMv6myb0ibin9VSbRKgXa1JAyFe6VHKF0XFbDgJI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
The World Health Organization’s annual
<a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240086173" target="_blank">malaria
report</a>, released Thursday, for the first time includes a chapter
“focused on the intersection between climate change and malaria” — and
finds that climate change was a factor in a global increase in the
disease. There were an estimated 249 million malaria cases in 2022, a
five million increase over the previous year. Most of the new cases were
concentrated in Pakistan, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, and
Uganda.
</p>
<p>
The reasons for the surge seem to be manifold. Across sub-saharan
Africa, the Anopheles mosquito, which transmits the disease, is
expanding its range as the region warms. Flooding can also leave behind
stagnant pools of standing water, which leads to a boom in mosquito
numbers,
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-flood-victims-hit-by-disease-outbreak-amid-stagnant-water-2022-09-21/" target="_blank">as
followed</a> Pakistan’s catastrophic floods in 2022. And as people are
displaced by such disasters, those without malarial immunity may settle
in areas prone to the disease. In many cases they also live in tents or
refugee centers, without simple yet crucial protections such as mosquito
nets.
</p>
<p>
As is so often the case with climate change, the problems are at once
immense — increasing heat in Subsaharan Africa and South Asia — and
practical — not enough nets. “It is crucial to recognize the multitude
of threats that impede our response efforts,”
<a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/30-11-2023-who-s-annual-malaria-report-spotlights-the-growing-threat-of-climate-change" target="_blank">said</a>
Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization’s Regional Director for
Africa. “Climate variability poses a substantial risk, but we must also
contend with challenges such as limited healthcare access, [and] ongoing
conflicts and emergencies … we need a concerted effort to tackle these
diverse threats.”

<h2 id="rocket-launched-at-us-forces-in-syria-no-injuries">Rocket
Launched at US Forces in Syria; No Injuries</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Iranian-backed proxies launched a rocket assault against U.S. forces
in the Middle East, bringing the total number of attacks on U.S. and
coalition troops in Iraq and Syria to 74 since October 17.</p>
<p>A U.S. defense official told VOA a single rocket was launched
overnight against Mission Support Site Euphrates in eastern Syria,
causing no casualties or damage.</p>
<p>U.S. naval forces in the Middle East continue to counter threats at
sea as well. On Wednesday, while in the southern Red Sea, the USS Carney
missile destroyer shot down an Iranian-produced drone launched from
areas of Yemen controlled by Iranian-backed Houthi militants.</p>
<p>“Although its intentions are not known, the UAV [drone] was heading
toward the warship. At the time of the shootdown, the USS Carney was
escorting the USNS Supply [oiler] and another U.S.-flagged and -crewed
ship carrying military equipment to the region,” U.S. Central Command
said.</p>
<p>There were no injuries or damage to any of the vessels during the
incident.</p>
<p>On Sunday, two ballistic missiles were fired from Houthi-controlled
areas in Yemen in the direction of the USS Mason, a destroyer, as it
came to the aid of a commercial vessel that was dealing with an apparent
pirate attack.</p>
<p>The Pentagon has officially said that it doesn’t believe the USS
Mason was the missiles’ target, but two defense officials have since
told VOA they disagree with that assessment.</p>
<p>U.S. has countered attacks in Iraq, Syria</p>
<p>Last week, U.S. forces carried out three strikes within 24 hours
against Iranian-backed forces and their facilities in what the military
said was a “direct response to attacks against U.S. and coalition forces
by Iran and Iran-backed groups.”</p>
<p>Two of the U.S. strikes targeted an operations center and a
command-and-control node used by the Iranian-backed militant group
Kataib Hezbollah near Al Anbar and Jurf al-Saqr in Iraq, a defense
official told VOA. Kataib Hezbollah forces were present at the two
facilities, which the defense official said had supported recent attacks
on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria.</p>
<p>Early assessments pointed to at least six militants killed in the two
strikes, the defense official said.</p>
<p>A third U.S. attack struck and killed Iranian-backed proxies who
earlier had launched a close-range ballistic missile against al-Asad air
base in Iraq.</p>
<p>It was the first time a ballistic missile had been launched against
U.S. forces in the Middle East since the surge in attacks began on
October 17. Ballistic missiles can be much more powerful and carry much
more destructive payloads than the rockets and drones used in
previous attacks. </p>
<p>U.S. Central Command said the ballistic missile attack caused eight
injuries to U.S. personnel and minor damage to infrastructure. </p>
<p>Prior to last week’s attacks, U.S. fighter jets had carried out three
rounds of strikes targeting four facilities in Syria used by Iran’s
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and their proxy groups since October
17.</p>
<p>Most attacks disrupted</p>
<p>Most of the 74 attacks since October 17 were disrupted by the U.S.
military or failed to reach their targets, causing no casualties or
damage to infrastructure, according to the military. But a handful of
attacks have injured dozens of U.S. military personnel. Some suffered
shrapnel wounds or perforated eardrums, while a few suffered traumatic
brain injuries.</p>
<p>One U.S. contractor at al-Asad Air Base in Iraq suffered a cardiac
episode and died while sheltering in place during a false alarm for an
air attack. </p>
<p>Since U.S. President Joe Biden took office in January 2021,
Iranian-backed proxies have attacked U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria more
than 160 times.</p>
<p>A spate of attacks from Iranian-backed militants in March killed a
U.S. contractor in Syria, caused traumatic brain injuries in 23 military
personnel and wounded 25 U.S. military personnel, according to the
Pentagon. </p>
<p>The Pentagon responded with air strikes against Iranian-backed
facilities in Syria, much like the strikes carried out by U.S. forces in
recent weeks. </p>
<p>The last time Iran or Iranian-backed proxies used ballistic missiles
against U.S. forces in Iraq was in 2020 following a U.S. attack in Iraq
that killed Iranian Quds force leader Qassem Soleimani.</p>

<h2 id="new-scripting-news-home-page">New Scripting News home page</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-30, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
It’s been five years since I re-did the Scripting News home page. It was
overdue. The new version isn’t all that different on the surface from
the previous version, here’s a list of things to look at.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Blog, the first tab, becomes
<a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=dave">Dave</a>.
</li>
<li>
The News tab now is named
<a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=bloggers">Bloggers</a> and it does
something different, more on that in a bit.
</li>
<li>
The tabs work better, the pages aren’t reloaded when you click on one of
the tabs, but the URL in your browser’s address bar changes, so you can
bookmark it and go directly to the page you’re interested in. And the
browser Back button works as you would expect.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The big change under the covers is that it hooks into
<a href="https://feedland.org/">FeedLand</a> on its own. When you’re
reading the <a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=bloggers">Bloggers
tab</a>, you’re reading content that came directly from the new
Automattic-hosted FeedLand server.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://feedland.com/opml?screenname=davewiner&catname=bloggers">list
of feeds</a> behind the Bloggers tab right now are just placeholders.
We’re going to work with other sources, using reading lists, to create a
news flow from blogs that we think are interesting, along with what
other people think are interesting. How this will develop is not yet
clear, but we are going to work on this. When I say “we,” I mean
<a href="https://cagrimmett.com/">Chuck Grimmett</a> and myself and
others at Automattic. This is the kind of stuff they do for WordPress
users, so it fits right in imho with our respective skills.

for myself, I want to engage with more bloggers. We used to have
something, and I think we can again.
</p>
<p>
We’re putting a lot of development behind this. FeedLand has been in
development for almost three freaking years. This last year has been
spent turning corners, and building out features so they can scale to
Automattic-level flow. And adding one major new kickass feature to the
world of feeds – reading lists. The ability to subscribe to lists of
feeds. We’re going to use that in a lot of places. I wanted to get that
in the product before we started using it. And it’s in, and it works.
There are still a few glitches to work out, you know – software can
always work better than it does. <span
class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</p>
<p>
All I can say is we’re getting there. Today’s FeedLand does a lot more
and works a lot better than last year’s.
</p>
<p>
And now Scripting News is part of that. So we’ll be able to make the new
stuff more visible, by using it here in this site.
</p>
<p>
<i>Still diggin!</i>

<p>
As they say.

Anything Elon Musk says must be treated skeptically. This is
particularly true of anything involving timescales (see
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2021/08/autonowashing.html">Tesla
robotaxis</a>). And it is even more true of Musk’s plans for
<a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/">visiting</a>
and eventually colonizing Mars.<br /> <br /> Below the fold in part 1 of
this two-part post, I apply some arithmetic just to the logistics of
Musk’s plans for Mars. Part 2 isn’t specific to Musk’s plans; I discuss
two attempts to list the set of “knowns” about Mars exploration, for
which the science is fairly clear but the engineering and the economics
don’t exist, and the much larger set of “known unknowns”, critical
aspects requiring robust solutions for which the science, let alone the
engineering, doesn’t exist:<br />

The plan is to “build 1000+ Starships to transport life to Mars.

statement he had made during a recent interview with TED curator Chris

<blockquote>
SpaceX and Musk have stated their goal of colonizing Mars to ensure the
long-term survival of humanity, with an ambition of sending a thousand
Starship spacecraft to Mars during a Mars launch window in a very far
future.
</blockquote>
SpaceX’s Starship is claimed to be able to
“<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/starship-spacex-mega-rocket-makes-it-to-space">carry
more than 100 tons of payload to the lunar surface in a single
flight</a>” and, using on-orbit refueling,
“<a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/">up to 100 tons
all the way to Mars</a>”. The Mars mission depends upon refueling the
Starship on-orbit from fuel tankers launched beforehand on the Super
Heavy booster.<br /> <br />
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship#Potential_uses">Musk
has predicted that a Starship orbital launch will eventually cost $1
million</a>” but a more realistic estimate is about $1.5M, or $10/Kg.
Each launch requires a <i>lot</i> of fuel.
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship#Planned_mission_profile">Roughly
four hundred truck deliveries are needed for one launch</a>”<br />
<br /> The problem with refueling on-orbit is that getting the fuel up
for one mission requires a <i>lot</i> of launches. For a manned Moon
landing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship#Starship_spacecraft">the
Government Accountability Office said that SpaceX would “require 16
launches overall”</a>. So delivering 100,000 tonnes to Mars would
require 16,000 Super Heavy launches costing around $24B and involving
6.4M truck deliveries. One might think that the launches could take the
whole of the 780-day interval between
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_of_Mars#Launch_windows">Mars
launch windows</a>, or a rate of just over 20/day. But because the fuel
in the orbital tanks boils off over time, the launches have to happen
much faster than that, perhaps around 50/day. in 2022 the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9#Launch_history">Falcon 9
launched 60 times</a>, or 0.16/day. Getting to 50/day requires scaling
up over 300 times.<br /> <br /> SpaceX’s Falcon 9 has an astonishing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9#Launch_history">99.3%
success rate</a>. If the Mars vehicle had the same rate, an extra 113
launches would be needed to cover the failures. Of the 1,000 manned
launches, 7 would be failures, carrying 7,000 people.<br /> <br /> 1000
Starships carrying 1,000,000 people is 1,000 per Starship, which can
deliver 100 tons to Mars. That is 220lb/person, so apart from the person
and the spacesuit they will need to disembark, they won’t have many
carry-on bags in the overheads, let alone the air and food needed for
the journey. Everything they need to survive on Mars must already have
been delivered by earlier missions. Lets guess that each person needs 10
times their weight in life support and other equipment. So the 1M person
launch window must be preceded by 10 similar launch windows delivering
freight. Now we are talking $264B in launch costs alone, or $264K per
person. Even for Elon Musk, over a quarter-trillion dollars is real
money. Even that may not be enough. The history of Mars missions shows
that Mars landing is a high-risk endeavour. It is <i>very</i> unlikely
that all 10,000 freight missions would be successful.<br /> <br />

<p>10 launch windows is 7,800 days or more than 21 years. So if Musk
wants to land a million humans by 2050 he needs to start launching 50
Starships a day in 2029, a bit more than 5 years from now. Fortunately,
he has time to experiment. There are
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/dtm5bc/mars_launch_windows_20202030/?rdt=55849">two
launch windows</a> before the one when he needs to start in
earnest.<br /> <br /> If the Starships are to be reused, they have to be
re-fueled on Mars using fuel made locally from Martian resources. Each
Starship requires
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship#Starship_spacecraft">1,200
tons</a> of fuel. Thus unless the Starships are to be expended, during
the 2024 and 2026 launch windows Musk needs to deliver a factory to Mars
capable of producing 1.2M tons of fuel every 780 days, or nearly 1600
tons/day. Clearly, the factory must weigh several times its daily
output. Lets guess it weighs 20 times, or 32,000 tons. So in each of
those two launch windows Musk needs to send another 160 Starships to
Mars, requiring another 2,560 launches.<br /> <br /> But there’s another
huge problem with Musk’s fantasy. The 1,000 Martian emigrants will spend
something like 180 days cooped up in each Starship’s payload bay, which
has a volume of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship#Starship_spacecraft">1,000m<sup>3</sup></a>.
The average human’s volume is around
<a href="https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/the-human-cube-the-volume-of-humanity">0.06m<sup>3</sup></a>.
The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737#Specifications">cabin
volume per passenger of a 1-class 737</a> is around 0.22m<sup>3</sup>,
so each emigrant will spend 180 days in the equivalent of 4 seats in
coach in a 737. I think people paying more than a quarter-million
dollars in launch costs alone would be imagining something more like
business class! The migrants will end up fighting each other long before
they arrive.<br /> <br /> And, of course, once the million people land
on Mars the story isn’t over. They will still be dependent upon supplies
from Earth until they can build a completely self-sustaining ecology.
They may not need 100,000 tons of supplies every 780 days, but there
will still need to be a lot of launches to get fuel into orbit to get a
smaller number of Starships with supplies to Mars.<br /> <br /> Look, I
totally understand that what people like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos really
want is to call up the
<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/guide/magrathea.shtml">Magratheans</a>
and order one of their custom-made luxury planets lovingly made to their
exacting specifications, so they don’t have to deal with taxes,
government, competitors or people who disagree with them. Let alone
having to survive in a 2.5C warmer world racked with war, migration and
starvation that is depleting their support staff. It must be really
frustrating that niggling little issues like the speed of light mean
that the only planet they can afford isn’t just a long, slow, expensive
commute, but also needs a <i>lot</i> of work to make it a suitable home
for a multi-billionaire. That work is the subject of part 2.<br />
<br /> All it took for me to get this level of understanding of just the
logistics of Musk’s fantasy was his own numbers, an Internet connection,
a couple of hours, and basic arithmetic. Given Musk’s notorious lack of
credibility when it comes to schedules, it is disappointing that as far
as I can tell no journalist made the effort to inform the public that
Musk was BS-ing. Chris Young expressed mild skepticism, “just not very
realistic” and “risks putting him in similar territory as he was with
Tesla’s progress on Level 5 autonomy”. But that is a long way from
explaining Musk’s specific implausibilities.<br /> <br /></p>

id="asian-americans-still-face-prejudice-and-discrimination-study-finds">Asian
Americans Still Face Prejudice and Discrimination, Study Finds</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Facing prejudice is, for most Asian Americans, an all-too-familiar
part of life, a new report from the Pew Research Center shows.</p>
<p>The study, which is based on a survey of more than 7,000 respondents,
found that the majority of Asian Americans think too little national
attention is being paid to their experiences with discrimination.</p>
<p>About one-third of Asian Americans have been told to go back to their
home country, the report found. Forty-four percent of Asian Americans
ages 18 to 29 said they know an Asian person who has been personally
threatened or attacked since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>There are about 23.5 million Asian Americans, making up 7.1% of the
nation’s population. The year 2021 saw anti-Asian hate crimes in the
U.S. jump to an all-time high, and 2022 was the second-worst year on
record.</p>
<p>“Discrimination is nothing new against Asian Americans,” said Neil
Ruiz, head of New Research Initiatives at Pew and the study’s co-author.
Asian Americans have endured relentless stereotyping, reaching as far
back as the 1800s, and Ruiz’s study highlights a paradox at the crux of
that.</p>
<p>Asian American communities have for decades been typecast as model
minorities: “loyal and hardworking,” as one respondent put it. On the
other hand, Asian Americans have found themselves ostracized, treated as
what scholars and activists have dubbed “forever foreigners.”</p>
<p>‘Forever Foreigner’ Trope</p>
<p>“We found that 78% of Asian Americans have been treated as a
foreigner in some way, even if they were born in the United States,”
Ruiz, an Asian American himself, told VOA. Criteria include being told
to go back to one’s home country, being ridiculed for speaking a
language other than English in public or having one’s name pronounced
incorrectly.</p>
<p>Ruiz acknowledged that mispronouncing someone’s name can be an honest
mistake. But for many of the study’s participants, these incidents have
often bordered on disrespect or become outright offensive, he said.</p>
<p>Ruiz recounted how, in one focus group, an Indian American woman said
she had a list of more than 200 ways her name had been mispronounced,
leaving her feeling perpetually demeaned. Some reported that they had
felt pressured to adopt Anglicized names.</p>
<p>Russell Jeung, a professor of Asian American Studies at San Francisco
State University, said that fighting anti-Asian prejudice means creating
spaces where people “feel free to share how they are hurt or how others
might be hurt” by offhand remarks.</p>
<p>The harder question, activists say, is how to respond when it’s not
just a coworker making derisive comments but former President Donald
Trump or others in positions of authority, such as airport security
personnel who, according to the study, screen South Asian Americans at
markedly higher rates.</p>
<p>After Trump used offensive language during the pandemic, including
calling the coronavirus the “Chinese virus,” the non-profit group Stop
AAPI Hate found that use of anti-Asian slurs had risen online.</p>
<p>Having a tolerant national role model is “a matter of life or death,”
Jeung said.</p>
<p>Days after 9/11, then-President George W. Bush delivered a speech at
a mosque calling for respect for Islam. Hate crimes against Arab and
South Asian Americans immediately fell, according to the Center for the
Study of Hate &amp; Extremism.</p>
<p>“American leaders have a very deficient understanding of the
experiences and needs of a group as diverse as Asian America,” said
Charles Jung, a Californian civil rights lawyer and community
organizer.</p>
<p>National leaders, Jung said, have a responsibility to encourage
tolerance and to bring communities together by highlighting shared
values rather than perceived differences. “At a minimum, that means not
saying racist things and inflaming hatred,” Jung said. “But that’s the
bare minimum.”</p>
<p>Model Minority Stereotype</p>
<p>The notion that Asian Americans serve as a model for other minority
groups has been perpetuated in popular media for generations. In 1966,
The New York Times Magazine ran an article hailing Japanese Americans as
a “success story.” In 1987, Time magazine ran a cover story describing
Asian American children as “whiz kids.”</p>
<p>But Jung said the “model minority” stereotype is “certainly
flattening and simplistic — a cartoonish view of an entire people who
are incredibly diverse.”</p>
<p>The Pew survey found that most Asian Americans, particularly Indian
Americans, had not heard of the term “model minority,” though most
respondents said they had been presumed by peers to be good at math or
uncreative — two stereotypes associated with Asians.</p>
<p>Karthick Ramakrishnan, a professor of public policy at the University
of California, Riverside, and founder of AAPI Data, said that, compared
with East Asian Americans, “the model minority myth is not as much of a
barrier or a concern that South Asians have to deal with.”</p>
<p>“South Asians and East Asians experience racism and racial
discrimination differently,” Ramakrishnan added, citing disproportionate
security screenings and surveillance of South Asian Americans in the
post-9/11 era.</p>
<p>Of the Asian Americans who were familiar with the term, 42% said the
model minority stereotype is harmful.</p>
<p>There isn’t a consensus among Asian Americans: 17% thought the model
minority stereotype is positive, a stance Republican Asian Americans are
comparatively more likely to take.</p>
<p>Jeung counts himself among the 42% who believe the stereotype is
damaging. He said it “drives a wedge between Asians and other racial
groups. It also masks issues that Asians face: If we’re seen as a model,
we’re seen as not having any particular problems. But clearly, we face
racism.”</p>
<p>Jeung said the model minority stereotype belies a wide range of
social issues that many Asian Americans confront in their day-to-day
lives, from workplace discrimination (according to the Pew survey, about
1 in 5 Asian Americans said they had experienced anti-Asian workplace
discrimination) to expectations of perfection in the classroom and
beyond.</p>
<p>Despite the widespread problem of anti-Asian hate, the majority of
Asian American adults said the challenges of racism were rarely, if
ever, discussed in their households growing up.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, the adaptation that immigrant Asian parents adopt is
swallowing the bitterness and pain,” Jung said.</p>

month in Servo: better floats, :has(), color-mix(), and more!</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Our nightly example browser, servoshell, is now easier to navigate,
accepting URLs without http:// or https:// both in the location bar and
on the command line, and should no longer lock up when run with
–no-minibrowser. Local paths can also be given on the command line, and
are still preferred when the path points to a file that exists. Work is
now underway to improve our embedding story and prepare Servo for
integration with Tauri, starting with precompiled ANGLE for faster
initial builds, better support for offscreen rendering, and support for
multiple webviews. These changes haven’t landed yet, but once they do,
apps will be able to open, move, resize, and interleave Servo with other
widgets. I’m curious what the future will bring to Servo. It seems under
very active development, but it’s not part of any of the main browser
projects. Let’s hope they can keep up the momentum so that it can grow
into a viable alternative. Because lord do we need one.</p>

Pro CPU cores: general performance</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Evaluating the performance of CPUs with identical cores is relatively
straightforward, and they’re easy to compare using single- and
multi-core benchmarks. When there are two different types of core, one
designed primarily for energy efficiency (E), the other for maximum
performance (P), traditional benchmarks can readily mislead. Multi-core
results are dominated by the ratio of P to E cores, and variable
frequency confounds further. In this series of articles, I set out to
disentangle these when comparing core performance between Apple’s
original M1 Pro and its third-generation M3 Pro chips. This first
article explains why and how I am investigating this, and shows overall
results for performance and power use under a range of loads. Articles
like these will help you make an informed decision about whether or not
your workloads can benefit from moving from an M1/M2 to an M3.</p>

We’re in the thick of holiday shopping season. But as companies compete
for consumer dollars and distinguish themselves through advertising,
they’re taking inflation into account and trying to play to customer
emotions. Plus, X’s Elon Musk has some choice words for boycotting

<h2 id="the-cybertruck-is-interesting.-tesla-needs-boring.">The
Cybertruck Is Interesting. Tesla Needs Boring.</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-30, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDU4MTMzNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxNjE1NDU2Mn0.clC_eVrEBZOB6nktvPRYBIAtpOlILw-v7qJn0eY2G6E/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
While channel-surfing over Thanksgiving weekend, I stumbled upon <em>The
Aviator</em> — specifically, the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=qiDqiuX9ET4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">scene</a>
in which Leonardo DiCaprio’s Howard Hughes maniacally scrambles a fleet
of biplanes to capture the greatest air combat scenes even filmed, and
rants that he doesn’t care if the conservative suits at his company
worry he’s squandering his fortune in pursuit of a mad dream. It’s hard
to watch these scenes and not think of Elon Musk, Hughes’ heir apparent
(with apologies to Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos) as the leading
air-and-space-obsessed billionaire man-child of his era. That’s doubly
true this week, with the long-awaited official launch of the Tesla
Cybertuck.
</p>
<p>
Bold pursuit of the big dream has always been Musk’s calling card.
Before his rise to prominence, onlookers said it would be impossible to
start a new space launch company that could outcompete established
giants like Boeing and Lockheed Martin or start a new car company that
could outmaneuver giants like Ford and GM, much less do both at the same
time. Musk’s self-marketing as the real-world Tony Stark helped to sell
his electric vehicles and kept tech enthusiasts tuned in to his attempts
to land reusable space rockets on ocean-going platforms. The man and his
mad science were the message.
</p>
<p>
But the Tesla Cybertruck seemed like a turning point. Instead of chasing
another sci-fi dream of a better tomorrow, Musk in 2019 revealed a
boyhood cartoon: an all-metal, supposedly bulletproof tank that would
feel at home as an armored personnel carrier in some PlayStation theatre
of warfare. In the four years since, Cybertruck has swallowed much of
Musk’s focus as Tesla tried to bring the vehicle to fruition, which he
recently
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-28/tesla-cybertruck-delivery-event-preview-musk-warns-of-production-challenges?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">admitted</a>
has been a much bigger struggle than he anticipated. The first 10
Cybertrucks will finally be delivered to their very patient owners on
November 30.
</p>
<p>
In light of this misadventure, it’s worth asking: Is it time for Tesla
to get boring?
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
I am on record as saying
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-gmc-hummer" target="_self">Cybertruck
could succeed</a>. Despite the jeers of auto journalists and onlookers
who think Tesla’s truck is ill-conceived, poorly constructed, and, well,
stupid, it’s clear that Musk’s cult of personality will sell some of
these EVs. Plenty of buyers with the same man-boy fantasy of owning a
pointy tank as a daily driver will see the appeal. So will shoppers
whose main priority is feeling safe and protected on the highway.
</p>
<p>
Still, the case for the Cybertruck is eroding. Musk initially teased
single- and double-motor versions that would start at $40,000 and
$50,000, respectively, bringing the EV in well below the price of some
electric truck competitors. After all the time and trouble it took to
realize the Cybertuck, though, Tesla will reportedly begin sales by
offering only double- and triple-motor versions, and at prices
<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/tesla/cybertruck" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimated</a>
to be $70,000 to $80,000. That puts them on par with pricey trucks like
the Rivian R1T.
</p>
<p>
The biggest trouble with the Cybertruck, though, is the opportunity cost
of what Tesla could’ve been doing with all this time and industrial
energy. That’s not to say the EV maker is struggling, exactly — the
Model Y became the world’s best-selling car during this time, and Tesla
has revealed what will become the redesign of the very successful Model
3.
</p>
<p>
During the development of Cybertruck, however, Tesla seems to have
deprioritized the redesign of the Model X, which has looked basically
the same on the outside since 2015, for example. It has made slow
progress on the promise to build a truly affordable EV in the

range</a>, which could have entrenched for Tesla a leading position in
the entry-level EV market that will soon emerge. Tesla could’ve tried to
fill out its lineup with crossovers of other sizes, the way a boring
legacy company would have done to keep its huge advantage in market
share from slipping away. But Musk chased the shiny steel object
instead, allowing his rivals to get back into the game in the process.
</p>
<p>
Such is the tension inherent in any successful startup. The mercurial,
damn-the-torpedoes founder or CEO leads the firm to the promised land,
but somewhere along the way to true success comes the pressure to button
down and grow up, and to start making sound, sane business decisions
instead of building the Spruce Goose.
</p>
<p>
Musk himself seems to realize this, at times. He once
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-28/tesla-cybertruck-delivery-event-preview-musk-warns-of-production-challenges?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called</a>
the gullwing-doored Model X a “technology bandwagon” into which Tesla
poured all the whiz-bang technology ideas it could think of. This led to
an admittedly wild vehicle, but one that never sold in huge numbers. He
seemed to learn his lesson with the simpler and more affordable Model 3
and Y, which led to enormous sales numbers and made Tesla the most
valuable car brand in the world. Here in California, Teslas went from
exotic to ordinary. Every time I drive my Model 3 down the freeway,
there are at least two more within view.
</p>
<p>
But with those volume successes in hand, the devil on Musk’s shoulder
made itself heard once more. Musk’s obsession with making the exterior
from stainless steel led to long production delays. And Cybertruck
clearly follows the Model X pattern, with Tesla including every possible
feature from bulletproof windows to a slide-out tailgate for loading
your Tesla ATV in the back.
</p>
<p>
Maybe Musk got afraid of getting old and becoming boring. Maybe nobody
was around with the authority to tell him “no.” Maybe the Cybertruck,
once it emerges from its production quagmire, will be another rousing
success. But if it’s not, it will be remembered (along with Musk’s
ill-advised purchase of Twitter) as the vanity project that ate Tesla’s
attention right when it had the whole EV world by the tail.

<h2 id="world-leaders-react-to-kissinger-death">World Leaders React to
Kissinger Death</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>World leaders reacted to the death of Henry Kissinger, a former U.S.
secretary of state who influenced geopolitics under two presidents.</p>
<p>Kissinger died Wednesday at 100.</p>
<p>“Deeply shocked and saddened to learn of Dr. Kissinger’s passing at
100,” Xie Feng, China’s ambassador to the United States said in a post
on X, formerly known as twitter. “My deepest condolences go to Nancy
(Kissinger’s wife) and her family. It is a tremendous loss for both our
countries and the world. The history will remember what the centenarian
had contributed to China-U.S. relations, and he will always remain alive
in the hearts of the Chinese people as a most valued old friend.”</p>
<p>Kissinger made two trips to China before accompanying U.S. President
Richard Nixon on his groundbreaking visit to Beijing in 1972 to meet
with China’s Communist Party chairman, Mao Zedong. During the visit, the
United States and China formalized diplomatic relations after a break of
23 years.</p>
<p>In Japan, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida spoke of Kissinger’s role in
Asia, saying he was responsible for “significant contributions” to peace
and stability, in a post on X.</p>
<p>Kishida mentioned Kissinger’s work in China and added, “I’d like to
express my most sincere respect to the great achievements he made. I
also would like to offer my condolences.”</p>
<p>European Council President Charles Michel called Kissinger a
“strategist with attention to the smallest detail,” in another post on
X. He declared him “A kind human and a brilliant mind who, over 100
years, shaped the [destinies] of some of the most important events of
the century.”</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin called Kissinger “a wise and
farsighted statesman,” in a telegram to Kissinger’s widow, Nancy,
according to Reuters.</p>
<p>“America has lost one of the most dependable and distinctive voices”
on foreign affairs, said former President George W. Bush, striking a
tone shared by many high-level officials past and present.</p>
<p>“I have long admired the man who fled the Nazis as a young boy from a
Jewish family, then fought them in the United States Army,” Bush said in
a statement. “When he later became secretary of state, his appointment
as a former refugee said as much about his greatness as it did America’s
greatness.”</p>
<p>Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he was “in awe” of
Kissinger.</p>
<p>“Of course, like anyone who has confronted the most difficult
problems of international politics, he was criticized at times, even
denounced,” Blair said. “But I believe he was always motivated not from
a coarse ‘realpolitik,’ but from a genuine love of the free world and
the need to protect it. He was a problem solver, whether in respect of
the Cold War, the Middle East or China and its rise.”</p>
<p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog said as he met U.S. Secretary of State
Antony Blinken in Tel Aviv that Kissinger “laid the cornerstone of the
peace agreement, which (was) later signed with Egypt, and so many other
processes around the world I admire.”</p>
<p>Blinken said Kissinger “really set the standard for everyone who
followed in this job” and that he was “very privileged to get his
counsel many times, including as recently as about a month ago.”</p>
<p>“Few people were better students of history,” he said. “Even fewer
people did more to shape history than Henry Kissinger.”</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron wrote on X that “Henry Kissinger was
a giant of history. His century of ideas and of diplomacy had a lasting
influence on his time and on our world.”</p>
<p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz reflected on Kissinger’s impact on the
relationship between the U.S. and Germany, his native county. Kissinger
was a Jew who fled Nazi rule with his family in his teens.</p>
<p>“His commitment to the transatlantic friendship between the USA and
Germany was significant, and he always remained close to his German
homeland,” Chancellor Olaf Scholz wrote on X.</p>
<p>Some information in this report came from Reuters, Agence
France-Presse and The Associated Press.</p>

<p>date: 2023-11-30, from: Robert Reich on Substack</p>
<p>Friends, Henry Kissinger has died, at the age of 100. When a former
high government official as well known as Kissinger passes, the
conventional response is to say nice things about what they
accomplished. I’m sorry, but I cannot. In my humble opinion, Kissinger
should have been considered a war criminal.</p>

<h2 id="my-2023-spotify-wrapped">My 2023 Spotify Wrapped</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-30, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
OK, I bothered opening up Spotify on my phone to check out my actual
Wrapped. Fun discoveries:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
“Permanent wave” is apparently a genre that exists. And it’s my 3rd most
listened to this year.
</li>
<li>
Apparently the city whose music taste most closely resembles mine is
Perth 😆
</li>
<li>
I am in the top 0.1% of The Twilight Sad listeneners 👑
</li>
<li>
Placebo/their management <abbr title="Couldn't Be Fucked">CBF</abbr>
uploading a proper “artist message” but didn’t <em>just not</em> either,
so they uploaded a soundless compilation of clips from their concerts
</li>
<li>
Spotify labelled my listening pattern as “Hypnotist” because I “like to
play albums the whole way through”
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Because I use Last.fm there were no surprises with regard to my top
artists or anything. I think my favourite feature was the artist
messages, at least the ones who seemed earnest and not totally phoning
it in. I was excited Alexandra Savior said she had new music coming
“very, very soon”, because the other day I read a 2021 interview with
her where she said much the same thing and was like, “…where did it go?”
</p>
<p>
I guess next year should be back to my Spotify Wrapped being a bit more
surprising (read: not identical to my Last.fm stats) because I’m trying
to go back to cultivating my own music collection and listening to it
via Plexamp (but still using Spotify somewhat for breadth and
discovery). That’ll be a fun journey.

Kissinger, Former Top US Diplomat Under Nixon, Dies at 100</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Henry Kissinger, who died Wednesday at the age of 100, personified
U.S. foreign policy during the Nixon and Ford administrations, serving
as secretary of state under both presidents and inviting both praise for
his diplomatic successes and controversy for his calculating political
view of the world.</p>
<p>His death was announced by his consulting firm and no cause was
given.</p>
<p>Known for being a scholar, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and a prominent
refugee to the United States, Kissinger became a cultural icon,
inspiring myriad biographies, both favorable and not, and satirized by
the likes of Monty Python.</p>
<p>The conservative thinker helped to engineer a host of diplomatic
successes, including rapprochement with China and detente with the
Soviet Union. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize along with Le Duc Tho
of North Vietnam for their efforts to negotiate an end to the Vietnam
War.</p>
<p>Kissinger also had multiple achievements in the Middle East,
including negotiating the 1975 Sinai Accord between Egypt and Israel,
and working to advance the broader Arab-Israeli peace process in efforts
that became known as “shuttle diplomacy.”</p>
<p>Despite his achievements around the globe, Kissinger was a
controversial figure, with critics alleging he allowed carpet-bombing in
Cambodia, supported Pakistan’s crackdown on Bangladesh and did little to
stop Argentina’s campaign against dissidents.</p>
<p>Early years</p>
<p>Born Heinz Kissinger in Furth, Germany, he arrived in the United
States in 1938 at the age of 15 after his family fled the Nazi
persecution of Jews. The family spoke English at home, and Heinz became
known as Henry, later becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen.</p>
<p>Kissinger returned to Europe during World War II as a member of the
U.S. Army in the 84th Infantry Division.</p>
<p>“I look back at those years with great pride,” Kissinger told the
Chicago Tribune when he was in his 80s. “World War II was a war without
any moral ambiguity.”</p>
<p>Following the war, Kissinger enrolled at Harvard on the G.I. Bill,
and received his bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees from the
university, later joining the school’s faculty.</p>
<p>Kissinger’s view of foreign policy was no doubt shaped by his
experience of fleeing Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>He is known for his brand of “realpolitik” centered on making
practical diplomatic decisions rather than those rooted to a moral
framework.</p>
<p>When asked by The New York Times in 1974 about the sense of pessimism
and even tragedy in his political writings, Kissinger responded, “I
think of myself as a historian more than as a statesman. As a historian,
you have to be conscious of the fact that every civilization that has
ever existed has ultimately collapsed.”</p>
<p>“History is a tale of efforts that failed, of aspirations that
weren’t realized, of wishes that were fulfilled and then turned out to
be different from what one expected,” he said.</p>
<p>White House roles</p>
<p>After serving as a consultant to U.S. government agencies during the
Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson administrations, Kissinger joined the
White House in 1969 during the Nixon administration. He served as
national security adviser and then secretary of state and continued as
secretary of state under President Gerald Ford.</p>
<p>Kissinger had a close relationship with President Richard Nixon and
credited the collaboration as a major reason for their foreign policy
successes.</p>
<p>He told Newsweek in 2009, “I saw the president every day when we were
both in town because I felt it was absolutely essential that we thought
along the same lines. I was lucky. I had extraordinarily close
relationships with the two presidents I served. In fact, if one looks at
the history of the secretaries of state, it’s rare,” he said.</p>
<p>Kissinger made two trips to China before accompanying Nixon on his
groundbreaking visit to Beijing in 1972 to meet with China’s Communist
Party chairman, Mao Zedong. During the visit, the United States and
China formalized diplomatic relations after a break of 23 years.</p>
<p>Kissinger and Nixon also worked closely together to defuse tensions
with the Soviet Union, resulting in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks
(SALT) as well as the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty.</p>
<p>The top U.S. diplomat received numerous awards for his
accomplishments. Along with the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973, he earned the
Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977, the United States’ highest
civilian honor, and the Medal of Liberty in 1986, which was given to 10
of America’s most influential foreign-born leaders.</p>
<p>Controversies</p>
<p>Despite his accomplishments, Kissinger has attracted plenty of
criticism, much of it centered on his actions during the Vietnam
War.</p>
<p>Kissinger kept secret the U.S. bombings of Cambodia and Laos in 1969
– which helped to escalate the Vietnam War – failing to inform Congress
or the American public about them.</p>
<p>He also was given power by Nixon to conduct secret negotiations with
the North Vietnamese. While Kissinger eventually helped broker the Paris
Peace Accords as a result of the negotiations, his critics say the years
of secretive talks only prolonged the war.</p>
<p>Kissinger has also been criticized for his role in conflicts around
the world, including Angola’s civil war, which developed into a Cold War
battleground, and the U.S. involvement in Chile, which culminated in a
coup in 1973.</p>
<p>While Kissinger stayed on in his role as secretary of state after
Nixon resigned in disgrace in 1974, he was not left unscathed by the
Watergate scandal that took Nixon from office. The scandal revealed that
Kissinger had ordered the FBI to wiretap members of the National
Security Council to see who had leaked news of the U.S. bombing of
Cambodia to the news media.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Post White House</p>
<p>After leaving the government, Kissinger worked as an international
consultant and lecturer, as well as author, writing more than a dozen
books. His latest, “Leadership,” was published when he was 99.</p>
<p>He continued to speak and write about foreign affairs, even provoking
controversy in May 2022 when he argued at the World Economic Forum in
Davos, Switzerland, that Ukraine should cede territory to make peace
with Russia. He said an embarrassing defeat for Russian President
Vladimir Putin could worsen Europe’s long-term stability.</p>
<p>Kissinger is survived by his second wife, Nancy, whom he married in
1974. He had two children with his first wife, Ann Fleischer, and five
grandchildren.</p>

President Harris to Lead US Delegation to Major Climate Summit</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris will lead the U.S. delegation to the
world’s premier climate summit, the White House said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The White House stressed that President Joe Biden considers the
climate crisis among his top four priorities, but the recent conflict
between Israel and Hamas has consumed much of his time and
attention.</p>
<p>“Throughout her engagements, the vice president will underscore the
Biden-Harris administration’s success in delivering on the most
ambitious climate agenda in history, both at home and abroad,” said
Kirsten Allen, the vice president’s press secretary.</p>
<p>Harris will lead dozens of top U.S. officials, including special
presidential envoy for climate John Kerry and others from more than 20
agencies and departments, the White House said.</p>
<p>This year’s U.N. Climate Change Conference of the Parties — known as
COP28 because it is the 28th gathering of its kind — will be hosted by
United Arab Emirates President Mohamed bin Zayed. The royal, who took
office after the 2022 death of his brother, is also chairman of the
Supreme Petroleum Council, the Emirate of Abu Dhabi’s top governing body
for oil, gas and related industries.</p>
<p>Nearly 200 countries represented</p>
<p>More than 70,000 delegates from nearly 200 countries are beginning to
converge on the city of Dubai, which has seen a meteoric rise from its
fishing village roots, thanks to its massive oil wealth.</p>
<p>There, in a city known for its artificial archipelago and hyperluxury
shopping offerings inside a mall that covers more than 50 soccer fields
and contains an indoor ski slope and a colony of penguins, they will
assess the progress toward the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5
degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</p>
<p>In a statement, Biden said Harris would “showcase U.S. global
leadership on climate at home and abroad” and would “help galvanize
increased global ambition at this critical event.”</p>
<p>She will attend meetings Friday and Saturday in Dubai.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, when asked why Biden was not attending the summit,
John Kirby, director of strategic communications at the National
Security Council, said Biden was “more than capable” of handling his
many responsibilities, but that the Mideast conflict had “obviously”
been a recent focus.</p>
<p>‘Race to the top’</p>
<p>VOA on Wednesday asked White House national climate adviser Ali Zaidi
whether the United States would push for a deal to commit countries to
phase out fossil fuels by a certain date. In September, leaders of the
world’s 20 largest economies failed to agree on this issue.</p>
<p>Washington, Zaidi replied, seeks to “phase down the emissions that
come from the unabated burning of fossil fuels.”</p>
<p>That word — unabated — may be a sticking point in this year’s
declaration, as it would permit the opening of new fossil fuel plants if
they have thus far unproven technology meant to capture and store carbon
emissions.</p>
<p>Already, an intergovernmental group of 117 countries has questioned
that language and has indicated opposition to its inclusion.</p>
<p>“The emission abatement technologies which currently only exist at
limited scale have a minor role to play to reduce emissions mainly from
hard to abate sectors,” the High Ambition Coalition for Nature and
People said in a statement signed by ministers from 16 countries,
including Austria, Ethiopia and France. “However, they should not be
used to delay climate action in sectors such as electricity generation
where feasible, effective and cost-efficient mitigation alternatives are
available, particularly in this critical decade when emissions need to
be reduced urgently and dramatically.”</p>
<p>Zaidi also pointed out Biden’s role in passing a significant climate
law, the Inflation Reduction Act, which commits at least $370 billion to
clean energy over the next 10 years — something Harris will also
emphasize at the gathering, administration officials told reporters in a
briefing on the matter on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“This is a race to the top, hopefully, for clean energy,” Zaidi told
VOA. “We want to lead that race, and the good news is the more countries
that join that race, the better off we’ll be in tackling these
emissions. We need countries like China and other major economies to be
the ones that reduce emissions in a major way. We’re doing that here at
home.”</p>

id="hamas-hostage-families-urge-us-lawmakers-to-continue-negotiations">Hamas
Hostage Families Urge US Lawmakers to Continue Negotiations</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Families of hostages still held by Hamas urged U.S. lawmakers
Wednesday not to let up on negotiations for their release.</p>
<p>The Israeli government said 12 hostages were released from captivity
in Gaza on Wednesday, the sixth release of hostages during a negotiated
cease-fire that international negotiators were working to extend.</p>
<p>“The release of these hostages has been a cause for hope,” Senate
Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ben Cardin said in a statement
Wednesday. “And we are equally encouraged by the lifesaving aid that has
reached innocent Palestinians who are also victims of Hamas’ cruelty.
But we must not allow complacency to deter us in our shared mission to
bring home the other hostages held by Hamas, including American
citizens.”</p>
<p>Hamas has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., U.K,
EU and others.</p>
<p>An estimated 240 hostages were seized when Hamas attacked Israel on
October 7, beginning the conflict. Of those, almost 100 have been
released over the past six days.</p>
<p>“Keep the pressure on Qatar. Keep the pressure on Egypt. Rally the
international community to use any resources they have. Get this done,”
said Orna Neutra, mother of hostage Omer Neutra.</p>
<p>Omer Neutra, a dual Israeli American citizen serving in the Israel
Defense Forces, is believed to have been held in captivity for more than
50 days.</p>
<p>House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul said he
viewed footage of the October 7 attack last week in Israel with Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen the prime minister — who is a very stoic, strong man
— driven to tears, watching his own people being killed in such a
horrific manner: the rapes and the beheadings and the slaughter of
innocent Jewish people. He will not rest until [Hamas is] eradicated,
not just for the Jewish people but for the Palestinians,” McCaul said at
a roundtable meeting with families of the hostages on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>Congress passed a resolution Tuesday calling on Hamas to release all
hostages and condemning the October 7 attack by a vote of 414-0. A
second resolution affirming Israel’s right to exist passed 412-1-1.
Democratic Representative Rashida Tlaib, who has faced criticism for her
comments about Israel, voted present. Republican Representative Thomas
Massie voted no.</p>
<p>“We will not relent. We will not stop. We will not forget. We will
continue to work. We will put politics aside until your hope becomes a
reality of the return of your love,” said Representative Gregory Meeks,
the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday, only one American hostage had been freed.</p>
<p>Ruby Chen, father of hostage Itay Chen, who is also an Israeli
soldier, told lawmakers, “This is not a U.S. issue. It’s an
international community humanitarian issue that all of the international
community needs to get behind in order to solve this problem.”</p>
<p>Liz Hirsh Naftali, great-aunt of recently released 3-year-old Abigail
Edan, told lawmakers, “Abigail is home. Not in her home, but she is home
in Israel because her home is destroyed. They can’t return to where they
lived. She has no parents to go home to.”</p>
<p>Edan’s parents were killed by Hamas during the October 7 attack.</p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers have struggled to agree on the White House’s request
for $13.6 billion in aid to Israel. Earlier this month, the
Democratic-majority Senate did not take up legislation passed in the
Republican-majority House of Representatives that paid for aid to Israel
with budget cuts to the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p>The Senate is working on a deal for Republicans’ request for billions
of dollars in border security funding in return for the votes needed to
pass aid to both Ukraine and Israel.</p>

House Hopes to Lead Global Charge in ‘Promise, Peril’ of Emerging Tech
Like AI</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>American leadership is essential in establishing norms and laws to
“determine how we both glean the promise and manage the peril” of
emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and digital economic
and social platforms used to connect billions of people around the
world, a White House adviser told VOA.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has rolled out a number of initiatives on
the topic — most recently, an executive order that aims to set new AI
safety and security standards. That order relies on cooperation from
private developers and other countries, “because the attackers are in
one set of countries, the infrastructure is in another and the victims
are global,” said Anne Neuberger, deputy national security adviser for
cyber and emerging technology at the National Security Council.</p>
<p>Neuberger sat down with VOA White House Correspondent Anita Powell to
explain these complex, compelling technologies and how she thinks they
have exposed the worst but also the best in humanity.</p>
<p>The following has been edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p>VOA: Thank you so much for sitting down with VOA today. Can you walk
us through the concrete outcomes of the recent meeting between President
Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping in the areas you cover —
cybersecurity, AI and the digital economy?</p>
<p>Anne Neuberger, White House deputy national security adviser: Of
course, strategic technologies are very important to both of our
countries’ growth and national security — and we’re global players on a
global stage. The most important part of the discussion was two leaders
coming together to say: While we are in competition, we’re committed to
working together on areas where we can collaborate - areas like climate
change, like discussions of what are the rules for artificial
intelligence.</p>
<p>VOA: Would you assess that the meeting made any progress, especially
on AI regulation?</p>
<p>Neuberger: Certainly very good discussions related to an agreement
for the countries to sit down and establish a working group on AI
[about] appropriate guardrails and guidelines in this area.</p>
<p>VOA: I’m going to stick with AI and the administration’s recent
moves, like the AI Bill of Rights and also the attempt to set some norms
at the recent London summit on AI. Why does the administration think
U.S. leadership matters so much here?</p>
<p>Neuberger: For two reasons. First, the United States is a committed
democracy and AI is a major technology that brings both promise and
peril. It is up to us to determine how we both glean the promise and
manage the peril. President Biden has made that clear in his
game-changing executive order that, as a country, we must manage the
perils in order to glean the promise.</p>
<p>VOA: Speaking of the perils of AI, what is the administration doing
to prevent the malicious use of generative AI in both conflicts and
contests? I’m talking about conflicts like Israel and Ukraine, but also
contests like the upcoming elections in Congo, in Taiwan and here in the
United States.</p>
<p>Neuberger: We’ve seen new AI models that generate very realistic
videos, very realistic images. In terms of generative AI related to
elections, I want to lift up one of the voluntary commitments that the
president negotiated, which was around watermarking: having a visible
and potentially invisible mark on an AI-generated image or video that
notes that this is AI-generated, to alert a viewer. An invisible mark
could be used so that, even if there are attempts to remove this mark,
the platforms themselves can still be able to portray that message and
help educate individuals. This is still an area of evolving technology.
It’s getting better and better. But companies made commitments to start
marking content that they generate. And I know a number of social media
platforms are also making commitments to ensure that they display
messages to help consumers who see such content know that it is
generated by artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>VOA: Moving on to cybersecurity and malign actors like North Korea
and Russia, what is the administration doing to curb their work in this
area?</p>
<p>Neuberger: We see North Korea really using cyberattacks as a way to
get money because they’re such a heavily sanctioned regime. So North
Korea moved from targeting banks to targeting … cryptocurrency
infrastructure around the world. And the White House has had a focused
effort to bring together all elements we have to fight that with
Treasury Department designations.</p>
<p>There’ll be further designations coming up for the cryptocurrency
mixers that launder funds stolen from those cryptocurrency
infrastructures. We also have been working with the industry to press
them to improve the cybersecurity of their systems as well as law
enforcement. U.S. law enforcement has been cooperating with partners
around the world to take down that server infrastructure and to arrest
the individuals who are responsible for some of this activity.</p>
<p>VOA: Tell us a little bit about the counter-ransomware initiative
you’re working on.</p>
<p>Neuberger: Absolutely. Essentially, criminal groups, many of which
are based in Russia with infrastructure operating from around the world,
are locking systems … in order to request that the system owners pay
ransom. In the United States alone in the last two years, $2.3 billion
was paid in ransom. It’s a fundamentally transnational fight. … What
we’ve done is assemble 48 countries, Interpol [and] the European Union
to take this on together, because we know that the attackers are in one
set of countries, the infrastructure is in another, and the victims are
global. As the White House built this initiative, we ensure that the
leadership is diverse.</p>
<p>So, for example, the leaders of the effort to build capacity around
the world are Nigeria and Germany — intentionally, a country from Africa
and a country from Europe, because their needs are different. And we
wanted to ensure that as we’re helping countries build the capacity to
fight this, we’re sensitive to the different needs of a country like
Nigeria, like Rwanda, like South Africa, like Indonesia. Similarly,
there’s an effort focused on exercising information, sharing information
together.</p>
<p>You asked about the key deliverables from this most recent meeting.
I’ll note three big ones. First, we launched a website and a system
where countries can collaborate when they’re fighting a ransomware
attack, where they can ask for help [or] learn from others who fought a
similar attack. Second, we made the first ever joint policy statement —
a big deal — 48 countries committing that countries themselves will not
pay ransoms, because we know this is a financially driven problem. And
third, the United States committed that we would be sharing bad wallets
[that] criminals are using to move money around the world so other
countries can help stop that money as it moves as well. So that’s an
example of three of the many commitments that came out of the recent
meeting.</p>
<p>VOA: Let’s talk about the Global South, which has pioneered
development of really interesting digital economic technologies like
Kenya’s M-PESA, which was rolled out in, like, 2007. Now the U.S. has
Venmo, which is modeled on that. How is the U.S. learning from the
developing world in the development of these projects and also the
perils of these products?</p>
<p>Neuberger: M-PESA is a fantastic example of the promise of digital
tech. Essentially, Kenya took the fact that they had a telecom
infrastructure, and built their banking infrastructure riding on that,
so they leapt ahead to enable people across the country to do
transactions online. When you look at Ukraine in the context of Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine, Ukraine quickly moved their government online,
really building on lessons learned from Estonia, to enable Ukrainians —
many who are in Poland and Hungary — to continue to engage with their
government in a digital way.</p>
<p>The U.S. Agency for International Development is tremendously proud
of that Ukrainian project and is using it as a model as we look to other
countries around the world. So we’re learning a lot from the creativity
and innovation; what we want to bring to that is American development,
skill and aid, and also plugging in American tech companies who can
accelerate the rollout of these projects in countries around the world,
because we still believe in the promise of digital. But you mentioned
the peril, and that’s where cybersecurity comes in.</p>
<p>VOA: This lines us up perfectly for my final question, about the
promise and the peril. In the digital world, people can hide behind
anonymity and say and do awful things using tools that were meant to
improve the world. How do you keep your faith in humanity?</p>
<p>Neuberger: It’s a tremendously important question. It’s one that’s
personally important to me. My great-grandparents lost their lives in
Nazi death camps. And those members of my family who survived — some
survived through the horrors of the camp, some managed to hide out under
false identities. And I often think that the promise of digital has also
made our identities very evident. Sometimes when I’m just browsing
Amazon online, and it recommends a set of books, I think to myself: I
wonder how I’d hide if what happened to my grandparents came for me. So
as a result, I think that even as we engage with these technologies, we
have to ensure that vulnerable populations are protected.</p>
<p>So, the president’s working with AI companies to say companies have
an obligation to protect vulnerable populations online, to ensure that
we’re using AI to detect where there’s bullying online, where there’s
hate speech that goes against common practices that needs to be
addressed; where there are AI-generated images related to children or
women or other vulnerable populations, that we use AI to find them and
remove them; and certainly use law enforcement and the power of law
enforcement partnerships around the world to deter that as well. Freedom
of speech is a part of free societies. Freedom from harm needs to be a
fight we take on together.</p>
<p>VOA: Thank you so much for speaking to our audience.</p>
<p>Neuberger: Thank you.</p>

Life Expectancy Climbs, but Remains Below Pre-Pandemic Levels</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Life expectancy in the United States is on the rise but remains lower
than it was in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic, as a host of
other factors contributing to mortality, including chronic disease, gun
violence and a persistent epidemic of overdose deaths, continue to
plague the country.</p>
<p>According to data released by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention on Wednesday, an American born in 2022 could expect to live
77.5 years on average, up 1.1 years from 2021, with most of the
improvement accounted for by the reduction in COVID-19 deaths.</p>
<p>However, as recently as 2019, the year before the pandemic began in
earnest, the average life expectancy in the U.S. was 78.8 years. While
some other countries with advanced economies and modern health care
infrastructure have seen their life expectancy rates return to
pre-pandemic levels, the U.S. still lags behind.</p>
<p>There are also wide gaps in life expectancy across demographic groups
in the U.S. Women, for example, had a life expectancy of 80.2 years in
2022, compared to just 74.8 years for men.</p>
<p>Asian Americans born in 2022 could expect to live 84.5 years, and
Hispanic Americans of any race had a life expectancy of 80 years. White
Americans matched the overall average at 77.5 years, while Black
Americans could expect to live 72.8 years. The lowest life expectancy
reported by the CDC was for American Indian and Alaska Native Americans,
at 67.9 years.</p>
<p>Behind peer countries</p>
<p>“There’s both good and bad news here,” Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency
physician and a professor of public health at The George Washington
University, told VOA.</p>
<p>“It’s disappointing that life expectancy has not rebounded more
following the worst of COVID,” Wen said. “But that said, life expectancy
in 2022 did rise by more than a full year. And it’s thought that more
than 80% of this positive increase was attributed to a drop in COVID-19
deaths.</p>
<p>“Even before COVID, the U.S. was already behind our peer countries
when it came to life expectancy,” she added. “Even without COVID,
improvements in life expectancy have been stagnating in the U.S. over
the last decade. So it’s not surprising, then, that we would not have as
robust of a rebound as other countries. We need to improve our health
care infrastructure in this country, especially when it comes to
preventing illnesses and addressing chronic diseases.”</p>
<p>In much of Europe, as well as in developed economies in Asia,
including Japan and South Korea, life expectancy is significantly above
80 years for the average person.</p>
<p>Coronavirus still matters</p>
<p>While coronavirus deaths are down to just a fraction of what they
were in 2020 and 2021, the disease still presents a serious threat to
the lives of many Americans, especially because the widespread existence
of chronic diseases common to U.S. adults make dying from an infection
more likely.</p>
<p>Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, director of the Bloomberg American Health
Initiative at Johns Hopkins University, told VOA that the country could
still be doing more to limit deaths from coronavirus infections,
including by encouraging more Americans to get vaccinated against the
disease.</p>
<p>However, he said the threat from the pandemic represents only part of
the troubles facing U.S. public health officials.</p>
<p>“There are many challenges to American health beyond COVID,”
Sharfstein said. “So, we have a ways to go, and many of those challenges
got worse during the pandemic.”</p>
<p>In addition to improving preventive care for respiratory illnesses,
Sharfstein’s organization has called for concerted action by the
government to address overdose deaths, suicides, gun violence, motor
vehicle crashes, heat-related deaths, as well as heart disease, stroke
and diabetes.</p>
<p>Change by demographic group</p>
<p>While all of the demographic groups tracked by the CDC saw their life
expectancies rise between 2021 and 2022, the increase varied
significantly.</p>
<p>The American Indian and Alaskan Native cohort experienced the largest
year-over-year boost in life expectancy of 2.4 years for men and 2.1
years for women. However, that same group experienced the most severe
decline in life expectancy during the pandemic, a loss of 6.2 years
between 2019 and 2021.</p>
<p>Hispanic Americans had the next largest gain in 2022, with life
expectancy for men rising by 2.4 years and for women by 1.7 years. The
group as a whole saw life expectancy drop by 4.1 years between 2019 and
2021.</p>
<p>For Black men and Black women, the average life expectancy increased
by 1.5 years in 2022. As a group, Black Americans experienced an overall
decline in life expectancy of 3.6 years during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Male Asian Americans saw their life expectancy increase by 1.2 years
in 2022, with Asian American women seeing an increase of 0.7 years.
Asian Americans as a group saw life expectancy decline by 2.1 years from
2019 to 2022.</p>
<p>As a group, White Americans had the smallest rebound in life
expectancy last year, with men charting a gain of 1.1 years and women
0.6 years. As a group, White Americans lost 2.1 years of life expectancy
between 2019 and 2022.</p>

<p>
So I’m doing the “let the Spotify DJ walk you through your 2023 Wrapped”
thing, and the very first song was… Interpol’s “Leif Erikson”, which I
think I would’ve listened to exactly two times all year (when I listened
to the whole album) if Spotify didn’t insist on cramming it into every
single “songs it goes on to when an album finishes” set.
</p>
<p>
Also, so far, every other one of my “top songs” this year has been by
Interpol too. But maybe that’s just the DJ organising my “top songs” by
artist or something. Interpol still isn’t exactly where I’d have
started, though (they rank 7th for my year up to 15 Nov, according to
Last.fm).

Exploits US-China Divide on Critical Minerals</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden will not be attending the 28th United
Nations Climate Change Conference, or COP 28. But U.S. diplomats will be
there, interested in getting access to the critical mineral exports
necessary to transition to green energy. VOA’s Jessica Stone
reports.</p>

<h2

Some DACA Recipients, Leaving US Only Way to Escape Legal Limbo</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>In 2020, Tawheeda Wahabzada had had enough. It was time to leave the
country she’d grown up in.</p>
<p>“The idea of leaving has always been at the back of my mind. … It was
a constant reminder that this is temporary, and I felt I wasn’t able to
live a meaningful life because of my status,” she said.</p>
<p>Wahabzada is one of a growing number of young immigrants brought to
the United States as children who do not want to live in legal limbo
anymore. She, like millions of other immigrants who entered the country
without permission or overstayed their visas, has no path to
citizenship.</p>
<p>The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, was
created in 2012 under the Obama administration to give undocumented
immigrants some administrative relief by allowing them to do things such
as apply for work permits and obtain driver’s licenses.</p>
<p>However, the program faced continual challenges in court, and in 2017
the Trump administration announced it would dismantle the program.</p>
<p>For some DACA recipients, it was time to stop dreaming of a future in
the U.S. Wahabzada moved to Canada in 2020, where she is a citizen and
can continue working at an international nongovernmental
organization.</p>
<p>About a year later, she found two other DACA recipients, Eun Suk
“Jason” Hong and Monzy Hernandez, online.</p>
<p>“I actually first reached out to Jason on LinkedIn, and then through
Jason, I met Monzy,” Wahabzada said in an email. “We’ve instantly
connected as if we’ve known each other for a while. Then we realized how
this isn’t just our problem, but a lot more people are experiencing
similar, if not the same, issues. So we’ve decided to create a small,
exclusive community on Facebook which later turned into ONWARD.”</p>
<p>According to ONWARD, there is a growing movement of young adults in
the U.S. who are unable to get citizenship and are hoping to start anew
elsewhere.</p>
<p>“We don’t give legal advice, but we share our experiences. … We
connect people,” Wahabzada said. The group started out with a few
hundred followers; now it has about 1,500.</p>
<p>Life in the U.S.</p>
<p>Wahabzada had a “very American” upbringing. Her parents were refugees
who originally relocated from Afghanistan to Canada in 1990, where she
was born.</p>
<p>“It was very difficult for my parents to have stable jobs. We were
very low-income, and we didn’t really have close immediate family near
us. … They’ve had careers and degrees from their past lives … but they
couldn’t use those skills,” she said.</p>
<p>In 1995, her family moved to Carson City, Nevada, where they had
relatives.</p>
<p>“They thought it was easier for them to be closer to family and to
work with family — to have support and more opportunities that way,” she
said.</p>
<p>Wahabzada learned she was undocumented when she was nearly 16.</p>
<p>“I remember dragging [my mother] with me, and when I was at the DMV,
the person at the DMV was like ‘You don’t have the necessary documents
to apply for a learner’s permit.’ … And that’s how my mom told me about
the reality of my status,” she said.</p>
<p>She went on to college, graduating from the University of Nevada,
Reno, and earning a master’s degree in global policy studies from the
University of Texas at Austin. Her family and private scholarships
helped her pay for her education.</p>
<p>After college, she lived in Washington and worked as a data and
policy analyst for a nonprofit, Open Data Watch.</p>
<p>Hong, meanwhile, was born in South Korea, brought to the U.S. by his
mother when he was 10, and raised in Montclair, New Jersey.</p>
<p>Growing up in the U.S., he did not feel any different than his
U.S.-born friends. “I was just having fun with other Americans. … [My
friends and I] enjoyed the same hobbies, same food,” he said.</p>
<p>But he knew something was different.</p>
<p>“I did have a little bit more awareness of what’s going on. I didn’t
know what exactly it meant, right? The only thing I knew was that my mom
was struggling to get permanent residency for us and for herself,” he
said.</p>
<p>Like Wahabzada, Hong lived in a state where undocumented students
could attend college.</p>
<p>“The idea of going to college was just joyous. … I think the first
year of my university was when things were really upside down, where I
really understood the impact [of my status] because starting from
freshman year in college in the U.S., people were already applying for
internships. And that’s when it hit big,” Hong said.</p>
<p>DACA</p>
<p>Wahabzada felt stuck and lonely. She was in college, and two of her
friends knew her status but, “They didn’t know the extent of how bad it
was,” she said, of being undocumented — “illegal” in the words of
activists who want to reduce immigration to the U.S.</p>
<p>The introduction of DACA, Wahabzada said, changed her life.</p>
<p>“When the application for DACA was available in August [2012], I
immediately started applying,” she said. After she entered the program,
she could get a driver’s license and a job, among other things.</p>
<p>It changed Hong’s life as well. He became a DACA recipient during his
senior year of college. With DACA, he could work.</p>
<p>He graduated from Binghamton University in New York with a degree in
finance, moved to New York City and worked as a financial service
representative at a New York insurance company. He also worked for an
immigration advocacy nonprofit.</p>
<p>Then the Trump administration announced it would end DACA.</p>
<p>“I had a meltdown at the time,” Hong said. “That’s when I first
realized, ‘What kind of future can I build?’”</p>
<p>In 2020, Hong was recognized by Binghamton University for his work
advocating for dreamers and DACA recipients. Among other things, the
university sent him a pamphlet about graduate school in Spain.</p>
<p>“Spain. I never thought about the option of leaving the United
States. My mom pretty much sacrificed all of her things for this so I
can have a life here,” he said.</p>
<p>In the end, Spain offered a future, and he decided to give up
DACA.</p>
<p>“I could not put myself through this anymore,” Hong said. He was 29,
his friends were getting promoted, marrying and having families. He felt
stuck.</p>
<p>Wahabzada was coming to the same conclusion.</p>
<p>“In August [2019], I published an Op-Ed in the New York Times about
the consequences of leaving the U.S. … I spent a lot of time with my
family, and in January 2020 I had a self-deportation party,” she
said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A way forward</p>
<p>Hong moved to Spain on a student visa to attend graduate school in
2020.</p>
<p>“Up until I was walking toward the plane, I was like, ‘This is really
happening.’ And then I got into the plane, that’s when it really hit
[me] … ‘I’m leaving my home for my own future,’” he said.</p>
<p>After graduation, Hong received an entrepreneurship visa and launched
his own business in Madrid.</p>
<p>While his mother returned to South Korea, she has since visited him
in his new home.</p>
<p>After two years in Canada, Wahabzada was able to obtain a waiver to
visit her family or for short work trips to Washington.</p>
<p>Leaving the U.S., she said, was really hard, and she still
grieves.</p>
<p>“A lot of grief. A lot of loneliness,” she said.</p>
<p>Hong estimated that about 2,000 DACA recipients have made the journey
out of the U.S., and that more than 1,000 are considering leaving the
country.</p>
<p>The U.S. is losing potential leaders who understand resilience,
empathy and compassion, Hong and Wahabzada said.</p>
<p>“The United States lost an ambitious, passionate young entrepreneur
who wants to create jobs, who wants to help the community. … If there is
something that America has lost, it is that kind of individual,” Wong
said.</p>

<h2 id="hello-from-dubai-where-the-fleece-quotient-is-high">Hello from
Dubai, Where the Fleece Quotient Is High</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-29, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDU5OTY5NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcwNzY1NzIwMH0.0u6af9ElDW-0ADtxHpmIBMXEiyqfnK_PscPNtELksjo/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"></a><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"></a><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"></a>One
tool I have developed in my years of climate reporting might be
described as the fleece quotient. This is the idea that you can
generally predict if something is a climate <em>event</em> — a category
I consider in its broadest terms, including but not limited to a
scientific conference, a protest, or an international meeting — if more
people attending it are wearing fleece than not. (It is distinct but
related to the Patagonia ratio.)
</p>
<p>
This methodology is not perfect: In some cities, one can accidentally
trip the fleece quotient on an ordinary Back to School night or even
during a Sunday afternoon shop at Costco. And a true accounting of the
fleece quotient (F.Q.) requires being attuned to microdemographic
vagaries: If a fleece item is adorned with a third-party corporate logo,
for instance, it is disqualified; but if it has an academic
institution’s logo, then it counts twice. (If it’s embroidered with a
major foundation’s logo? That’s five points, easy.)
</p>
<p>
But I have found it to be generally robust. In San Francisco (a
fleece-friendly place to begin with), it is possible to tell when 25,000
Earth scientists arrive for their large annual conference because the
city’s fleece quotient slightly but perceptibly rises.
</p>
<p>
This is all to say: Last night, I boarded a long-haul flight from Newark
that had a fleece quotient to rival that of the Seattle REI. It was, of
course, filled with people headed to the United Nations’ annual climate
conference in Dubai — that is, the 28<sup>th</sup> annual meeting of the
Conference of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate
Change, or COP28.
</p>
<p>
For the next week or so, I’ll be attending the conference and writing
notes about what I see. (COP itself runs to December 12.) I’ll also be
trying to decode and filter
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop-28-climate-news-week" target="_self">the
daily flood of climate news</a> that tends to characterize this week.
COP is the one moment every year when the world focuses on climate
change — and as I think we’ll see this week, that can be both for good
and for ill.

I’m excited to write these notes over the coming days. If you’d like to

id="rosalynn-carters-intimate-funeral-held-in-town-where-she-and-her-husband-were-born">Rosalynn
Carter’s Intimate Funeral Held in Town Where She and Her Husband Were
Born</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>With her frail husband as a silent witness, Rosalynn Carter was
celebrated by her family and closest friends Wednesday at her funeral in
the same tiny town where she and Jimmy Carter were born, forever their
home base as they climbed to the White House and traveled the world for
humanitarian causes.</p>
<p>The former first lady, who died November 19 at the age of 96, had her
intimate funeral at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, where she and
her husband spent decades welcoming guests and where a wooden cross
Jimmy Carter fashioned in his woodshop is displayed. Earlier tributes
were held in nearby Americus and in Atlanta.</p>
<p>The former president was in attendance in his wheelchair, with her
one last time in his life.</p>
<p>Maranatha Pastor Tony Lowden opened the service with a tribute to
“the life and legacy of the greatest first lady.”</p>
<p>Rosalynn Carter wasn’t “just the first lady of the White House,” he
told the gathering. “She served every nation around the world.”</p>
<p>The pastor, describing her competitive streak, spoke to the mourners
in what he imagined to be the voice of Rosalynn Carter: “She would say
to you today, ‘don’t grieve for me, for now I’m free. … Jimmy tried to
beat me here. I got here first. I won the prize. Tell him I beat him and
I’m waiting on him.’”</p>
<p>“But,” Lowden continued, “she would say ‘don’t stop. There’s too many
homeless people in the world. There’s still too many people who don’t
have equal rights.’ … She would tell you don’t stop. Become that
virtuous woman. And men, if you’re listening, make room for the virtuous
woman.”</p>
<p>She will be buried in a plot she will one day share with her husband
of 77 years. The former president, now 99, left home hospice care to
attend Tuesday’s memorial, where two other presidents and all the living
first ladies joined the extended Carter family, as well as Wednesday’s
more intimate hometown funeral.</p>
<p>Vernita Sampson, a school bus driver and Plains native, drove a group
of area high school students, all wearing Future Farmer of America
jackets, to downtown Plains to pay tribute to the former first lady and
soak up the history of the day.</p>
<p>“They were people you could relate to, not this high standard where
they were up here and, you know, we’re all down there,” said Sampson,
58. “We never get used to death, no matter who we are or how long you
have lived,” but she said she and the students came “to celebrate that
she did live a long life, a very happy and productive life, that gives
you joy.”</p>
<p>At the service, the mourning came with affectionate stories of life
with Rosalynn Carter and some laughs.</p>
<p>“It occurs to me that dad got used to mom disagreeing with him
because she was really good at it,” son Jack Carter said. “And she
became a partner in the true sense of the word, where they had equal
footing.”</p>
<p>Jimmy Carter met his future wife only a few days after her mother
delivered her.</p>
<p>“She was born just a few years after women got the right to vote in
this small town in the South where people were still plowing their
fields behind mules,” grandson Jason Carter said during the memorial
service Tuesday at Atlanta’s Glenn Memorial Church.</p>
<p>Coming from that town of about 600 — then and now — Rosalynn Carter
changed lives across America and the developing world, her grandson
said. Jimmy Carter’s closest political adviser and a political force in
her own right, she advocated for better mental health care and
underappreciated caregivers in millions of U.S. households. Traveling
overseas, she fought disease, famine, and the abuse of women and
girls.</p>
<p>The Atlanta events reflected the grandest chapters of Rosalynn
Carter’s life. Mourners viewed her casket steps from The Carter Center
she and her husband co-founded after leaving the White House, then she
was honored at a service filled with the music of a symphony chorus, a
majestic pipe organ and fellow Habitat for Humanity ambassadors Garth
Brooks and Trisha Yearwood. President Joe Biden, former President Bill
Clinton and the first ladies joined Jimmy Carter and their four children
in the front row, in front of more than 1,000 congregants in suits, ties
and dresses.</p>
<p>Church members, who were included in the invitation-only ceremony,
rarely talk of “President Carter” or “Mrs. Carter.” They are supporting
“Mr. Jimmy” as he grieves for “Ms. Rosalynn.”</p>
<p>Lowden, the Carters’ longtime friend and personal minister, also
officiated Tuesday, emphasizing that Rosalynn Carter’s work, from the
Georgia statehouse when Jimmy Carter was governor to the 120-plus
countries that she visited, was an extension of her faith.</p>
<p>After the funeral, her children, grandchildren and
great-grandchildren walked alongside an SUV carrying Jimmy Carter as
Rosalynn Carter was carried from Marantha for the last time through the
town where she lived for more than 80 of her 96 years.</p>
<p>The motorcade passed holiday lights and decorations including a photo
collage in front of the downtown tree featuring the “First Lady of
Plains.”</p>
<p>The route also included the old high school where she was
valedictorian during World War II, Plains Baptist Church where she and
the former president were once outliers arguing for racial integration,
the commercial district where she became Jimmy’s indispensable partner
in their peanut business, the old train depot where she helped run the
winning 1976 presidential campaign, and Plains Methodist Church, where
as an 18-year-old in 1946, she married young Navy Lt. Jimmy Carter.</p>
<p>The route ends in what locals call “the Carter compound,” property
that includes their one-story ranch house, the pond where she fished,
and security outposts for the Secret Service agents who protected her
for 47 years.</p>
<p>She will be buried in view of the front porch of the home where the
39th American president still lives.</p>

Alleges Indian Government Officer Directed Assassination Plot</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A man who claimed to be a “senior field officer” for an Indian
intelligence agency has been accused by U.S. federal prosecutors of
orchestrating a foiled assassination plot against an American citizen
who is the leader of Sikh separatist movement.</p>
<p>Documents made public by the U.S. Department of Justice on Wednesday
do not name the Indian official, but indicated he worked with others in
a government office in New Delhi and hired Nikhil Gupta, an Indian
national, to arrange the killing.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors allege the Indian official was repeatedly in
contact with Gupta and wired him $15,000 as an advance payment for a
promised $100,000 for the murder of the political activist.</p>
<p>Gupta, who is 52, is awaiting extradition to the United States from
the Czech Republic. He faces murder-for-hire, conspiracy and
racketeering charges in the United States in connection with the alleged
plot.</p>
<p>The leader of Sikhs for Justice, attorney Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a
U.S.-Canadian dual national, has previously indicated he was the target,
telling reporters the government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi
wanted to kill him for criticizing the Indian government and advocating
for an independent state of Khalistan.</p>
<p>“The defendant conspired from India to assassinate, right here in New
York City, a U.S. citizen of Indian origin who has publicly advocated
for the establishment of a sovereign state for Sikhs,” said U.S.
Attorney Damian William in a statement. “We will not tolerate efforts to
assassinate U.S. citizens on U.S. soil.”</p>
<p>Defendant’s ‘hitman’ was undercover agent</p>
<p>U.S. law enforcement detected and disrupted the operation.</p>
<p>According to a superseding indictment unsealed Wednesday, Gupta
contacted an individual whom Gupta believed to be a criminal associate,
but who was actually a confidential source working with the Drug
Enforcement Agency.</p>
<p>Gupta asked the source for assistance in contracting a hitman to
murder the target in New York City. The confidential source introduced
Gupta to a purported hitman, who was in fact an undercover U.S. law
enforcement officer, according to the indictment.</p>
<p>“When a foreign government employee allegedly committed the brazen
act of recruiting an international narcotics trafficker to murder a U.S.
citizen on U.S. soil, DEA was there to stop the plot,” said DEA
Administrator Anne Milgram in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A day after a Sikh separatist in Canada, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, was
assassinated on June 19 near Vancouver, Gupta allegedly instructed the
man he thought would be the hitman to proceed with the murder in New
York because both Sikh activists were on the same hit list.</p>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau subsequently accused the
Indian government of involvement in the killing of Nijjar. Trudeau’s
accusation, which India denied, roiled relations between Ottawa and New
Delhi.</p>
<p>Gupta was allegedly instructed that if the New York killing could not
be done immediately, he should tell the assassin to wait until after
Modi concluded his June 22 state visit to U.S. President Joe Biden at
the White House.</p>
<p>The Biden administration learned of the alleged plot late the
following month and raised the matter with senior Indian government
officials, according to The Washington Post. In early August, national
security adviser Jake Sullivan brought his concerns to his counterpart,
Ajit Doval, in person during a meeting in another country in the region,
the newspaper reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The same message was subsequently amplified by the director of the
Central Intelligence Agency, William Burns, when he flew to New Delhi to
meet Ravi Sinha, who heads the Research and Analytical Wing, India’s
external intelligence agency.</p>
<p>Biden, according to media reports, also raised the matter when he met
again with Modi at the Group of 20 Summit in September in New Delhi.</p>
<p>“Indian counterparts expressed surprise and concern” when confronted
by the allegations, National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne
Watson said last week, after the New York plot was first reported by the
Financial Times. “They stated that activity of this nature was not their
policy.”</p>
<p>India’s government has set up a high-level inquiry to look into the
allegations of its involvement.</p>
<p>The U.S. government shared some information and India “takes such
inputs seriously since they impinge on our national security interests
as well, and relevant departments were already examining the issue,”
said External Affairs Ministry spokesman Arindam Bagchi in a statement
issued Wednesday.</p>
<p>Lynn Davis contributed to this report.</p>

id="biden-takes-bidenomics-to-colorado-hits-maga-republicans-1">Biden
Takes ‘Bidenomics’ to Colorado, Hits ‘MAGA’ Republicans</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Gearing up for his 2024 reelection bid, U.S. President Joe Biden on
Wednesday touted his “Bidenomics” agenda, contrasting his vision to
build the economy “from the bottom up and the middle out” with that of
so-called MAGA Republicans who support former President Donald Trump’s
Make America Great Again agenda.</p>
<p>Biden defended his administration’s signature pieces of legislation
against their attacks, including his 2022 climate and energy law known
as the Inflation Reduction Act and his 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law, as well as the Obama-era Affordable Care Act that expanded access
to health insurance.</p>
<p>“The speaker [of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson], Donald
Trump and the MAGA Republicans in Congress are committed to protecting
outrageous tax cuts for those at the very top,” said Biden, in remarks
at CS Wind, the world’s largest wind tower manufacturer, in Pueblo,
Colorado. “And they’re going to continue to oppose investing in all
those programs that help people whether in education, health care, or
whateverl”.</p>
<p>CS Wind is expanding with a new $200 million facility that it
directly attributes to the Inflation Reduction Act. The company said the
expansion is set to be completed in 2028 and will create 850 jobs.</p>
<p>“When I hear climate, I think jobs,” Biden said. “Instead of
exporting jobs, companies, both foreign and domestic are creating jobs
here in America and exporting American made products.”</p>
<p>Pueblo is in a congressional district represented by Lauren Boebert,
a Trump supporter and harsh critic of Biden’s economic policies. She
voted against passing the IRA, calling it “dangerous for America.”</p>
<p>“I am very proud of the work that CS Winds is doing there in Pueblo
and the jobs that they’re creating,” Boebert said during an interview
Tuesday with local TV station KKTV. “But as I stated, this will cost the
taxpayers overall from the Inflation Reduction Act hundreds of billions
of dollars. This bill was a complete scam.”</p>
<p>In his remarks, Biden took jabs against the congresswoman, dismissing
her criticism that the IRA is a “massive failure” as her “massive
failure in thinking.” Boebert and her Republican colleagues voted
against “the law that made these investments in jobs possible,” he
said.</p>
<p>Since Biden took office, companies have announced $7 billion in new
manufacturing and clean energy investments in Colorado, the White House
said in a statement.</p>
<p>Economy a top concern</p>
<p>With many voters saying the economy is a top concern in the 2024
election, the White House has been ramping up messaging to contrast the
president’s vision against what he calls Republican’s “trickle-down
economics” — the theory that tax breaks and benefits for corporations
and the wealthy will eventually benefit everyone.</p>
<p>They insist that Biden’s policies have steered the country away from
recession, highlighting positive economic growth, a declining rate of
inflation, and continued low unemployment.</p>
<p>Many economists agree Biden’s policies have been successful at the
macro level. Yet there is a disconnect with how Americans feel within
their households. Only 32% of Americans polled approve of Biden’s
handling of the economy, according to a Gallup poll released Tuesday.
His overall approval rating stood at 37%.</p>
<p>Republicans eager to capitalize</p>
<p>“For millions of families, ‘Bidenomics’ is just code for higher
prices, shrinking paychecks, and lower quality of life,” Senate Minority
Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement Wednesday. “The White House
seems to be counting on middle class families to forget about the
40-year-high inflation their spending binge helped create. They want the
country to set aside that average food prices have risen 20% since
President Biden took office.”</p>
<p>After a two-year period of the highest inflation in decades, U.S.
inflation is slowing and is lower than in comparable economies in
Europe. However, Americans still feel the pain from prices that are
still higher than they were four years ago. They’re also finding it
difficult to find affordable credit, as the Federal Reserve imposes
higher interest rates to fight inflation.</p>
<p>“The American public are just feeling a little grumpy still,” said
William Hoagland a senior vice president who focuses on economic policy
analyses at the Bipartisan Policy Center. “They haven’t fully recovered
from what was really a dire situation during COVID — high inflation, job
insecurity.”</p>
<p>Republican presidential candidates have for the most part campaigned
on reducing taxes, spending and regulations. Biden has accused them of
planning to cut taxes for the wealthy and reduce benefits from popular
government programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.</p>

<h2 id="blinken-no-fatigue-in-nato-support-of-ukraine">Blinken: ‘No
Fatigue’ in NATO Support of Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday there is
“strong bipartisan support” for Ukraine in the United States and sees
“no sense of fatigue” among NATO allies continuing their support as the
country enters its second winter of war against Russia.</p>
<p>“Some are questioning whether the United States and other NATO allies
should continue to stand with Ukraine as we enter the second winter of
Putin’s brutality. But the answer here today at NATO is clear, and it is
unwavering. We must and we will continue to support Ukraine,” Blinken
said during a press conference in Brussels on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Since the war began, the United States has provided about $77 billion
in assistance to Ukraine, which includes humanitarian, financial and
military aid, according to Blinken. He noted that Washington’s European
allies have provided more than $110 billion in support of Kyiv.</p>
<p>‘Ultimate membership’</p>
<p>Ukraine’s path to NATO membership was discussed during Wednesday’s
first foreign minister-level meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council.
Blinken also held separate talks with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro
Kuleba.</p>
<p>The top U.S. diplomat said the allies reaffirmed their policy that
“Ukraine will become a member of NATO when all allies agree and when
conditions are met.”</p>
<p>In a separate press conference, NATO Secretary-General Jens
Stoltenberg said the member state laid out recommendations to Ukraine’s
reforms.</p>
<p>“Ukraine is closer to NATO than ever before. We will continue to
support them on the path to membership and will continue to support
Ukraine’s fight for freedom,” Stoltenberg told reporters at NATO
headquarters.</p>
<p>The United States is hosting the next NATO summit in Washington from
July 9 to 11, 2024. Blinken discussed priorities for the meeting with
his counterparts as the alliance celebrates its 75th anniversary next
year.</p>
<p>A senior U.S. official told reporters that a significant portion of
the discussions leading up to the Washington summit would aim to ensure
that Ukraine is making the necessary progress toward “ultimate
membership” in NATO “when conditions are right.”</p>
<p>The bloc’s member states have suggested to Ukraine “a set of
governance reforms,” including strengthening anti-corruption agencies
and authorities.</p>
<p>The NATO-Ukraine Council was inaugurated at the NATO Summit in
Vilnius on July 12, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and
other heads of member governments also in attendance.</p>
<p>It convened for the second time in late July to discuss Black Sea
security following Russia’s withdrawal from a deal overseeing grain
exports from Ukrainian ports.</p>
<p>The third meeting was held in October to discuss substantial
assistance to Ukraine and to ensure Ukraine’s forces are fully
interoperable with NATO.</p>
<p>The NATO-Ukraine Council is the joint body where allies and Ukraine
sit as equal participants to advance political dialogue.</p>
<p>North Macedonia</p>
<p>Wednesday afternoon, Blinken leads the U.S. delegation to NATO member
North Macedonia, which is hosting a meeting of foreign ministers from
the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, or OSCE, in
its capital, Skopje.</p>
<p>Blinken said he is supporting OSCE’s “determination” to “advance
European security,” despite “Russia’s flagrant violations.”</p>
<p>Blinken is slated to hold talks with North Macedonia Foreign Minister
Bujar Osmani before heading to the Middle East later in the evening.</p>
<p>Bulgaria has given permission for Russian Foreign Minister Sergei
Lavrov’s plane to cross its airspace enroute to Skopje following North
Macedonia’s request, allowing him to attend the OSCE ministerial
meetings.</p>
<p>This has sparked an immediate outcry from Ukraine and the Baltic
nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, who will boycott the gathering
due to Lavrov’s expected attendance.</p>
<p>“We obviously respect every country’s ability to make its decision
about whether they should attend or not. We think it’s a useful forum to
engage with OSCE members and are going to attend for that reason,” a
senior State Department official told reporters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>When asked if Blinken would have any encounter with Lavrov during the
OSCE meetings, the official said, “We do not expect one.”</p>
<p>After Skopje, Blinken will make his third trip to the Middle East
since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7. The U.S. is seeking an
extension of the Israel-Hamas truce to allow more humanitarian aid into
Gaza and getting more hostages released.</p>

Wolverines Threatened With Extinction as Climate Change Melts
Refuges</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The North American wolverine will receive long-delayed federal
protections under a Biden administration proposal released Wednesday in
response to scientists warning that climate change will likely melt away
the rare species’ snowy mountain refuges.</p>
<p>Across most of the United States, wolverines were wiped out by the
early 1900s from unregulated trapping and poisoning campaigns. About 300
surviving animals in the contiguous U.S. live in fragmented, isolated
groups at high elevations.</p>
<p>In the coming decades, warming temperatures are expected to shrink
the mountain snowpack wolverines rely on to dig dens where they birth
and raise their young.</p>
<p>The decision Wednesday by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service follows
more than two decades of disputes over the risks of climate change and
threats to the long-term survival of the elusive species.</p>
<p>The animals resemble a small bear and are the world’s largest species
of terrestrial weasel. They are sometimes called “mountain devils” for
their ability to thrive in harsh alpine environments.</p>
<p>Protections were rejected under former President Donald Trump. A
federal judge in 2022 ordered the administration of President Joe Biden
to make a final decision this week on whether to seek protections.</p>
<p>In Montana, Republican lawmakers urged the Biden administration to
delay its decision, claiming the scientists’ estimates were inaccurate
to make a fair call about the dangers faced by wolverines. The
lawmakers, led by hard-right conservative Representative Matt Rosendale,
warned that protections could lead to future restrictions on activities
allowed in wolverine habitats, including snowmobiling and skiing.</p>
<p>In September, government scientists conceded some uncertainty about
how quickly mountain snowpacks could melt in areas with wolverines. But
they said habitat loss due to climate change — combined with other
problems such as increased development such as houses and roads — will
likely harm wolverine populations in decades to come.</p>
<p>“The best available information suggests that habitat loss as a
result of climate change and other stressors are likely to impact the
viability of wolverines in the contiguous U.S. through the remainder of
this century,” they concluded.</p>
<p>The scientists added that some of those losses could be offset if
wolverines are able to recolonize areas such as California’s Sierra
Nevada and Colorado’s Rocky Mountain.</p>
<p>Environmentalists argued in a 2020 lawsuit against the Fish and
Wildlife Service that wolverines face localized extinction from climate
change, habitat fragmentation and low genetic diversity.</p>
<p>Wolverine populations that are still breeding live in remote areas of
Montana, Wyoming, Idaho and Washington state. In recent years,
individual animals have been documented in California, Utah, Colorado
and Oregon.</p>
<p>The wildlife service received a petition to protect wolverines in
2000 and the agency recommended protections in 2010. The Obama
administration proposed protections and later sought to withdraw them
but was blocked by a federal judge who said in 2016 that the
snow-dependent animals were “squarely in the path of climate
change.”</p>
<p>Protections were rejected in 2020 under Trump, based on research
suggesting the animals’ prevalence was expanding, not contracting.
Federal wildlife officials at the time predicted that despite warming
temperatures, enough snow would persist at high elevations for
wolverines to den in mountain snowfields each spring.</p>
<p>They reversed course in a revised analysis published in September
that said wolverines were “less secure than we described.”</p>
<p>The animals need immense expanses of wildland to survive, with home
ranges for adult male wolverines covering as much as 1,580 square
kilometers (610 square miles), according to a study in central
Idaho.</p>
<p>They also need protection from trapping, according to scientists.
Wolverine populations in southwestern Canada plummeted by more than 40%
over the past two decades due to overharvesting by trappers, which could
have effects across the U.S. border, scientists said.</p>
<p>Wolverine trapping was once legal in states that include Montana.
They are still sometimes caught inadvertently by trappers targeting
other fur-bearing animals.</p>
<p>At least 10 wolverines have been accidentally captured in Montana
since trapping was restricted in 2012. Three were killed and the others
released unharmed. In Idaho, trappers have accidentally captured 11
wolverines since 1995, including three that were killed.</p>

sustainable aviation fuel</a> from a first-of-its-kind facility under
development in Texas called Project Roadrunner. Infinium, the company
behind the project, will be converting a former natural gas refinery
into a commercial “eFuels” plant where it will make jet fuel and diesel
from carbon dioxide and green hydrogen. The company announced the
offtake agreement on Wednesday along with a $75 million equity agreement
with Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, a subsidiary of a climate tech firm
backed by Bill Gates that focuses on first-of-a-kind projects. Infinium
specified that it would use “waste CO2” for the process, although it did
not say where the carbon would be sourced from.

<p>
Most so-called sustainable aviation fuels in use today are made from
waste cooking oils and agricultural residues, but experts are skeptical
they’re truly
<a href="https://theicct.org/publication/us-saf-production-capacity-nov23/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">scalable</a>.
In theory, fuel made from carbon dioxide captured from the atmosphere
and green hydrogen could be carbon neutral, though capturing the carbon,
and producing green hydrogen, requires a lot of energy.

heard ActivityPub described as

think it’s possible to create a federation system that takes a few days
to implement. Maybe it doesn’t need all the features they’ve put into
ActivityPub. I’m pretty sure a lightweight social network is what’s
called for now. I know 20 different ventures have started up to do this,
but isn’t it weird that none of them have built on RSS. That’s the only
approach imho that has a chance of doing something unique here. I’d
rather work with other people, but I’m not into replacing simplicity
with something that’s not very simple.</p>

When their bot says “there were only three possible solutions at that

know how many they are, if not what they are. The training has also

<h2 id="john-kerry-unveils-americas-plans-for-cop28">John Kerry Unveils
America’s​ Plans for COP28</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-29, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDU5MDQ4Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MTU2MzczNX0.EUKmf5emZF9hkrh0Q2Orul7XDh39SqSaIWIBdZDswS4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<div>
In a press conference on Wednesday morning, U.S. Climate Envoy John
Kerry previewed the three main issues the U.S. will be focused on
“securing strong outcomes” for at COP28, the United Nations climate
conference that kicks off tomorrow:<br/>
</div>
<p>
<strong>1. Acting on
<a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/s41558-023-01832-z/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
global stocktake</a>:</strong> Negotiators will discuss the results of
the first 5-year assessment of global climate progress and how countries
might make additional commitments. One of the main sticking points is
sure to be language around reducing fossil fuels. Kerry reiterated that
the U.S. supports requiring the “phase out of unabated fossil fuels,”
which leaves room for the continued use of oil, gas, and coal, as long
as the emissions are captured.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2. Standing up a new
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/loss-damage-fund-climate-cop28-disaster-extreme-weather-world-bank-f52dec84e0dc46054bde9391bbcd2f09" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fund
for loss and damage</a>: </strong>Countries agreed at last year’s COP to
set up a new fund to pay for the damages climate change is already
causing around the world, but have yet to figure out who will oversee
the fund, how much countries will pay into it, and how it will be
administered. Kerry said the U.S. supports a proposal that was released
earlier this month to house the fund at the World Bank for at least four
years, and make financial commitments completely voluntary — provisions
that the developing countries the fund is meant to support staunchly
oppose.
</p>
<p>
“I think that it’s important the fund does not represent any expression
of liability or compensation or any legal requirements, but it is going
to try to be there for those in the developing world who have taken some
of the brunt,” he said.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3. Making progress on the Paris Agreement’s
<a href="https://www.c2es.org/2023/11/the-importance-of-the-global-goal-on-adaptation-at-cop28/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">adaptation
goal</a>:</strong> While the Paris Agreement instructed signatories to
“enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce
vulnerability to climate change worldwide,” countries haven’t yet
decided how to turn that into a concrete goal.
</p>
<p>
Kerry also signaled that a new methane agreement would be announced that
involves oil and gas companies in addition to countries. He said there
“literally will be hundreds of initiatives” announced over the course of
the conference, including many from the U.S.
</p>
<p>
“What is very clear to us, and we will be pushing this the next two
weeks that we are negotiating, we have to move faster. There’s too much
business as usual still, we have got to bring people to the table who
are not yet there, and we will make progress in that here.”

<p>People who say Twitter is over aren’t considering how vast it is.
Same kind of situation as with Atom many years ago. It wasn’t obvious
how deeply installed RSS was, all the networks that had been created
with it. It was basically impossible at that time to displace RSS.
Anyway, same thing with Twitter today, no matter how vile
<a href="https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-tweets-pizzagate-conspiracy-pedo-epstein-1851053448">the
owner</a> of the network is. It has been around since 2006, a time of
huge growth in networking, and it captured basically all of it. So if
there’s anyone you need to reach, and they’re hooked up to the net, you
almost certainly will be able to reach them on Twitter. This is another
situation like Napster. Never have you had all the music of our
civilization available so easily to so many people. We could have done
so much with that. The most prudent thing to do with Twitter is to
organize a buyout for Musk, and get him out of that position. We don’t
need to delete it, not that we could, we need to get Musk out of a
position of control.</p>

Sponsored listings are a ripoff…for sellers (29 Nov 2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-29, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Sponsored listings are a ripoff…for sellers: Welcome to
the age of danegeld. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day
in history: 2008, 2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent publications,
upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading
Sponsored listings are a ripoff…for sellers (permalink) Not all ads are
created equally sleazy. The privacy harms from surveillance ads, though
real, are often hard to pin down. But there’s another kind of ad – or
“ad” that picks your pocket every time you use an ecommerce site. This
is the “sponsored listing” ad, which allows merchants to bid to be among
the top-ranked items in response to your searches – whether or not their
products are a good match for your query. These aren’t “ads” in the way
that, say, a Facebook ad is an ad. These are more #payola, a form of
bribery that’s actually a crime (but not when Amazon does it):
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payola#U.S._investigations_and_aftermath
Amazon is the global champion of payola. It boasts of $31 billion in
annual “ad” revenue. That’s $31 billion that Amazon sellers have to
recoup from you. But Amazon’s use of “most favored nation” deals (which
requires sellers to offer their lowest prices on Amazon) mean that you
don’t see those price-hikes because sellers raise their prices
everywhere:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/25/greedflation/#commissar-bezos Forget
Twitter: Amazon search is the poster-child for enshittification, in
which Amazon locks you in (for example, with a year’s shipping prepaid
through Prime) and then you get recommended worse products while sellers
make less money and Amazon pockets the difference. Sellers who don’t
sell on Amazon are dead in the water, because most US households have
Amazon Prime and overwhelmingly, Prime users start their search on
Amazon, and, if they find the goods they’re seeking. After all, they’ve
prepaid for shipping. So sellers suck it up and pay a 45-51% Amazon tax
and pass it on to us – no matter where we shop. A lot of the junk fees
sellers pay are related to Prime and other fulfillment services, but an
increasing share of the Amazon tax comes from the need to pay to
“advertise,” because if they don’t buy the top result for searches for
their own products, their competitors’ ads will push them right off the
first page (those competitors spend money on advertising, rather than
manufacturing quality). There’s a lot of YOLO/ROFLMAO in those ads:
search for “cat beds” and 50% of the first five screens are ads –
including ads for dog products, apparently bought by companies adopting
a spray-and-pray approach to advertising. Someone selling a quality
product still has to outbid all of those garbage sellers:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/28/enshittification/#relentless-payola
This is at the root of Amazon’s Pricing Paradox: while Amazon can defend
itself against regulators by citing sellers whose prices are lower
and/or whose quality is higher, it’s nearly impossible for shoppers to
get those deals. If you click the top result for your search, you will,
on average, pay 29% more than you would if you found the best bargain on
the site:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/06/attention-rents/#consumer-welfare-queens
What’s more, you can’t fix this by simply sorting by price, or by
reviews, or some mix of the two. The sleaziest sellers have mastered
tricks like changing the number of units they sell so the total price is
lower. For example, if batteries are normally sold $10 for a four-pack,
a sleazy seller can offer batteries at $9 for three units. A
lowest-to-highest price-sort will put this item ahead of a cheaper
rival. Researchers found that getting a good deal at Amazon requires
that you make a multifactorial spreadsheet by laboriously copy/pasting
multiple details from individual listing pages and then doing sorts that
Amazon itself doesn’t permit:
https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/3645/ There’s an
exception to this: Amazon and Apple have a cozy, secret arrangement to
exclude these “ads” from searches for Apple products. But if you’re
shopping for anything else, you’re SOL:
https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-gives-apple-special-treatment-while-others-suffer-junk-ads-2023-11
These payola markets are bad for buyers, and they cost sellers a lot of
money, but are they at least good for sellers? A new study from three
business-school researchers – Vibhanshu Abhishek, Jiaqi Shi and Mingyu
Joo – shows that payola is a very bad deal for good sellers, too:
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3896716 After doing
a lot of impressive quantitative work, the authors conclude that for
good sellers, showing up as a sponsored listing makes buyers trust their
products less than if they floated to the top of the results
“organically.” This means that buying an ad makes your product less
attractive than not buying an ad. The exception is sellers who have bad
products – products that wouldn’t rise to the top of the results on
their own merits. The study finds that if you buy your mediocre
product’s way to the top of the results, buyers trust it more than they
would if they found it buried deep on page eleventy-million, to which
its poor reviews, quality or price would normally banish it. But of
course, if you’re one of those good sellers, you can’t simply opt not to
buy an ad, even though seeing it with the little “AD” marker in the
thumbnail makes your product less attractive to shoppers. If you don’t
pay the danegeld, your product will be pushed down by the inferior
products whose sellers are only too happy to pay ransom. It’s a system
where everybody loses – except monopoly ecommerce platforms, who
enshittify everything and rake it in. Hey look at this (permalink) The

It’ll be one year this week since ChatGPT was released to the public.
While there was handwringing about waves of jobs being replaced by bots,
that hasn’t quite happened. We’ll take a look at how human workers are
using generative AI (or not). We’ll also hear why home prices in Detroit
have surged and how a Supreme Court case could upend how the Securities

<blockquote>
<p>
Security researchers Jesse D’Aguanno and Timo Teräs write that, with
varying degrees of reverse-engineering and using some external hardware,
they were able to fool the Goodix fingerprint sensor in a Dell Inspiron
15, the Synaptic sensor in a Lenovo ThinkPad T14, and the ELAN sensor in
one of Microsoft’s own Surface Pro Type Covers. These are just three
laptop models from the wide universe of PCs, but one of these three
companies usually does make the fingerprint sensor in every laptop we’ve
reviewed in the last few years. It’s likely that most Windows PCs with
fingerprint readers will be vulnerable to similar exploits…

id="us-military-osprey-aircraft-with-8-aboard-crashes-off-southern-japan-at-least-1-dead">US
Military Osprey Aircraft With 8 Aboard Crashes off Southern Japan, at
Least 1 Dead</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A crew member who was recovered from the ocean after a U.S. military
Osprey aircraft carrying eight people crashed Wednesday off southern
Japan has been pronounced dead, coast guard officials said.</p>
<p>The cause of the crash and the status of the seven others on board
were not immediately known, coast guard spokesperson Kazuo Ogawa
said.</p>
<p>The Osprey was carrying eight crew and is an Air Force aircraft, a
U.S. official who was not authorized to speak to the media said on
condition of anonymity. While the Marine Corps flies most of the Osprey
aircraft that are based in Japan, the Air Force also has Ospreys
deployed there.</p>
<p>Earlier reports had said the aircraft was carrying six or eight
people.</p>
<p>The official could not provide further information pending
notification of next of kin.</p>
<p>The Osprey is a hybrid aircraft that takes off and lands like a
helicopter, but during flight can rotate its propellers forward and
cruise much faster like an airplane.</p>
<p>Ospreys have had a number of accidents in the past, including in
Japan, where they are deployed at both U.S. and Japanese military bases.
In Okinawa, where about half of the 50,000 American troops in Japan are
based, Gov. Denny Tamaki told reporters Wednesday that he will ask the
U.S. military to suspend all Osprey flights in Japan.</p>
<p>Coast guard spokesperson Ogawa said it received an emergency call
Wednesday afternoon from a fishing boat near the crash site off
Yakushima, an island south of Kagoshima on the southern main island of
Kyushu.</p>
<p>Coast guard aircraft and patrol boats found one person identified
only as a male who was later pronounced dead by a doctor at a nearby
port, he said. They also found gray-colored debris believed to be from
the aircraft and an empty inflatable life raft in an area about 1
kilometer (0.6 mile) off the eastern coast of Yakushima, Ogawa said.</p>
<p>The coast guard said it planned to continue searching through the
night.</p>
<p>Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said the Osprey disappeared
from radar a few minutes before the coast guard received the emergency
call. The aircraft requested an emergency landing at the Yakushima
airport about five minutes before it was lost from radar, NHK public
television and other media reported.</p>
<p>NHK quoted a Yakushima resident as saying he saw the aircraft turned
upside down, with fire coming from one of its engines, and then an
explosion before it fell to the sea.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said he planned to seek a further
explanation from the U.S. military, but declined to say whether he would
seek a temporary suspension of Osprey operations in Japan.</p>
<p>Ogawa said the aircraft had departed from the U.S. Marine Corps Air
Station Iwakuni in Yamaguchi prefecture and crashed on its way to Kadena
Air Base on Okinawa.</p>
<p>Japanese Vice Defense Minister Hiroyuki Miyazawa said it had
attempted an emergency sea landing and quoted the U.S. military as
saying its pilot “did everything possible until the last minute.”</p>
<p>U.S. and Japanese officials said the aircraft belonged to Yokota Air
Base in western Tokyo. U.S. Air Force officials at Yokota said they were
still confirming information and had no immediate comment.</p>
<p>Yokota Air Base is home to U.S. Forces Japan and the Fifth Air Force.
Six CV-22 Ospreys have been deployed at Yokota, including the one that
crashed.</p>
<p>In December 2016, a U.S. Marine Corps Osprey crashed off the Okinawa
coast, injuring two of the five crew members and triggering complaints
among local residents about the U.S. bases in Okinawa and the Osprey’s
safety record.</p>
<p>A U.S. Marine Corps Osprey with 23 Marines aboard crashed on a north
Australian island in August, killing at least three and critically
injuring at least five during a multinational training exercise.</p>
<p>It was the fifth fatal crash of a Marine Osprey since 2012, bringing
the total death toll at that time to at least 19.</p>

<p>Friends, Granted, we’re still 11 months before the election. Granted,
most people haven’t focused. Granted, polls are flawed. But seven
separate polls done over the last four weeks show Trump beating Biden.
None show Biden beating Trump. Hello? Trump — who’s under four separate
criminal indictments charging him with 91 crimes. Who’s been impeached
twice by the House. Who led an attempted coup against the United States.
Who continues to lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him. And who
is sounding more unhinged and fascist by the day — openly threatening to
use the Justice Department to prosecute his enemies, calling his
political opponents “vermin,” claiming that undocumented immigrants are
“poisoning the blood” of America.</p>

<h2 id="us-sends-first-of-three-military-planes-with-gaza-aid">US Sends
First of Three Military Planes With Gaza Aid</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The United States on Tuesday sent the first of three military planes
to Egypt with humanitarian aid for Gaza, promising to assist
Palestinians during a truce between Hamas and U.S. ally Israel. </p>
<p>The relief flights carrying food, medical supplies and winter gear
are the first by the U.S. military since the conflict began with the
October 7 attacks by Hamas on Israel. </p>
<p>The flights started a day after President Joe Biden said he would use
an extension of the truce to get more aid into Gaza, and as
international efforts continue to further prolong the pause. </p>
<p>“The humanitarian needs in Gaza demand that the international
community do much more. The United States is committed to this effort,”
Jake Sullivan, U.S. national security adviser, said in a statement.
 </p>
<p>Sullivan said Biden would work to “rally the international community
to urgently increase support” in a U.N. appeal for Gaza. </p>
<p>‘Supplies will save lives’</p>
<p>The first Air Force C-17 aircraft landed Tuesday in Egypt with 24.5
metric tons (54,000 pounds) of medical supplies and ready-to-eat food,
the U.S. Agency for International Development said. </p>
<p>The United Nations will take the aid from Egypt’s North Sinai region,
which borders the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, into the stricken Palestinian
territory itself, U.S. officials said. </p>
<p>“These U.N. supplies will save lives and alleviate the suffering of
thousands in Gaza,” Sullivan said. </p>
<p>Two further planeloads will arrive in the coming days, officials
said. </p>
<p>Mediator Qatar on Monday announced a 48-hour extension of an initial
four-day truce, opening the way for further releases of hostages seized
by Hamas during its attack on Israel. </p>
<p>‘Significant surge’ </p>
<p>Eight hundred aid trucks reached southern Gaza from Egypt in the
first four days of the truce, with some aid also reaching badly hit
northern Gaza, the U.S. officials said. </p>
<p>“The movement over the last four or five days of assistance has been
so significant in volume that a backfill … is now needed and these
planes are part of that backfill,” a senior U.S. official told reporters
on Monday. </p>
<p>While Washington has deployed two aircraft carriers in the region to
deter Iran and its allies, and ferried military assistance to key ally
Israel, it has not previously used military assets during this conflict
to deliver humanitarian aid. </p>
<p>Biden, who has firmly backed Israel while calling on it to reduce
civilian casualties, said on Monday that the truce had allowed a
“significant surge” in aid. </p>
<p>The White House said on Monday, however, that Israel had made it
clear it would continue its war on Hamas whenever the truce ended.  </p>
<p>U.S. officials said Biden had warned Israel that it must not cause
the same kind of mass displacements in southern Gaza that its offensive
in the north triggered earlier this month. </p>
<p>“From the president down we have reinforced this in a very clear way
for the government of Israel,” another U.S. official said. </p>
<p>Hamas staged the deadliest attack in Israel’s history when it broke
through Gaza’s militarized border on October 7. Israel says the attack
killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and that around 240 others were
taken hostage.    </p>
<p>In response, Israel launched a relentless bombing campaign and ground
offensive in Gaza, which the Hamas government says has killed 15,000
people, thousands of them children.</p>

id="as-israel-and-hamas-extend-truce-more-pressure-on-biden-to-push-for-permanent-cease-fire">As
Israel and Hamas Extend Truce, More Pressure on Biden to Push for
Permanent Cease-fire</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The decision by Israel and Hamas to extend their temporary truce in
Gaza from four days to six has raised expectations that both sides will
agree to further extensions to allow for more hostage swaps and
humanitarian aid to enter the Palestinian enclave.</p>
<p>Washington is stepping up efforts to extend the pause that allowed
the release of hostages held by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian
prisoners in Israeli detention. CIA Director Bill Burns was in Doha on
Tuesday meeting his Israeli, Egyptian and Qatari counterparts.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken will be back in the region later
this week with stops including Dubai, the West Bank and Israel.</p>
<p>The latest Israel-Hamas deal brought the number of Israelis freed to
60. An additional 21 hostages have been released in separate
negotiations.</p>
<p>“We want to get them all back,” John Kirby, National Security Council
coordinator for strategic communications, told reporters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>One hundred fifty Palestinians have been released from Israeli
prisons, but thousands remain.</p>
<p>While the administration considers the brief truce a diplomatic win,
it has also placed more pressure on U.S. President Joe Biden to persuade
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to make the stop
in fighting permanent.</p>
<p>The White House has so far resisted demands from human rights
activists and the progressive wing of Biden’s Democratic Party to end
U.S. support for Israel’s strikes and push for a permanent cease-fire.
Administration officials repeatedly say that at this point, humanitarian
relief can be achieved only through hostage deals that allow temporary
stops on Israeli attacks and more aid to flow in.</p>
<p>“Short-term pauses are entirely insufficient to meet the needs on the
ground and to address human rights conditions on the ground,” said Paul
O’Brien, executive director of Amnesty International USA.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, his group and others will be presenting nearly 1
million signatures calling on Biden to use his influence to bring about
a sustained cease-fire in Gaza.</p>
<p>“More and more Americans want this cease-fire,” he told VOA.
Fifty-three percent of American voters support calls for a cease-fire,
according to a recent Morning Consult poll.</p>
<p>Changing US calculus</p>
<p>The United States has staunchly supported Israel’s right to defend
itself since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks killed 1,200 people in Israel.
However, as the number of Palestinian deaths grows — topping 14,000,
according to the Gaza Health Ministry — the administration has been
increasingly vocal that Israel must minimize civilian harm. Last week,
Biden said he is considering making aid to Israel conditional based on
its conduct in the war.</p>
<p>Mounting Arab and international pressure, along with domestic anger,
is changing the administration’s calculus, said Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, a
Middle East political analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East
Policy. Biden is now “attempting to strike a moderate tone that
addresses competing priorities,” Alkhatib told VOA.</p>
<p>Domestic pressure comes not only from Arab Americans, American
Muslims and some Democrats but also from a Jewish group advocating for
American leadership to end the conflict diplomatically.</p>
<p>In a statement released Tuesday, the group J Street urged the Biden
administration to insist that Israel significantly change its military
operation, make clear that the U.S. “will not provide unbounded support
for a war with no limits and no exit strategy” and reject “any future
Israeli occupation, annexation or blockade in Gaza.”</p>
<p>It’s a delicate balance for Biden to navigate.</p>
<p>Pushing too hard on Netanyahu, who is already under immense domestic
pressure from the families of the more than 100 hostages still held by
Hamas, may backfire. Already anxious that a long pause will give Hamas
time to regroup and reposition its forces, the Israeli war Cabinet is
worried that prisoner swaps are boosting Hamas’ popularity in the
occupied West Bank.</p>
<p>And as administration officials often underscore, the U.S. is not the
one drawing up Israel’s war plans and battlefield decisions.</p>
<p>“We’re providing advice. We’re providing our perspectives,” Kirby
said.</p>
<p>Cease-fire challenges</p>
<p>Analysts say a permanent cease-fire would require one of two
developments: the dismantling of Hamas’ ability to rule Gaza and the
stripping of its military wing, the Qassam Brigades, of munitions and
infrastructure. Or, that Israel and Hamas forge a long-term agreement
that entails fundamental changes.</p>
<p>The prospects of the latter appear dim as Israel and Hamas have
fundamentally incompatible goals — each other’s destruction.</p>
<p>“It’s much more likely that Israel will destroy Hamas than vice
versa,” said Michael O’Hanlon, senior fellow of the foreign policy
program at the Brookings Institution. “But these are not two groups that
could work out a reasonable compromise on strategic long term and
states,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>While the Qassam Brigades can be weakened and Hamas’ governance
structures can be toppled, rooting out the group that has been in
control of Gaza since it won the 2006 election there is a different
matter.</p>
<p>“Whatever remains of Hamas politically after the Gaza war is over may
be incentivized to join the Palestinian Authority in pursuit of this
solution, something that Hamas’ Politburo has endorsed as a favorable
option,” Alkhatib said.</p>
<p>Biden and his aides have said that for a permanent cease-fire to
succeed, there must be a road map toward a two-state solution. Without
it, conditions will be ripe for a similar group to emerge, even if Hamas
had been dismantled.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, there will be more pressure on Israel to allow the
Palestinian Authority to govern in Gaza if Hamas is sufficiently
degraded, said Jonathan Rynhold, head of the Department of Political
Studies at Bar Ilan University.</p>
<p>Ideally for Israel and the U.S., it’s a reformed Palestinian
Authority that is “less corrupt, more free, better economically,” he
told VOA. It’s unclear whether those reforms can be achieved, and
whether Israel can provide the support for them under the current
right-wing coalition, he added.</p>

<h2 id="windows-nt-peeking-into-the-cradle">Windows NT: peeking into the
cradle</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>Reading the story of how Windows NT came to be was entertaining, as
it is a story of the system itself and the dynamics between Dave Cutler,
the original designer and lead for NT, and the other people involved in
the project. I was shy of being 10 years old when Windows NT launched
and I didn’t comprehend what was going on in the operating systems world
and why this release was such a big deal. Reading the book made me learn
various new things about the development process, the role of Microsoft
in that era, and allowed me to settle some questions I’ve had over the
years. This article is a mixture of a book review and a collection of
thoughts and reflections that the book evoked. Let’s begin because we
have a lot of ground to cover. Dave Cutler’s impact on the word of
computing really can’t be understated. I often wonder how he truly feels
about what his and his team’s creation turned into today – does he like
what Windows NT has become? Does he consider Windows 11 worthy of
carrying on the torch of NT? As Cutler still works at Microsoft, we
won’t get an answer any time soon, but I sure do hope he intends to
write down his memoirs in a tell-all book about his life and career,
because I’d be down for reading that.</p>

Chinese Loongsoon chip matches Intel’s 14600K in IPC tests</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>Chinese chip designer Loongson has finally launched its loong teased
“next-generation” 3A6000-series processors based on the LoongArch
microarchitecture. IPC tests showed the 3A6000 matching Intel’s Raptor
Lake i5-14600K in IPC (instructions per clock), with both chips clocked
at 2.5GHz. As well as the headlining x86 compatible processor came the
announcement of numerous partner desktop, laptop, and all-in-one
machines — plus a consumer-grade motherboard from Asus. It was also
entertaining to see a recorded overclocking session, which took an
LN2-cooled 3A6000 chip to the current maximum 3 GHz. Many of us are
being dismissive now, but give it a few more generations and Chinese PC
users won’t be depending on Intel or AMD anymore – and that’s pretty
impressive.</p>
