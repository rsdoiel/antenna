The impoverished imagination of neoliberal climate “solutions” (31 Oct
2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-31, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links The impoverished imagination of neoliberal climate
“solutions”: “All of the above” is a highly selective proposition. Hey
look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2003, 2008,
2013, 2018 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances,
current writing projects, current reading The impoverished imagination
of neoliberal climate “solutions” (permalink) There is only one planet
in the known universe capable of sustaining human life, and it is
rapidly becoming uninhabitable by humans. Clearly, this warrants bold
action – but which bold action should we take? After half a century of
denial and disinformation, the business lobby has seemingly found
climate religion and has joined the choir, but they have their own
unique hymn: this crisis is so dire, they say, that we don’t have the
luxury of choosing between different ways of addressing the emergency.
We have to do “all of the above” – every possible solution must be
tried. In his new book Dark PR, Grant Ennis explains that this “all of
the above” strategy doesn’t represent a change of heart by big business.
Rather, it’s part of the denial playbook that’s been used to sell
tobacco-cancer doubt and climate disinformation:
https://darajapress.com/publication/dark-pr-how-corporate-disinformation-harms-our-health-and-the-environment
The point of “all of the above” isn’t muscular, immediate action –
rather, it’s a delaying tactic that creates space for “solutions” that
won’t work, but will generate profits. Think of how the tobacco industry
used “all of the above” to sell “light” cigarettes, snuff, snus, and
vaping – and delay tobacco bans, sin taxes, and business-euthanizing
litigation. Today, the same playbook is used to sell EVs as an answer to
the destructive legacy of the personal automobile – to the exclusion of
mass transit, bikes, and 15-minute cities:
https://thewaroncars.org/2023/10/24/113-dark-pr-with-grant-ennis/ As the
tobacco and car examples show, “all of the above” is never really all of
the above. Pursuing “light” cigarettes to reduce cancer is incompatible
with simply banning tobacco; giving everyone a personal EV is
incompatible with remaking our cities for transit, cycling and walking.
When it comes to the climate emergency, “all of the above” means trying
“market-based” solutions to the exclusion of directly regulating
emissions, despite the poor performance of these “solutions.” The big
one here is carbon offsets, which allows companies to make money by
promising not to emit carbon that they would otherwise emit. The idea
here is that creating a new asset class will unleash the incredible
creativity of markets by harnessing the greed of elite sociopaths to the
project of decarbonization, rather than to the prudence of
democratically accountable lawmakers. Carbon offsets have not worked:
they have been plagued by absolutely foreseeable problems that have not
lessened, despite repeated attempts to mitigate them. For starters,
carbon offsets are a classic market for lemons. The cheapest way to make
a carbon offset is to promise not to emit carbon you were never going to
emit anyway, as when fake charities like the Nature Conservancy make
millions by promising not to log forests that can’t be logged because
they are wildlife preserves:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/03/18/greshams-carbon-law/#papal-indulgences
Then there’s the problem of monitoring carbon offsetting activity. Like,
what happens when the forest you promise not to log burns down? If
you’re a carbon trader, the answer is “nothing.” That burned-down forest
can still be sold as if it were sequestering carbon, rather than venting
it to the atmosphere in an out-of-control blaze:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/26/aggregate-demand/#murder-offsets When
you bought a plane ticket and ticked the “offset the carbon on my
flight” box and paid an extra $10, I bet you thought that you were
contributing to a market that incentivized a reduction in discretionary,
socially useless carbon-intensive activity. But without those carbon
offsets, SUVs would have all but disappeared from American roads. Carbon
offsets for Tesla cars generated billions in carbon offsets for Elon
Musk, and allowed SUVs to escape regulations that would otherwise have
seen them pulled from the market:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/24/no-puedo-pagar-no-pagara/#Rat What’s
more, Tesla figured out how to get double the offsets they were entitled
to by pretending that they had a working battery-swap technology. This
directly translated to even more SUVs on the road:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Tesla,_Inc.#Misuse_of_government_subsidies
Harnessing the profit motive to the planet’s survivability might sound
like a good idea, but it assumes that corporations can self-regulate
their way to a better climate future. They cannot. Think of how Canada’s
logging industry was allowed to clearcut old-growth forests and replace
them with “pines in lines” – evenly spaced, highly flammable,
commercially useful tree-farms that now turn into raging forest fires
every year:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/16/murder-offsets/#pulped-and-papered
The idea of “market-based” climate solutions is that certain harmful
conduct should be disincentivized through taxes, rather than banned.
This makes carbon offsets into a kind of modern Papal indulgence, which
let you continue to sin, for a price. As the outstanding short video
Murder Offsets so ably demonstrates, this is an inadequate, unserious
and immoral response to the urgency of the issue:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/14/for-sale-green-indulgences/#killer-analogy
Offsets and other market-based climate measures aren’t “all of the
above” – they exclude other measures that have better track-records and
lower costs, because those measures cut against the interests of the
business lobby. Writing for the Law and Political Economy Project, Yale
Law’s Douglas Kysar gives some pointed examples:
https://lpeproject.org/blog/climate-change-and-the-neoliberal-imagination/
For example: carbon offsets rely on a notion called “counterfactual
carbon,” this being the imaginary carbon that might be omitted by a
company if it wasn’t participating in offsets. The number of credits a
company gets is determined by the difference between its counterfactual
emissions and its actual emissions. But the “counterfactual” here comes
from a business-as-usual world, one where the only limit on carbon
emissions comes from corporate executives’ voluntary actions – and not
from regulation, direct action, or other limits on corporate conduct.
Kysar asks us to imagine a counterfactual that depends on “carbon
upsets,” rather than offsets – one where the limits on carbon come from
“lawsuits, referenda, protests, boycotts, civil disobedience”:
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2010/aug/29/carbon-upsets-offsets-cap-and-trade
If we’re really committed to “all of the above” as baseline for
calculating offsets, why not imagine a carbon world grounded in
foreseeable, evidence-based reality, like the situation in Louisiana,
where a planned petrochemical plant was canceled after a lawsuit over
its 13.6m tons of annual carbon emissions?
https://earthjustice.org/press/2022/louisiana-court-vacates-air-permits-for-formosas-massive-petrochemical-complex-in-cancer-alley
Rather than a tradeable market in carbon offsets, we could harness the
market to reward upsets. If your group wins a lawsuit that prevents
13.6m tons of carbon emissions every year, it will get 13.6 million
credits for every year that plant would have run. That would certainly
drive the commercial imaginations of many otherwise disinterested
parties to find carbon-reduction measures. If we’re going to revive
dubious medieval practices like indulgences, why not champerty, too?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champerty_and_maintenance That is, if
every path to a survivable planet must run through Goldman-Sachs, why
not turn their devious minds to figuring out ways to make billions in
tradeable credits by suing the pants off oil companies? There are any
number of measures that rise to the flimsy standards of evidence in
support of offsets. Like, we’re giving away $85/ton in free public money
for carbon capture technologies, despite the lack of any credible path
to these making a serious dent in the climate situation:
https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/energy-transition/072523-ira-turbocharged-carbon-capture-tax-credit-but-challenges-persist-experts
If we’re willing to fund untested longshots like carbon capture, why not
measures that have far better track-records? For example, there’s a
pretty solid correlation between the presence of women in legislatures
and on corporate boards and overall reductions in carbon. I’m the last
person to suggest that the problems of capitalism can be replaced by
replacing half of the old white men who run the world with women, PoCs
and queers – but if we’re willing to hand billions to ferkakte scheme
like carbon capture, why not subsidize companies that pack their boards
with women, or provide campaign subsidies to women running for office?
It’s quite a longshot (putting Liz Truss or Marjorie Taylor-Greene on
your board or in your legislature is no way to save the planet), but
it’s got a better evidentiary basis than carbon capture. There’s also
good evidence that correlates inequality with carbon emissions, though
the causal relationship is unclear. Maybe inequality lets the wealthy
control policy outcomes and tilt them towards permitting
high-emission/high-profit activities. Maybe inequality reduces the
social cohesion needed to make decarbonization work. Maybe inequality
makes it harder for green tech to find customers. Maybe inequality leads
to rich people chasing status-enhancing goods (think: private jet rides)
that are extremely carbon-intensive. Whatever the reason, there’s a
pretty good case that radical wealth redistribution would speed up
decarbonization – any “all of the above” strategy should certainly
consider this one. Kysar’s written a paper on this, entitled “Ways Not
to Think About Climate Change”:
https://political-theory.org/resources/Documents/Kysar.Ways%20Not%20to%20Think%20About%20Climate%20Change.pdf
It’s been accepted for the upcoming American Society for Political and
Legal Philosophy conference on climate change:
https://political-theory.org/13257256 It’s quite a bracing read! The
next time someone tells you we should hand Elon Musk billions to in
exchange for making it possible to legally manufacture vast fleets of
SUVs because we need to try “all of the above,” send them a copy of this
paper. Hey look at this (permalink) Mastodon’s latest update makes it

What caught my eye in Olga Kharif’s

Delistings From Exchanges Are Already Running at a Record Pace This
Year</i></a> was this:<br />
<blockquote>
Trading volume on most exchanges has plummeted in the past year, even as
the number of coins has continued to multiply, with more than 1.8
million tokens listed on centralized and decentralized exchanges.
</blockquote>
Kharif reported on the collapse of trading volume earlier in
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-11/coinbase-coin-trading-volume-is-likely-lowest-since-before-public-debut"><i>Coinbase’s
Quarterly Crypto Trading Volume Likely Lowest Since Before Public
Debut</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The largest US digital-asset platform registered about $76 billion in
spot trading volume, a drop of 52% from the year-ago period, according
to data compiled by researcher CCData. The tally is also likely the
least since before the company’s much ballyhooed direct listing on the
Nasdaq Stock Market in April 2021, or just months before prices of
cryptocurrencies peaked.

Thus what caught my eye wasn’t the drop in trading volume, it was
“<i>more than 1.8 million tokens</i>”! Below the fold I ask how this
could possibly make sense.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span> <br />

distribution</a>. Almost all the 1.8M tokens are completely irrelevant,
and are very likely to be scams.<br /> <br /> According to
coinmarketcap.com, the top 10 tokens have a combined “market cap” of
about $1.1T, with #10 TRON at $8.2B and a daily volume of $386M. They
represent about 88% of the total “market cap”. The next 10 have a
combined “market cap” of $52B, with #20 Avalanche at $3.7B and a daily
volume of $365M. The top 20 represent about 92% of the total.<br />
<br /> For contrast, tokens from 101 to 110 have a combined “market cap”
of $2.7B with #110 NEM at $254M and a daily volume of $7M. Past #100 we
are deep into shitcoin territory, but there is a long way yet to
go.<br /> <br /> The 1000<sup>th</sup> biggest token is currently
<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/?page=10">Vesper</a>. Its “market
cap” is $3.7M with a daily volume of $67K. This means that there are
more than 1.799M tokens with “market caps” less than $3.7M, or that at
least 99.9% of all tokens have “market caps” of less than $3.7M, and
derisory daily volume.<br /> <br /> Nearly 0.5% of the way to the 1.8M
mark we find things like #8767 XPRO, whose “market cap” is $5K. So it is
likely that 99.5% of all tokens have “market caps” of less than $5K.
Imagine how easily a token with a “market cap” of less than $5K could be
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/10/the-invisible-hand-of-market.html">manipulated!</a><br />
<br /> Another way to look at this is to compare “more than 1.8 million
tokens” with 4 million, the number of listed companies in the US. Do you
think that 99.5% of all listed companies in the US have “market caps” of
less than $5K?<br /> <br />

The top eight platforms account for nearly 92% of depth — a measure of
all bids and asks within 10% of the mid price — and 90% of volume,
according to Kaiko. Binance, the largest crypto exchange, has this year
accounted for more than 30% of global market depth and more than 60% of
worldwide trade volumes. Besides Binance, the list also includes
Coinbase, OKX and Huobi, among others. For context, there are hundreds
of crypto exchanges, according to data from CoinGecko, though many of
them see negligible or no trading at all.

<p>At first glance the graphs of volume on centralized and decentralized

volume is something like $15B/month, whereas centralized exchange volume

id="anti-war-protest-at-us-congress-hearing-as-biden-officials-ask-for-israel-ukraine-aid">Anti-War
Protest at US Congress Hearing As Biden Officials Ask for Israel,
Ukraine Aid</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Two of President Joe Biden’s top advisers asked U.S. lawmakers to
provide billions more dollars to Israel on Tuesday at a congressional
hearing interrupted repeatedly by protesters accusing American officials
of backing “genocide” against Palestinians in Gaza.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd
Austin testified to the Senate Appropriations Committee on Biden’s
request for $106 billion to fund ambitious plans for Ukraine, Israel and
U.S. border security.</p>
<p>Arguing that supporting U.S. partners is vital to national security,
Biden requested $61.4 billion for Ukraine, about half of which would be
spent in the United States to replenish weapons stocks drained by
previous support for Kyiv.</p>
<p>Biden also asked for $14.3 billion for Israel, $9 billion for
humanitarian relief — including for Israel and Gaza — $13.6 billion for
U.S. border security, $4 billion in military assistance and government
financing to counter China’s regional efforts in Asia.</p>
<p>As the hearing began, a line of protesters raised red-stained hands
in the air as an anti-war protest. Capitol police later removed them
from the hearing room after they shouted protests including, “Ceasefire
now!” and “Protect the children of Gaza!”</p>
<p>Blinken said U.S. support for Ukraine has made Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine “a strategic debacle” and stressed the importance of both
security assistance for Israel and humanitarian aid for Palestinians in
Gaza.</p>
<p>“Without swift and sustained humanitarian relief, the conflict is
much more likely to spread, suffering will grow, and Hamas and its
sponsors will benefit by fashioning themselves as the saviors of the
very desperation they created,” Blinken said.</p>
<p>Congress has already approved $113 billion for Ukraine since Russia
invaded in February 2022, but Biden’s $24 billion request for more funds
in August never moved ahead. The White House has said it has less than
$5.5 billion in funds to continue transferring weapons from U.S.
stockpiles to Ukrainian forces fighting Russia.</p>
<p>Republicans divided</p>
<p>The path forward for Biden’s latest funding plan looks uncertain.
Democrats solidly back Biden’s strategy of combining Ukraine aid with
support for Israel, as do many Republicans in both the Senate and House
of Representatives.</p>
<p>“We need to address all of these priorities as part of one package -
because the reality is these issues are all connected, and they are all
urgent,” Senate Appropriations Committee Chairperson Patty Murray
said.</p>
<p>Senator Susan Collins, the committee’s top Republican said she would
judge the funding request on whether it makes the United States more
secure.</p>
<p>But Republicans who lead the House of Representatives object to
combining the two issues, joined by a smaller number of party members in
the Senate. Opinion polls show public support for Ukraine aid declining
and many Republicans, particularly those most closely aligned with
former President Donald Trump, have come out against it.</p>
<p>With federal spending fueled by $31.4 trillion in debt, they question
whether Washington should be funding Ukraine’s war with Russia, rather
than backing Israel or boosting efforts to push back against a rising
China.</p>
<p>Newly elected House Speaker Mike Johnson has voted in the past
against assistance for Kyiv. On Monday, he introduced a bill to provide
$14.3 billion in aid to Israel by cutting funding for the Internal
Revenue Service, setting up a showdown with Senate Democrats.</p>
<p>Johnson became speaker after a three-week stalemate in the House
after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted partly because he worked
with Democrats to pass a government funding bill.</p>
<p>Biden’s support for Israel, which already receives $3.8 billion in
annual U.S. military assistance, has drawn criticism amid international
appeals for Gaza civilians to be protected.</p>
<p>Palestinian authorities say that Israel’s “total siege” of Gaza since
that rampage has killed more than 8,300 people, more than 3,400 of them
minors, and left a dire need for fuel, food and clean water.</p>
<p>Israel this week launched a ground offensive in the Gaza Strip as it
strikes back at Islamist Hamas militants who killed 1,400 people and
took at least 240 hostages in a rampage on Oct. 7.</p>

<h2 id="trying-to-use-sway-as-my-window-manager">Trying to use Sway as

<p>date: 2023-10-31, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Trying to use Sway as my window manager
</h1>
<p>
I’m hoping to get a MNT Pocket Reform at some point and I heard that it
comes with Sway as the default window manager. No problem, I can get
into that. Years ago I was a fan of ratpoison and i3. Today, I’m trying
to use sway. I think my biggest problem right now is that the
pipe/backslash key works like a &lt; and &gt; key. How weird is that.
Maybe some weird key binding that is coming back to haunt me.
</p>
<p>
In order to get started, I copied <code>/etc/sway/config</code> to
<code>~/.config/sway/config</code> and started making some changes.
</p>
<p>
Scrolling with the touch pad was weird. Somehow inverted! The answer was
to have <code>natural_scroll enabled</code> for the touchpad input.
</p>
<pre><code>input &#34;2:14:ETPS/2_Elantech_Touchpad&#34; {
    dwt enabled
    tap enabled
    natural_scroll enabled
    middle_emulation enabled
}
</code></pre>
<p>
Caps Lock is no longer the Compose Key and that makes me sad. The answer
was to specify <code>xkb_options compose:caps</code> for the keyboard
input.
</p>
<pre><code>input &#34;1:1:AT_Translated_Set_2_keyboard&#34; {
    xkb_layout us
    xkb_variant altgr-intl
    xkb_options compose:caps
}
</code></pre>
<p>
Getting the less key instead of the backslash key remained a problem.
There are so many variants in
<code>/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us</code>. After a while I realised
that I needed a variant with LSGT (less/greater) being mapped to
<code>backslash</code> and <code>bar</code>, like this:
</p>
<pre><code>key &lt;LSGT&gt; {   [ backslash,         bar    ]   };
</code></pre>
<p>
The options I had seemed to be: <code>euro</code>, <code>ibm2381</code>,
<code>intl</code>, and so on. But also anything that contained dead keys
was no good:
</p>
<pre><code>    key &lt;TLDE&gt; { [dead_grave, dead_tilde,         grave,       asciitilde ] };
</code></pre>
<p>
In these variants, I have to type every back-quote, single-quote,
double-quote and circumflex twice.
<a class="account" href="https://social.sdfeu.org/@bkhl" title="@bkhl@social.sdfeu.org" rel="nofollow"><span
class="citation" data-cites="bkhl">@bkhl</span></a> pointed me to
<code>altgr-intl</code>. Thanks!
</p>
<p>
Now I’m wondering about suspending the laptop. With Gnome, I’d hit the
GUI key and type “suspend”, Enter, done. But there is no “suspend”
command. I ended up installing <code>wlogout</code> which gives me huge
buttons to lock, logout, suspend, hibernate, shutdown and reboot. But,
surprisingly, when it suspends, and it comes back, no password is
required. That’s weird!
</p>
<p>
I installed <code>cryptsetup-suspend</code> which adds something the old
setup did not have: returning from a suspend now asks for the disk
decryption password but still does not ask for the account password.
Well, on a single user system like mine, one of the two is good enough,
I guess. But still.

Time has passed and today I added keybindings for lowering and raising
the volume.
</p>
<pre><code>bindsym XF86AudioLowerVolume exec amixer set Master &#39;10%-&#39;
bindsym XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec amixer set Master &#39;10%+&#39;
</code></pre>
<p>
So proud of myself. 😁
</p>
<p>
As for playback from the command-line, right now I’m using
<code>mpv</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>mpv &#34;https://somafm.com/secretagent.pls&#34;
</code></pre>
<h2>
Status bar
</h2>
<p>
OK, time for fiddling with stuff. Every minute, the script called to
produce the status bar.
</p>
<pre><code>bar {
    position top
    status_command while ~/.config/sway/status.fish; do sleep 60; done
    colors {
        statusline #ffffff
        background #323232
        inactive_workspace #32323200 #32323200 #5c5c5c
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
The script prints something like this:
</p>
<pre><code>Bandu 65% 🟡 100% 🔊 fully-charged🔋 2023-10-31 15:40
</code></pre>
<p>
This is the code. As you can see it calls <code>awk</code>,
<code>perl</code> and tons of other stuff. Yikes!
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
# The Sway configuration file in ~/.config/sway/config calls this script.

More colleges are offering early decision admissions, where students
signal that a particular university is their top choice but have to
commit before seeing their financial aid package. Early decision is not
without controversy. Students who apply early tend to be wealthier, and
critics say the practice undermines fairness. Plus, child care costs
continue to climb, and the UAW hopes its contract wins will encourage
other car manufacturers to unionize.

Mayfield</a>: “The reason Threads doesn’t have an API or the promised
Fediverse coupling is organizational inertia for the fear of another
Cambridge Analytica.” I think that’s very likely true. I was using
Facebook’s API when they quietly turned it off, and I didn’t blame them
for it, given the way journalism was treating them. Everyone knew they
had an API, and what it could do was openly published, and promoted by
the same journalists who were now blaming them. So while FB has few
scruples to admire them for, as a company – in this case I believe
Ross’s explanation of why they are treading very carefully here.</p>

id="uaw-strike-won-things-no-one-thought-possible-from-automakers">UAW:
Strike ‘Won Things No One Thought Possible’ from Automakers</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The United Auto Workers won at least partial victories on many of the
key demands that led to the six-week strike against Ford, General Motors
and Jeep maker Stellantis.</p>
<p>The union has given some details of the deals, including a detailed
explanation of the agreement it reached with Ford. The agreement is
expected to become the model for later settlements with GM and
Stellantis. Rank-and-file UAW members must ratify each contract before
it takes effect.</p>
<p>“We won things no one thought possible,” UAW President Shawn Fain
said when he announced the tentative agreement last week.</p>
<p>The union represents 57,000 workers at the company, and about 16,600
of them were on strike. Here are the key terms of the agreements, as
detailed by the union:</p>
<p>Pay</p>
<p>The tentative agreements call for 25% increases in pay by April 2028,
raising top pay to about $42 an hour, according to the union. That
starts with an 11% boost upon ratification, three annual raises of 3%
each, and a final increase of 5%. The UAW said restoration of
cost-of-living increases, which were suspended in 2009, could boost the
total increases to more than 30%.</p>
<p>The union initially asked for 40% increases, but scaled that back to
36% before the strike started Sept. 15. Ford’s last offer before the
strike was 9% more pay over four years. More recently, Ford, GM and
Stellantis were all offering 23% total pay increases.</p>
<p>For historical comparison, the union said its workers saw pay
increases of 23% for all the years from 2001 through 2022. </p>
<p>Bonuses</p>
<p>The deals include $5,000 ratification bonuses. </p>
<p>Temporary workers</p>
<p>The union said Ford’s temporary workers will get pay raises totaling
150% over the life of the deal, and workers at certain facilities will
also get outsized raises. The temporary workers will also get the
ratification bonuses and will get profit-sharing starting next year,
officials said.</p>
<p>Benefits</p>
<p>The companies did not agree to bring back traditional defined-benefit
pension plans or retiree health care for workers hired since 2007. But
they agreed to increase 401(k) contributions to about 9.5%.</p>
<p>Shorter work week</p>
<p>The UAW asked for a shorter work week — 40 hours of pay for 32 hours
of work. It did not get that concession.</p>
<p>Worker tiers</p>
<p>The union said Ford and GM agreed to end most divisive wage tiers, a
system under which new hires were put on a less attractive pay scale.
Fain and union members had highlighted the issue, saying it was unfair
for people doing the same work to be paid less than co-workers.</p>
<p>Climbing the ladder</p>
<p>The agreement shortens the time it will take workers to reach top
scale, to three years. It took eight years under the contract that
expired in September. </p>
<p>Right to strike</p>
<p>The union said it won the right to strike against any of the three
companies over plant closures. The automakers had rejected the proposal
at the start of talks.</p>
<p>Union organizing</p>
<p>The agreements with Ford, GM and Stellantis could give the UAW a
boost as it seeks to represent workers at nonunion plants in the U.S.
that are operated by foreign carmakers and Tesla, as well as future
plants that will make batteries for electric vehicles.</p>
<p>The union said Ford agreed to put workers at a future battery plant
in Michigan under the UAW’s master contract, and GM agreed to do so with
work at Ultium Cells, a joint venture between the company and LG Energy
Solution of South Korea.</p>
<p>Fain vowed Sunday that the union will “organize like we’ve never
organized before” at nonunion plants.</p>
<p>“When we return to the bargaining table in 2028, it won’t just be
with the Big Three but with the Big Five or the Big Six,” he said in an
online message to union members.</p>

California Wildfire Prompts Evacuation Order for Thousands as Santa Ana
Winds Fuel Flames</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A wildfire fueled by gusty Santa Ana winds ripped through rural land
southeast of Los Angeles on Monday, forcing about 4,000 people from
their homes, fire authorities said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The so-called Highland Fire erupted at about 12:45 p.m. in dry,
brushy hills near the unincorporated Riverside County hamlet of
Aguanga.</p>
<p>As of late Monday night, it had spread over about 2 square miles (5
square kilometers) of land, fire spokesman Jeff LaRusso said.</p>
<p>About 1,300 homes and 4,000 residents were under evacuation orders,
he said.</p>
<p>The fire had destroyed three buildings and damaged six others but it
wasn’t clear whether any were homes. The region is sparsely populated
but there are horse ranches and a large mobile home site, LaRusso
said.</p>
<p>No injuries were reported.</p>
<p>Winds of 20 to 25 miles per hour (32 to 40 kph) with some higher
gusts drove the flames and embers through grass and brush that were
dried out by recent winds and low humidity so that it was “almost like
kindling” for the blaze, LaRusso said.</p>
<p>The winds were expected to ease somewhat overnight and fire crews
would attempt to box in the blaze, LaRusso said.</p>
<p>But, he added: “Wind trumps everything. Hopefully the forecast
holds.”</p>
<p>A large air tanker, bulldozers and other resources were called in to
fight the fire, one of the few large and active blazes to have erupted
so far in California’s year-round fire season, LaRusso said.</p>
<p>Southern California was seeing its first significant Santa Ana wind
condition. The strong, hot, dry, dust-bearing winds typically descend to
the Pacific Coast from inland desert regions during the fall. They have
fueled some of the largest and most damaging fires in recent California
history.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service said Riverside County could see winds of
15 to 25 mph (24 to 40 kph) through Tuesday with gusts as high as 40
miles per hour (64 kph). The weather service issued a red flag warning
of extreme fire danger through Tuesday afternoon for parts of Los
Angeles and Riverside counties.</p>

<h2 id="bought-some-tea-for-2024">Bought some tea for 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-31, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Bought some tea for 2024
</h1>
<p>
We went to visit Bern, walked through the botanical gardens, saw the
bears, drank hot chocolate and finally went to see friends for dinner.
</p>
<p>
But before going there, we had set aside an hour to buy tea at
<a href="https://www.laenggasstee.ch/index.php" rel="nofollow">Länggass
Tee</a>. We drank three different kinds of pu-ehr tea and I ended up
buying a cake.
</p>
<p>
It is only now as we’re sitting in the train home that I see on their
homepage that they got some Dongpian Oolong from Taiwan: A Li Shan Dong
Pian 阿里山冬片 and Gu Keng Dong Pian 古坑冬. Should have bought some!
Oh, and they bought some Korean tea, too! Ha Dong Dae Jak 河东大雀
하동대작, Ha Dong Se Jak 河东细雀 하동세작 and Jirisan Wu Jeon
智异山雨前 지리산우전.
</p>
<p>
Next time I really should read the website <em>before</em> we go visit,
not on the way home.
</p>
<p>
Here’s what I bought:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Sencha Uji Special (100g)
</li>
<li>
Gang Kou Cha Meer Oolong (100g) 港口茶
</li>
<li>
Bai Hao Wu Long, Oriental Beauty (50g) 东方美人 白毫鸟龙
</li>
<li>
Ye Lai Xiang, Phoenix Single Bush (50g) 凤凰单丛 夜来香
</li>
<li>
Pu Er Sheng Bing Gu Shu Cha, Manzhuang 2013 (375g) 普洱生饼古树茶 曼庄
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I still have three bags of tea open, but I also don’t come often to Bern
too often, so this is what I’ll be drinking in the coming year. 🍵
</p>
<p>
I also had to explain to my wife how little I knew and that I knew true
tea nerds on fedi like
<a class="account" href="https://social.tchncs.de/@babelcarp" title="@babelcarp@social.tchncs.de" rel="nofollow"><span

id="uaw-reaches-deal-with-gm-ending-strike-against-detroit-automakers">UAW
Reaches Deal With GM, Ending Strike Against Detroit Automakers</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>General Motors and the United Auto Workers (UAW) struck a tentative
deal on Monday, ending the union’s unprecedented six-week campaign of
coordinated strikes that won record pay increases for workers at the
Detroit Three automakers.</p>
<p>The accord follows deals the union reached in recent days with Ford
and Chrysler-owner Stellantis— significant victories for auto workers
after years of stagnant wages and painful concessions following the 2008
financial crisis.</p>
<p>“We wholeheartedly believe our strike squeezed every last dime out of
General Motors,” UAW President Shawn Fain said in a video address. “They
underestimated us. They underestimated you.”</p>
<p>The union officially suspended its strike against the Detroit Three.
UAW local leaders will come to Detroit on Friday to consider the deal
with GM, before taking terms to all union workers for ratification.</p>
<p>“We are looking forward to having everyone back to work across all of
our operations,” said GM CEO Mary Barra.</p>
<p>The new contracts will significantly raise costs for the automakers.
The companies and some analysts have said the deals will make it harder
for the Detroit Three to compete with electric-vehicle leader Tesla and
nonunion foreign brands such as Toyota Motor.</p>
<p>The UAW won from GM roughly the same package of wage increases agreed
with the other two automakers. Pay for veteran workers will rise by 33%
and GM will give $2,500 in five payments to retirees through 2028.</p>
<p>Sources have said pension benefits were a sticking point in the UAW’s
negotiations with GM, which has more retirees than Ford or
Stellantis.</p>
<p>Fain said the union’s move on Saturday to strike a key GM engine
factory in Spring Hill, Tennessee, “landed the knockout blow” that got
the deal.</p>
<p>The contract reverses years of efforts by GM to create lower-paid
groups of UAW workers at units such as component plants, parts
warehouses and electric vehicle battery operations. It puts workers at
GM’s battery joint-venture with South Korea’s LG Energy under the
national agreement.</p>
<p>Fain said some workers at GM’s component operations will get pay
increases of as much as 89%.</p>
<p>The contract also restricts use of lower paid temporary workers. “We
have slammed the door on having a permanent underclass of temporary
workers at GM,” Fain said.</p>
<p>The UAW also gained more sway over the companies’ investment
decisions by securing the right to strike over future plant
closures.</p>
<p>All three companies have said they do not plan to close existing
factories as they shift to EVs. Yet the contract could force them to
keep unprofitable plants open during a recession or period of slow sales
for new models.</p>
<p>Higher costs</p>
<p>A series of walkouts began on Sept. 15, and nearly 50,000 workers out
of nearly 150,000 UAW members at the Detroit automakers eventually
joined. The strategy of escalating strikes cost the Detroit Three and
suppliers billions of dollars.</p>
<p>UAW leaders called their contract fight part of a larger movement to
reverse decades of economic setbacks for working-class Americans. Some
analysts agreed.</p>
<p>“This is more than an auto industry story; it is a signal to the
entire country that unionized workers can demand and get big wage
increases,” said Patrick Anderson of the Anderson Economic Group.</p>
<p>The new contract will cost GM $7 billion over 4.5 years in higher
labor costs, two sources told Reuters. Ford said last week it would add
$850 to $900 per vehicle in labor costs.</p>
<p>“Consumers will bear some of the cost burden over time … automakers
will not have an easy time passing along all of the costs … and will
have to seek efficiencies in other ways, or further limit production to
more expensive vehicles that can absorb higher labor costs,” Cox
Automotive’s chief economist, Jonathan Smoke, said.</p>
<p>Praise from Biden</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden and politicians from both parties weighed in
to support the UAW as the union’s fight gained popularity with voters.
Michigan will again be a crucial swing state in the 2024 presidential
election, and Fain made support for the union’s fight a condition of
winning his endorsement. The UAW still has not formally endorsed Biden’s
re-election.</p>
<p>“This historic contract is a testament to the power of unions and
collective bargaining to build strong middle-class jobs while helping
our most iconic American companies thrive,” Biden said in a statement.
His aides had worried that a prolonged strike would damage the U.S.
economy and the Democratic president’s chances of re-election in
2024.</p>
<p>The UAW has said it is committed to organizing workforces at other
carmakers, making negotiations in 2028 between the union and the “Big
Five or Big Six.”</p>
<p>Momentum toward deals accelerated over the past two weeks after UAW
workers walked out at three of the most profitable factories in the
world. The UAW eventually struck against nine plants.</p>
<p>“We have shown the companies, the American public and the whole world
that the working class is not done fighting” Fain said. “In fact, we’re
just getting started.”</p>

House Welcomes Restoration of Telecommunications, Some Aid Into
Gaza</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The White House welcomed on Monday the limited flow of humanitarian
aid and the restoration of telecommunications in Gaza as Israel
continues its ground offensive on the enclave in response to the Hamas
militant group’s stunning Oct. 7 attack.</p>
<p>It also repeated its warning to regional actors to stay out of the
fight.</p>
<p>“Our message to any actor seeking to exploit this conflict is: don’t
do it,” said John Kirby, director of strategic communications for the
National Security Council. “And as you all know, we have strengthened
our force posture in the region. We’re continually watching to make sure
that any actor who might be tempted to jump in here knows that we will
take very seriously our national security interests in the region, not
to mention our obligation to protect our troops in our facilities that
are going after ISIS in places like Iraq and Syria.”</p>
<p>But this conflict is also exploding in the court of public opinion.
Hundreds of people stormed an airport in Russia’s Dagestan region over
the weekend, shouting antisemitic slurs over the arrival of a flight
from Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed the events on foreign
interference, saying they “were inspired, including through social
networks, not least from the territory of Ukraine by the agents of
Western intelligence services.”</p>
<p>Kirby dismissed that.</p>
<p>“It’s classic Russian rhetoric, when something goes bad in your
country: blame somebody else, blame it on outside influences. The West
had nothing to do with this. This is just hate, bigotry and
intimidation. Pure and simple,” he said.</p>
<p>“And a good leader, a decent leader will call it out for what it is
the way President [Joe] Biden has called it out here in this country,
instead of blaming the West for something and pushing it off to somebody
else,” Kirby said.</p>
<p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has dug in on his disagreement
with the U.S.’ classification of Hamas as a terror group and shifted
blame elsewhere.</p>
<p>“The West has the biggest responsibility for the massacre in Gaza,”
Erdogan said.</p>
<p>Iranian officials have piled on as well, with Iranian Foreign
Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian taking to the rostrum at the United
Nations last week to outline their view. Iranians have also protested on
the streets.</p>
<p>“It has been three weeks that we have been witness to the war crimes
and genocide of the occupying Israeli regime in Gaza and the West Bank
of Palestine,” Amirabdollahian said during an emergency United Nations
assembly earlier this month.</p>
<p>“The United States and several European countries have sided with the
occupying regime of Israel without observing the U.N. charter and
international law,” he said.</p>
<p>Kirby said the White House believes there is a fine line between
disagreement and discord, adding the administration is vigilant over
outbreaks of antisemitism.</p>
<p>“We believe in the right of peaceful protest, even if it’s, you know,
espousing ideas we don’t agree with,” he said. “But we don’t – nobody
wants – to see peaceful protests turn violent or turn dangerous the way
that this mob activity did in Dagestan yesterday. So it’s of concern and
it’s something that we’ll continue to talk about with our allies and
partners.”</p>
<p>The U.S. is also seeing such protests – many supportive of
Palestinians and critical of Israel – bubbling up at major U.S.
universities in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Spelman College, a historically Black institution in Georgia,
recently held a rally that drew hundreds of attendees in support of
Palestinians. Attendees carried signs with messages like “Free
Palestine” and “End all U.S. aid to Israel.”</p>
<p>Dr. Helene Gayle pointed to her institution’s main mission when VOA
asked how the school tries to frame debates like these.</p>
<p>“What I really hope and believe is that we are teaching young people
to be critical thinkers, teaching young people to go beyond sometimes
the simple messages that they’re hearing sometimes misinformation that
they may be getting – and really understand in a critical, analytic way
what the what the issues are so that they can take positions that are
well informed,” Gayle told VOA at the White House on Monday.</p>
<p>”You know, on Spelman’s campus, we are having opportunities to do
teach-ins and learn about the situation between Israel and Palestine and
thinking about how do we look at this in as balanced a way as we
possibly can,” she said. “So that’s what I really hope, is that we’re
continuing to teach a generation of young people who can be critical
thinkers who can look at information and think about it in balanced ways
so that they can be true spokespersons, but with a base of knowledge and
information that informs their opinions.”</p>

<p>We’ve already covered the end of life of Windows CE, but Ars has a
short but interesting look back at the history of this undeservedly
unloved operating system. It was a proto-netbook, it was a palmtop, it
was a PDA, it was Windows Phone 7 but not Windows Phone 8, and then it
was an embedded ghost. It parents never seemed to know what to do with
it after it grew up, beyond offer it up for anybody to shape in their
own image. And then, earlier this month, with little notice, Windows CE
was no more, at least as a supported operating system. I will never
forget Windows CE.</p>

<h2 id="swift-meet-winrt">Swift, meet WinRT</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>The goal of this post is to share how we, at the Browser Company,
have made it possible to use Swift to build a modern Windows
application. There is no UI framework for Windows written in Swift, and
Windows itself is written in C++ – so that may leave you wondering, “how
can I build my app on Windows”?  Modern Windows applications use WinRT,
a technology built on top of COM, which can interop really well with
Swift, as we presented in our previous post. To be able to build
idiomatic UI for Windows in Swift, we have built a language projection
tool which creates idiomatic Swift language bindings for WinRT, and
today we are open sourcing it at
https://github.com/thebrowsercompany/swift-winrt. Swift/Winrt is based
on Microsoft’s code generators for C++ (github.com/microsoft/cppwinrt)
and C# (github.com/microsoft/cswinrt), and thus is written in C++. Cool
stuff.</p>

<p>Since May, uBO has been in a cat-and-mouse game with YouTube. And
they’ve shown incredible resilience, especially when you consider that
there are only two people on the uBO team dealing with YouTube. The uBO
team members are all volunteers. They’ve gone above and beyond to meet
every little request from their users. But there’s a limit to how much
they can take. At some point, the constant demands become too much, and
they will leave uBO for good. It’s one thing to play cat and mouse with
YouTube. It’s quite another to deal with a wave of angry users. Maybe
that’s how YouTube will win this war of attrition. If you use YouTube
enough, YouTube Premium is a great deal – albeit it a deal that’s
steadily getting worse as Google increases its price.</p>

<h2 id="attacks-target-us-forces-in-iraq-syria">24 Attacks Target US
Forces in Iraq, Syria</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria have been attacked with drones or
rockets at least 24 times in recent days, including at least three
attacks on Monday, according to U.S. defense officials.</p>
<p>At least five of these attacks were launched after U.S. forces struck
two facilities in eastern Syria used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps and affiliated groups during the early morning hours of
Friday. None of the attacks carried out since the U.S. retaliatory
strikes on Friday have caused casualties or damage, according to defense
officials.</p>
<p>The latest attack on Monday used multiple rockets to target al-Asad
Air Base in western Iraq, a defense official told VOA on condition of
anonymity due to security sensitivities.</p>
<p>Other multi-rocket attacks were launched against forces at Green
Village and Mission Support Site Euphrates in Syria.</p>
<p>On Sunday, a one-way attack drone was used against U.S. forces at a
base near al-Shaddadi in northeastern Syria, and on Thursday another
one-way attack drone targeted U.S. and coalition forces at al-Asad Air
Base in Iraq, according to U.S. officials.</p>
<p>Pentagon Press Secretary Brigadier General Pat Ryder and other
officials have blamed Iranian-backed proxies for the near daily attacks
on U.S. forces.</p>
<p>“We know that these are Iranian-backed militia groups that are
supported by Iran and, of course, we hold Iran responsible for these
groups,” Ryder said last week.</p>
<p>‘Iran’s objective’</p>
<p>Asked by VOA on Monday whether the recent attacks are a sign that
U.S. deterrence is not working, a senior defense official replied,
“Iran’s objective for a long time has been to force a withdrawal of the
U.S. military from the region. What I would observe is that we’re still
there.”</p>
<p>One American F-15 and two American F-16 fighter jets used precision
munitions against a weapons storage facility and an ammunition facility
near Abu Kamal early Friday local time, according to defense officials.
The Pentagon assesses the strikes successfully hit their targets, and it
is still looking into casualty numbers.</p>
<p>“These precision self-defense strikes are a response to a series of
ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq
and Syria by Iranian-backed militia groups that began on October 17,”
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said in a statement on October 26.</p>
<p>“The United States will not tolerate such attacks and will defend
itself, its personnel, and its interests,” he added.</p>
<p>Officials have raised concerns about the prospect of “more
significant escalation” in the region from Iranian proxy groups.</p>
<p>“Spillover into Syria is not just a risk; it has already begun,” Geir
Pedersen, U.N. Special Envoy for Syria, told the U.N. Security Council
on Monday via videoconference.</p>
<p>The attacks since October 17 on U.S. and coalition forces have
resulted in 17 minor injuries to Americans in Syria and four minor
injuries to American personnel in Iraq, with U.S. officials continuing
to monitor any potential traumatic brain injuries.</p>
<p>One U.S. contractor at al-Asad Air Base in Iraq suffered a cardiac
episode while sheltering in place during a false alarm for an air attack
and later died.</p>
<p>At least 19 attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria occurred between
October 17 and October 26, according to the Pentagon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>US increasing protection in region</p>
<p>Approximately 900 troops have either deployed or are in process of
deploying from the United States to the Middle East to increase force
protection. These units include a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense,
or THAAD, battery from Fort Bliss, Patriot batteries from Fort Sill, and
Patriot and Avenger batteries from Fort Liberty.</p>
<p>These moves come after Austin had placed more than 2,000 military
personnel on heightened alert with a prepare-to-deploy order earlier
this month.</p>

Nations.</p>

<h2 id="biden-signs-sweeping-executive-order-on-ai-oversight">Biden
Signs Sweeping Executive Order on AI Oversight</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Joe Biden on Monday signed a wide-ranging executive order
on artificial intelligence, covering topics as varied as national
security, consumer privacy, civil rights and commercial competition. The
administration heralded the order as taking “vital steps forward in the
U.S.’s approach on safe, secure, and trustworthy AI.”</p>
<p>The order directs departments and agencies across the U.S. federal
government to develop policies aimed at placing guardrails alongside an
industry that is developing newer and more powerful systems at a pace
rate that has many concerned it will outstrip effective regulation.</p>
<p>“To realize the promise of AI and avoid the risk, we need to govern
this technology,” Biden said during a signing ceremony at the White
House. The order, he added, is “the most significant action any
government anywhere in the world has ever taken on AI safety, security
and trust.” </p>
<p>‘Red teaming’ for security </p>
<p>One of the marquee requirements of the new order is that it will
require companies developing advanced artificial intelligence systems to
conduct rigorous testing of their products to ensure that bad actors
cannot use them for nefarious purposes. The process, known as red
teaming, will assess, among other things, “AI systems threats to
critical infrastructure, as well as chemical, biological, radiological,
nuclear and cybersecurity risks.” </p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology will set the
standards for such testing, and AI companies will be required to report
their results to the federal government prior to releasing new products
to the public. The Departments of Homeland Security and Energy will be
closely involved in the assessment of threats to vital
infrastructure. </p>
<p>To counter the threat that AI will enable the creation and
dissemination of false and misleading information, including
computer-generated images and “deep fake” videos, the Commerce
Department will develop guidance for the creation of standards that will
allow computer-generated content to be easily identified, a process
commonly called “watermarking.” </p>
<p>The order directs the White House chief of staff and the National
Security Council to develop a set of guidelines for the responsible and
ethical use of AI systems by the U.S. national defense and intelligence
agencies.</p>
<p>Privacy and civil rights</p>
<p>The order proposes a number of steps meant to increase Americans’
privacy protections when AI systems access information about them. That
includes supporting the development of privacy-protecting technologies
such as cryptography and creating rules for how government agencies
handle data containing citizens’ personally identifiable
information.</p>
<p>However, the order also notes that the United States is currently in
need of legislation that codifies the kinds of data privacy protections
that Americans are entitled to. Currently, the U.S. lags far behind
Europe in the development of such rules, and the order calls on Congress
to “pass bipartisan data privacy legislation to protect all Americans,
especially kids.”</p>
<p>The order recognizes that the algorithms that enable AI to process
information and answer users’ questions can themselves be biased in ways
that disadvantage members of minority groups and others often subject to
discrimination. It therefore calls for the creation of rules and best
practices addressing the use of AI in a variety of areas, including the
criminal justice system, health care system and housing market.</p>
<p>The order covers several other areas, promising action on protecting
Americans whose jobs may be affected by the adoption of AI technology;
maintaining the United States’ market leadership in the creation of AI
systems; and assuring that the federal government develops and follows
rules for its own adoption of AI systems.</p>
<p>Open questions</p>
<p>Experts say that despite the broad sweep of the executive order, much
remains unclear about how the Biden administration will approach the
regulations of AI in practice.</p>
<p>Benjamin Boudreaux, a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, told
VOA that while it is clear the administration is “trying to really wrap
their arms around the full suite of AI challenges and risks,” much work
remains to be done.</p>
<p>“The devil is in the details here about what funding and resources go
to executive branch agencies to actually enact many of these
recommendations, and just what models a lot of the norms and
recommendations suggested here will apply to,” Boudreaux said.</p>
<p>International leadership</p>
<p>Looking internationally, the order says the administration will work
to take the lead in developing “an effort to establish robust
international frameworks for harnessing AI’s benefits and managing its
risks and ensuring safety.”</p>
<p>James A. Lewis, senior vice president and director of the strategic
technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, told VOA that the executive order does a good job of laying out
where the U.S. stands on many important issues related to the global
development of AI.</p>
<p>“It hits all the right issues,” Lewis said. “It’s not groundbreaking
in a lot of places, but it puts down the marker for companies and other
countries as to how the U.S. is going to approach AI.”</p>
<p>That’s important, Lewis said, because the U.S. is likely to play a
leading role in the development of the international rules and norms
that grow up around the technology.</p>
<p>“Like it or not — and certainly some countries don’t like it — we are
the leaders in AI,” Lewis said. “There’s a benefit to being the place
where the technology is made when it comes to making the rules, and the
U.S. can take advantage of that.”</p>
<p>‘Fighting the last war’ </p>
<p>Not all experts are certain the Biden administration’s focus is on
the real threats that AI might present to consumers and citizens. </p>
<p>Louis Rosenberg, a 30-year veteran of AI development and the CEO of
American tech firm Unanimous AI, told VOA he is concerned the
administration may be “fighting the last war.”</p>
<p>“I think it’s great that they’re making a bold statement that this is
a very important issue,” Rosenberg said. “It definitely shows that the
administration is taking it seriously and that they want to protect the
public from AI.”</p>
<p>However, he said, when it comes to consumer protection, the
administration seems focused on how AI might be used to advance existing
threats to consumers, like fake images and videos and convincing
misinformation — things that already exist today.</p>
<p>“When it comes to regulating technology, the government has a track
record of underestimating what’s new about the technology,” he said.</p>
<p>Rosenberg said he is more concerned about the new ways in which AI
might be used to influence people. For example, he noted that AI systems
are being built to interact with people conversationally.</p>
<p>“Very soon, we’re not going to be typing in requests into Google.
We’re going to be talking to an interactive AI bot,” Rosenberg said. “AI
systems are going to be really effective at persuading, manipulating,
potentially even coercing people conversationally on behalf of whomever
is directing that AI. This is the new and different threat that did not
exist before AI.”</p>

<h2 id="the-electric-vehicle-revolution-is-still-non-union">The Electric
Vehicle Revolution Is Still Non-Union</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-30, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDMzNDI5Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcwNDgyNDQxMn0.fmGFJzVuT5NCdTBD3cpH79dFZl7xNnXMZnQq2WE_0CA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps" style>
The United Auto Workers’ six-week strike has won large concessions from
the Big Three American automakers,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/the-uaw-strike-is-probably-over" target="_self">including
substantial wage hikes</a>.
</p>
<p style>
But in order to win the war over the future of unionized labor in the
auto industry, the UAW will need to do something even harder than
extracting raises from Ford, Stellantis, and GM: It will have to grow
the union by bringing foreign automaker and non-union workforces into
the UAW, something it has largely failed to accomplish. Today, it only
represents around 15% of the roughly one million autoworkers in the
United States.
</p>
<p style>
The UAW leadership had tread a narrow path on electrification. Its
president Shawn Fain has said he and the union support it, but the UAW
has harshly criticized the Biden administration
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/auto-union-harshly-criticizes-us-ford-joint-venture-battery-loan-2023-06-23/" target="_blank">when
subsidies go to non-union battery plants</a>. Conservatives have tried
to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/why-republicans-are-salivating-over-the-uaw-strike" target="_blank">drive
a wedge</a> between the UAW and the Democratic Party by arguing that
electrification will lead to American autoworkers being displaced by
cars and batteries from overseas.
</p>
<p style>
The UAW is well aware of the risk that electrification poses to its
workforce and it made demands during its strike accordingly. The union
won
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/uaw-gm-battery-plants-agreement" target="_self">an
important concession</a> around EVs, easing the way for battery plant
workers to be represented by the union, even though the plants are often
joint ventures. This means that the UAW’s presence within the Big Three
will not be fissured by the electrification of the American auto fleet.
And at Stellantis, the UAW
<a href="https://uaw.org/uaw-reaches-tentative-agreement-stellantis/" target="_blank">even
won a commitment</a> to add “over a thousand jobs” at a planned battery
plant in Belvidere, Illinois.
</p>
<p style>
But despite decades of trying, the union has failed to organize foreign
automakers’ factories in the South or Tesla, let alone startup electric
vehicle companies like Rivian. And it’s these automakers and these
regions that are seeing big increases in investment thanks to
government-encouraged electrification, with subsidies for the purchase
of vehicles made in the United States.
</p>
<p style>
The union has dismissed fretting from the Big Three — especially at Ford
— that a generous deal could make them uncompetitive compared to foreign
and non-union automakers.
</p>
<p style>
“The days of the UAW and Ford being a team to fight other companies are
over. We won’t be used in this phony competition. We will always and
forever be on the side of working people everywhere. Non-union
autoworkers are not the enemy, those are our future union family,” UAW
president Shawn Fain in live stream. “We’re going to organize non-union
auto companies like we’ve never organized before.”
</p>
<p style>
Any future organizing efforts will be an uphill battle for the UAW, but
one that offers large potential gains in membership and influence,
especially as the American auto sector electrifies.
</p>
<p style>
The bulk of American EV purchases are from non-union automakers. These
automakers are electrifying the fastest, and they’re also perfectly
happy to build these vehicles in the United States, taking advantage of
the nexus of subsidies and incentives to do so.
</p>
<p style>
About half of the EV market is controlled by Tesla,
<a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q3-2023-ev-sales/#:~:text=Electric%20vehicle%20sales%20accounted%20for,sales%20in%20the%20U.S.%20market." target="_blank">according
to Cox Automotive</a>, while traditional automakers with at least 10% of
their sales coming from EVs are all foreign. (Even though Ford sells the
second most electric vehicles, it only delivers about one tenth of what
Tesla does).
</p>
<p style>
In short, when someone in the U.S. buys an electric crossover or sedan,
they are likely buying from a non-union automaker. But when they buy a
pickup truck, there’s a good chance it rolled off a line worked by UAW
members.
</p>
<p style>
In the U.S., according to Kelly Blue Book, Tesla has sold 494,000 cars
in the first nine months of this year.
<a href="https://media.ford.com/content/dam/fordmedia/North%20America/US/2023/10/04/Q3%202023%20Sales%20Final%20Release.pdf" target="_blank">Ford,
by contrast, has sold 47,000 electric vehicles</a> so far this year and
GM has
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/689723/us-general-motors-bev-sales-2023q3/" target="_blank">sold
around 56,000 battery electric vehicles</a>. Stellantis doesn’t even
sell an all-electric car yet. (It has sold around 98,000
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/690620/us-stellantis-plugin-sales-2023q3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plug-in
hybrids this year</a> though.)
</p>
<p style>
During the first seven months of the year, only two of the top 10
battery-electric vehicles in the United States were made by the Big
Three, according to a Morgan Stanley report. These were Ford’s Mustang
Mach-E and the Chevrolet Bolt.
</p>
<p style>
Another two cars on the list — the Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe and Wrangler
4xe — are plug-in hybrids made by Stellantis.
</p>
<p style>
But the list was otherwise dominated by models — such as the Tesla Model
Y, Rivian R1T, and Hyundai Ioniq 5 — that are made either abroad or in a
non-union American factory. Most of those vehicles are nonetheless
eligible for some or all of a $7,500 federal subsidy for lease or
purchase.
</p>
<p style>
That deviates from what the Biden administration had once hoped. While
early drafts of what would become the Inflation Reduction Act restricted
tax credits to union-made vehicles, the provisions were stripped out at
the
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/toyota-investing-240-million-west-virginia-build-hybrid-parts-2021-11-11/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">insistence
of Joe Manchin</a>, the Democratic senator from West Virginia. (Toyota,
which is not unionized, operates an engine and transmission plant in his
state.)
</p>
<p style>
In other words, the majority of fully electric vehicles sold in America
today are not made by UAW members, and nothing about the country’s EV
policy per se will force that to change.
</p>
<p style>
And precisely because the U.S. auto industry is already heavily
non-union, any burst of new manufacturing will tend to flow to non-union
shops, which is largely what’s occurred as the American auto fleet
becomes electrified.
</p>
<p style>
Electric Volkswagens roll off the line in Chattanooga, while Tesla
churns out cars for the U.S. market in Fremont, California, and Austin,
Texas.

One Netbook has been cranking out handheld gaming PCs under the
ONEXPLAYER brand for a few years. But like most computers in this space,
they’ve tended to rely on integrated graphics rather than more powerful

<p>Apple released their first Quicktake camera, the Quicktake 100, in
1994, ten years after the Apple //c. On the box, they very boldly wrote:
“Requirements: 386, 486 or superior; 2MB of RAM, 10MB of free hard disk
space; an 1.44MB floppy drive; a VGA, SVGA or superior card”. But was
this true? No. They were just being lazy, or trying to get you to
upgrade a perfectly functional 8-bit, 1MHz computer with 128kB of RAM
and 140kB floppies. In fact, it was absolutely possible to do digital
photography on an Apple //c. Useless projects are the best projects.</p>

id="illinois-man-pleads-not-guilty-in-attack-on-muslim-mother-son">Illinois
Man Pleads Not Guilty in Attack on Muslim Mother, Son</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A man accused of murder, attempted murder and a hate crime in an
attack on a Palestinian American woman and her young son pleaded not
guilty Monday following his indictment by an Illinois grand jury. </p>
<p>Joseph Czuba, 71, is charged in the fatal stabbing of six-year-old
Wadea Al-Fayoume and the wounding of Hanaan Shahin on October 14.
Authorities said the victims were targeted because of their Muslim faith
and as a response to the war between Israel and Hamas. </p>
<p>Shahin told police that Czuba, her landlord in Plainfield in Will
County, was upset over the war and attacked them after she had urged him
to “pray for peace.” </p>
<p>Czuba appeared in court Monday wearing a red jail uniform, socks and
yellow rubber slippers. </p>
<p>His attorney George Lenard entered the not guilty plea after the
judge read the 8-count indictment. Czuba did not speak, looking down at
the podium with his hands folded behind his back as he stood before the
judge in the court in Joliet, 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of
Chicago. </p>
<p>Shahin, 32, is recovering from multiple stab wounds. Hundreds of
people attended her son’s funeral on October 16 where he was remembered
as an energetic boy who loved playing games. He had recently had a
birthday. </p>
<p>The boy’s father and other family members attended the hearing. They
declined to speak to reporters. </p>
<p>The murder charge in the indictment against Czuba describes the boy’s
death as the result of “exceptionally brutal or heinous behavior.” The
attack on the family — which renewed anti-Islamic fears in the Chicago
area’s large and established Palestinian community — has drawn
condemnation from the White House. </p>
<p>Judge David Carlson ruled that Czuba will remain detained as he
awaits a January 8 court hearing. </p>
<p>In arguing to keep Czuba detained, Will County Assistant State’s
Attorney Michael Fitzgerald said Czuba was a danger to Shahin and
others. </p>
<p>“We also believe he is a threat to the safety of the community,” he
said. </p>
<p>Czuba’s attorneys disagreed, citing Czuba’s age and the fact that he
is a veteran without any criminal convictions. </p>
<p>Lenard and Fitzgerald declined to comment to reporters after the
hearing. </p>
<p>Shahin asked the public to “pray for peace” and said her son was her
best friend in a statement issued last week through the Chicago chapter
of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. </p>
<p>The attack comes amid rising hostility against Muslim and Jewish
communities in the U.S. since Hamas attacked Israel.</p>

<h2 id="the-uaw-strike-is-probably-over">The UAW Strike Is Probably
Over</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-30, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDMzMzA4MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNjY1NDA0OX0.73CkVWoNV9KgRT3wXKYuBuQFuSgKcorbDBga1usdoVY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
The largest, longest strike among American autoworkers in decades is
probably over. On Monday, the United Auto Workers reached a tentative
agreement with General Motors, according to
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/30/business/gm-uaw-tentative-agreement/index.html">multiple</a>
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/gm-uaw-reach-new-tentative-labor-deal-to-end-strike-afe5e197">outlets</a>,
meaning that the union now has a deal with all of the “Big Three”
American automakers.
</p>
<p style>
While the terms of the GM deal haven’t been released, they will likely
resemble those in the UAW’s tentative contracts with Ford and
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/10/28/1209142735/uaw-strike-deal-gm-stellantis-ford-shawn-fain">Stellantis</a>,
which owns Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and Ram. Those two deals saw many
union members get a 25% pay bump, and they
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uaw-strike-update-ford-union-win/">eliminated</a>
a two-tier wage system at some factories that was put in place after the
Great Recession.
</p>
<p style>
The deals also seem to address some — but not all — of workers’ concerns
about the EV transition. The Ford deal will let UAW members ask to be
transferred to its new electric-vehicle and battery factories in
Stanton, Tennessee, and Marshall, Michigan,
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-29/ford-uaw-deal-includes-car-buying-voucher-higher-401-k-payment?utm_content=business&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&leadSource=uverify%20wall">according

</em>It will also let workers at that Tennessee plant — an EV-producing
“mega-campus” that will be the company’s largest facility ever — join
the UAW contract via a “card check,” a type of union election that
requires only that a majority of eligible workers sign union-membership
cards. Union organizers generally prefer “card check” elections, which
are considered simpler and easier to win, to standard union elections
administered by the National Labor Relations Board.<em></em>
</p>
<p style>
The UAW strike began 45 days ago. It is
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/uaw-strike-is-now-the-longest-in-25-years/">the
longest autoworker strike</a> in a quarter century, and the first time
in decades that the union struck at all three American companies
simultaneously.
</p>
<p style>
The strike won’t officially end until a majority of UAW members at each
company ratify their new contract. But the union has already asked
workers at Ford and Stellantis to return to work, and production at some
factories could
<a href="https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/uaw-strike-ford-gradually-resume-production-after-tentative-deal">resume</a>

Zuck’s gravity-defying metaverse money-pit (30 Oct 2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-30, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Zuck’s gravity-defying metaverse money-pit: $46.5
billion incinerated and he’s richer than ever. Hey look at this:
Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2003, 2008, 2013, 2018
Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current
writing projects, current reading Zuck’s gravity-defying metaverse
money-pit (permalink) Think of everything that makes you miserable as
being caught between two opposing, irresistible, irrefutable truths:
“Anything that can’t go on forever eventually stops” (Stein’s Law)
“Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent”
(Keynes) Both of these are true, even though they seemingly contradict
one another, and no one embodies that contradiction more perfectly than
Mark Zuckerberg. Take the metaverse. Zuck’s “pivot” to a virtual world
he ripped off from a quarter-century old cyberpunk novel (reminder:
cyberpunk is a warning, not a suggestion) was born of desperation. Zuck
fancies himself an avatar of the Emperor Augustus (that’s why he has
that haircut) (no, really). The emperors of antiquity are infamous for
getting all weepy when they run out of lands to conquer. But the
lachrymosity of emperors has little causal relationship to the anxieties
of tech monopolists! Alexander weeps because he just loves a good
conquest and when he finishes conquering the world, he’s terminally
bored. That’s not Zuck’s problem at all. When Zuck attains monopoly
status, his company develops an autoimmune disorder, as his vicious
princelings run out of enemies to destroy and begin to knife one
another. Any monopoly faces these destructive microincentives, but tech
is exceptional here because tech has the realtime flexibility and speed
that brick-and-mortar businesses can never match:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/twiddler/ Sociopaths with tech
monopolies are worse for the same reason that road-rage would be worse
in a flying car: adding new capacity to indiscriminate self-destructive
urges turns ordinary car crashes into low-level airburst warfare:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/28/microincentives-and-enshittification/
The flexibility of digital gives tech platforms so much latitude to
break things in tiny increments. A tech platform is like a Jenga tower
composed of infinitely divisible blocks. The Jenga players are the
product managers and executives who have run out of the ability to grow
by attracting new business thanks to their monopoly dominance. Now they
compete with one another to increase the yield from their respective
divisions by visiting pain upon the business customers and end users
their platform connects. By tiny increments, they increase the product’s
cost, lower its reliability, and strip it of its utility and then charge
rent to restore its functionality:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/24/cursed-bigness/#incentives-matter
This is the terminal stage of enshittification, the unstoppable
autocannibalism of platforms as they seek to harvest all the value
created by business customers and end users, leaving the absolute
minimum of residual value needed to keep both stuck to the platform.
This is a brittle equilibrium, because the difference between “I hate
this service but I just can’t stop using it,” and “Get me the fuck out
of here” is razor-thin. All it takes is one tiny push – a whistleblower,
a livestreamed mass-shooting, a Cambridge Analytica – and people bolt
for the doors. This triggers the final stage: the “pivot,” which is a
tech euphemism for “panic.” For Zuck, the pivot got real after a
disappointing earnings call triggered a mass sell-off of Facebook stock,
history’s worst one-day value incineration, which lopped a quarter of a
trillion dollars off the company’s market cap:
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-19/dramatic-stock-moves-of-2022-led-by-meta-dive-nordic-flash-crash
This was when the metaverse became the company’s top priority. Now, in
my theory of enshittification, the step that follows the pivot is death:
“Finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value
for themselves. Then, they die”:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys Many people
have asked me about the conspicuous non-death of Facebook! That’s where
I have to fall back on Stein’s Law: “Anything that can’t go on forever
eventually stops.” Facebook can’t continue to annihilate value, alienate
its workers, harm the public, hemorrhage money in support of a
mediocrity’s cherished folly forever. Can it? Admittedly, it sure seems
like it can. Facebook’s metaverse pivot has thus far cost the company
$46,500,000,000. That is: $46.5 billion. That’s even more money than
Uber torched, seeking to maintain the illusion that they will be able to
create monopolies on both transport and the labor market for driving and
recoup the billions the Saudi royal family let them use for the con:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/11/bezzlers-gonna-bezzle/#gryft Don’t
worry: the Saudi royals are fine! They cashed out at the IPO, collecting
a tidy profit at the expense of retail investors who assumed that a pile
of shit as big as Uber must have a pony under it, somewhere:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/19/fake-it-till-you-make-it/#millennial-lifestyle-subsidy
Uber has doubled the cost of rides and halved drivers’ wages, using
illegal gimmicks like “algorithmic wage discrimination” to squeeze a
little more juice out of the nearly exhausted husks of its workforce:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/12/algorithmic-wage-discrimination/#fishers-of-men
But Stein’s Law hasn’t been repealed. Drivers can’t drive for
sub-subsistence wages. Do that long enough and they’ll literally starve:
that’s what “subsistence” means. We lost a decade of transit investment
thanks to the Uber con, at the same time as traditional taxi drivers
were forced out of the industry. Uber can’t be profitable and still pay
a living wage, and the fantasy of self-driving cars as a means of
zeroing out the wage-bill altogether remains stubbornly, lethally
unworkable:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/09/herbies-revenge/#100-billion-here-100-billion-there-pretty-soon-youre-talking-real-money
Which means we’re at the point where you can get off a commuter train at
a main station and find yourself stranded: no taxis at the taxi-queue,
no busses due for an hour, and no Uber cars available unless you’re
willing to pay $95 for a ten-minute ride in a luxury SUV (why yes, this
did happen to me recently, thanks for asking). As more and more of us
are exposed to these micro-crises, the political will to do something
will increase. This can’t go on forever. “Don’t use commuter rail” isn’t
a viable option. “Walk three miles each way to the commuter rail
station” isn’t viable either. Neither is “Pay $95 for an Uber to get to
the station.” Something’s gotta give…eventually. “Eventually” is the key
word here. Remember the counterpoint to Stein’s Law: Keynes’s maxim that
“markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.”
Sure, anything that can’t go on forever eventually stops, but that is no
guarantee of a soft landing. You can’t smoke two packs a day forever –
but in the absence of smoking cessation, the eventual terminus of that
habit is stage-four lung cancer. Keep hammering butts into your face and
your last smoke will come out of a crematorium chimney. Zuckerberg
hasn’t merely blown a whole-ass Twitter on the metaverse with nothing to
show for it – he’s gotten richer while doing it! In the past year, his
net worth increased by 130%, to $59 billion, thanks to an increase in
Facebook’s share-price, driven by investors who stubbornly remain
irrational, keeping the Boy Emperor solvent long past any reasonable
assessment of his performance. What are these investors betting on? One
possibility is that the rise and rise of Facebook’s share-price
represents a bet on technofeudalism. Since the Communist Manifesto,
Marxists have been predicting the end of capitalism. That end seems to
have come, but what followed capitalism wasn’t socialism, it was the
return of feudalism, an economic system where elites derive their wealth
from rents, not profits:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/28/cloudalists/#cloud-capital Profit is
the income you get from investing in capital – machinery, systems, plant
– and then harvesting the surplus value created by workers who mobilize
this capital. Capitalism produces massive returns for its winners – in
the Manifesto’s first chapter, Marx and Engels just geek out about how
productive and dynamic this system is. But capitalism is also a Red
Queen’s Race, where the winners have to run faster and faster to stay in
the same place. Capitalism drives competition, as other would-be winners
pile into the sector, replicating the systems that the current winners
are using and then improving on them. This is why the prophets of
capitalist end-times like the FBI informant Peter Thiel say that
“competition is for losers.” Capitalism’s “profits” stand in contrast to
the feudalist’s “rents.” Rents are income you get from owning something
that other people need to produce things. The capitalist owns the
coffee-shop, but the feudalist owns the building. When a rival
capitalist opens a superior coffee-shop and drives the old shop out of
business, the capitalist loses, but the rentier wins. Now they can rent
out an empty storefront in the neighborhood everyone’s coming to because
of that hot new cafe. Feudal and manorial lords also made their fortunes
by extracting surplus value from workers, but these rentiers don’t care
about owning the means of production. The peasant in the field pays for
their own agricultural equipment and livestock – control over the means
of production is necessary for worker liberation, but it’s not
sufficient. The worker’s co-op that owns its factory can still find the
value it produces bled off by the landlord who owns the land the factory
sits on. The jury’s still out on whether American workers really see
themselves as “temporarily embarrassed millionaires,” but America’s
capitalists have a palpable, undeniable loathing for capitalism. The
dream of an American “entrepreneur” is passive income: money you get
from owning something capitalists and/or workers use to create value.
Digital technology creates exciting new possibilities for
rent-extraction: a taxi-operator had to buy and maintain a car that
someone else drove. Uber can offload this hassle onto its drivers and
rent out access to the chokepoint it created between drivers and riders,
charging all the traffic can bear. This is feudalism in the cloud – or
as Yannis Varoufakis calls it, cloudalism. In Varoufakis’s
Technofeudalism, he describes Amazon as a feudal venture. From a
distance, Amazon seems like a bustling marketplace of manic capitalism,
with sellers avidly competing to offer more variety and lower costs in a
million independently operated storefronts. But closer inspection
reveals that Amazon is a planned economy, not a market. Every one of
those storefronts pays rent to the same landlord – Amazon – which
determines which goods can be offered for sale. Amazon sets pricing for
those goods, and extracts 45-51% of every dollar those sellers make.
Amazon even controls which goods are shelved at eye-height when you
enter the store, and which ones are banished to a dusty storeroom in a
distant sub-basement you’ll never find:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/06/14/flywheel-shyster-and-flywheel/#unfulfilled-by-amazon
Zuck’s metaverse is pure-play technofeudalism, Amazon taken to the
logical extreme. It’s easy to get distracted by the part of Zuck’s
vision that will convert us all into legless, sexless, heavily
surveilled low-resolution cartoon characters. But the real action isn’t
this digitization of our fleshy wants and needs. Zuck didn’t spend
$46.5B to torment us. The cruelty isn’t the point of the metaverse. The
point of the metaverse is to rent us out to capitalists. Zuck doesn’t
know why we would use the metaverse, but he believes that if he can
convince capitalists that we all want to live there, that they’ll invest
the capital to figure out how to serve us there, and then he can extract
rent from those capitalists and start earning “passive income.” It’s an
Uber for Cyberpunk Dystopias play. Zuck’s done this before. Remember the
“pivot to video?” Zuckerberg wanted to compete with Youtube, but he
didn’t want to invest in paying for video production. Videos are really
expensive to produce and the median video gets zero views. So Zuck used
his captive audience to trick publishers into financing his move into
video. He fraudulently told publishers that videos were blowing up on
Facebook, outperforming boring old text by vast margins. Publishers
borrowed billions and raised billions more in the capital markets,
financing the total conversion of newsrooms from text to video and
precipitating a mass extinction event for print journalists. Zuck kept
the con alive by giving away (fewer) billions to some of those
publishers, falsely claiming that their videos were generating fortunes
in advertising revenue. These lucky, credulous publishers became judas
goats for their industry, luring others into the con, the same way that
the “lucky” guy a carny lets win a giant teddy-bear at the start of the
day lures others into putting down $5 to see if they can sink three
balls in a rigged peach-basket. But when we stubbornly refused to watch
videos on Facebook, Zuck stopped spreading around these convincer
payouts, and precipitated a second mass-extinction event in news media,
as the new generation of video journalists joined their predecessors in
Facebook-driven unemployment. Given this history, it’s surreal to see
publishers continue to insist that Facebook is stealing their content,
when it is so clearly stealing their money:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/saving-news-big-tech Metaverse is
the new Pivot to Video. Zuckerberg is building a new world, which he
will own, and he wants to rent it to capitalists, who will compete with
one another in just the way that Amazon’s sellers compete. No matter who
wins that competition, Zuckerberg will win. The prize for winning will
be a rent increase, as Zuckerberg leverages the fact that your
“successful” business relies on Facebook’s metaverse to drain off all
the value your workers have produced:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/18/metaverse-means-pivot-to-video/ This
can’t last forever, but how long until Zuck’s reality distortion field
runs out of battery? That’s the $46.5B question. The market can
certainly remain irrational for a hell of a long time. But the market
isn’t the only force that regulates corporate outcomes. Regulators also
regulate. Europe’s GDPR is now seven years old, and it plainly outlaws
Facebook’s surveillance. For nearly a decade, Facebook has pretended
that this wasn’t true, and they got away with it. Mostly, that’s thanks
to the fact that Ireland is a corporate crime-haven with a
worse-than-useless Data Protection Commission:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/15/finnegans-snooze/#dirty-old-town But
anything that can’t go on forever will eventually stop. Facebook has
finally been dragged into EU federal jurisdiction, where it will face
exterminatory fines if it continues to spy on Europeans:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/07/luck-of-the-irish/#schrems-revenge In
response, Facebook has rolled out a subscription version of its main
service and its anticompetitive acquisition, Instagram:
https://about.fb.com/news/2023/10/facebook-and-instagram-to-offer-subscription-for-no-ads-in-europe/
For €10/month, Facebook will give you an ad-free experience across its
service offerings (it’s €13/month if you pay through an app, as Facebook
recoups the 30% #AdTax rents that the feudal Google/Apple mobile duopoly
extracts). But this doesn’t come close to satisfying Facebook’s legal
obligations under the GDPR. The GDPR doesn’t ban ads, it bans spying.
Facebook spies on every single internet user, all the time. The apps we
use are built with “free” Facebook toolkits that extract rent from the
capitalists who make them by harvesting our data as we use their apps.
The web-pages we visit have embedded Facebook libraries that do the same
thing for web publishers. Facebook buys our data from brokers. Facebook
has so many ways of spying on us that there’s almost certainly no way
for Facebook to stop spying on you, without radically transforming it
operation. To comply with the GDPR, Facebook must halt surveillance
advertising altogether. There’s no way to square “spying on users” with
“you can’t surveil without explicit consent, and you can’t punish people
for refusing.” And of course, “not spying” isn’t the same as “not
advertising.” “Contextual advertising” – where ads are placed based on
the thing you’re looking at, not who you are and what you do – is
hundreds of years old. Context ads underperform surveillance ads by a
slim margin – about 5% – but they’re vastly more profitable for
publishers. That’s because surveillance ads are feudal, controlled by
rentiers like Facebook, who own vast troves of the surveillance data
needed to run these ads. Traditional ad intermediaries (agencies,
brokers) took 10-15% out of the total advertising market. Ad-tech
companies – the Google/Facebook duopoly – take 51% out of every ad
dollar spent. Eliminate surveillance ads and you torch their feudal
estates. Facebook will always know more about someone reading a news
article than the publisher – but the publisher will always know more
about the article than Facebook does:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/05/save-news-we-must-ban-surveillance-advertising
There are rents under capitalism, just as there are profits under
feudalism. The defining characteristic of a system is what happens when
rents and profits come into conflict. If profits win – for example, if
productive companies beat patent trolls, or if news publishers escape
Facebook’s rent-extraction – then the system is capitalist. If rents win
– if investors continue to bet large on the metaverse as its losses pass
$50 billion and head for the $100 billion mark – then the system is
feudal. Anything that can’t go on forever will eventually stop. The
question isn’t whether the platforms will eventually become so
enshittified that they die – the question is whether they will go down
in an all-consuming fireball, or whether they’ll go down in a controlled
demolition that lets us evacuate the people they’ve trapped inside them

id="us-consumers-keep-spending-despite-high-prices-and-their-own-gloomy-outlook">US
Consumers Keep Spending Despite High Prices and their Own Gloomy
Outlook</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A flow of recent data from the U.S. government has made one thing
strikingly clear: A surge in consumer spending is fueling strong growth,
demonstrating a resilience that has confounded economists, Federal
Reserve officials and even the sour sentiments that Americans themselves
have expressed in opinion polls.</p>
<p>Spending by consumers rose by a brisk 0.4% in September the
government said Friday — even after adjusting for inflation and even as
Americans face ever-higher borrowing costs.</p>
<p>Economists caution that such vigorous spending isn’t likely to
continue in the coming months. Many households have been pulling money
from a shrinking pool of savings. Others have been turning increasingly
to credit cards. And the additional savings that tens of millions of
households amassed during the pandemic — from stimulus aid and reduced
opportunities to travel, dine out and visit entertainment venues — are
nearly depleted, economists say.</p>
<p>Still, the truth is no one knows where things go from here, given the
unusual nature of the post-pandemic economy. The “death of the consumer”
and an ensuing recession have been forecast by most economists for at
least a year. So far, not only is no recession in sight but consumers as
a whole appear to be in robust health. Spending might cool in the coming
months, yet it’s far from clear it will collapse.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the government said the economy accelerated at a 4.9%
annual rate in the July-September quarter, the fastest such rate since
2021, on the back of a jump in Americans’ spending. People spent on used
cars and restaurant meals, airfares and hotel rooms. Much of it, even
after adjusting for higher prices, was for discretionary items that
suggested that many people feel confident in their finances and job
security.</p>
<p>The durability of that spending has caught the attention of Fed
officials, who have signaled that they will keep their key interest rate
unchanged when they meet this week. But they’ve also made clear that
they are monitoring the economic data for any sign that inflation could
reignite and require further rate hikes.</p>
<p>“I have been consistently surprised at the resilience of consumer
spending,” Christopher Waller, an influential member of the Fed’s board,
said in a speech this month.</p>
<p>In the meantime, businesses, especially those in the sprawling
service sector, are benefiting from what still appears to be pent-up
demand, likely driven by higher-income earners, after the restrictions
of the pandemic. Last week, Royal Caribbean Group reported robust
quarterly earnings. Travelers crowded their cruise ships and spent more
even as the company raised prices.</p>
<p>“The acceleration of consumer spending on experiences [has] propelled
us towards another outstanding quarter,” said CEO Jason Liberty.
“Looking ahead, we see accelerating demand.”</p>
<p>So what’s behind the outsize gains, so far? Economists point to
several drivers: Sturdy hiring and low unemployment, along with healthy
finances for most households emerging from the pandemic. Wealthier
households, in particular, have enjoyed substantial growth in home
values and stock portfolios, which are likely juicing their
spending.</p>
<p>Steady hiring has sent the unemployment rate down to a
near-five-decade low of 3.8% and lifted to a record high the proportion
of women in their prime working years — ages 25 through 54 — who are
employed. Measures of layoffs are near historical lows. More jobs mean
more income, which generally means more spending.</p>
<p>“We continue to believe that you shouldn’t bet against the consumer
until actual job losses are on the horizon,” said Tim Duy, chief U.S.
economist at SGH Macro Advisers.</p>
<p>In the July-September quarter, Americans ramped up spending on
durable goods — furniture, appliances, jewelry and luggage — that people
typically cut back on if they’re worried about their jobs or the
economy.</p>
<p>With inflation slowing — it’s at a still-high 3.7%, down from a peak
of 9.1% in June 2022 — average wages are starting to outpace price
gains. By some measures, wage growth hasn’t yet fully offset the
inflation surge that began in 2021. But since late last year, pay has
risen faster than prices, likely fueling some spending.</p>
<p>In many lower-paying industries, like hotels, restaurants and
warehouses, companies have struggled to find and keep workers and have
raised pay accordingly. Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter,
calculates that for the lowest-paid 10% of workers, wages have jumped
25% since the first quarter of 2020, when the pandemic began. That’s
well ahead of the 18% increase in prices over that time.</p>
<p>And most households started 2023 in better shape than they were in
before the pandemic erupted, according to a report from the Fed. The net
worth of the median household — the midpoint between the richest and
poorest — jumped 37% from 2019 through 2022 as home prices shot higher
and the stock market rose. That was the biggest surge on records dating
back more than 30 years.</p>
<p>Most of the savings that Americans have accumulated in the past three
years have flowed to the wealthiest households, who have splurged on
travel and other experiences. Typically, economists say, the wealthiest
one-fifth of Americans account for about two-fifths of all spending.</p>
<p>The net worth of the richest one-tenth of households leaped by $28
trillion — or about one-third — from the first quarter of 2020 to the
second quarter of 2023, according to the Fed. The poorer one-half of
Americans gained a bigger percentage increase but in total dollars much
less, from about $2 trillion to $3.6 trillion. (Those figures aren’t
adjusted for inflation.)</p>
<p>“When wealth is growing by the amount that it has been the past three
years … I do think that it’s playing a larger role in this spending
strength than maybe we thought it would,” said Sarah Wolfe, U.S.
economist at Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>Small-business owners like Bret Csencsitz, managing partner of Gotham
Restaurant in New York City, can attest to that. High-dollar spending by
middle-age customers has helped replace many of his older patrons who
moved out of the city during COVID. These customers, who typically work
in technology and finance, are buying $150 to $200 bottles of wine and
spending a little over $200 on steak for two.</p>
<p>The average per-person check is up over 20% to roughly $145 compared
with the pre-pandemic days, he added, and he has had groups of up to 60
people holding dinners at his restaurant.</p>
<p>“People are back,” he said. “There’s more energy.”</p>
<p>Aditya Bhave, senior economist at Bank of America, noted that the
spending isn’t all driven by the affluent. Spending on the bank’s credit
and debit cards by households with incomes below $50,000 has risen
faster than spending by higher-earning clients.</p>
<p>Some Americans, while keeping a close watch on their finances, still
feel they have room to indulge themselves. Consider Valerie Zaffina, a
74-year-old retired teacher who was picking up a piece of jewelry last
week at a Kohl’s store in Ramsey, New Jersey. She said she and her
husband live on fixed incomes and are cautious spenders.</p>
<p>But Zaffina has nevertheless decided on one big splurge — about
$5,000 to decorate her rental apartment, including a $2,500 couch and a
$600 rug. It’s her first major decorating project in 18 years.</p>
<p>“I had kind of a frustrating year, and I wanted to do something for
myself,” she said. “So, yeah, I’m redecorating. I’m in the throes of
that, but I’m sticking to a budget.”</p>
<p>Many analysts still warn of a new crop of headwinds facing consumers
and the economy. Nearly 30 million student loan borrowers had to start
paying their loans this month, for example. And government dysfunction
in Washington could lead to a government shutdown next month.</p>
<p>A report Friday showed that while inflation-adjusted income fell last
month along with the savings rate, consumers still ramped up their
spending. That trend, economists say, is unsustainable.</p>
<p>Even so, those challenges may not prove as damaging as feared.
Student loan payments, for example, jumped even before an Oct. 1
deadline for resuming them, Bhave noted. And few borrowers appear to
have taken advantage of a 12-month grace period the Biden administration
put in place, suggesting that most borrowers can afford to resume paying
the money back — at least for now.</p>
<p>And executives at Visa, which reported strong earnings and a surge of
spending by their U.S. credit card customers overseas in the third
quarter, have also downplayed the likely impact of student loan
repayments.</p>
<p>The company isn’t “factoring in any impacts” from loan repayments
“because we’ve yet to see any meaningful impact,” said Visa’s chief
financial officer, Christopher Suh. “Consumer spending across all
segments from high to low has remained stable since March.”</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of gloom and doom,” around the consumer, Bhave said.
“And yet the data keep surprising to the upside.”</p>

<h2 id="these-us-states-have-the-happiest-workers">These US States Have
the Happiest Workers</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>All About America explores American culture, politics, trends,
history, ideals and places of interest.</p>
<p>Alaska workers are the happiest in the nation, thanks in part to
higher wages and shorter workweeks, according to a new report from
SelectSoftware Reviews, a human resource platform.</p>
<p>Researchers looked at several factors to come up with their list,
including wages, quit rates, commute times, work hours, injuries and
paid time off.</p>
<p>Alaska employees enjoy average workweeks of 31.3 hours, average
annual salaries of $52,000 and an overall job satisfaction score of
69.96 out of 100.</p>
<p>Job satisfaction is critical to happiness, according to Miriam Liss,
professor of psychology at the University of Mary Washington in
Fredericksburg, Virginia.</p>
<p>“A meaningful job allows you to feel competence and ability, able to
do the tasks that are meaningful to you,” Liss says. “If you’re having a
more meaningful, purposeful life, you are going to experience
pleasure.”</p>
<p>Other states with the happiest workers include Rhode Island, North
Dakota, Colorado and Minnesota, according to the report.</p>
<p>Second place Rhode Island has a low quit rate, and the lowest injury
rate of any state. North Dakota, which came in third, has an annual wage
of $47,400 and an average commute of just 17.6 minutes.</p>
<p>The unhappiest workers are in Georgia, Texas, Florida, South Carolina
and New York.</p>
<p>Georgia has the lowest job satisfaction, with an overall score of
29.62. Texas has the second-longest average workweek of 43.6 hours. In
Florida, the average worker earns $18 per hour compared with Alaskans,
who earn $32 per hour. Meanwhile, South Carolina workers make $13,000
less in annual salary than people in Alaska.</p>
<p>“Experiencing poverty definitely can make you unhappy,” Liss says,
“because your basic needs aren’t met … and you don’t have the ability to
have a lifestyle that gives you some autonomy, allows you to make
choices.”</p>
<p>New York, which has the longest commute time of any state, came in
fifth on the list of unhappiest workers.</p>
<p>“These results demonstrate the considerable impact a location can
have on how workers feel about their job, whether that is due to state
laws, commute times, or wages,” the report said. “It emphasizes the
importance for employers to create environments where employees find
genuine fulfillment and can thrive.”</p>

id="anti-aliasing-and-subpixel-allocation-and-how-its-all-going-away">Anti-aliasing
and subpixel allocation and how it’s all going away</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-30, from: Liam on Linux</p>
<p>There used to be multiple ways to try to smooth out text on screen.
Most are no longer relevant.<br /><br />XP used several such methods
quite heavily, such as font antialiasing and hinting.<br /><br />1. Font
antialiasing: using grey pixels that are not 100% on/off to soften the
edges of screen fonts on portions of letters that are not vertical or
horizontal, and therefore are stepped ("aliased"). First OS to do this
was Acorn RISC OS in the 1980s. By the mid-1990s Windows started to
catch up using greyscale pixels.<br /><br />2. Subpixel allocation (used
heavily in Windows in the 20x0s). This takes advantage of knowledge of
the display screen type, acquired through more sophisticated (that is,
bigger and slower) display systems. Pixels are not 1 colour dot. They
are a group of a red dot, a green dot, and a blue dot, working
together.<br /><br />CRT displays used triangular or other shaped grids
of R/G/B pixels. Sony Trinitron CRTs used stripes of R/G/B pixels
because their [shadow
mask](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_mask">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_mask</a>)
was a grille not a grid of holes. The then-new active matrix colour LCDs
have R/G/B pixels turned on and off individually (that’s what "active
matrix" means, 1 transistor per pixel, as opposed to 1 transistor per
rows and 1 per column, where the intersection goes on or
off).<br /><br />Subpixel allocation is antialiasing using R, G and B
pixels where the arrangement of the individual colour pixels is known to
the renderer. It is colour antialiasing but it doesn’t work right if,
for example, the pixels
are:<br /><br /><code>R B G</code><br /><br />But the renderer thinks
they are <br /><br /><code>B R G</code><br /><br />3. Running displays
at non-native resolutions used to break this. CRTs do not have a single
fixed native res. LCDs all do. Standard definition (SD) LCDs have, for
example, 1024×768 pixels, or 1280×1024. Later, hi-def (HD) ones have
more than you can easily see, e.g. my iMac’s 2nd screen is 2560×1440
pixels on a 27" LCD. You’d often run this at 1.5× or so
zoom<br /><br />Now, HiDPI displays have way more than even that. My
iMac’s built in screen is 27" but 5120×2880. <br /><br />You can’t use a
HiDPI ("retina") screen at its native res: letters would be too small to
see. They always run at 2× or 2.5× or even weird ratios like 3.33×.
<br /><br />There is no longer a linear relationship between pixels the
display has and pixels you see, because they’re too small to see any
more. So it’s OK to have a resolution that means 6 pixels per dot in
places and 7 in others because you can’t see individual pixels except
with a [hand
lens](<a href="https://extension.psu.edu/a-brief-guide-to-hand-lenses">https://extension.psu.edu/a-brief-guide-to-hand-lenses</a>)
so you don’t see fringing and aliasing.<br /><br />It is meaningful to
talk about having no subpixel smoothing or hinting on an SD screen where
you can see pixels, but it’s all more or less gone away now, because
it’s all programmatically curves on pixel-oriented displays where there
are no visible pixels any more. <br /><br />Ever since the iPhone 6
series, AFAIK, iOS devices <em>never</em> run at 1:1  native res
<em>or</em> 1:x ratios. The actual display res is almost unrelated to
the lower res the OS runs the screen at and there’s never a linear
relationship between logical display pixels and actual hardware screen
dots.<br /><br />So the 1990s stuff about antialiasing has gone away
now. At a microscopic scale it’s all blurred out but the blurring is at

University Receives Antisemitic Threats</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Cornell University has notified the FBI about antisemitic threats
directed at the school’s Jewish community.</p>
<p>The threats were on an online discussion board not associated with
the Ithaca, New York school.</p>
<p>The posts, according to The New York Times, included threats to shoot
Jewish students and also encouraged shooting the students.</p>
<p>The address of the school’s Center for Jewish Living where some
students live was posted online.  The posts also called for the center
to be torn down.  </p>
<p>“Threats of violence are absolutely intolerable, and we will work to
ensure that the person or people who posted them are punished to the
full extent of the law,” Cornell President Martha E. Pollack said in the
statement.</p>
<p>The posts come in the wake of Israel’s declaration of war on Gaza
that has erupted political divisions across the globe.</p>
<p>“We will not tolerate antisemitism at Cornell,” Pollack said in her
statement.  “This incident highlights the need to combat the forces that
are dividing us and driving us toward hate.”</p>

Although Åland is part of the Republic of Finland, it has its own

id="love-it-or-hate-it-feelings-run-high-over-candy-corn-come-halloween">Love
It or Hate It, Feelings Run High Over Candy Corn Come Halloween</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Cruel joke for trick-or-treaters or coveted seasonal delight? The
great Halloween debate over candy corn is on.</p>
<p>In the pantheon of high-emotion candy, the classic shiny tricolor
kernels in autumn’s white, orange and yellow are way up there. Fans and
foes alike point to the same attributes: its plastic or candle-like
texture (depending on who you ask) and the mega-sugar hit it packs.</p>
<p>“I am vehemently pro candy corn. It’s sugar! What is not to love?
It’s amazing. It’s like this waxy texture. You get to eat it once a
year. It’s tricolor. That’s always fun,” comedian Shannon Fiedler gushed
on TikTok. “Also, I know it’s disgusting. Candy corn is objectively kind
of gross, but that’s what makes it good.”</p>
<p>Or, as Paul Zarcone of Huntington, New York, put it: “I love candy
corn even though it looks like it should taste like a candle. I also
like that many people hate it. It makes me like it even more!”</p>
<p>Love it or loathe it, market leader Brach’s churns out roughly 30
million pounds of candy corn for the fall season each year, or enough to
circle planet Earth about five times, the company says. Last year, that
amounted to $75 million of $88.5 million in candy corn sales, according
to the consumer research firm Circana.</p>
<p>When compared to top chocolate sellers and other popular confections,
candy corn is niche. But few other candies have seeped into the culture
quite like these pointy little sugar bombs.</p>
<p>While other sweets have their haters (we’re looking at you Peeps,
Circus Peanuts and Brach’s Peppermint Christmas Nougats), candy corn has
launched a world of memes on social media. It inspires home decor and
fashion. It has its knitters and crocheters, ombre hairdos, makeup
enthusiasts and nail designs.</p>
<p>And it makes its way into nut bowls, trail mixes, atop cupcakes and
into Rice Krispie treats. Vans put out a pair of shoes emblazoned with
candy corn, Nike used its color design for a pair of Dunks, and
Kellogg’s borrowed the flavor profile for a version of its Corn Pops
cereal.</p>
<p>Singer-actor Michelle Williams is a super fan. She recorded a song
last year for Brach’s extolling her love.</p>
<p>As consumers rave or rage, Brach’s has turned to fresh mixes and
flavors over the years. A Turkey Dinner mix appeared in 2020 and lasted
two years. It had a variety of kernels that tasted like green beans,
roasted bird, cranberry sauce, stuffing, apple pie and coffee.</p>
<p>It won’t be back.</p>
<p>“I would say that it was newsworthy but perhaps not
consumption-worthy,” said Katie Duffy, vice president and general
manager of seasonal candy and the Brach’s brand for parent Ferrara Candy
Co.</p>
<p>The universe of other flavors has included s’mores, blueberry, cotton
candy, lemon-lime, chocolate and, yes, pumpkin spice. Nerds, another
Ferrara brand, has a hard-shell version.</p>
<p>It’s unclear when candy corn was invented. Legend has it that
Wunderle Candy Co. in Philadelphia first produced it in 1888 in
collaboration with a longtime employee, George Renninger. It was called,
simply, Butter Cream, with one type named Chicken Corn. That made sense
in an agrarian-society kind of way.</p>
<p>Several years later, the Goelitz Confectionery Co., now Jelly Belly,
began to produce candy corn, calling it Chicken Feed. Boxes were adorned
with a rooster logo and the tagline: “Something worth crowing for.“
Brach’s began candy corn production in 1920.</p>
<p>Today, kids delight in stacking candy corn in a circle, points in, to
create corncob towers. As for nutrition, 19 candy corns amount to about
140 calories and 28 grams of sugar. To be fair, many other Halloween
candy staples are in the same ballpark.</p>
<p>Ingredient-wise, it couldn’t be more straightforward. Candy corn is
basically sugar, corn syrup, confectioner’s glaze, salt, gelatin, honey
and dyes, among some other things.</p>
<p>“It’s not any sweeter than a lot of other candy, and I’ve tasted
every candy there is,” said Richard Hartel, who teaches candy science at
the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p>
<p>Hartel’s students spend time in the lab making candy. The candy corn
lab is among his most popular, he said, because it’s fun to make. His
unscientific poll of the nine seniors who last made candy corn turned up
no strong feelings either way on actually eating it.</p>
<p>“It’s the flavor, I think, that puts some people off. It sort of
tastes like butter and honey. And some people don’t like the texture,
but it’s really not that much different than the center of a
chocolate-covered butter cream,” he said.</p>
<p>Candy corn fans have their nibbling rituals.</p>
<p>Margie Sung is a purist. She’s been partial since childhood to the
original tricolor kernels. She eats them by color, starting with the
white tip, accompanied by a warm cup of tea or coffee.</p>
<p>“To this day, I swear the colors taste different,” she laughed.</p>
<p>Fact check: No, according to Duffy.</p>
<p>Don’t get people started on Brach’s little orange pumpkin candies
with the green tops. That’s a whole other conversation.</p>
<p>“The candy pumpkins? Disgusting,” said the 59-year-old Sung, who
lives in New York. “Too dense, too sweet, not the right
consistency.”</p>
<p>She likes her candy corn “borderline stale for a better consistency.”
Sung added: “Unfortunately, I can’t eat too many because I’m a Type 2
diabetic.” </p>
<p>Aaron Sadler, the 46-year-old spokesman for the city of Little Rock,
Arkansas, and its mayor, doesn’t share his candy corn. He keeps stashes
at home and in a desk drawer at his office.</p>
<p>“My fiancee can’t stand that I like candy corn,” he said. “I buy it
and I get this look of disdain but I don’t care. I just keep plugging
on.”</p>
<p>Sadler has been a partaker since childhood. How does he describe the
texture and flavor? “Sugary bliss.”</p>
<p>He’ll keep buying candy corn until mid-November.</p>
<p>“It’s 50% off after Halloween. Of course I’m going to buy it,” Sadler
chuckled. </p>
<p>After Thanksgiving, he’ll move on to his Christmas candy, York
Peppermint Patties. And for Valentine’s Day? Sadler is all about the
candy Conversation Hearts.</p>
<p>And then there are the hoarders. They freeze candy corn for
year-round consumption. Others will only eat it mixed with dry roasted
peanuts or other salty combinations.</p>
<p>“My ratio is 2 to 3 peanuts to 1 piece of candy corn. That’s the only
way I eat it,” said Lisa Marsh, who lives in New York and is in her 50s.
She stores candy corn in glass jars for year-round pleasure.</p>
<p>To the haters, 71-year-old fan Diana Peacock of Grand Junction,
Colorado, scolded: “They’re nuts. How can they not like it?”</p>
<p>Au contraire, Jennifer Walker fights back. The 50-year-old Walker,
who lives in Ontario, Canada, called candy corn “big ole lumps of dyed
sugar. There’s no flavor.”</p>
<p>Her Ontario compatriot in Sault Ste. Marie, Abby Obenchain, also
isn’t a fan. She equates candy corn with childhood memories of having to
visit her pediatrician, who kept a bowl on hand.</p>
<p>“A bowl of candy corn looks to me like a bowl of old teeth, like
somebody pulled a bunch of witch’s teeth out,” said Obenchain, 63.</p>
<p>Candy corn isn’t just a candy, said 29-year-old Savannah Woolston in
Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>“I’m a big fan of mentally getting into each season, and I feel like
candy corn is in the realm of pumpkin spice lattes and fall sweaters,”
she said. “And I will die on the hill that it tastes good.”</p>

Urges Israel to Protect Civilians, Increase Aid to Gaza</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The United States on Sunday pressed Israel to protect civilians in
Gaza and pushed for an immediate increase in humanitarian aid, amid a
growing outcry over the human costs of Israel’s three-week bombardment
of the enclave.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu in a call
that Israel has a right to defend itself and should do so in a way that
is consistent with international law on protecting civilians, the White
House said.</p>
<p>Biden and Netanyahu discussed efforts to protect the more than 200
hostages seized by Palestinian Hamas militants in a surprise attack on
Israel on Oct. 7 that killed 1,400 people.</p>
<p>The White House said Biden also “underscored the need to immediately
and significantly increase the flow of humanitarian assistance to meet
the needs of civilians in Gaza,” as supplies dwindle in the besieged
coastal enclave.</p>
<p>With the death toll in the Gaza Strip in the thousands and climbing,
Biden’s administration has been under increasing pressure to make clear
that its steadfast support of Israel does not translate into a blanket
endorsement of all that its ally is doing in the impoverished
enclave.</p>
<p>In television interviews earlier on Sunday, White House national
security adviser Jake Sullivan said Israel has a responsibility to
protect the lives of innocent people in Gaza.</p>
<p>Washington was asking hard questions of Israel, including on issues
surrounding humanitarian aid, distinguishing between terrorists and
innocent civilians and on how Israel is thinking through its military
operation, Sullivan said.</p>
<p>“What we believe is that every hour, every day of this military
operation, the IDF (Israel Defense Forces), the Israeli government
should be taking every possible means available to them to distinguish
between Hamas terrorists who are legitimate military targets and
civilians who are not,” he said on CNN.</p>
<p>Sullivan also said Netanyahu has a responsibility to “rein in”
extremist Jewish settlers in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. “It is
totally unacceptable to have extremist settler violence against innocent
people in the West Bank,” he said.</p>
<p>Biden is facing pressure from within his own Democratic Party to call
for a cease-fire.</p>
<p>As Israel’s largest military backer, the United States bears some
responsibility for its actions in Gaza, U.S. Representative Pramila
Jayapal, leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said on NBC’s
“Meet the Press.”</p>
<p>“We are losing credibility,” Jayapal said. “And, frankly, we’re being
isolated in the rest of the world.”</p>
<p>The attack from Gaza’s Hamas rulers unleashed a wave of aerial
bombardment from Israel and an incipient ground operation.</p>
<p>Medical authorities in the Gaza Strip, which has a population of 2.3
million people, say more than 8,000 Palestinians have been killed in
Israel’s campaign to obliterate Iran-backed Hamas.</p>
<p>Hamas militants have embedded themselves among the Palestinian
population and in civilian infrastructure, making an operation against
them extremely difficult, Sullivan said.</p>
<p>“That creates an added burden for Israel, but it does not lessen
Israel’s responsibility under international humanitarian law, to
distinguish between terrorists and civilians, and to protect the lives
of innocent people, and that is the overwhelming majority of the people
in Gaza,” Sullivan said.</p>
<p>With supplies of food, water and medicines running low, thousands of
Gaza residents broke into U.N. warehouses and distribution centers to
get food.</p>
<p>There has been a mounting international outcry over the toll from the
bombing and growing calls for a “humanitarian pause” to allow aid to
reach Gaza civilians.</p>
<p>In an interview on CBS, Sullivan was asked if there was “daylight”
between the United States and the Netanyahu government, Sullivan
responded, ““We talk candidly, we talked directly, we share our views in
an unvarnished way and we will continue to do that.”</p>
<p>“But sitting here in public, I will just say that the United States
is going to make its principles and propositions absolutely clear,
including the sanctity of innocent human life. And then we will continue
to provide our advice to Israel in private.”</p>

<h2 id="judge-reinstates-gag-order-in-trump-federal-election-case">Judge
Reinstates Gag Order in Trump Federal Election Case</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A federal judge on Sunday reinstated a gag order she imposed on
Donald Trump in the Washington case accusing him of trying to overturn
his 2020 election defeat, denying his bid for a stay pending appeal.</p>
<p>The order prohibited Trump from targeting the special counsel
prosecuting his case or witnesses who might be called to testify about
his efforts to upend his election loss.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan imposed the gag order at the
Justice Department’s request. She temporarily lifted it on Oct. 20 after
Trump’s lawyers appealed. And she reversed that decision on Sunday
evening, according to the court’s docket.</p>
<p>A copy of the judge’s order reinstating the gag was not immediately
available.</p>
<p>Trump in the past has called Special Counsel Jack Smith a “deranged
lunatic” and a “thug,” among other insults. Trump is facing four
criminal cases and has made disparaging comments about prosecutors in
each of them, as well as against the New York state attorney general who
brought civil fraud charges against him.</p>
<p>Trump has pleaded not guilty to charges that he plotted to interfere
unlawfully in the counting of votes and block the congressional
certification of his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden.</p>

id="im-totally-blind.-artificial-intelligence-is-helping-me-rediscover-the-world.">I’m
totally blind. Artificial intelligence is helping me rediscover the
world.</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>When I first heard about Be My AI—a new collaboration between Open AI
and Be My Eyes, an app that connects sighted volunteers with blind
people who need help via video call—I didn’t let myself get too excited.
Be My AI promised to allow blind people to receive an A.I.–generated
description of any photo we uploaded. This was a tantalizing prospect,
but it wasn’t the first time a tech company had promised to
revolutionize the way people with disabilities access visual content.
Microsoft had already given us Seeing AI, which in a very rudimentary
way provided a rough idea of what was going on in the images we shared,
and which allowed us—again, in a fairly basic way—to interact with
information contained in written texts. But the details were missing,
and in most cases we could know only that there was a person in the
picture and what they were doing, nothing more. Be My AI was different.
Suddenly, I was in a world where nothing was off limits. By simply
waving my cellphone, I could hear, with great detail, what my friends
were wearing, read street signs and shop prices, analyze a room without
having entered it, and indulge in detailed descriptions of the food—one
of my great passions—that I was about to eat. I like to make fun of “AI”
– those quotes are there for a reason – but that doesn’t mean it can’t
be truly useful. This is a great example of this technology providing a
tangible, real, and possibly life-altering benefit to someone with a
disability, and that’s just amazing. My only gripe is that, as the
author notes, the images have to be uploaded to the service in order to
be analysed. Cynical as I tend to be, this was probably the intent of
OpenAI’s executives. A ton of blind people and other people with vision
issues will be uploading a lot of private data to be sucked up into the
Open AI database, for further “AI” training. But that’s easy for me to
say, and I think blind people and other people with vision issues will
argue that’s a sacrifice they’re totally comfortable making, considering
that they’re getting in return.</p>

<p>date: 2023-10-30, from: Marginallia log</p>
<p>So a bit of an update on what I’ve been working on. This will be
adapted into release notes in a while, but I haven’t quite wrapped a bow
on the change set yet. Still, it has certainly been a few weeks. Didn’t
quite land how busy I’ve been until I set down to draft this post.
Them’s some changes, and I’m skipping a few to keep this meandering post
at a sane length.</p>
