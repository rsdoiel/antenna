In this

<p>date: 2024-08-20, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
When President Biden took the stage last night at the DNC, I had a
moment of buyer‚Äôs remorse. He looked so good in his black suit, and the
pictures of the new candidates, and their spouses, looked comical in
comparison to the <i>president</i> who was about to speak.
</p>
<p>
Why did Walz have a permanent frown on his face. I find his presence
next to Harris is almost always awkward. He‚Äôs taller, and moves a lot. I
noticed this with Sanders when he was debating Clinton. She stood still
and Sanders waved his hands a lot. She spoke quietly, he shouted.
</p>
<p>
Biden shouted last night, and he was mostly unplugged. On the team, but
you have to wonder, how did the journos get so much power that they
could force this change. He gave a fine speech. I‚Äôm not sure that
pushing him aside, net-net, was a win for us. Maybe Harris will be a
sugar high.
</p>
<p>
One thing I know for sure, the new Democratic Party must not make the
mistake that Biden did, must not subjugate itself to the press. When
they go on the attack, you must respond. Break their wall of
objectivity, these people are political players, and so far not subject
to rebuttal. That must end. If they want to be in the middle, then don‚Äôt
pretend they aren‚Äôt.
</p>
<p>
They will yell about the First Amendment, which also applies to elected
leaders and candidates for office, and there is no special right for
publications like the NYT, they have no immunity to First Amendment
speech about them.
</p>
<p>
To the extent we can, it‚Äôs time to push them aside.
</p>
<p>
When someone quotes the NYT in frustration, I have a mantra I repeat
over and over, ‚ÄúIgnore the NY Times.‚Äù I‚Äôm going to paste it in 25 times
now so you get the idea. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times.
Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore
the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY
Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times.

to websites: let us train our AI on your content, or we‚Äôll remove you
from Google Search</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Google now displays convenient artificial intelligence-based answers
at the top of its search pages ‚Äî¬†meaning users may never click through
to the websites whose data is being used to power those results. But
many site owners say they can‚Äôt afford to block Google‚Äôs AI from
summarizing their content. That‚Äôs because the Google tool that sifts
through web content to come up with its AI answers is the same one that
keeps track of web pages for search results, according to publishers.
Blocking Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google the way sites have blocked some of its
AI competitors would also hamper a site‚Äôs ability to be discovered
online. ‚Ü´ Julia Love and Davey Alba OSNews still relies partially on
advertising right now, and thus Google continues to play a role in our
survival. You can help by reducing our dependency on Google by
supporting us through Patreon, making donations using Ko-Fi, or buying
our merch. The more of you support us, the closer to reality the dream
of an ad-free OSNews not dependent on Google becomes. OSNews is my sole
source of income, and if that does not work out, OSNews will cease to
exist if I‚Äôm forced to find another job. Due to Google‚Äôs utter dominance
on the internet, websites and publishers have no choice but to accept
whatever Google decides to do. Not being indexed by the most popular
search engine on the web with like 90% market share is a death sentence,
but feeding Google‚Äôs machine learning algorithms will be a slow death by
a thousands cuts, too, for many publishers. The more content is fed to
Google‚Äôs AI tools, the better they‚Äôll get at simply copying your style
to a T, and the better they‚Äôll get at showing just the little paragraph
or line that matters as a Google result, meaning you won‚Äôt have to visit
the site in question. It‚Äôs also not great for Google in the long-term,
either. Google Search relies on humans making content for people to
find; if there‚Äôs no more quality content for people to find, people
aren‚Äôt going to be using Google as much anymore. In what is typical of
the search giant, it seems they‚Äôre not really looking ahead very far
into the future, chasing short-term profits riding the AI hype train,
while long-term profits take a back seat. Maybe I‚Äôm just too stupid to
understand the Silicon Valley galaxy brain business boys, but to a
simple man like me it seems rather stupid to starve the very websites,
publishers, authors, and so on that your main product relies on to be
useful in the first place. I honestly don‚Äôt even know how much of
OSNews‚Äô traffic comes from Google, so I don‚Äôt know how much it would
even affect us were we to tell Google‚Äôs crawlers to get bent. My guess
is that search traffic is still a sizable portion of our traffic, so I‚Äôm
definitely not going to gamble the future of OSNews. Luckily we‚Äôre quite
small and I doubt many people are interested in AI generating my writing
style and the topics I cover anyway, so I don‚Äôt think I have to worry as
much as some of the larger tech websites do.</p>

<p>
While the Democratic National Convention got underway in Chicago

her of waging ‚Äúwar on American energy‚Äù and promised to ‚Äúunlock American

power plant pollution, saying Harris is on ‚Äúa regulatory jihad to shut

Allies have encouraged Harris to lean into the environmental wins of the

may use Jackson Hole speech to hint at how fast and how far the Fed
could cut rates</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington ‚Äî¬†Federal Reserve officials have said they‚Äôre increasingly
confident that they‚Äôve nearly tamed inflation. Now, it‚Äôs the health of
the job market that‚Äôs starting to draw their concern.</p>
<p>With inflation cooling toward its 2% target, the pace of hiring
slowing and the unemployment rate edging up, the Fed is poised to cut
its benchmark interest rate next month from its 23-year high. How fast
it may cut rates after that, though, will be determined mainly by
whether employers keep hiring. A lower Fed benchmark rate would
eventually lead to lower rates for auto loans, mortgages and other forms
of consumer borrowing.</p>
<p>Chair Jerome Powell will likely provide some hints about how the Fed
sees the economy and what its next steps may be in a high-profile speech
Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, at the Fed‚Äôs annual conference of
central bankers. It‚Äôs a platform that Powell and his predecessors have
often used to signal changes in their thinking or approach.</p>
<p>Powell will likely indicate that the Fed has grown more confident
that inflation is headed back to the 2% target, which it has long said
would be necessary before rate cuts would begin.</p>
<p>Economists generally agree that the Fed is getting closer to
conquering high inflation, which brought financial pain to millions of
households beginning three years ago as the economy rebounded from the
pandemic recession. Few economists, though, think Powell or any other
Fed official is prepared to declare ‚Äúmission accomplished.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that the Fed has to fear inflation,‚Äù said Tom
Porcelli, U.S. chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income. ‚ÄúAt this point,
it‚Äôs right that the Fed is now more focused on labor versus inflation.
Their policy is calibrated for inflation that is much higher than
this.‚Äù</p>
<p>Still, how fast the Fed cuts rates in the coming months will depend
on what the economic data shows. After the government reported this
month that hiring in July was much less than expected and that the
jobless rate reached 4.3%, the highest in three years, stock prices
plunged for two days on fears that the U.S. might fall into a recession.
Some economists began speculating about a half-point Fed rate cut in
September and perhaps another identical cut in November.</p>
<p>But healthier economic reports last week, including another decline
in inflation and a robust gain in retail sales, have largely dispelled
those concerns. Wall Street traders now expect three quarter-point Fed
cuts in September, November and December, though in December it‚Äôs nearly
a coin-toss between a quarter- and a half-point cut. Mortgage rates have
already started to decline in anticipation of a rate reduction.</p>
<p>A half-point Fed rate cut in September would become more likely if
there were signs of a further slowdown in hiring, some officials have
said. The next jobs report will be issued on Sept.¬†6, after the Jackson
Hole conference but before the Fed‚Äôs next meeting in mid-September.</p>
<p>Raphael Bostic, president of the Fed‚Äôs Atlanta branch, said in an
interview Monday with The Associated Press that ‚Äúevidence of
accelerating weakness in labor markets may warrant a more rapid move,
either in terms of the increments of movement or the speed at which we
try to get back‚Äù to a level of rates that no longer restricts the
economy.</p>
<p>Even if hiring stays solid, the Fed is set to cut rates this year
given the steady progress that‚Äôs been made on inflation, economists say.
Last week, the government said consumer prices rose just 2.9% in July
from a year ago, the smallest such increase in more than three
years.</p>
<p>Bostic noted that the economy has changed from just a couple of
months ago, when he was suggesting that a rate cut might not be
necessary until the final three months of the year.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve got more confidence that we are likely to get to our target for
inflation,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôve seen labor markets weaken considerably
relative to where they were‚Äù last year. ‚ÄúWe might need to shift our
policy stance sooner than I would have thought before.‚Äù</p>
<p>Both Bostic and Austan Goolsbee, president of the Fed‚Äôs Chicago
branch, say that with inflation falling, inflation-adjusted interest
rates ‚Äî which are what many businesses and investors pay most attention
to ‚Äî are rising even as inflation has slowed. When the Fed first set its
key rate at its current 5.3%, inflation ‚Äî excluding volatile energy and
food costs ‚Äî was 4.7%. Now, it‚Äôs just 3.2%.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur policies are getting tighter with every moment in that type of
situation,‚Äù Bostic said. ‚ÄúWe have to be concerned‚Äù that rates are so
high they could cause an economic slowdown.</p>
<p>Still, Bostic said that for now, the job market and the economy
appear mostly healthy, and he still expects a ‚Äúsoft landing,‚Äù whereby
inflation falls back to the Fed‚Äôs 2% target without a recession
occurring.</p>
<p>With the economy‚Äôs outlook unclear and the Fed focusing heavily on
what future data shows, there may be only so much Powell will be able to
say Friday about the central bank‚Äôs next steps.</p>
<p>Given the Fed‚Äôs focus on how the economic data comes in, ‚Äúit will be
difficult for Powell to pre-commit to a particular trajectory at Jackson
Hole,‚Äù Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, said in
a research note.</p>

2024-08-19 Something new: intrigue
</h1>
<p>
A while ago,
<a class="account" href="https://ttrpg-hangout.social/@enfors" title="@enfors@ttrpg-hangout.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="enfors">@enfors</span></a> said he wanted
his sandbox generator supplement to have something special. I wasn‚Äôt
exactly sure what he was thinking of, but I started thinking about the
things that I feel are under-explored.
</p>
<p>
A while ago, for example, I wondered: What would be the simplest game
that emphasises how many friends you make, that rewards the size of the
community you build? Back in 2016 I wrote a game called
<a href="2016-08-19_Romantic_Fantasy">Best Friends</a> that I never
used. It was <a href="2019-10-10_Non-adventure_games%3F">still an
adventure game</a>. Basically, replace your ‚Äúlevel‚Äù with the number of
friends you have. Something like that.
</p>
<p>
But that still doesn‚Äôt get into really new territory. Something I would
like to see is a system for how to run an intrigue as a party ‚Äì
including everybody at the table, for all the classes and skill
profiles. I feel that <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> attempted to do
this but the result wasn‚Äôt great, at least at my table.
</p>
<p>
Quoting my past self:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I‚Äôm also not too happy with A Song of Ice and Fire. We‚Äôve only played
three times, so I‚Äôm willing to give it more time. When I ran one of the
sessions I basically split the party to the max since since all
characters are so diverse. There is no D&amp;D like party and that also
requires me to rethink my adventure design. ‚Äì

and a die was maybe cast, ‚Äúas we wait for that, we cut to‚Ä¶‚Äù and soon
enough ‚Äúin the mean time‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äì and I do this aggressively, in small time
slots. This results in a somewhat military style of pointing at people
to let them know that now is their turn, while simultaneously waving at
others to hold their thoughts, or maybe cutting talkative players off
when they‚Äôre running too long. It‚Äôs weird, but when there‚Äôs a lot of
players, or when there‚Äôs no party play to return to, it works well
enough. We‚Äôve made these kinds of mistakes in games where there are
characters that are well suited for fighting and others that are not,
with their players trying to solve problems by fighting, and players do
not. This happened to me when I ran a one-shot of <em>A Song of Ice and
Fire</em>. It worked for a session, but it was exhausting and I don‚Äôt
want to claim that it‚Äôs a good solution. It was simply a short term
solution that worked, for me. Next time, however, make sure players
create characters that will adventure together. ‚Äì

<p>
Perhaps the split into combat and intrigue that the game introduced
wasn‚Äôt good game design because it made sense from the perspective of
emulating the books but it didn‚Äôt make sense from the perspective of
some people wanting to play a game together. Or maybe it just didn‚Äôt fit
my expectations of what it means to play together. Or maybe we just
missed the implied recommendation to focus on either combat or intrigue
and everybody having two characters, one for each domain. Or maybe just
run either a combat campaign or an intrigue campaign.
</p>
<p>
So what I‚Äôm looking for is a way to get intrigue results, using
procedures like we do for combat or exploration, for dungeons or the
wilderness. The goal is to bring about a change in leadership of a town,
a gang, a castle, an army unit, or to succeed in an act of sabotage, to
incite a rebellion ‚Äì things that are either hand-waved or the party is
hired for the dirty work while the non-player characters are the
politicians and rabble-rousers. I know this can work. It‚Äôs OK for the
party to do the dirty work, to assassinate a tyrant and the non-player
characters then taking the throne and similar things, but I want to go
further. I want to involve all the players at the table. I want the
players to think about the logistics of war, the organising and
preparations of revolutions, the intricacies of marriage politics.
</p>
<p>
What if B/X D&amp;D went levels 1‚Äì3 is for dungeons, 4‚Äì6 is for the
wilderness and 7‚Äì9 is <em>for politics</em>. Doesn‚Äôt that sound
fantastic? What sort of rules would you find in that third book? You
would not get to name level by being a colonizer and clearing the land
but by taking over an existing position of power ‚Äì through intrigue.
Oust the abbot, kick out the bishop, marry into the baron‚Äôs family, take
over the guild. With the help of your friends. Without resorting to
combat, but with dice rolling.
</p>
<p>
The dice rolling and the procedures are important to me because
otherwise it all goes in a direction I don‚Äôt like:
<a href="2014-08-21_No_Dice">the referee decides everything and that is
exhausting</a>.
</p>
<p>
Not something like Burning Wheel‚Äôs Duel of Wits but something like
social combat for Fate games, like the <a href="social-combat">social
combat system in Diaspora</a>, for example. Note
<a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@bradjmurray" title="@bradjmurray@dice.camp"><span
class="citation" data-cites="bradjmurray">@bradjmurray</span></a>‚Äôs most
recent take on those rules:

This space deserves more attention.

<p>
<strong>2024-08-20</strong>. I find that urban adventures suffer from
the same problem. If it‚Äôs just two or three buildings and those act like
dungeons, my games work. If it‚Äôs just social encounters that can be
resolved with reaction rolls, my games work. But everything else in an
urban environment seems to be politics, to me. And I have no good
procedures to resolve those. So if anybody reading this is thinking
about writing a blog post on the topic, I‚Äôd love to read it.

<h2 id="final-report-on-lewiston-mass-shooting-to-be-released">Final
report on Lewiston mass shooting to be released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LEWISTON, Maine ‚Äî¬†After more than a dozen public meetings, scores of
witnesses and thousands of pages of evidence, a special commission
created to investigate the deadliest shooting in Maine history is ready
to issue its final report on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The independent commission began its work a month after the Oct.¬†25
mass shooting by an Army reservist that killed 18 people at a bowling
alley and a bar and grill in Lewiston. Over nine months, there has been
emotional testimony from family members and survivors of the shooting,
law enforcement officials and U.S. Army Reserves personnel, and
others.</p>
<p>The commission created by Gov.¬†Janet Mills will hold a news
conference to release the full report at Lewiston City Hall ‚Äî less than
5 kilometers from the two sites where the shootings took place.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs unclear if the report will contain any surprises. An interim
report released in March said law enforcement should have seized the
shooter‚Äôs guns and put him in protective custody weeks before the
shootings.</p>
<p>The commission‚Äôs public hearings revealed the swift response by
police to the shootings, but also the ensuing chaos during the massive
search for the gunman. Also revealed were missed opportunities to stop
the shooter, 40-year-old Robert Card, an Army Reservist whose mental
health was spiraling.</p>
<p>Card‚Äôs sister testified at a hearing, her hand resting on his
military helmet as she spoke.</p>
<p>Kathleen Walker, whose husband Jason was killed while rushing at Card
to try to stop him, also testified, and said: ‚ÄúThe system failed, and we
can‚Äôt allow this to happen again.‚Äù</p>
<p>Family members and fellow reservists said Card had exhibited
delusional and paranoid behavior months before the shootings. He was
hospitalized by the Army during training in July 2023, but a commanding
officer acknowledged not checking to ensure compliance on follow-up
care.</p>
<p>The starkest warning came in September when a fellow reservist texted
an Army supervisor, saying, ‚ÄúI believe he‚Äôs going to snap and do a mass
shooting.‚Äù Card was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after a
search that followed the shootings.</p>
<p>Army officials conducted their own investigation after the shootings
that Lt. Gen.¬†Jody Daniels, then the chief of the Army Reserves, said
found ‚Äúa series of failures by unit leadership.‚Äù Three Army Reserve
officers were disciplined for dereliction of duty, according to the
report, which noted communication failures within the chain of command
and between military and civilian hospitals.</p>
<p>Maine‚Äôs legislature passed new guns laws for the state, which has a
tradition of firearms ownership, in the wake of the shootings. A
three-day waiting period for gun purchases went into effect earlier this
month.</p>
<p>The Lewiston commission is chaired by Daniel Wathen, a former chief
justice of Maine‚Äôs highest court. The seven-member commission also
included two former federal prosecutors, two additional former judges, a
psychiatrist and executive at a psychiatric hospital, and the state‚Äôs
former chief forensic psychologist.</p>

significantly tame California‚Äôs fourth-largest wildfire on record</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHICO, Calif. ‚Äî¬†California‚Äôs largest wildfire this year has been
significantly tamed as the state‚Äôs initially fierce fire season has, at
least temporarily, fallen into a relative calm.</p>
<p>The Park Fire was 53% contained Monday after scorching nearly 1,738
square kilometers in several northern counties, destroying 637
structures and damaging 49 as it became the state‚Äôs fourth-largest
wildfire on record.</p>
<p>A large portion of the fire area has been in mop-up stages, which
involves extinguishing smoldering material along containment lines, and
residents of evacuated areas are returning home. Timber in its northeast
corner continues to burn.</p>
<p>The fire is burning islands of vegetation within containment lines,
the Cal Fire situation summary said.</p>
<p>The Park Fire was allegedly started by arson on July 24 in a
wilderness park outside the Central Valley city of Chico. It spread
northward with astonishing speed in withering conditions as it climbed
the western slope of the Sierra Nevada.</p>
<p>July was marked by extraordinary heat in most of California, where
back-to-back wet winters left the state flush with grasses and
vegetation that dried and became ready to burn. Wildfires erupted up and
down the state.</p>
<p>The first half of August has been warmer than average but not
record-breaking, according to Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the
University of California, Los Angeles.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still seeing pretty regular ignitions and we‚Äôre still seeing
significant fire activity, but the pace has slowed and the degree of
that activity, the intensity, rates of initial spread, are not as high
as they were,‚Äù he said in an online briefing Friday.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNonetheless, vegetation remains drier than average in most places in
California and will likely remain so nearly everywhere in California for
the foreseeable future,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>There are signs of a return of high heat in parts of the West by late
August and early September, Swain said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI would expect to see another resurgence in wildfire activity then
across a broad swath of the West, including California,‚Äù he said.</p>

id="biden-gets-rousing-ovation-gives-harris-enthusiastic-endorsement">Biden
gets rousing ovation, gives Harris enthusiastic endorsement</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Chicago ‚Äî¬†President Joe Biden delivered his valedictory address to
the Democratic National Convention on Monday night, as his decision to
end his reelection bid released newfound energy within his party with
Vice President Kamala Harris‚Äô elevation to the top of the ticket.</p>
<p>After 52 years rising to the pinnacle of influence within his party,
Biden, 81, received a hero‚Äôs welcome for the act of stepping aside for
Harris, weeks after many in his party were pressuring him to drop his
bid for reelection. One month after an unprecedented mid-campaign
switch, the opening night of the convention in Chicago was designed to
give a graceful exit to the incumbent president and slingshot Harris
toward a faceoff with Republican Donald Trump, whose comeback bid for
the White House is viewed by Democrats as an existential threat.</p>
<p>A visibly emotional Biden was greeted by a more than four-minute-long
ovation and chants of ‚ÄúThank you, Joe.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAmerica, I love you,‚Äù he replied.</p>
<p>Speaking clearly and energetically, Biden appeared to relish the
chance to defend his record, advocate for his vice president and go on
the attack against Trump. His delivery was more reminiscent of the Biden
who won in 2020 than the mumbling and sometimes incoherent one-time
candidate whose debate performance against Trump in June sparked the
downfall of his reelection campaign.</p>
<p>Biden, in his remarks, repeated his 2020 theme that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre in a
battle for the very soul of America,‚Äù and pressed the case for why
Harris and her running mate Tim Walz were best prepared to wage it.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBecause of you, we‚Äôve had the most extraordinary four years of
progress ever, period,‚Äù Biden declared. And then he interjected, ‚ÄúI say
‚Äòwe,‚Äô I mean me and Kamala,‚Äô‚Äù sharing the credit for his most popular
successes with the vice president to whom he handed over his political
operation.</p>
<p>Harris made an unannounced appearance onstage as the convention‚Äôs
prime-time program began Monday evening to thank Biden for his
leadership and watched his remarks from the stands.</p>
<p>‚ÄúJoe, thank you for your historic leadership, for your lifetime of
service to our nation, and for all you‚Äôll continue to do,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe
are forever grateful to you.‚Äù</p>
<p>Biden‚Äôs speech, billed as the marquee event of the evening, was
pushed into late night as the convention program lagged more than an
hour behind schedule.</p>
<p>The president recalled the 2017 ‚Äúunite the right‚Äù rally, when
torch-carrying white supremacists marched in Charlottesville, Virginia,
an episode he cites as cementing his decision to run for president in
2020 despite his ongoing grief over the death of his son Beau Biden.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI could not stay on the sidelines,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúSo I ran. I had no
intention of running again. I‚Äôd just lost part of my soul. But I ran
with a deep conviction.‚Äù</p>
<p>Biden celebrated the successes from his administration, including a
massive boost in infrastructure spending and a cap on the price of
insulin. The spending resulted in more money going to Republican-leaning
states than Democratic states, he said, because ‚Äúthe job of the
president is to deliver for all of America.‚Äù</p>
<p>During one of the crowd‚Äôs many chants of ‚Äúthank you, Joe,‚Äù he added,
‚ÄúThank you, Kamala, too.‚Äù</p>
<p>Not even a month ago, Democrats were riven over foreign policy,
political strategy and Biden himself, who was holding on after a
disastrous debate by claiming he had a better chance than any other
Democrat ‚Äî including Harris ‚Äî of beating Trump.</p>
<p>On Monday, Biden insisted he did not harbor any ill will to the many
voices in the arena before him who had pushed him to the exits and
called on the party to unite around Harris. Accusing Trump of ‚Äúbowing
down‚Äù to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Biden said, ‚ÄúI never have and
I promise you Kamala Harris will never do it.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe‚Äôll be a president we can all be proud of,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>First lady Jill Biden alluded to her husband‚Äôs wrenching decision to
leave the race in her remarks minutes before Biden took the stage. She
said she fell in love with him all over again ‚Äújust weeks ago, when I
saw him dig deep into his soul and decide to no longer seek reelection
and endorse Kamala Harris.‚Äù</p>
<p>Still, there was little question that the Democratic Party would
almost certainly have been in a far worse state if Biden had continued
to cling to his campaign, despite growing concerns about his mental and
physical acuity after struggling to complete sentences during his debate
against Trump.</p>
<p>Democrats took turns praising Biden‚Äôs leadership and his choice in
Harris to succeed him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never known a more compassionate man than
Joe Biden,‚Äù said his longtime confidant Delaware Sen.¬†Chris Coons, who
led the crowd in a ‚Äúwe love Joe‚Äù chant.</p>
<p>They tried to connect both Biden and Harris to what the party sees as
the governing pair‚Äôs most popular accomplishments: leading the country
out of the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, pushing for massive
investments in the country‚Äôs infrastructure, working to lower health
care costs and promoting clean energy.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThanks to Joe and Kamala, we reduced the price of prescription
drugs, repaired roads and bridges and replaced lead pipes,‚Äù said South
Carolina Representative Jim Clyburn, whose 2020 endorsement was critical
to Biden winning that primary. He added that one of Biden‚Äôs best
decisions was ‚Äúselecting Kamala Harris as his vice president and
endorsing her to succeed him.‚Äù</p>
<p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was greeted with
prolonged applause, saluted Harris while noting her potential to break
the ‚Äúhighest, hardest glass ceiling‚Äù to become America‚Äôs first female
president. Clinton was the Democratic nominee in 2016, but she lost that
election to Trump.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTogether, we‚Äôve put a lot of cracks in the highest, hardest glass
ceiling,‚Äù Clinton said, invoking a metaphor she referenced in her
concession speech eight years ago. ‚ÄúOn the other side of that glass
ceiling is Kamala Harris taking the oath of office as our 47th president
of the United States. When a barrier falls for one of us, it clears the
way for all of us.‚Äù</p>
<p>Clinton also saluted Biden for stepping aside, saying, ‚ÄúNow we are
writing a new chapter in America‚Äôs story.‚Äù</p>
<p>Highlighting the party‚Äôs generational reach, Clinton, 76, followed
New York Rep.¬†Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 34, who endorsed Harris while
delivering the first mention of the war in Gaza from the convention
stage, addressing an issue that has split the party‚Äôs base ever since
Hamas‚Äô Oct.¬†7 attack and Israel‚Äôs resulting offensive.</p>
<p>Outside the arena, thousands of protesters descended on Chicago to
decry the Biden-Harris administration‚Äôs support for the Israeli war
effort.</p>
<p>Harris ‚Äúis working tirelessly to secure a cease-fire in Gaza and
bringing the hostages home,‚Äù Ocasio-Cortez said, drawing cheers from the
crowd.</p>
<p>Biden acknowledged the protests outside the convention and inside the
arena as he spoke, saying, ‚ÄúThose protesters out in the street have a
point. A lot of innocent people are being killed on both sides.‚Äù He
reiterated his push to get Israel and Hamas to agree to a cease-fire
deal that would also see the release of hostages taken by Hamas on
Oct.¬†7 in the attack that sparked the 10-month war.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Democrats also looked to keep the focus on Trump, whose
criminal convictions they mocked and who they asserted was only fighting
for himself, rather than ‚Äúfor the people‚Äù ‚Äî the night‚Äôs official
theme.</p>
<p>Michigan state Sen.¬†Mallory McMorrow hoisted an oversized copy of
‚ÄúProject 2025‚Äù ‚Äî a blueprint for a second Trump term that was put
together by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank ‚Äî onto
the lectern and quoted from portions of it.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo we read it,‚Äù McMorrow said. ‚ÄúWhatever you think it might be. It
is so much worse.‚Äù</p>
<p>Trump, the former president, has publicly disavowed any interests in
the policies outlined in Project 2025, but he has close ties to its
authors and campaign aides had praised its work in the past.</p>
<p>Democrats kept abortion access front and center for voters, betting
that the issue will propel them to success as it has in other key races
since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago. Speakers
Monday included three women whose health care suffered as a result of
that decision. And the convention program included a video of Trump
praising his own role in getting Roe struck down.</p>

Day 1: Biden‚Äôs exit, talk of the glass ceiling, nod to Gaza
protesters</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHICAGO ‚Äî¬†The Democratic National Convention ‚Äôs first night showcased
speeches from the last Democrat to lose to Donald Trump and the last one
to beat him.</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton spoke hopefully of finally breaking the ‚Äúglass
ceiling‚Äù to elect a female president. Joe Biden laced into Trump and
directly acknowledged the concerns of protesters against the war in Gaza
who demonstrated a few blocks from the convention hall.</p>
<p>Here are some takeaways from the first night of the convention.</p>
<p>Biden begins long political exit</p>
<p>President Joe Biden wrapped up the convention‚Äôs opening night by
beginning his long political farewell with an address that both framed
his own legacy and signaled he was ready to start ceding control of the
party to Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>He took the stage to a long, raucous ovation from delegates hoisting
‚ÄúWe love Joe‚Äù placards and told them in turn, ‚ÄúI love you!‚Äù After the
affectionate opening, Biden spent long stretches of his 50-minute speech
lacing into Trump, returning to a key theme of the reelection campaign
he‚Äôs no longer running.</p>
<p>Biden ticked through many of his administration‚Äôs achievements,
including a major public works package and climate program, and shared
the credit with Harris. But the convention ran so late that Biden took
the stage after prime time had ended in much of the country. That didn‚Äôt
stop Biden from declaring, ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs winning.‚Äù</p>
<p>Biden called Harris a ‚Äúclose friend‚Äù and said picking her as his
running mate was the best decision he ever made. He also vowed to help
get the new Democratic ticket elected, promising to be the ‚Äúbest
volunteer‚Äù that Harris and Walz have ever seen.</p>
<p>He ended by telling those still listening, ‚ÄúI gave my best to you for
50 years.‚Äù</p>
<p>He had no plan to linger at the convention, though. Biden was set to
fly to California‚Äôs wine country for a vacation immediately after his
speech.</p>
<p>A surprise Harris appearance to pay tribute to Biden</p>
<p>The vice president made an unscheduled appearance onstage to pay
tribute to Biden ahead of his own address to the convention. She told
the president, ‚ÄúThank you for your historic leadership, for your
lifetime of service to our nation, and for all you‚Äôll continue to
do.‚Äù</p>
<p>On a night meant to honor the president who stepped aside to make way
for Harris, the vice president added, ‚ÄúWe are forever grateful to you.‚Äù
Her running mate, Minnesota Gov.¬†Tim Walz, and her husband, Doug Emhoff,
were in the stands to cheer her message.</p>
<p>Gaza gets little attention inside DNC hall ‚Äî except from Biden</p>
<p>Thousands of marchers churned through Chicago‚Äôs streets protesting
U.S. support for Israel during the war in Gaza. But inside the
convention hall, the combustible issue went largely unmentioned until
Biden got to the microphone.</p>
<p>Rep.¬†Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez got cheers when she praised Harris for
working ‚Äútirelessly to get a cease-fire in Gaza and get the hostages
home.‚Äù Sen.¬†Raphael Warnock of Georgia made a brief allusion to the
conflict.</p>
<p>A handful of delegates who ran on an ‚Äúuncommitted‚Äù ticket protesting
Biden‚Äôs position on the war unfurled a banner during his speech that
read ‚ÄúStop Arming Israel.‚Äù But it was blocked by supporters waving Biden
signs before it was wrestled away and the lights over that section of
the audience were shut off.</p>
<p>Biden himself addressed the issue head-on, saying he‚Äôd keep working
to ‚Äúend the war in Gaza and bring peace and security to the Middle
East.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThose protesters out in the streets have a point,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúA
lot of innocent people are being killed, on both sides.‚Äù</p>
<p>The crowd cheered, and for a moment the war didn‚Äôt seem like it was
dividing the party at all.</p>
<p>Clinton revives talk of breaking that ‚Äòglass ceiling‚Äô</p>
<p>Clinton was greeted with wild and sustained applause that lasted for
more than two minutes before she quieted the crowd. She delivered a
fiery speech hoping that Harris could do what she could not ‚Äì- become
the first woman president by beating Trump.</p>
<p>Clinton evoked her 2016 concession speech by referencing all the
‚Äúcracks in the glass ceiling‚Äù that she and her voters had achieved. And
she painted a vision of Harris ‚Äúon the other side of that glass ceiling‚Äù
taking the oath of office as president.</p>
<p>She closed her speech with a striking desire for someone who‚Äôs stood
at the pinnacle of American politics and power: ‚ÄúI want my grandchildren
and their grandchildren to know I was here at this moment. That we were
here and that we were with Kamala Harris every step of the way.‚Äù</p>
<p>Clinton dipped into traditional political attacks in her speech,
including mocking Trump‚Äôs criminal record. That led to chants of ‚Äúlock
him up‚Äù ‚Äî mirroring the ones that Trump‚Äôs supporters directed at Clinton
in 2016.</p>
<p>Tracing a line from Jesse Jackson to Kamala Harris</p>
<p>An early theme of the evening was celebrating the Rev.¬†Jesse Jackson,
a longtime civil rights leader in Chicago and former presidential
candidate in 1984 and 1988. Many Democrats credit him with blazing a
trail that helped Barack Obama win the White House in 2008 and Kamala
Harris become the first woman of color nominated for the presidency.</p>
<p>Jackson was saluted from the stage by several speakers, including
Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and California Rep.¬†Maxine Waters. There
was a video montage of Jackson‚Äôs career and legacy that played before
the 82-year-old Jackson himself came to the stage in a wheelchair,
thrusting his arms skyward and grinning. Jackson has been diagnosed with
Parkinson‚Äôs disease.</p>
<p>During the 1984 Democratic convention in San Francisco, Jackson gave
a speech declaring that America is ‚Äúlike a quilt: Many patches, many
pieces, many colors, many sizes, all woven and held together by a common
thread.‚Äù The address became known as the ‚ÄúRainbow Coalition‚Äù speech, and
Jackson used momentum from it to seek the Democratic nomination again in
1988.</p>
<p>Harris has called Jackson ‚Äúone of America‚Äôs greatest patriots.‚Äù</p>
<p>Remember COVID? Democrats don‚Äôt want voters ‚Äî or Trump ‚Äî to
forget</p>
<p>Democrats opted to shine the convention spotlight on the harrowing
subject of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>It was a reflection of Democratic frustration at how Trump has
portrayed his tenure in office as a golden age for the country, even
though hundreds of thousands of Americans died of COVID-19 during the
last year of his term.</p>
<p>There are plenty of risks for Democrats in hammering the pandemic.
Even more people died of the virus during Biden‚Äôs presidency than during
Trump‚Äôs, voters have shown an eagerness to move on and some preventative
measures championed by Democrats ‚Äî like school closures and masking ‚Äî
are not popular in retrospect.</p>
<p>Still, the lineup of early speakers focused on Trump‚Äôs performance
during the pandemic. Minnesota Lt. Gov.¬†Peggy Flanagan recalled how her
brother was the second person in Tennessee to die of the disease and how
she couldn‚Äôt visit him or hold a memorial service. Rep.¬†Lauren Underwood
of Illinois, a nurse, said of Trump: ‚ÄúHe took the COVID crisis and
turned it into a catastrophe. We can never ever let him be our president
again.‚Äù</p>
<p>Rep.¬†Robert Garcia, whose mother and stepfather died of the disease
in 2020, recalled Trump‚Äôs missteps and concluded with one of the slogans
of Harris‚Äô young campaign: ‚ÄúWe are not going back.‚Äù</p>
<p>Democrats one-up Republicans on labor</p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs convention last month featured a rare appearance from a union
leader at such a GOP event: Teamsters President Sean O‚ÄôBrien. That‚Äôs
reflective of how Trump‚Äôs populism has cut into Democrats‚Äô advantage
with union households.</p>
<p>In that speech, O‚ÄôBrien did not endorse Trump. But he criticized both
major political parties for not doing enough to help working people.</p>
<p>Democrats didn‚Äôt invite O‚ÄôBrien to their convention, but they
countered with a half-dozen other union leaders onstage Monday. And then
Shawn Fain, head of the United Auto Workers, led a blistering chant of
‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs a scab!‚Äù while wearing a red T-shirt emblazoned with those
words.</p>
<p>Fain noted that Biden visited a UAW picket line last year and, when
autoworkers struck in 2019, Harris, not Trump, walked the picket lines.
‚ÄúDonald Trump is all talk and Kamala Harris walks the walk,‚Äù Fain
said.</p>

id="jury-hears-ex-politician-on-trial-for-murder-amassed-photos-id-records-about-slain-vegas-reporter">Jury
hears ex-politician on trial for murder amassed photos, ID records about
slain Vegas reporter</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Las Vegas ‚Äî¬†Hundreds of photos of a slain investigative journalist‚Äôs
home and neighborhood were found on the cellphone and computer of a
local Democratic politician accused of ‚Äúlying in wait‚Äù and killing the
reporter, who had written several articles critical of the official, a
Nevada jury was told Monday.</p>
<p>Other photos taken from Robert Telles‚Äô devices included an image of a
single gray athletic shoe with a distinctive black pattern and a shot of
Telles‚Äô work computer at the Clark County Public Administrator and
Guardian office with results of internet searches through a
password-protected site that retrieved slain reporter Jeff German‚Äôs
name, home address, vehicle registration and date of birth.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Christopher Hamner noted for jurors that photo was taken
Aug.¬†23, 2022 ‚Äî less than two weeks before German was slashed and
stabbed to death in a side yard of his home.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis image came out of Mr.¬†Telles‚Äô phone?‚Äù Hamner asked Matthew
Hovanec, a Las Vegas digital forensics supervisor who testified Monday
about ‚Äúextracting‚Äù the data from Telles‚Äô devices.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt did,‚Äù Hovanec responded.</p>
<p>Detective Justine Gatus, the primary Las Vegas police homicide
investigator of German‚Äôs death, was the main ‚Äî and final ‚Äî witness
called Monday as prosecutors rested their case after four days of
testimony from more than two dozen witnesses.</p>
<p>Telles has pleaded not guilty to murder and faces the possibility of
life in prison if the jury finds him guilty. Prosecutors are not seeking
the death penalty.</p>
<p>Telles insists he didn‚Äôt kill German and was framed for the crime. He
intends to testify, defense lawyer Robert Draskovich said Monday, and is
expected to take the witness stand to cap his own defense case, possibly
Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Gatus cited Las Vegas Review-Journal articles about Telles and the
county office that German wrote, published in May and June 2022, about a
county office in turmoil.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey weren‚Äôt flattering,‚Äù the detective observed.</p>
<p>Social media posts by Telles at the same time derided German and the
articles as false depictions of his efforts to fight corruption amid a
political and social ‚Äúold guard‚Äù real estate network.</p>
<p>Gatus testified that the gray sneaker with a Nike logo and four black
marks on the sole was ‚Äúidentical‚Äù to one jurors saw earlier in
neighbors‚Äô security camera images of a figure wearing orange who slipped
into a side yard of German‚Äôs home where German was later found dead on
Labor Day weekend 2022.</p>
<p>Neither an orange shirt nor a murder weapon was entered as evidence
in the case. But one of those shoes, cut to pieces and bearing spots of
blood from an unidentified source, was found in plastic shopping bag in
Telles‚Äô home following his arrest.</p>
<p>German‚Äôs killing in September 2022, at age 69, made him the only
reporter killed in the U.S. among 69 news media workers killed worldwide
that year, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. German
spent 44 years covering Las Vegas mobsters and public officials at the
Las Vegas Sun and then at the rival Review-Journal.</p>
<p>About 10 of his family members and friends have attended each day of
Telles‚Äô trial but have not spoken publicly about the killing. They
declined as a group on Monday to comment.</p>
<p>Jurors last week heard from forensic scientists who said Telles‚Äô DNA
was found beneath German‚Äôs fingernails and saw security video of the
suspect driving through German‚Äôs neighborhood.</p>

id="democrats-approve-platform-that-mentions-bidens-second-term-despite-his-making-way-for-harris">Democrats
approve platform that mentions Biden‚Äôs ‚Äòsecond term‚Äô despite his making
way for Harris</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHICAGO ‚Äî¬†Delegates at the Democratic National Convention voted
Monday night to approve their 2024 party platform, which lays out
familiar priorities for the party but wasn‚Äôt updated to reflect that
President Joe Biden is no longer running for reelection.</p>
<p>The largely ceremonial vote at Chicago‚Äôs convention signaled the
party coalescing around a singular vision for the next four years ‚Äî
though a somewhat outdated one, as Vice President Kamala Harris has only
outlined a few of her own specific policy positions since she took over
the Democratic presidential ticket last month. The platform makes
repeated reference to Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúsecond term‚Äù despite the president‚Äôs
decision a month ago to no longer seek one.</p>
<p>The Democratic National Committee said the more than 90-page document
‚Äúmakes a strong statement about the historic work that President Biden
and Vice President Harris have accomplished hand-in-hand and offers a
vision for a progressive agenda that we can build on as a nation and as
a Party as we head into the next four years.‚Äù</p>
<p>Regina Romero, the mayor of Tucson, Arizona, and co-chair of the
convention platform committee, told delegates that the platform was
passed ‚Äúprior to the president passing the torch in an act of love and
patriotism.‚Äù She said that the platform nonetheless included input from
all corners of the party and has a ‚Äúforward-looking vision for our party
that echoes the voice of all.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúVice President Harris is now carrying the torch,‚Äù Romero said.</p>
<p>The platform was approved on the floor by a voice vote.</p>
<p>The convention‚Äôs platform committee voted to approve the platform on
July 16, days before Biden bowed out of the race and endorsed Harris on
July 21. As a result, the document repeatedly refers to Biden‚Äôs second
term and his administration‚Äôs accomplishments. It mentions Harris‚Äô work
as vice president but does not describe her candidacy or go into detail
on her views on key issues.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPresident Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats are running to
finish the job,‚Äù it states, a sentiment that is now out of date.</p>
<p>Republican former President Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign has sought to tie
Harris to Biden, arguing that his policies on the economy and other key
issues are deeply unpopular. In a statement released shortly before the
convention vote, it said, ‚ÄúThere is no daylight between Kamala Harris
and Joe Biden. The proof? The DNC just released Kamala‚Äôs party platform,
and it includes at least (asterisk)nineteen(asterisk) mentions of
‚ÄòBiden‚Äôs second term.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p>Harris has indeed talked generally about supporting the Biden
administration‚Äôs key goals, which are more or less endorsed in the
platform as written. It calls for restoring abortion rights nationwide,
continuing to advance green energy initiatives that can create jobs and
help slow climate change, capping low-income families‚Äô child care costs
and urging Congress to approve a pathway to U.S. citizenship for
‚Äúlong-term‚Äù people in the country illegally.</p>
<p>The platform also says Israel‚Äôs right to defend itself is ‚Äúironclad‚Äù
while endorsing the Biden administration‚Äôs efforts to broker a lasting
cease-fire deal that could suspend the fighting between Israel and Hamas
in Gaza.</p>
<p>Harris laid out a string of new economic proposals last week but
otherwise hasn‚Äôt released a detailed list of her policy positions since
taking over the top of the Democratic ticket. Her campaign aides have
suggested she no longer adheres to some of the more liberal positions
she took during her first run for president in 2020, including endorsing
a ban on hydraulic fracturing.</p>
<p>In any event, candidates are not bound to adhere to their party‚Äôs
platform and often don‚Äôt. What the platforms spell out usually has
little effect on the race and is unlikely to have much impact on
Election Day this cycle.</p>

<p>
‚Äú‚ÄúGenerative AI is ripping the humanity out of things. Built on a
foundation of theft, the technology is steering us toward a barren
future,‚Äù Procreate said on the new AI section of its website. ‚ÄúWe think
machine learning is a compelling technology with a lot of merit, but the
path generative AI is on is wrong for us.‚Äù‚Äú
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is a company that knows its audience: the lack of concern for
artist welfare demonstrated by AI vendors has understandably not made
the technology popular with that community. Adobe got into trouble with
its userbase for adding those generative AI features.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs a great way for Procreate to deepen its relationship with artists
and take advantage of Adobe‚Äôs fall from grace. There‚Äôs also something a
bit deeper here: if work created with generative AI does run into
copyright trouble at the hands of current and future lawsuits, work
created with Procreate will be clean of those issues.

id="us-intelligence-officials-blame-iran-for-hacks-targeting-trump-biden-harris-campaigns">US
intelligence officials blame Iran for hacks targeting Trump,
Biden-Harris campaigns</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington ‚Äî¬†U.S. intelligence officials said Monday that they were
confident that Iran was responsible for the hack of Donald Trump‚Äôs
presidential campaign, casting the cyber intrusion as part of a brazen
and broader effort by Tehran to interfere in American politics and
undermine faith in democratic institutions.</p>
<p>Although the Trump campaign and private-sector cybersecurity
investigators had previously said Iran was behind the hacking attempts,
it was the first time the U.S. government had assigned blame for the
attack.</p>
<p>The joint statement from the FBI and other federal agencies also
indicated that Iran was responsible for attempts to hack Vice President
Kamala Harris‚Äô campaign, saying hackers had ‚Äúsought access to
individuals with direct access to the presidential campaign of both
political parties.‚Äù</p>
<p>The goal of the hacking and other activities, federal officials said,
was not only to sow discord but also to shape the outcome of elections
that Iran perceives to be ‚Äúparticularly consequential in terms of the
impact they could have on its national security interests.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during
this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations
targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting
presidential campaigns,‚Äù said the statement, which in addition to the
FBI was also released by the Office of the Director of National
Intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency.</p>
<p>The statement largely confirms the findings of private companies like
Microsoft, which earlier this month issued a report detailing foreign
agents‚Äô attempts to interfere in this year‚Äôs election, and Google, which
separately said that an Iranian group linked to the country‚Äôs
Revolutionary Guard has tried to infiltrate the personal email accounts
of roughly a dozen people linked to President Joe Biden and Trump since
May.</p>

court rejects US soldier‚Äôs appeal of jail term</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Moscow ‚Äî¬†A Russian court rejected an appeal Monday by a U.S. soldier
who has been jailed for three years and nine months for alleged death
threats and theft.</p>
<p>Gordon Black was sentenced in June by a court in Russia‚Äôs Far Eastern
city of Vladivostok, where he was arrested in May while visiting a
Russian woman he met and dated while serving in South Korea.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old was detained after the woman, named by Russian media
as Alexandra Vashuk, reported him to the police after an argument,
saying he physically attacked her and stole about $110 from her.</p>
<p>Black pleaded ‚Äúpartially guilty‚Äù to theft and not guilty to
threatening to kill Vashuk, saying she had started an argument after
drinking.</p>
<p>Black appealed his sentence and Monday, the Primorye regional court
rejected the appeal, saying in a statement that it decided ‚Äúto leave the
verdict in place‚Äù after examining the case.</p>
<p>The pair met in October 2022 on the dating app Tinder in South Korea
and had dated there, Black said, before Vashuk then invited him to come
to Vladivostok.</p>
<p>Black is one of several American citizens imprisoned in Russia.</p>
<p>Washington has accused Moscow of arresting its citizens on baseless
charges to use them as bargaining chips to secure the release of
Russians convicted abroad.</p>
<p>On August 1, Russia freed U.S. reporter Evan Gershkovich, former U.S.
Marine Paul Whelan and 14 others in its biggest prisoner swap with the
West since the Cold War.</p>

<h2 id="menuetos-gets-basic-x-server">MenuetOS gets basic X server</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>There‚Äôs been a few new releases since the last time we talked about
MenuetOS, back in March of this year when version 1.50.00 was released,
so I figured it was time to take a look at what the project‚Äôs been up
to. And just in case you don‚Äôt remember ‚Äì MenuetOS is 64 bit operating
system written in assembly that fits on a single 1.44 MB floppy disk.
There‚Äôs also a 32 bit version that‚Äôs no longer being developed ‚Äì I
think. Weirdly enough, the 1.50.00 released is no longer listed, but
recent changes include Mplayer being part of the disk image, further
updates to the included X-Window Server, the usual bugfixes, and a few
more things. The X server is quite cool ‚Äì with it, you can run, say,
Firefox on your Linux installation, but have the MenuetOS X server
render the UI. In addition, thanks to MenuetOS now including a basic
POSIX layer, it‚Äôs possible to create basic applications that run
unmodified on both MenuetOS and a Linux distribution like Ubuntu.
Neat.</p>

id="floods-from-thunderstorms-lead-to-dramatic-rescues-and-2-deaths-in-connecticut">Floods
from thunderstorms lead to dramatic rescues and 2 deaths in
Connecticut</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>oxford, connecticut ‚Äî¬†Torrential rains turned streets into raging
rivers in parts of Connecticut and New York‚Äôs Long Island, trapping
people in cars and a restaurant, covering vehicles in mud, and sweeping
two women to their deaths, authorities said.</p>
<p>Dramatic rescues unfolded as a foot (30 centimeters) of rain fell on
some parts of western Connecticut late Sunday and early Monday, coming
down so fast that it caught drivers unaware. Connecticut Governor Ned
Lamont said more than 100 people were evacuated by search and rescue
teams Sunday evening.</p>
<p>The bodies of two women who had been in separate cars were recovered
Monday in Oxford, a town of 13,000 about 35 miles southwest of Hartford,
officials said. Both were Oxford residents.</p>
<p>Firefighters were trying to get the first woman to safety when the
flooded Little River swept her away, Oxford Fire Chief Scott Pelletier
said at a news conference with other Connecticut officials. The second
woman got out of her car and tried to cling to a sign, but ‚Äúthe racing
water was too much‚Äù and swept her away, too, he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is a tragic and devastating day for Oxford,‚Äù the town‚Äôs first
selectman, George Temple, said.</p>
<p>U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal added, ‚ÄúWho would have thought the
Little River would turn into a gushing torrent of destruction, which is
what happened.‚Äù</p>
<p>In nearby Southbury, Lucas Barber used wilderness first responder
techniques he learned as a backpacker and rock climber to wade through
chest-high water to save Patrick Jennings, who has a prosthetic leg, and
Jennings‚Äô dog from a car outside the Southbury Plaza mall.</p>
<p>Barber, 30, said he drove to higher ground and grabbed rope he keeps
in his car for emergencies. Jennings‚Äô car, he said, looked like it was
‚Äúturning in the tide and seemed to be sinking.‚Äù</p>
<p>Barber said he first tried to throw his rope to Jennings but changed
his approach when he was told Jennings had a prosthetic leg. Barber
waded and swam to the car, which was filling with water, he said.</p>
<p>He saw Jennings‚Äô golden retriever, Stanley, in the back, scared, and
Jennings worried about leaving him behind.</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòYour dog is coming with us, but also I need to get you out right
now,‚Äô‚Äù Barber said he told Jennings.</p>
<p>Jennings took off his prosthetic leg, and Barber wrapped his rope
around the man‚Äôs waist and chest. Barber tried tying the rope around the
dog‚Äôs collar, but it came undone. Once he got Jennings to safety and
others could tend to him, he went back for Stanley. Halfway back, Barber
said, the dog got excited to see Jennings and swam the rest of the way
to his owner.</p>
<p>Barber said he went back a third time to fetch Jennings‚Äô prosthetic
leg, which was bobbing next to his car.</p>
<p>In Oxford, rushing waters surrounded the Brookside Inn, trapping 18
people. Firefighters had to stretch a ladder across the floodwaters to
reach them as cars and other large debris carried by the torrent smashed
into the building, said Jeremy Rodorigo, a firefighter from neighboring
Beacon Falls.</p>
<p>The storm system that hit Connecticut and then moved on to Long
Island was separate from Hurricane Ernesto, which on Monday was over the
open Atlantic Ocean but still expected to cause powerful swells,
dangerous surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast.</p>
<p>William Syrett, a professor of meteorology and atmospheric science at
Penn State University, referred to the Connecticut-New York system as
‚Äútraining thunderstorms.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like each thunderstorm is a car on a train track, and so they
just keep going over the same place,‚Äù he said. He cited ‚Äúperfect
conditions‚Äù for the storms, thanks to the amount of moisture in the air
and a slow weather system.</p>
<p>The unusual part was the amount of rain that fell over several hours,
Syrett said, not the thunderstorms themselves.</p>
<p>Ed Romaine, the executive of Long Island‚Äôs Suffolk County, said that
hundreds of homes were affected by flooding and that mudslides covered
the roofs of cars in some areas.</p>
<p>The storms canceled more than 450 flights at Newark Liberty,
LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy airports, officials said.</p>

<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>But last month, that hand-me-down network was dealt a blow when
Happiest Baby, the company that makes Snoo, began charging for access to
some of the bassinet‚Äôs premium features ‚Äî features that used to be
available to Snoo users indefinitely, at no extra cost. Now, access to
the app needed to lock in the bassinet‚Äôs rocking level, to track the
baby‚Äôs sleep and to use the so-called weaning mode, among other
features, will cost parents $20 a month. The change has angered
secondhand users and original buyers alike. On Reddit, the new
subscription model has prompted¬†review bombs,¬†group brainstorms¬†for
collective action and¬†detailed instructions¬†for outraged parents seeking
recourse. Some have taken to filing complaints with the Federal Trade
Commission, Better Business Bureau and state-run consumer protection
offices. ‚Ü´ Sandra E. Garcia and Rachel Sherman at The New York Times My
wife had our first baby a little over three years ago, and our second
one a little over a year ago, and let me tell you ‚Äì the amount of
‚Äúsmart‚Äù and ‚Äúconnected‚Äù stuff they sell targeted at babies and young
parents is insane. The only ‚Äúsmart‚Äù thing we got was a camera that pipes
sound to my phone and detects movement, and sends a notification to our
phone so we can take a peek and see if everything‚Äôs alright. Our oldest
has outgrown it, and our youngest doesn‚Äôt really need it, so it‚Äôs just
being useless at the moment, fitted to the wall. It definitely improved
our nights, though, since it made sure we would never have to get up for
no reason. Other than that, we are very analog. I had heard of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù
bassinets, but we didn‚Äôt think we needed one. That‚Äôs just our decision,
though, and you can rightfully argue that using a camera and open
microphone is not that different. All of these new ‚Äúsmart‚Äù tools are
just that, tools, and can be useful and make your life just a little bit
easier, and there‚Äôs absolutely nothing wrong with that. Being a parent
of a newborn is hard enough as it is without outsiders judging you and
pressuring you into doing things you don‚Äôt think are right, especially
since you know your own newborn ‚Äì and yourself ‚Äì better than some random
outsiders do. The Snoo is one of the more popular smart bassinets,
apparently, and at an entry price of 1700 dollars it‚Äôs bonkers
expensive. The thing is, though, as a new parent you know a lot of the
stuff you buy has a relatively limited shelf life ‚Äì they grow so fast ‚Äì
so you kind of take into account that you‚Äôll be selling some of the more
expensive stuff down the line to recoup some of the costs. We have an
insanely expensive stroller from a Norwegian brand, because it needed to
be able to handle the Arctic climate and its endless snow, including
specialised wheels and tires for trudging through the snow. The resale
value of these is quite decent, so we know we‚Äôll get a decent part of
the initial cost back, especially since we take extremely good care of
it. And this is where the company that makes the Snoo, Happiest Baby,
decided to screw over its customers. The company clearly realised the
theoretical loss of revenue from the used market, and came up with this
subscription model to lock in some of that theoretical revenue. However,
since Happiest Baby always promised all of its features would work
perpetually, this came as a huge shock to both buyers of used Snoo
bassinets, as well as to parents intending to sell their Snoo, who now
see their resale value plummet. The reasoning behind the sudden
subscription model given by the company is absolutely wild. Harvey Karp,
the founder and chief executive of Happiest Baby, defended the move as a
business necessity. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have any dollar from the government, we
don‚Äôt have a dollar from a university,‚Äù said Dr.¬†Karp, a former
pediatrician who created the Snoo after becoming frustrated with the
lack of progress in reducing rates of sudden infant death syndrome, or
SIDS. ‚ÄúWe have to sell products and bring in revenue to be able to get
to this goal.‚Äù That goal, according to Dr.¬†Karp, is ‚Äúthat everyone will
have access to this, and it will be paid for not by your friend, but it
will be paid for by your corporation, the government or your insurance
company,‚Äù the way breast pumps are often covered. He also pointed to
Happiest Baby‚Äôs efforts to make the Snoo available ‚Äúin the inner city
and in rural areas.‚Äù For many parents, however, paying into that ideal
is of little comfort to their bottom line. ‚Ü´ Sandra E. Garcia and Rachel
Sherman at The New York Times He‚Äôs basically stating that because he
doesn‚Äôt get free money from the government, universities, customers‚Äô
employers, or insurance companies, he can‚Äôt make any profit off the Snoo
products. He‚Äôs arguing that a $1700 bassinet with some sensors and chips
is not a profitable product, which sounds absolutely like a flat-out lie
to me. If he really can‚Äôt make a profit with such a price for such a
product, there‚Äôs clearly something else wrong with the way the company
is spending its money. Anyone who has ever watched Last Week Tonight
with Jon Oliver knows just how many healthcare-related markets and
businesses in the United States rely almost exclusively on government
money through programs like Medicare and Medicaid, leading to an insane
amount of scams and wasted money because there aren‚Äôt even remotely
enough inspectors and related personnel to ensure such money is
effectively spent, made worse by the fact such tasks are delegated to
the states. This whole Snoo thing almost make me think Karp intended to
profit off these often nebulous government money streams, but somehow
failed to do so. I feel for the parents, though. They bought a product
that didn‚Äôt include a hint of a subscription or paywalled features, and
now they have</p>

point, we‚Äôll have a much better idea whether the planet is on track to
hit the 1.5 degrees Celsius

threshold</u></a> that some expect it to cross that year; we‚Äôll
<em><em>also</em></em> know whether the United States is likely to meet
the first goal of the Inflation Reduction Act: to reduce national
greenhouse gas emissions to half of 2005 levels
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/climate/#:~:text=As%20part%20of%20that%20vision,pollution%2Dfree%20electricity%20by%202035" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>by
2030</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
There is
<a href="https://x.com/TreyPollardVA/status/1823703292934791328" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
lot riding on the outcome of the 2024 election</u></a>, then. But even
more to the point, there is a lot riding on how, and how aggressively,
Harris extends President Biden‚Äôs climate policies. Last week, I spoke to
nine different climate policy experts about what‚Äôs on their wishlists
for a potential Harris-Walz administration and encountered resounding
excitement about the opportunities ahead. I also encountered nine
different opinions on how, exactly, Harris should capitalize on those
opportunities, should she wind up in the White House come January.
</p>
<p>
That said, the ideas I heard largely coalesced into three main avenues
of approach: The first would see Harris use her position to shore up the
country‚Äôs existing climate policies, doubling down on spending and
addressing loopholes in the IRA. A second path would involve
aggressively expanding on Biden‚Äôs legacy, mainly through major new
investments. The final and most ambitious path would involve Harris
approaching climate change and the energy transition with an original
and bold vision for the years ahead (though your priorities may vary).
</p>
<p>
The policy proposals that fall under these loosely organized paths
aren‚Äôt necessarily mutually exclusive, and, as you‚Äôll see, some of the
advocate‚Äôs proposals fall into multiple categories. But it‚Äôs also true
that by making <em><em>everything </em></em>a priority, nothing is. With
that in mind, here are three approaches climate insiders say Harris
could take if she wins the White House in November.
</p>
<h3>
Harris should finish the job Biden started
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Continue building on what has already been accomplished
</li>
<li>
Ensure permitting reform gets across the line
</li>
<li>
Address existing regulatory uncertainties
</li>
<li>
Make sure policies like the Justice 40 Initiative are working the way
they‚Äôre supposed to
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Before jumping headlong into expanding the country‚Äôs climate policies,
the Harris administration could start by shoring up
<em><em>existing</em></em> legislation ‚Äî mainly, the loopholes and
oversights in the Inflation Reduction Act. ‚ÄúThe IRA was the biggest
climate investment in history and fundamentally changed the emissions
trajectory of the U.S ‚Äî but the work is not done,‚Äù Adrian Deveny,
founder of the decarbonization strategy group
<a href="https://climatevision.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Climate
Vision</u></a> who previously worked on the IRA as Senate Majority
Leader Chuck Schumer‚Äôs director of energy and environmental policy, told
me.
</p>
<p>
As things stand, the policies in the IRA alone
<a href="https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Modeling-the-Inflation-Reduction-Act-with-the-US-Energy-Policy-Simulator_August.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>won‚Äôt
be enough</u></a> to meet President Biden‚Äôs goal of halving the nation‚Äôs
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030; to do that, the U.S. would ‚Äúneed to
pass another IRA-sized bill,‚Äù Deveny said. Until that happens, filling
the IRA‚Äôs emissions gaps will take a lot of work ‚Äúin every sector of the
economy,‚Äù he added.
</p>
<p>
Lena Moffitt, the executive director of
<a href="https://www.evergreenaction.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Evergreen
Action</u></a> ‚Äî which has already released
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/evergreen-action-harris-plan" target="_self"><u>a
comprehensive 2025 climate roadmap</u></a> for a Harris administration ‚Äî
told me that the task of ‚Äúdoubling down on Biden‚Äôs climate legacy as a
job creator‚Äù will run through rebuilding and expanding the grid and
revitalizing industry and rural economies, two projects that started in
the IRA but remain incomplete. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd love to see a day one executive
order from the White House outlining a plan to create American jobs and
seize the mantle of leadership by building clean energy and clean tech
in the United States,‚Äù she told me.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/manchin-barrasso-permitting-bill" target="_self"><u>Permitting
reform</u></a> is part of that ‚Äî and could be another piece of
yet-unfinished business Harris will need to wrap up. ‚ÄúIf that doesn‚Äôt
get done this year, that is what we have to look to as soon as possible
during a future Harris administration,‚Äù Harry Godfrey, who leads
Advanced Energy United‚Äôs Federal Investment and Manufacturing Working
Group, told me.
</p>
<p>
That‚Äôs not the only regulatory matter still up in the air. Austin
Whitman, the CEO of
<a href="https://www.changeclimate.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The
Climate Change Project</u></a>, a non-profit that offers climate
certification labeling and helps businesses reduce their emissions, told
me that the Federal Trade Commission, for example, still hasn‚Äôt updated
its green guides ‚Äî ‚Äúa loose collection of recommendations to companies
on how to behave to not violate the FTC Act‚Äù ‚Äî since 2012. ‚ÄúWe just need
a clear timeline and a sense of direction of where that whole process is
going,‚Äù Whitman told me. Additionally, he said that the government has a
substantial and outstanding role to play in standardizing and
streamlining
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/california-climate-corporate-data-accountability-act-financial-risk" target="_self"><u>emissions
reporting practices</u></a> for businesses ‚Äî which, while perhaps not
‚Äúvery sexy,‚Äù are necessary to ‚Äúrelieve the administrative burden so
companies can focus on decarbonization.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
The last piece: Make sure everything that‚Äôs already in place is actually
working. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing that states and local governments need additional
capacity to manage [the IRA] money well,‚Äù Jillian Blanchard, the
director of
<a href="https://www.lawyersforgoodgovernment.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Lawyers
For Good Government</u></a>‚Äôs climate change program, told me. Harris
could help by enacting ‚Äúmore tangible policies like granting federal
funding to hire community engagement specialists or liaisons or paying
for the time of community leaders to provide local governments with key
information on where the communities are that need to be benefited, and
what they need.‚Äù She also floated the idea of a
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/inflation-reduction-act/community-change-grants-selections" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Community
Change Grant</u></a> extension to help get federal funding to localities
more directly.
</p>
<h3>
Harris should go bigger ‚Äî on everything
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Make investments in high-impact sectors
</li>
<li>
Fund more Climate Pollution Reduction Grants
</li>
<li>
Funnel additional resources into the states
</li>
<li>
Reinstate the U.S. as a global leader on climate
</li>
</ul>
<p>
‚ÄúOne of the criticisms of the Inflation Reduction Act is that it didn‚Äôt
do ‚ÄòX‚Äô ‚Äî whatever ‚ÄòX‚Äô is,‚Äù Costa Samaras, the director of the
<a href="https://www.cmu.edu/energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Wilton
E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation</u></a> at Carnegie Mellon and
a former senior White House energy official, told me. ‚ÄúAnd in reality,
it probably <em><em>did</em></em>. It just didn‚Äôt do it big enough.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
As opposed to those who thought Harris should take a quieter, dare I say
conservative approach to advancing the U.S. climate agenda, Samaras told
me he wanted to see Harris pump up the volume. The current climate
moment requires ‚Äúattacking the places where we need to immediately make
big emissions cuts and big resilience investments. This is the
industrial sector, the cultural sector, heavy transportation, as well as
making sure that our cities and communities are built for people.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
There are plenty of existing programs that could take some supersizing.
Godfrey of Advanced Energy United brought up the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/inflation-reduction-act-solar-panels-heat-pumps?rebelltitem=4#rebelltitem4" target="_self"><u>home
energy rebate programs</u></a>, arguing that as things stand, those
resources are only serving ‚Äúa fraction of the eligible population.‚Äù
Blanchard of Lawyers For Good Government also pointed out that the
Environmental Protection Agency had
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/22/climate/epa-climate-change-money.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>almost
300</u></a> Climate Pollution Reduction Grant applications totaling
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/epa-to-unveil-climate-grant-recipients-next-month/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than $30 billion in requests</u></a> ‚Äî but only $4.3 billion to hand
out. ‚ÄúThere are local governments, state governments, tribal nations,
and territories hungry for this money to implement clean energy
projects,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere are plans that are ready to go if there are
additional federal award dollars in the future.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Another place Harris could expand on Biden‚Äôs legacy would be by
reinstating the U.S. as a climate leader on the world stage. ‚ÄúWe need to
say, ‚Äòclimate is back on the table,‚Äô‚Äù Whitman of The Climate Change
Project told me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a main course, and we‚Äôre going to talk about it‚Äù
‚Äî something that would give us ‚Äúa more credible seat at the negotiating
table at the COPs.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Perhaps most importantly, though, Harris needs to use her term to start
looking toward the future. As Deveny of Climate Vision told me, ‚ÄúWe
designed the IRA to think about meeting our 2030 target. And now we have
to think about 2035.‚Äù Looking ahead isn‚Äôt ‚Äújust about extending
policies,‚Äù in other words, but about anticipating new technologies and
opportunities that could arise in the next decade ‚Äî and Harris, if
elected, should step up to the challenge.
</p>
<h3>
Harris needs a bold, original vision
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Start an ‚Äúindustrial renaissance‚Äù
</li>
<li>
Make polluters pay
</li>
<li>
Invest trillions into transforming every part of the economy
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some believe Harris shouldn‚Äôt limit herself to the framework of the IRA
as it exists now ‚Äî that she needs to dream bigger and better than
anything seen under the Biden administration. ‚ÄúThe question is: Are we
going to just ride the coattails of the IRA as if this problem is mostly
solved? Or are we going to put forward a whole new, bold vision of how
we can take things on?‚Äù Saul Levin, the political director of the Green
New Deal Network, wondered to me.
</p>
<p>
According to Deveny of Climate Vision, that means continuing to build on
‚Äúour industrial renaissance.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWe have really awakened a sleeping giant of clean industrial
manufacturing in this country to make solar panels, wind turbines, and
batteries,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúWe can also lead the world in clean
industrial manufacturing for steel, cement, and other heavy industry
projects.‚Äù Samaras of Carnegie Mellon, too, shared this vision. ‚ÄúBy the
end of a potential Harris Administration first term, the path to zero
emissions should be visible everywhere,‚Äù he told me. Also on his
wishlist were ‚Äúabundant energy-efficient and affordable housing,
accessible clean mobility infrastructure everywhere, schools and post
offices as community clean energy and resilience hubs, and climate-smart
agriculture and nature-based solutions across the country,‚Äù plus greater
investment in adaptation.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúThe fact is that both the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation
Reduction Act are the largest investments in resilience we‚Äôve ever
done,‚Äù he said. But ‚Äúwe have to think about it the same way we have to
think about mitigation,‚Äù he went on. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the largest thing we‚Äôve ever
done ‚Äî comma, <em><em>so far</em></em>.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
One of the biggest openings for Harris to distinguish herself from
Biden, though, would be by taking a tougher tone with big polluters.
Biden had shown
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-08-30/la-smog-ozone-health-standard-biden-epa-delay" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>less
of an appetite</u></a> for going after businesses, several times
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/16/climate/biden-climate-second-term.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>kicking
the can down the road</u></a> on a decision to what would have been his
second term. Harris, by contrast, is well positioned with her background
as a prosecutor and already went as far as to call for a ‚Äúclimate
pollution fee‚Äù and the creation of an independent Office of Climate and
Environmental Justice and Accountability
<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/kamala-harris-stands-green-new-deal-climate-initiatives/story?id=112152079" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>during
her 2019-2020 campaign</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúWe love seeing her already reference from the stump that there is a lot
that she can do with Congress or through the executive branch to hold
polluters accountable for the toll that they have taken on families and
our climate,‚Äù Moffitt of Evergreen Action told me. ‚ÄúThat could look like
a host of things, from repealing subsidies to using the Department of
Justice to hold polluters accountable.‚Äù Maria Langholz, the senior
director of
<a href="https://team-arc.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Arc
Initiatives</u></a>, a strategy group that works with climate-related
organizations, told me in an email that her team would also like to see
the Harris administration revoke the presidential permit for Enbridge‚Äôs
Line 5 pipeline as high, in addition to developing a public interest
determination ‚Äúthat fully addresses the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/lng-front-line-communities-louisiana" target="_self"><u>social</u></a>,
environmental, and economic impacts of LNG.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
But Levin, more than anyone else, wanted to see Harris pursue a
‚Äúmoonshot campaign from day one,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHoping that tweaking the IRA
is an appropriate solution to climate change is totally out of step with
mainstream scientific consensus. It‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous. At the end
of the day, we need to fundamentally transform our economy so that all
people can survive climate change.‚Äù To have a prayer of meeting the
IRA‚Äôs climate goals ‚Äî let alone putting a meaningful dent in America‚Äôs
contribution to global emissions ‚Äî the U.S. must ‚Äúinvest trillions of
dollars in transforming our transportation system, our building sector,
our food and agriculture sector, and every part of the economy so that
we can create a livable, sustainable world forever that works for
everyone.‚Äù

<h2 id="elon-bought-the-airport">Elon bought the airport</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
Elon Musk bought the biggest airport on the social web. A major world
hub like Atlanta,
<a href="https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-from-london-heathrow-lhr">London</a>
or Dubai.
</p>
<p>
Bluesky is a regional airport in a cool place, maybe Austin.
</p>
<p>
Mastodon is a network of airports, like the ones served by
<a href="https://www.ryanair.com/us/en/cheap-flight-destinations">Ryanair</a>
in Europe.
</p>
<p>
Threads is potentially one of the big airports like the one Musk bought,
but it‚Äôs not as much of a hub yet.
<a href="https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-from-orlando-mco">Orlando</a>?
<a href="https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-from-frankfurt-fra">Frankfurt</a>?
</p>
<p>
There are lots of scheduled flights in and out of X because it‚Äôs where
most of the traffic already goes. It‚Äôs quite possibly not running that
smoothly, like perhaps JFK in NYC, always a mess, under construction,
huge traffic, broken systems.
</p>
<p>
But it does actually work pretty reliably most of the time.
</p>

what their sales were. $1 billion, I said. He said they‚Äôre not going
away. Companies that large don‚Äôt disappear. After 40 years of experience
in tech since then, Bill was right. Companies that lead markets very
rarely disappear. It
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_Computer_Corporation">does</a>
happen. But not often. More likely is Musk will right the ship, and it
will grow to dominate the market. Threads will possibly be Pepsi or
Avis. Mastodon will be Home Depot. Bluesky will be

But there‚Äôs a high probability that Musk‚Äôs company will be the market
leader for the forseeable future.

DC, councilmember arrested on bribery charge</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington ‚Äî¬†A Washington, D.C., councilmember known for promoting
antisemitic conspiracy theories has been arrested on charges that he
accepted over $150,000 in bribes in exchange for using his elected
position to help companies with city contracts, according to court
records unsealed on Monday.</p>
<p>Trayon White Sr., a Democrat who ran an unsuccessful mayoral campaign
in 2022, was arrested on a federal bribery charge by the FBI on Sunday.
He is expected to make his initial court appearance on Monday.</p>
<p>An FBI agent‚Äôs affidavit says White agreed in June to accept roughly
$156,000 in kickbacks and cash payments in exchange for pressuring
government agency employees to extend two companies‚Äô contracts for
violence intervention services. The contacts were worth over $5
million.</p>
<p>White, 40, also accepted a $20,000 bribe payment to help resolve a
contract dispute for one of the companies by pressuring high-level
district officials, the affidavit alleges.</p>
<p>An FBI informant who agreed to plead guilty to fraud and bribery
charges reported giving White gifts including travel to the Dominican
Republic and Las Vegas along with paying him bribes, the FBI said.</p>
<p>White, who has served on the D.C. council since 2017, represents a
predominantly Black ward where the poverty rate is nearly twice as high
as the overall district. He is running for re-election in November
against a Republican challenger.</p>
<p>White‚Äôs chief of staff and communication director didn‚Äôt immediately
respond to emails seeking comment.</p>

<h2 id="dont-mess-with-texas-heat">Don‚Äôt Mess With Texas Heat</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzE3NjAwMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyOTkxOTQ0NX0.YEB3QI9agNQFctKJG4UghBCuWnklNFhCGMwZeCyp2Cw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The heat is chilling out this week, meaning today‚Äôs update is a short
one. If you‚Äôre in the Northeast, start dreaming of pumpkins and hot
cocoa. If you live farther south ‚Ä¶ keep running that AC a little longer.
</p>
<h3>
Fall is in sight ‚Äî for some
</h3>
<p>
Those in the Northeast can start airing out their sweaters this week.
According to Paul Pastelok, AccuWeather senior meteorologist, a
long-lasting jet stream should bring temperatures 5 to 10 degrees
Fahrenheit below historical averages through the end of August. The
region can also expect some precipitation and stronger storms, which
will likely bring down temperatures even more.
</p>
<p>
The Pacific Northwest will also get fall-like weather this week,
Pastelok told me, which will move into the Great Lakes and the Ohio
Valley on Thursday. <strong>For much of the South and the Gulf Coast,
however, forecasts are not looking as optimistic. </strong>Pastelok told
me it‚Äôs possible that both Albuquerque, New Mexico and Lubbock, Texas
will break heat records this week, getting well into the 90s and 100s,
respectively.
</p>
<p>
After a brief respite, the heat will also return to the western Dakotas,
Nebraska, Wyoming, and southeast Montana. Some parts of the Pacific
Northwest that started the week feeling fall-ish might end it back in
summer, as temperatures creep back up on the eastern side of the region.
By Friday, Texas will have it worst.
</p>
<h3>
Park Fire slows down
</h3>
<p>
<strong>The Park Fire seems to have finally halted </strong>‚Äî it hasn‚Äôt
grown past 429,000 acres burned since last week. Containment is now at
53%. and no new counties have been affected.<strong> ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a
reasonable chance that the fire has largely reached its final
footprint,‚Äù </strong>said Climate scientist of the University of
California, Los Angeles Daniel Swain during a live briefing on Friday.
</p>
<p>
After experiencing its hottest July ever, California will finally get a
break from the heat this week as the low pressure along the northwest
coast will send cool air down into California, Pastelok told me. ‚ÄúThe
combination of smoke and westerly winds will cool northern California,
as well as the coastal areas down to southern California,‚Äù he said.
</p>
<p>
But that doesn‚Äôt mean fire conditions are going away, Swain explained.
As long as things stay windy and dry, the risk will remain, and a new
heat wave arriving around the end of August could up the danger even
higher.
</p>
<h3>
Greece‚Äôs worst wildfire of the year almost reached Athens
</h3>
<p>
Gigantic wildfires in Greece stopped just shy of Athens. The fire spread
incredibly quickly last week due to powerful winds, with flames as high
as 80 feet ‚Äî the mayor of Kifisia, Vasilis Xypolitas, told
<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/13/europe/greece-athens-wildfires-evacuation-residents-intl/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>CNN</u></a>
that at one point, the fire was moving faster than cars. Thousands of
residents had to be evacuated.
</p>
<p>
While the flames have since died down, they burned through almost
260,000 acres, causing extensive damage to cities and villages. Houses,
schools, and hospitals have been completely destroyed and many residents
might have to wait weeks before electricity is restored. One death has
been confirmed.
</p>
<p>
The cause of the fire has not yet been determined, but Greece has been
suffering through a particularly hot and dry summer ‚Äî prime conditions
for relentless fires. This year, the country saw its hottest June and
July on record.
</p>
<h3>
Another heat wave in the Balkans
</h3>
<p>
Southeastern Europe has recently seen temperatures above 100 degrees
during a heat wave that is expected to persist this week. This is the
latest heat wave to hit Romania, which has already suffered through
drought and extreme weather this summer. While some rain is predicted
for the country this week, temperatures will continue to run above
average
</p>
<p>
Bosnia has also been particularly hard hit, and farmers there have
noticed a significant impact to production this year. Around Bijeljina,
where most of the country‚Äôs grain production takes place,
<strong>farmers estimate that half their crops have been damaged due to
the heat</strong>. The whole country has seen little to no precipitation
this summer, with temperatures constantly above 95 degrees.

<p class="drop-caps">
For my entire life, I‚Äôve heard politicians talk about bringing
manufacturing jobs back to America. Now it is <em><em>finally</em></em>
happening. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going back!‚Äù has become Kamala Harris‚Äôs
<a href="https://x.com/KamalaHarris" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rallying
cry</u></a>, and it‚Äôs apt here too, because those jobs and industries of
the future are what‚Äôs at stake in this election.
</p>
<p>
The Biden-Harris administration and the 117th Congress enacted a trio of
laws ‚Äî the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, otherwise known as the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law ‚Äî that made major public investments to
cultivate and strengthen several key industries of the future:
semiconductors, electric vehicles, batteries, solar and wind
manufacturing, hydrogen-based energy, and clean steel.
</p>
<p>
Those new laws (and other Biden-Harris Administration actions on trade
and tariffs) have directed and amplified a megatrend in ‚Äúreshoring‚Äù and
driven a huge surge in private sector investments in U.S. manufacturing,
creating tens of thousands of good jobs in communities across America.
Investment in manufacturing construction has
<a href="https://x.com/JesseJenkins/status/1823811245868507216" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than doubled</u></a> since passage of the IRA and CHIPS, and the U.S.
has seen nearly
<a href="https://www.jackconness.com/ira-chips-investments" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>127,000
new jobs created</u></a>, according to Energy Innovation policy analyst
Jack Conness.
</p>

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
Just last week, on the occasion of the IRA‚Äôs two-year anniversary,
Heatmap‚Äôs Emily Pontecorvo wrote about a new report finding that 6,285
utility-scale clean energy projects in the U.S. may be eligible for IRA
tax credits, meaning
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/ira-anniversary-labor" target="_self"><u>3.9
million jobs</u></a>, all of which will be subject to minimum pay
standards if they want the federal rewards.
</p>
<p>
These investments are supporting a diverse set of communities across
America. Of the nearly $71 billion of clean energy manufacturing
investments announced in 2023,
<a href="https://cleaneconomytracker.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than $59 billion</u></a> ‚Äî around 83% ‚Äî were in House districts
represented by Republicans per the
<a href="https://cleaneconomytracker.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Clean
Economy Tracker</u></a>, a partnership between Atlas Public Policy and
Utah State University. That‚Äôs tens of billions of dollars flowing into
rural areas, including a significant chunk going to ‚Äúenergy
communities,‚Äù areas that have historically produced, processed, or
transported fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
We all know that manufacturing plants can be an anchor employer for a
community and play an even more important role than the direct jobs
numbers reveal. The opening of dozens of new advanced manufacturing
plants means dozens of communities across America have a brighter
economic future ‚Äî <strong> </strong>or at least, they do for now.

would, in the words of a
<a href="https://www.thirdway.org/memo/american-manufacturing-is-making-a-comeback-a-second-trump-term-would-send-it-packing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>memo
released</u></a> last week by the center-left think tank Third Way, ‚Äúend
crucial federal investments in US manufacturing, scrap tax incentives
that help U.S. manufacturers compete with China, and make it harder for
U.S. manufacturers to obtain loans.‚Äù It would also have ominous
implications for America‚Äôs geopolitical position in the medium- to
long-term. ‚ÄúFunding basic research and then cutting all subsequent
support, as Trump plans to do, opens the door for other countries to
swoop in and claim market share,‚Äù the authors write. This has happened
before: The U.S. developed much of the solar and battery technology
China is now using to dominate those global markets.
</p>
<p>
That‚Äôs to say nothing of the overall environment of chaos and policy
uncertainty that comes with a Trump presidency, which wreaks havoc on
business investment. Business leaders would be wise to remember
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/09/05/trump-obama-economy/#:~:text=15.%20Business%20investment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>what
it was like</u></a> under Trump 1.0. Trump might promise corporate tax
cuts, but with a strong economy, cooling inflation, and a vibrant
manufacturing renaissance finally underway, the worst thing we could do
is pull the rug out from under the entire U.S. economic policy framework
‚Äî continuity and certainty are good for business.
</p>
<p>
As Greg Sargent
<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/184855/trump-weird-nuclear-moment-elon-musk-kamala-opening" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pointed
out</u></a> in <em><em>The New Republic,</em></em> ‚ÄúAll this gives
Harris an opening.‚Äù The green transition can be exciting, a source of
the kind of joy Harris and her vice presidential nominee, Tim Walz, have
been
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/09/nx-s1-5060012/kamala-harris-tim-walz-campaign-democrats" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>stumping
about</u></a>. ‚ÄúWithout getting entangled in cultural cross-signaling
around fossil fuels, she can argue that the very last thing we should do
is reverse the clean energy boom. It‚Äôs creating lots of jobs building
cool, innovative stuff right in the American heartland.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
I, for one, will be looking to see if this contrast starts to show up in
political ads and speeches at this week‚Äôs Democratic National Convention
‚Äî something like: ‚ÄúHarris will continue investing in U.S. manufacturing
and the industries of the future. Trump will blow that all up. The
choice is on the ballot. And we‚Äôre not going back.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
What future do you choose?

<h2 id="reliable-app-storage-over-time-is-not-here-yet">Reliable app
storage over time is not here yet</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm working on a project which may or may not ship, but it presents an
interesting design challenge either way.
</p>
<p>
The idea is I want to write lots of little bits, less than 5000
characters each, they have titles, use styling, links, include images,
etc.
</p>
<p>
Or it could also be as small as a single emoji.
</p>
<p>
This is what we‚Äôve settled on in 2024 as the basic unit of writing. From
a tweet to a long blog post.
</p>
<p>
I want to make an editor and storage system that fits this model
perfectly based on all we know about this stuff, and the latest server
and network technologies.
</p>
<p>
It should have the best simplest API we know how to make in 2024.
</p>
<p>
In every way it‚Äôll be the nicest, fastest and most flexible way to
create structures of writing over time.
</p>
<p>
In that last sentence is the gotcha ‚Äì <i>over time. </i>It‚Äôs the
frontier, the leading edge. Because in 2024 there‚Äôs no way for me, as an
individual developer to create a structure that lasts over time.
</p>
<p>
I can create a structure that has a high probability of lasting a month.
A pretty good chance of lasting a few years, but beyond that, it gets
less likely probably at a pretty good clip and eventually goes over a
cliff.
</p>
<p>
The way I have answered that in the past was with GitHub.
</p>
<p>
In 2017, I started an
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog">archive</a>
of my <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a> writing on
GitHub. It‚Äôs still just a fraction of my writing, I‚Äôm not doing anything
like that for all my other sites and services. But at least I‚Äôve managed
to set up a system that only requires me to do something once a month,
which is something I like to do because it gives me some assurance the
other mechanisms are still working. Archive systems have bugs too.
</p>
<p>
So I guess for the project I‚Äôm doing I will again use GitHub to mirror
the content in the database until and unless GitHub proves unusable for
this purpose, or something much better comes along.
</p>
<p>
Note that GitHub has made no promise about the continued availability of
their service, all we have to go on is that they have been reliable for
enough time to present the <i>illusion</i> of persistence. <span

<h2
id="feds-pandemic-era-vow-to-prioritize-employment-may-soon-be-tested">Fed‚Äôs
pandemic-era vow to prioritize employment may soon be tested</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington ‚Äî¬†Four years after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell
made fighting unemployment a bigger priority during the COVID-19
pandemic, he faces a pivotal test of that commitment amid rising
joblessness, mounting evidence inflation is under control, and a
benchmark interest rate that is still the highest in a quarter of a
century.¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>High interest rates may be on the way out, with the U.S. central bank
expected to deliver a first cut at its Sept.¬†17-18 meeting and Powell
potentially providing more information about the approach to the policy
easing in a speech on Friday at the Kansas City Fed‚Äôs annual conference
in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>But with the Fed‚Äôs policy rate in the 5.25%-5.50% range for more than
a year, the impact of relatively high borrowing costs on the economy may
still be building and could take time to unwind even if the central bank
starts cutting¬†‚Äî a dynamic that could put hopes for a ‚Äúsoft landing‚Äù of
controlled inflation alongside continued low unemployment at
risk.¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúPowell says the labor market is normalizing,‚Äù with wage growth
easing, job openings still healthy, and unemployment around what
policymakers see as consistent with inflation at the central bank‚Äôs 2%
target, former Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said. ‚ÄúThat would be
great if that is all there is. The history is not good.‚Äù¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>Indeed, increases in the unemployment rate like those seen in recent
months are typically followed by more.¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat does not seem the situation now. But you may only be one or two
poor employment reports away‚Äù from needing aggressive rate cuts to
counter rising joblessness, Evans said. ‚ÄúThe longer you wait, the actual
adjustment becomes harder to make.‚Äù¬†</p>
<p>Inflation versus employment¬†¬†</p>
<p>Evans was a key voice in reframing the Fed‚Äôs policy approach,
unveiled by Powell at Jackson Hole in August 2020 as the pandemic was
raging, policymakers were gathering via video feed, and the unemployment
rate was 8.4%, down from 14.8% that April.¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>In that context the Fed‚Äôs shift seemed logical, changing a
long-standing bias towards heading off inflation at the expense of what
policymakers came to view as an unnecessary cost to the job
market.¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>Standard monetary policymaking saw inflation and unemployment
inextricably and inversely linked: Unemployment below a certain point
stoked wages and prices; weak inflation signaled a moribund job market.
Officials began to rethink that connection after the 2007-2009
recession, concluding they needn‚Äôt treat low unemployment as an
inflation risk in itself.¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>As a matter of equity for those at the job market‚Äôs margins, and to
achieve the best outcomes overall, the new strategy said Fed policy
would ‚Äúbe informed by assessments of the shortfalls of employment from
its maximum level.‚Äù¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis change may appear subtle,‚Äù Powell said in his 2020 speech to
the conference. ‚ÄúBut it reflects our view that a robust job market can
be sustained without causing an outbreak of inflation.‚Äù¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>A pandemic-driven inflation surge and dramatic employment recovery
made that change seem irrelevant: The Fed had to raise rates to tame
inflation, and until recently the pace of price increases had slowed
without much apparent damage to the job market. The unemployment rate
through April had been below 4% for more than two years, an unparalleled
streak not seen since the 1960s. The unemployment rate since 1948 has
averaged 5.7%.¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>But the events of the last two years, and a coming Fed strategy
review, have also triggered a wave of research into exactly what
happened: why inflation fell, what role policy played in that, and how
things might be done differently if inflation risks rise again.¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>While the agenda for this year‚Äôs conference remains under wraps, the
broad theme focuses on how monetary policy influences the economy. That
bears on how officials may evaluate future choices and tradeoffs and the
wisdom of tactics like preempting inflation before it starts.¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>Some of that work is already emerging from Fed researchers, including
top economist Michael Kiley. He has authored a paper questioning whether
policy ‚Äúasymmetry‚Äù¬†‚Äî treating employment shortfalls differently than a
tight labor market, for example¬†‚Äî really helps. Another recent paper
suggested policymakers who believe public inflation expectations are
formed in the short-run and are volatile should react sooner and raise
rates higher in response.¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>The role public expectations play in driving inflation¬†‚Äî and the
policy response - was on full display in 2022. When it appeared
expectations risked moving higher, the Fed pushed its tightening cycle
into overdrive with 75-basis-point hikes at four consecutive meetings.
Powell then used a truncated Jackson Hole speech to emphasize his
commitment to fight inflation ‚Äîa stark shift from his jobs-first
commentary two years earlier.¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>It was a key moment that put the U.S. central bank‚Äôs seriousness on
display, underpinned its credibility with the public and markets, and
rebuilt some of the standing that preemptive policies had lost.¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄòToo tight‚Äô¬†</p>
<p>Powell now faces a test in the other direction. Inflation is
progressing back to 2%, but the unemployment rate has risen to 4.3%, up
eight-tenths of a percentage point from July 2023.¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>There‚Äôs debate over what that really says about the labor market
versus rising labor supply, a positive thing if new job seekers find
employment.¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>But it did breach a rule-of-thumb recession indicator, and while that
has been downplayed given other indicators of a growing economy, it also
is slightly above the 4.2% that Fed officials regard as representing
full employment.¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>It‚Äôs also higher than at any point in Powell‚Äôs pre-pandemic months as
Fed chief: It was 4.1% and falling when he took over in February
2018.¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>The ‚Äúshortfall‚Äù in employment that he promised to respond to four
years ago, in other words, may already be taking shape.¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>While Powell will be reluctant to ever declare victory over inflation
for fear of touching off exuberant overreaction, Ed Al-Hussainy, senior
global rates strategist at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, said it
was past time for the Fed to get in front of the risk to unemployment -
preemption of a different sort.¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>Al-Hussainy said the Fed had proved its ability to keep public
expectations about inflation in check, an important asset, but that
‚Äúalso has put in motion some downside risk to employment.‚Äù¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe policy stance today is offside¬†‚Äî it is too tight¬†‚Äî and that
warrants acting on.‚Äù</p>

<h1 id="2024-08-18-indie-search-for-oddmu">
2024-08-18 Indie search for Oddmu
</h1>
<p>
This is a follow-up for
<a href="2024-08-16-json-feed-for-indexes">2024-08-16 JSON feed for
indexing</a> where I linked to
<a href="https://www.byjp.me/posts/indiesearch/">IndieSearch, byJP</a>.
I want to see what‚Äôs required for this to work.
</p>
<p>
First, I need to install Pagefind. Lucky me, I already have a Rust build
environment installed.
</p>
<pre><code>cargo install pagefind
</code></pre>
<p>
Next, I need a static HTML copy of my site:
</p>
<pre><code>env ODDMU_LANGUAGES=de,en  oddmu static -jobs 3 /tmp/alex
</code></pre>
<p>
Create the index:
</p>
<pre><code>pagefind --site /tmp/alex
</code></pre>
<p>
Upload:
</p>
<pre><code>mv /tmp/alex/pagefind .
make upload
</code></pre>
<p>
It‚Äôs now available at
<code>https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/pagefind</code>.
</p>
<p>
Adding the info to the page header:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;search&quot; type=&quot;application/pagefind&quot; href=&quot;/wiki/pagefind&quot; title=&quot;Alex Schroeder‚Äôs Diary&quot;&gt;
&lt;link href=&quot;/wiki/pagefind/pagefind-ui.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;/wiki/pagefind/pagefind-ui.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) =&gt; {
  new PagefindUI({ element: &quot;#pagefind&quot;, showSubResults: true });
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
And a div to the page body:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div id=&quot;pagefind&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
And I had to add <code>‚Äòunsafe-eval‚Äô</code> to the
<code>script-src</code> Content-Security-Policy header.
</p>
<p>
Too bad the search result links all end in <code>.html</code> ‚Ä¶ that
requires an extra rewrite rule, to get rid of. On the other hand, it
also allowed me to get rid of <code>baseUrl: "/view/"</code>.
</p>
<p>
Since there are still rough edges, this search is only available via
<a href="pagefind.html">Pagefind</a>. I‚Äôm also not promising any updates
to the index.

</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-08-19</strong>. While I was experimenting with this all, I
asked
<a class="account" href="https://hachyderm.io/@byjp" title="@byjp@hachyderm.io"><span
class="citation" data-cites="byjp">@byjp</span></a> some questions.
</p>
<p>
<em>Sites provide local indexes in the Pagefind format, as a static
file?</em>
</p>
<p>
Correct ‚Äî except it‚Äôs many files, organised so as to allow minimal
transfer for a single search query ‚Äî but all can be retrieved to have a
full local index
</p>
<p>
<em>Clients register one or more of these files and allow searching
them?</em>
</p>
<p>
Correct ‚Äî they can be retrieved/cached to query locally, or queried
efficiently remotely.
</p>
<p>
<em>Users can install a large number of them, locally? Like I have 23
local dictionaries installed for my dictd and I can query them,
locally.</em>
</p>
<p>
Yes. Many can be kept locally or remotely. The sites you ‚Äúregister‚Äù/add
become your search index.
</p>
<p>
<em>Is it possible for a website to offer just a Pagefind installation
with a number of URLs to Pagefind indexes without hosting pages and
indexes? Clients visiting this Pagefind installation would download all
the indexes pointed to in the list and search them locally?</em>
</p>
<p>
Yes (with minor hackery). Each Pagefind instance <em>is</em> the index,
a small bootstrapping JS/WASM blob, and ~5 lines of init JS. Those 5
lines can include locations of multiple indexes for the (exclusively
client-side) JS to query when searching; by default the only one
configured is the ‚Äúlocal‚Äù index that created with the Pagefind JS/WASM
blob, but you could strip away an empty index and have what you describe
‚Äî in fact, that‚Äôs what my
<a href="https://www.byjp.me/posts/indiesearch/">IndieSearch</a> demo
does!
</p>
<p>
<em>If instead of visiting a site with a Pagefind installation one
installs a Pagefind browser extensions, is it possible to point it to a
URL that hosts a list of indexes?</em>
</p>
<p>
I haven‚Äôt built that (yet), but yeah ‚Äî I‚Äôd want to build an mf2/IndieWeb
compatible ‚Äúnew user experience‚Äù that‚Äôd guide folks to finding a
good-for-them set of defaults. My demo automatically (provisionally)
adds any site you visit that supports IndieSearch, so you‚Äôd get better
coverage fast. I‚Äôd also consider default-importing from blogrolls and
the like. (Management &amp; performance gets tricky with 1000s of
indexes. Probs an ‚Äúif we get there‚Äù problem. üòÖ)
</p>
<p>
<em>Is it possible to ‚Äúmerge‚Äù Pagefind indexes and pass those aggregates
on? I‚Äôm afraid that having local copies of the indexes means that
clients will have to at least query thousands of sites for updates to
their page indexes.</em>
</p>
<p>
Not yet, but I asked exactly this question of the Pagefind devs and they
offered that it‚Äôs currently too hard, but that there is a potential
route they‚Äôd consider, see
<a href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/pagefind/discussions/564#discussioncomment-8702059">#564</a>.
</p>
<p>
<em>Thank you so much for answering the questions!</em>
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm still thinking about the situation where I‚Äôm part of a community and
we want to all share search, like using
<a href="https://lieu.cblgh.org/">Lieu</a> for a webring ‚Äì except I‚Äôd
like a solution where I don‚Äôt have to do the crawling.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, the communities I‚Äôm part of are planets such as
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/">RPG Planet</a> or
<a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/">Planet Emacslife</a>, each with
hundreds of blogs. I suppose most of them don‚Äôt offer a Pagefind index,
being hosted on Blogspot and Wordpress, but what I‚Äôm considering is
ingesting their feed and indexing it. This could be a service I could
perform for people. Luckily, it‚Äôs often possible to get all the blog
pages via the feed. This is how I‚Äôve made
<a href="2010-05-31_Blognapping">local backups of other people‚Äôs
blogs</a>. I guess that each site would be a separate index, however?
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôd like to find a way that doesn‚Äôt require me to always download all
the pages. I‚Äôd like to find a way to update the index as it‚Äôs being
used.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôd need a way to figure out how to configure it such that the results
link back to the original pages, of course.
</p>
<p>
Another thing I‚Äôm considering is that my own site is rendered live, from
Markdown files‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not a static site. So ideally I‚Äôd be able to ingest
Markdown files directly. Or I can go the route of exporting it all into
a big feed and ingesting that, once I‚Äôve solved the problem above, I
guess. But the problem above might also be easier to solve by extracting
HTML pages from the feed. It‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done in the past. Create
something that works, first, then improve it later?
</p>
<p>
Anyway, ideas are swirling around.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-08-19</strong>. I notice more things that aren‚Äôt quite
working the way I like them to work.
</p>
<p>
The sort order of the results is less than ideal, for example. I like to
emphasize more recent blog posts. Pagefind, however, returns them in
some sort of scoring order so that I‚Äôve seen quite a few results with
pages around 20 years old.
</p>
<p>
Image previews seem to rarely work. I suspect the problem is pages in
subfolders linking to images in that same subfolder. Such relative links
don‚Äôt need a path ‚Äì but they do if Pagefind is not in the same
directory.
</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs another thing to consider: The index takes up more space than the
full HTML of the entire site, compressed!
</p>
<pre><code>alex@sibirocobombus ~&gt; du -sh alexschroeder.ch/wiki/pagefind alexschroeder.ch/wiki/feed.json.gz 
 43M    alexschroeder.ch/wiki/pagefind
9.7M    alexschroeder.ch/wiki/feed.json.gz
</code></pre>
<p>
So the Pagefind index takes about 4√ó more space than the full HTML, for
this site. This matches my experience with better indexing for my own
site where I experimented with full text indexes and trigram indexes.
Back then:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
the 15 MiB of markdown files seem to have generated an index of 70 MiB ‚Äì
<a href="2023-09-11-oddmu">2023-09-11 Odd¬µ memory consumption</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Of course, in terms of copyright incentives, handing off the entire site
like that is tricky. Doing it with a feed feels OK. Doing it for a
search engine seems like handing the keys to Google. This provides an
incentive to use a pre-computed index.
</p>
<p>
It also reminds me that the idea I had of building a search engine out
of feed slurping without consent is probably a bad idea ‚Äì like all ideas
based on non-consensual acts.
</p>
<p>
Whether self-indexing is a good thing in terms of avoiding an
English-first focus I don‚Äôt know. I suspect that most people will be
using free software and therefore there‚Äôs no reason to suspect that a
search engine doesn‚Äôt have the means to process the languages. Then
again, that‚Äôs a lock-in where in order to support a new language, you
have to support the software your favourite search-engine supports. So
people indexing our own pages might have long term benefits.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm still wondering about the comparison of Pagefind and Lunr, to be
honest. How many such static search solutions are there? Is there a
benefit of one implementation over another?
</p>
<p>
I guess now I should look into Pagefind some more? Indexing non-HTML
pages, handling image previews for pages not in the root directory and
relative image source URLs, the sort order of results, the use of the
.html extension in results‚Ä¶ there are still rough edges as far as I am
concerned ‚Äì and per discussion above the onus is on me to fix my
indexing. üò≠

2024-08-16 JSON feed for indexing
</h1>
<p>
Recently,
<a class="account" href="https://toot.cat/@dredmorbius" title="@dredmorbius@toot.cat"><span
class="citation" data-cites="dredmorbius">@dredmorbius</span></a> wrote
about Google and search and posed the question:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What if websites indexed their own content, and published a permuted
index in a standard format, in a cache-and-forward model similar to how
DNS works?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A while ago I wondered about
<a href="2023-03-07_A_vision_for_search">self-published indexes</a>. We
have software to generate feeds. Why not software to generate indexes?
Back then I proposed a JSON format. Today I finally took a look at
<a href="https://www.jsonfeed.org/version/1.1/">JSON Feed</a>. I think
it has everything we need.
</p>
<p>
Take a look at the example for this site:
<a href="/.well-known/search-feed.json.gz">.well-known/search-feed.json.gz</a>.
This file has about 9.7MiB. The source material is 6740 Markdown pages,
a total of about 21.5MiB, or 8.4MiB compressed.
</p>
<p>
Using the <code>next_url</code> attribute, it would be possible to split
this file up into chunks of 100 pages each, or a chunk per year, if the
platform promises that older pages never change. This wouldn‚Äôt work for
my wiki, but perhaps it would for certain platforms.
</p>
<p>
Somebody will have write up a best-practice on how to use HTTP headers
to avoid downloading the whole file when nothing has changed. Sadly,
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-13">section
13 of RFC 2616</a> is pretty convoluted. Basically something about the
use of If-Modified-Since and ETags headers.
</p>
<p>
We also need to agree on how to use some of the JSON Feed attributes.
</p>
<p>
<code>content_text</code>: If used, all markup should be ignored by the
server (no guessing whether the text is Markdown or not). It would be
fine if this contained just the text nodes of the HTML, separated by
spaces. This can be useful to see whether words occur in the text, how
frequent they are, etc.
</p>
<p>
<code>content_html</code>: This is the preferred way to include pages in
the index. It is up to the search engine provider to extract useful
information from the HTML, including summaries, extracts, scoring, etc.
It is up to index providers to provide the kind of HTML they think
serves search engines best. This includes using the semantic HTML tags
and dropping style, scripts, footers and other elements that might be
used by search engines to reduce the relevance of the item.
</p>
<p>
I also find <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5005">RFC
5005</a> to be very instructive in how to think about feeds for
archiving.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://neuromatch.social/@jonny" title="@jonny@neuromatch.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="jonny">@jonny</span></a> commented, saying
that it was important to think about how search indexes were going to be
used:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
so given that no single machine would or should store a whole index of
the internet or even all your local internet, you can go a few ways with
that, take the global quorum sensing path and you get a bigass global
dht-like thing like ipfs. if instead you think there should be some
structure, then you need proximity. is that social proximity where we
swap indexes between people we know? or webring like proximity dependent
on pages linking to each other and mutually indexing their neighborhood?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It‚Äôs an interesting question but I think I want incremental improvements
to the current situation. So if a person has a website right now, on
server, what‚Äôs the simplest thing they can do so that they aren‚Äôt
drowned in crawlers and can still be found via search? That would be
publishing an index, analogous to publishing a feed. Having more search
engines (even if using legacy centralized architecture) would be better
than what we have now. Not depending on crawlers would be better what we
have now.
</p>
<p>
In terms of decentralisation, I think I like community search engines
like lieu. The idea is great: a community lists a bunch of sites. Lieu
generates a web ring and crawls them to build an index of all the member
sites. Instead of crawling, it could fetch the indexes. This would be
much better than what it does right now, because right now, lieu uses
colly for crawling and colly ignores robots.txt. This means that
<a href="2024-06-22-lieu">lieu instantly bans itself when it visits my
site</a> because it‚Äôs not rate limited. It‚Äôs just an implementation
detail, but sadly I am biased. I‚Äôve been on a Butlerian Jihad since 2009
when I discover that <a href="2009-10-15_Network_Traffic">over 30% of
all requests I serve from my sites are for machines, not humans</a>.
</p>
<p>
It makes me want to raise my keyboard and scream ‚ÄúCO‚ÇÇ for the CO‚ÇÇ god!!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Somebody should draw a Hacker Elric doing that, standing on a mountain
of electro-trash with the burnt and dead landscape of the
post-apocalypse in the background.
</p>
<p>
But back to the problem of indexing. Right now, search engine operators
and their parasites, the search engine optimisation enterprises, crawl
every single page including page histories, page diffs, and more, on my
wikis. If every wanna-be search engine downloaded my index once a day, I
would be saving resources. Whether that‚Äôs a step in the right direction,
I don‚Äôt know.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://neuromatch.social/@jonny" title="@jonny@neuromatch.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="jonny">@jonny</span></a> also said:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
i just think that the ability to fundamentally depart from the
commercial structure of the web and all its brokenness doesn‚Äôt happen
gradually and esp.¬†not with the server/client stack we have now
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Indeed, there must be another way. I just don‚Äôt see it, right now. It‚Äôs
always hard to imagine a new world while you‚Äôre still living in the old
one. I‚Äôm sure the solution will seem obvious to the next generation,
looking back.

suggested that this was the same as the sitemaps.org concept, but I
think the sitemap lists the URLs available and you still have to crawl
the site. At least now you never miss a page.
</p>
<p>
Would having such an index generate too much traffic? I think it would
worm if all other crawling would stop. That‚Äôs the necessary trade-off,
of course. No stupid crawlers lost in my wiki admin links (history
pages, diffs) wasting resources ‚Äì that is my goal. Also, since I ask for
a crawl delay, crawling has to reconnect all the time, negotiate TLS all
the time, start up CGI scripts all the time‚Ä¶ having basically a static
snapshot for download would obviate that (in a world where crawlers are
smart enough to understand that the don‚Äôt need to crawl).

<a class="account" href="https://hachyderm.io/@byjp" title="@byjp@hachyderm.io"><span
class="citation" data-cites="byjp">@byjp</span></a>‚Äôs solution to the
problem is even better: the server provides indexes that are used
client-side and a browser extension allows querying multiple such
indexes, locally.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Lunr.js is a small, full-text search library for use in the browser. It
indexes JSON documents and provides a simple search interface for
retrieving documents that best match text queries.
</p>
<p>
After indexing, Pagefind adds a static search bundle to your built
files, which exposes a JavaScript search API that can be used anywhere
on your site. Pagefind also provides a prebuilt UI that can be used with
no configuration. ‚Äì <a href="https://pagefind.app/">Pagefind</a>

Any time they visit the IndieSearch homepage (a page served from their
browser extension) they can now search all the sites supporting
IndieSearch they‚Äôve visited and/or included. ‚Äì

id="years-on-harlem-week-shows-how-a-new-york-city-neighborhood-went-from-crisis-to-renaissance">50
years on, Harlem Week shows how a New York City neighborhood went from
crisis to renaissance</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK ‚Äî¬†In 1974, Harlem‚Äôs deserted streets and tumbledown
tenements told the story of a neighborhood left behind. Decades of
disinvestment had culminated in a mass exodus known as urban flight and
residents watched as their wealthier, more educated counterparts left
the New York City neighborhood in droves.</p>
<p>But the tide turned when Percy Sutton, then the Manhattan borough
president and New York City‚Äôs highest-ranking Black elected official,
launched a campaign to bring back vitality to the historically African
American neighborhood that had been known as a global Black mecca of
arts, culture and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>It became known as Harlem Week and would go on to draw back those who
had departed. On Sunday, organizers celebrated Harlem Week‚Äôs 50th
anniversary after 18 days of free programming that showcased all the
iconic neighborhood has to offer.</p>
<p>Harlem Week stands as ‚Äúthe constant line through the last 50 years of
America‚Äôs most historic Black neighborhood,‚Äù said the Rev.¬†Al Sharpton,
whose National Action Network is headquartered in the neighborhood. ‚ÄúThe
dream of Percy Sutton and his peers in government, arts, the church and
other elements of Harlem lives on, stronger than ever.‚Äù</p>
<p>In the 1970s, Harlem demanded more than an ordinary festival, if it
wanted a resurrection. Those who remained in Harlem during urban flight
‚Äî mostly low-income, Black families ‚Äî would turn on their televisions to
constant despair: crime reports, bleak statistics and reporters who
called their home a ‚Äúsinking ship.‚Äù</p>
<p>Sutton knew Harlem was due for a revitalizing, uplifting moment.</p>
<p>That summer, Sutton rallied religious, political, civic and artistic
leaders that included Tito Puente, Max Roach, Maya Angelou, James
Baldwin, Harry Belafonte, Sidney Poitier, Ruby Dee and Lloyd Williams.
Together, they devised an event that would pivot the spotlight from
Harlem‚Äôs troubles to its vibrant legacy: Harlem Day.</p>
<p>Radio disc jockeys Hal Jackson and Frankie Crocker produced a concert
at the plaza of the Harlem State Office Building, while actor Ossie
Davis cut a ribbon at 138th street and 7th Avenue, announcing the start
of the ‚ÄúSecond Harlem Renaissance.‚Äù</p>
<p>The ribbon-cutting ceremony renamed 7th Avenue to Adam Clayton Powell
Jr.¬†Boulevard, named for the first African American elected to Congress
from New York, marking the first time a New York City street took the
name of a person of color.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAbout two or three weeks later, Percy Sutton called us all and said
it was such a successful day,‚Äù said Lloyd Williams, one of Harlem Day‚Äôs
co-founders and the current president of the Greater Harlem Chamber of
Commerce. ‚ÄúIt meant so much to the other cities that were being deserted
in Detroit and Baltimore, Washington and Chicago, that they asked if we
would do it again on an annual basis.‚Äù</p>
<p>They did, and Harlem Day evolved into Harlem Weekend and eventually
Harlem Week, which, before the pandemic, expanded to a full month of
programming.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOnly in Harlem could a week be more than seven days,‚Äù said Williams,
whose family has lived in Harlem since 1919.</p>
<p>This year‚Äôs celebration featured entertainment, including a
headlining set by hip-hop artist Fabolous, a tribute to Harry Belafonte
and Broadway performances. Other concerts showcased jazz, reggae,
R&amp;B and gospel traditions nurtured in Harlem, alongside hundreds of
food and merchandise vendors.</p>
<p>Organizers also included empowerment initiatives, such as financial
literacy workshops and health screenings, at Harlem Health Village and
the Children‚Äôs Festival. Every child who attended received a
back-to-school backpack.</p>
<p>Harlem Week always has been a living tribute to Harlem‚Äôs history of
greats, such as W.E.B. Du Bois, Langston Hughes, Augusta Savage and
Aaron Douglas. It recognizes the Harlem Renaissance and Black Arts
Movement and honors landmarks like the Apollo Theater and Schomburg
Center for Research in Black Culture.</p>
<p>Many historians consider the late 1960s and the 1970s to be Harlem‚Äôs
darkest years.</p>
<p>The area had been battered by unrest, including a 1964 riot that
killed an unarmed Black teenager, Malcolm X‚Äôs assassination in 1965 and
the turmoil after the Rev.¬†Martin Luther King Jr.‚Äôs assassination in
1968. Household incomes fell dramatically and infant mortality rates
were high.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe neighborhood was blighted,‚Äù recalled Malik Yoba, an actor born
in the Bronx in 1967 who grew up in Harlem and spent days playing in the
dirt of vacant lots. Yoba attended school in the Upper East Side with
peers who had country homes upstate in the Hamptons.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt understand why where we lived looked so dramatically
different than where they lived,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI knew something was
wrong.‚Äù</p>
<p>But Harlemites are creatives and entrepreneurs, visionaries and
leaders. Where others saw decline, they saw opportunity, and the
determination to match Harlem with its potential ran high.</p>
<p>Yoba, now 56, built a career as an actor showcasing Harlem to
audiences across the nation. His experiences with housing inequality
also fueled his passion for real estate.</p>
<p>Yoba combats the effects of redlining through his company Yoba
Development, which provides young people of color access to the industry
and has active projects in Baltimore and New York City.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen you grow up in disenfranchised and divested communities, you
can‚Äôt see the forest through the trees,‚Äù Yoba said. ‚ÄúYou can grow up
believing that walking by burnt-down buildings is your birthright, as
opposed to understanding that building is a business.‚Äù</p>
<p>Hazel Dukes, 92, a prominent New York civil rights activist and
Harlem resident of 30 years, has spent her life fighting discrimination
in housing and education. She lived in the same Harlem building as
Sutton and organized alongside him, later becoming a national president
of the NAACP in 1989.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI know what it feels to be denied,‚Äù said Dukes, who was born and
raised in Montgomery, Alabama, and endured Jim Crow segregation. She
moved to New York City with her parents in the 1950s.</p>
<p>Today, property in Harlem is coveted, driven by gentrification and
its enduring cultural appeal.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere was a waiting list, because everybody wanted to live in
Harlem,‚Äù Dukes said. ‚ÄúPeople want to come to Harlem before they
transition from this world.‚Äù</p>

id="thousands-of-activists-expected-at-democratic-convention-to-call-for-gaza-cease-fire">Thousands
of activists expected at Democratic convention to call for Gaza
cease-fire</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHICAGO ‚Äî¬†Thousands of activists are expected to converge on Chicago
this week for the Democratic National Convention, hoping to call
attention to abortion rights, economic injustice and the war in
Gaza.</p>
<p>While Vice President Kamala Harris has energized crowds of supporters
as she prepares to accept the Democratic nomination, progressive
activists maintain their mission remains the same.</p>
<p>Activists say they learned lessons from last month‚Äôs Republican
National Convention in Milwaukee and are predicting bigger crowds and
more robust demonstrations in Chicago, a city with deep social activism
roots.</p>
<p>Who is protesting?</p>
<p>Demonstrations are expected every day of the convention and, while
their agendas vary, many activists agree an immediate cease-fire in the
Israel-Hamas war is the priority.</p>
<p>Things are set to kick off Sunday on the convention‚Äôs eve with an
abortion rights march along Michigan Avenue.</p>
<p>Organizer Linda Loew said even though Democrats have pushed to
safeguard reproductive rights at home, the issue is international. They
will march in solidarity with people everywhere who struggle for the
right to control what happens to their bodies, as well as to protest the
money the U.S. spends to back wars that could be used for health care,
she said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe believe that the billions of dollars that continue to flow to the
state of Israel and the flow of weapons are having an inordinate and
horrific impact, but in particular on women, children and the unborn,‚Äù
she said. ‚ÄúAll of these things are tied together.‚Äù</p>
<p>The largest group, the Coalition to March on the DNC, has planned
demonstrations on the first and last days of the convention.</p>
<p>Organizers say they expect at least 20,000 activists, including
students who protested the war on college campuses.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe people with power are going to be there,‚Äù said Liz Rathburn, a
University of Illinois Chicago student organizer. ‚ÄúPeople inside the
United Center are the people who are going to be deciding our foreign
policy in one way or another.‚Äù</p>
<p>Where are they protesting?</p>
<p>Activists sued the city earlier this year, saying restrictions over
where they can demonstrate violate their constitutional rights.</p>
<p>Chicago leaders rejected their requests for permits to protest near
United Center on the city‚Äôs West Side, where the convention is taking
place, offering instead a lakefront park more than 5 kilometers
away.</p>
<p>Later, the city agreed to allow demonstrations at a park and a march
route closer to the United Center. A federal judge recently signed off
on the group‚Äôs roughly 1.6-kilometer route.</p>
<p>Coalition to March on the DNC spokesman Hatem Abudayyeh said the
group is pleased it won the right to protest closer to the convention,
but he believes its preferred 3-kilometer march would be safer for
larger crowds. The group is chartering buses for activists from about
half a dozen states.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going forward, full speed ahead,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>The city has designated a park about a block from United Center for a
speakers‚Äô stage. Those who sign up get 45 minutes.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia-based Poor People‚Äôs Army, which advocates for
economic justice, plans to set up at Humboldt Park on the city‚Äôs
Northwest Side and will feature events with third-party candidates Jill
Stein and Cornel West, plus a march Monday to the United Center.</p>
<p>Some group members have spent the last few weeks marching the more
than 130 kilometers from Milwaukee, where they protested during the
Republican convention.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPoor and homeless people are being brutalized, with tents and
encampments destroyed and bulldozed away, from San Francisco to
Philadelphia to Gaza and the West Bank,‚Äù spokesperson Cheri Honkala said
in a statement as the group reached Illinois. ‚ÄúThese preventable human
rights violations are being committed by Democratic and Republican
leaders alike.‚Äù</p>
<p>How does a new nominee change things?</p>
<p>Many activists believe nothing much will change because Harris is
part of the Biden administration.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe demands haven‚Äôt changed. I haven‚Äôt seen any policy changes,‚Äù
said Erica Bentley, an activist with Mamas Activating Movements for
Abolition and Solidarity. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to be here, you‚Äôre going to
have to listen to what‚Äôs important to us.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pro-Palestinian protesters in Chicago have been highly visible,
shutting down roads to the airport and staging sit-ins at congressional
offices. Some are planning their own one-day convention Sunday with
third-party candidates.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRegardless of who the nominee is, we‚Äôre marching against the
Democrats and their vicious policies that have allowed Israel to kill
over 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza,‚Äù said Fayaani Aboma Mijana, an
organizer with the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political
Repression.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs unclear if the convention will draw far-right extremists who
ardently support former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Secret Service Deputy Special Agent in Charge Derek Mayer said last
week there are no known specific security threats against the
convention.</p>
<p>Is Chicago ready?</p>
<p>The convention will draw an estimated 50,000 people to the nation‚Äôs
third-largest city, including delegates, activists and journalists.</p>
<p>The city says it has made necessary preparations with police and the
Secret Service. Security will be tight, with street closures around the
convention center.</p>
<p>To combat traffic concerns, city leaders are touting a new $80
million train station steps from the United Center. They also have tried
to beautify the city with freshly planted flowers and new signs. City
leaders also cleared a nearby homeless encampment.</p>
<p>Police have undergone training on constitutional policing, county
courts say they are opening more space in anticipation of mass arrests
and hospitals near the security zone are beefing up emergency
preparedness.</p>
<p>Authorities and leaders in the state have said people who vandalize
the city or are violent will be arrested.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to make sure that people have their First Amendment
rights protected, that they can do that in a safe way,‚Äù Mayor Brandon
Johnson told The Associated Press in a recent interview.</p>
<p>But some have lingering safety concerns, worried that protests could
become unpredictable or devolve into chaos.</p>
<p>Activist Hy Thurman protested and was arrested at the infamous 1968
convention. The 74-year-old now lives in Alabama but plans to come to
Chicago to protest the war in Gaza.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs extremely personal for me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI see parallels.‚Äù</p>
<p>Illinois Gov.¬†JB Pritzker has said that he expects peaceful
protests.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe intend to protect the protesters‚Äô First Amendment rights, and
also the residents of the city of Chicago and the visitors to Chicago at
the same time,‚Äù Pritzker told the AP in a recent interview.</p>
