“in” for 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-18, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Globally, the total value of mergers and acquisitions last year was the
lowest since in a decade, held back by interest rates, a volatile stock
market and a strict regulatory environment. The corporate dealmaking
could rebound this year, though. We’ll also paint a picture of our
economic moment with a slew of recent data. Plus, could passwords be a
thing of the past?

<p>BTW, did you notice how BMW’s ads say their product is much better
than Tesla’s, without mentioning Tesla, they just say they’re better,
because they are just better, because they’re BMW, and they know you
know that. It’s much more powerful esp with people who like Telsas (of
which I am one). I also see the Tesla as a very capable replacement for
my 2007 BMW 535i, which I donated to charity in 2012, which I loved for
the same reasons I love the Tesla. Putting down the competition isn’t
what marketing is about, you have to think about the people whose minds
you’re trying to change, and know you’re in it for the long haul.</p>

much had been made of this, esp since the current management has been
coasting on innovation done by

hadn’t released anything that wasn’t completely predictable since his

any positive reviews coming out from the privileged press, who we know
in advance to discount, these are the press people Apple can count on to
not say a negative word, to preserve their access at least, if not
because they are complete fans. It reeks of a loser product. I write

Demon-haunted computers are back, baby (17 Jan 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-18, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Demon-haunted computers are back, baby: Surely no one
will ever find a way to abuse this security system that treats the
computer’s owner as an attacker. Hey look at this: Delights to
delectate. This day in history: 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent
publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects,
current reading Demon-haunted computers are back, baby (permalink) As a
science fiction writer, I am professionally irritated by a lot of sf
movies. Not only do those writers get paid a lot more than I do, they
insist on including things like “self-destruct” buttons on the bridges
of their starships. Look, I get it. When the evil empire is closing in
on your flagship with its secret transdimensional technology, it’s
important that you keep those secrets out of the emperor’s hand. An
irrevocable self-destruct switch there on the bridge gets the job done!
(It has to be irrevocable, otherwise the baddies’ll just swarm the
bridge and toggle it off). But c’mon. If there’s a facility built into
your spaceship that causes it to explode no matter what the people on
the bridge do, that is also a pretty big security risk! What if the bad
guy figures out how to hijack the measure that – by design – the people
who depend on the spaceship as a matter of life and death can’t detect
or override? I mean, sure, you can try to simplify that self-destruct
system to make it easier to audit and assure yourself that it doesn’t
have any bugs in it, but remember Schneier’s Law: anyone can design a
security system that works so well that they themselves can’t think of a
flaw in it. That doesn’t mean you’ve made a security system that works –
only that you’ve made a security system that works on people stupider
than you. I know it’s weird to be worried about realism in movies that
pretend we will ever find a practical means to visit other star systems
and shuttle back and forth between them (which we are very, very
unlikely to do):
https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/09/astrobezzle/#send-robots-instead But
this kind of foolishness galls me. It galls me even more when it happens
in the real world of technology design, which is why I’ve spent the past
quarter-century being very cross about Digital Rights Management in
general, and trusted computing in particular. It all starts in 2002,
when a team from Microsoft visited our offices at EFF to tell us about
this new thing they’d dreamed up called “trusted computing”:
https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/05/trusting-trust/#thompsons-devil The
big idea was to stick a second computer inside your computer, a very
secure little co-processor, that you couldn’t access directly, let alone
reprogram or interfere with. As far as this “trusted platform module”
was concerned, you were the enemy. The “trust” in trusted computing was
about other people being able to trust your computer, even if they
didn’t trust you. So that little TPM would do all kinds of cute tricks.
It could observe and produce a cryptographically signed manifest of the
entire boot-chain of your computer, which was meant to be an unforgeable
certificate attesting to which kind of computer you were running and
what software you were running on it. That meant that programs on other
computers could decide whether to talk to your computer based on whether
they agreed with your choices about which code to run. This process,
called “remote attestation,” is generally billed as a way to identify
and block computers that have been compromised by malware, or to
identify gamers who are running cheats and refuse to play with them. But
inevitably it turns into a way to refuse service to computers that have
privacy blockers turned on, or are running stream-ripping software, or
whose owners are blocking ads:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/02/self-incrimination/#wei-bai-bai After
all, a system that treats the device’s owner as an adversary is a
natural ally for the owner’s other, human adversaries. The rubric for
treating the owner as an adversary focuses on the way that users can be
fooled by bad people with bad programs. If your computer gets taken over
by malicious software, that malware might intercept queries from your
antivirus program and send it false data that lulls it into thinking
your computer is fine, even as your private data is being plundered and
your system is being used to launch malware attacks on others. These
separate, non-user-accessible, non-updateable secure systems serve a
nubs of certainty, a remote fortress that observes and faithfully
reports on the interior workings of your computer. This separate system
can’t be user-modifiable or field-updateable, because then malicious
software could impersonate the user and disable the security chip. It’s
true that compromised computers are a real and terrifying problem. Your
computer is privy to your most intimate secrets and an attacker who can
turn it against you can harm you in untold ways. But the widespread
redesign of out computers to treat us as their enemies gives rise to a
range of completely predictable and – I would argue – even worse harms.
Building computers that treat their owners as untrusted parties is a
system that works well, but fails badly. First of all, there are the
ways that trusted computing is designed to hurt you. The most reliable
way to enshittify something is to supply it over a computer that runs
programs you can’t alter, and that rats you out to third parties if you
run counter-programs that disenshittify the service you’re using. That’s
how we get inkjet printers that refuse to use perfectly good third-party
ink and cars that refuse to accept perfectly good engine repairs if they
are performed by third-party mechanics:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/24/rent-to-pwn/#kitt-is-a-demon It’s how
we get cursed devices and appliances, from the juicer that won’t squeeze
third-party juice to the insulin pump that won’t connect to a
third-party continuous glucose monitor:
https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/unauthorized-bread-a-near-future-tale-of-refugees-and-sinister-iot-appliances/
But trusted computing doesn’t just create an opaque veil between your
computer and the programs you use to inspect and control it. Trusted
computing creates a no-go zone where programs can change their behavior
based on whether they think they’re being observed. The most prominent
example of this is Dieselgate, where auto manufacturers murdered
hundreds of people by gimmicking their cars to emit illegal amount of
NOX. Key to Dieselgate was a program that sought to determine whether it
was being observed by regulators (it checked for the telltale signs of
the standard test-suite) and changed its behavior to color within the
lines. Software that is seeking to harm the owner of the device that’s
running it must be able to detect when it is being run inside a
simulation, a test-suite, a virtual machine, or any other hallucinatory
virtual world. Just as Descartes couldn’t know whether anything was real
until he assured himself that he could trust his senses, malware is
always questing to discover whether it is running in the real universe,
or in a simulation created by a wicked god:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/28/descartes-was-an-optimist/#uh-oh
That’s why mobile malware uses clever gambits like periodically checking
for readings from your device’s accelerometer, on the theory that a
virtual mobile phone running on a security researcher’s test bench won’t
have the fidelity to generate plausible jiggles to match the real data
that comes from a phone in your pocket:
https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/01/google-play-malware-used-phones-motion-sensors-to-conceal-itself/
Sometimes this backfires in absolutely delightful ways. When the
Wannacry ransomware was holding the world hostage, the security
researcher Marcus Hutchins noticed that its code made reference to a
very weird website: iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com.
Hutchins stood up a website at that address and every Wannacry-infection
in the world went instantly dormant:
https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/10/flintstone-delano-roosevelt/#the-matrix
It turns out that Wannacry’s authors were using that ferkakte URL the
same way that mobile malware authors were using accelerometer readings –
to fulfill Descartes’ imperative to distinguish the Matrix from reality.
The malware authors knew that security researchers often ran malicious
code inside sandboxes that answered every network query with fake data
in hopes of eliciting responses that could be analyzed for weaknesses.
So the Wannacry worm would periodically poll this nonexistent website
and, if it got an answer, it would assume that it was being monitored by
a security researcher and it would retreat to an encrypted blob, ceasing
to operate lest it give intelligence to the enemy. When Hutchins put a
webserver up at iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com, every
Wannacry instance in the world was instantly convinced that it was
running on an enemy’s simulator and withdrew into sulky hibernation. The
arms race to distinguish simulation from reality is critical and the
stakes only get higher by the day. Malware abounds, even as our devices
grow more intimately woven through our lives. We put our bodies into
computers – cars, buildings – and computers inside our bodies. We
absolutely want our computers to be able to faithfully convey what’s
going on inside them. But we keep running as hard as we can in the
opposite direction, leaning harder into secure computing models built on
subsystems in our computers that treat us as the threat. Take UEFI, the
ubiquitous security system that observes your computer’s boot process,
halting it if it sees something it doesn’t approve of. On the one hand,
this has made installing GNU/Linux and other alternative OSes vastly
harder across a wide variety of devices. This means that when a vendor
end-of-lifes a gadget, no one can make an alternative OS for it, so off
the landfill it goes. It doesn’t help that UEFI – and other trusted
computing modules – are covered by Section 1201 of the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which makes it a felony to publish
information that can bypass or weaken the system. The threat of a
five-year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine means that UEFI and other
trusted computing systems are understudied, leaving them festering with
longstanding bugs:
https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/09/free-sample/#que-viva Here’s where it
gets really bad. If an attacker can get inside UEFI, they can run
malicious software that – by design – no program running on our
computers can detect or block. That badware is running in “Ring -1” – a
zone of privilege that overrides the operating system itself. Here’s the
bad news: UEFI malware has already been detected in the wild:
https://securelist.com/cosmicstrand-uefi-firmware-rootkit/106973/ And
here’s the worst news: researchers have just identified another
exploitable UEFI bug, dubbed Pixiefail:
https://blog.quarkslab.com/pixiefail-nine-vulnerabilities-in-tianocores-edk-ii-ipv6-network-stack.html
Writing in Ars Technica, Dan Goodin breaks down Pixiefail, describing
how anyone on the same LAN as a vulnerable computer can infect its
firmware:
https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/01/new-uefi-vulnerabilities-send-firmware-devs-across-an-entire-ecosystem-scrambling/
That vulnerability extends to computers in a data-center where the
attacker has a cloud computing instance. PXE – the system that Pixiefail
attacks – isn’t widely used in home or office environments, but it’s
very common in data-centers. Again, once a computer is exploited with
Pixiefail, software running on that computer can’t detect or delete the
Pixiefail code. When the compromised computer is queried by the
operating system, Pixiefail undetectably lies to the OS. “Hey, OS, does
this drive have a file called ‘pixiefail?’” “Nope.” “Hey, OS, are you
running a process called ‘pixiefail?’” “Nope.” This is a self-destruct
switch that’s been compromised by the enemy, and which no one on the
bridge can de-activate – by design. It’s not the first time this has
happened, and it won’t be the last. There are models for helping your
computer bust out of the Matrix. Back in 2016, Edward Snowden and bunnie
Huang prototyped and published source code and schematics for an
“introspection engine”:
https://assets.pubpub.org/aacpjrja/AgainstTheLaw-CounteringLawfulAbusesofDigitalSurveillance.pdf
This is a single-board computer that lives in an ultraslim shim that you
slide between your iPhone’s mainboard and its case, leaving a ribbon
cable poking out of the SIM slot. This connects to a case that has its
own OLED display. The board has leads that physically contact each of
the network interfaces on the phone, conveying any data they transit to
the screen so that you can observe the data your phone is sending
without having to trust your phone. (I liked this gadget so much that I
included it as a major plot point in my 2020 novel Attack Surface, the
third book in the Little Brother series):
https://craphound.com/attacksurface/ We don’t have to cede control over
our devices in order to secure them. Indeed, we can’t ever secure them
unless we can control them. Self-destruct switches don’t belong on the
bridge of your spaceship, and trusted computing modules don’t belong in
your devices. (Image: Mike, CC BY-SA 2.0, modified) Hey look at this

Russian cyberspies linked to the Kremlin’s Federal Security Service
(FSB) are moving beyond their usual credential phishing antics and have
developed a custom backdoor that they started delivering via email as
far back as November 2022, according to Google’s Threat Analysis Group.…

funding for climate adaptation</a> in poorer countries, among other
things. What would his return really mean for the climate movement on a
national and global scale? Here’s a quick opinion roundup:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The stakes couldn’t be higher: </strong>Trump won’t be able to
stop the green energy transition that’s already underway, but he could
slow it down, U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry told
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0ea1ef1b12&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg
TV</a>. “The marketplace is going to support this transition and it’s
irrevocable now — we’re going to get there. The only question is if
we’re going to get there in time to not be ravaged by the worst
consequences of the climate crisis.”
</li>
<li>
<strong>Gutting the IRA would be very unpopular: </strong>Many
clean-energy programs funded by President Biden’s signature climate bill
are in red states,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=67e5d1cca6&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted
<em>The Economist</em></a>. If Trump nixes them, “he may face pushback
from his own party,” not to mention business leaders. Some automakers,
like GM and Nissan, are already warning against the move.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Trump can’t stop the global momentum:</strong> Of course the
U.S. president’s views on climate matter, but “the world’s in a slightly
different place than it was five years ago,” World Bank President Ajay
Banga
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e8a7b3af3d&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told
<em>Politico</em></a>. The bank helps finance climate adaptation in
developing countries, and is pushing for more private sector investment
in renewables. Banga suggested international momentum on these issues is
“much bigger than just the U.S. and the EU.”

that concerns about climate change have “a significant and growing
effect on voting that favors the Democrats” and “that climate change
opinion probably cost Republicans the 2020 presidential election, all
else being equal.”

<li>The South smashes electricity records
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>The Tennessee Valley Authority, America’s largest
public power company, just set a new record for electricity usage thanks
to the cold weather system hammering huge sections of the country,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=7403f5b09c&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports
<em>Heatmap</em>’s Matthew Zeitlin</a>. Consumers used around 34,500
megawatts of electricity yesterday morning, about 1,000 megawatts more
than its previous all-time record of around 33,500 megawatts in August
2007. Like much of the region, Tennesseans largely heat their homes
using electricity as opposed to fuel oil or natural gas. Cold mornings
are particularly challenging for the authority because lots of people
are trying to heat their chilly homes between waking up and going to
work or school. “By contrast, summer afternoons and early evenings are
tough for grids to manage because temperatures stay high even as the sun
goes down and people return to their homes and cool them and start
operating appliances,” Zeitlin explains. The cold snap is expected to
last through the weekend.

<li>Study: Greenland is losing way more ice than experts thought
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>The Greenland ice sheet has lost 20% more ice than
scientists previously thought due to global warming, according to new
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=56b8a3ebbd&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research</a>
published in the journal <em>Nature</em>. The researchers came to this
conclusion by looking at the amount of glacial ice lost around the edges
of the sheet, an area that earlier estimates overlooked. Experts worry
the huge amounts of fresh water pouring into the north Atlantic could
disrupt ocean currents and wreak havoc on global weather patterns.

EU needs to sharply decrease the use of fossil fuels, and almost fully
phase out the use of coal and fossil gas in public electricity and heat
generation by 2040,” the advisers said. The report urges the EU to work
quickly to put planned climate policies into law. The timing of the
report is interesting because, as the <em>Financial Times

rhetoric about the social costs of switching away from fossil fuels to

Breakfast — and its more formal cousin, brunch — is “in” for 2024.
Consumers like that they’re able to spend less money than they would on
a dinner out while still feeling like they’re treating themselves.
Meanwhile, restaurants love the profit margins. Also on this morning’s
show: flipping through the pages of the Beige Book and analyzing the
average workweek in China.

like Google introduce “passkeys” as a default login for online users.
But with the rise of deepfake technology, is any method of verifying our

Pyongyang Tries To Create Seoul-Tokyo Friction to Harm US Relations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is trying to create
friction between Tokyo and Seoul, South Korea, and undermine their
trilateral relations with the United States as security cooperation
among them deepens, analysts said.  </p>
<p>Washington, Seoul and Tokyo conducted trilateral naval drills in the
international waters south of Jeju Island from Monday to Wednesday, said
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS).   </p>
<p>The exercises involving nine ships, including the USS Carl Vinson, a
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, were aimed at enhancing deterrence
against North Korean nuclear, missile and underwater threats, the JCS
said. </p>
<p>North Korea is taking an increasingly hostile stance toward South
Korea. Calling for the amendment of its constitution to refer to South
Korea as its “principal enemy,” Kim said Pyongyang should plan for
occupying South Korea if war breaks out.   </p>
<p>He made the remarks in a speech on Monday to the Supreme Assembly,
the country’s rubber-stamp parliament, said state media KCNA. </p>
<p>A day earlier, North Korea test-fired what it said was a solid fuel
intermediate range ballistic missile with a hypersonic warhead.</p>
<p>Pyongyang also fired more than 200 rounds of artillery shells near
Yeonpyeong Island on a disputed maritime border with South Korea on
January 5 and more than 60 rounds near the same island on January 7.
Yeonpyeong Island is about 120 kilometers west of Seoul. </p>
<p>While escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula, Kim sent a message
to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on January 5 conveying sympathy over a
powerful earthquake that shook Ishikawa prefecture, leaving at least 200
people dead and more than 200 missing as the new year began.  </p>
<p>In the message, Kim expressed “his deep sympathy and condolences” to
Kishida for losses caused by the earthquake, KCNA reported on January 6.
 </p>
<p>Analysts said although North Korea has relayed condolence messages to
Japan after disasters in the past, this is the first time Kim personally
reached out to a Japanese prime minister.</p>
<p>“While Kim Jong Un may wish to drive a wedge between Japan and the
ROK, the real intention, subtle but still real, is to drive a wedge
between Japan and America, in spite of last year’s successes at Camp
David in the trilateral summit,” said Kenneth Dekleva, a senior fellow
at the George H.W. Bush Foundation for U.S.-China Relations.</p>
<p>At the Camp David summit, U.S. President Joe Biden, South Korean
President Yoon Suk Yeol, and Kishida agreed to cooperate on multiple
measures to bolster deterrence against North Korea.</p>
<p>Dekleva, who served as a State Department psychiatrist analyzing
foreign leaders including Kim from 2006 to 2016, continued, “Another
intention of equal importance is to test the U.S.-ROK relationship,
especially given the recent dangerous, bellicose threats of war made
recently by Kim Jong Un.”  </p>
<p>Kim ordered his military forces to prepare for war with the U.S. and
“South Korean puppets and Japs,” according to KCNA, describing Kim’s
speech made at a planning meeting of his ruling Workers’ Party on
December 31.</p>
<p>Pyongyang has been critical of the trilateral ties forged after Seoul
and Tokyo mended relations in March. Disputes rooted in Japan’s
colonization of the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945 had strained
relations for decades.  </p>
<p>Ken Gause, an expert on North Korea’s leadership and political system
at the Center for Naval Analyses,  said Kim’s message also signals
Pyongyang could be “keeping its options open for engagement.”  </p>
<p>“North Korea is trying to put Japan in a situation where it has to
choose between its own self-interest and the self-interest of the
alliance as a whole,” he said.  </p>
<p>Kishida said in May that he is willing to meet Kim to discuss the
return of Japanese who were abducted by North Korea in the 1960s and
1970s.  </p>
<p>At North Korea’s summit with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro
Koizumi in September 2002, Kim’s father, Kim Jong Il, admitted the
country had abducted 12 Japanese nationals. North Korea returned five of
them to Japan in October of that year. </p>
<p>Japan says North Korea abducted 17 Japanese citizens in the 1970s to
1980s.  </p>
<p>Shihoko Goto, Asia program director at the Wilson Center, said, “The
abduction issue remains a highly emotional agenda in Japan, and moving
forward to seek a resolution is high on the agenda of Kishida’s
government.” </p>
<p>She added that Kim’s message of condolence “was seen favorably in
Tokyo and seen as an opportunity for greater dialogue, if not improved
relations, between the two countries.” </p>
<p>However, she said, Tokyo will be “in lockstep” with Seoul and
Washington in deterring North Korea, as Pyongyang also is “an
existential threat” to Japan.</p>

fell out of favor of manufacturers (“bigger is more better”). Now if one
wanted to get tiny laptop – one of the few opportunities would have been
to fight for old Sony UMPC’s on ebay which are somewhat expensive even
today. Recently Raspberry Pi/CM4-based tiny laptops started to appear –
especially clockwork products are neat, but they are not foldable like a
laptop. When in summer of 2023 Sipeed announced Lichee Console 4A based
on RISC-V SoC – I preordered it immediately and in early January I
finally received it. Results of my testing, currently uncovered issues

id="frigid-weather-compounds-chicagos-struggles-to-house-asylum-seekers">Frigid
Weather Compounds Chicago’s Struggles to House Asylum-Seekers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>chicago — As temperatures hover below freezing in Chicago, dozens of
asylum-seekers are staying in the lower level of a library until the
bitter cold gripping much of the country lifts. </p>
<p>But after that, Chicago’s plans for offering immediate shelter to the
growing number of migrants arriving in the nation’s third-largest city
remain murky. </p>
<p>For more than a year, Chicago has wrestled with how to house new
arrivals until shelter space is free, utilizing measures that city
leaders insist are a stopgap. Last week, it was parked city buses.
Before that it was police station lobbies and airports. The makeshift
approach has frazzled volunteers, nonprofit groups and migrants wary of
the lack of a long-term plan, particularly during the city’s long
winters. </p>
<p>“The city’s favorite word for everything is ‘temporary,’” said
Vianney Marzullo, a volunteer who has helped migrants staying at O’Hare
International Airport. “It’s their new choice of Band-Aid word.
Everything is temporary, temporary, temporary.” </p>
<p>Chicago has struggled, like New York and Denver, to deal with the
crisis that started in 2022 when migrants began arriving in
Democratic-led cities, largely at the direction of Texas Governot Greg
Abbott. The winter weather has further complicated efforts. Last week,
New York, which has received more than 170,000 migrants, evacuated a
massive tent camp ahead of a storm. Big-city mayors have asked
repeatedly for more federal help. </p>
<p>Chicago’s response has stood out for its haphazard approach with a
heavy reliance on volunteers who have spent more than a year providing
medical care, food and donated items. </p>
<p>City leaders say the situation keeps changing and there have been
snags along the way. </p>
<p>Mayor Brandon Johnson floated the idea of a heated tent encampment,
but construction was scrapped over the risk of contaminants at the
former industrial site. </p>
<p>The city had instituted a 60-day limit for shelter stays but pushed
the first batch of notices off to next week because of the weather.
Meanwhile, the city has been heavily criticized for conditions at its
shelters and the death of a young boy whose family stayed at one. </p>
<p>The political fight has also heated up and spread to the
suburbs. </p>
<p>Abbott’s busing operation has been dropping off migrants at all hours
in different Chicago area cities without coordination. When the city
began fining bus companies and filing lawsuits, Abbott fired back with
chartered planes. Johnson had planned a summit for this week with
suburban mayors to discuss the problem; it was canceled by the weather.
His office didn’t return a request for comment Wednesday. </p>
<p>“This is an international crisis that requires federal intervention
of which local government is subsidizing that work. Never designed to do
it, but yet here we are still standing,” Johnson said last week ahead of
the storm. </p>
<p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker also wrote to Abbott last week asking
to suspend buses until the temperatures rise and with many migrants
arriving without winter coats or shoes. But Abbott rejected the notion,
saying the federal government needs to step up. </p>
<p>More than 33,000 migrants, mostly from Venezuela, have arrived in
Chicago since 2022. Currently, nearly 15,000 migrants are living in 28
shelters and the city is continually opening more. Many migrants have
gone elsewhere or live with family and friends in the area. Chicago,
like other cities, has offered bus tickets out of the city. </p>
<p>The city wound down its much-maligned use of police stations to house
migrants, but O’Hare International Airport is still being used, with
some asylum-seekers staying for weeks at a time as they await shelter.
More than 200 were there Wednesday, according to the city. </p>
<p>Until the weather turned, the city was keeping migrants aboard eight
city buses that were running continuously and parked near a downtown
highway in an area designated “the landing zone.” </p>
<p>Six heated tents are under construction nearby, which the city says
will be used for intake and services, such as medical care. It’s unclear
if they will also be used for housing. </p>
<p>Marylin Gonzalez, 34, slept on the buses last week along with her
husband and three children, ages 15, 16 and 18. The buses were crowded,
with sicknesses spreading quickly. </p>
<p>Gonzalez described the atmosphere aboard as tense, with many worried
about where they would go. She said it made her feel like a
prisoner. </p>
<p>“The children are stressed. People get stressed, they argue, they are
already desperate,” she said. “Sometimes we have to sleep sitting up
because there is no space to lay down.” </p>
<p>Outside the buses, many would take up activities, like throwing
around a football, to keep warm. </p>
<p>The landing zone was cleared of people and vehicles on Monday, but by
Wednesday morning, the empty warming buses were parked there again, a
signal that the city intends to return to using them. The city’s Office
of Emergency Management didn’t respond to questions Wednesday about the
city’s plans when the weather warms. </p>
<p>Roughly 50 migrants were staying in the lower level of the Harold
Washington Library Center, the city’s flagship location downtown during
the cold snap, according to people staying there. Migrants, including
those who came in on their own to avoid the cold, were living with
others facing homelessness. According to the city’s tally, 5 migrants at
the library site were on lists for shelters. An Associated Press
reporter was not allowed inside. </p>
<p>Angel Alberto Chourio, 30, slept there over the weekend, saying he
was trying to figure out his next steps. He and a friend arrived from
Venezuela last year. The promise of work out of state didn’t pan out, so
they came back to Chicago recently. Without any place else to go, they
came to the library. </p>
<p>He said Wednesday that he was nervous about the shelter stay limits
and was not on a waiting list for one. </p>
<p>“We are not used to this. The cold is too much, since it is already
below zero,” he said, looking for a silver lining. “At least they give
one a chance to continue living.”</p>

Convenes Top Congressional Leaders to Discuss Ukraine Aid, US Border
Deal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden convened top congressional
leaders at the White House to underscore Ukraine’s security needs, a
meeting that comes at a pivotal time as senators narrow on a landmark
immigration deal that could unlock $110 billion in stalled aid to
Ukraine, Israel and other U.S. allies.</p>
<p>But Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republicans used the face-to-face
moment with Biden to push him for tougher border security measures, with
the speaker telling the president that Republican lawmakers were
demanding “substantive policy change” and insisting that the White
House’s executive actions on immigration had weakened the border.</p>
<p>“We understand that there’s concern about the safety, security and
sovereignty of Ukraine,” Johnson told reporters after the meeting, which
ran for more than an hour. “But the American people have those same
concerns about our own domestic sovereignty and our safety and our
security.”</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, also speaking to reporters
after the meeting, stressed that Biden has repeatedly said he is willing
to compromise on certain border measures and that any effort in a
divided Congress must be bipartisan. House Republicans have insisted on
passage of a hard-line border security measure that has no Democratic
support on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>“There was a large amount of agreement around the table that we must
do Ukraine, and we must do border,” he said.</p>
<p>The White House called the meeting with lawmakers — including
Johnson, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader
Chuck Schumer, and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell — to brief
them on Ukraine’s current need for weapons and other aid, which the
White House described as “desperate” and “urgent.”</p>
<p>By populating the meeting with national security leaders, the meeting
was expected to impress on the new speaker the importance of the aid
package and the current U.S. approach to world affairs. The Republicans
in the room, even Johnson, are largely supportive of aiding Ukraine but
have stressed to the White House that it will need significant
border-security measures in return to persuade the large swath of
rank-and-file Republican lawmakers skeptical about sending more funds
abroad.</p>
<p>“He’s willing to hear what these congressional members want to talk
about, but the purpose of this meeting is to talk about Ukraine,” White
House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said ahead of the mid-afternoon
gathering, which was held in the Cabinet Room.</p>
<p>Key time to convene</p>
<p>Biden is convening the lawmakers at the start of an election year
when border security and the wars abroad are punctuating the race for
the White House as he faces a potential rematch against Republican
Donald Trump with control of the presidency and Congress all at
stake.</p>
<p>It comes as Congress is about to quickly approve temporary funding to
avoid a government shutdown — postponing the annual spending battles —
but as the supplemental aid package sits undone during the immigration
and border talks.</p>
<p>Biden, a longtime leader in U.S. foreign policy, finds himself
confronting a new generation of Republican lawmakers who have little
interest in engaging abroad or supporting vast American military aid or
actions around the world.</p>
<p>Led by Trump, the former president who is the Republicans’
front-runner for the nomination, a growing number of the Republicans in
Congress are particularly hostile to helping Ukraine fight Russian
President Vladimir Putin’s invasion.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who along with National
Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met this week with Ukrainian President
Zelenskyy in Davos, Switzerland, said Washington is determined to keep
supporting Ukraine, and “we’re working very closely with Congress in
order to do that.”</p>
<p>Ahead of the meeting, McConnell announced the package could be ready
for a vote as soon as next week, and Schumer sounded a similarly
optimistic note — though negotiations continue.</p>
<p>Senators develop border proposal</p>
<p>Johnson, since taking the gavel in October, signaled he personally
believes in supporting Ukraine as it works to expel Russia. He met
privately with Zelenskyy during the Ukrainian president’s whirlwind tour
of Washington last month seeking aid before the year-end holidays.</p>
<p>But the speaker leads an ambivalent House Republican majority that
wants to extract its own priorities on the U.S.-Mexico border in
exchange for any overseas support.</p>
<p>The speaker has insisted any border security deal must align with the
House-passed strict border security bill. He told lawmakers in a private
meeting over the weekend that they could probably get their priorities
enacted with a Republican president, though the speaker did not mean
that to preclude not taking action now, said a Republican leadership
aide familiar with the call.</p>
<p>But senators, even fellow Republicans, said the House approach is a
nonstarter that would never find the bipartisan backing in both chambers
needed for approval.</p>
<p>Instead, a core group of senators led by Republican James Lankford
has been meeting privately for weeks with Biden’s top advisers —
including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas — to develop a
border security package that could actually be signed into law.</p>
<p>Lankford told reporters late Tuesday that he hopes to prepare bill
text as negotiations try to wrap up soon.</p>
<p>McConnell told Republican senators privately last week they should
take the deal Lankford is producing, according to a person granted
anonymity to discuss the closed meeting.</p>
<p>“This is a unique moment in time,” said the Number 2 Republican John
Thune.</p>
<p>“It’s an opportunity to get some really conservative border policy
that we haven’t been able to get for 40 years,” he said. “And so we’ll
see. I mean, it may or may not happen, but I think you got to take a run
at it.”</p>
<p>Senator ‘hopeful’</p>
<p>The broader security package includes about $60 billion for Ukraine,
which is mainly used to purchase U.S. weaponry to fight the war and to
shore up its own government operations, along with some $14.5 billion
for Israel, about $14 billion for border security, and additional funds
for other security needs.</p>
<p>Biden opened the door to a broader U.S.-Mexico border security
package late last year and the changes being discussed could be
difficult for some Democrats who oppose strict restrictions on
immigration.</p>
<p>Schumer said negotiations over the border security package have made
progress in recent weeks and he was “hopeful that things are headed in
the right direction.”</p>
<p>Schumer said he expects the meeting with Biden will reinforce that
the national security package is urgent and “any agreement on an issue
as complex and contentious as the border is going to have to have
support from both sides of the aisle.”</p>

<h2 id="do-users-write-more-insecure-code-with-ai-assistants">Do users
write more insecure code with AI assistants?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>AI code assistants have emerged as powerful tools that can aid in the
software development life-cycle and can improve developer productivity.
Unfortunately, such assistants have also been found to produce insecure
code in lab environments, raising significant concerns about their usage
in practice. In this paper, we conduct a user study to examine how users
interact with AI code assistants to solve a variety of security related
tasks. Overall, we find that participants who had access to an AI
assistant wrote significantly less secure code than those without access
to an assistant. Participants with access to an AI assistant were also
more likely to believe they wrote secure code, suggesting that such
tools may lead users to be overconfident about security flaws in their
code. To better inform the design of future AI-based code assistants, we
release our user-study apparatus and anonymized data to researchers
seeking to build on our work at this link. ↫ Neil Perry, Megha
Srivastava, Deepak Kumar, and Dan Boneh I’m surprised somewhat randomly
copying other people’s code into your program – violating their
licenses, to boot – leads to crappier code. Who knew!</p>

<h2 id="from-0-to-1-mb-in-dos">From 0 to 1 MB in DOS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>Since the last article on the text-based IDEs of old, I’ve been
meaning to write about the GCC port to DOS, namely DJGPP. As I worked on
the draft for that topic, I realized that there is a ton of ground to
cover to set the stage so I took most of the content on memory
management out and wrote this separate post. This article is a deep dive
on how DOS had to pull out tricks maximize the use of the very limited 1
MB address space of the 8086. Those tricks could exist because of the
features later introduced by the 80286 and the 80386, but these were
just clutches to paper over the fact that DOS could not leverage the
real improvements provided by protected mode. ↫ Julio Merino The DOS
memory story is a string of hacks upon hacks that somehow managed to
work – and that still work today.</p>

<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTA2MTcyOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0Mzc0OTY1OX0.FrJrxrrrzA6_bEyGbDaKYgvQTm_-3qqF39ZLx_xZcuc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
America’s electric car market has a new champion. The automaking
alliance of Hyundai Motor Group and Kia Motors is now the second biggest
seller of electric cars in the United States, according to
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@corey_cantor/post/C17q3GRR2r7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new
data released last week</a> by Bloomberg BNEF.
</p>
<p>
The two companies sold more than 117,000 electric vehicles in the United
States last year, or about 8% of all new EVs nationwide, according to
the research firm. Only Tesla, the industry’s longtime leader, sold more
electric cars: It still commands about half of U.S. market share.
</p>
<p>
The two companies’ success is an encouraging sign in what was more
broadly a weird year for the EV market. Scarcely more than a year ago,
the public’s demand for electric cars
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-ev-sales-jolted-higher-in-2022-as-newcomers-target-tesla-11672981834" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">overwhelmed
available inventory</a>, and dealers were selling every EV they could
get their hands on.
</p>
<p>
But as gas prices have fallen, the growth in EV sales in the United
States
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/electric-vehicle-demand-charts-7d3089c7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has
slowed</a>, and the market has gotten more uneven. Tesla, looking to
shore up its market position,
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/14/23554886/tesla-price-cut-ev-market-deman-elon-musk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">launched</a>
a price war last year that juiced sales but cut deep into its profits.
Ford and General Motors, meanwhile, are suffering
<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/11/02/ford-slows-mustang-mach-e-ev-production-sales-slip-october/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">anemic</a>
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/11/23997632/ford-f150-lightning-production-reduce-ev-demand" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sales</a>
and
<a href="https://www.automotivedive.com/news/gm-evs-abandons-plan-build-400000-mid-2024/697670/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cutting
</a><a href="https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/renewable/ford-cuts-planned-f-150-ev-production-in-half/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">back</a>
on their short-term EV plans.
</p>
<p>
Amid this patchy landscape, Hyundai and Kia’s growth stands out. While
the two companies are technically independent, Hyundai owns about a
third of Kia Motors, and they collaborate on vehicle design,
engineering, and manufacturing. They also use the same vehicle
“platforms,” a common set of parts that can be used across models.
</p>
<p>
Since the news came out last week, I’ve seen climate people on Twitter
and elsewhere try to explain why it’s happening. Many of these
explanations conform to the views that the urban, progressive climate
commentariat already hold about the car market. <em>Look, Hyundai and
Kia are winning because they’re making smaller cars, not behemoth SUVs.
</em>
</p>
<p>
But the answer, while not quite the opposite, doesn’t line up with what
many might wish. In fact, Hyundai and Kia are dominating the EV market
right now by churning out a mostly unbroken stream of crossover and
SUVs. All but one of their electric cars qualifies as an SUV or
crossover; all of their plug-in hybrids are SUVs. It is this commitment
to repetition — to giving the consumer a lot of choices on a central
theme — that sets their product lines apart right now.
</p>
<p>
You can see the importance of this by looking at their models in more
depth. Take the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and the Kia EV6, for instance, which
have led EV sales at the two brands and which are
<a href="https://www.topspeed.com/the-real-differences-between-the-kia-ev6-and-hyundai-ioniq-5/#:~:text=Both%20the%20EV6%20and%20the,fastest%2Dcharging%20EVs%20currently%20available." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">built
on the same platform</a>. Each is an electrified take on the type of car
that, for years now,
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/how-the-crossover-conquered-americas-automobile-market/374061/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Americans
haven’t been able to get enough of</a>: the compact crossover SUV. The
Ioniq 5 and EV6 each have two rows of seating and 25 cubic feet of trunk
space. They drive more or less like a car, sit high on the road like an
SUV, and fall in the broad category of cars that — as a friend’s wife
puts it — looks
<a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a36715409/why-does-every-new-car-look-like-every-other-new-car/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">like
a fist with its thumb stuck out</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Ioniq 5 and EV6 are also really, really similar to the Mustang Mach
E, Ford’s attempt at an electric crossover. In fact, if you look
<em>only</em> at specs, they’re basically the same car. All three have
the same length and width and take up about 95 square feet of road
space. All three have five seats. All three have roughly the same size
trunk, although the Ford’s is maybe slightly bigger. And all three have
an entry-level model starting at about $42,000 — although the lowest
trim Ford has slightly more range and horsepower, and costs about a
grand more.
</p>
<p>
As you might expect from those specs, the Mach E narrowly outsold the
Ioniq 5 and EV6 in the United States last year. Ford sold more than
40,000 Mach Es in 2023, while Hyundai moved nearly 34,000 Ioniq 5s and
Kia sold 19,000 EV6s. But here’s the thing: The Mach E did not outsell
the Ioniq 5 and EV6 <em>combined. </em>And unlike Ford, which only sells
one electric SUV, Hyundai and Kia continued to flood the zone with SUV
options for consumers.
</p>
<p>
How many options? Hyundai sold
<a href="https://www.hyundaiusa.com/us/en/electrified/plug-in-hybrids" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plug-in
versions</a> of its Tuscon and Santa Fe SUVs. Kia sold an electric
version of its subcompact Niro SUV and a plug-in hybrid version of its
Sportage SUV. And even though Kia only
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/698888/kia-ev9-ev6-sales-us-november2023/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">started
selling</a> its new three-row SUV, the EV9, in December, it had already
delivered more than 1,000 of them by the end of the year.
</p>
<p>
In fact, only <em>one</em> electric car from Hyundai-Kia — the new Ioniq
6 — was designed like a traditional sedan. But it made up only around 8%
of the alliance’s total sales. Hyundai and Kia achieved their commanding
position by giving Americans what they want: a seemingly endless stream
of SUVs and crossovers.
</p>
<p>
Now, it matters here that Kia and Hyundai are two different companies,
so there is some automatic duplication in their product lines. It might
never make sense for Ford or GM to sell cars as similar as the EV6 and
Ioniq 5. But if we’re being honest, their SUV lineups are already
<a href="https://www.ford.com/new-suvs-crossovers/?gclid=CjwKCAiAkp6tBhB5EiwANTCx1G_ek-lL-QZt-HolZn3jRnrEDpHUTqA0dzl22f6i4FEY8mXRXWIrWRoCnu8QAvD_BwE&searchid=20393971331%7C150008182965%7C297751469959%7C&ef_id=CjwKCAiAkp6tBhB5EiwANTCx1G_ek-lL-QZt-HolZn3jRnrEDpHUTqA0dzl22f6i4FEY8mXRXWIrWRoCnu8QAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!2519!3!666661326138!b!!g!!ford%20suv%20lineup&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>pretty</em>
duplicative</a>: Do most consumers understand the difference between a
Ford Edge and a Ford Escape? There’s no reason Ford couldn’t add an
Escape EV to its lineup — something a little smaller and a little
cheaper. That’s exactly what Kia does with the EV Niro, after all.
</p>
<p>
It helps, too, that lots of Kia and Hyundai’s cars look like great deals
for consumers. Many of their key offerings hover in the high $30,000s to
mid $40,000s, seemingly the sweet spot for new family cars today. Even
though Hyundai and Kia’s cars
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/ev-tax-credit-new-2024" target="_self">don’t
qualify for the new EV tax credit</a>, Americans can use the $7,500
federal tax credit if they lease a vehicle instead.
</p>
<p>
Hyundai especially has used this credit — and a creative mix of
<a href="https://www.carsdirect.com/deals-articles/2024-hyundai-ioniq-6-rebate-undercuts-model-3-highland-by-9-000" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rebates
and low-interest-rate offers</a> — to bring down the monthly payment for
consumers. (Nearly half of new Ioniq 5s are leased, according to BNEF,
which is a much higher rate than normal for Hyundai’s cars.)
</p>
<p>
Finally, it helps that Kia and <em>especially </em>Hyundai are making
more interesting-looking vehicles than any other automaker right now.
Compared to the staid peoplemover that is, say,
<a href="https://www.vw.com/en/models/id-4.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
Volkswagen ID.4</a>, the Ioniq 5 is striking, novel, and seems to push
EV design forward.
<a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/44928/hyundais-design-strategy-for-ioniq-is-pixelated" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Its
pixelated taillights</a> are unlike anything else on the road, and it’s
an extremely charismatic vehicle to drive; it’s just a better
<em>product, </em>overall, than other cars out there.
</p>
<p>
And that might be the most important lesson behind Hyundai and Kia’s
success. For the past few decades, decarbonization advocates have gotten
used to thinking about electric cars primarily as a market abstraction:
Are they cheap? Are they available? Are they growing as a sector? But as
the EV transition continues, we are going to have to think about them
more as <em>products</em>, as specific tools that can improve someone’s
life by their presence. The EV companies that ultimately win will make
better products than their competitors — cars that bring together
capability, design, and price in a special way. Right now, Hyundai and
Kia are pushing to the front of that race.<br/>

<h2
id="the-south-is-smashing-electricity-records-in-the-dead-of-winter">The
South Is Smashing Electricity Records in the Dead of Winter</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTEwODExMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0ODUwNDI2Nn0.y-Mf5zPCBe1_NnKhEBFH7sg37IFvTGAUklGDKEN7mjI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
America’s largest public power company just set a new record. The
Tennessee Valley Authority said consumers used around 34,500 megawatts
of electricity on Wednesday morning, about 1,000 megawatts more than its
previous all-time record of around 33,500 megawatts in August 2007.
</p>
<p>
While the cold weather across much of the country has strained many
power grids, especially those in the South where electric heating is
more common, it’s noteworthy that TVA not only broke its winter record,
but it’s all-time record as well. By contrast, the market that covers
90% of Texas, ERCOT,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/texas-grid-demand-cold-mornings" target="_blank">set
a winter demand record earlier this week</a>, but its overall record is
still from this past summer.
</p>
<p>
Much of the area around the Tennessee Valley served by the Authority
have seen persistent low temperatures over the past few days. Nashville
has a forecast high of 30 degrees Wednesday and has gotten as cold as -1
degree Fahrenheit, only the second time the city has experienced
below-zero temperatures since
1996,<a href="https://twitter.com/NWSNashville/status/1747576400826318958?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
according to the National Weather Service</a>.<br/><br/>And cold
temperatures mean more electricity usage. Like much of the region,
Tennesseans
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=TN" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">largely
heat their homes using electricity</a> as opposed to fuel oil or natural
gas.<br/><br/>“Heavy snow and bitter cold temperatures are creating
record high demand for electricity across the Southeast region,” the TVA
said in a warning released Tuesday, asking its customers to reduce their
electricity consumption from 6 am to 10 am. Similar warnings were issued
by ERCOT, which also serves millions of households who heat their homes
via electricity. The cold snap
is<a href="https://www.tva.com/newsroom/articles/cold-snap-arrives" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
expected to last through the weekend</a>.
</p>
<p>
And like in Texas, the amount of power TVA is called upon to provide has
grown as the region it serves has seen its population and economy grow.
</p>
<p>
While TVA has a
<a href="https://www.tva.com/energy/our-power-system/renewables" target="_blank">relatively
modest solar portfolio</a> compared to the large and growing amounts of
wind and solar in Texas, the TVA can still struggle with cold mornings.
Some of this is due to what solar power it does have not being
available, but it’s largely because of the nature of electricity demand
in the winter. On cold days, it is especially chilly in the morning,
when people are trying to heat their homes between waking up and going
to work or school. By contrast, summer afternoons and early evenings are
tough for grids to manage because temperatures stay high even as the sun
goes down and people return to their homes and cool them and start
operating appliances. <br/>
</p>
<p>
TVA’s generation mix is almost unique within the United States in that
much of it is non-carbon-emitting but with relatively little wind or
solar. About 60% of its power comes from carbon-free sources, which are
nearly entirely its three nuclear plants and its iconic dams.

<h2 id="google-introduces-google-takeout-api">Google introduces Google
Takeout API</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>Google has detailed more of the changes it’s implementing to comply
with the European Union’s Digital Markets Act. We already covered the
changes to linked services, but Google is also changing how results
related to shopping and booking results are displayed. We will introduce
dedicated units that include a group of links to comparison sites from
across the web, and query shortcuts at the top of the search page to
help people refine their search, including by focusing results just on
comparison sites. For categories like hotels, we will also start testing
a dedicated space for comparison sites and direct suppliers to show more
detailed individual results including images, star ratings and more.
These changes will result in the removal of some features from the
search page, such as the Google Flights unit. ↫ Oliver Bethell Google is
also releasing its promised Google Takeout API, allowing developers to
programmatically deal with users wanting to take their data out of
Google to another service. This one in particular I’m interested in,
since I’m curious if, say, a competing email service will make it easier
and automatic to move away from Gmail.</p>

Court Puts Trump Ballot Decision on Hold Until After US Supreme Court
Acts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A Maine court on Wednesday ordered the state’s top
election official to reevaluate a decision to bar former President
Donald Trump from the Republican primary ballot after the U.S. Supreme
Court rules on a related case from Colorado. </p>
<p>State Superior Court Judge Michaela Murphy found that the Supreme
Court’s decision to take the Colorado case “changes everything about the
order in which these issues should be decided and by which court.” </p>
<p>The judge ordered Maine Secretary of State Shanna Bellows, a
Democrat, to reassess her decision to bar Trump from the ballot within
30 days after the Supreme Court rules. </p>
<p>In December, Bellows determined that Trump, the frontrunner for the
2024 Republican presidential nomination, was ineligible to hold office
again under a provision in the U.S. Constitution that bars people who
have engaged in insurrection or rebellion from holding office. </p>
<p>Depending on the sweep of its ruling in the Colorado case, the U.S.
Supreme Court could resolve the issue nationwide in the coming weeks,
with oral arguments scheduled for February 8. </p>
<p>Maine and Colorado are so far the only two states to disqualify Trump
under the constitutional provision, known as Section 3 of the 14th
Amendment. Both states have put their decisions on hold while Trump
appeals. </p>
<p>Courts and election officials in several other states have rejected
similar ballot challenges to Trump’s candidacy.</p>

Lawmakers Push for Limits on American Investment in China Tech</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Capitol Hill — U.S. lawmakers renewed calls Wednesday to pass
bipartisan legislation that would restrict American investment in
Chinese technology.</p>
<p>“It should come as no surprise that China’s military and surveillance
state are exploiting loopholes in U.S. policy to access billions of U.S.
investment dollars and expertise. We know that U.S. investment has not
democratized China and countries which are controlled by the CCP
[Chinese Communist Party] have no power over the applications of their
technology. The CCP can direct it to us for military or surveillance
purposes,” House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul said
at a hearing on the legislation Wednesday. </p>
<p>The bill – which has support from both conservative organizations and
the Biden administration – was not included in the National Defense
Authorization Act or NDAA passed late last year. Republican Senator John
Cornyn has sponsored companion legislation in the U.S. Senate that
passed with more than ninety votes. </p>
<p>Lawmakers hope it can still be passed individually and signed into
law.  </p>
<p>If passed, McCaul said the measure, H.R. 6349, would target “specific
technology sectors, like AI [artificial intelligence] and quantum
computing, that are empowering China’s military development and
surveillance.” </p>
<p>Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, said an executive order issued by the Biden administration
last August “that calls for provisions and notification requirements of
specific types of American investments in China, or in certain companies
that develop or produce semiconductors, quantum computers, and
artificial intelligence applications” is an important first step. </p>
<p>But experts in U.S.-China relations told a House panel more could be
done. </p>
<p>“Congress has an opportunity to build on the initial steps taken by
the Trump and Biden administrations to prevent U.S. capital from fueling
China’s military and intelligence capabilities. First, Washington should
take a sectoral rather than merely an entity-based approach. The
Treasury Department has demonstrated since at least 2021 that it is
disinterested in using even its existing narrow authorities to limit
investment in Chinese military-linked companies. And in fairness to the
Treasury Department tackling the problem on a company-by-company basis
would be a resource-intensive and gargantuan task,” Matthew Pottinger,
the deputy national security adviser during the Trump administration,
said Wednesday. </p>
<p>“We still haven’t learned that they will do everything they can to
take anything we sell, particularly in the area of electronics and
really high tech, and use it for the military. They’ve been doing that
for decades. We don’t learn. We think somehow if you trade more, they’ll
matriculate from dictatorship to democracy,” Republican Rep. Chris Smith
said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The bipartisan push in the U.S. House comes as Senate negotiators
continue work on the White House’s $106 billion national security
supplemental request that includes funding to combat Chinese influence
in the Indo-Pacific. Citing a border security crisis, Senate Republicans
have sought changes to U.S. immigration law in return for their votes to
pass more than $50 billion in assistance to Ukraine that is also part of
the Biden administration’s request. </p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell urged lawmakers Wednesday to
reach an agreement soon. </p>
<p>“It’s become quite fashionable in Washington to talk about how we’re
not taking competition with China seriously enough,” McConnell said.
“Winning this competition means credibly deterring Beijing’s worst
impulses, which, for us, means investing in American strength.
Outcompeting the PRC [People’s Republic of China] will require greater
investments in our military capabilities and in our industrial capacity
to produce them. The West cannot be caught unprepared for this
challenge. We cannot afford to neglect the lessons of history.”</p>

<h2 id="corporations-are-not-to-be-loved">Corporations Are Not To Be
Loved</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: Innessential (Brint Simmons’ blog)</p>
<p>
I started using Apple computers — and writing code for them, starting
with BASIC — 43 years ago, before the Macintosh, even, and I’ve made
this my career. I’ve had all these decades to really, thoroughly delight
in these incredible machines and software, and to give a little back
with my own apps.
</p>
<p>
Apple’s positive effect on my life should not be underestimated. My Mom
once (lovingly, teasingly) said to me that my alternate career, had all
this never happened, was “criminal genius.” Which might have been fun
too, but possibly more stressful than I might have liked. At any rate,
Apple has saved me from a life of crime, and I should love Apple for
that.
</p>
<p>
But I need to remember, now and again, that Apple is a corporation, and
corporations aren’t people, and they can’t love you back. You wouldn’t
love GE or Exxon or Comcast — and you shouldn’t love Apple. It’s not an
exception to the rule: there are no exceptions.
</p>
<p>
Apple doesn’t care about you personally in the least tiny bit, and if
you were in their way somehow, they would do whatever their might —
effectively infinite compared to your own — enables them to deal with
you.
</p>
<p>
Luckily, Apple has just provided us all with a reminder. Just like the
sixth finger in an AI-rendered hand, Apple’s policies for
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement-us/">Distributing
apps in the U.S. that provide an external purchase link</a> are
startlingly graceless and a jarring, but not surprising, reminder that
Apple is not a real person and not worthy of your love.

id="judge-threatens-trump-with-expulsion-from-defamation-trial">Judge
Threatens Trump With Expulsion From Defamation Trial</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — A federal judge in New York on Wednesday threatened to
expel former U.S. President Donald Trump from a civil trial after he
repeatedly made side comments disparaging the testimony of his accuser,
writer E. Jean Carroll. </p>
<p>Carroll is seeking damages from Trump, whom she accuses of defaming
her after she accused him of sexually abusing her decades ago. </p>
<p>Judge Lewis Kaplan told Trump that his right to be at the trial would
be revoked if he continued to ignore warnings to keep his comments to
his lawyers quieter and out of earshot of the nine-member jury. </p>
<p>But after an initial warning, Carroll’s lawyer said Trump could still
be heard making remarks to his lawyers, including “it is a witch hunt”
and “it really is a con job.” </p>
<p>Kaplan, after excusing the jury for lunch, said, “Mr. Trump, I hope I
don’t have to consider excluding you from the trial. I understand you’re
probably eager for me to do that.” </p>
<p>“I would love it,” Trump shot back, shrugging as he sat between
lawyers Alina Habba and Michael Madaio at the defense table. </p>
<p>“I know you would like it. You just can’t control yourself in this
circumstance, apparently,” Kaplan responded. </p>
<p>“You can’t either,” Trump muttered. </p>
<p>The exchange came after Carroll lawyer Shawn Crowley complained for a
second time that Trump could be heard “loudly saying things that are
false” as he sat at the defense table.</p>
<p>Kaplan said, “I’m just going to ask that Mr. Trump take special care
to keep his voice down when conferring with counsel to make sure the
jury does not hear it.” </p>
<p>The jury was seated less than 4 meters from where Trump was
sitting. </p>
<p>Trump was particularly incensed that Kaplan refused to call off the
proceedings on Thursday so Trump could attend his mother-in-law’s
funeral in Florida and not miss any of the courtroom testimony. </p>
<p>Before Carroll resumed her testimony after lunch, Trump’s lawyers
asked for Kaplan to recuse himself from the case because of “general
hostility” toward the former president. </p>
<p>“Denied,” Kaplan said in a one-word response. </p>
<p>Carroll, now 80, has alleged that Trump decades ago sexually
assaulted her in a dressing room at the Bergdorf-Goodman department
store and then defamed her by denying the attack occurred and saying
that he did not know who she was. Carroll was a long-time advice
columnist for Elle magazine at the time of the alleged assault. </p>
<p>A New York jury last year awarded Carroll $5 million in ruling that
Trump sexually abused her and that he defamed Carroll in 2022 comments
he made while denying the attack occurred and saying that she was “not
my type.” </p>
<p>Carroll testified, “It means I’m too ugly to assault.” </p>
<p>An excerpt of Trump’s October 2022 deposition released by U.S.
District Court for Southern New York included an exchange wherein Trump
mistook a photo of Carroll for his ex-wife, Marla Maples. </p>
<p>In the current case, Kaplan has ruled that the facts of the alleged
attack are already established by the earlier verdict and that the
jury’s only decision is whether to award further damages, $10 million or
more, because of 2019 remarks Trump made about Carroll while he was
president. </p>
<p>As Trump watched from the defense table Wednesday, Carroll told the
jurors, “I’m here because Donald Trump assaulted me and when I wrote
about it, he said it never happened. He lied and shattered my
reputation.” </p>
<p>Once, Carroll testified, she was a respected advice columnist. “Now,
I’m known as the liar, the fraud and the whack job.” </p>
<p>Trump has made repeated disparaging comments about Carroll on his
Truth Social platform in recent days leading up the trial. </p>
<p>Carroll testified, “He has continued to lie. He lied last month. He
lied on Sunday. He lied yesterday.” </p>
<p>While attending the trial in New York, Trump, the leading Republican
candidate in the 2024 presidential campaign, has shuttled back and forth
between the courtroom and campaign appearances in the northeastern state
of New Hampshire, where the first U.S. party primary election is set for
next Tuesday.</p>

<h2 id="us-redesignates-yemens-houthis-as-major-terror-group">US
Redesignates Yemen’s Houthis as Major Terror Group</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States is cracking down on Yemen’s Houthi
rebels, redesignating them as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist
group following weeks of missile and drone attacks on international
shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.</p>
<p>The move came nearly three years after the Houthis were first
designated as a terror group and then subsequently delisted because of
humanitarian concerns, and it followed repeated demands from the U.S.
and other countries for the Houthis to stop firing on commercial
shipping.</p>
<p>But the demands have been ignored, and attacks have continued despite
a series of airstrikes by the U.S. and Britain, aimed at taking out
radar systems and launch sites used in the attacks.</p>
<p>“We cannot sit idly by and watch what the Houthis are doing in the
Red Sea and not recognize their actions for what they are,” a senior
U.S. administration official told reporters, briefing the condition of
anonymity ahead of the official announcement.</p>
<p>“These attacks fit the textbook definition of terrorism,” a second
official said, likewise speaking on the condition of anonymity. “They
have endangered U.S. personnel, civilian mariners and our partners,
jeopardized global trade and threatened freedom of navigation.”</p>
<p>U.S. officials point to about 30 attacks from Houthi-controlled areas
of Yemen since mid-November, impacting citizens, cargo and vessels from
more than 50 countries.</p>
<p>Officials have also said that since the attacks started, some 2,000
ships have been diverted thousands of miles to avoid the Red Sea.
Additionally, Houthi militants have threatened or taken hostage mariners
from more than 20 countries.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the U.S. for the first time carried out a series of
preemptive strikes, destroying four Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles
before they could be launched.</p>
<p>That followed two waves of U.S. and British strikes last week against
more than 60 targets in 16 locations across Houthi-controlled Yemen.</p>
<p>Houthi officials Wednesday described the U.S. designation as an
attempt at “blackmail.”</p>
<p>“Whoever fails with aggression will certainly fail with a decision
[of designation],” Houthi media official Abdul-Rahman Al-Ahnumi said in
an interview with Reuters.</p>
<p>“The decision came at this time after Britain and America launched a
military aggression against Yemen and failed to achieve the same goal,
which is to dissuade Yemen from its position,” Al-Ahnumi said. “It is
also an attempt to dissuade Yemen from its position supporting Palestine
and Gaza.”</p>
<p>But in separate statements Wednesday, White House national security
adviser Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the
Houthi attacks “unprecedented.”</p>
<p>“This designation is an important tool to impede terrorist funding to
the Houthis, further restrict their access to financial markets,”
Sullivan said.</p>
<p>“The Houthis must be held accountable for their actions,” Blinken
said.</p>
<p>Several U.S. officials, though, left open the possibility the
designation could be revoked if the attacks cease.</p>
<p>“The ultimate goal of sanctions is to convince the Houthis to
de-escalate and bring about a positive change in behavior,” one of the
senior administration officials who briefed on the condition of
anonymity told reporters. “If the Houthis cease their attacks, we can
consider delisting designation.”</p>
<p>But the official added the U.S. is taking steps to ensure that the
designation does not harm efforts to help Yemen’s civilian population,
where the United Nations estimates 24 million people are at risk of
starvation.</p>
<p>The re-designation of the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global
Terrorist group will not go into effect for 30 days, “to allow us to
ensure robust humanitarian carve-outs are in place,” the official
said.</p>
<p>The official also said commercial shipments to Yemen of for food,
medicine and fuel would not be affected by the sanctions.</p>
<p>The designation, however, will block the ability of the Houthis to
access the U.S. financial system and paves the way for other sanctions
and law enforcement actions against the group.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said the ability to ensure to continuation of
humanitarian aid played a role in the decision to label the Houthis with
the SDGT designation.</p>
<p>They said designating the Houthis with the harsher Foreign Terrorist
Organization, or FTO, label would require additional sanctions that
could ensnare aid organizations trying to provide relief for Yemen’s
civilians.</p>
<p>“We found in our conversations with groups that are providing
humanitarian aid in Yemen that an FTO designation ran the risk of having
a deterrent effect on some of those aid groups continuing to provide
aid, worried that they might be charged as providing material support to
a terrorist organization,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller
told reporters during a briefing on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“So, when weighing those options, we decided that the SDGT
designation gave us the tools to deny the Houthis access to the
financial system, and gave us the tools to impose additional actions,
additional sanctions, on anyone who does business with the Houthis,
while minimizing some of the downstream harm to Yemeni civilians,” he
said.</p>
<p>Some aid groups, though, have already raised concerns that the SDGT
designation will hurt more than it helps.</p>
<p>“Even with carve-outs, there is likely to be a serious chilling
effect,” the International Rescue Committee’s Anastasia Moran said in a
statement. “We are concerned some private sector actors, including food
importers and banks facilitating transactions for humanitarian
organizations, may choose to disengage altogether.”</p>
<p>In contrast, some U.S. lawmakers are warning the SDGT designation
does not go far enough.</p>
<p>“Designating the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist
only applies sanctions and avoids taking any real action,” House
Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner said in a statement. “It’s
time to lead and protect and call them what they are — a Foreign
Terrorist Organization.”</p>
<p>Elisabeth Kendall, a Yemen specialist at the University of Cambridge
in Britain, cautioned that regardless of the type of terrorist
designation, the impact on the Houthis was likely to be minimal.</p>
<p>“Houthi hardliners and leaders will see this as a badge of honor and
continue business as usual,” she told VOA via email.</p>
<p>“They will not be the ones to suffer,” she added. “The war economy is
booming and has enriched many powerful figures. The smuggling trade may
even prove more lucrative following the designation.”</p>
<p>There are also questions about how the new designation will affect
countries like Iran that have been supplying the Houthis.</p>
<p>“They [Houthis] currently use IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guard
Corps] funding, training and weapons to destabilize Yemen and engage in
terrorist activities or terrorism that affects the region,” said a third
senior administration official in response to a question from VOA.</p>
<p>“So, we will continue to also counter Iranian malign influence
wherever we can,” the official said. “Of course, the choice to move away
from Iran is now in the hands of the Houthis.”</p>
<p>The U.S. first designated the Houthis, also known as Ansarallah, as
both an SDGT and a FTO during the last days of President Donald Trump’s
administration in January 2021.</p>
<p>According to a statement by then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the
move was intended “to hold Ansarallah accountable for its terrorist
acts, including cross-border attacks threatening civilian populations,
infrastructure and commercial shipping.”</p>
<p>But the designation was revoked about a month later under current
U.S. President Joe Biden, with officials citing the need to get
humanitarian aid into Yemen to prevent a possible famine.</p>
<p>“This decision is a recognition of the dire humanitarian situation in
Yemen,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at the time. “By focusing
on alleviating the humanitarian situation in Yemen, we hope the Yemeni
parties can also focus on engaging in dialogue.”</p>
<p>The White House on Wednesday defended its decision to remove the
terror designation for the Houthis, despite the need to redesignate them
now.</p>
<p>“A big reason why we delisted them literally on day one was to
address a dire, dire humanitarian situation on the ground,” National
Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.</p>
<p>The Pentagon on Wednesday said the decision to designate the Houthis
would not affect military operations in the region.</p>
<p>White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara contributed to this
report. Some information came from Reuters and The Associated Press.</p>

were open tables in one form or another.

<p>ChatGPT is like having a programming partner you can try ideas out
on, or ask for alternative approaches, and they’re always there, and not
too busy to help out. They know everything you don’t know and need to
know, and rarely hallucinate (you have to check the work, same as with a
human btw). It’s remarkable how much it is like having an ideal human
programming partner. It’s the kind of helper I aspire to be.</p>

id="pluralistic-the-super-rich-got-that-way-through-monopolies-17-jan-2024">Pluralistic:
The super-rich got that way through monopolies (17 Jan 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links The super-rich got that way through monopolies: A
report in honor of Davos. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This
day in history: 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications,
upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading
The super-rich got that way through monopolies (permalink) Just in time
for Davos, here’s ‘Taken, not earned: How monopolists drive the world’s
power and wealth divide,” a report from a coalition of international tax
justice and anti-corporate activist groups:
https://www.balancedeconomy.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Davos-Taken-not-Earned-full-Report-2024-FINAL.pdf
Everyone – even the World Economic Forum – says that wealth inequality
is a serious problem, corroding our politics and our social cohesion.
What this report does is link that inequality to monopolies, which
produce the billionaires who are wrecking the world. The rise of
monopolies over the past 40 years came about as the result of specific,
deliberate policy choices. As the report documents, the wealthiest
people in America funneled a fortune into neutering antitrust
enforcement, through the “consumer welfare” doctrine. This is an
economic theory that equates monopolies with efficiency: “If everyone is
buying the same things from the same store, that tells you the store is
doing something right, not something criminal.” 40 years ago, and ever
since, the wealthy have funded think-tanks, university programs and even
“continuing education” programs for federal judges to push this line:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/13/post-bork-era/#manne-down They didn’t
do this for ideological reasons – they were chasing material goals.
Monopolies produce vast profits, and those profits produce vast wealth.
The rise and rise of the super rich cannot be decoupled from the rise
and rise of monopolies. If you’re new to this, you might think that
“monopoly” only refers to a sector in which there is only one seller.
But that’s not what economists mean when they talk about monopolies and
monopolization: for them, a monopoly is a company with power. Economists
who talk about monopolies mean companies that “can act independently
without needing to consider the responses of competitors, customers,
workers, or even governments.” One way to measure that power is through
markups (“the difference between the selling price of goods or services
and their cost”). Very large companies in concentrated industries have
very high markups, and they’re getting higher. From 2017-22, the 20
largest companies in the world had average markups of 50%. The 100
largest companies average 43%. The smallest half of companies get
average markups of 25%. Those markups rose steeply during the covid
lockdowns – and so did the wealth of the billionaires who own them. Tech
billionaires – Bezos, Brin and Page, Gates and Ballmer – all made their
fortunes from monopolies. Warren Buffet is a proud monopolist who says
“the single most important decision in evaluating a business is pricing
power… if you have to have a prayer session before raising the price by
10 percent, then you’ve got a terrible business.” We are living in the
age of the monopoly. In the 1930s, the top 0.1% of US companies
accounted for less than half of America’s GDP. Today, it’s 90%. And it’s
accelerating, with global mergers climbing from 2,676 in 1985 to 62,000
in 2021. Monopoly’s cheerleaders claim that these numbers vindicate
them. Monopolies are so efficient that everyone wants to create them.
Those efficiencies can be seen in the markups monopolies can charge, and
the profits they can make. If a monopoly has a 50% markup, that’s just
the “efficiency of scale.” But what is the actual shape of this
“efficiency?” How is it manifest? The report’s authors answer this with
one word: power. Monopolists have the power “to extract wealth from, to
restrict the freedoms of, and to manipulate or steer the vastly larger
numbers of losers.” They establish themselves as gatekeepers and create
chokepoints that they can use to raise prices paid by their customers
and lower the payout to their suppliers:
https://chokepointcapitalism.com/ These chokepoints let monopolies usurp
“one of the ultimate prerogatives of state power: taxation.” Amazon
sellers pay a 51% tax to sell on the platform. App Store suppliers pay a
30% tax on every dollar they make with their apps. That translates into
higher costs. Consider a good that costs $10 to make: the bottom 50% of
companies (by size) would charge $12.50 for that product on average. The
largest companies would charge $15. Thus monopolies don’t just make
their owners richer – they make everyone else poorer, too. This power to
set prices is behind the greedflation (or, more politely, “seller’s
inflation”). The CEOs of the largest companies in the world keep getting
on investor calls and bragging about this:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/11/price-over-volume/#pepsi-pricing-power
The food system is incredibly monopolistic. The Cargill family own the
largest commodity trader in the world, which is how they built up a
family fortune worth $43b. Cargill is one of the “ABCD” companies
(“Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus”) that
control the world’s food supply, and they tripled their profits during
the lockdown. Monopolies gouge everyone – even governments. Pfizer
charged the NHS £18-22/shot for vaccines that cost £5/shot to make. They
took the British government for £2bn – that’s enough to pay last year’s
pay hike for NHS nurses, six times over, But monopolies also abuse their
suppliers, especially their employees. All over the world, competition
authorities are uncovering “wage fixing” and “no poaching” agreements
among large firms, who collude to put a cap on what workers in their
sector can earn. Unions report workers having their pay determined by
algorithms. Bosses lock employees in with noncompetes and huge repayment
bills for “training”:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/04/its-a-trap/#a-little-on-the-nose
Monopolies corrupt our governments. Companies with huge markups can
spend some of that money on lobbying. The 20 largest companies in the
world spend more than €155m/year lobbying in the US and alone, not
counting the money they spend on industry associations and other cutouts
that lobby on their behalf. Big Tech leads the pack on lobbying,
accounting for 82% of EU lobbying spending and 58% of US lobbying. One
key monopoly lobbying priority is blocking climate action, from Apple
lobbying against right-to-repair, which creates vast mountains of
e-waste, to energy monopolist lobbying against renewables. And energy
companies are getting more monopolistic, with Exxonmobil spending $65b
to buy Pioneer and Chevron spending $60b to buy Hess. Many of the
world’s richest people are fossil fuel monopolists, like Charles and
Julia Koch, the 18th and 19th richest people on the Forbes list. They
spend fortunes on climate denial. When people talk about the climate
impact of billionaires, they tend to focus on the carbon footprints of
their mansions and private jets, but the true environmental cost of the
ultra rich comes from the anti-renewables, pro-emissions lobbying they
buy with their monopoly winnings. The good news is that the tide is
turning on monopolies. A coalition of “businesses, workers, farmers,
consumers and other civil society groups” have created a “remarkably
successful anti-monopoly movement.” The past three years saw more
regulatory action on corporate mergers, price-gouging, predatory
pricing, labor abuses and other evils of monopoly than we got in the
past 40 years. The business press – cheerleaders for monopoly – keep
running editorials claiming that enforcers like Lina Khan are getting
nothing done. Sure, WSJ, Khan’s getting nothing done – that’s why you
ran 80 editorial about her:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/14/making-good-trouble/#the-peoples-champion
(Khan’s winning like crazy. Just last month she killed four
megamergers:)
https://www.thesling.org/the-ftc-just-blocked-four-mergers-in-a-month-heres-how-its-latest-win-fits-into-the-broader-campaign-to-revive-antitrust/
The EU and UK are taking actions that would have been unimaginable just
a few years ago. Canada is finally set to get a real competition law,
with the Trudeau government promising to add an “abuse of dominance”
rule to Canada’s antitrust system. Even more exciting are the moves in
the global south. In South Africa, “competition law contains some of the
most progressive ideas of all”: It actively seeks to create greater
economic participation, particularly for ‘historically disadvantaged
persons’ as part of its public interest considerations in merger
decisions. Balzac wrote, “Behind every great fortune there is a crime.”
Chances are, the rapsheet includes an antitrust violation. Getting rid
of monopolies won’t get rid of all the billionaires, but it’ll certainly
get rid of a hell of a lot of them. Hey look at this (permalink) The

from the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). The study analyzed
transcripts of more than 12,000 climate-related YouTube videos posted
since 2018 and found evidence that “old denial” narratives (Global
warming isn’t real! Humans have nothing to do with it!) are becoming
less common as the effects of climate change become undeniable. But
they’re being replaced by what the researchers call “new denial”
tactics. These narratives focus on discrediting climate solutions like
renewable energy projects and electric vehicles, or downplaying the
harmful effects of global warming. “New denial” claims more than tripled
since 2018; “old denial” claims were down by one-third.

The shift exposes a gap in YouTube’s disinformation policies: While the
platform has cracked down on advertising on videos that deny outright
that climate change is real, no such rules exist for the wave of “new
denial.” The study estimates YouTube could be making up to $13.4 million
per year in ad revenue from channels that promote denial. “Given that
the battleground has shifted and the new denial is the biggest component
of climate denial content overall, it’s time for them to extend their
rules to that as well,” Imran Ahmed, founder and chief executive officer
of the CCDH,

<li>Shipping emissions on the rise due to Red Sea conflict

<strong></strong>Greenhouse gas emissions from the shipping sector are
increasing due to ongoing disruption in the Red Sea, <em>Reuters</em>

The Red Sea is the gateway to the Suez Canal, which offers a quick route
for ships transporting goods from Asia to Europe. Iranian-backed Houthi
rebels have been attacking ships in the region in response to the
Israel-Hamas war. To avoid the conflict, vessels are taking longer
routes via the southern tip of Africa and burning more fuel as a result.
The average container vessel transporting goods from China to Rotterdam
via the Suez Canal would spew about 41,000 tons of carbon dioxide, but
that total jumps to 55,000 tons if that ship has to go the long way,
<em>Reuters</em> says. And as ships increase their speeds to make up for
lost time, they produce even more pollution. International shipping
already accounts for about 2% of global energy-related CO2,

<p>
<strong></strong>Southeast Asia has increased its solar- and wind-power
capacity by 20% in the last year, according to a new
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=9ef39586d3&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>
from Global Energy Monitor (GEM). The analysis looks at the energy mix
across 10 countries that make up the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN). These include Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, the
Philippines, and Cambodia. It finds that solar and wind account for 9%
of electricity generating capacity in the region, and flags Vietnam as
being a regional leader. When combined with hydropower, geothermal, and
bioenergy, this brings the ASEAN bloc’s renewable capacity to 32%, which
is very near its goal of 35% by 2025. GEM says this target is therefore
“unambitious.” The report cautions that fossil fuel use is likely to
rise in the region as “energy demands are outpacing utility-scale solar
and wind development.”

<li>Mountain goats are becoming more nocturnal

<p>
<strong></strong>Mountain goats are daytime creatures, and they usually
do most of their foraging while the sun is up. But as global
temperatures rise, they are becoming more active at night, according to
a new study
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=6229b55e17&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">seen
by<em> The Guardian</em></a>. Researchers from the University of
Sassari, in Sardinia, tracked the behaviors of the Alpine ibex goat over
13 years and found that on especially warm days, the animals were more
likely to be active at night, even though this put them at higher risk
of being attacked by predators. “We can expect that during the night
when the temperature is lower other animals will shift their activity
towards the nocturnal hours,”

Brivio</a>, who co-authored the study, tells <em>The Guardian</em>. “If
during the day it is too hot to eat or to be active, they will prefer to
perform all their activities, like foraging, at night.”

Many of the nation’s largest banks have reported mixed results recently.
Banks often turn to fees – including overdraft charges – to help boost
their bottom lines. But a Biden administration rule announced Wednesday
would reduce those fees and save consumers billions a year. Then, Apple
is making changes to its App Store but will still charge a hefty
commission. And shipping rates have soared following continued Red Sea
attacks.

<h2 id="code-written-with-ai-assistants-is-less-secure">Code Written
with AI Assistants Is Less Secure</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, updated: 2024-01-05, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Interesting research: “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03622">Do
Users Write More Insecure Code with AI Assistants?</a>“:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> We conduct the first large-scale user study examining
how users interact with an AI Code assistant to solve a variety of
security related tasks across different programming languages. Overall,
we find that participants who had access to an AI assistant based on
OpenAI’s codex-davinci-002 model wrote significantly less secure code
than those without access. Additionally, participants with access to an
AI assistant were more likely to believe they wrote secure code than
those without access to the AI assistant. Furthermore, we find that
participants who trusted the AI less and engaged more with the language
and format of their prompts (e.g. re-phrasing, adjusting temperature)
provided code with fewer security vulnerabilities. Finally, in order to
better inform the design of future AI-based Code assistants, we provide
an in-depth analysis of participants’ language and interaction behavior,
as well as release our user interface as an instrument to conduct
similar studies in the future…

<em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Data released on Wednesday showed
that China had a population of 1.4 billion at the end of 2023 — a 2.08
million decrease from 2022. The decline underscores concerns about the

Is Far Less Climate-Friendly Than Most Americans Think</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDcyOTA0My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMTMxNzk2NX0.Prii2t15LJ-e9kjw_QiHWEewSrNKuWHU2N7o3ZYYmls/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
A year ago, the Toyota Prius went from bulbous to badass. The hybrid
icon got its most dramatic redesign in two decades, which dispensed with
the familiar friendly and rounded look for an angular, almost menacing
front end. The vehicle, which once again came in traditional hybrid and
plug-in hybrid variants, earned enthusiasm from buyers and
<a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/toyota-prius-hybrid-2024-car-of-the-year/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plaudits</a>
from the auto press.
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/16/23462123/2023-toyota-prius-glow-up-redesign-still-hybrid-not-ev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">What
Toyota didn’t do</a>, curiously, was finally turn the Prius into a true
battery electric vehicle.
</p>
<p>
The world’s largest car company has been among the slowest of the major
automakers to embrace 100% electric propulsion. Yet, as Heatmap data
shows, such heel-dragging hasn’t dinged Toyota’s green reputation. In
our
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/change-polling-concern-belief-republicans-vs-democrats" target="_blank">November
2023 survey</a>, Toyota scored the second-highest on perceived
sustainability of any automaker.

</p>
<p>
Audi’s E-Tron, VW’s ID.4, Kia’s Soul EV, BMW’s i3, and Hyundai’s Kona
Electric were all on sale in the U.S. well before the
<a href="https://www.toyota.com/bz4x/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bZ4X</a>,
Toyota’s first mass market EV. Yet none of those cars could transform
American attitudes about companies that made them. While Tesla’s
notoriety helped it to top our sustainability survey, the likes of Audi,
Volkswagen, Kia, Hyundai, and BMW all scored below Toyota.
</p>
<p>
To be clear, Toyota certainly earned some sustainable bona fides. The
Prius for years was the icon of conspicuous conscientious driving.
Eventually, the car of the eco-minded became the car of anybody who
wanted to get great gas mileage. In selling
<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a46274770/hybrid-history-toyota-prius-porsche/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">six
million Priuses</a>, Toyota helped countless drivers post far better mpg
than they otherwise would have. And let us not forget the Toyota Mirai,
which since 2014 has been the best mainstream option for anybody who
wants to drive a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle.
</p>
<p>
But the results go to show that even at the dawn of the mainstream EV
era, more goes into the popular idea of “sustainability” than purely
electric cars.
</p>
<p>
Volkswagen, for example, may have introduced a popular EV with the ID.4
crossover, but many respondents surely remember the
<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15339250/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-vw-diesel-emissions-scandal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">scandal</a>
over VW’s diesel emissions and punished the German giant for its
misdeeds.
</p>
<p>
Or consider the case of Subaru, which was not part of this survey. The
brand incessantly advertises itself as a friend of the National Park
System and touts its corporate donations to climate causes. Its car show
launch events and television commercials depict Subarus in outdoor
environments. Given its public image, I’d have to guess that Subaru
would have scored highly. Yet none of its vehicles get particularly high
gas mileage. (There is a
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=214106706339905" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Subaru
commercial</a> that drives my wife and me crazy, in which a teacher
describes her 240-mile daily carbon-spewing commute like it’s a badge of
honor.) Like Toyota, Subaru was slow into the EV market; its first, the
Solterra, just came out last year. It was co-developed with Toyota and
is fundamentally the same car as the bZ4X.
</p>
<p>
Despite leading the charge on hybrids and hydrogen, Toyota’s electric
enthusiasm has been tepid at best. Whereas many auto giants have trotted
out new electrics or teased battery-powered versions of their iconic gas
vehicles, Toyota’s attitude more mirrored the general public’s:
<em>We’ll just wait until the charging infrastructure makes this more
practical for daily driving, thank you very much. </em>In the meantime,
the brand touts its “electrified” lineup, which, aside from the bZ4X, is
made up entirely of hybrids that also burn gasoline.
</p>
<p>
And to drive the point home, Toyota has also actively
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/25/climate/toyota-electric-hydrogen.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">worked
against</a> emissions regulations, repeatedly
<a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/articles/2022/08/toyotas-green-image-isnt-what-you-think-for-one-where-are-electric-vehicles" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lobbying</a>
against such efforts. In 2021, the company
<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/toyota-motor-company-pay-180-million-settlement-decade-long-noncompliance-clean-air-act" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">settled</a>
with the U.S. government for $180 million for failing to comply with
Clean Air Act regulations. Hino, a truck- and bus-making division of
Toyota, was caught falsifying engine emissions data going back decades.
</p>
<p>
Seeing the lukewarm reception given many legacy carmakers’ EV offerings,
it’s hard to blame Toyota for languishing in the rear, content to keep
selling fossil-fuel burning vehicles for as long as it’s profitable. It
also must answer a tricky question: What is the EV Prius? The hybrid
standard-bearer had a clear identity as an eggshell that delivered top
gas mileage. In the EV space, where even big vehicles deliver excellent
mileage equivalence, it’s unclear what the Prius brand name will mean.
</p>
<p>
But pretty soon, Toyota needs to pounce. The company is clearly getting
a little closer to ready: A couple of months ago I came to praise the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/toyota-hilux-revo-ev-tacoma-america" target="_self">Hilux
EV</a>, a prototype fully electric version of Toyota’s global
best-selling compact truck. That project was a one-off built by
engineers overseas, but it points the way to how Toyota could flex its
global muscles to help turn the world fleet over to EVs. Toyota is also
seen as among the most reliable carmakers — for example, Toyota and its
sub-brand Lexus topped the 2023 <em>Consumer Reports</em>
<a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/car-reliability-owner-satisfaction/who-makes-the-most-reliable-cars-a7824554938/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reliability
rankings.</a> That, combined with its reputation for sustainability,
could be enough to convince hesitant car shoppers to go fully electric
once the brand finally rolls out EV editions of the Camry, RAV4, or,
yes, the Prius.
</p>
<p>
The bZ4X might have been
<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/toyota/bz4x" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">uninspiring</a>,
but that’s not what really matters. What matters is that Toyota is
finally moving into true EVs — and soon, we hope, it will do a lot more
to back up its good name among climate-friendly companies.

<p>[Warning: paragraphs 6–8 talk about rape.] In yesterday’s Iowa
caucus, 51% of Republican caucusgoers chose former president Donald
Trump as their preferred candidate for the 2024 Republican presidential
nomination. Twenty-one percent of Republican caucusgoers chose Florida
governor Ron DeSantis. Nineteen percent chose former South Carolina
governor Nikki Haley. Seven percent chose technology entrepreneur Vivek
Ramaswamy. These results mean that 20 of Iowa’s 40 delegates will go to
Trump; 8 to DeSantis; 7 to Haley; and three to Ramaswamy. An apparent
Trump surrogate in the primary debates, Ramaswamy suspended his campaign
after the caucus and endorsed Trump.</p>

id="trump-back-in-court-for-second-defamation-trial-after-iowa-victory">Trump
Back in Court for Second Defamation Trial After Iowa Victory</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Fresh off a campaign victory in Iowa, Donald Trump sat in
a New York courtroom on Tuesday to defend himself for a second time
against charges that he defamed writer E. Jean Carroll after she accused
him of raping her decades ago.</p>
<p>Trump watched from the defendant’s table as Carroll’s lawyer told a
jury that the then-U.S. president made her life miserable when she went
public in 2019 with her story that he had attacked her in a department
store dressing room in Manhattan.</p>
<p>“He used the world’s biggest microphone to attack Ms. Carroll, to
humiliate her, and to destroy her reputation,” lawyer Shawn Crowley
said.</p>
<p>Carroll, 80, is seeking at least $10 million in damages in a civil
case that will put the allegations of sexual assault back in the
headlines while Trump pursues the 2024 Republican presidential
nomination.</p>
<p>Jurors will only consider how much Trump should pay Carroll in
damages, not whether the alleged assault took place or whether Trump
lied about it afterward.</p>
<p>Crowley said Trump’s “horrible” lies unleashed a torrent of abuse
from his followers and wrecked her sense of safety.</p>
<p>“As he’s campaigning for president of the United States, Donald Trump
continues to lie about Ms. Carroll,” Crowley said.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyer Alina Habba countered that Carroll was “basking in the
limelight” in the years since she released her memoir and accused Trump
of rape.</p>
<p>“She is looking for you to give her a windfall because some people on
social media said mean things about her,” Habba said.</p>
<p>Trump, 77, has said he wants to testify.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan has barred him from arguing that he
did not defame or sexually assault Carroll or that she made up her
account.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Trump accused Carroll on social media of lying as court
proceedings got underway on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Shortly after the court adjourned for the day, Trump accused Kaplan
of being politically biased against him, echoing complaints he has made
against judges overseeing his other cases.</p>
<p>Trump could spend much of this year shuttling between campaign
rallies and courtrooms, as he seeks to win the 2024 Republican
presidential nomination.</p>
<p>He won the first state contest in Iowa on Monday by a wide margin,
and opinion polls show him leading in the next contest in New Hampshire
a week from Tuesday.</p>
<p>“I should be in New Hampshire, campaigning and fighting for our
Country, and I will be later today, but for now I had to spend time in a
Federal Courthouse with a Trump Hating, Radical Left Judge,” Trump wrote
on his Truth Social platform after the court adjourned for the day.</p>
<p>Trump has pleaded not guilty in four criminal cases that could
potentially land him in prison before the November presidential
election, including two that accuse him of trying to overturn his 2020
loss to Democrat Joe Biden. He also is a defendant in at least two other
civil cases.</p>
<p>Kaplan said he expects the trial to last three to five days.</p>
<p>Second trial</p>
<p>Trump’s high profile was apparent as prospective jurors were screened
for the case. Many acknowledged they were familiar with Trump’s various
legal troubles, though none said they knew the details of the first
defamation trial.</p>
<p>One said she used to work for his daughter Ivanka. She was not chosen
for the jury.</p>
<p>Jurors’ identities are being kept confidential.</p>
<p>Trump has already lost one defamation case against Carroll.</p>
<p>A jury last May ordered Trump to pay the former Elle magazine
columnist $5 million for having sexually abused her during the encounter
and defaming her in 2022 by denying that it happened. Trump skipped that
trial.</p>
<p>Trump is appealing the $5 million award and could appeal any award at
the second trial. Appeals could take years.</p>
<p>In both cases, Trump has said he did not know Carroll and that she
invented their encounter to sell her memoir.</p>
<p>Kaplan has barred Trump from suggesting he did not rape Carroll, as
New York’s penal law defines the term, because the first jury did not
find that Trump committed rape. Kaplan has ruled that Carroll’s rape
claim was “substantially true.”</p>
<p>Trump also cannot discuss DNA evidence or Carroll’s sexual activities
or suggest that Democrats are bankrolling her case.</p>
<p>As at the first trial, jurors will be able to see the 2005 “Access
Hollywood” video where Trump graphically described the ability of famous
people like himself to have sexual relations with beautiful women.</p>
<p>Kaplan has said the video could offer “useful insight into
Mr. Trump’s state of mind” toward Carroll.</p>
<p>On social media, Trump accused Kaplan of being “biased,” echoing
attacks he has made on judges overseeing some of his other cases.</p>

id="us-to-relist-yemens-houthis-as-specially-designated-global-terrorists-ap-sources-say">US
to Relist Yemen’s Houthis as Specially Designated Global Terrorists, AP
Sources Say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is expected to soon announce
plans to redesignate Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen as specially
designated global terrorists, according to two people familiar with the
White House decision and a U.S. official.</p>
<p>The move comes as the Houthis have launched dozens of attacks on
commercial vessels in the Red Sea. The group says it has attacked the
ships in response to Israel’s military operations in Gaza in the
aftermath of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel.</p>
<p>The three people familiar with the decision were not authorized to
comment and requested anonymity to discuss the matter ahead of the
expected formal announcement.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken delisted the Houthis as both a
foreign terrorist organization and as specially designated global
terrorists in February 2021 as the administration sought to make it
easier to get food imports and humanitarian aid into Yemen.</p>
<p>In its waning days, the Trump administration designated the Houthis a
foreign terrorist organization over the strong objections of human
rights and humanitarian aid groups.</p>
<p>The foreign terrorist designation barred Americans and people and
organizations subject to U.S. jurisdiction from providing “material
support” to the Houthis, which the groups said would result in an even
greater humanitarian catastrophe than what was already happening in
Yemen.</p>
<p>Shortly after the Biden administration took office, Blinken removed
the designations in a step that was roundly criticized by conservative
lawmakers and others but was intended to keep much-needed food, medicine
and other aid flowing to Yemen.</p>
<p>Yemen, on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula bordering the Red Sea, is
the poorest country in the Arab world. War and chronic misgovernment
have left 24 million Yemenis at risk of hunger and disease as of 2023,
and roughly 14 million in acute need of assistance, the United Nations
says. About two-thirds of Yemenis live in territory controlled by the
Houthis.</p>
<p>While supporters of broad sanctions argue it’s possible to shape any
enforcement mechanisms to exempt food and humanitarian aid, aid
organizations worry that fears of running afoul of U.S. regulation could
scare away shippers, banks and other players vital to Yemen’s commercial
food supply. Arid Yemen imports 90% of its food.</p>
<p>“This designation would add another level of uncertainty and threat
for Yemenis still caught in one of the world’s largest humanitarian
crises,” said Scott Paul, an associate director of Oxfam America. “The
Biden administration is playing with fire, and we call on them to avoid
this designation immediately and prioritize the lives of Yemenis
now.”</p>
<p>The specially designated global terrorists label to be reimposed on
the Houthis does not include sanctions for providing “material support,”
and it does not come with travel bans that are also imposed with the
foreign terrorist organization label, steps intended to help prevent the
U.S. move from harming ordinary Yemenis.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a senior White House official said Tuesday that addressing
the ongoing threat by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on commercial vessels in the
Red Sea is an “all hands on deck” problem that the U.S. and allies must
address together to minimize impact on the global economy.</p>
<p>“How long this goes on and how bad it gets comes down not just to the
decisions of the countries in the coalition that took strikes last
week,” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said during
an appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.</p>
<p>The Iran-backed Houthi group has launched dozens of attacks since
November on vessels in the Red Sea, a vital corridor for the world’s
shipping traffic, in what they say is an effort to support Palestinians
in the war with Israel. U.S. and British forces have responded by
carrying out dozens of air and sea strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen
since Friday. The attacks by the Houthis have continued.</p>
<p>Linda Thomas Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
said last week that 2,000 ships since November have been forced to
divert thousands of miles to avoid the Red Sea. Houthi militants have
threatened or taken hostage mariners from more than 20 countries.</p>
<p>The Red Sea attacks have already caused significant disruptions to
global trade. Oil prices have edged higher in recent days, though Brent
crude futures were down slightly in early trading Tuesday.</p>
<p>The U.S. launched a new strike against the Houthis on Tuesday,
hitting anti-ship missiles in the third assault on the Iranian-backed
group in recent days. The strike came as the Iranian-backed Houthis
claimed responsibility for a missile attack against the Malta-flagged
bulk carrier Zografia in the Red Sea. No one was injured.</p>
<p>Sullivan said it was critical that countries with influence on Tehran
and other Middle East capitals make it clear “that the entire world
rejects wholesale the idea that a group like the Houthis can basically
hijack the world.”</p>
<p>President Joe Biden’s senior adviser acknowledged that the Houthi
attacks in the Red Sea as well as groups allied with Iran carrying out
attacks in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen pose concerns that the
Israel-Hamas war could escalate even as Israeli officials have indicated
a shift in intensity in their military campaign.</p>
<p>“We have to guard against and be vigilant against the possibility
that in fact, rather than heading towards de-escalation, we are on a
path of escalation that we have to manage,” Sullivan said.</p>
<p>The comments from Sullivan came after Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh
Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said during an appearance at the
Davos forum that the situation in the Middle East is a “recipe for
escalation everywhere.” He said Qatar believes that ending the conflict
in Gaza will stop the Houthis and militant groups from launching attacks
elsewhere in the region.</p>
<p>Sullivan on Tuesday met with Al Thani as well as Iraqi Prime Minister
Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and Iraqi Kurdish Prime Minister Masrour
Barzani, according to the White House.</p>
<p>Iran fired missiles late Monday at what it said were Israeli “spy
headquarters” in an upscale neighborhood near the sprawling U.S.
Consulate compound in Irbil, the seat of Iraq’s northern semi-autonomous
Kurdish region, and at targets linked to the extremist Islamic State
group in northern Syria.</p>
<p>Iraq on Tuesday called the attacks, which killed several civilians, a
“blatant violation” of Iraq’s sovereignty and recalled its ambassador
from Tehran.</p>

<h2 id="dos-revisited">86-DOS revisited</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>Recently, the oldest known versions of DOS were uploaded to the
internet, and Michal Necasek dove into the floppy images. Even after
more than 40 years(!), old software releases and pre-releases can still
surface. In the case of 86-DOS 0.11 and 0.34 it’s practically a miracle,
since there were probably never very many copies in existence. For the
first time since the early 1980s, FAT formatted floppies with the
primordial 16-byte directory entry format have come to light. The old
16-byte directory entries were gone by 86-DOS 1.0 in April 1981 and of
course never appeared in any public PC DOS release. These prehistoric
versions of 86-DOS allow us to fill in further missing pieces in the
puzzle of DOS origins. It is fascinating to follow how DOS developed
from almost nothing to a multi-million dollar business in the course of
just a few years. ↫ Michal Necasek It started out so humbly. Yet, here
we are, in 2024, and variants of DOS still have their uses in certain
niches. An incredible legacy, for sure.</p>

id="a-shocking-amount-of-the-web-is-machine-translated-insights-from-multi-way-parallelism">A
shocking amount of the web is machine translated: insights from
multi-way parallelism</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>We show that content on the web is often translated into many
languages, and the low quality of these multi-way translations indicates
they were likely created using Machine Translation (MT). Multi-way
parallel, machine generated content not only dominates the translations
in lower resource languages; it also constitutes a large fraction of the
total web content in those languages. We also find evidence of a
selection bias in the type of content which is translated into many
languages, consistent with low quality English content being translated
en masse into many lower resource languages, via MT. Our work raises
serious concerns about training models such as multilingual large
language models on both monolingual and bilingual data scraped from the
web. ↫ Brian Thompson, Mehak Preet Dhaliwal, Peter Frisch, Tobias
Domhan, Marcello Federico As a translator myself, this is entirely
unsurprising. Translating is a craft, a skill, and much like with any
other craft, you get what you pay for. If you pay your translator(s) a
good rate, you get a good translation. If you pay your translator(s) a
shit rate, you get a shit translation. If you pay nothing, you get
nothing. I’m definitely seeing more and more people in my industry
integrate machine translations, but so far, it’s not been an actual
issue – I have no qualms about accepting a job where I take a
machine-translated text and whip it into shape and turn it into a
human-readable, quality translation… As long as people pay me a
reasonable rate for it. Working from a machine translation is often
quicker and easier, so the going rate obviously reflects that. The
quality of machine translations is absolutely atrocious, however, and
the idea of relying on it for texts other people – customers, clients,
employees, etc. – are actually supposed to read and work from is
terrifying. Google Translate is an effective tool for personal use, but
throwing, I don’t know, your product’s manual at it and dumping the
unedited result onto your customers is borderline criminal. Pay nothing,
get nothing.</p>
