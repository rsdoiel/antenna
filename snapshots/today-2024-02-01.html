THE TOP FIVE

<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Podesta to become new climate envoy</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
Senior Biden advisor John Podesta will take over from former Secretary
of State John Kerry as the U.S. special envoy for climate change, the
White House
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=fed2c77d47&e=f1409a4534" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a>.
Kerry, who’s stepping down this spring, was the first person to hold the
position; while his role was based at the State Department, Podesta will
instead remain at the White House,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=b9c6e030f2&e=f1409a4534" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a>
Maxine Joselow in the <em>Washington Post</em>, with his title changing
to “senior adviser to the president for international climate policy.”
</p>
<p>
The appointment marked an expansion of Podesta’s current role
implementing Biden’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act.
He’s going to continue that work — which, Joselow writes, probably means
he’ll travel less often than Kerry — but will now also be tapped to help
Biden manage relationships with foreign powers.
</p>
<p>
If you’d like some insight into how Podesta thinks about climate change
and the IRA, our
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=64f9b5a855&e=f1409a4534" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview
</a>with him from the sidelines of COP 28 in Dubai might be a good place
to start.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Climate laws begin at home</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
The IRA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (better known as
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, or BIL) are filled with subsidies to
help with the clean energy transition. But, as I
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/ira-bil-tax-incentives-guides" target="_blank">wrote</a>
on the site yesterday, a new study shows that while the share of funds
for household improvements in each act is relatively small — about 12%
in the IRA and 5.7% in the BIL — the impact those improvements could
have on emissions is proportionally huge. Household emissions, the study
authors write, could decrease by as much as 40% by 2030.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>GM’s bringing back hybrids</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
In the face of
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/dealers-to-gm-we-want-hybrids-5387d2bf" target="_blank">dealer
protests</a>, GM CEO Marry Barra told investors this week that the
automaker would bring back plug-in hybrids. That’s a reversal from the
company’s stance of just a few years ago,
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/gms-all-in-electric-future-now-includes-gasoline/" target="_blank">reports</a>
David Ferris at <em>E&amp;E News</em>, when GM said it was “all in” on
electric vehicles, and is a sign of the difficulties automakers have
faced in trying to switch over to EVs.
</p>
<p>
The announcement comes the same week as
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61344" target="_blank">new
data</a> showing EVs and hybrids made up more than 16% of total
light-duty vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2023, up from 12.9% in 2022.
Italian luxury automaker Lamborghini also
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/lamborghini-will-make-hybrid-versions-of-all-its-cars-to-cut-its-co2/" target="_blank">announced</a>
that it will start producing hybrid versions of all its models.

<li>Crypto mines face an energy accounting</li>

</h3>
<p>
Next week the Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration
will start collecting data on the energy use of cryptocurrency mining,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=1f46a4db56&e=f1409a4534" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a>
Justine Calma in <em>The Verge</em>. It’s a win for activists and
lawmakers who have long warned of the climate impacts of crypto
projects, which are so energy-hungry that they’ve spurred the reopening
of some shuttered fossil fuel plants.
</p>
<p>
“We intend to continue to analyze and write about the energy
implications of cryptocurrency mining activities in the United States,”
said EIA Administrator Joe DeCarolis in a
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=39532208f5&e=f1409a4534" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press
release</a>. “We will specifically focus on how the energy demand for
cryptocurrency mining is evolving, identify geographic areas of high
growth, and quantify the sources of electricity used to meet
cryptocurrency mining demand.”

<li>Ford to give away Tesla charger adapters</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
Ford will send free Tesla charging adapters to owners of its Mustang
Mach-E and Ford F-150 Lightning EVs in the U.S. and Canada,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=2ebd18dffa&e=f1409a4534" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a>
CEO Jim Farley on X. The adapters will allow Ford owners to access one
of the largest and most reliable charging networks in the country.
They’re also another nail in the coffin of the Combined Charging
Standard or CCS, which Ford and other automakers defaulted to before
Ford — followed shortly after by practically every other automaker in
the country — announced it would switch to the Tesla plug, which is now
known as the North American Charging Standard.

<a href="https://heatmap.news/heatmap-is-hiring-a-climate-tech-reporter" target="_self"></a>The
Sun’s magnetic poles are due to flip starting this year,

Brian Resnick in <em>Vox</em>. The flip could cause solar storms that
disrupt communications satellites, but will also lead to more vivid
auroras. So start planning your aurora trips now — just maybe don’t
count on having GPS the whole way.

<p>I write this not to advocate for people immigrating to the United
States or to campaign against them. This is a story about a desperate
journey that tens of thousands are making, in spite of the cost or
consequences. Because they feel they must. It is not about one person or
group. I am using the stories of Venezuelans as an example because so
many have fled their country and are coming to ours. In 2023, more than
260,000 Venezuelan migrants crossed the U.S.-Mexico border. Venezuela’s
migrants represent the largest displacement crisis in the world.</p>

<h2 id="us-strikes-multiple-drones-in-yemen-american-official-says">US
Strikes Multiple Drones in Yemen, American Official Says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States struck up to 10 unmanned drones in
Yemen that were preparing to launch, a U.S. official said late on
Wednesday, amid escalating tensions from the war in Gaza spreading
through the region.</p>
<p>A U.S. Navy ship also shot down three Iranian drones and a Houthi
anti-ship ballistic missile in the Gulf of Aden, the U.S. military’s
Central Command said in a statement. There were no injuries or damage
reported, it said.</p>
<p>The Iran-aligned Houthi militants, who control the most populous
parts of Yemen, have launched a wave of exploding drones and missiles at
commercial vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden in recent weeks,
calling it a response to Israel’s military operations in Gaza and a show
of solidarity to Palestinians.</p>
<p>The Houthi campaign has disrupted international shipping.</p>
<p>The United States and Britain have launched strikes on Houthi targets
in Yemen and returned the militia to a list of “terrorist groups.”</p>
<p>The Houthis, earlier on Wednesday, said their naval forces carried
out an operation targeting an “American merchant ship” in the Gulf of
Aden hours after firing missiles at U.S. Navy destroyer Gravely.</p>
<p>Houthi attacks on ships in and around the Red Sea have slowed trade
between Asia and Europe, raised fears of supply bottlenecks and alarmed
major powers concerned that the Gaza war may become a regional
conflict.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden said earlier in January that strikes on
Houthi targets would continue even as he acknowledged they may not be
halting their attacks.</p>
<p>Israel’s assault on the Hamas-run Gaza Strip followed a surprise
attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel on October 7, killing
1,200. The Gaza health ministry says nearly 27,000 people have been
killed in the fighting since.</p>

id="kataib-hezbollah-should-take-us-warning-seriously-white-house-says">Kataib
Hezbollah Should Take US Warning ‘Seriously,’ White House Says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The White House — National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby
warned that Kataib Hezbollah, an Iran-backed group based in Iraq, should
take “seriously” the Biden administration’s determination to respond to
Sunday’s drone attack by Iran-backed militants that killed three
American soldiers on a U.S. base in Jordan.</p>
<p>VOA White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara spoke with Kirby
following Kataib Hezbollah’s Tuesday announcement that it is suspending
all military operations against American troops in the region. Kirby
also discussed the war in Gaza and other challenges the U.S. is facing
around the world.</p>
<p>The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.</p>
<p>VOA: Do you attribute Kataib Hezbollah’s announcement to stop
attacking U.S. troops in the region to the president firmly signaling
that he is ready for a response?</p>
<p>JOHN KIRBY, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: It’s hard to know exactly why
Kataib Hezbollah put that statement out. They should take seriously the
determination of the United States and President [Joe] Biden to do what
we have to do to protect our troops, our facilities, our interests in
the region. They should take that very seriously.</p>
<p>VOA: You’re not attributing the attack to them. You’re attributing it
to their umbrella group, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq?</p>
<p>KIRBY: The Intelligence community’s comfortable with an assessment
that it was the umbrella group, Islamic Resistance in Iraq, that was
responsible for this attack. And as you know, there’s several groups
that are participants under that moniker.</p>
<p>VOA: And combining that answer with your statement that the U.S.
response will be multitiered over a period of time, can we assume that
what the president intends to do is striking different Iran-backed
proxies in the region over time?</p>
<p>KIRBY: I won’t get into the specific actions we’re going to take and
what the response looks like. The first thing that you see will not be
the last thing that you see.</p>
<p>VOA: You also said that striking these Iran-backed proxies won’t
jeopardize any kind of hostage negotiations with Hamas, but don’t these
groups have the same ideology?</p>
<p>KIRBY: What I said was, there’s no reason for what we’re doing to
protect our troops and our facilities to impact the negotiations that
we’re having to try to get another hostage deal in place, and we believe
both are important to do. And we’re pressing forward with both.</p>
<p>VOA: Are you saying one goal wouldn’t complicate the other?</p>
<p>KIRBY: I’m saying there’s no reason for there to be an effect on the
hostage negotiations that we’re in, by a response to this terrible
attack which killed three American soldiers.</p>
<p>VOA: U.S. funding for UNRWA won’t start until there are fundamental
changes in the agency. Those fundamental changes could take a while to
implement. What is the U.S. prepared to do in the meantime? Stand by and
allow war orphans to starve?</p>
<p>KIRBY: Of course not, and we are the world’s leading nation when it
comes to getting humanitarian assistance [to] the people of Gaza. And
UNRWA does essential work on the ground in Gaza. Make no mistake about
it, they’re helping save thousands of lives. They are the prime
distributor of aid and assistance inside Gaza, and we recognize
that.</p>
<p>We want them to take this seriously. Unacceptable that any employee
of UNRWA could be involved in the attacks on October 7, but we’re going
to wait and see how the investigation goes. We’re going to wait and see
what kind of accountability measures the U.N. and UNRWA, specifically,
are willing to put in place. But we’re going to continue to do
everything we can to get the security assistance into Gaza. And we
certainly want the vast majority of UNRWA employees, who have no
connection to Hamas, to be able to continue to do their job.</p>
<p>VOA: But you are admitting that stopping U.S. funding is impacting
their work, no?</p>
<p>KIRBY: It’s only affecting the work that we were doing in Jordan. The
suspension has nothing to do with Gaza. The money that we have left to
spend — that we suspended — has been already pre-earmarked by UNRWA for
use in Jordan, not for use in Gaza.</p>
<p>VOA: I’m going to move on to Ukraine funding. It appears that House
Republicans are rejecting any kind of border compromise, because they
don’t really want to give the president a win in an election year.</p>
<p>KIRBY: I certainly can’t talk about election politics or what may be
behind the motivations here. It’s critical that we get this funding for
Ukraine, for Israel, for the Indo-Pacific, and certainly for border
security.</p>
<p>The president is negotiating in good faith on the Senate side. We
believe those discussions are going well, and we hope to get a
resolution here relatively soon. Now, what happens in the House is going
to be up to Speaker [Mike] Johnson, and Speaker Johnson has not been
consistent in what he says he wants to see at the border. So, I would
point people to him. He has to speak for the inconsistencies in his
messaging. But we are negotiating in good faith. We believe those
negotiations are making progress, and that’s what we’re focused on.</p>
<p>VOA: Are you still sticking to that approach? Would you consider
sending a new stand-alone bill just for Ukraine?</p>
<p>KIRBY: I don’t want to get ahead of where we are. I mean, we are in
the midst of negotiations right now that are not over. So, I wouldn’t
want to get into speculating about what hypotheticals might happen as a
result.</p>
<p>VOA: Can you confirm reporting that Chinese President Xi Jinping
promised President Biden that China will not meddle in U.S.
elections?</p>
<p>KIRBY: We gave a full summary of that meeting. The president talked
to you all after he met with President Xi. I don’t have any additional
context to share. All I can tell you is that we take the soundness of
our election system here in the United States very, very seriously. And
we’ve been clear publicly, and we’ve been clear privately with
interlocutors all around the world that we will do what we have to do to
make sure that our elections are free and fair. And they have been, and
they will continue to be.</p>
<p>VOA: But just today, Christopher Ray, the FBI director, gave
testimony in Congress that Chinese hackers might be targeting U.S.
infrastructure, targeting all sorts of things that may disrupt even the
election. How do you square that?</p>
<p>KIRBY: I won’t speak to specific threats. All I can tell you is we
take them seriously. We do everything we can to preserve critical
infrastructure, and in the president’s mind, our election system is
critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>VOA: A new report released by the U.N. sanctions monitoring team
today says that al-Qaida has established eight new training camps and a
new base to stockpile weaponry in Afghanistan. Are you aware, and are
you countering?</p>
<p>KIRBY: I think we’re just aware of this report. We haven’t worked our
way all the way through it. But I think it’s important to remember that
al-Qaida is a vastly diminished organization in Afghanistan and
elsewhere. In fact, the real threat from al-Qaida is the way it’s
metastasized into other groups elsewhere in the region, like al-Shabab
in Somalia.</p>
<p>VOA: Are you downplaying the threat?</p>
<p>KIRBY: Of course not. We’re not downplaying any terrorist threat
anywhere in the world. Those three American soldiers that were killed
were involved in helping our counter ISIS coalition, which is still
active in Iraq and Syria. I don’t think the record bears out that we’ve
been light on terrorist networks at all, killing [al-Qaida chief Ayman]
al-Zawahiri and other leaders in ISIS in just recent weeks and months.
What I’m saying is, this is a report we haven’t worked our way through
right now, and the intelligence community, their assessment is that
al-Qaida does not pose an immediate threat to U.S. soil.</p>
<p>VOA: Tomorrow, the president will participate in the dignified
transfer of the three American soldiers who died in Jordan. How do you
think that will impact Americans’ thinking about the conflict in the
Middle East?</p>
<p>KIRBY: I hope it underscores Americans’ gratitude for the service,
and in many cases, the sacrifice that American men and women in uniform
are demonstrating on their behalf, to keep them safe. And that’s
certainly the case with these three brave individuals who aren’t going
to make it back home alive to their families.</p>
<p>And I hope it’s also a reminder of how diligently President Biden is
working to keep the conflict between Israel and Hamas from escalating
and widening into a broader regional conflict. We don’t seek a war with
Iran. We don’t want to see a broader conflict, and almost everything the
president has done since the seventh of October has been designed to
prevent that from happening.</p>

id="john-podesta-to-be-top-us-international-adviser-on-climate-change">John
Podesta to be Top US International Adviser on Climate Change</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — White House senior adviser John Podesta will add
international climate policy to his job responsibilities, replacing
special climate envoy John Kerry as the top U.S. official on
international climate issues, the White House said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Kerry announced in mid-January that he would step down from the
climate job to work on President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign.
Podesta will take over Kerry’s responsibilities, though not his title,
when he departs, likely this spring, the White House said.</p>
<p>Podesta was a behind-the-scenes veteran on climate in past Democratic
administrations. He was brought back to the White House last year to put
into place an ambitious U.S. climate program revived with the $375
billion approved in the 2022 climate law. He also led the
administration’s climate task force.</p>
<p>Kerry’s job was created by the Biden administration specifically to
fight climate change on the global stage. Kerry has been in the position
since Biden took office in 2021.</p>
<p>Kerry’s appointment did not require confirmation by the Senate, but a
law passed in 2022 requires that special envoys reporting to the
secretary of state will have to win Senate approval.</p>
<p>In a step that avoids a potential partisan fight in the Senate,
Podesta was not named as climate envoy but rather a senior adviser to
the president for international climate policy.</p>
<p>As outlined Wednesday by the White House, Podesta will continue to be
involved in overseeing federal spending under the climate law, known as
the Inflation Reduction Act, along with domestic climate priorities,
adding the international portfolio that Kerry handled. The job will not
require Senate confirmation.</p>
<p>White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients said Kerry “has tirelessly
trekked around the world’’ to help confront the climate crisis, most
recently at a U.N. climate conference in Dubai late last year.</p>
<p>“There is no one better than John Podesta to make sure” the U.S.
continues to “meet the gravity of this moment,” Zients said, calling
Podesta “a fierce champion for bold climate action” who has served three
Democratic presidents and has Biden’s trust.</p>
<p>The Washington Post first reported Podesta’s appointment.</p>

<h2 id="us-marks-anniversary-of-myanmar-coup-with-new-sanctions">US
Marks Anniversary of Myanmar Coup With New Sanctions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. state department — The United States is imposing further
sanctions on Myanmar’s military regime three years after the February 1,
2021, military coup, and designating four individuals and two entities
associated with it.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department said the latest action targets sources of
revenue that support the regime’s military activities against civilians
and those who provide material and support for arms production in
Myanmar, also known as Burma.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions
against the Shwe Byain Phyu Group of Companies, its owner Thein Win Zaw,
and his wife and two adult children. Sanctions were also announced
against Myanma Five Star Line, a shipping company.</p>
<p>The two entities are said to maintain a relationship with Myanma
Economic Holdings Public Co. Ltd., or MEHL, which is controlled by the
now-ruling Burmese military or Tatmadaw. The Tatmadaw has long relied on
business activities to finance its own operations.</p>
<p>The Treasury said these two entities have facilitated the military
regime’s acquisition of foreign currency and the importation of
petroleum and other materials through their ties to MEHL.</p>
<p>Today’s sanctions freeze any U.S. assets of those targeted, and
generally bar Americans from dealing with them.</p>
<p>“Today, we have ramped up our economic and political pressure on the
military regime, including by restricting U.S. dollar transactions with
state-owned enterprises that provide revenue enabling the military to do
harm and kill its own civilians,” State Department spokesperson Matthew
Miller said during a briefing on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“We’re going to continue to support efforts by the opposition to the
regime and to seek a resolution of the conflict that provides for
genuine and inclusive multiparty democracy,” he said.</p>
<p>On February 1, 2021, Myanmar’s military forces ousted the
democratically elected government, stripping civilian leaders of their
power.</p>
<p>The coup triggered massive pro-democracy demonstrations that were
initially crushed with a deadly crackdown by the military, but has since
evolved into a conflict between the military and armed resistance forces
allied with several rural ethnic rebel groups who have been fighting for
decades for greater autonomy.</p>
<p>U.S. officials and lawmakers urge the Myanmar military to cease
violence against its people, release unjustly detained individuals,
permit unhindered humanitarian access, and respect the public’s will for
a return to representative democracy.</p>
<p>Speaking in Congress, U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell
said the conflict has displaced roughly 2.5 million people. He called
for the unconditional release of all political prisoners in Myanmar.</p>
<p>Almost 2,000 members of the National League for Democracy, Myanmar’s
main pro-democracy party, along with numerous others from across Burmese
society and various ethnic groups, are being unjustly detained as
political prisoners, according to McConnell.</p>
<p>Despite international pressure to stop assaults in civilian areas,
Myanmar’s regime has continued to use its military aircraft to conduct
bombings.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Amnesty International said new evidence suggests
Myanmar’s junta is using new tactics to import aviation fuel after
sanctions were imposed in response to air strikes that have unlawfully
killed and injured civilians.</p>
<p>Shipping data suggests there is an attempt to evade sanctions within
the aviation fuel supply chain. Direct sales of fuel have diminished.
Instead, intermediaries seem to be assisting in the purchase of fuel for
Myanmar, according to a report by the Amnesty International.</p>
<p>Last year — 2023 — was the worst for airstrikes in Myanmar since the
coup three years ago, according to Amnesty International.</p>
<p>“The best way to stop the Myanmar military from carrying out lethal
airstrikes is to stop all jet fuel imports into the country,” said
Montse Ferrer, deputy regional director for research at Amnesty
International.</p>

seems that Bard may ask to read and analyze your private message

when might this begin. ↫ Zak Doffman As long as this “AI” hoovering is
an optional ‘feature’, I don’t really have any issues with it – it’s a
free world, and if you want to spice up your autocomplete like this, go
ahead. The real danger, of course, is that this won’t be optional for
long, and eventually Google’s “AI” will just ingest your messages and
emails by default, consent or no.</p>

New Climate Laws’ Tax Credits for Homeowners Are Crazy Powerful</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTI0NjYwNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxMTQwMDA3MH0.qLNqtP_vrxne3dRqVWaloJC3zYqxU6w_zSDbRzLlzXY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
The Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
Act — better known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law — are together
filled with dozens of financial incentives to help regular Americans
switch to clean technologies. The IRA, in particular, is the largest
investment in confronting climate change the country has ever made. That
work is happening, in no small part, on the (literal) home front.
</p>
<p>
A
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421524000120?via%3Dihub" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new
study</a> published in the journal <em>Energy Policy</em> authored by
researchers from Vanderbilt University, shows that while only about 12%
of climate and energy funds in the IRA and 5.7% in the BIL target
voluntary household actions, they could leverage 40% of the cumulative
emissions reductions under those laws.
</p>
<p>
That’s a big return on investment, and a rare sign that regular citizens
might, after all, have some level of agency in helping solve a problem
that can often feel beyond our grasp. The authors note that getting to
that level of emissions reduction is perhaps easier said than done —
navigating the process of figuring out eligibility for tax credits,
determining cost savings, and actually contracting with local
professionals to install all that clean tech is a pretty significant
undertaking, and all those roadblocks could get in the way of that best
case scenario. The authors’ estimate also accounts for <em>all
</em>households in the country, whereas it’s much easier (and more
appealing) for an owner of a single-family home to make those kinds of
changes to their building than, say, a landlord who won’t see any direct
benefits from improving a building they’ve rented out.
</p>
<p>
A lot of pain points, then. But still, in the face of a huge and
abstract problem, knowing that individual actions <em>do</em> make a
difference is no small thing.
</p>
<p>
Want to take advantage of some of these incentives? We’ve got you
covered on at least a few of those fronts: my colleague Emily has
written a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/inflation-reduction-act-solar-panels-heat-pumps" target="_self">guide
to decarbonising your home with the IRA</a>, and Robinson has a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/ev-tax-credit-new-2023" target="_self">car
buyer’s guide to the 2024 EV tax credit</a>. That 40% emissions
reduction goal will take a lot of individual investment; those guides
(and more to come!) are good places to start.

before that was
<a href="https://www.weather.gov/lch/audrey" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hurricane

</p>
<p>
Now, though, few American communities are more obviously in the
crosshairs of climate change than Louisiana’s Cameron Parish. It’s not
just the influx of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/hurricanes-rapid-intensification-andra-garner" target="_self">supercharged
storms</a>, which have repeatedly wiped out homes and driven those with
the means to get out to flee north. The 5,000-or-so

residents of the parish, which borders Texas and the Gulf of Mexico in
Louisiana’s lower lefthand corner, also share their home with three of
the nation’s eight currently operational
<a href="https://www.ferc.gov/media/us-lng-export-terminals-existing-approved-not-yet-built-and-proposed" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">liquefied
natural gas export facilities</a>, according to the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission and the Energy Information Administration. One
more is under construction, according to FERC, with two more waiting to
break ground and even more in the pipeline — including Calcasieu Pass 2,
or CP2, a would-be $10 billion export facility and the largest yet
proposed in the U.S., the fate of which has been cast into limbo by the
Biden administration’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/biden-lng-export-trump-campaign" target="_self">pause
on new LNG export terminal permits</a>.
</p>
<p>
It is now the Department of Energy’s job to determine whether new
terminals are in the “public interest” once their climate impacts are
considered. It’s a directive that has ignited
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change-wind-solar-electric-vehicles-energy" target="_self">debate</a>
around the energy security of U.S. allies in Europe, the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-lng-exports-pause-young-voters-climate" target="_self">complicated

<a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/bidens-lng-exports-pause-leans-on-broad-public-interest-statute" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">jurisdiction</a>
of the DOE. What has fallen through the cracks in the national
conversation, though, is the direct impact this decision has on
communities like Cameron, which have been fighting for such a
reconsideration for years.

“In southwest Louisiana, where I live, my air here smells like rotten
eggs or chemicals every day,” Roishetta Ozane, the founder of Vessel
Project of Louisiana, a local mutual aid and environmental justice
organization, told me. A mother of six who started the Vessel Project
after losing her home to hurricanes Laura and Delta in 2020, Ozane
stressed that “we have above-average poverty rates, above-average cancer
rates, and above-average toxins in the air. And all of that is due to
the fact that we are surrounded by petrochemical, plastic-burning, and
industrial facilities, including LNG facilities.”
</p>
<p>
Hiatt, a Lake Charles native, told me something similar. “The other
night, [a terminal] was flaring like crazy, and people were just like,
‘Well, we gotta put up with that if we live here,’” he told me sadly.
“That’s a lack of imagination of what better could be.”

Activists like Ozane and Hiatt — and the
<a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/01/25/were-dying-here/fight-life-louisiana-fossil-fuel-sacrifice-zone#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20the%20UN%20Special,illustrating%20egregious%20human%20rights%20violations." target="_blank">United
Nations</a> — refer to places like Cameron Parish, Calcasieu Parish
directly to its north, and the stretch of the Mississippi River in
Louisiana known as
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/louisiana-cancer-alley-human-rights" target="_self">Cancer
Alley</a>” as sacrifice zones. “The industry wants people to believe
that this is rural land, that nobody lives here, that it is just
wetlands and swamp,” Ozane said.

<p>
LNG export terminals cool natural gas into its liquid form to prepare it
for overseas shipping, an energy-intensive process that releases
pollutants that environmental groups
<a href="https://labucketbrigade.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Gas_Export_Spotlight_CameronCalcasieuPass.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claim
are underreported</a>. Such pollutants often have known health risks,
including sulfur dioxide

<a href="https://www.tceq.texas.gov/airquality/sip/criteria-pollutants/sip-co" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">can
cause</a> organ and tissue damage). All that, of course, is in addition
to methane, the base of natural gas and a potent planet-warming
greenhouse gas that has cascading global effects, including
<a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3184/a-force-of-nature-hurricanes-in-a-changing-climate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hurricane
intensification</a>.
</p>
<p>
The region’s
<a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/plantations-petrochemicals-juneteenth" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">history
of slavery</a> has made the land around Cameron Parish cheap and easy to
exploit, which is part of the reason for the area’s high concentration
of terminals. “A lot of predominantly Black communities and
predominantly Black neighborhoods, very low-income white neighborhoods,
and fishermen towns are where these facilities are located,” Ozane went
on. “It’s easy for them to get land there because those masses of land
are owned by only a few people — a small family who can say yes to the
money and sell that land to industry.”
</p>
<p>
Politicians, lobbyists, and interest groups like the American Petroleum
Institute — which recently
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/10/oil-ads-lights-on-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a>
an eight-figure media campaign promoting natural gas — like to argue
that LNG export terminals create American jobs. Both Ozane and Hiatt
were rueful when I asked about the industry helping to lift up locals,
though. “If the jobs are so good, and the folks are getting the jobs in
these communities that are surrounded by these projects, then why is
Louisiana still the poorest state in the nation?” Ozane asked me. “Why
is our minimum wage still the lowest? And why do we have the highest
unemployment rate?” She went on, “We have all of these billion-dollar
industries here: They are not hiring local people.”
</p>
<p>
Hiatt emphasized that it’s hard to understand how little the community
is benefitting unless you see it for yourself. “If you drive through
Cameron, it looks like the hurricane happened yesterday in a lot of
places,” he said. “All these churches are just skeletons, just the
framework of what was once there. There’s no grocery store — there’s
nothing. If economic prosperity looks like that, then no thank you.” He
paused, then corrected himself: “It’s definitely economically prosperous
for the owners of these companies,” which are based out of state in
places like Virginia and Houston, he said.
</p>
<p>
These companies often don’t pay state or local taxes; the abatement for
Calcasieu Pass LNG alone is
<a href="https://www.1012industryreport.com/oil-gas/lng/venture-global-gets-lion-share-of-itep-tax-breaks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">valued
at $184 million annually</a>, or more than $36,000 per person in Cameron
Parish every year — roughly $2,000 more than
<a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/cameronparishlouisiana/INC910222#INC910222" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
area’s average annual income</a>.
</p>
<p>
While climate activists have celebrated the Biden administration’s LNG
pause, local organizers were more reserved in their praise. “We’re not
going to take a victory lap here because there’s so much more to do,”
Hiatt said, reminding me that “this fight did not happen overnight. This
fight for environmental justice has been going for over 40 years in
Louisiana.”
</p>
<p>
Kaniela Ing, the director of the Green New Deal Network, which promotes
public support for climate justice, was similarly measured in his
enthusiasm when I asked if the pause would have political upsides for
Democrats in November. “A lot of the people Biden relied on to win in
2020 — it’s not clear whether they’re motivated enough to turn out
again,” he told me. “Especially in BIPOC, low-income communities, and
youth voters.” And while the administration’s LNG pause could be viewed
as a direct appeal to such a voting bloc, Ing sees the move more as “a
highlight reel played at halftime. What matters is how you play the game
and right now, we don’t know the plan for the second half.”
</p>
<p>
An LNG permitting “pause” means nothing for the export terminals that
are already under construction or operating. And once the pause is over,
more approvals could come. For now, yes, Cameron has its hard-won
reprieve. But the status quo of high cancer rates, respiratory health
problems, poverty, and environmental exploitation remain unchanged for
those who currently call it home.
</p>
<p>
“My children have asthma,” Ozane said, “and they’re dealing with this
pollution every day.”

government,” the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement.</p>
<p>“These commodity sales provide a key source of funding for the
IRGC-QF and Hezbollah’s continued terrorist activities and support to
other terrorist organizations throughout the region,” it added.</p>
<p>The Treasury Department said it had imposed sanctions on Turkey-based
Mira Ihracat Ithalat Petrol, which purchases, transports, and sells
Iranian commodities on the global market, and its chief executive and
owner Ibrahim Talal al-Uwayr, who is also known under the alias Ibrahim
Agaoglu.</p>
<p>It also targeted two Lebanon-based entities, Yara Offshore SAL, a
company affiliated with Hezbollah that has facilitated large sales of
Iranian commodities to Syria, and Hydro Company for Drilling Equipment
Rental, which is involved in financing the IRGC-QF by facilitating the
shipment of Iranian commodities worth hundreds of millions of dollars to
Syria.</p>
<p>As a result of the sanctions, all property of those targeted in the
United States or that fall under the control of U.S. persons is
blocked.</p>
<p>U.S. regulations generally bar U.S. persons from dealing with
property of designated or otherwise blocked persons.</p>
<p>Further, non-U.S. financial institutions and others that engage in
certain dealings with those sanctioned may expose themselves to
sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action.</p>

Washington State Town Becomes Hub for EV Battery Production</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Moses Lake, Washington — It’s mid-winter in east Washington state,
yet despite the chilly fog, two construction sites in the town of Moses
Lake are brimming with activity. Several hundred workers are on an
ambitious timeline to complete two new factories slanted to begin
production of the next-generation components for electric vehicle
batteries later this year.</p>
<p>Two American start-ups, backed by $100 million in federal grants
each, in addition to commercial partnerships, are racing to secure the
domestic supply chain with the next-generation battery materials for EV
automakers.</p>
<p>“That’s going to go into everything from electric vehicles to IoT
[Internet of Things] devices to smartphones and wearables and a lot of
battery-based applications that we don’t even know exist yet,” explains
Nik Anderson, director of program management with Group 14 Technologies,
as he walks through the company’s vast construction site.</p>
<p>Washington is one of the American states planning to ban sales of new
gasoline-powered vehicles starting in 2035.</p>
<p>For now, electric cars account for 8.6% of new vehicle sales in the
United States. Affordable electric vehicles would require a significant
scaling of domestic battery production, experts say. According to the
Biden administration, affordable electric vehicles and reliable supply
chain would require a significant scaling of domestic battery production
and the national charging infrastructure.</p>
<p>Once fully operational, the two companies’ factories in Moses Lake
will be able to annually produce enough material to make batteries for
about 400,000 electric vehicles.</p>
<p>They also promise to produce a better battery, reducing the ‘charge
anxiety’ of electric cars by replacing the graphite in conventional
lithium-ion batteries with silicon-based components, which will allow
for a faster charge.</p>
<p>“The thing that makes our battery better, that uses our SCC55
[silicon-carbon composite] versus traditional graphite, is that it can
have up to 50% more energy density, it can allow for extremely fast
charging,” said Grant Ray, vice president for global market strategy
with Group 14.</p>
<p>“When we think about charge times, you know, right now we’re hearing
10% to 80% in ten minutes. Well, what if that changes and it comes down
to five minutes? What if it starts to get closer to what it really is
for, you know, the way we think about refueling a car?” he said.</p>
<p>One of the challenges for U.S. EV production with traditional
lithium-ion batteries is the need to rely on imports. Daniel Schwartz,
director of the Clean Energy Institute at the University of Washington,
says the silicon-based component provides solutions for several
challenges.</p>
<p>“The primary mineral for what’s going in Moses Lake is sand, silica —
the most widely distributed mineral in the crust of the earth. Graphite
is lower performance, and we are trade-exposed as a nation,” he
said.</p>
<p>The Biden administration invested in domestic EV battery production
as part of its ambitious clean energy agenda. Among the Republican
presidential candidates, most reject the urgency surrounding EV
adoption, with former President Donald Trump calling it an “all-electric
car hoax.”</p>
<p>Last September, speaking in front of hundreds of people attending a
rally in Clinton Township, Michigan, Trump called prioritizing EVs a
“transition to hell,” telling auto workers that Democrats “want to go
all electric and put you all out of business.”</p>
<p>Gene Berdichevsky, CEO of Sila Nanotechnologies, the second startup
planning to start EV battery components production in Moses Lake, says
the transition to electric vehicles is going to happen regardless of
whether the U.S. is taking the lead in the process.</p>
<p>“Renewables and batteries are really going to form the basis of
21st-century energy,” he said. “It’s critical for the U.S. to build the
capacity to be able to have battery production. Catching up to the world
leaders in Asia is quite challenging. And so, the way to do that is not
to build the same thing, it’s to build the next generation of battery
technologies.”</p>
<p>In Moses Lake, a town of about 25,000 an hour and-a-half drive from
the nearest city, all-electric cars are not a common sight. Berdichevsky
is convinced that EV adoption in the area is just a matter of time.</p>
<p>“We have to recognize that consumers want choice, and some consumers
are going to want electric cars with 500 miles (range),” he says. “What
we need to do is increase the choices for folks, and the way you do that
is through better batteries.”</p>
<p>Rosendo Alvarado, a Moses Lake native who took a job as a plant
manager for Sila Nanotechnologies, says the remote town became an
attractive spot for EV production thanks to the combination of several
factors: cheap hydro power provided by local dams; existing
manufacturing infrastructure and legacy companies, such as REC Silicon
that could become a partner in the EV batteries production; and
Washington state policies embracing clean energy initiatives.</p>
<p>The cutting-edge industry promises to bring hundreds of new jobs to
Moses Lake. Alvarado says he saw the town transforming over time from
traditional farming to an industrial community — and expects further
change.</p>
<p>“We worked in the fields that this building is sitting on today,” he
recalls. “It’s been fast paced, but super exciting — the opportunities
that we are able to bring here for the community and for the EV
market.”</p>
<p>He says the companies partnered with the local Columbia Basin
Technical School and Big Bend Community College to start developing a
new workforce as early as during high school classes.</p>
<p>“It’s a small, tight community. Kind of like everyone knows everyone
type thing,” shrugs Nicholas Cruz, a young man out of school walking
with his friend down the main street of Moses Lake, when asked about the
EV projects coming to town.</p>
<p>“It’s gonna be exciting in the sense, like, there’s more job
opportunities and new opportunities to go here because Moses Lake is
small, there’s not much to it. I am not sure if it will impact me
personally — I guess time will tell,” he said.</p>

By packing batteries and an electric drive axle into a tandem trailer
that fits between a conventional semi truck and trailer, Revoy EV
promises to “electrify” trucking and cut a fleet’s fuel bill in half. It
sounds amazing – but eleven tons of questions remain.

<h2 id="us-bracing-for-cyber-onslaught-from-china">US Bracing for ‘Cyber
Onslaught’ From China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Armies of hackers linked to the Chinese government are
relentlessly “burrowing deep” into the computer systems that help run
America’s critical infrastructure, posing an urgent threat that cannot
be ignored, according to a new warning from top U.S. security
officials.</p>
<p>The officials, from the FBI, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency, and U.S. military’s Cyber Command, testified Wednesday
before lawmakers, urging the country to act before it is too late.</p>
<p>“The risk that poses to every American requires our attention — now,”
FBI Director Christopher Wray told the Select Committee on the Chinese
Communist Party, emphasizing Beijing’s actions are putting innocent
civilians in the crosshairs.</p>
<p>“They’re not focused just on political and military targets,” Wray
said. “China’s hackers are positioning on American infrastructure in
preparation to wreak havoc and cause real-world harm to American
citizens and communities, if or when China decides the time has come to
strike.”</p>
<p>The director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency,
Jen Easterly, was equally blunt in her assessment of the wide-ranging
threat from the government in Beijing.</p>
<p>“This is truly an everything, everywhere, all at once scenario,” she
said. “Telecommunications going down so people can’t use their
cellphone, people start getting sick from polluted water, trains get
derailed, air traffic control systems are malfunctioning.”</p>
<p>China’s goal, Easterly added, would be to “incite societal panic and
chaos, and to deter our ability to marshal military might,” especially
in case of a conflict over Taiwan.</p>
<p>China rejected the accusations, blaming Washington for fomenting a
dangerous and unstable cyber environment.</p>
<p>“The Chinese government has been categorical in opposing hacking
attacks and the abuse of information technology,” said Liu Pengyu,
spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington.</p>
<p>“The United States has the strongest cyber technologies of all
countries, but has used such technologies in hacking, eavesdropping more
than others,” Liu told VOA in an email. “We urge the U.S. side to stop
making irresponsible criticism against other countries on the issue of
cyber-security.”</p>
<p>But to underscore the threat, the U.S. Justice Department Wednesday
announced it had taken steps to disrupt a Chinese-linked cyber threat
actor from hijacking common computer routers used by homes and small
businesses across the United States to access critical
infrastructure.</p>
<p>Watch related video by Patsy Widakuswara:</p>
<p>U.S. officials blamed the scheme on a group known as Volt Typhoon,
which gained international attention in May 2023 when tech giant
Microsoft uncovered an effort by the same hackers to infiltrate and
disrupt communications infrastructure in Guam, home to key U.S. military
facilities.</p>
<p>The recently disrupted scheme, officials said, was equally
worrisome.</p>
<p>“The Volt Typhoon malware enabled China to hide, among other things,
preoperational reconnaissance and network exploitation against critical
infrastructure,” Wray warned. “Steps China was taking, in other words,
to find and prepare to destroy or degrade the civilian critical
infrastructure that keeps us safe and prosperous.”</p>
<p>During Wednesday’s hearing in Washington, other top officials told
lawmakers the threat is already widespread, with China-linked hackers
having found their way into computer systems helping to run the energy,
water, transportation and aviation sectors.</p>
<p>“We’ve made it easy on them,” said CISA’s Easterly. “The truth is the
Chinese cyber actors have taken advantage of very basic flaws in our
technology.”</p>
<p>Easterly said that the U.S. must do more to adopt what she has called
a “secure by design” approach, to make sure both hardware and software
developers are conducting more rigorous testing to eliminate
vulnerabilities before their products go on the market.</p>
<p>Lawmakers shared in the alarm.</p>
<p>“This is the cyberspace equivalent of placing bombs on American
bridges, water treatment facilities and power plants,” said Committee
Chairman Mike Gallagher, a Republican.</p>
<p>“There is no economic benefit for these actions. There’s no pure
intelligence gathering rationale. The sole purpose is to be ready to
destroy American infrastructure,” he added.</p>
<p>Despite the multiple concerns, the outgoing commander of U.S. Cyber
Command told lawmakers the threat from Chinese hackers has not gone
unanswered.</p>
<p>“We are ready and postured to contest [the People’s Republic of
China’s] malicious activities at home and abroad,” said General Paul
Nakasone of U.S. Cyber Command.</p>
<p>Nakasone said that was especially true of the upcoming U.S.
presidential elections.</p>
<p>“I’m very confident in terms of what we will be able to deliver: a
safe and secure election,” he said.</p>
<p>“Americans can be confident in our election system and our
democracy,” the FBI’s Wray added, though he cautioned the threats from
China — and others — are growing.</p>
<p>“I am also mindful of the fact that our adversaries are getting more
sophisticated and that there are more and more foreign adversaries who
want to get in on this game,” he said.</p>
<p>Wray also voiced doubts about reports that Chinese government
officials have promised the U.S. they will not interfere in the
election.</p>
<p>“Well, China’s promised a lot of things over the years, so I guess
I’ll believe it when I see it,” he said.</p>
<p>One avenue for election interference of particular concern to
lawmakers is the social media network TikTok.</p>
<p>“If the CCP were to want to change TikTok feeds to bias one candidate
or another in the upcoming presidential election, would they be able to
do so?” asked Democratic Representative Seth Moulton.</p>
<p>Wray replied, “My understanding is that under Chinese law that would
be something they are permitted to do.”</p>
<p>When pressed on whether the U.S. should ban TikTok, Wray said such a
decision is “outside my lane.”</p>
<p>But he added, “As long as the Chinese government has the ability to
control all these aspects of the business, I don’t see how you get your
way clear to mitigating those concerns.”</p>
<p>Wednesday’s warnings build on a steady drumbeat of alerts from the
U.S. government on the threat China poses in cyberspace.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the FBI along with the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, and the Environmental
Protection Agency, or RPA, cautioned cyberattacks were posing “a real
and urgent risk to safe drinking water.”</p>
<p>CISA has also warned about threats from Chinese-manufactured drones,
warning they could access or steal sensitive information that could put
the U.S. security and health and safety at risk.</p>
<p>In September, Nakasone said he expected China to leverage artificial
intelligence, also known as AI, to impact the upcoming U.S. presidential
elections.</p>
<p>“Russia, China, others are going to try to use this technology,”
Nakasone told an audience in Washington.</p>

<h2 id="indieweb-carnival-digital-relationships">IndieWeb Carnival:
Digital Relationships</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
January is about to end. That means that January’s IndieWeb Carnival,
hosted by <a href="https://foreverliketh.is">foreverliketh.is</a>, is
also about to end. If you want to submit your entry on the topic of
<a href="https://foreverliketh.is/blog/indieweb-carnival-january-2024-positive-internalization/">Positive
Internalization</a> you should hurry up.
</p>
<p>
As mentioned previously on this blog I’m going to host the next month
and the topic for the month of February is going to be “Digital
relationships”. The meaning of the topic is intentionally vague but I
can think of at least three ways to interpret it.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The first is probably the most obvious: relationships between us human
beings that are lived primarily—or entirely—on the digital world.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The second is the relationship between us and the digital world itself.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The third is the growing trend of people having relationships with
digital creations such as AI fiends, boyfriends and girlfriends.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Those are three ways you can interpret the topic but don’t feel limited
to just those three. Go nuts and be creative. This site doesn’t have
pingbacks or webmentions so if you plan to participate send me a link to
your entry via email. I’m going to accept everything that’s sent to me
before March 1st and I plan to write at least one roundup post with your
links. Look forward to read your entries and don’t forget to spread the
word about the IndieWeb Carnival and if you want to get involved you can
still become a host yourself. Just claim your spot here

Yesterday the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA,
<a href="https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20240130/biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-help-communities-reduce" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a>
that it will help local governments pay to install solar panels and
energy-efficient appliances like heat pumps in public buildings such as
hospitals, fire stations, and schools in the wake of disasters. It’s a
move that will help those communities become more energy independent and
resilient, while also reducing the emissions that are intensifying
weather-related disasters to begin with. Last year saw a record 28
disaster costing $1 billion or more in the United States, according to
the agency, which added that buildings account for nearly 40% of U.S.
greenhouse gas emissions.

A new report from Human Rights Watch is an in-depth look at how
Louisiana’s hands-off approach to its fossil fuel industries has led to
devastating levels of cancer, birth defects, and respiratory ailments,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/louisiana-cancer-alley-human-rights" target="_self">writes</a>
my colleague Jacob Lambert in Heatmap.
</p>
<p>
“The failure of state and federal authorities to properly regulate the
industry has dire consequences for residents of Cancer Alley,” said
Antonia Juhasz, a senior researcher on fossil fuels at Human Rights
Watch. “It’s long past time for governments to uphold their human rights
obligations and for these sacrifices to end.”

<li>More than 4 million lives lost to climate change</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
We’ve long known that climate change impacts human lives, but putting a
number on just how many people it has affected so far is a difficult
task. A new analysis, published as commentary in the journal Nature
Medicine, tries to do just that, and arrives at a breathtaking figure:
at least 4 million people have been killed by climate change since 2000.
And as Zoya Teirstein writes in Grist, that’s
<a href="https://grist.org/health/climate-change-has-killed-4-million-people-since-2000-and-thats-an-underestimate/" target="_blank">probably
an underestimate</a>.
</p>
<p>
“Climate change is killing a lot of people, nobody is counting it, and
nobody is moving in the direction of counting it,” Colin Carlson, a
global change biologist and assistant professor at Georgetown University
who wrote the commentary, told Teirstein. “If it were anything but
climate change, we would be treating it on very different terms.”

<li>Truck makers team up for EV chargers<br/></li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
On Tuesday, the three largest heavy-duty truck makers in America —
Daimler Truck, Volkswagen subsidiary Navistar, and Volvo North America —
announced a new coalition called Powering America’s Commercial
Transportation that will advocate for governments and utilities to help
build more charging stations for electric trucks. There are only nine
charging stations in the country that can serve electric long-haulers,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/30/business/electric-vehicles-trucks.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writes</a>
Jack Ewing in The New York Times, and the truck companies argue that
without more support from federal and state governments they can’t
introduce more electric trucks to the market. This may, as Ewing notes,
also be a bit of a ploy to shift blame: earlier this month, more than 40
advocacy groups accused Daimler and Volvo of trying to get in the way of
stricter emissions regulations.

Pandora, the world’s largest jeweler, announced that it has stopped

estimates using recycled materials cuts the company’s indirect carbon

<h2 id="some-activities-are-harder-than-others">Some activities are
harder than others</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Some activities are harder than others
</h1>
<p>
Or, why <a href="2022-03-04_It_is_not_too_late_to_bake_bread">baking
bread</a> is easy compared to many other activities.
</p>
<p>
A recent conversation with
<a class="account" href="https://zirk.us/@Mayobrot" title="@Mayobrot@zirk.us"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Mayobrot">@Mayobrot</span></a> made me
think about the fear of doing things. I’m thinking that there are
activities that are inherently easier to perform than others because of
the natural environment. In speaking about them, however, we use
categories that do not differentiate between the two and so we transfer
our fears from one category to the other.
</p>
<p>
Here are some examples from my personal life: I think programming and
soldering and model planes are difficult activities because small
differences have big impacts. On the other hand, cooking or baking, or
taking care of plants are comparatively easy activities because small
differences often don’t have a large impact.
</p>
<p>
Take the question of how long you should bake bread. In my oven, with my
settings, it seems that anything between 30 min and 90 min results in
edible bread. The temperature can vary between 160°C and 220°C and if
I’m looking into the oven every now and then this results in edible
bread. Varying ingredients by ±10% and more results in edible bread.
</p>
<p>
The same is true for watering plants, potting plants and all that
connects to. Plants adapt. Errors don’t accumulate but instead they
average out. To much or too little water means it’s going to be OK on
average.
</p>
<p>
This is not how software works. Its bugs bugs bugs and they never
average out to a nice user experience.
</p>
<p>
When family asks me about bugs in programming, I tell them that the
problem is that we need to put everything into the program: gravity, air
resistance, the floor… In real life we don’t. Walking is easy because if
we push of harder we don’t yeet ourselves into the sun. We just bounce a
little higher and then we’re back on the ground. And we don’t fall
towards the centre of the Earth as in some 3d model glitch in a game.
No, the ground is always there. If we speed up, there’s friction to slow
us down again. So physics stabilizes many things.
</p>
<p>
Chemistry stabilizes many things, too. If we use up the oxygen in our
room, we don’t just go go go and then we die because the oxygen
concentration goes down slowly. We get less oxygen, we move slower, we
have more time to get out.
</p>
<p>
And biology stabilizes things, too. We call it homeostasis. You
exercise, burning up sugar. Sugar goes down, fat gets mobilized,
allowing your body to continue. And then there are a hundred feedback
loops for everything to keep your body from falling apart. Of course
eventually we all do, but still.
</p>
<p>
I guess what I really was trying to say is that there are some
activities like baking bread that seem hard because you think that
baking bread is probably related to model air-planes and if you struggle
with the tweezers and glue and all that, surely you will struggle with
the ingredients of that dish, too. But that is not so. Usually, you can
mess up ingredients pretty badly and results are still edible, or even
tasty! They might not be repeatable, but who cares if you’re not a chef
in a restaurant. It’s tasty and you eat it. It’s great.

Global shipper UPS announced Tuesday that it’s planning to eliminate
12,000 jobs over the next few months — most of them in management. While
shareholders love the phrases “trimming the fat,” “cutting costs” and
“right-sizing,” why are managers so often the targets? We’ll also hear
about a negated pay package for Elon Musk and the tough balancing act
for Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

What makes a Lotus, a Lotus? Anyone familiar with automotive history
would likely say it’s the coy “simplify, then add lightness” philosophy
that defined Colin Chapman’s scrappy sports car manufacturer and UK
Formula One legend. But last year, the company began shipping its
all-new electric SUV, the Eletre. It weighs 2600 kilograms. It’s built
in China. It has more settings than a high-end washing machine. It’s… an
SUV. Absolutely nothing about this car says “Lotus” — aside from the

<h2 id="cfpbs-proposed-data-rules">CFPB’s Proposed Data Rules</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, updated: 2024-01-26, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
In October, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
<a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb-1033-nprm-fr-notice_2023-10.pdf">proposed
a set of rules</a> that if implemented would transform how financial
institutions handle personal data about their customers. The rules put
control of that data back in the hands of ordinary Americans, while at
the same time undermining the data broker economy and increasing
customer choice and competition. Beyond these economic effects, the
rules have important data security benefits.
</p>
<p>
The CFPB’s rules align with a key security idea: the
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-privacy">decoupling
principle</a>. By separating which companies see what parts of our data,
and in what contexts, we can gain control over data about ourselves
(improving privacy) and harden cloud infrastructure against hacks
(improving security). Officials at the CFPB have described the new rules
as an attempt to accelerate a shift toward “open banking,” and after an
initial comment period on the new rules closed late last year, Rohit
Chopra, the CFPB’s director, …

<p>In the olden days with X11, you could just do x11-forwarding in SSH
and remote cut and paste would work. Now with Wayland, this is all
broken and supposedly “there are better ways of doing it”. One of those
is OSC52 support in terminals, but not in VTE based ones, like Tilix,
which is was my default terminal. (See
https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte/-/issues/2495 for the 5(!) year old
bug). So I wanted this to work, which meant changing terminal and
configuring Neovim - where the latter was way more complex, hard to
debug and reason about.</p>

Three AI insights for hard-charging, future-oriented smartypantses (31
Jan 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Three AI insights for hard-charging, future-oriented
smartypantses: A little bit of nonsensewatching for a Wednesday. Hey
look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009,
2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent
appearances, current writing projects, current reading Three AI insights
for hard-charging, future-oriented smartypantses (permalink) Living in
the age of AI hype makes demands on all of us to come up with
smartypants prognostications about how AI is about to change everything
forever, and wow, it’s pretty amazing, huh? AI pitchmen don’t make it
easy. They like to pile on the cognitive dissonance and demand that we
all somehow resolve it. This is a thing cult leaders do, too – tell
blatant and obvious lies to their followers. When a cult follower
repeats the lie to others, they are demonstrating their loyalty, both to
the leader and to themselves. Over and over, the claims of AI pitchmen
turn out to be blatant lies. This has been the case since at least the
age of the Mechanical Turk, the 18th century chess-playing automaton
that was actually just a chess player crammed into the base of an
elaborate puppet that was exhibited as an autonomous, intelligent robot.
The most prominent Mechanical Turk huckster is Elon Musk, who
habitually, blatantly and repeatedly lies about AI. He’s been promising
“full self driving” Telsas in “one to two years” for more than a decade.
Periodically, he’ll “demonstrate” a car that’s in full-self driving mode
– which then turns out to be a faked, recorded demo:
https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-video-promoting-self-driving-was-staged-engineer-testifies-2023-01-17/
Musk even trotted an autonomous, humanoid robot on-stage at an investor
presentation, failing to mention that this mechanical marvel was just a
person in a robot suit:
https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/elon-musk-tesla-robot-optimus-ai
Now, Musk has announced that his junk-science neural interface company,
Neuralink, has made the leap to implanting neural interface chips in a
human brain. As Joan Westenberg writes, the press have repeated this
claim as presumptively true, despite its wild implausibility:
https://joanwestenberg.com/blog/elon-musk-lies Neuralink, after all, is
a company notorious for mutilating primates in pursuit of showy,
meaningless demos:
https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-pcrm-neuralink-monkey-deaths/ I’m
perfectly willing to believe that Musk would risk someone else’s life to
help him with this nonsense, because he doesn’t see other people as real
and deserving of compassion or empathy. But he’s also profoundly lazy
and is accustomed to a world that unquestioningly swallows his most
outlandish pronouncements, so Occam’s Razor dictates that the most
likely explanation here is that he just made it up. The odds that
there’s a human being beta-testing Musk’s neural interface with the only
brain they will ever have aren’t zero. But I give it the same odds as
the Raelians’ claim to have cloned a human being:
https://edition.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/01/03/cf.opinion.rael/ The
human-in-a-robot-suit gambit is everywhere in AI hype. Cruise, GM’s
disgraced “robot taxi” company, had 1.5 remote operators for every one
of the cars on the road. They used AI to replace a single, low-waged
driver with 1.5 high-waged, specialized technicians. Truly, it was a
marvel. Globalization is key to maintaining the guy-in-a-robot-suit
phenomenon. Globalization gives AI pitchmen access to millions of
low-waged workers who can pretend to be software programs, allowing us
to pretend to have transcended the capitalism’s exploitation trap. This
is also a very old pattern – just a couple decades after the Mechanical
Turk toured Europe, Thomas Jefferson returned from the continent with
the dumbwaiter. Jefferson refined and installed these marvels,
announcing to his dinner guests that they allowed him to replace his
“servants” (that is, his slaves). Dumbwaiters don’t replace slaves, of
course – they just keep them out of sight:
https://www.stuartmcmillen.com/blog/behind-the-dumbwaiter/ So much AI
turns out to be low-waged people in a call center in the Global South
pretending to be robots that Indian techies have a joke about it: “AI
stands for ‘absent Indian’”:
https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/29/pay-no-attention/#to-the-little-man-behind-the-curtain
A reader wrote to me this week. They’re a multi-decade veteran of Amazon
who had a fascinating tale about the launch of Amazon Go, the “fully
automated” Amazon retail outlets that let you wander around, pick up
goods and walk out again, while AI-enabled cameras totted up the goods
in your basket and charged your card for them. According to this reader,
the AI cameras didn’t work any better than Tesla’s full-self driving
mode, and had to be backstopped by a minimum of three camera operators
in an Indian call center, “so that there could be a quorum system for
deciding on a customer’s activity – three autopilots good, two
autopilots bad.” Amazon got a ton of press from the launch of the Amazon
Go stores. A lot of it was very favorable, of course: Mister Market is
insatiably horny for firing human beings and replacing them with robots,
so any announcement that you’ve got a human-replacing robot is a
surefire way to make Line Go Up. But there was also plenty of critical
press about this – pieces that took Amazon to task for replacing human
beings with robots. What was missing from the criticism? Articles that
said that Amazon was probably lying about its robots, that it had
replaced low-waged clerks in the USA with even-lower-waged
camera-jockeys in India. Which is a shame, because that criticism would
have hit Amazon where it hurts, right there in the ole Line Go Up.
Amazon’s stock price boost off the back of the Amazon Go announcements
represented the market’s bet that Amazon would evert out of cyberspace
and fill all of our physical retail corridors with monopolistic robot
stores, moated with IP that prevented other retailers from similarly
slashing their wage bills. That unbridgeable moat would guarantee Amazon
generations of monopoly rents, which it would share with any
shareholders who piled into the stock at that moment. See the
difference? Criticize Amazon for its devastatingly effective automation
and you help Amazon sell stock to suckers, which makes Amazon executives
richer. Criticize Amazon for lying about its automation, and you clobber
the personal net worth of the executives who spun up this lie, because
their portfolios are full of Amazon stock:
https://sts-news.medium.com/youre-doing-it-wrong-notes-on-criticism-and-technology-hype-18b08b4307e5
Amazon Go didn’t go. The hundreds of Amazon Go stores we were promised
never materialized. There’s an embarrassing rump of 25 of these things
still around, which will doubtless be quietly shuttered in the years to
come. But Amazon Go wasn’t a failure. It allowed its architects to
pocket massive capital gains on the way to building generational wealth
and establishing a new permanent aristocracy of habitual bullshitters
dressed up as high-tech wizards. “Wizard” is the right word for it. The
high-tech sector pretends to be science fiction, but it’s usually
fantasy. For a generation, America’s largest tech firms peddled the
dream of imminently establishing colonies on distant worlds or even
traveling to other solar systems, something that is still so far in our
future that it might well never come to pass:
https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/09/astrobezzle/#send-robots-instead
During the Space Age, we got the same kind of performative bullshit. On
The Well David Gans mentioned hearing a promo on SiriusXM for a radio
show with “the first AI co-host.” To this, Craig L Maudlin replied,
“Reminds me of fins on automobiles.” Yup, that’s exactly it. An AI radio
co-host is to artificial intelligence as a Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz
tail-fin is to interstellar rocketry. Hey look at this (permalink) The

<h2 id="us-could-jail-foreign-officials-under-new-bribery-law">US Could
Jail Foreign Officials Under New Bribery Law</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Anticorruption activists around the world have high hopes
for a new U.S. law that for the first time allows Washington to
prosecute foreign officials who receive bribes.</p>
<p>The law broadens the enforcement profile of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, which has long been used to punish companies that pay
bribes and their shadowy agents.</p>
<p>Such players come from the “supply” side of the illicit payment
equation — those paying the bribes. The new Foreign Extortion Prevention
Act (FEPA) targets the “demand” side: foreign government officials who
seek or accept payouts.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden signed the measure into law in December as part
of a National Defense bill.</p>
<p>Auwal Musa Rafsanjani, a longtime anti-corruption and human rights
advocate in Nigeria, hopes the change instills “some level of fear” in
public officials who now feel “impunity,” he said.</p>
<p>“Public officials will engage in all sorts of corrupt practices and
they will never be punished for anything,” said Rafsanjani.</p>
<p>“Every employee for every foreign government is now going to be on
notice that the weight of the U.S. government could come after them,”
said Scott Greytak, a director of advocacy at Transparency
International. “That is going to change behavior.”</p>
<p>But Mike Koehler, a professor at Southern Illinois University School
of Law, said the deterrent benefit of the FCPA has long been
overstated.</p>
<p>Koehler considers the new measure “tokenism” and instead favors
greater transparency and encouragement of other countries to enforce
their own laws to reduce bribery.</p>
<p>Cold War statute</p>
<p>The FCPA was drafted in response to mid-1970s revelations of payments
by large U.S. companies to foreign officials that surfaced through the
Watergate investigations.</p>
<p>While barring U.S. companies from making such payments, the 1977 FCPA
statute, enacted during the Cold War, barred prosecution of officials
with foreign governments because of concerns it could hinder U.S.
diplomatic priorities.</p>
<p>Over time, the Justice Department has still managed to target corrupt
foreign officials under other statutes, such as money laundering.</p>
<p>Among the biggest FCPA cases in recent years, Goldman Sachs in
October 2020 paid $2.9 billion in a U.S. deferred prosecution agreement
over bribes to Malaysian and Abu Dhabi officials to win business.</p>
<p>Rafsanjani has pointed to a sprawling prosecution by the DOJ and
other countries of a four-company consortium that won some $6 billion in
contracts to build liquefied natural gas facilities in Bonny Island,
Nigeria.</p>
<p>The case included a $402 million criminal file on Halliburton unit
KBR in 2009. But Nigerian officials were not jailed in the case.</p>
<p>“What needs to be done is for countries like the U.S. to be in
alliance with other countries,” said Rafsanjani, who is working to
publicize FEPA within Nigerian agencies.</p>
<p>No quick fix</p>
<p>Research by Transparency International suggests the challenge in
countering corruption.</p>
<p>The group’s annual “Corruption Perceptions Index” released Tuesday
showed more than two-thirds of countries scoring below 50 due to poorly
financed enforcement and other governance ills. Nigeria scored 25 on the
scale, with 100 the best.</p>
<p>Foreign policy concerns could continue to dissuade prosecutions even
with FEPA, note legal experts, who also say enforcement will be
difficult if governments are unwilling to extradite defendants.</p>
<p>Supporters of FEPA see it as a way to make fighting corruption a
priority. The law requires the Justice Department to report annually on
the frequency of bribes and its enforcement record.</p>
<p>FEPA puts fighting corruption “front and center,” said Patrick
Stokes, who prosecuted the Bonny Island case while at DOJ and now is a
partner at Gibson Dunn.</p>
<p>“As a practical matter the new statute only marginally expands DOJ’s
tools for going after corruption,” he said, noting that money laundering
laws can be used to prosecute foreign officials.</p>
<p>“The statue may have real deterrence value by making clearer to
foreign officials that they can be prosecuted for soliciting and
accepting bribes,” Stokes said.</p>
<p>Jason Linder, a former U.S. prosecutor who now works at Mayer Brown,
said the demand side “has remained robust because corruption is endemic
in some countries,” and existing enforcement in developed countries only
reaches a “very small percentage of corrupt conduct.”</p>
<p>While FEPA is a “very constructive step,” Linder said, “it remains to
be seen how DOJ will enforce it.”</p>
<p>Success, he said, will have to be measured “over the coming decades,
not just the next few years.”</p>

id="musk-cannot-keep-tesla-pay-package-worth-more-than-55-billion-judge-rules">Musk
Cannot Keep Tesla Pay Package Worth More Than $55 Billion, Judge
Rules</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DOVER, Del. — Elon Musk is not entitled to a landmark compensation
package awarded by Tesla’s board of directors that is potentially worth
more than $55 billion, a Delaware judge ruled Tuesday.</p>
<p>The ruling by Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick comes more than
five years after a shareholder lawsuit targeted Tesla CEO Musk and
directors of the company. They were accused of breaching their duties to
the maker of electric vehicles and solar panels, resulting in a waste of
corporate assets and unjust enrichment for Musk.</p>
<p>The shareholder’s lawyers argued that the compensation package should
be voided because it was dictated by Musk and was the product of sham
negotiations with directors who were not independent of him. They also
said it was approved by shareholders who were given misleading and
incomplete disclosures in a proxy statement.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys countered that the pay plan was fairly negotiated
by a compensation committee whose members were independent, contained
performance milestones so lofty that they were ridiculed by some Wall
Street investors, and blessed by a shareholder vote that was not even
required under Delaware law. They also argued that Musk was not a
controlling shareholder because he owned less than one-third of the
company at the time.</p>
<p>An attorney for Musk and other Tesla defendants did not immediately
respond to an email seeking comment.</p>
<p>But Musk reacted to the ruling on X, the social media platform
formerly known as Twitter that he owns, by offering business advice.
“Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware,” he said. He
later added, “I recommend incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer
shareholders to decide matters.”</p>
<p>Musk, who as of Tuesday topped Forbes’ list of the world’s richest
people, had earlier this month challenged Tesla’s board to come up with
a new compensation plan for him that would give him a 25% stake in the
company. On an earnings call last week, Musk, who holds 13%, explained
that with a 25% stake, he can’t control the company, yet he would have
strong influence.</p>
<p>In trial testimony in November 2022, Musk denied that he dictated
terms of the compensation package or attended any meetings at which the
plan was discussed by the board, its compensation committee, or a
working group that helped develop it.</p>
<p>McCormick determined, however, that because Musk was a controlling
shareholder with a potential conflict of interest, the pay package must
be subject to a more rigorous standard.</p>
<p>“The process leading to the approval of Musk’s compensation plan was
deeply flawed,” McCormick wrote in the colorfully written 200-page
decision. “Musk had extensive ties with the persons tasked with
negotiating on Tesla’s behalf.”</p>
<p>McCormick concluded that the only suitable remedy was for Musk’s
compensation package to be rescinded.</p>
<p>Greg Varallo, a lead attorney for the shareholder plaintiff, praised
McCormick’s decision to reverse the “absurdly outsized” Musk pay
package.</p>
<p>“The fact that they lost this in Delaware court, it’s a jaw dropper,”
said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. “It’s unprecedented, a ruling
like this. I think going in investors thought it was just typical legal
noise and nothing was going to come out about it. The fact that they
went head-to-head with Tesla and Musk and the board and voided this,
it’s a huge legal decision.”</p>
<p>During his trial testimony, Musk downplayed the notion that his
friendships with certain Tesla board members, including sometimes
vacationing together, meant that they were likely to do his bidding.</p>
<p>The plan called for Musk to reap billions if Tesla, which is based in
Austin, Texas, hit certain market capitalization and operational
milestones. For each incidence of simultaneously meeting a market cap
milestone and an operational milestone, Musk, who owned about 22% of
Tesla when the plan was approved, would get stock equal to 1% of
outstanding shares at the time of the grant. His interest in the company
would grow to about 28% if the company’s market capitalization grew by
$600 billion.</p>
<p>Tesla has achieved all 12 market capitalization milestones and 11
operational milestones, providing Musk nearly $28 billion in stock
option gains, according to a January post-trial brief filed by the
plaintiff’s attorneys. The stock option grants are subject to a
five-year holding period, however.</p>
<p>Defense attorney Evan Chesler argued at trial that the compensation
package was a “high-risk, high-reward” deal that benefited not just
Musk, but Tesla shareholders. After the plan was implemented, the value
of the company, based in Austin, Texas, climbed from $53 billion to more
than $800 billion, having briefly hit $1 trillion.</p>

id="kimchi-consumption-grows-thanks-to-k-content-health-claims">Kimchi
Consumption Grows, Thanks to K-Content, Health Claims</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — South Korean kimchi exports hit a record high amid a
global surge in the popularity of Korean culture, hitting 44,041 tons in
2023, a 7.1% increase from 42,544 tons exported in 2021. </p>
<p>Kimchi, a traditional Korean dish made by fermenting cabbage or other
vegetables, was exported to 92 countries from South Korea last year,
with the United States and Japan being the top customers, according to
BusinessKorea, a monthly magazine.  </p>
<p>The United States imported more than 10,000 tons of kimchi in 2023,
and Japan imported more than 20,000 tons. Kimchi exports to the United
States have grown significantly in the past few years, increasing from
$14.8 million in 2019 to $29 million in 2022, according to The Korea
Daily. </p>
<p>Some experts see a connection between this rise in exports and the
rising popularity of Korean entertainment content, such as K-pop and
K-dramas. According to Forbes, U.S. viewership of Korean dramas rose
200% from 2019 to 2021, with TV shows like “Squid Game” topping the
Netflix viewership charts in the United States.  </p>
<p>Others attribute the rising popularity of kimchi to its health
benefits, as fermented foods expand the diversity of digestive tract
microbes.  </p>
<p>Patrice Cunningham, founder and CEO of Tae-Gu Kimchi in Washington,
spoke about the increase in popularity of kimchi in the United
States. </p>
<p>“Kimchi is a huge part of the Korean diet,” she said. “They eat it as
a side dish with almost every meal. … In the states now, we’re kind of
implementing that same style of eating.”  </p>
<p>Cunningham makes and distributes kimchi with her mother, selling both
vegan and non-vegan varieties made from napa cabbage.  </p>
<p>“I always knew that my mom had a really great kimchi recipe, and I
remember saying to myself for a while that I wanted to bottle it one day
and sell it,” Cunningham said.  </p>
<p>She attends 15 to 16 farmers markets a week in the main season and
has won multiple grants for her business, contributing to its
growth. </p>
<p>She said many of their customers focus on their “gut health … and so
they buy our kimchi for that.”   </p>
<p>K-culture boosts popularity</p>
<p>Another Washington business that sells kimchi is Rice Market. Partner
Sak Pollert said kimchi sales have increased significantly over the past
two years.  </p>
<p>He said more customers come in “with recipes on their phone, looking
for Korean and other Asian ingredients, too.”   </p>
<p>As to kimchi’s rise in popularity, particularly in the United States,
Pollert said that many in Washington are world travelers already
familiar with kimchi but don’t like the smell.  </p>
<p>“But now, they learned it’s probiotic foods that taste good and help
with digestion,” he said. “It helps make other foods taste better, so
they get over the smell quickly.”  </p>
<p>Pollert said he thinks that K-content has played an important role in
bolstering kimchi’s global popularity. K-dramas “did a phenomenal job
promoting kimchi and Korean food and drinks, especially soju,” a Korean
grain-based alcohol.  </p>
<p>He noted that restaurant and dinner scenes in many K-dramas feature
ajummas — Korean for married or middle-aged women — gathering around a
table to gossip and make kimchi before winter.  </p>
<p>South Korea promotes its cuisine </p>
<p>This rise in popularity of kimchi, though influenced by multiple
factors, is a part of a broader plan by the South Korean government to
push Korean cuisine worldwide.  </p>
<p>“South Korea’s government and corporations are thinking of ways to
promote Korean food and profit from it,” National Public Radio’s Anthony
Kuhn said in an interview with Yang Joo-Pil, an official at the South
Korean Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs.  </p>
<p>Yang said that each year, about 10 food items are chosen for product
placement in popular dramas, and Korean foods are sold at K-pop
concerts. </p>
<p>In Washington, efforts to promote Korean food and spread Korean
culture are evident in the work of the Korean Cultural Center. Last
November, the center partnered with Tae-Gu Kimchi for “DC’s First
Kimjang: Making and Sharing Kimchi.”  </p>
<p>Kimjang in Korea is an event that occurs once or twice a year “as a
way for communities to collectively stock up on and share essential
foods,” according to the Korean Cultural Center’s event page.  </p>
<p>At the kimjang event, participants had the opportunity to try kimchi
over rice and make their own kimchi in a hands-on workshop.</p>

<h2 id="iran-wary-of-us-response-after-deadly-attack-on-troops">Iran
Wary of US Response After Deadly Attack on Troops</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Tehran, Iran — Iranian commentators warned Tuesday of a U.S. military
retaliation after Washington pledged a “very consequential” response to
troop deaths, but largely agreed that a full-blown war was not in the
offing.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden blamed “radical Iran-backed militant groups
operating in Syria and Iraq” for Sunday’s drone strike on a remote
Jordan desert base near Syria and Iraq that killed three U.S.
soldiers.</p>
<p>The first American military deaths in an attack since the October 7
outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war have ratcheted up tensions between the
long-time enemies at the start of a U.S. election year.</p>
<p>Longtime foes Washington and Tehran have both been at pains to stress
they do not want war, so Biden’s warning has left Iranians guessing
about the next move.</p>
<p>“The possibility that Biden will order direct attacks on Iranian
targets cannot be ignored,” political analyst Ahmad Zeidabadi wrote in
the Ham-Mihan newspaper.</p>
<p>But he said any U.S. attacks would more likely target “the bases of
Iranian forces in other countries.”</p>
<p>In a sign of heightened tensions, Iran’s rial slipped Tuesday to an
all-time low of around 580,000 to 600,000 to the U.S. dollar on the
black market.</p>
<p>The reformist Etemaad Daily newspaper also said it was “possible” the
Biden administration — under political pressure from the Republicans —
“will target limited but strategic targets inside Iran.”</p>
<p>“This scenario may spell the end of diplomatic efforts between Tehran
and Washington,” it said.</p>
<p>Some of Biden’s Republican rivals have urged a direct attack on Iran,
while the president said Tuesday that “a wider war in the Middle East”
was “not what I’m looking for.”</p>
<p>Iranian officials were quick to deny any links to the Jordan attack,
reiterating that Tehran also opposes an “expansion” of the conflict in
the region.</p>
<p>Warning against ‘vengeance’</p>
<p>Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said Tuesday the
solution to the crisis must be “political” and wrote on X that
“diplomacy is active in this direction.”</p>
<p>China and Russia, which have friendly ties with Iran, urged
de-escalation and restraint, and Beijing warned against a “cycle of
retaliation” in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Another reformist newspaper, Shargh, called a direct confrontation
“unlikely” and said “Tehran and Washington have already shown in the
past their ability to contain direct conflicts.”</p>
<p>The Iran Daily, in a more strongly worded editorial, warned that
Biden must “not be duped into a direct military attack on Iran to take
vengeance for a strike launched by a third party.”</p>
<p>“Any insane move will definitely instigate a proportionate response
from Iran which could lead to a full-blown war,” it said.</p>
<p>The United States and Iran have been bitter enemies since the 1979
Islamic Revolution.</p>
<p>Fears about Iran’s nuclear program have since led to punishing
international sanctions, while U.S. ally Israel has fought a shadow war
of killings and sabotage with Iran.</p>
<p>The United States and Israel accuse Iran-backed militant groups of
fighting proxy wars in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen, with the support
of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.</p>
<p>In 2020, former U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the killing of
revered Guards commander Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad.</p>
<p>Violence across the region has spiked since Palestinian militant
group Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, sparking the bloodiest-ever
Gaza war.</p>
<p>Iran has voiced support for Hamas and its allies — Hezbollah in
Lebanon and Yemen’s Houthis — but insisted that the militant groups are
acting independently.</p>
<p>It has also accused the United States of being an accomplice to
Israel’s “genocide” in Gaza.</p>
<p>British ambassador summoned</p>
<p>The killings in Jordan follow a spate of attacks on U.S. forces in
nearby Iraq and Syria, many claimed by the Iran-backed alliance Islamic
Resistance in Iraq.</p>
<p>Tehran on Tuesday summoned the British ambassador to protest an
unspecified “accusation” against the Islamic republic, after London said
Iran-aligned groups were behind the Jordan attack.</p>
<p>Britain, along with the United States, also imposed sanctions on a
network they allege targets Iranian dissidents.</p>
<p>Washington has repeatedly accused Iran of involvement in Red Sea
attacks by Houthi rebels and of “actively facilitating” attacks on U.S.
forces in other parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations, Amir Saeid Iravani, again
stressed Tehran’s position in a letter published by the official IRNA
news agency.</p>
<p>He wrote that no group affiliated with Iran’s armed forces, “whether
in Iraq, Syria or elsewhere … operates directly or indirectly under the
control of the Islamic Republic of Iran or acts on its behalf.”</p>
<p>The Etemaad newspaper judged that Washington “has no choice but to
increase pressure” on Israel to end the Gaza war.</p>
<p>The conservative Javan newspaper warned that U.S. involvement in a
regional conflict to support Israel would be a “perfect example of
betting on a losing horse.”</p>

<h2 id="pgbouncer-1.22.0-released">PgBouncer 1.22.0 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
PgBouncer 1.22.0 has been released. The main feature this release adds
is support for the <code>DISCARD ALL</code> and <code>DEALLOCATE
ALL</code> commands when enabling prepared statement support in
transaction pooling mode (by setting
<code>max_prepared_statements</code> to a non-zero value). This is an
important improvement in the prepared statement support that clears the
road for us to be able to enable prepared statement support by default
in a future release.
</p>
<p>
Other than that this release contains some small improvements and
bugfixes, including improvements to our recommended SystemD
configuration files.
</p>
<p>

for more information, the detailed changelog, and download links.

<p>
PgBouncer is a lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL.

<h2 id="vis-for-vi-and-fun">vis for vi and fun</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: Robert’s Ramblings</p>
<p>I’ve been looking for a <code>vi</code> editor that my fingers would
be happy with. I learned <code>vi</code> when I first encountered Unix
in University (1980s). I was a transfer student so didn’t get the
“introduction to Unix and Emacs” lecture. Everyone used Emacs to edit
programs but Emacs to me was not intuitive. I recall having a heck of a
time figuring out how to exit the editor! I knew I needed to learn an
editor and Unix fast to do my school work. I head to my college
bookstore and found two spiral bound books <a
href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL8724416W?edition=key%3A/books/OL24392296M">Unix
in a Nutshell</a> and “Vi/Ed in a Nutshell”. They helped remedy my
ignorance. I spent the afternoon getting comfortable with Unix and
learning the basics in Vi. It became my go to text editor. Somewhere
along the line <code>nvi</code> came along I used that. Eventually
<code>vim</code> replaced <code>nvi</code> as the default “vi” for most
Linux system and adapted again. I like one featured about
<code>vim</code> over <code>nvi</code>. <code>vim</code> does syntax
highlighting. I routinely get frustrate with <code>vim</code> (my old
muscle memory throws me into the help systems, very annoying) so I tend
to bounce between <code>nvi</code> and <code>vim</code> depending on how
my eyes feel and frustration level.</p>
<p>Recently I stumbled on <code>vis</code>. I find it a very interesting
<code>vi</code> implementation. Like <code>vim</code> it mostly conforms
to the classic mappings of a modal editor built on top of
<code>ed</code>. But <code>vis</code> has some nice twists. First it
doesn’t try to be a monolithic systems like Emacs or <code>vim</code>.
Rather then used an application specific scripting language
(e.g. Emacs-lisp, vim-script) it uses Lua 5.2 as its configuration
language. For me starting up <code>vis</code> feels like starting up
<code>nvi</code>. It is quick and responsive where my typical
<code>vim</code> setup feels allot like Visual Studio Code in that it’s
loading a whole bunch of things I don’t use.</p>
<p>Had <code>vis</code> just had syntax highlighting I don’t know if I
was would switched from <code>vim</code>. <code>neovim</code> is a
better vim but I don’t use it regularly and don’t go out of my way to
install it. <code>vis</code> has one compelling feature that pushed me
over the edge. One I didn’t expect. <code>vis</code> supports <a
href="http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/structural_regexps/se.pdf"
title="PDF paper explain structured regular expression by Rob Pike">structured
regular expressions</a>. This is the command language found in Plan 9
editors like <a href="http://sam.cat-v.org/">sam</a> and <a
href="http://acme.cat-v.org/">Acme</a>. The approach to regexp is
oriented around streams of characters rather than lines of characters.
It does this by supporting the concept of multiple cursors and operating
on selections (note the plural) in parallel. This allows a higher degree
of transformation, feels like a stream oriented AWK but with simpler
syntax for the things you do all the time. It was easiest enough to
learn that my finger quickly adapted to it. It does mean that in command
mode my search and replace is different than what I used to type. E.g.
changing CRLF to LF</p>
<pre><code>:1,$x/\r/ c//</code></pre>
<p>versus …</p>

January 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: Redox OS News</p>
<p>This is the first in hopefully a regular series of posts about the
progress we have made on Redox this month. We have been remiss in
keeping you up to date on our progress, but this is an attempt to
improve the situation. Since the last news post on our progress, there
have several major accomplishments and many smaller ones. Forgive us if
a few are left out. Request for Donations With all the exciting
accomplishments of our contributors, it’s hard to believe that Redox is
getting by on only a few hundred dollars per month in donations.</p>
