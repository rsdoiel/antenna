<p>Lawmakers are trying to ban a Chinese company on “surveillance”
grounds to benefit American competitors powering U.S. police

<p>
[<a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-piledrive-you-if-you-mention-ai-again/">Nikhil
Suresh at Ludicity</a>]
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“This entire class of person is, to put it simply, abhorrent to
right-thinking people. They’re an embarrassment to people that are
actually making advances in the field, a disgrace to people that know
how to sensibly use technology to improve the world, and are also a
bunch of tedious know-nothing bastards that should be thrown into
Thought Leader Jail until they’ve learned their lesson, a prison I’m
fundraising for.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I enjoyed this very much.
</p>
<p>
Here’s the thing, though: I don’t think what Nikhil wants will happen.
</p>
<p>
I mean, don’t get me wrong: it probably <em>should</em>. The author is a
leader in his field, and his exasperation at the hype train is
well-earned.
</p>
<p>
But it’s not people like Nikhil who actually make the decisions, or
invest in the companies, or make the whole industry (or industries) tick
over. Again: it should be.
</p>
<p>
What happens again and again is that people who see that they can make
money out of a particularly hyped technology leap onto the bandwagon,
and then market the bandwagon within an inch of everybody’s lives. Stuff
that shouldn’t be widespread becomes widespread.
</p>
<p>
And here we are again with AI.
</p>
<p>
This is exactly right:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Unless you are one of a tiny handful of businesses who know exactly
what they’re going to use AI for, you do not need AI for anything - or
rather, you do not need to do anything to reap the benefits. Artificial
intelligence, as it exists and is useful now, is probably already baked
into your businesses software supply chain.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“It did not end up being the crazy productivity booster that I thought
it would be, because programming is designing and these tools aren’t
good enough (yet) to assist me with this seriously.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There is work that will be improved with AI, but it’s not something that
most industries will have to stop everything and leap on top of. The
human use cases must come first with any technology: if you have a
problem that AI can solve, by all means, use AI. But if you don’t,
hopping on the hype train is just going to burn you a lot of money and
slow your actual core business down.

<p>date: 2024-06-20, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
In the U.S., the Federal Reserve has decided to keep rates elevated for
a year now. The Fed’s goal is to hit a 2% inflation target, but that
last mile has been difficult. And part of it has to do with how we are
able to lock in debt at times of lower rates in the U.S. We’ll discuss.
We’ll also hear about RV sales, then the Europe and China’s tit-for-tat
trade battle.

Today marks the summer solstice, the longest day of the year here in the
Northern Hemisphere and the official start of summer 2024. With global
temperatures still at record highs, what we’re experiencing now is
probably just a preview of what’s to come in the following months and
years. “These days I think it’s much more appropriate to call it ‘global
weirding’” than global warming, climate professor

<li>Warm temperatures send U.S. power generation soaring
</h3>
<p>
The warm temperatures across the U.S. are driving up power generation
and putting a strain on the grid. Natural gas-fired power generation is
up 6% so far this year compared to 2023, and in fact is at its highest
since 2021, <em>Reuters</em>
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-power-system-cranks-up-gas-output-cooling-season-kicks-off-maguire-2024-06-20/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9ddtUhySUPNHKQt7mhowG-VAeLA_S7HVC4CbVe3QsrpWZMk43suS88HOc9TPZK0cg6i9mS" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.
While clean power output is also set to rise, natural gas is expected to
remain the top fuel source in the U.S. “In turn, U.S. power sector
emissions from gas use will likely also climb to new highs in 2024,
potentially accelerating the climate warming trends that are fuelling
increased higher gas demand in the first place,”
<em><em>Reuters</em></em> added. The heat wave sweeping east prompted
New England’s power grid operator to declare a level 1 emergency this
week, and briefly pushed electricity prices up near $2,000 per
megawatt-hour, “more than 10 times the day-ahead cost for the hour,”
<em><em>Bloomberg</em></em>

report from the Energy Institute</a>. Coal demand rose, oil consumption
“rebounded strongly” after a pandemic dip, and crude oil consumption
exceeded 100 million barrels per day for the first time ever. As a
result, greenhouse gas emissions increased 2.1% and broke the record set
the year before. Emissions from energy have increased by 50% since the
year 2000, the report found. At the same time, renewable power
generation reached a record high last year and accounted for about 15%
of the global energy mix, and fossil fuel consumption for energy dropped
ever so slightly (by 0.4%). The report sheds light on huge regional
contrasts: “In advanced economies, we observe signs of demand for fossil
fuels peaking, contrasting with economies in the Global South for whom
economic development and improvements in quality of life continue to
drive fossil growth,” Energy Institute Chief Executive Nick Wayth

<p>
Cannabis is now legal — for medical or recreational use — in 38 states,
plus D.C. But marijuana remains illegal at the federal level, meaning
there are stringent rules governing the transportation of cannabis. That
can leave some parts of the industry stranded, sometimes on literal
islands. Today, we travel to Martha’s Vineyard to hear how those hurdles
have impacted one dispensary. Plus, a look at fossil fuel use and the
effort to reopen a criminal case against Boeing.

id="south-africa-beats-us-in-super-eight-playoffs-at-the-t20-world-cup">South
Africa beats US in Super Eight playoffs at the T20 World Cup</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NORTH SOUND, Antigua — South Africa had to work hard to earn an
18-run win over the fast-improving United States in the opening game of
the Super Eight at the Twenty20 World Cup on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Co-host the West Indies also lost it first match in the Super Eight
stage Wednesday, beaten by eight wickets by defending champion England.
Jack Salt scored 87 runs to lead England.</p>
<p>Andries Gous made an unbeaten 80 off 47 balls for the U.S. — against
the country of his birth — to move atop the batting charts at the World
Cup before South Africa restricted the Americans at 176-6.</p>
<p>Fast bowler Kagiso Rabada claimed 3-18 and spinner Keshav Maharaj got
the prized wicket of U.S. captain Aaron Jones for a duck — no runs — to
finish with 1-24.</p>
<p>Quinton de Kock had earlier made a rampant 74 off 40 balls and
Heinrich Klaasen provided the perfect finish with 36 not out in the
South African total of 194-4 after Jones won the toss and elected to
field.</p>
<p>“Pretty happy with the performance as a whole,” South Africa captain
Aiden Markram said. “A couple of overs here and there we need to tidy up
… but the wicket definitely changes and gets a bit slower.”</p>
<p>De Kock and Markram (46 off 32 balls) dominated both spinners and the
pacers as they raised a solid 110-run stand after Saurabh Netravalkar
(2-21) had provided the early breakthrough by getting the wicket of
Reeza Hendricks in his second over.</p>
<p>“We’ve had some tricky wickets so it was nice to spend some time in
the middle today,” de Kock said. “The USA put us under pressure towards
the end. It was a great game.”</p>
<p>Netravalkar, who bowled a sensational Super Over in the United
States’ historic win over heavyweights Pakistan in the group stage,
struck immediately in his return spell when Markram was brilliantly
caught by diving Ali Khan at deep backward point off a full-pitched
ball.</p>
<p>But Klaasen used all his T20 experience in the last five overs and
struck three sixes while Tristan Stubbs also hit two fours in his
16-ball unbeaten 20 which lifted the South Africa total.</p>
<p>“Hard to take a defeat after coming so close,” Jones said. “We did
lack discipline in the bowling at times, (but) once we play good cricket
we can beat any team in the world. We need to be a lot more
disciplined.”</p>
<p>England beats the West Indies</p>
<p>At Gros Islet, St Lucia, Salt carried his bat for 87 and Jonny
Bairstow made an unbeaten 48 as defending champion England beat the West
Indies by eight wickets in a match between two-time World Cup
champions.</p>
<p>It was the West Indies’ first loss of the tournament and their first
defeat in eight Twenty20 internationals.</p>
<p>The West Indies made 180-4 batting first on the same pitch on which
they made 218-5 against Afghanistan in the final match of the group
stage on Monday.</p>
<p>The fireworks came at the end and from England as Salt made his 87
runs from 47 balls with seven fours and five sixes and Bairstow added
his 48 from 26 deliveries. England reached 181-2 with 15 balls to
spare.</p>
<p>Salt provided a solid foundation for the England run chase, initially
in a 67-run opening partnership with Jos Buttler.</p>
<p>Salt scored 30 runs — three sixes and three fours — from the 16th
over bowled by Romario Shepherd.</p>
<p>“I’m not looking too far ahead at the minute, just glad that I could
contribute to a good team win,” Salt said. “It was a little bit tougher
in the middle overs with the spin.”</p>
<p>The pitch may have been a little slower than on Monday but England
captain Buttler also used his bowlers well and the West Indies innings
included 50 dot balls.</p>
<p>A capacity crowd in the first night match of the Super Eight stage
was out to party but the match really didn’t come alive until the
end.</p>
<p>The West Indies started well but were disrupted in the six-over power
play by the loss of Brandon King who retired hurt after 4.3 overs with a
side or groin strain. King had just hit the first six of the match, a
103-meter (338-foot) blow that flew over the grandstand and out of the
stadium.</p>
<p>He made 23 from 13 balls and was setting the early pace of the
innings when he was forced to retire with the West Indies at 40-0. There
was no immediate word on the seriousness of King’s injury.</p>
<p>“Credit has to be given to the England bowling unit. You can see they
had clear plans and executed them well,” West Indies captain Rovman
Powell said.</p>

of Boeing MAX crash victims seek nearly $25 billion fine,
prosecution</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Families of Boeing 737 MAX crash victims on Wednesday
asked U.S. authorities to impose a fine of up to $24.8 billion on the
aviation giant and proceed with criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>The move comes a day after Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun acknowledged the
gravity of the company’s safety problems and assured a U.S.
congressional panel that it was making progress on the issue.</p>
<p>Sitting behind him in the audience were relatives of victims of the
Boeing 737 MAX 8 crashes in 2018 and 2019, who held up victims’
photos.</p>
<p>“Because Boeing’s crime is the deadliest corporate crime in U.S.
history, a maximum fine of more than $24 billion is legally justified
and clearly appropriate,” Paul Cassell, a lawyer for the families, wrote
in a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>
<p>The 32-page document explains the calculations behind the amount
sought, saying Boeing “should be fined the maximum — $24,780,000,000 —
with perhaps $14,000,000,000 to $22,000,0000,000 of the fine suspended
on the condition that Boeing devote those suspended funds to an
independent corporate monitor and related improvements in compliance and
safety programs as identified below.”</p>
<p>It added: “And Boeing’s Board of Directors should be ordered to meet
with the families.”</p>
<p>The families also believe the government should promptly “launch
criminal prosecutions of the responsible corporate officials at Boeing
at the time of the two crashes.”</p>
<p>The case relates to crashes in 2018 and 2019 in Indonesia and
Ethiopia that together claimed 346 lives and comes as Boeing faces
intensifying scrutiny following recent manufacturing and safety
problems.</p>
<p>The aviation giant has again been in the public spotlight since a
January 5 incident in which a 737 MAX operated by Alaska Airlines was
forced to make an emergency landing after a fuselage panel blew out
midflight.</p>

id="louisiana-requires-public-school-classrooms-to-display-ten-commandments">Louisiana
requires public school classrooms to display Ten Commandments</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BATON ROUGE, Louisiana — Louisiana has become the first U.S. state to
require that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every public school
classroom, the latest move from a Republican-dominated legislature
pushing a conservative agenda under a new governor. </p>
<p>The legislation that Republican Governor Jeff Landry signed into law
on Wednesday requires a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in
“large, easily readable font” in all public classrooms, from
kindergarten to state-funded universities. </p>
<p>Opponents questioned the law’s constitutionality and vowed to
challenge it in court. Proponents said the measure is not solely
religious, but that it has historical significance. In the language of
the law, the Ten Commandments are “foundational documents of our state
and national government.” </p>
<p>The posters, which will be paired with a four-paragraph “context
statement” describing how the Ten Commandments “were a prominent part of
American public education for almost three centuries,” must be in place
in classrooms by the start of 2025. </p>
<p>Under the law, state funds will not be used to implement the mandate.
The posters would be paid for through donations. </p>
<p>The law also “authorizes” but does not require the display of other
items in K-12 public schools, including: The Mayflower Compact, which
was signed by religious pilgrims aboard the Mayflower in 1620 and is
often referred to as America’s “First Constitution”; the Declaration of
Independence; and the Northwest Ordinance, which established a
government in the Northwest Territory — in the present day Midwest — and
created a pathway for admitting new states to the Union. </p>
<p>Opponents vow to challenge law</p>
<p>Not long after the governor signed the bill into law at Our Lady of
Fatima Catholic School in Lafayette on Wednesday, civil rights groups
and organizations that want to keep religion out of government promised
to file a lawsuit challenging it. </p>
<p>The law prevents students from getting an equal education and will
keep children who have different beliefs from feeling safe at school,
the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of
Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said in a
joint statement Wednesday afternoon. </p>
<p>“Even among those who may believe in some version of the Ten
Commandments, the particular text that they adhere to can differ by
religious denomination or tradition. The government should not be taking
sides in this theological debate,” the groups said. </p>
<p>The controversial law, in a state ensconced in the Bible Belt, comes
during a new era of conservative leadership in Louisiana under Landry,
who replaced two-term Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards in January.
Republicans hold a supermajority in the legislature, and Republicans
hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to
push through a conservative agenda. </p>
<p>Similar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in
classrooms have been proposed in other states, including Texas, Oklahoma
and Utah. However, with threats of legal battles over the
constitutionality of such measures, no state besides Louisiana has
succeeded in making the bills law. </p>
<p>Similar law ruled unconstitutional</p>
<p>Legal battles over the display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms
are not new. </p>
<p>In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was
unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S.
Constitution, which says Congress can “make no law respecting an
establishment of religion.”  </p>
<p>The high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather
served a plainly religious purpose.</p>

<h2 id="the-exectos-operating-system">The ExectOS operating system</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>ExectOS is a preemptive, reentrant multitasking operating system that
implements the XT architecture which derives from NT architecture. It is
modular, and consists of two main layers: microkernel and user modes.
Its’ kernel mode has full access to the hardware and system resources
and runs code in a protected memory area. It consists of executive
services, which is itself made up on many modules that do specific
tasks, a kernel and drivers. Unlike the NT, system does not feature a
separate Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) between the physical hardware
and the rest of the OS. Instead, XT architecture integrates a hardware
specific code with the kernel. The user mode is made up of subsystems
and it has been designed to run applications written for many different
types of operating systems. This allows us to implement any environment
subsystem to support applications that are strictly written to the
corresponding standard (eg. DOS, or POSIX). Thanks to that ExectOS will
allow to run existing software, including Win32 applications. ↫ ExectOS
website What ExectOS seems to be is an implementation very close to what
Windows NT originally was – implementing the theory of Windows NT, not
the reality. It’s clearly still in very early development, but in
theory, I really like the idea of what they’re trying to achieve here.
Windows NT is, after all, in and of itself not a bad concept – it’s just
been tarred and feathered by decades of mismanagement from Microsoft.
Implementing something that closely resembles the original, minimalist
theories behind NT could lead to an interesting operating system for
sure. ExectOS is open source, contains its own boot loader, only runs on
EFI, and installation on real hardware, while technically possible, is
discouraged.</p>

<h2 id="the-x-windowing-system-turns-40-today">The X Windowing System
turns 40 today</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today just so happens to be the 40th birthday of X, the venerable
windowing system that’s on its way out, at least in the Linux world.
From the original announcement by Robert W. Scheifler: I’ve spent the
last couple weeks writing a window system for the VS100. I stole a fair
amount of code from W, surrounded it with an asynchronous rather than a
synchronous interface, and called it X. Overall performance appears to
be about twice that of W. The code seems fairly solid at this point,
although there are still some deficiencies to be fixed up. We at LCS
have stopped using W, and are now actively building applications on X.
Anyone else using W should seriously consider switching. This is not the
ultimate window system, but I believe it is a good starting point for
experimentation. Right at the moment there is a CLU (and an Argus)
interface to X; a C interface is in the works. The three existing
applications are a text editor (TED), an Argus I/O interface, and a
primitive window manager. There is no documentation yet; anyone crazy
enough to volunteer? I may get around to it eventually. ↫ Robert W.
Scheifler Reading this announcement email made me wonder if way back
then, in 1984, the year of my birth, there were also people poo-pooing
this new thing called “X” for not having all the features W had. There
must’ve people posting angry messages on various BBS servers about how X
is dumb and useless since it doesn’t have their feature in W that allows
them to use an acoustic modem to send a signal over their internal
telephone system by slapping their terminal in just the right spot to
activate their Betamax that’s hotwired into the telephone system. I
mean, W was only about a year old at the time, so probably not, but
there must’ve been a lot of complaining and whining about this
newfangled X thing, and now, 40 years later, long after it has outgrown
its usefulness, we’re again dealing with people so hell-bent on keeping
an outdated system running but hoping – nay, demanding – others to do
the actual work of maintaining it. X served its purpose. It took way too
long, but we’ve moved on. Virtually every new Linux user since roughly
12-24 months ago will most likely never use X, and never even know what
it was. They’re using a more modern, more stable, more performant, more
secure, and better maintained system, leading to a better user
experience, and that’s something we should all agree on is a good
thing.</p>

Perhaps the intention is that HotKeys set the appropriate key

Storm Alberto forms over Gulf of Mexico, bringing floods</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MEXICO CITY — Tropical Storm Alberto, the first named storm of 2024
Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the western Gulf of Mexico,
the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC), said on Wednesday, bringing 
flooding across the southern coast of the United States. </p>
<p>The storm was located about 300 kilometers (186.4 miles) east of
Tampico, Mexico, packing maximum sustained winds of 65 kilometers per
hour (40.3 miles per hour), the forecaster said. Alberto is likely to
dissipate over Mexico as early as Thursday night. </p>
<p>The NHC said the storm was very large and that rainfall, coastal
flooding and strong winds could occur far from the center along
north-eastern Mexico and the south Texas coast.  </p>
<p>Heavy rains also will affect large regions of Central America, the
NHC warned, a region that is still facing strong rains that left some 11
people dead in El Salvador over the weekend because of landslides and
road accidents. </p>
<p>“Life-threatening flooding and mudslides are likely in and near
higher terrain across the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and
Tamaulipas,” the NHC said, including the eastern city of Ciudad Victoria
and Monterrey, Mexico’s third-biggest city in Nuevo Leon state. </p>
<p>Nuevo Leon State Governor Samuel Garcia said on the social media
platform X that people should avoid leaving the house or crossing
waterways while it is raining and to keep emergency kits on hand.
Workers were ready to address the possible impact of strong winds and
rain on the electrical grid, water supplies, and sewage, he said. </p>
<p>Across the Gulf on Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula, local media reported
strong winds and torrential rains. Some authorities, however, said the
storm could help fill the country’s dams, depleted by an extended
drought. </p>
<p>The NHC predicted “moderate coastal flooding” along much of the Texan
coast through Thursday as southern areas experience tropical storm
conditions.  </p>
<p>Forecasters have warned that this year’s Atlantic hurricane season
will likely be highly active because of impacts from the La Nina weather
pattern and warmer ocean water.</p>

Great book, I hated every second of it. The topic is very interesting but most of the concepts and examples were infuriating. The book touches on pretty much everything I hate about the current state of the world when it comes to its relationship with money and advertising. Still, was good company on a few long road trips and I love when the audiobooks are narrated by the author.

XREAL is a company that makes Augmented Reality glasses, which basically
put a floating display in front of your eyes without completely
obscuring your vision, allowing you to see virtual and real-world
objects at the same time. The latest model also support “immersion
controls” which let you block out the real world while watching videos.

<blockquote>
<p>
“When law enforcement uses ALPRs to document the comings and goings of
every driver on the road, regardless of a nexus to a crime, it results
in gargantuan databases of sensitive information, and few agencies are
equipped, staffed, or trained to harden their systems against quickly
evolving cybersecurity threats.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As the EFF points out, it’s often vulnerable software - and even when
it’s not, it violates the security principle of only collecting the
information you need. Information security and data strategies are not
core law enforcement skillsets, and the software they buy is often
oversold.
</p>
<p>
As the EFF explains:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“That partially explains why, more than 125 law enforcement agencies
reported a data breach or cyberattacks between 2012 and 2020, according
to research by former EFF intern Madison Vialpando. The Motorola
Solutions article claims that ransomware attacks”targeting U.S. public
safety organizations increased by 142 percent” in 2023.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The use of these tactics seems uncontrolled - perhaps this is one area
where legislation could help.

<h2 id="us-lawmakers-meet-dalai-lama-as-china-slams-visit">US lawmakers
meet Dalai Lama as China slams visit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New Delhi — A group of U.S. lawmakers met the Dalai Lama in India’s
northern town of Dharamshala Wednesday, amid cheers from Tibetans in
exile and an angry reaction from China, which calls the Tibetan
spiritual leader a separatist and a splittist.</p>
<p>The visit follows the passage last week of a bill by the U.S.
Congress that seeks to encourage dialogue between Beijing and Tibetan
leaders in exile, who have been seeking more autonomy for Tibet. Talks
with the Dalai Lama’s representatives and China stalled in 2010.</p>
<p>“This bill is a message to the Chinese government that we have
clarity in our thinking and our understanding of this issue of the
freedom of Tibet,” Nancy Pelosi, former House Speaker, said to cheers
from hundreds of Tibetans whom the lawmakers addressed at a public
ceremony after meeting the Dalai Lama at his residence.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to soon sign the legislation
called “Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act,” also
referred to as the Resolve Tibet Act.</p>
<p>In Dharamshala, where the Tibetan government in exile is based, the
visit of the U.S. lawmakers brought hope. “It is a jubilant moment for
all Tibetans. We are all overjoyed. The visit is very significant
because it comes soon after the passage of the bill which we hope will
soon be passed into law,” Tenzin Lekshay, spokesperson for the Central
Tibetan Administration, told VOA.</p>
<p>Congressman Michael McCaul, who led the seven-member visiting
delegation, said the bill reaffirms American support for what he
referred to as the Tibetan right to self- determination. He said that
their delegation had received a letter from the Chinese Communist Party,
warning them not to visit.</p>
<p>Beijing said the U.S. should not sign into law the bill passed by
Congress. “China will take resolute measures to firmly defend its
sovereignty, security and development interests,” Chinese foreign
ministry spokesman, Lin Jian said on Tuesday, as the lawmakers arrived
in the Indian town.</p>
<p>The Chinese embassy in New Delhi reiterated Beijing’s concerns. “We
urge the U.S. side to fully recognize the anti-China separatist nature
of the Dalai group, honor the commitments the U.S. has made to China on
issues related to Xizang, stop sending the wrong signal to the world,”
it said in a statement Tuesday night. Xizang is China’s name for
Tibet.</p>
<p>In his remarks to Tibetans, McCaul said it is important that China
not influence the choice of the Dalai Lama’s successor. “Beijing has
even attempted to insert itself into choosing the successor of the Dalai
Lama,” he said. “We will not let that happen.”</p>
<p>The issue is contentious. China says it has the right to approve the
spiritual leader’s successor while according to Tibetan tradition, the
Dalai Lama is reincarnated after his death. The Dalai Lama has said his
successor is likely to be found in India but Tibetans in exile fear
China will try to designate a person to be the successor, in an effort
to bolster control over Tibet.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tibetan spokesman Lekshay said China needs to come forward
to reinstate a dialogue with exiled Tibetan leaders. “It is a time for
introspection for China to see what is going wrong, particularly with
the Tibet issue which has been a longstanding conflict. China needs to
be more positive.”</p>
<p>Beijing does not recognize the exiled administration. A formal
dialogue process between the Dalai Lama’s representatives and the
Chinese government ended in 2010 after it failed to produce a concrete
outcome.</p>
<p>Pointing out that they are asking for autonomy within China and not
independence, Lekshay said the Tibetan administration in exile did not
represent a separatist movement.</p>
<p>Tibetans in exile say they fear that their culture, language and
identity is under threat due to Chinese assimilation of the region.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959, has been instrumental in
putting the Tibetan cause in the global spotlight but in recent years
some Tibetan activists have expressed concerns that the Tibet cause is
not getting appropriate attention in Western capitals.</p>
<p>The Himalayan town of Dharamshala has been the Dalai Lama’s home
since he fled Tibet over six decades ago following a failed uprising
against Chinese rule.</p>

<p class="drop-caps" style="text-align: left;">
Maybe you’re reading this in a downpour. Perhaps you’re reading it
because you have questions about the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/noaa-hurricane-forecast-2024" target="_self">upcoming
hurricane season</a>. Or maybe you’re reading it because you’re one of
the 150 million Americans enduring
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/live-blog/heat-wave-live-updates-rcna157615" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">record-breaking
temperatures</a> in this week’s heat dome.
</p>
<p>
Whatever the reason, you have a question: <em><em> Is this climate
change</em></em>?
</p>
<p>
There’s an old maxim — that, like many things, is often dubiously
attributed to Mark Twain — that goes something like, “Climate is what
you expect and weather is what you get.” Weather refers to the event
itself, while climate refers to the trends (averaged over 30 years or
more,
<a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/weather-or-climate-whats-difference/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">usually</a>)
that might make such an event more or less likely.
</p>
<p>
Climate change is almost always an exacerbating factor in the case of
something like a heat wave or a heat dome. In other situations, the
picture is far more complicated and uncertain. It can take years to
understand if and how climate change made an extreme weather event more
likely, and while organizations like
<a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World
Weather Attribution</a> work hard to provide quick and accurate
estimations, getting the science wrong can fuel climate skepticism and
bolster deniers’ arguments. While it might be tempting to pin all
extreme weather on climate change, the truth is, not all of it is.
</p>
<p>
Still, we do know a lot about how climate change influences the weather
— and we’re always learning more. While this guide is far from the
be-all and end-all of attribution and should be referred to with
caveats, here is what we know about how climate change is shaping the
extreme weather we see today.

<h3 class="rm-anchors" id="heat">
Heat waves and heat domes
</h3>
<p>
“When you’re looking at heat extremes, there is almost always a climate
change signal,” Clair Barnes, a research associate with World Weather
Attribution, told me. “I don’t think there’s ever <em><em>not</em></em>
been a climate change signal since I’ve been doing it in the last couple
of years.”
</p>
<p>
As the planet warms, local temperatures respond everywhere. There are
not as many complicating variables in this relationship as there are
with something like <a href="#drought">drought</a>. “With heat waves,
it’s the same answer every time: It got hotter because it’s got hotter,”
Barnes said.
</p>
<p>
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2752-5295/ac6e7d" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
found</u></a> that the kind of heat waves that would have occurred once
in a decade before the Industrial Revolution now occur almost three
times more frequently and are 1.2 degrees Celsius (or 2.2 degrees
Fahrenheit) warmer. The most extreme examples — like the 2021 heat dome
over the Pacific Northwest — appear to have been possible
<em><em>only</em></em> because of warming caused by
<a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>greenhouse
gas emissions</u></a>. Additionally, about 37% of global
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/heat-wave-stroke-death-die" target="_self"><u>heat-related
deaths</u></a>, which amount to tens of thousands of deaths per year,
are attributable to climate change.
</p>
<p>
There have, of course, always been heat waves. But it is with high
confidence that scientists say
<a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/more-extremely-hot-days-2023" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>they
are hotter and last longer</u></a> now than they would otherwise because
of climate change.
</p>
<p>
<em><strong><em>Did climate change do it?</em></strong></em><em><em> It
is
“</em></em><a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-what-the-new-ipcc-report-says-about-extreme-weather-and-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>virtually
certain</em></em></u></a><em><em>” that heat waves are more frequent and
hotter than they otherwise would be because of climate change.</em></em>
</p>
<h3 class="rm-anchors" id="fire">
Wildfires
</h3>
<p>
WWA doesn’t specifically study wildfires since they aren’t technically
“weather” (though once they form,
<a href="https://www.capradio.org/articles/2022/08/05/massive-wildfires-are-creating-their-own-weather-scientists-want-to-learn-how-to-predict-it/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>they
can make their own</u></a>). Instead, the organization studies the
conditions that make a fire <em><em>more likely</em></em>. In the
American West, this deadly combo usually involves high pressure,
extremely dry air, and some wind.
</p>
<p>
Globally, burned areas decreased between 1998 and 2015, but that isn’t
because fire-weather conditions are improving — rather, regional leaders
have gotten better at things like land use and fire management. Fire
<em><em>weather</em></em>, meanwhile, is increasing and lasting longer
due to climate change. In particular, hotter temperatures — especially
<a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/warm-summer-nights-2022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hotter
overnight temperatures</u></a> — make it more difficult to combat the
fires that do ignite. (Most fires in the U.S. start due to human
<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1617394114" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>negligence</u></a>
or
<a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/research/treesearch/37036" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>arson</u></a>,
rather than by natural causes such as lightning strikes.)
</p>
<p>
This is especially the case in California, where 10 of the state’s
largest fires have occurred in the past two decades, with five in 2020
alone; a 2023 National Integrated Drought Information System-funded
study further found
<a href="https://www.drought.gov/news/study-finds-climate-change-blame-record-breaking-california-wildfires-2023-08-08" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
320% increase in burned areas</a> in the state between 1996 and 2021 due
to contributions of human-caused climate change, with that number
expected to grow in the coming decades.
</p>
<p>
On average, wildfire weather season lengthened
<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020RG000726" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>by
two weeks</u></a> around the globe from 1979 to 2019. The IPCC has
<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-11/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>medium
confidence</u></a> in the claim that fire weather has become more
probable in the U.S., Europe, Australia, and parts of Europe over the
past century, and high confidence that fire weather will increase
regionally due to global warming in the coming years.
</p>
<p>
<em><strong><em>Did climate change do it?
</em></strong></em><em><em>Climate change has almost certainly
exacerbated the heat, humidity, and drought conditions necessary for
wildfires to start. The actual ignition of the fire is frequently
human-caused, however, and complicating variables such as
</em></em><a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/grass-fires-wildfires-maui-marshall" target="_self"><em>local
vegetation</em></a><em><em>, forest management, and land use can also
muddle the picture.</em></em>
</p>
<h3 class="rm-anchors" id="hurricanes">
Hurricanes and tropical storms
</h3>
<p>
Tropical cyclones are large and complicated storm systems.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/why-is-the-atlantic-ocean-so-hot" target="_self"><u>Ocean
temperatures</u></a>, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, wind shear,
barometric pressure, atmospheric moisture,
<a href="https://mynews13.com/fl/orlando/weather/2023/09/07/bathymetry--a-lesser-known-factor-for-storm-surge" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
shape of the continental shelf</u></a>, emergency preparedness measures,
and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-season-2024" target="_self"><u>pure
luck</u></a> all affect how destructive a given storm might be — when or
if it makes landfall. Climate change can put a thumb on the scale, but
it is far from a lone actor.
</p>
<p>
Hurricanes — the strongest
<a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/cyclone.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>manifestation</u></a>
of a tropical cyclone — essentially work by transferring
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/09/climate-change-impact-hurricane-ian/671604/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>heat
from the ocean into wind energy</u></a>. Because the ocean absorbs
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/15/oceans-have-been-absorbing-the-worlds-extra-heat-but-theres-a-huge-payback" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>excess
heat from the warming atmosphere</u></a>, scientists expect to see more
“major” hurricanes of Category 3 or above in the coming years.
</p>
<p>
The storms aren’t just getting more powerful, though. Because of the
interaction between ocean heat and energy in a hurricane, the storms
also intensify more rapidly and are “more than twice as likely to
strengthen from a weak Category 1 hurricane to a major Category 3 or
stronger hurricane in a 24-hour period than they were between 1970 and
1990,” according to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/hurricanes-rapid-intensification-andra-garner" target="_self"><u>new
research published last year</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
WWA says it cannot attribute the intensification of any
<em><em>individual</em></em> storm to climate change
<a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/wp-content/uploads/ENG_WWA-Reporting-extreme-weather-and-climate-change.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>due
to relatively limited modeling</u></a> so far, so the organization
instead looks at how climate change may have amplified associated
rainfall and storm surges. <a href="#rain">Rainfall and flooding</a>
are, in fact,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/noaa-hurricane-forecast-2024" target="_self"><u>more
deadly</u></a> than high wind speeds in hurricanes, and both are
understood to be increasing because of climate change. Put simply, a
warmer atmosphere can hold more water, which means worse deluges.
Researchers linked extreme rainfall during Hurricanes Katrina, Maria,
and Irma to climate change; Hurricane Harvey, which flooded up to 50% of
the properties in Harris County, Texas, when it made landfall in 2017,
had a rainfall total 15% to 38% greater than it would have been in a
pre-industrial world,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/25/climate/hurricane-harvey-climate-change.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>researchers
found</u></a>. Additionally, rising sea levels caused by climate change
will worsen coastal flooding during such events.
</p>
<p>
However, “trends indicate no significant change in the frequency of
tropical cyclones globally,” according to the IPCC. That is, there
aren’t <em><em>more </em></em>hurricanes; the ones that form are just
more likely to become <em><em>major</em></em> hurricanes. Scientists
understand far less about what climate change means for the smaller
Category 1 or 2 storms, or if it will impact the diameter of the storms
that do form.
</p>
<p>
<em><strong><em>Did climate change do it? </em></strong></em><em><em>The
greenhouse effect is making the atmosphere warmer, and in a warmer
climate, we’d expect to see more major hurricanes of Category 3 and
above. Evidence also points to hurricanes intensifying much more rapidly
in today’s climate than in the past. Climate does not seem to play a
role in the overall number of storms, though, and other critical factors
like the path of a storm and the emergency preparedness of a given
community have a significant impact on the potential loss of life but
aren’t linked to a warmer atmosphere. Hurricanes are complicated events
and there is still much more research to be done in understanding how
exactly they’re impacted by climate change.</em></em>
</p>
<h3 class="rm-anchors" id="rain">
Extreme rain, floods, and landslides
</h3>
<p>
In the winter, your skin might feel dry, and your lips might chap; in
the summer, many parts of the country feel sticky and swampy. This is
simple, observable physics: Cold air holds less moisture, and warm air
holds more. The “Clausius-Clapeyron” relation, as it is known, tells us
that in 1 degree C warmer air, there is 7% more moisture. All that
moisture has to go somewhere, so quite literally, when it rains, it
pours. (That is, when and <em><em>where</em></em> it rains: WWA notes
that “an attribution study in northern Europe found that human influence
has so far had little effect on the atmospheric circulation that caused
a severe rainfall event.”)
</p>
<p>
Like heat, the relationship between warm air and rainfall is well
understood, which is why the IPCC is highly confident in the
attributable influence of climate change on extreme rain. While it
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change" target="_self"><u>may
seem confusing</u></a> that both droughts and intense rainfall are
symptoms of climate change, the warming atmosphere seems to
<a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/drought-and-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>increase
precipitation variability</u></a>, making events on the extreme margins
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/03/14/climate/extreme-weather-climate-change.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
likely and more frequent</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Increased precipitation can have counterintuitive results, though. Rain
occurring over fewer overall days due to bursts of extreme rainfall, for
example, can actually
<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2752-5295/ac6e7d" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>worsen
droughts</u></a>. And while it might seem like more water in the
atmosphere would mean snowier winters, that’s only true in certain
places. Because it’s <em><em>also </em></em>warmer,
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/25/weather/snowfall-temperatures-climate-change-water/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>snowfall
is declining globally</u></a> while winters are getting wetter — and as
a result,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/warm-winters-mental-health-depression" target="_self"><u>probably
more miserable</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
But what does “more rain” really mean? Rain on its own isn’t necessarily
bad, but when it
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/nyc-flooding-whirlpool-subway-sea-lions" target="_self"><u>overwhelms
urban infrastructure</u></a> or
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/flash-flood-warning-watch" target="_self"><u>threatens
roads and houses</u></a>, it can quickly become deadly. Flooding, of
course, is often the result of extreme rain, but “the signal in the
rainfall is not necessarily correlated to the magnitude of the floods
because there are other factors that turn rain into a flood,” Barnes,
the research associate with WWA, told me, citing variables such as land
use, water management, urban drainage, and other physical elements of a
landscape.
</p>
<p>
Landslides, likewise, are caused by everything from volcanic eruptions
to human construction, but rain is often a factor (climate-linked
phenomena like
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/climate/wildfire-extreme-rain-mudslides.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wildfires</a>
and
<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/chapter/chapter-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>thawing
permafrost</u></a> also contribute to landslides). The IPCC writes with
“high confidence” that landslides, along with floods and water
availability, “have the potential to lead to severe consequences for
people, infrastructure, and the economy in most mountain regions.”
</p>
<p>
<em><strong><em>Did climate change do it?
</em></strong></em><em><em>More extreme rainfall is consistent with our
understanding of climate change’s effects. Many other local, physical
factors</em></em><em><strong>
</strong></em><em><em>can</em></em><em><strong>
</strong></em><em><em>compound or mitigate disasters like floods and
mudslides, however.</em></em>
</p>
<h2>
<u><em><em></em></em>The Oddballs</u>
</h2>
<h3 class="rm-anchors" id="drought">
Drought
</h3>
<p>
When I spoke with Barnes, of WWA, she told me, “It’s really easy to
define a heat wave. You just go, ‘It was hot.’” Droughts, not so much.
For one thing, you have to define the time span you’re looking at. There
are also different kinds of drought: meteorological, when there hasn’t
been enough rain; hydrological, when rivers are low possibly because
something else is diverting water from the natural cycle; and
agricultural, when there is not enough water specifically for crops.
Like flooding, many different infrastructural and physical factors go
into exacerbating or even creating various kinds of droughts.
</p>
<p>
Drought as we mean it here, though, is a question of soil moisture,
Barnes told me. “That’s really hard to get data on,” she said, “and we
don’t necessarily understand the feedback mechanisms affecting that as
well as we understand heat waves.” As recently as 2013, the IPCC
<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-climate-change-is-already-making-droughts-worse/" target="_blank"><u>had
only low confidence</u></a> that trends in drought could be attributed
to climate change.
</p>
<p>
We have a better understanding of how drought and climate change
interact now, including how higher temperatures drive evaporation and
cut into snowpack, leading to less meltwater in rivers. The IPCC’s most
recent report concluded that “even relatively small incremental
increases in global warming (+0.5C) cause a worsening of droughts in
some regions.” The IPCC also has high confidence that “more regions are
affected by increases in agricultural and ecological droughts with
increasing global warming.”
</p>
<p>
WWA’s attribution studies have, however, found examples of droughts that
have <em><em>no</em></em> connection to climate change. The organization
flags that it has the highest confidence in the climate affecting
droughts in the Mediterranean, southern Africa, central and eastern
Asia, southern Australia, and western North America and lower confidence
in central and west Africa, western and central Europe, northeast South
America, and New Zealand.
</p>
<p>
<em><strong><em>Did climate change do it?
</em></strong></em><em><em>Maybe. Some droughts have a strong climate
signal — California’s, for example. Still, researchers remain cautious
about attribution for these complicated events due in part to their
</em></em><a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2023/05/climate-change-and-droughts-whats-the-connection/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>significant
regional variability</em></em></u></a><em><em>. </em></em>
</p>
<h3 class="rm-anchors" id="tornadoes">
Tornadoes
</h3>
<p>
Tornadoes are extremely difficult to study. Compared to droughts, which
can last years, tornadoes occupy a teeny tiny area and last for just a
blip in time. They “wouldn’t even register” on the models WWA uses for
its attribution studies, Barnes said. “It would probably look like a
slightly raised average wind speed.” The IPCC,
<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Chapter11.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>for
its part</u></a>, has only “low confidence” in a connection between
climate change and “severe convective storms” like tornadoes, in part
due to the “short length of high-quality data records.”
</p>
<p>
But we are learning more every day. This spring, researchers posited
that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/tornado-study" target="_self"><u>Tornado
Alley is moving east</u></a> and “away from the warm season, especially
the summer, and toward the cold season.” Though it’s not entirely clear
why this is happening, one theory is that it relates to how climate
change is affecting regional seasonality: winters and nights are
becoming warmer in certain areas, and thus more conducive to tornado
formation, while others are becoming
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/04/02/tornadoes-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>too
hot</u></a> for storms to form during the normal season.
</p>
<p>
<em><strong><em>Did climate change do it?
</em></strong></em><em><em>Researchers aren’t entirely sure but there
doesn’t appear to be a correlation between tornado formation and climate
change. Still, warmer temperatures potentially make certain areas more
or less prone to tornadoes than they were in the past. </em></em>

We say “<em><em>it was a dark and stormy night</em></em>” because
“<em><em>it was a severe convective storm</em></em>” doesn’t have the
same ring. But an SCS — which forms when warm, moist air rises into
colder air — is
<a href="https://www.zurichna.com/knowledge/articles/2023/08/rise-in-severe-convective-storms-increases-risk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
most common and most damaging</u></a> weather phenomenon in the United
States. You probably just call it a thunderstorm.
</p>
<p>
Severe convective storms cause many localized events that we think of as
“weather,” including <a href="#rain">heavy rainfall</a>, high winds,
<a href="#tornadoes">tornadoes</a>, hail, thunder, and lightning.
Because heat and moisture are necessary ingredients for these kinds of
storms, and because the atmosphere is getting both warmer and wetter,
climate models “consistently” and confidently predict an “increase in
the frequency of severe thunderstorms,” the IPCC notes — but, “there is
low confidence<em> </em>in the details of the projected increase.”
Trends remain poorly studied and highly regionally dependent; in the
United States, for example, there is still no evidence of a “significant
increase in convective storms, and hail and severe thunderstorms.”
Still,
<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021EF002277" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>other
research</u></a> suggests that for every 1.8 degree F of warming, the
conditions favorable to severe convective storms will increase in
frequency by up to 20%.
</p>
<p>
Hail forms during severe convective storms when the hot, moist air rises
to a region of the atmosphere
<a href="https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/hail/#:~:text=Hailstones%20are%20formed%20when%20raindrops,freeze%20onto%20the%20hailstone's%20surface." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>where
it is cold enough to freeze</u></a>. Like thunderstorms more generally,
data is fairly limited on hail, making it difficult to study long-term
trends (most climate models also
<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-12/#12.3.4.5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>do
not look directly at hail</u></a>, studying convective storms more
broadly instead). However,
<a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/severe-storm-super-hazards" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>it’s
been hypothesized</u></a> that climate change could create larger and
more destructive hail in the future; if thunderstorm updrafts grow
stronger, as projected, then they could hold hail at freezing high
altitudes for longer, allowing individual hailstones to grow larger
before falling back to Earth.
<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022EF002768" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>One
study</u></a> even suggested that with continued warming, there could be
a 145% increase in “significant severe hail” measuring at least 2 inches
in diameter — that is, a little smaller than a tennis ball.
</p>
<p>
<em><em><em><strong><em>Did climate change do it?
</em></strong></em><em><em>Everything we know about thunderstorms
suggests that a warmer, wetter atmosphere will mean severe convection
storms become both more frequent and more intense. But there is still
very little available data to track the long-term trends attributing any
one storm to climate change would be nearly
impossible.</em></em><br/></em></em>
</p>
<h3 class="rm-anchors" id="snow">
Snowstorms and extreme cold
</h3>
<p>
Just as virtually all <a href="#heat">heat waves</a> worldwide are
worsened by climate change, “nearly every instance of extreme cold
across the world has decreased in likelihood,” according to the WWA.
While the organization has run attribution studies on “a few” heavy
snowfall events, it has either found no link to climate change or has
been unable to state a conclusion confidently. On the other hand, the
<a href="https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6syr/pdf/IPCC_AR6_SYR_LongerReport.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>
</u><u><em><em>loss </em></em></u><u>of snow cover</u></a>, permafrost,
Arctic sea ice, and glaciers has a high-confidence link to human-caused
climate change in the IPCC report.
</p>
<p>
Just because climate change makes extreme cold and snowstorms less
likely does not mean they won’t happen.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/ski-snowboard-season-snow-climate-change" target="_self"><u>Research
published in </u><u><em><em>Nature</em></em></u></a> earlier this year
suggests climate change could bring more snow to certain places, as
extremely cold parts of the world warm to
<a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/weather/2021/01/25/buffalo-blog-post" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>snow-friendly
temperatures</u></a>, and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/east-west-flood-blizzard-storm" target="_self"><u>increased
precipitation</u></a> from a warmer atmosphere results in more flurries.
Parts of Siberia and the northern Great Plains are even experiencing a
<em><em>deepening</em></em> snowpack.
</p>
<p>
<em><strong><em>Did climate change do it?
</em></strong></em><em><em>Probably not — though there are notable
exceptions.</em></em>
</p>
<h3 class="rm-anchors" id="earthquakes">
Earthquakes
</h3>
<p>
An earthquake is usually caused by the release of energy when two
tectonic plates suddenly slip past each other (though they can also be
caused
<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/02/08/west-texas-earthquakes-fracking/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>by
fossil fuel extraction</u></a>). But before you dismiss earthquakes as
having no connection to climate change, there <em><em>is </em></em>one
place where there <em><em>could</em></em> be a link: water.
</p>
<p>
As Emily Pontecorvo
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/climate-change-earthquakes" target="_self"><u>wrote
for Heatmap</u></a> this spring, “Changes in surface water, whether
because of heavy rain, snow, or drought, could either increase or
relieve stress on geologic faults, causing them to shift.” Admittedly,
even if there <em><em>is</em></em> a relationship between climate
change, water, and earthquakes, it appears to be small — so small that
humans probably can’t feel any resulting quakes.
</p>
<p>
<em><strong><em>Did climate change do it?
</em></strong></em><em><em>It’s highly unlikely.</em></em>
</p>
<h3 class="rm-anchors" id="turbulence">
Airplane turbulence
</h3>
<p>
Earlier this year,
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-21/singapore-air-flight-makes-emergency-landing-in-bangkok-1-dead" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>extreme
turbulence</u></a> on a Singapore-bound flight from London killed one
person and injured at least 20 others. While such events remain rare —
the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board
<a href="https://stevens.house.gov/media/in-the-news/singapore-airlines-flight-puts-focus-rising-turbulence-danger#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20National%20Transportation%20Safety,and%20were%20in%20stable%20condition." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recorded</u></a>
just 101 serious injuries caused by turbulence on millions of flights
between 2013 and 2022 — extreme turbulence appears to be increasing,
potentially because of climate change.
</p>
<p>
According to
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/21/what-causes-air-turbulence-and-how-worried-should-passengers-be" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one
study</u></a>, severe turbulence is up 55% between 1979 and 2020,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2019/08/07/buckle-up-climate-change-is-already-contributing-bumpier-north-atlantic-flights-study-finds/?itid=lk_inline_manual_12" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>seemingly
due to</u></a> an increase in wind shear at high altitudes caused by the
temperature contrast between the equator and the North Pole. (This
relationship is a little bit complicated, but essentially, at higher
altitudes, the temperature over the pole has been
<em><em>declining</em></em> due to rapid Arctic temperature changes even
as it’s increased at the equator; lower in the troposphere, the opposite
is happening). Other studies have similarly shown that doubling the
concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could increase
moderate-to-severe turbulence by
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-21/flight-turbulence-is-getting-worse-because-of-climate-change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>as
much as 127%</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Data, however, is limited and fairly subjective, leading to some
skepticism in the scientific community and
<a href="https://x.com/DrPaulDWilliams/status/1794332398215430377" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>inaccurate
dismissals by climate-change deniers</u></a>. As with many complex
weather phenomena, our understanding of how climate change interacts
with turbulence will likely grow in the coming years as the field of
research develops.
</p>
<p>
<em><strong><em>Did climate change do it?
</em></strong></em><em><em>Potentially in some cases, but there is still
much to learn about the connection between the two.</em></em>
</p>
<h3 class="rm-anchors" id="dust">
Dust and sand storms
</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-desertification-and-the-role-of-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Desertification</u></a>
differs from drought in that it describes a decline in soil fertility,
water, and plant life to the point of total “land degradation.” (In
contrast, land can become productive again after a drought.) Like other
compound disasters, desertification results from natural processes,
climatic conditions, and land management practices such as grazing and
deforestation.
</p>
<p>
According to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, land degradation is “almost always”
the result of these “multiple interacting causes,” and the warming
climate certainly isn’t helping. Heat stress can kill off vegetation,
making landscapes more prone to desertification, as well as drive
aridification.
</p>
<p>
In the resulting drylands — which comprise about 46% of global land area
— you can expect dust storms (also known as
<a href="https://ein.az.gov/hazards/dust-storms#:~:text=Thunderstorms%20frequently%20produce%20strong%20winds,desert%20landscape%20at%20any%20time." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>haboobs</u></a>),
and sand storms resulting from the wind kicking up loose soils. While
there have always been sand storms, one
<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014JD022062" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a>
suggests that climate change is one of the critical drivers of global
annual dust emissions increasing by 25% between the late 19th century
and today.
</p>
<p>
However, “climate change impacts on dust and sand storm activity remain
a critical gap,”
<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/4/2022/11/SRCCL_Chapter_3.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>writes
the IPCC</u></a>, and more research is desperately needed to address
this. By the UN’s estimate, dust storms were
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8249988/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>associated</u></a>
with the deaths of 402,000 people in 2005. As many as 951 million
people, mainly in South Asia, Central Asia, West Africa, and East Asia,
could be vulnerable to the impacts of desertification if climate change
continues.
</p>
<p>
<em><strong><em>Did climate change do it? </em></strong></em><em><em>It
was potentially a factor, but we have lots more to learn.</em></em>
</p>
<h3 class="rm-anchors" id="locust">
Locust swarms
</h3>
<p>
Are locust swarms technically “weather”? Not really. But so long as
we’re on the topic of weather events of Biblical proportions, locust
swarms might as well be addressed, too.
</p>
<p>
And the answer may surprise you: Climate appears to be a driver of
locust swarms, which threaten food security and exacerbate famines
throughout Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. Locusts prefer “arid
areas punched by <a href="#rain">extreme rainfall</a>,” according to
<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adj1164" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one
study</u></a> that looked at the connection between swarms and climate
change, and while much of that pattern is fixed in the natural El
Niño–Southern Oscillation cycle, a warming climate will also “lead to
widespread increases in locust outbreaks with emerging hotspots in west
central Asia.” In particular, the research found that in a low-emissions
scenario, locust habitat could increase by 5%, while in a high-emissions
scenario, it could increase by 13% to 25% between 2065 and 2100.
</p>
<p>
<em><strong><em>Did climate change do it?
</em></strong></em><em><em>It’d likely be tricky to attribute any one
locust swarm to climate change, but as with many other natural
phenomena, climate likely plays a compounding factor.</em></em>

temps and rain could help corral blazes that forced thousands to flee
New Mexico village</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ROSWELL, N.M. — Cooler weather — and the chance of rain — could bring
some relief this week to firefighters battling blazes in southern New
Mexico that killed one person, damaged hundreds of structures and forced
thousands to evacuate.</p>
<p>Strong wind pushed the larger of two wildfires into the mountain
village of Ruidoso, forcing residents to flee immediately with little
notice. Weather patterns are expected to shift by Wednesday morning with
moisture from a tropical wave in the Gulf of Mexico, said Joshua
Schroeder of the National Weather Service in Albuquerque.</p>
<p>“Today was really our last dry day,” he said late Tuesday. “Rains
will then peak into Thursday and diminish by the weekend.”</p>
<p>On the downside, he said, some shifts in wind were possible later
Wednesday, and rain could lead to flash flooding in newly burned
areas. </p>
<p>Ruidoso and much of the Southwest has been exceedingly dry and hot
this spring. Those conditions, along with strong wind, whipped flames
out of control Monday and Tuesday, rapidly advancing the South Fork Fire
into the village. Along with homes and businesses, a regional medical
center and the Ruidoso Downs horse track were evacuated.</p>
<p>Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office confirmed one fatality as a
result of the fire but said it had no further details.</p>
<p>More than 500 structures have been destroyed or damaged, but it’s
unclear how many were homes. A flyover to provide more accurate mapping
and a better assessment of damage was planned overnight Tuesday, Lujan
Grisham said.</p>
<p>Ardis Holder left Ruidoso with her two young daughters, her gas tank
nearly on empty and praying that they’d make it out safe. She was sure
the house she rented in the village she grew up in is gone, based on the
maps she’s seen so far.</p>
<p>“We were already seeing where all the fire hit, it’s everywhere,” she
said late Tuesday from a shelter in nearby Roswell. “If there’s
something standing, that’s awesome. But, if not, we were prepared for
the worst.”</p>
<p>Lujan Grisham declared a county-wide state of emergency that extended
to the neighboring Mescalero Apache Reservation where both fires started
and deployed National Guard troops. The declaration unlocks additional
funding and resources to manage the crisis.</p>
<p>Nationwide, wildfires have scorched more than 3,280 square miles
(8,495 square kilometers) this year — a figure higher than the 10-year
averages, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. About 20
wildfires currently burning are considered large and uncontained,
including blazes in California and Washington state.</p>
<p>Lujan Grisham said the two southern New Mexico wildfires together
have consumed more than 31 square miles (80 square kilometers). The
exact causes of the blazes hasn’t been determined, but the Southwest
Coordination Center listed them as human-caused.</p>
<p>“We are deploying every available resource to control these fires.”
she said.</p>
<p>While many older residents call Ruidoso home year-round, the
population of around 7,000 people expands to about 25,000 during the
warmer months, when New Mexicans and Texans from hotter climates seek
the cool of the leafy aspen trees, hiking trails and a chance to go
fishing. </p>
<p>Nestled within the Lincoln National Forest, Ruidoso boasts nearby
amenities including a casino, golf course and ski resort operated by the
Mescalero Apache Tribe. Horse races at the Ruidoso Downs also draw
crowds as home to one of the sport’s richest quarter-horse
competitions.</p>
<p>Ruidoso residents fled Monday through traffic-clogged downtown
streets some described as apocalyptic, with smoke darkening the evening
sky, embers raining down and 100-foot (30-meter) flames in the distance
climbing over a ridgeline.</p>
<p>The evacuation order came so quickly that she Christy Hood and her
husband Richard only had time to grab their two children and two dogs.
Heavy traffic on the way out turned what should have been a 15-minute
drive into a harrowing two-hour ordeal.</p>
<p>“As we were leaving, there were flames in front of me and to the side
of me,” said Hood, a real estate agent in Ruidoso. “And all the animals
were just running — charging — trying to get out.”</p>
<p>On social media posts, Ruidoso officials didn’t mince words: “GO NOW:
Do not attempt to gather belongings or protect your home. Evacuate
immediately.”</p>
<p>As Jacquie and Ernie Escajeda left church Monday in Ruidoso, they saw
smoke rise above a mountain behind their house.</p>
<p>They kept a close eye on their cellphones and turned on the radio for
updates. There was no “get ready,” nor “get set” — it was just “go,”
Ernie Escajeda said. They grabbed legal documents and other belongings
and left.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the couple got a call from friends who are on vacation in
Utah but have a home in Ruidoso that they’ve been told was destroyed,
Jacquie Escajeda said.</p>
<p>“They lost their home,” she said. “There’s only one home standing in
their whole little division that they live in, so there are a lot of
structures lost. We have no idea if we’re going to have a home to go
to.”</p>
<p>Public Service Company of New Mexico shut off power to part of the
village due to the fire.</p>
<p>Lujan Grisham said cellphone service had been affected in some
communities near the fire, and mobile cell towers were being set up to
restore communications.</p>
<p>Amid highway closures, many evacuees had little choice but to flee
eastward and to the city of Roswell, 75 miles (121 kilometers) away,
where hotels and shelters quickly filled. A rural gas station along the
evacuation route was overrun with people and cars.</p>

So Big</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
China’s electric vehicle industry has driven itself to the center of the
global conversation. Its automakers produce dozens of affordable,
technologically advanced electric vehicles that rival — and often beat —
anything coming out of Europe or North America. The United States and
the European Union have each levied tariffs on its car exports in the
past few months, hoping to avoid a “China shock” to their domestic car
industries.

<p>
<a href="https://www.csis.org/people/ilaria-mazzocco" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Ilaria
Mazzocco</u></a> has watched China’s EV industry grow from a small
regional experiment into a planet-reshaping juggernaut. She is now a
senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics
at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington,
D.C.
</p>
<p>
On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse talk with Ilaria
about how the industry got so big, what it means for the world, and how
to think about its environmental and national security impacts. Shift
Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of
Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems engineering at
Princeton University.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>I want to ask you a question that I’ve
actually gotten from a couple of friends and colleagues — you know,
normies, folks that don’t think about energy all the time. This is a
question they’ve asked me over the last couple of weeks: Do we actually
need 100% tariffs to compete? Is that where we’re at now?<br/> <br/> So
I’m curious, I mean, is this just politics? Is this just the Biden
administration kind of responding to Trump’s chest-beating and
anti-China rhetoric as we run up to the election here? Or is it, are we
really at the point where we dug ourselves such a hole that we need not
just a 25% tariff, which was the level before this — already quite
substantial — but a 100% tariff in order to compete? Or to protect the
opportunity for the U.S. automakers to get to those economies of scale
and have time to grow?<br/> <br/> <strong>Ilaria Mazzocco: </strong>I
think that’s a good question because — look, I testified in front of the
<a href="https://www.uscc.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>USCC</u></a>
last year. And you know, I brought the data, and I was like, look,
theoretically, these companies have a cost advantage. They could come to
the U.S. You know, a 25% tariff isn’t going to stop them.<br/> <br/> And
I made that argument, but — first of all, I didn’t think that was going
to be something that was going to be a problem in nine months, but you
know, that’s a different issue. But the argument, though, that was just
a cost thing, right? Then there’s a whole argument of, like, what does
the American consumer want? What does the Chinese producer want to do,
right? What is their strategy? American consumers are very different
from Chinese consumers, right? Chinese consumers are much more similar
to European consumers in terms of commuting time, preference for smaller
vehicles, right? Americans like pickup trucks, which — you know, I just
went to China in May. I saw a lot of EVs of all kinds. I did not see any
pickup trucks, right? That’s like a pretty American kind of thing. It’s
not clear that Chinese automakers would be able to compete on that,
right?<br/> <br/> So I think it’s quite possible that there would be a
very interested part of the American market in these Chinese EVs,
especially maybe the lower cost ones — maybe urban households that want
a cheaper second vehicle, or something of the sort.But is that going to
take over a huge portion of the American market? Is that really going to
be competition for GM, or for the F-150? Like, I don’t know, actually. I
think there’s an open question there, but clearly the Biden
administration didn’t want to take any chances on that.<br/> <br/> So I
think there’s also this element where we also have preconceptions of
what the American consumer wants, and clearly we’re not going to put
that to the test, right? We’re not going to have these lower cost EVs
come into the market and maybe reshape how people approach this. And as
I said before, I just don’t think it’s realistic. A world in which an
American government allows, the Detroit Three to fail is just not
particularly realistic. But I do worry — and I mean, I’ve said this
before, that it is a game, right? It is a balance that you need to get
when you’re playing with tariffs. Because when you protect an industry,
you give them time, but you also need to give them incentives. And the
IRA does that. But you need to give them some pressure, right?<br/>
<br/> And so I think, where’s the pressure going to come from? Is it
going to come from emissions standards? Or is it going to come from
competition? Clearly it’s not going to come from competition from China.
Is it going to come from competition with Korean automakers or Japanese
automakers? Question mark, right? We don’t know.

acknowledges Northwest dams have devastated the region’s Native
tribes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SEATTLE — The U.S. government on Tuesday acknowledged, for the first
time, the harmful role it has played over the past century in building
and operating dams in the Pacific Northwest — dams that devastated
Native American tribes by inundating their villages and decimating
salmon runs while bringing electricity, irrigation and jobs to nearby
communities.</p>
<p>In a new report, the Biden administration said those cultural,
spiritual and economic detriments continue to pain the tribes, which
consider salmon part of their cultural and spiritual identity, as well
as a crucial food source.</p>
<p>The government downplayed or accepted the well-known risk to the fish
in its drive for industrial development, converting the wealth of the
tribes into the wealth of non-Native people, according to the
report.</p>
<p>“The government afforded little, if any, consideration to the
devastation the dams would bring to Tribal communities, including to
their cultures, sacred sites, economies, and homes,” the report
said.</p>
<p>It added: “Despite decades of efforts and an enormous amount of
funding attempting to mitigate these impacts, salmon stocks remain
threatened or endangered and continued operation of the dams perpetuates
the myriad adverse effects.”</p>
<p>The Interior Department’s report comes amid a $1 billion effort
announced earlier this year to restore the region’s salmon runs before
more become extinct — and to better partner with the tribes on the
actions necessary to make that happen.</p>
<p>That includes increasing the production and storage of renewable
energy to replace hydropower generation that would be lost if four dams
on the lower Snake River are ever breached. Tribes, conservationists and
even federal scientists say that would be the best hope for recovering
the salmon, providing the fish with access to hundreds of miles of
pristine habitat and spawning grounds in Idaho.</p>
<p>“President Biden recognizes that to confront injustice, we must be
honest about history – even when doing so is difficult,” said a
statement from White House Council on Environmental Quality Chair Brenda
Mallory and Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American
cabinet secretary. “In the Pacific Northwest, an open and candid
conversation about the history and legacy of the federal government’s
management of the Columbia River is long overdue.”</p>
<p>Northwest Republicans in Congress and some business and utility
groups oppose breaching the dams, saying it would jeopardize an
important shipping route for farmers and throw off clean-energy goals.
GOP Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who represents eastern Washington,
called Tuesday’s report a “sham.”</p>
<p>“This bad faith report is just the latest in a long list of examples
that prove the Biden administration’s goal has always been dam
breaching,” she said in a written statement.</p>
<p>The document was a requirement of an agreement last year to halt
decades of legal fights over the operation of the dams. It lays out how
government and private interests in the early 20th century began walling
off the tributaries of the Columbia River, the largest in the Northwest,
to provide water for irrigation or flood control, compounding the damage
that was already being caused to water quality and salmon runs by
mining, logging and rapacious non-tribal salmon cannery operations.</p>
<p>The report was accompanied by the announcement of a new task force to
coordinate salmon recovery efforts across federal agencies.</p>
<p>Tribal representatives said they were gratified with the
administration’s formal, if long-belated, acknowledgment of how the U.S.
government ignored their treaty-based fishing rights and their concerns
about how the dams would affect their people.</p>
<p>“The salmon themselves have been suffering the consequences since the
dams first were put in,” said Shannon Wheeler, chairman of the Nez Perce
Tribe. “The lack of salmon eventually starts affecting us, but they’re
the ones who have been suffering the longest. … It feels like there’s an
opportunity to end the suffering.”</p>
<p>Salmon are born in rivers and migrate far downstream to the ocean,
where they spend their adult lives before returning to their natal
rivers to spawn and die. Dams can disrupt that by cutting off access to
upstream habitat and by slowing and warming water to the point that fish
die.</p>
<p>The Columbia River Basin, an area roughly the size of Texas, was once
the world’s greatest salmon-producing river system, with as many as 16
million salmon and steelhead returning every year to spawn.</p>
<p>Now, scientists say, about 2 million salmon and steelhead return to
the Columbia and its tributaries each year, about two-thirds of them
hatchery raised. The Shoshone-Bannock Tribe in southeastern Idaho said
it once harvested enough salmon for each tribal member to have 700
pounds of fish in a year. Today, the average harvest yields barely 1
pound per tribal member.</p>
<p>Of the 16 stocks of salmon and steelhead that once populated the
river system, four are extinct and seven are listed under the Endangered
Species Act.</p>
<p>Another iconic but endangered Northwest species, a population of
killer whales, also depend on the salmon.</p>
<p>There has been growing recognition across the U.S. that the harms
some dams cause to fish outweigh their usefulness. Dams on the Elwha
River in Washington state and the Klamath River along the
Oregon-California border have been or are being removed.</p>
<p>The construction of the first dams on the main Columbia River,
including the Grand Coulee and Bonneville dams in the 1930s, provided
jobs to a country grappling with the Great Depression, as well as
hydropower and navigation.</p>
<p>As early as the late 1930s, tribes were warning that the salmon runs
could disappear, with the fish no longer able to access spawning grounds
upstream. The tribes — the Yakama Nation, Spokane Tribe, confederated
tribes of the Colville and Umatilla reservations, Nez Perce, and others
— continued to fight the construction and operation of the dams for
generations.</p>
<p>Tom Iverson, regional coordinator for Yakama Nation Fisheries, said
that while the report was gratifying, it remains “hopes and promises”
until funding for salmon restoration and renewable power projects comes
through Congress.</p>
<p>“With these agreements, there is hope,” Iverson said. “We feel like
this is a moment in time. If it doesn’t happen now, it will be too
late.”</p>

approves $360 million arms sale to Taiwan for missiles, drones</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TAIPEI, Taiwan — The U.S. State Department has approved the possible
sale to Taiwan of drones and missiles for an estimated $360 million, the
Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency said.</p>
<p>The United States is bound by law to provide Chinese-claimed Taiwan
with the means to defend itself despite the lack of formal diplomatic
ties, to the constant anger of Beijing.</p>
<p>China has been stepping up military pressure against Taiwan,
including staging war games around the island last month after the
inauguration of Lai Ching-te as president.</p>
<p>The sale “will help improve the security of the recipient and assist
in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic
progress in the region,” the Pentagon agency said in separate statements
on Tuesday in the U.S.</p>
<p>The sale includes Switchblade 300 anti-personnel and anti-armor
loitering munitions and related equipment for an estimated cost of $60.2
million, and ALTIUS 600M-V drones and related equipment for an estimated
cost of $300 million, the agency added. Loitering munitions are small
guided missiles that can fly around a target area until they are
directed to attack.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s defense ministry expressed its thanks, especially for U.S.
efforts to increase arms sales to the island. Taiwan has repeatedly
complained of delayed deliveries.</p>
<p>“In the face of the Chinese communists’ frequent military operations
around Taiwan, these US-agreed-to arms sales items will have the ability
to detect and strike in real time, and can respond quickly to enemy
threats,” it said in a statement.</p>
<p>Peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait require goodwill from China,
the ministry added.</p>
<p>“It is hoped that the People’s Liberation Army will stop its
oppressive military operations around Taiwan and jointly contribute to
regional stability.”</p>

id="biden-extends-protections-to-undocumented-spouses-of-citizens">Biden
extends protections to undocumented spouses of citizens</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The White House — For Javier Quiroz Castro, entering America’s most
famous home was an impossible dream – his parents brought him to the
U.S. from Mexico at age 3, without legal immigration status. </p>
<p>But on Tuesday, in a blue suit with an American flag pinned to his
lapel, Quiroz Castro – now a registered nurse – spoke these words at the
White House. </p>
<p>“Growing up undocumented, it was not easy,” said the Houston
resident, who used the 12-year-old Deferred Action for Childhood
Arrivals program to change his status. “Like thousands of other
immigrants, my parents endured hard labor in order to provide for the
family. They are a symbol of the American dream.”</p>
<p>Beside him stood President Joe Biden, who used the 12-year
anniversary of that landmark immigration policy to announce a move to
offer protections to undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens. The new move
could affect approximately half a million spouses of U.S. citizens, plus
50,000 noncitizen children who have a parent married to a U.S.
citizen. </p>
<p>“These couples have been raising families, sending their kids to
church and school, paying taxes, contributing to our country for 10
years or more,” Biden said. “And as a matter of a fact, the average time
they’ve spent here is 23 years, the people that are affected today.
They’ve been living in the United States all this time, in fear and
uncertainty. We can fix that. And that’s what I’m going to do
today.”</p>
<p>But, as the White House laid out in its fact sheet on the
announcement, it is a bit more complicated. </p>
<p>To be eligible, a person must have lived in the U.S. for 10-plus
years and be legally married to a citizen. It is retroactive – only
those married before June 17, 2024, qualify. </p>
<p>Those who meet those two criteria – and whose application is approved
by the Department of Homeland Security – then have three years to apply
for permanent residency. They will be allowed to remain in the U.S.,
with their families, and be eligible for work authorization during this
time.</p>
<p>Also included in Tuesday’s announcement is a plan to accelerate the
process of obtaining work visas for certain DACA recipients who have a
U.S. degree and an employment offer relating to their field. </p>
<p>Both Biden and his main challenger have repeatedly brought up
immigration on the stump, and Biden has made several recent moves on
immigration, including a recent executive order that will temporarily
restrict asylum eligibility at the U.S.-Mexico border whenever the
number of migrants crossing unlawfully or without authorization reaches
a daily average of 2,500. Those who cross the border illegally won’t be
eligible for asylum unless there are extraordinary reasons why they
should be allowed to stay.</p>
<p>For many American voters in a tight election year, immigration is a
more cleanly divisive topic that falls neatly along party lines. The
divide was reflected in the wildly divergent reactions from two
representatives from the border state of Texas. </p>
<p>“I applaud the Biden-Harris administration for heeding the call of so
many of us to use its executive authority to keep American families
together, support our Dreamers in the workforce, and boost our economy,”
Democratic congresswoman Sylvia Garcia said in a statement. </p>
<p>Whereas Ted Cruz, the Canada-born junior Republican senator from
Texas, said: “While our border is being overrun by ISIS terrorists and
cartel criminals, Joe Biden’s top priority is to give amnesty to illegal
aliens. He has utterly abandoned the American people. This amnesty
program allows illegal aliens to get citizenship and vote in future
elections. Make no mistake: Joe Biden views every illegal alien as a
future Democrat voter.” </p>
<p>And Republican candidate Donald Trump has gone further. He blames
both Biden’s policies and immigrants in general – often without clear
evidence, and sometimes in the face of facts – for a number of ills,
including crime, inflation, and even disease and terrorism. </p>
<p>“This is a Biden migrant invasion,” Trump said at a recent campaign
event. “An estimated 50% of inflation has been caused by the soaring
cost of housing which is skyrocketing due to Joe Biden’s tidal wave of
illegal immigration and high interest rates.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt accused Biden
of using this sensitive issue to gain votes.</p>
<p>“Biden only cares about one thing — power — and that’s why he is
giving mass amnesty and citizenship to hundreds of thousands of illegals
who he knows will ultimately vote for him and the Open Border Democrat
Party,” she said, echoing some of Trump’s concerns about the economy.
“Biden has created another invitation for illegal immigration through
his mass amnesty order.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Immigration advocates disagree, saying research shows that those who
benefit from this policy contribute about $13 billion in spending power
to the U.S. economy each year. </p>
<p>“We estimate that if they were to be U.S. citizens years down the
line, they could actually increase that amount by about $5 billion each
year,” Phillip Connor, a senior demographer at bipartisan
immigration-advocacy group FWD.us, told VOA. </p>
<p>“These individuals are already working in industries that already
have labor shortages with some kind of legal status that will be
permitted through this policy that will allow them to go into careers
that are barred from them right now, and to be more productive into our
economy, which will be beneficial for their families, but also
beneficial for our society as a whole,” Connor said.</p>
<p>And families affected by these policies say they can’t put a price on
it. </p>
<p>Rebecca Shi’s mother was undocumented for nearly two decades –
gaining legal status changed her life. </p>
<p>“She was a doctor in China, but for 19 years, undocumented here, so
she worked in Chinese restaurants, she worked in nursing homes, caring
for the elderly and emptying bedpans and wasn’t able to practice her
profession,” Shi, who is executive director of the American Business
Immigration Coalition, told VOA. </p>
<p>“And so when she was able to get parole in place and get her Green
Card, she went back to the medical field and it’s been thrilling and
deeply humanizing for her and just showing that when you legalize people
who are here for decades already contributing, you unleash their
economic potential, and that’s good for every American,” Shi said.</p>
<p>Quiroz Castro echoed that thought, telling the friendly crowd of
congressional Democrats, immigration advocates and immigrants how he
worked to return the warm embrace he got from the country he calls
home.</p>
<p>“Being a nurse has allowed me to give back to my community while
supporting my family especially during the pandemic, I helped take care
of patients in our COVID-19 critical care unit,” he said. “Saving
American lives was only possible because of DACA. It allowed me to live
and work and build a family in the only country I have ever known and
loved.”</p>

Postgres Ibiza 2024 builds on the success of the last editions (2023 and
