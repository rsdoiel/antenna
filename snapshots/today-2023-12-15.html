<h2 id="hex-time">Hex time</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-15, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Hex time
</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>
My wife left to spend the day in a spa with a friend of hers and I am
listening to Louis Armstrong recordings from the 1930s.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I read a discussion between
<a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@munroe" title="@munroe@dice.camp"><span
class="citation" data-cites="munroe">@munroe</span></a> and
<a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@Da_Gut" title="@Da_Gut@dice.camp"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Da_Gut">@Da_Gut</span></a> about hex sizes
for a hexcrawl. My personal take is to think of hexes as distances one
can travel in a certain time.
</p>
<p>
Think about the diversity of the landscape one can see in a day of
travel. Arable lands and a forest. Two regions? Arable lands, a forest,
hills, a plateau. Four? That is the number of hexes per day. And nobody
cares about the miles.
</p>
<p>
In my case, I think that “one hex is one day of walking” makes the most
sense. In the morning, you’re leaving one hex and in the afternoon
you’re arriving in the next hex. This assumes an uncharted wilderness.
When I try to leave the forest trails in the hills around Zürich or in
the Swiss mountains, I feel that progress is really slow. Super slow.
Extremely slow. Sure, I can walk as far as the horizon in some cases,
but that’s on gravel roads prepared by industrial machines and
maintained by a state that is fed by all the tax evading billionaires
and conglomerates of the whole planet. So out there in Fantasy land,
it’s more like me trying to find a shortcut in the Swiss mountains and
forests.
</p>
<p>
And sure, if people have horses and mules to carry their stuff, they can
travel faster. Twice as fast makes it easy to move the little token
around on the map. And roads also speed things up. Like, twice as fast?
With horses and mules to carry stuff, on a flat road: 4 hexes per day.
If you want to read up on ancient rows, see
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_roads_and_trails">historic
roads and trails</a> on Wikipedia.
</p>
<p>
Regular exploration of the wilderness where the players are strangers,
intruders, colonizers, potential murderers, belonging to the
wannabe-conquerors, then surely it’s going to be 1 hex per day. This is
the equivalent of slow and careful dungeon exploration speed. Avoid
getting lost in the bogs, crossing the rivers and creeks without losing
your stuff, without getting ambushed in gullies and canyons, without
getting lost in forests, without slipping into ravines, spraining angles
or scraping your knees, keeping dry, finding good camping sites, digging
a latrine, digging a fire pit, washing clothes, maintaining equipment,
baking bread, and on and on. This is the speed you can maintain for long
expeditions.
</p>
<p>
Now, you can get into all the nitty-gritty of it all. Luckily,
<a class="account" href="https://rollenspiel.social/@settembrini" title="@settembrini@rollenspiel.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="settembrini">@settembrini</span></a>
already did all that and wrote
<a href="https://hofrat.rsp-blogs.de/2023/12/01/inch-by-inch-its-all-a-cinch-by-the-yard-its-hard/">Inch
by inch it’s all a cinch, by the yard it’s hard</a>. It’s a long article
and not an easy read. But here’s one of the things I can put into my
gamer notes:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
1 hour’s walk = 1 league = 3 miles = 3000 double paces = 15 000 feet=
5000 yards.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So let’s go back to my example. Using the above equivalences, 8 hours of
walking takes you 24 miles out in the open, on a road or well kept and
straight trail. At the same time, I said that 1 day of walking is 2
hexes in my world, without mules or horses. So now we know: one day of
walking is 24 miles and 2 hexes. Therefore my hexes should be 12 miles
across, if you really need to know.
</p>
<p>
But of course you don’t because nothing happens “per mile” in the game.
All the things happen “per unit of time”. The most important one of
these is “how many random encounters per day?” Or “per 4 hour watch?”
</p>
<p>
I’m serious about one thing, however: It’s better if you don’t think
about the miles per hex. If you do, you’ll keep thinking about all the
other things, too. How far was your hike last summer? Did you have to
set up camp? How heavy was your backpack? Did you wear armour? Is
travelling by horse really faster than walking by foot if you can’t
switch horses? How fast are you if you have two horses per person? How
fast is a wagon. The questions are endless and somehow I find them all
very boring questions. These are not
<a href="2023-01-20_The_power_of_questions.md">good questions</a>.
</p>
<p>
It’s better if you think about what’s important in the game for you and
the table and go from there. Is the world dangerous because of random
encounters? Start with the question of how often you want to roll for
random encounters as the party travels from landmark to landmark. Think
about the distances between settlements. Traditionally, that would be
about a day’s march by foot in arable land: half a day out and do a bit
of work and half a day back is the limit.
</p>
<p>
So let’s say you answered the above with “I’m going to roll once for
random encounters per day of travel”. And every landmark has something:
either it’s arable land so there are people living there, a camp, a
hamlet, a village, or it’s dangerous because of a monster lair, or
because of a natural hazard like mountains, swamps, deep forest, or
something else that’s similarly inhospitable.
</p>
<p>
If you follow this train of thought then you’ll arrive at my setup: the
slowest speed is one hex per day, and then there are ways to speed
things up with transporation methods and infrastructure. Take a boat
downriver or along the coast: 8 hexes per day? More? What about taking a
boat upriver? Just as slow as walking but you can unlimited supplies?
How far can the flying carpet go? All these questions need settling,
eventually. All I am concerned about right now, however, is that they
can be answered in principle: a certain multiple of the slowest speed is
good enough.
</p>
<p>
The only good argument for switching things up that I can think of is
wanting to present more variety to your players. No problem. If the land
is full of stuff, a river ford, a tower ruin, then up onto the plateau
and into the moors until you reach the cairns of Arguable, you can scale
it up. Multiply it all by two or three or four and you’re good to go. I
find that this leads to a lot more mapping and so I don’t do it, but if
you feel like it, you have my blessings.
</p>
<p>
If you are like me and prefer more diversity in theory but cannot be
bothered to map in practice, I have a suggestion: start with the sparse
map and keep adding. Using the example above, there’s a hex with a
settlement, and the next hex is hills, and there’s a river between the
two. You can improvise a story about the fields giving way to brushland,
the river winding its way between the willows and the ford with the
poles of King Borgobob who raised them in the times of your grandfather,
and then there’s that plateau. If the players don’t look for the tower,
it does not show up. But if the players know about the old tower you add
a tower symbol to the hill hex and presto, one more landmark in the same
hex. They know about the cairn, too? Then it’s a tower and a cairn. You
can even number the sides of a hex: 1 is north, 2 is south-east, 3 is
south-west, and so on. Then your notes can say “1: cairn, 4: old tower”
and depending on how the party crosses the hexes, you’ll know whether
they pass by the thing or wether they can spot it from a distance or
whether they’ll have to search for it.
</p>
<p>
I also like to label geographic features. Label settlements, forests,
mountains, swamps, rivers, trails. I feel that adds so much.
</p>
<p>
Here’s a snapshot of the player map in my German Greyhawk campaign where
I run the Elredd region on the Wild Coast. How long does it take to
travel from Elredd to Moorwies along the Miesbohlenweg? 1 hex/day in the
wilderness, 2 hexes/day on the road: From Elredd to Brackmühl is a day,
from Brackmühl to Kreuzdorf is a day, and from Kreuzdorf to Moorwies is
half a day, or perhaps the swamp slows things down and the road is shit
so it’s a full day. So three days total. If you had horses, then it’s
one day from Elredd to Kreuzdorf, and then the shit trackway into the
swamp… a second day? Or maybe you can travel right through Moorwies and
out of the swamp on the other side. But my players don’t know what lies
to the west…

<strong></strong>Global demand for coal remains at a record high, but is
expected to start declining in 2026, according to the International
Energy Agency’s (IEA)
“<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=a024676a3c&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Coal

fossil fuels: Coal consumption fell by about 20% in the United States
and the European Union this year. But the same cannot be said for China,
India, and Southeast Asia, where coal demand is growing. But a turning
point could arrive soon, the report says. Global coal demand is expected
to fall by 2.3% by 2026 compared with 2023 levels. A lot depends on
China, which accounts for 54% of global coal consumption.

released yesterday, the White House said workers should travel by train
for trips shorter than 250 miles, and especially in the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic, where rail travel is most accessible. If traveling by car
is necessary, workers should opt for an EV. Employees should consider
combining trips, taking public transportation, and avoid using their own
private vehicles for work. Or better yet, they should avoid traveling at
all. “In every case, the trip not taken is the least expensive and most
sustainable,” the directive says. The federal government spent $1.66
billion on flights and $4.2 million on rail trips last year,

<strong></strong>The glacier beneath Everest Base Camp is melting due to
rising temperatures in the Himalayas, putting climbers at risk and

Everest tourism contributed $2.4 billion to Nepal’s economy last year,
which is 6.1% of its GDP, and Base Camp is an essential gateway to the
mountain. But ice at the camp is disappearing due to a combination of
global warming and human activity. Moving the camp farther down the
mountain is an option, but it would “make the climb to the top more
dangerous than it already is,” the <em>Journal</em> explains. More
people died on Mount Everest this year than ever before. A

World</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-15, updated: 2023-12-08, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
In 2016, I wrote about an Internet that affected the world in a direct,
physical manner. It was connected to your smartphone. It had sensors
like cameras and thermostats. It had actuators: Drones, autonomous cars.
And it had smarts in the middle, using sensor data to figure out what to
do and then actually do it. This was the Internet of Things (IoT).
</p>
<p>
The classical definition of a robot is something that senses, thinks,
and acts—that’s today’s Internet. We’ve been building a world-sized
robot without even realizing it.
</p>
<p>
In 2023, we upgraded the “thinking” part with large-language models
(LLMs) like GPT. ChatGPT both surprised and amazed the world with its
ability to understand human language and generate credible, on-topic,
humanlike responses. But what these are really good at is interacting
with systems formerly designed for humans. Their accuracy will get
better, and they will be used to replace actual humans…

I ask interesting people to talk about themselves and their blogs. Today
we have Jamie Thingelstad and his blog,

</p>
<p>
Jamie was the first person to
<a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">become
a supporter of the P&amp;B series</a>, even before the first edition was
out, something I really appreciate. I really enjoy how his blog is a
proper personal blog, with a mix of work related content, things he’s
passionate about, family posts, and everything in between. It’s also
great how he’s been online with a blog for almost two decades, quite a
stark contrast with the current state of the web where things tend to
last 12 nanoseconds on average. And lastly, I love that his entire
family has blogs. It’s such a neat idea.

<strong>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce
yourself?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Hello there! My name is Jamie Thingelstad, and I’m writing to you from
Minneapolis, Minnesota, in the United States. Thank You, Manuel, for
having me and thank you for reading! I’m happily married to my fantastic
partner Tammy, and we have two children, Mazie and Tyler. Our family
unit is rounded out with our
<a href="https://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/bernedoodle/">Bernedoodle</a>
Lucky, who is equal parts loving, lazy, and large.
</p>
<p>
I am a passionate technologist and have been intrigued by computers
since my mother got me a Texas Instruments
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-99/4A">TI-99/4A</a> for $99 at
JC Penney when they were exiting the computer business. My Uncle Tim
helped me take that Christmas present, attach the RF modulator to a TV,
and create my first BASIC program. I’ve been fascinated by technology my
whole life. When I discovered the Internet at the
<a href="https://cse.umn.edu/cs">University of Minnesota</a>, in the
days of FTP and Gopher, when the Web was still being born, I was
smitten. While many undergrads were spending Friday nights out and
about, I could often be found on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARCstation">SPARCstation</a> in
the labs, learning Unix and exploring the early Internet.
</p>
<p>
I was lucky enough to start my career along with the Web. I left the
University before completing my degree. I started an Internet Service
Provider for businesses, helped build
<a href="https://bigcharts.marketwatch.com">BigCharts</a> as CTO, and
led our technology into
<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com">MarketWatch</a> and, finally
<a href="https://www.dowjones.com">Dow Jones</a>. I’ve spent significant
time in publishing, financial services, social, and retail Software as a
Service. Today, I am CTO for <a href="https://www.spscommerce.com">SPS
Commerce</a>, leading a team of 500 technologists to build and grow the
World’s Retail Network.
</p>
<p>
While my role is about leadership, I remain very close to technology.
Some folks have hobbies like gardening, and mine are mostly around
technology. I’m an active blogger. I
<a href="https://weekly.thingelstad.com">write a newsletter</a>. I love
to explore and play with tech. Overall, I like learning. I enjoy
photography to push my creative side. I enjoy writing. I enjoy cooking
and entertaining.
<a href="https://www.thingelstad.com/categories/candles/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">I
make candles</a>. We enjoy traveling both near and far.
</p>
<p>
Most of all, I enjoy time with family and friends.

<strong>What's the story behind your blog?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I started my blog nearly 20 years ago, and I don’t remember the impetus
to create it. I registered <code>thingelstad.com</code> in 1999, even
before I set up my blog. I had a handmade HTML “home page” and other
hand-created HTML pages for some trips. In 2004, I decided to start
using .Text as a blogging system. I’ve used a variety of different
technologies over the years.

</p>
<p>
For nearly two decades, my blog has been my home on the Web. It is where
I share my writing. It is where I record things I care about. There
isn’t a single story of my blog. There are hundreds. And that is what I
love about it.
</p>
<p>
Having published for this long and now in my fifties, I think of my blog
as one of my “life works.” It is part of my long-term memory. It is part
of how I want to leave an impact on the future.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to
blogging?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
“Creative process” is a pretty big word for my blogging. I tend to write
on the fly when I find the energy and motivation flowing. My blogging is
often things that happen in my life, stories I want to share, or my
opinions. I don’t do a lot of research, but I do make sure I add links
to related websites.
</p>
<p>
Short posts I do right in the
<a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> app. Longer posts I will
write in <a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a>. I typically author
posts in one sitting. I prefer to do any final editing after the post is
published. Longer posts I will often read the next day on my site and
will make edits at that point.
</p>
<p>
I do have lists of blog posts I may want to write, and they are usually
in <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> in a
“Create blog posts” project, or I will have a stub in Drafts in the
“Blog/Ideas” tag. Most of these “ideas” never actually go anywhere. The
posts that happen the most are the ones that I feel compelled to write
about.
</p>
<p>
Building this need to write is something I recognized that Twitter was
hurting. I’m not sure how to explain it, but over time,
<a href="https://www.thingelstad.com/2017/02/18/creativity-vampires.html">I
feel compelled to write</a>. I realized after a long time (too long)
that blabbing 140 characters at a time on Twitter was scratching that
same itch. Still, the outcome was just these blips of words disconnected
from context. When I do less of that, the “urge to write” builds, and
before I know it, I’m writing 1,000 words on something.
</p>
<p>
One last thing is I don’t ever use “Drafts” in the blogging platform I’m
using. I’m unsure why, but creating a draft in the system is like death
for that post. It will never happen. For some reason, keeping that in
the Drafts app or a list in OmniFocus works much better. I never use the
Draft feature of micro.blog or other blogging systems.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe
the physical space influences your creativity?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
For me it is less about the physical where (beyond basic comfort) and
more about the when. My most prolific time for writing things of any
length is on a weekend morning. Coffee nearby, everyone else still
asleep, and the sun low in the sky. Usually, I’m on my laptop, but a
desktop is fine. I’m nearly always going to be typing into Drafts. I
have an outline I’m working to fill out.
</p>
<p>
The physical space can have an impact. If things are cluttered or
distracting, that takes energy away. But that has a minor effect on me.
It is all about energy, and that is most present in the morning for me.
</p>
<p>
That said, I’m okay writing at any other time, but I may prefer shorter
or simpler things.
</p>
<p>
Mostly, “just write”.

tech stack?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Here is my current setup for running my blog.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://micro.blog"><strong>Micro.blog</strong></a>: I use
micro.blog as a blog publishing service. Micro.blog is the idea of
<a href="https://www.manton.org">Manton Reece</a> (the
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-manton-reece">first People &amp;
Blogs interview</a>). When micro.blog was launched, I intended to use it
as an alternative to Twitter. But then, as Manton built and improved the
system, I realized it could host my entire site. I now have 8,449 posts
in micro.blog and growing, with a total blog archive size of over 7 GB.
It makes me chuckle since I think the “micro” in micro.blog makes folks
think they can’t use it for everything, but you can. It works great, and
it is the lowest friction way for me to “just write.” I’ve been
<a href="https://www.thingelstad.com/2021/04/28/four-great-years.html">delighted</a>
with it.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.namecheap.com"><strong>Namecheap</strong></a>: This
is my domain registrar of choice. There is nothing special about it, but
I find their system easy, and the advanced DNS hosting has the features
I need.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://mattlangford.com/tiny-theme/"><strong>Tiny
Theme</strong></a>: <a href="https://mattlangford.com/">Matt
Langford</a> made the theme I’m using with Micro.blog, and I like it a
lot. It is just the right amount of simplicity and function for what I
need. The Micro.blog theme ecosystem is indeed “micro,” but Tiny Theme
would stand out in any collection.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Plugins</strong>: I use Search Page, Open Graph Cards, Surprise
Me!, Reply by Email, Conversation on Micro.blog, and Meta Tags.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/cleverdevil/micromemories"><strong>micromemories</strong></a>:
This powers my “<a href="https://www.thingelstad.com/on-this-day/">On
This Day</a>” page that shows only blog posts from the current day. I
visit this page nearly daily, which is my primary way to do
<a href="https://www.thingelstad.com/2023/09/04/blog-gardening.html">Blog
Gardening</a>.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Micro.blog Apps</strong> (iOS, macOS): This is how I do most of
my “on the go” quick posts with a photo or two. I also use this to send
my longer blog posts, but I don’t write them in this app. I instead
write them in Drafts and then copy/paste them into the app to send.
<em>Pro-Tip: You can use the macOS app to schedule posts in the future,
but did you know you can also “schedule” them for the past? I will
sometimes post something about an event that happened a couple of days
ago and use the Schedule feature to set the date to what I want instead
of now.</em>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://samgrover.studio/apps/mimi"><strong>Mimi
Uploader</strong></a>: Posting one or two images is easy enough with the
normal apps, but if you want to share a gallery of images, Mimi is
amazing. Mimi deserves special recognition because it is one of the
things that helped me realize micro.blog isn’t so micro. If I need to
get several images up on my blog, Mimi is my tool of choice. Related to
this, I don’t use any gallery javascript plugins. I prefer to have the
images simply in the post. The web browser has a wonderful gallery and
slideshow feature — called the scroll bar. :-)
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://getdrafts.com"><strong>Drafts</strong></a>: The tagline
for Drafts is “Where Text Starts” and it is where I do nearly all of my
starting of text. I’m writing this interview response in Drafts right
now. I have tags in drafts for my blog that are mostly “blog ideas” that
could be just a couple sentences about something I might want to write
about or “blog drafts” that are fleshed out a bit more. I am light on
the process here, but all of my writing that is longer than a couple
sentences happens in Drafts.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Micro.blog Exports</strong>: Lastly, it is essential to make
sure you have all your writing, so I regularly export my blog from
micro.blog and keep it locally. It is critical to have this as part of
your stack.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would
you do anything differently?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Having blogged for nearly two decades, I get asked for suggestions about
how to start a blog, and my main point of advice is just one thing:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Just write.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Most people get hung up on “write about what?” I suggest writing about
something they recently learned or experienced. Start as a journal and
keep writing. Over time, you will find your voice and the topics or
themes that resonate with you. But the most important thing is to write.
Everything else is noise.
</p>
<p>
For folks who agree with the above, I have three suggestions.
</p>
<p>
First, embrace the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a>
principle. Blogging platforms have a ton of options and customizations.
I would ignore them all. One of the things I love about the modern
pattern of using markdown and site generators is its simplicity.
Customizations to a specific system are to be avoided, and for sure,
ignore theme customizations. You will change themes, and you don’t want
any content dependencies.
</p>
<p>
Second, I’ve found Collections and Lists to be a fun thing on my blog.
Like most blogging systems micro.blog allows for posts by date or pages
using a manual structure.
<a href="https://www.thingelstad.com/collections/">Collections</a> are
pages that I create to collect a set of blog posts together. You could
think of them as a category, but they are usually time-bound events like
<a href="https://www.thingelstad.com/collections/yellowstone-2020/">a
trip to Yellowstone</a>. Having a page I can add content to and link to
is a great way to curate a set of posts on something and add additional
context about it. <a href="https://www.thingelstad.com/lists/">Lists</a>
use the same page function and are just various lists like a
<a href="https://www.thingelstad.com/lists/escape-rooms">list of escape
rooms</a>, a <a href="https://www.thingelstad.com/lists/words">list of
words</a>, and
<a href="https://www.thingelstad.com/lists/poap-events/">a list of POAP
events I’ve created</a>. Both of these pages are in the navigation of my
site, and I’ve had people comment on how much they like them.
</p>
<p>
The last suggestion is to only have one site, one blog. This goes back
to my main thing about “just write”. Having multiple websites adds a
decision point of “write where?”. I find this question to be a big
problem, and it stops me in my tracks. It’s best to have only one place
that you write so there is no decision.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Financial question since the Web is obsessed with money: how
much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost, or does it
generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetizing
personal blogs?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Running thingelstad.com requires two things: a subscription to
micro.blog and my domain name. I subscribe to the premium version of
micro.blog more because I want to support the business than share
videos, which is $100/year. I manage my domain registration with
NameCheap, which is approximately $16/year. I also defensively own
<code>thinglestad.com</code> (the most common misspelling of my name)
and <code>jamiethingelstad.com</code>, which redirects, but that is an
optional spend.
</p>
<p>
I love that micro.blog gives you an on-ramp to blogging for as low as
$5/mo or $50 + domain name annually. That is a great deal.
</p>
<p>
I do not try to make money off of my blog at all. Like most bloggers,
when affiliate stuff was big, I did try it. I even had a couple of hobby
sites that
<a href="https://www.thingelstad.com/2008/04/26/just-got-anothe.html">I
ran Google AdWords on</a>. That was all before I developed as informed
and vigorous a view on privacy as I do now. And in the early days,
affiliate and ad networks were not the surveillance systems they are
now.
</p>
<p>
I also
<a href="https://www.thingelstad.com/2017/12/05/removed-google-analytics.html">do
not have any analytics on my website</a>.
</p>
<p>
My metaphor to think about all of this stuff is my home. I like to think
of people visiting my blog as a digital version of somebody coming over
for dinner or stopping by to visit. I do not give people who come to our
house a unique identifier and follow them around after they leave. I
don’t provide them with coupons or ask if they bought the book we
discussed. And I don’t keep counters of how long they stay or if they
“bounced” right after stopping by.
</p>
<p>
I want to respect the people who visit my site and respect their
privacy, so I don’t monetize any aspect of it and have no tracking codes
at all.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Time for some recommendations: Is there any blog you think is
worth checking? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing
next?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I must first recommend the blogs of
<a href="https://tammy.thingelstad.com">Tammy</a> and my kids,
<a href="https://mazie.thingelstad.com">Mazie</a> and
<a href="https://tyler.thingelstad.com">Tyler</a>. A long time ago,
Tammy had a blog that she posted somewhat regularly with the delightful
name “Smaller Than A Redwood.” She took the site off the Web several
years ago, and a couple years back I asked her if she would mind me
resurrecting it back into micro.blog via the backup I took. She thought
fine, and then, out of the blue this summer on our vacation, she made
her first post in about 10 years.
</p>
<p>
I also set my kids up with their own blogs. All of them are on
micro.blog. They don’t post regularly, and I’m not pushing them. I’m
vocal about my disdain for social media, and my kids have absorbed that
opinion. Neither of them wants anything to do with those services. So
we’ve set them up with a way to authentically publish online if or when
the spirit moves them. They have it available to use as they wish.
</p>
<p>
Also, here are some bloggers that I particularly get excited about when
I see a new item appear in my feed:
<a href="https://allenpike.com">Allen Pike</a>,
<a href="https://om.co">Om Malik</a>,
<a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim Bray</a>,
<a href="https://bernoff.com/blog">Josh Bernoff</a>,
<a href="https://avc.com">Fred Wilson</a>,
<a href="https://rajiv.com">Rajiv Pant</a>,
<a href="https://anniemueller.com">Annie Mueller</a>,
<a href="https://leezukor.com">Lee Zukor</a>,
<a href="https://slowperc.blogspot.com">David O’Hara</a>, and
<a href="https://www.patrickrhone.net">Patrick Rhone</a>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with
us?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Over 6 years ago, I decided to explore having a newsletter. I’d been
blogging for 13 years then, so I had a consistent stream of things I was
writing. I also had been a broad reader and curating links for years. I
decided to bring those things as the core of the
<a href="https://weekly.thingelstad.com">Weekly Thing</a>. The name is a
play on my last name, and it is weekly. I’ve published over 250 issues,
and many people refer to the Weekly Thing as my “blog.”
</p>
<p>
Publishing a newsletter has been an exciting journey and is similar to
blogging but also very different. There is a reply mechanism that blogs
don’t have. There is no need for a feed reader to get to people. I like
it and find it a great complement to my blog. I’m also honored to have
over 1,400 people who have decided to let me into their mailbox. I don’t
know how many people subscribe to my RSS feed, but I suspect that the
Weekly Thing is now the most common way people “subscribe” to my blog.
</p>
<p>
I also recently
<a href="https://www.thingelstad.com/2023/10/21/road-sign-math.html">rebooted
a fun hobby site</a> of mine —
<a href="https://www.roadsignmath.xyz">Road Sign Math</a>! This is a
driving game we’ve played as a family for years. At one point, I had a
complicated website running for it with multiple players and a
leaderboard. I even transitioned it from a blog to a wiki. I took it and
many other sites off the Web a long time ago, but mathematically
significant road signs still delighted me, so I decided to bring it back
with a reboot using micro.blog. It is a fun site, a great time on road
trips, and my little contribution to keeping the Web weird.
</p>
<p>
I’d also put a plug out for book clubs. I’ve been
<a href="https://www.thingelstad.com/projects/book-club/">in a book
club</a> for years with four other super-intelligent people, and reading
and discussing books has been an incredible learning process and a great
social connection. If you can be in a book club, leap at it. Or even
better, start your own.
</p>
<p>
I love to learn and believe it is part of my purpose. I greatly enjoy
(and subscribe) to two podcasts I learn from:
<a href="https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/making-sense-episodes">Making
Sense</a> by Sam Harris and
<a href="https://peterattiamd.com/category/podcast/">The Drive</a> with
Peter Attia. The <a href="https://weekly.thingelstad.com">Weekly
Thing</a> is my attempt to share my learning with others. Overall, the
community of bloggers is a community of learners.
</p>
<p>
The thing I want to share the most, though, is gratitude. How fortunate
I was to watch the Web coming to life when I was at the University of
Minnesota in the early 1990’s. How incredible it is to get to experience
all of this technology. How lucky I am to be able to type on my laptop
on a weekend morning and have those words appear anywhere in the world
instantly. How honored that people actually read those words. And how my
kid’s kids and their descendants may even be able to read them after I’m
gone.
</p>
<p>
That is truly remarkable, and I can’t thank the Internet, the Web, and
the amazing world it created enough.

<p>date: 2023-12-15, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Donald Trump&amp;#8217;s campaign plans to significantly ramp up activity in Iowa during the first two weeks of January, according to people familiar with the matter, a move to ensure the former president delivers a knockout blow in the first Republican nominating contest of 2024. Dozens of Trump allies and advisers over the next month will appeal to Hawkeye State caucus-goers at rallies and events, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss the plans. The effort is expected to kick off in the next week, with stops planned in the cities of Council Bluffs, Waukee and Cedar Rapids, and then accelerate in the new year. Trump supporters hitting the campaign trail in Iowa include Ben Carson, Trump&amp;#8217;s former Housing and Urban Development Secretary, Florida Representative Matt Gaetz, who led efforts to oust Kevin McCarthy as House Speaker, and Texas Representative Wesley Hunt.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Today is one of those days when the main story is not what’s on the
pages, but what the stories say when they are themselves seen as a
pattern. This morning the Associated Press ran a story by national
political reporter Brian Slodysko titled “The Republican leading the
probe of Hunter Biden has his own shell company and complicated
friends.” It told the story of how Representative James Comer (R-KY),
the chair of the House Oversight Committee, has a financial history that
looks a great deal like that of which he accuses the Bidens, including a
shell company that appears to ethics experts to have problematic
connections to a campaign donor.</p>

id="education-faith-leaders-denounce-planned-satan-club-at-us-elementary-school">Education,
Faith Leaders Denounce Planned Satan Club at US Elementary School</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MEMPHIS, Tenn. — Faith and education leaders are denouncing plans for
an After School Satan Club at a Tennessee elementary school but said
they would follow the law and allow the organization hosting the club to
meet.</p>
<p>Around 40 members of the faith community in Memphis stood united with
leaders at Memphis-Shelby County Schools on Wednesday to criticize the
planned club and to question The Satanic Temple’s intentions in offering
it, according to the Commercial Appeal newspaper. The faith community
and educators also wanted to make it clear that students would need
signed permission slips to attend and to express support for religious
organizations that have partnered with the district, the newspaper
reported.</p>
<p>“You see the faith-based community standing here,” said board chair
and local pastor Althea Greene, who wore a clerical collar. “We’re going
to stand up and we’re going to be vocal. Satan has no room in this
district.”</p>
<p>The Satanic Temple plans to host the club at Chimneyrock Elementary
School in Cordova. It will begin meeting January 10 in the school’s
library and run through the spring semester, according to an
announcement Tuesday posted on social media.</p>
<p>A flyer about the club says the Satanic Temple is a nontheistic
religion that views Satan “as a literary figure who represents a
metaphorical construct of rejecting tyranny and championing the human
mind and spirit.”</p>
<p>It says it does not attempt to convert children to any religious
ideology but offers activities that “emphasize a scientific,
rationalistic, non-superstitious worldview.”</p>
<p>Memphis-Shelby County Schools said in a statement that the district
would rent out the space to the nonprofit organization per its
policy.</p>
<p>Since the announcement, interim Superintendent Toni Williams said
some have demanded that the district ban all faith-based organizations
from schools, but that won’t happen.</p>
<p>“As a superintendent, I am duty bound to uphold our board policy,
state laws, and the Constitution,” she said during the event. “But let’s
not be fooled. Let’s not be fooled by what we’ve seen in the past 24
hours, which is an agenda, initiated to make sure that we cancel all
faith-based organizations that partner with our district.”</p>

Invests in Africa in Effort to Counter Chinese Influence</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States has struck hundreds of deals worth
$14.2 billion with African nations over the past year as Washington
tries to counter growing influence on the continent by China.</p>
<p>The 547 new trade and investment agreements represent a 67% increase
from 2022 in the number and value of closed deals, according to British
Robinson, coordinator for the Prosper Africa trade and business
initiative, a program that connects U.S. and African businesses.</p>
<p>Robinson said the presidential and national security initiative is
aimed at strengthening strategic and economic partnerships by mobilizing
two-way trade and investment flow, and young people are key to realizing
that goal.</p>
<p>“The U.S. business and investment community is increasingly
recognizing Africa’s extraordinary market potential and dynamism. The
continent is home to the world’s youngest population, an asset that
creates significant opportunities for viable business deals that create
jobs and foster shared prosperity,” Robinson said during a December 12
virtual media briefing.</p>
<p>Judd Devermont, U.S. National Security Council senior director for
African Affairs, said it has been a record-setting year for U.S.-Africa
relations, with the United States following through on its commitment to
invest some $55 billion over three years.</p>
<p>“As we wind down 2023, we have already delivered on more than 40% of
this commitment. In fact, by the end of year two, we anticipate
surpassing 70% of our goal, if not more,” Devermont said. “With these
resources, we’ve expanded our trade and investment; we have advanced
major food and health security partnerships; charted a course for
digital transformation; forged new security and good governance
cooperation; and catalyzed landmark diaspora-driven engagement.”</p>
<p>The briefing was held to mark the one-year anniversary of the
U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington, where Biden pledged to go “all
in” on the continent.</p>
<p>The announcement comes as Washington works to deepen its engagement
with Africa, where China has been expanding its influence with
infrastructure, investment, loans, among other initiatives.</p>
<p>Devermont, President Joe Biden’s top Africa adviser, said Africa is
not only important economically but politically, adding the U.S. has
been pushing for more African voices on the world stage for some
time.</p>
<p>“President Biden last year called for the African Union to become a
permanent member of the G20, and in September we proudly welcomed this
development,” Devermont said. “We’re now advocating for a third seat for
the —for Sub-Saharan Africa on the IMF board, and of course we reiterate
our call for permanent representation for Africa at the UN Security
Council.”</p>
<p>The U.S. has had to alter its investment and trade strategies in
countries affected by conflict. U.S. Department of State Bureau of
African Affairs Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Jonathan
Pratt said that, in Sudan, U.S. policy has been to put sanctions in
place. “Sanctions haven’t just been on individuals; they’ve also been on
companies and different asset classes. And so that’s one strategy that
we’ve used in conflict countries and locations,” he said.</p>
<p>Pratt said in Niger, one of several countries hit by military coups
and violence, the United States is prioritizing peace through
negotiations.</p>
<p>“We’ve been very supporting of the ECOWAS (Economic Community of West
African States) sanctions that have been put in place. And then to
support that effort we have leveraged our own assistance and
investments, which we’ve announced very clearly, if the country and the
leadership there turns back to a democratic path, we’re willing to
explore progressively lifting that freeze in assistance and potential
investments,” Pratt said, adding that the U.S. also uses “a combination
of sanctions plus leveraging our engagement and assistance.”</p>
<p>Devermont agreed saying that trade investment has been an important
part of the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit.</p>
<p>“One of the most important initiatives that has come out of the
continent in the last couple years has been the Africa free –
Continental Free Trade Area. And we signed an MOU with the AfCFTA at
this summit because the goals of the AfCFTA to unite 1.3 billion people
in a single market and to trade a nominal GDP that’s larger than India’s
is a huge boon.  And in that process, harmonizing regulations, reducing
trade and non-trade barriers, that will benefit all countries whether
they are experiencing a crisis or not.”</p>
<p>Devermont said the U.S. is also looking at the underlying drivers of
conflict, and is investing in new approaches, including elevating its
focus on elections and anti-corruption measures.</p>

id="conservationists-us-tribes-say-salmon-deal-is-map-to-breaching-dams">Conservationists,
US Tribes Say Salmon Deal Is Map to Breaching Dams</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>seattle — The U.S. government said Thursday it plans to spend more
than $1 billion over the next decade to help recover depleted
populations of salmon in the Pacific Northwest, and that it will help
figure out how to offset the hydropower, transportation and other
benefits provided by four controversial dams on the Snake River, should
Congress ever agree to breach them.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden’s administration stopped short of calling for the
removal of the dams to save the fish, but Northwest tribes and
conservationists who have long sought that called the agreement a road
map for dismantling them. Filed in U.S. District Court in Oregon, it
pauses long-running litigation over federal operation of the dams and
represents the most significant step yet toward breaching them.</p>
<p>“Today’s historic agreement marks a new direction for the Pacific
Northwest,” senior White House adviser John Podesta said in a written
statement. “Today, the Biden-Harris administration and state and tribal
governments are agreeing to work together to protect salmon and other
native fish, honor our obligations to tribal nations, and recognize the
important services the Columbia River system provides to the economy of
the Pacific Northwest.”</p>
<p>The Columbia River Basin, an area roughly the size of Texas, was once
the world’s greatest salmon-producing river system, with at least 16
stocks of salmon and steelhead.</p>
<p>Today, four are extinct and seven are listed under the Endangered
Species Act. Another iconic but endangered Northwest species, a
population of killer whales, also depends on the salmon.</p>
<p>Dams blamed for decline</p>
<p>Dams are a main culprit behind the salmon’s decline, and federal
fisheries scientists have concluded that breaching the dams in eastern
Washington on the Snake River, the largest tributary of the Columbia,
would be the best hope for recovering them, providing the fish with
access to hundreds of miles of pristine habitat and spawning grounds in
Idaho.</p>
<p>Conservation groups sued the federal government more than two decades
ago in an effort to save the fish. They have argued that the continued
operation of the dams violates the Endangered Species Act as well as
treaties dating to the mid-19th century ensuring the tribes’ right to
harvest fish.</p>
<p>Republicans in Congress who oppose the breaching of the dams released
a leaked copy of the draft agreement late last month.</p>
<p>“I have serious concerns about what this agreement means for the
future of our region,” Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a
Republican from Washington, said in an emailed statement Thursday. “It
jeopardizes the energy, irrigation and navigation benefits that support
our entire way of life, and it makes commitments on behalf of Congress
without engaging us.”</p>
<p>Details of agreement</p>
<p>Under the agreement, the U.S. government will build enough new clean
energy projects in the Pacific Northwest to replace the hydropower
generated by the dams — the Ice Harbor, Little Goose, Lower Monumental
and Lower Granite.</p>
<p>The agreement includes a compromise regarding dam operations —
providing for additional water to be spilled in the spring, fall and
winter to help some salmon runs such as spring and summer Chinook, while
reducing the spill required in late summer, when energy demand is high
and production is especially profitable. That could harm fall Chinook,
said the environmental law firm Earthjustice, which is representing
environmental, fishing and renewable energy groups in the
litigation.</p>
<p>The federal Bonneville Power Administration, which operates the dams,
will spend $300 million over 10 years to restore native fish and their
habitats throughout the Columbia River Basin, though it said the
agreement would result in rate increases of only 0.7%. Two-thirds of
that money will go toward hatchery improvements and operations, and the
rest will go to what the agreement refers to as the “six sovereigns” —
Oregon, Washington and the four tribes involved: the Yakama Nation, the
Nez Perce Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian
Reservation and the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs.</p>
<p>Combined with other fish-restoration funding, the federal government
will be spending more than $1 billion over the next decade, the White
House said.</p>
<p>The U.S. also will conduct or pay for studies of how the
transportation, irrigation and recreation provided by the dams could be
replaced. The dams made the town of Lewiston, Idaho, the most inland
seaport on the West Coast, and many farmers in the region rely on barges
to ship their crops, though rail is also available.</p>
<p>The agreement “lays out a pathway to breaching,” said Shannon
Wheeler, chairman of the Nez Perce Tribe. “When these things are
replaced, and the Pacific Northwest is transforming into a stronger,
more resilient, better place, then there’s a responsibility … to make
the decisions that are necessary to make sure these treaty promises are
kept.”</p>
<p>Utility and business groups Northwest RiverPartners, the Public Power
Council and the Pacific Northwest Waterways Association have opposed the
agreement.</p>
<p>“This settlement undermines the future of achieving clean energy
goals and will raise the rates of electricity customers across the
region while exacerbating the greatest threat to salmon that NOAA
scientists have identified — the warming, acidifying ocean,” Northwest
RiverPartners said in a news release Thursday.</p>
<p>There has been growing recognition that the harm some dams cause to
fish outweighs their usefulness, but only a few lawmakers in the region
have embraced the idea. Dams on the Elwha River in Washington state and
the Klamath River along the Oregon-California border have been or are
being removed.</p>
<p>In 2021, Republican Representative Mike Simpson of Idaho proposed
removing the earthen berms on either side of the four Lower Snake River
dams to let the river flow freely, and to spend $33 billion to replace
the benefits of the dams.</p>
<p>Last year, Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Washington U.S. Senator
Patty Murray, both Democrats, released a report saying carbon-free
electricity produced by the dams must be replaced before they are
breached. Inslee declined to endorse breaching the dams during a
conference call with reporters on Thursday, but he said figuring out how
to replace their benefits would enable Congress to make a better
decision.</p>
<p>“I don’t think this agreement makes anything inevitable, but it does
make it much more likely that we’ll have the information we need to make
the decision,” he said.</p>
<p>In October, Biden directed federal agencies to use all available
resources to restore abundant salmon runs in the Columbia River Basin,
but that memo too stopped short of calling for the removal of the
dams.</p>
<p>“The energy needs of the Pacific Northwest should not rest on the
backs of salmon,” said Donella Miller, fisheries science manager with
the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission. “What’s good for the
salmon is good for the environment, and what’s good for the environment
is good for the people.”</p>

id="missile-fired-from-rebel-controlled-yemen-misses-container-ship">Missile
Fired from Rebel-Controlled Yemen Misses Container Ship</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — A missile fired from territory
controlled by Yemen’s Houthi rebels missed a container ship traveling
through the crucial Bab el-Mandeb Strait on Thursday, a U.S. defense
official said, the latest attack threatening shipping in the crucial
maritime chokepoint.</p>
<p>The seaborne assaults attributed to the Iran-backed Houthis have been
part of their pressure campaign over the Israel-Hamas war raging in the
Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>The Houthis have attacked vessels in the Red Sea and launched drones
and missiles targeting Israel. In recent days, they have threatened to
attack any vessel they believe is either going to or coming from Israel,
though several vessels targeted had no apparent link at all.</p>
<p>The missile fired Thursday splashed harmlessly in the water near the
Maersk Gibraltar, a Hong Kong-flagged container ship that had been
traveling from Salalah, Oman, to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the U.S. official
said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss
intelligence matters.</p>
<p>The official’s comments came after the British military’s United
Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, which monitors Mideast shipping
lanes, put out an alert warning of an incident in the strait, which
separates East Africa from the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>Later Thursday, a Houthi spokesperson claimed the rebels had hit the
Maersk Gibraltar with a drone strike, after its crew allegedly failed to
respond to the rebels’ call to surrender. The spokesperson for the
Iran-backed fighters, Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, also claimed the vessel
was heading to Israel.</p>
<p>Saree did not provide any details about the purported strike to the
ship or any damage inflicted.</p>
<p>Maersk, one of the world’s biggest shippers, did not immediately
respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the private intelligence firm Ambrey said the
ship had also been called over the radio by “an entity claiming to be
the ‘Yemeni Navy’ ahead of the missile being launched towards the
vessel.”</p>
<p>“The ‘Yemeni Navy’ demanded the vessel alter course to head for
Yemen,” Ambrey said and assessed the entity to be the Houthis.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, two missiles fired from Houthi-held territory missed a
commercial tanker loaded with Indian-manufactured jet fuel near the key
Bab el-Mandeb Strait. Also near the strait, a missile fired by Houthis
on Monday night slammed into a Norwegian-flagged tanker in the Red
Sea.</p>
<p>Global shipping has increasingly been targeted as the Israel-Hamas
war threatens to become a wider regional conflict — even during a brief
pause in fighting during which Hamas exchanged hostages for Palestinian
prisoners held by Israel. The collapse of the truce and the resumption
of a punishing Israeli ground offensive and airstrikes on Gaza have
raised the risk of more sea attacks.</p>
<p>The Bab el-Mandeb Strait is only 29 kilometers wide at its narrowest
point, limiting traffic to two channels for inbound and outbound
shipments, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Nearly 10% of all oil traded at sea passes through it. An estimated $1
trillion in goods pass through the strait annually.</p>
<p>In November, Houthis seized a vehicle transport ship linked to Israel
in the Red Sea off Yemen. The rebels still hold the vessel near the port
city of Hodeida. Separately, a container ship owned by an Israeli
billionaire came under attack by a suspected Iranian drone in the Indian
Ocean.</p>
<p>A separate, tentative cease-fire between the Houthis and a Saudi-led
coalition fighting on behalf of Yemen’s exiled government has held for
months despite that country’s long war. That’s raised concerns that any
wider conflict in the sea — or a potential reprisal strike from Western
forces — could reignite those tensions in the Arab world’s poorest
nation.</p>

id="jurors-deciding-giulianis-penalty-in-georgia-election-workers-case">Jurors
Deciding Giuliani’s Penalty in Georgia Election Workers’ Case</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Jurors began deliberating Thursday to decide how much
Rudy Giuliani must pay two former Georgia election workers for spreading
lies about them that led to a barrage of racist threats and upended
their lives.</p>
<p>The jury left for the day without announcing a decision and were
expected to resume deliberations at Washington’s federal courthouse
Friday morning.</p>
<p>Wandrea “Shaye” Moss and her mother, Ruby Freeman, are seeking tens
of millions of dollars in damages over Giuliani’s false claims accusing
them of ballot fraud while the former New York City mayor was fighting
to keep Republican Donald Trump in the White House after the November
2020 election won by Democrat Joe Biden.</p>
<p>The potential hefty damages come at the same time Giuliani is gearing
up to defend himself against criminal charges stemming from his legal
representation of Trump. Giuliani’s lawyer told jurors the damages the
women are seeking “would be the end of Mr. Giuliani.”</p>
<p>In his closing argument, an attorney for Moss and Freeman highlighted
how Giuliani has not stopped repeating the false conspiracy theory
asserting the workers meddled in the 2020 presidential election.
Attorney Michael Gottlieb played a video of Giuliani outside the
courthouse earlier this week repeating the false claims about his
clients. Giuliani had previously conceded in court documents that he
made public comments falsely accusing the women of ballot fraud.</p>
<p>“Mr. Giuliani has shown over and over again he will not take our
client’s names out of his mouth,” Gottlieb said. “Facts will not stop
him. He says he isn’t sorry, and he’s telegraphing he will do this
again. Believe him.”</p>
<p>Giuliani’s attorney acknowledged that his client was wrong but
insisted that he was not fully responsible for the vitriol the women
faced. He sought to largely pin the blame on a right-wing website that
published the surveillance video of the women counting ballots.</p>
<p>Gottlieb described Freeman and Moss as “heroes,” adding that “after
everything they went through, they stood up and said, ‘no more.’” He
also read from a chapter in Giuliani’s book on leadership where the
former mayor said his father told him never to be a bully. The lawyer
said: “If only Mr. Giuliani had listened.”</p>
<p>“The lies in this case became a sustained, deliberate, viral
campaign, the purpose of which was to overturn an election and have
these statements rocket around the world millions and millions of
times,” Gottlieb said.</p>
<p>The women’s lawyers are asking for at least $24 million for each
woman in defamation damages alone. They’re also seeking compensation for
their emotional harm and punitive damages. Gottlieb asked the jury to
send a message to other powerful people with the amount they award.</p>
<p>“Facts matter. Truth is truth, and you will be held accountable,” he
said.</p>
<p>Giuliani’s lawyer has said any award should be much less, describing
the damages the women are seeking as the “civil equivalent of the death
penalty.” Attorney Joseph Sibley told jurors they should compensate the
women for what they are owed but urged them to “remember this is a great
man.”</p>
<p>“I want you to send a message to America, we can come together in
compassion and sympathy,” he said.</p>
<p>His lawyer has argued there is no evidence Giuliani himself
encouraged the harassment. Sibley told jurors that right-wing website
Gateway Pundit was “patient zero” in spreading the conspiracy theory
about the women and said Giuliani was sued because he is “patient deep
pockets.”</p>
<p>“Just because these things happened — and they did happen — doesn’t
make my client responsible for them,” Sibley said.</p>
<p>Giuliani’s defense rested Thursday morning without calling a single
witness after the former mayor reversed course and decided not to take
the stand. Giuliani’s lawyer had told jurors in his opening statement
that they would hear from his client but after his comments outside
court, the judge barred him from claiming in testimony that his
conspiracy theories were right.</p>
<p>Giuliani’s lawyer said his client was not testifying because Freeman
and Moss had “been through enough.” His testimony also could have been
used against him in the criminal case in Georgia.</p>
<p>On the witness stand, Moss and Freeman recounted receiving a torrent
of hateful and threatening messages after they became the targets of the
conspiracy theory pushed by Giuliani and other Trump allies. The women
told jurors the lies made them fear for their lives and described how
they remain scared to go out in public years later.</p>
<p>Despite already being held liable in the case, Giuliani repeated his
false claims about the women earlier this week. On Monday, he told
reporters outside the courthouse that everything he said about the women
was “true,” again accusing them of “engaging in changing votes.”</p>
<p>The case is among mounting legal and financial woes for the man once
celebrated as “America’s mayor” for his leadership after the September
11, 2001, terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>Giuliani is among 19 people charged in Georgia in the case accusing
Trump and his allies of working to subvert the state’s 2020 election
results. Giuliani has pleaded not guilty and characterized the case as
politically motivated.</p>

Launch of New Vulcan Centaur Rocket Delayed Until January</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The maiden liftoff of a new American rocket called
Vulcan Centaur has been delayed from December 24 to January 8, the
company that developed it said Thursday.</p>
<p>The postponement stems from last-minute technical snags, but United
Launch Alliance CEO Tory Bruno said on X, formerly Twitter, that a
recent dress rehearsal on the launch pad went well.</p>
<p>The rocket will carry a private lunar lander, developed by the
startup Astrobotic, which could become the first such private craft to
touch down on the moon and the first American robot to land on the
surface since the Apollo program ended in 1972.</p>
<p>“This is sort of, in a way, the first giant step in the campaign for
the U.S., and for all of our friends, to go back to the moon, eventually
with people,” Bruno told AFP in an interview last week.</p>
<p>“It’s a pretty big deal to have a payload at all, let alone one that
goes to the surface of the moon,” he added.</p>
<p>“We wanted to do something really important, and we have a lot of
confidence, obviously, in the design of our rocket,” Bruno said.</p>
<p>Liftoff for this mission called Cert-1 will take place at the U.S.
Space Force launch base at Cape Canaveral, Florida.</p>
<p>In dress rehearsals in recent days, some “routine” issues emerged in
the ground system so a Christmas Eve flight is now out, and the new
window opens January 8, Bruno wrote on X.</p>
<p>Besides the lunar lander, this rocket will carry the cremated remains
of several people associated with the original “Star Trek” series,
including creator Gene Roddenberry and cast member Nichelle Nichols, who
played the character Uhura. Roddenberry’s ashes have been launched into
orbit previously.</p>
<p>A sample of Bruno’s own DNA will also be taken into space. “Who
wouldn’t want to go to space with five ‘Star Trek’ people?” he mused in
the interview with AFP.</p>
<p>Vulcan Centaur is meant to replace ULA’s Atlas V and Delta IV rockets
and is designed to carry a payload of up to 27.2 metric tons into low
orbit, comparable to what the SpaceX Falcon 9 can do.</p>

replaced it with my

I addressed the How Do I Write question, now let me address Why I Write.
I write at least partially because I know there are good people who love
my writing. Anyway, I love to write because there are people who love to
read. And I feel connected to them. My mother was the prototype. We
weren’t very close in actual life, but she was a devoted reader of my
blog. It gave us a connection. And I assume all daily or nightly readers
of this blog have that kind of connection, whether I hear from them or
not. And sometimes you do
<a href="https://twitter.com/tanyaweiman/status/1735267625691701440">hear

<h2 id="the-worlds-most-vulnerable-nations-got-shut-out-at-cop28">The
World’s Most Vulnerable Nations Got Shut Out at COP28</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-14, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDgxMTc0Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxODkwOTEyMn0.vqR_kphls7JIMnSEg_H22NuPh1emMda-n5ZgDteZeKU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
In the moments after Sultan Al Jaber, the president of this year’s COP,
struck his gavel to finalize the text of the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/cop28-agreement-5-things" target="_blank">first-ever
global stocktake</a>, Anne Rasmussen, the lead negotiator for the
Alliance of Small Island States, took the floor.
</p>
<p>
“We are a little confused about what just happened,”
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2023/dec/13/litany-of-loopholes-samoa-delegate-challenges-cop28-president-on-climate-pact-video" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rasmussen
said</a>. “It seems that you gaveled the decisions, and the small island
developing states were not in the room.”
</p>
<p>
Rasmussen and her colleagues, it turned out, had left the room to
discuss the changes they wanted to see in the text, with the idea that
they could come back and present those changes to Al Jaber. But, as Tom
Evans of E3G explained to me recently,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop28-global-stocktake-negotiations" target="_self">COP
works on the idea of consensus</a>, which is reached when all the
members who are in the room when a vote is called find common agreement.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, consensus is used in odd political ways — the U.S. delegation
for example, left the room during discussions around a loss and damage
fund, which allowed the vote to go forward despite the U.S.’s
hesitations. This may be what everyone thought the members of AOSIS were
doing; when they re-entered the room, they received a standing ovation,
which contributed to Rasmussen’s confusion.
</p>
<p>
But the moment had passed; there was nothing Rasmussen or her colleagues
could do to get the text of the stocktake amended. So she used her time
on the floor to stake her moral authority. I’m quoting liberally,
because I think her words are worth taking in:
</p>
<p>
“AOSIS at the beginning of this COP had one objective, to ensure that
1.5 [degrees Celsius] is safeguarded in a meaningful way. Our leaders
and ministers have been clear. We cannot afford to return to our islands
with the message that this process has failed us,” she
<a href="https://www.aosis.org/cop28-closing-plenary-aosis-statement-on-gst-decision/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.
“We have come to the conclusion that the course correction that is
needed has not yet been secured.”
</p>
<p>
Rasmussen continued, pointing out paragraphs and sub-paragraphs where
the text failed to live up to its promise. It was, in short, a rebuke of
what was supposed to be the most important statement to come out of this
conference, the failed realization of a promise that was made when the
Paris Agreement was written in 2015.
</p>
<p>
In many ways, that promise is personal for Rasmussen and her colleagues.
AOSIS is the reason the 1.5 degree C target is in the Paris Agreement in
the first place — as Justin Worland
<a href="https://time.com/4141821/cop-21-ambition-target-obama/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>
in TIME in 2015, President Obama said the voices of the island nations
were vital in those talks — and the passage of the stocktake without the
presence of those nations is a cynical reversal of how things happened
at that historic conference.
</p>
<p>
Rasmussen received a standing ovation when she finished.

How the NYPD defeated bodycams (14 Dec 2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-14, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links How the NYPD defeated bodycams: NYPD leadership were
accountability’s adversaries, not its partners. Hey look at this:
Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2003, 2008, 2013, 2018, 2022
Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current
writing projects, current reading How the NYPD defeated bodycams
(permalink) Anything that can’t go on forever will eventually stop. When
American patience for racial profiling in traffic stops reached a
breaking point, cops rolled out dashcams. Dashcam footage went AWOL, or
just recorded lots of racist, pretextual stops. Racial profiling
continued. Tasers and pepper spray were supposed to curb the undue use
of force by giving cops an alternative to shooting dangerous-seeming
people. Instead, we got cops who tasered and sprayed unarmed people and
then shot them to pieces. Next came bodycams: by indelibly recording
cops’ interactions with the public, body-worn cameras were pitched as a
way to bring accountability to American law-enforcement. Finally, police
leadership would be able to sort officers’ claims from eyewitness
accounts and figure out who was lying. Bad cops could be disciplined.
Repeat offenders could be fired. Police boosters insist that police
violence and corruption are the result of “a few bad apples.” As the
saying goes, “a few bad apples spoil the bushel.” If you think there are
just a few bad cops on the force, then you should want to get rid of
them before they wreck the whole institution. Bodycams could empirically
identify the bad apples, right? Well, hypothetically. But what if police
leadership don’t want to get rid of the bad apples? What if the reason
that dashcams, tasers, and pepper spray failed is that police leadership
are fine with them? If that were the case, then bodycams would turn into
just another expensive prop for an off-Broadway accountability theater.
What if? In “How Police Have Undermined the Promise of Body Cameras,”
Propublica’s Eric Umansky and Umar Farooq deliver a characteristically
thorough, deep, and fascinating account of the failure of NYPD bodycams
to create the accountability that New York’s political and police
leadership promised:
https://www.propublica.org/article/how-police-undermined-promise-body-cameras
Topline: NYPD’s bodycam rollout was sabotaged by police leadership and
top NYC politicians. Rather than turning over bodycam footage to
oversight boards following violent incidents, the NYPD suppresses it.
When overseers are allowed to see the footage, they get fragmentary
access. When those fragments reveal misconduct, they are forbidden to
speak of it. When the revealed misconduct is separate from the main
incident, it can’t be used to discipline officers. When footage is made
available to the public, it is selectively edited to omit evidence of
misconduct. NYPD policy contains loopholes that allow them to withhold
footage. Where those loopholes don’t apply, the NYPD routinely
suppresses footage anyway, violating its own policies. When the NYPD
violates its policies, it faces no consequences. When overseers
complain, they are fired. Bodycams could be a source of accountability
for cops, but for that to be true, control over bodycams would have to
vest with institutions that want to improve policing. If control over
bodycams is given to institutions that want to shield cops from
accountability, that’s exactly what will happen. There is nothing about
bodycams that makes them more resistant to capture than dashcams, tasers
or pepper spray. This is a problem across multiple police departments.
Minneapolis, for example, has policies from before and after the George
Floyd uprisings that require bodycam disclosure, and those policies are
routinely flouted. Derek Chauvin, George Floyd’s murderer, was a repeat
offender and had been caught on bodycam kneeling on other Black peoples’
necks. Chauvin once clubbed a 14 year old child into unconsciousness and
then knelt on his neck for 15 minutes as his mother begged for her
child’s life. Chauvin faced no discipline for this and the footage was
suppressed. In Montgomery, Alabama, it took five years of hard wrangling
to get access to bodycam footage after an officer sicced his attack dog
on an unarmed Black man without warning. The dog severed the man’s
femoral artery and he died. Montgomery PD suppressed the footage, citing
the risk of officers facing “embarrassment.” In Memphis, the notoriously
racist police department was able to suppress bodycam disclosures until
the murder of Tyre Nichols. The behavior of the officers who beat
Nichols to death are a testament to their belief in their own impunity.
Some officers illegally switched off their cameras; others participated
in the beating in full view of the cameras, fearing no consequences. In
South Carolina, the police murder of Walter Scott was captured on a
bystander’s phone camera. That footage made it clear that Scott’s
uniformed killers lied, prompting then-governor Nikki Haley to sign a
law giving the public access to bodycam footage. But the law contained a
glaring loophole: it made bodycam footage “not a public record subject
to disclosure.” Nothing changed. Bodycam footage does often reveal that
killer cops lie about their actions. When a Cincinnati cop killed a
Black man during a 2015 traffic-stop, his bodycam footage revealed that
the officer lied about his victim “lunging at him” before he shot. Last
summer, a Philadelphia cop was caught lying about the circumstances that
led to him murdering a member of the public. Again, the officer claimed
the man had “lunged at him.” The cop’s camera showed the man sitting
peacefully in his own car. Police departments across the country
struggle with violent, lying officers, but few can rival the NYPD for
corruption, violence, scale and impunity. The NYPD has its own “goon
squad,” the Strategic Response Group, whose leaked manual reveals how
the secret unit spends about $100m/year training and deploying
ultraviolent, illegal tactics:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/07/cruelty-by-design/#blam-blam-blam The
NYPD’s disciplinary records – published despite a panicked scramble to
suppress them – reveal the NYPD’s infestation with criminal cops who
repeatedly break the law in meting out violence against the public:
https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/27/ip/#nypd-who These cops are the
proverbial bad apples, and they do indeed spoil the barrel. A 2019
empirical analysis of police disciplinary records show that corruption
is contagious: when crooked cops are paired with partners who have clean
disciplinary records, those partners become crooked, too, and the effect
lasts even after the partnership ends:
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2378023119879798 Despite
the risk of harboring criminals in police ranks, the NYPD goes to
extreme lengths to keep its worst officers on the street. New York
City’s police “union”‘s deal with the city requires NYC to divert
millions to a (once) secret slushfund used to pay high-priced lawyers to
defend cops whose conduct is so egregious that the city’s own attorneys
refuse to defend them:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/03/26/overfitness-factor/#heads-you-lose-tails-they-win
This is a good place for your periodic reminder that police unions are
not unions:
https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/28/afterland/#selective-solidarity
Indeed, despite rhetoric to the contrary, policing is a relatively safe
occupation, with death rates well below the risks to roofers, loggers,
or pizza delivery drivers:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/01/27/extraordinary-popular-delusions/#onshore-havana-syndrome
The biggest risk to police officers – the single factor that
significantly increased death rates among cops – is police unions
themselves. Police unions successfully pressured cities across American
to reject covid risk mitigation, from masking to vaccinations, leading
to a wave of police deaths. “Suicide by cop” is very rare, but US
officers committed “mass suicide by cop union”:
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/12/us/police-covid-vaccines.html But the
story that policing is much more dangerous than it really is a useful
one. It has a business-model. Military contractors who turn local Barney
Fifes into Judge Dredd cosplayers with assault rifles, tanks and other
“excess” military gear make billions from the tale:
https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/10/flintstone-delano-roosevelt/#1033-1022
It’s not just beltway bandits who love this story. For cops to be
shielded from consequences for murdering the public, they need to tell
themselves and the rest of us that they are a “thin blue line,” and not
mere armed bureaucrats. The myth that cops are in constant danger from
the public justifies hair-trigger killings. Consider the use of
“civilian” to describe the public. Police are civilians. The only kind
of police officer who isn’t a civilian is a military policeman. Places
where “civilians” interact with non-civilian law enforcement are, by
definition, under military occupation. Calling the public “civilians” is
a cheap rhetorical trick that converts a police officer to a patrolling
soldier in hostile territory. Calling us “civilians” justifies killing
us, because if we’re civilians, then they are soldiers and we are at
war. The NYPD clearly conceives of itself as an occupying force and
considers its “civilian” oversight to be the enemy. When New York’s
Civilian Complaint Review Board gained independence in 1993, thousands
of off-duty cops joined Rudy Giuliani in a mass protest at City Hall and
an occupation of the Brooklyn Bridge. This mass freakout is a measure of
police intolerance for oversight – after all, the CCRB isn’t even
allowed to discipline officers, only make (routinely ignored)
recommendations. Kerry Sweet was the NYPD lawyer who oversaw the
department’s bodycam rollout. He once joked that the NYPD missed a
chance to “bomb the room” where the NYPD’s CCRB was meeting (when
Propublica asked him to confirm this, he said he couldn’t remember those
remarks, but “on reflection, it should have been an airstrike”). Obvious
defects in the NYPD’s bodycam policy go beyond the ability to suppress
disclosure of the footage. The department has no official tracking
system for its bodycam files. They aren’t geotagged, only marked by
officer badge-number and name. So if a member of the public comes
forward to complain that an unknown officer committed a crime at a
specific place and time, there’s no way to retrieve that footage. Even
where footage can be found, the NYPD often hides the ball: in 20% of
cases where the Department told the CCRB footage didn’t exist, they were
lying. Figuring out how to make bodycam footage work better is complex,
but there are some obvious first steps. Other cities have no problem
geotagging their footage. In Chicago, the CCRB can directly access the
servers where bodycam footage is stored (when the NYPD CCRB members
proposed this, they were fired). Meanwhile, the NYPD keeps protecting
its killers. The Propublica story opens with the police killing of
Miguel Richards. Richards’ parents hadn’t heard from him in a while, so
they asked his Bronx landlord to check on him (the Richards live in
Jamaica). The landlord called the cops. The cops killed Richards. The
cops claimed he had a gun and they were acting in self-defense. They
released a highly edited reel of bodycam footage to support that claim.
When the full video was eventually extracted, it revealed that Richards
had a tiny plastic toy guy and a small folding knife. The officers
involved believed he was suffering an acute mental health incident and
stated that policy demanded that they close his bedroom door and wait
for specialists. Instead, they barked orders at him and then fired 16
rounds at him. Seven hit him. One ruptured his aorta. As he lay dying on
his bedroom floor, one officer roughly tossed him around and cuffed him.
He died. New York’s Police Benevolent Association – the largest police
“union” in NYC – awarded the officers involved its “Finest of the
Finest” prize for their conduct in the killing. This isn’t an isolated
incident. A month after the NYPD decided not to punish the cops who
killed Richards, NYPD officers murdered Kawaski Trawick in his Bronx
apartment:
https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/04/kawaski-trawick/#Kawaski-Trawick The
officers lied about it, suppressed release of the bodycam footage that
would reveal their lies, and then escaped any justice when the footage
and the lies were revealed. None of this means that bodycams are
useless. It just means that bodycams will only help bring accountability
to police forces when they are directed by parties who have the will and
power to make the police accountable. When police leaders and city
governments support police corruption, adding bodycams won’t change that
fact. (Image: Cryteria, CC BY 3.0; Tony Webster, CC BY-SA 2.0; modified)

<p>date: 2023-12-14, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
When the announcement came that COP29 will be held in Baku in 2024, the
immediate reaction in the climate community was “<em>again?!</em>”
</p>
<p>
It wasn’t that Azerbaijan — a nation of about 10 million people,
situated on the Caspian Sea at the southern tail of the Caucasus
mountains — had hosted the global climate summit before. Actually, it
almost didn’t get the 2024 hosting gig at all: COP29 was briefly
homeless after Russia vowed to block Bulgaria’s bid (because Bulgaria is
part of the European Union) and longtime enemies Azerbaijan and Armenia
vowed to block each other’s bids (because of what many have
characterized as
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/nagorno-karabakh-armenia-azerbaijan-russia-ukraine-war-putin-rcna117794" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an
ethnic cleansing</a>). Other nations in the region balked at the sheer
size of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop28-cop29-uae-azerbaijan-armenia" target="_blank">what
the COP event has become</a>. At one point, even Australia and Bonn,
Germany, were on the table as potential COP29 replacements if the
Eastern European bloc couldn’t pull things together.
</p>
<p>
But, rather amazingly, it did. That means — as countless headlines have
blared, and as you’re undoubtedly already aware — that the United
Nations summit intended to assess and progress the goal of limiting
climate change will be held in an oil and gas-producing state
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/09/climate/cop29-azerbaijan-climate.html" target="_blank">for
the third consecutive year</a>. Cue the
groans.<em><del><strong></strong></del></em>
</p>
<p>
That is reason enough for hand-wringing, especially after a
<a href="https://heated.world/p/its-official-cop28-has-more-fossil" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">record
turn-out of fossil fuel lobbyists</a> at the convention this year, not
to mention the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/am-briefing-al-jaber-plays-defense" target="_self">scandal</a>
over the head of ADNOC leading the whole shebang. But
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/cop28-dubai-sultan-al-jaber-controversy" target="_self">if
you thought all <em>that</em> was absurd and disturbing</a>, wait until
you hear about Azerbaijan.
</p>
<p>
“It’s stunning to me that they would make Baku the next place for COP,”
Ronald Suny, a distinguished professor emeritus of History at the
University of Michigan and an expert on the South Caucasian nations
<a href="https://bookshop.org/contributors/ronald-grigor-suny-7b3fd1cc-37e5-4977-9617-4624373f893b" target="_blank">who’s
written extensively about Azerbaijan</a>, told me.
</p>
<p>
Yes, Azerbaijan is a petrostate. But more alarmingly, it is also even
<a href="https://freedomhouse.org/countries/freedom-world/scores" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more
repressive</a> and authoritarian than the United Arab Emirates based on
the scale developed by Freedom House, a human rights watchdog group.
“Azerbaijan is not even a one-party state,” Suny explained. “It’s a
one-person or one-family state.”
</p>
<p>
To make a long and complicated history very short, former First
Secretary of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan Heydar Aliyev came to
power after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1993 and eventually
passed his title of head of state onto his only<strong> </strong>son,
Ilham Aliyev, in
“<a href="https://www.hrw.org/legacy/backgrounder/eca/azerbaijan/azerbaijan-elections2003.pdf" target="_blank">irregular</a>”
elections in 2003. Ilham Aliyev is still president today, and will
remain so indefinitely. “There’s no dissent allowed,” Suny said.
“There’s absolute control of the media — much stricter than Russia.
Anyone who criticizes [the government] is either in jail or in exile.
And lots of people are in jail.”
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, having COP29 in Baku could be viewed as a small
positive. “For years, climate change has been a factor…in wars and
conflicts,” reads one effusive lead paragraph
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-talks-cop29-baku-azerbaijan-be1f2a549ca7790f57c2157c92d92aeb" target="_blank">in
<em>The Associated Press</em></a>. “Now for the first time, it’s part of
a peace deal.” True, the attention from the UN helped to spur a prisoner
exchange and peace talks between Azerbaijan and Armenia following
renewed bloodshed over
<a href="https://jacobin.com/2023/01/armenia-azerbaijan-conflict-nagorno-karabakh-post-soviet-politics-history" target="_blank">the
contested Nagorno-Karabakh region</a> earlier this fall. It’s also
likely that Azerbaijan will be on its best behavior ahead of the UN
convention, given that it’s now under a higher-than-usual level of
international scrutiny. Giving Baku the convention “is not necessarily a
bad thing,”
<a href="https://www.rashmee.com/is-azerbaijan-a-cop-out-for-the-parties-on-climate-change/" target="_blank">argues</a>
Rashmee Roshan Lall, an international affairs columnist, on her blog,
“because it shows that COPs reflect the diversity of the world in which
we live and seek to preserve.”
</p>
<p>
But allowing COP29 to happen inAzerbaijan also helps to legitimize and
sanitize Ilham Aliyev’s rule<strong>. </strong>This is why other
authoritarian regimes from Russia to Saudi Arabia to Qatar and Dubai
have vied to host global events such as the soccer World Cup and the
Olympics. Since 2012, Baku has played host to the Eurovision Song
Contest, the First European Games, and the Formula 1 Grand Prix,
according to Gubad Ibadoghlu, a senior policy analyst at Azerbaijan’s
Economic Research Center,
<a href="https://crudeaccountability.org/corrupt-and-flashy-events-disguised-as-modernization-in-azerbaijan/" target="_blank">writing
for the website
</a><em><a href="https://crudeaccountability.org/corrupt-and-flashy-events-disguised-as-modernization-in-azerbaijan/">Crude
Accountability</a></em>. The government in Baku explicitly “tries to
whitewash its damaged image in the international arena by ‘paying
attention to modernization’ and by creating connections with global
leaders in the sphere of sports and culture,” Ibadoghlu said.
</p>
<p>
Suny sees the same thing happening now with COP. “It could be that
Azerbaijan, which has tried and worked very hard to refurbish and
beautify its image, will benefit from such an event and will be happy to
put on a good face,” he said. And as Ibadoghlu pointed out, Azerbaijan
has spent a huge amount of money on this program over the years. “It’s a
very rich state and it can divert its resources — because it certainly
doesn’t go into the people — to building extraordinary buildings,” Suny
added. By allowing COP to be held in a country that
<a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2023/country-chapters/azerbaijan#:~:text=Azerbaijan's%20human%20rights%20record%20did,critics%20and%20other%20dissenting%20voices." target="_blank">viciously
cracks down on dissent and free speech</a>, then, the UN is not only
turning a blind eye to but actively assisting what is basically
<a href="https://www.accessnow.org/press-release/cop28-uae-greenwashing/" target="_blank">a
twisted form of greenwashing</a>.
</p>
<p>
Curiously, estimates indicate that Azerbaijan might not be an oil state
for much longer. The nation is expected to deplete its supply and sole
source of wealth within the next 25 years — an involuntary
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/cop28-agreement-fossil-fuel-phaseout" target="_self">phase-out
by 2050</a>, if you will. According to
<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2023/11/24/investments-and-policy-reforms-towards-low-carbon-transition-and-resilience-are-in-azerbaijan-s-economic-interest-says-w" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
World Bank report</a> published two weeks ago, “urgent action on
climate” — including investing in renewable energy, prioritizing energy
efficiency, and climate-proofing its agricultural sector — “can help
Azerbaijan minimize the risks emerging from the global low-carbon
transition and protect the living standards of its people.”
</p>
<p>
In that sense, at the least, Baku <em>needs</em> COP. Now we have to
wait to see what it does with its chance.

<p>date: 2023-12-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. lawmakers passed the massive annual defense
spending bill Thursday, approving the $886 billion National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA) by a vote of 310-118 to be signed into law by
President Joe Biden. The bill setting policy and spending priorities for
the Department of Defense for 2024 is $28 billion larger than last
year’s spending bill, an increase of around three percent.</p>
<p>“The NDAA is one of the most consequential bills Congress considers,”
said Rep. Mike Rogers, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
“Passage of this bill each year sends an important signal to the men and
women defending our freedom that Congress can function and will
prioritize their needs. Above all else, enacting the NDAA has never been
more vital than today. America and our allies face unprecedented and
rapidly evolving threats from China, Russia, Iran, North Korea and
terrorist organizations throughout the world.”  </p>
<p>The bill authorizes a 5.2 percent pay raise for US service members,
extends the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative through 2027 and
provides funding for security cooperation among the US, United Kingdom
and Australia. </p>
<p>The U.S. Senate passed the NDAA late Wednesday by a vote of 87-13.
 </p>
<p>“We’ll strengthen our resources in the Indo-Pacific, to deter
aggression by the Chinese government, and give resources for the
military in Taiwan. We’ll give DOD more resources to deploy and develop
AI, protect against foreign cyber threats, increase the transparency of
Unidentified Areal Phenomena,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said
on the Senate floor Wednesday night after passage. </p>
<p>Earlier Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also
praised the NDAA on the Senate floor, saying the legislation,
“recognizes the need to strengthen America’s position in strategic
competition with China through targeted improvements to critical
capabilities – from long-range fires and anti-ship weapons to
modernizing our nuclear triad. It’ll authorize further investments in
the defense industrial base and expand efficiency and accountability of
the lethal assistance degrading Russia’s military in Ukraine. It’ll
turbo-charge cooperation with Israel on future missile defense
technologies and ensure our closest ally in the Middle East can access
the U.S. capabilities it needs, when it needs them.” </p>
<p>Earlier this year, the Republican-majority U.S. House passed a more
conservative version of the NDAA that would have eliminated many
progressive policies providing access to abortion and transgender care.
Those amendments were not in the final version of the legislation that
passed Thursday.  </p>
<p>A joint Senate-House Conference committee worked out the compromise
legislation that was passed by both chambers this week.  </p>
<p>Rogers described the bill passed Thursday as a good compromise,
saying on the House floor Thursday, “It goes a long way toward ending
woke policies being forced on our service members by left wing
bureaucrats. It includes provisions that ban critical race theory and
require promotions based on merit. It includes several provisions that
require accountability from the administration like in its Special
Inspector General for Ukraine, Ukraine aid and the deadline for the DOD
to finally pass an audit.”  </p>
<p>Rep. Adam Smith, the ranking member on the House Armed Services
Committee said Thursday the NDAA “solidifies our alliances with our
European allies, with our allies in Asia and with Israel and our allies
in the Middle East to meet the threats that we face. You cannot oppose
this bill and claim that you support the national security of this
country.”  </p>
<p>Forty-five Democrats and seventy-three Republicans voted against the
NDAA Thursday, with many conservative Republicans objecting to the
extension of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The
controversial intelligence program allows the US government to collect
the communications of foreign nationals without a warrant. Conservatives
allege the program has been misused to violate the privacy of
Americans.    </p>
<p>“What’s being stated is it is impossible to oppose the National
Defense Authorization Act because we put a pay raise in it or because we
put something in there that is seemingly so important that we have to
ignore the critical destruction of our civil liberties by adding FISA
extension - without doing the reforms necessary to protect the American
people,” Republican Rep. Chip Roy said Thursday.  </p>
<p>Smith acknowledged that FISA authorizations are in need of reform.
 </p>
<p>“There’s no question about that. Nobody I know of, however, says that
it should completely go away. If we don’t do it on this bill, it
completely goes away on January 1, which is a huge national security
threat to this country - universally agree.”  </p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers are still negotiating the White House’s $106 billion
national security supplemental request that includes $60 billion in
military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine as well as nearly $14 billion
to assist Israel in the conflict with Hamas.</p>

The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a record high yesterday; the Nasdaq
and S&amp;P are up, as well. These jumps come after Federal Reserve
officials hinted at interest rate cuts in the new year. Lower rates are
good news for consumers spending more cautiously and companies that need
to borrow to expand. Also on the show: gas prices dip, and a $100
billion city in Malaysia sits empty.

<p>
Well, it’s happening. The days of a carefully curated
<a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a>
are over. Carl has decided to take a break after 10 years running the
site and I’m taking over which means chaos is about to ensue.
</p>
<p>
Just kidding. I am taking over the site though.
<a href="https://carlbarenbrug.com/minimalissimo-departure" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Carl
has written about the reasons behind his decision on his blog</a> so if
you want to know more head over to his blog. He was willing to just
leave the site up as an archive and stop posting but I can’t let that
happen.
</p>
<p>
Minimalissimo is such a nice project and has a massive archive so I
offered to take over the day-to-day operations. But I had one condition
and that was that I must be allowed to experiment with the site because
you know I can’t help myself when it comes to play with online side
projects.
</p>
<p>
I plan to write about the whole experience throughout the year and I’m
going to be very transparent about it so if you’re interested in some
behind-the-scenes keep an eye on this blog.

Minimalissimo <em>”Manu Edition”</em> starts on January 1st. Gonna be a

id="naval-officer-jailed-in-japan-in-deadly-crash-transferred-to-us-custody-his-family-says">Naval
Officer Jailed in Japan in Deadly Crash Transferred to US Custody, His
Family Says</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A Navy officer jailed in Japan over a deadly car crash
that killed two Japanese citizens has been transferred into U.S. custody
and is being returned to the United States, his family said
Thursday.</p>
<p>Lt. Ridge Alkonis had been serving a three-year prison sentence after
pleading guilty to the negligent driving deaths of an elderly woman and
her son-in-law in May 2021.</p>
<p>“After 507 days, Lt. Ridge Alkonis is on his way home to the United
States. We are encouraged by Ridge’s transfer back to the United States
but cannot celebrate until Ridge has been reunited with his family,” the
family, based in Dana Point, California, said in a statement to The
Associated Press. “We appreciate the efforts of the U.S. Government to
effect this transfer and are glad that an impartial set of judiciary
eyes will review his case for the first time.”</p>
<p>It was unclear where in the U.S. Alkonis is heading or whether upon
his arrival in the country he might be required to spend any additional
time behind bars under the terms of his transfer from Japan.</p>
<p>“We appreciate the efforts of the U.S. Government to effect this
transfer and are glad that an impartial set of judiciary eyes will
review his case for the first time,” the family statement said.</p>
<p>The statement added: “When the Biden Administration is presented with
the complete set of facts and circumstances surrounding the case, we’re
confident they will promptly recognize the absurdity of Ridge’s
conviction.”</p>
<p>Alkonis’ family has said the naval officer abruptly lost
consciousness in the car after a lunch and ice cream excursion with his
wife and children to Mount Fuji, causing him to slump over behind the
wheel after suffering acute mountain sickness. But Japanese prosecutors
and the judge who sentenced him contend he fell asleep while drowsy,
shirking a duty to pull over immediately.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2021, after a period of land-based assignments, the
Southern California native was preparing for a deployment as a
department head on the USS Benfold, a missile destroyer.</p>
<p>On May 29, 2021, with the assignment looming, his family set out for
an excursion of Mount Fuji hiking and sightseeing.</p>
<p>They had climbed a portion of the mountain and were back in the car,
heading to lunch and ice cream near the base of Mount Fuji. Alkonis was
talking with his daughter, then 7, when his family says he suddenly fell
unconscious behind the wheel. He was so out of it, they say, that
neither his daughter’s screams to wake up nor the impact of the
collision roused him.</p>
<p>After the crash near Fujinomiya, he was arrested by Japanese
authorities and held for 26 days in solitary confinement at a police
detention facility, interrogated multiple times a day and was not given
a medical treatment or evaluation, according to a statement of facts
provided by a family spokesman. That statement says that when American
authorities arrived to take Alkonis into custody and return him to a
U.S. base, he already was held by the Japanese.</p>
<p>He was indicted on a charge of a negligent driving, resulting in
death, and was sentenced to three years in prison.</p>
<p>After the sentencing, Alkonis’ family had sought to keep the case in
the public spotlight, including by gathering outside the White House.
President Joe Biden also raised the case during a meeting last May with
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.</p>
<p>Alkonis is a specialist in underseas warfare and acoustic engineering
who at the time of the crash had spent nearly seven years in Japan as a
civilian volunteer and naval officer.</p>

<p>Yesterday I
<a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/13.html#a140021">addressed</a> the
How Do I Write question, now let me address Why I Write. I write at
least partially because I know there are good people who love my
writing. The tech industry, to the extent that they remember me, resents
me. I get that. It’s sad, because I do care, I am one of them, as Diana
was one of the royals (see above). Anyway, I love to write because there
are people who love to read. And I feel connected to them. My mother was
the prototype. We weren’t very close in actual life, but she was a
devoted reader of my blog. It gave us a connection. And I assume all
daily or nightly readers of this blog have that kind of connection,
whether I hear from them or not. And sometimes you do
<a href="https://twitter.com/tanyaweiman/status/1735267625691701440">hear
from them</a>, and that’s especially lovely.</p>

Daedalus, to kite flying in China, to the development of hydrogen-filled

19th century England and Germany. Around the turn of […]</p>

News)</p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/12/24/santa.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I’ve
been re-bingeing the whole
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(TV_series)">Crown
series</a>, anticipating that there was going to be a new and
<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-crown/season-6/">final
series</a> of episodes, out today. I started watching the new one, and
all of a sudden the two princes, William and Harry, are actual people. I
have a lot of trouble with that, because of course I remember when they
were born. However I’m pretty sure I’ll go all the way through. There
are a lot of hours of entertainment in The Crown and a few scenes that
are truly spectacular
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBwQICiGRmw">like this</a>). I
remember the really good ones of course, but there’s an awful lot of
<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/schlock">schlock</a>.
One scene I had not remembered was a pretty good illustration of how
fucked up people can be. Princess Diana had just gone on a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqe-SuyAyWI">tour of NYC</a>,
her first international tour on her own, and it was (surprising to her)
a huge success. Another British invasion. The people of NYC loved Diana
(at least in the show, I don’t remember this, I was living in California
at the time). So she comes home, and the royal family, instead of
cheering her, were angry with her for being so charming. Go figure. Her
husband, Prince Charles is yelling at her and he asks her if she ever
considered how
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla">Camilla</a>,
Charles’ one true love, would feel about Diana being so popular. Diana
is <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gobsmacked">gobsmacked</a>
(as am I). Why would she think of that. How totally fucked up is that.
Why should anyone, being themselves, being happy, worry about how anyone
else might feel about their happiness? I’ve been in Diana’s position a
few times, achieving success, much deserved, and was reminded that this
upset people who (apparently) didn’t want me to succeed? I have even
been asked that question. If you ever feel that way, that someone else’s
happiness is meant to make you feel bad, remember Carl Sagan’s
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wupToqz1e2g">Pale Blue Dot</a>
video. Really, <i>no one cares</i> if you are offended by someone else’s
happiness. Remember, none of this stuff amounts to anything in the big
picture. We’re very small, all of us put together, in the grand scheme
of things. So if you’re happy, good for you! And one other question – is
re-bingeing actually a word?? <span style="opacity: 0.6"><span

<p>Hi folks, below is a letter to the Substack founders that I helped
draft as part of a group of publishers seeking answers to questions
about the platforming and monetizing of Nazis. We are all publishing the
letter on our own individual Substacks today for visibility, and to make
our readers aware of our asks and concerns. With any luck you already
have, or soon will have, seen this on a large number of other substacks.
Thanks for reading.</p>

<li>Massive Tesla recall is a ‘win’ … for Tesla

that’s nearly all the vehicles Tesla has sold in the U.S. to date. At
issue is the Autosteer functionality, and the recall follows an
investigation by the National Highway Transportation Safety
Administration (HTWSA) into a series of crashes that may have occurred
while Autopilot was in use. The updates will include added safety
controls and alerts, and further limit where drivers can use Autosteer,
<em>Wired</em> says. The recall is a “win” for Tesla,

Damon Lavrinc at Heatmap. “U.S. regulators did not conclude the
technology itself was unsafe, and also determined that drivers are
responsible for using Autopilot safely. This is what Tesla has contended
since the beginning, and it’s a rebuke to safety advocates, many local
legislators, and lawyers representing accident victims and their
families.”

Market Report</a> this morning, which says that global oil demand rose
in 2023 but that a slowdown has begun and will continue through 2024.
This, combined with supply growth from the U.S. (and elsewhere), will
“complicate efforts by key producers to defend their market share and
maintain elevated oil prices,” the agency concludes. The report is in
contrast to projections put forward by the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), which this week

it still expects demand for oil to grow next year by 2.25 million

Court Upholds Detention of US Reporter Gershkovich</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MOSCOW — A Moscow court on Thursday upheld a ruling to hold in
detention until January 30 U.S. reporter Evan Gershkovich, arrested in
Russia earlier this year on espionage charges.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old Wall Street Journal correspondent in Moscow, his
employer and the U.S. government have all rejected the spying
allegations.</p>
<p>“Evan Gershkovich will remain in custody until January 30, 2024,” the
Moscow city court said in a statement on social media, turning down an
appeal lodged late last month.</p>
<p>A video released by the court showed Gershkovich, who previously
worked for Agence France-Presse, standing in a cage for defendants
during Thursday’s hearing, smiling and wearing a dark-colored
sweater.</p>
<p>Gershkovich was arrested during a reporting trip at the end of March
in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, becoming the first Western reporter
to be held on spying charges in Russia since the Soviet era.</p>
<p>He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.</p>
<p>Russia this month also brought fresh charges against U.S.-Russian
dual citizen Alsu Kurmasheva, arrested in the central city of Kazan in
October and charged with failing to register as a “foreign agent.”</p>
<p>Her employer, Radio Free Europe/Liberty (RFE/RL), this week denounced
the fresh charges filed against her after reports she has also been
accused of violating rules against Ukraine war criticism.</p>

Hero of the COP28 Deal Is Technology</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-14, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDc5MDE0My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NDA2MDM5M30.1FRTUMJcLiEL_RfR3zMifOlC592aa_ZEoZ_DuZxwp2s/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Now it is over. Early on Wednesday morning, negotiators in Dubai reached
an agreement at the 28th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change, the global meeting otherwise known as
COP28.
</p>
<p>
Their final text for
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/cop28-agreement-5-things" target="_self">the
Global Stocktake</a> — a kind of report card on humanity’s progress on
its Paris Agreement goals — is contradictory and half-hearted. Instead
of blunt language instructing countries to “phase out fossil fuels,” it
instead provides a range of options that could let countries achieve
“deep, rapid, and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.” One
of these possibilities is the tripling of global renewable capacity;
another is a call for “transitioning away from fossil fuels.”
</p>
<p>
So far, this language — this call for leaving fossil fuels — has
attracted the most attention by far. Simon Stiell, the UN’s top climate
official,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/cop28-agreement-5-things" target="_self">said</a>
that it marked “the beginning of the end” of the fossil-fuel era, while
the climate journalist and activist Bill McKibben has argued that the
phrase can become
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/bill-mckibben-cop28-sentence" target="_self">a
useful tool for activists</a>, who can now beat it across the head of
the Biden administration.
</p>
<p>
But a separate phrase in the agreement caught my attention. Immediately
after calling for transitioning away from fossil fuels, the text makes a
different point: that the world must accelerate the development of
“zero- and low-emission technologies, including, <em>inter alia</em>,
renewables, nuclear, abatement and removal technologies such as carbon
capture and utilization and storage, particularly in hard-to-abate
sectors, and low-carbon hydrogen production.”
</p>
<p>
This language may rankle some readers because it seems to give pride of
place to carbon capture and storage technology, or CCS, which would
allow fossil fuel-burning plants to catch emissions before they enter
the atmosphere. (It also seems to conflate CCS with carbon removal
technology, even though they are different.) But I believe that the
overarching demand — the call for accelerating climate-friendly
technologies — represents a crucial insight, one that I could not stop
thinking about at the COP itself, and one that is linked to any
realistic demand to phase out fossil fuels. Here is that insight: The
world will only be able to decarbonize when it develops abundant energy
technologies that emit little carbon and that are price-competitive if
not <em>cheaper </em>than their fossil-fueled alternatives.
</p>
<p>
Just as COP28 began, the Rhodium Group, an energy research firm,
published a new study looking at how carbon pollution will rise and fall
through the end of the century. Unlike other such studies — which ask
either how the planet will fare if no new climate policy passes, or what
the world must do to avoid 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming — this new
study tried to look at what was <em>likely</em> to happen. Given what we
know about how countries’ emissions rise and fall with their economies,
and when and how they tend to pass climate policy, how much warming can
we expect by the end of the century?
</p>
<p>
As the report’s authors put it, the study was aimed not at policymakers,
but at policy takers — the officials, executives, engineers, and local
leaders who are starting to plan for the world of 2100.
</p>
<p>
Here’s the good news: Global greenhouse gas emissions are likely to peak
this decade, the report found. Sometime during the 2020s, humanity’s
emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other climate pollution will
reach an all-time high and begin to fall. (Right now, we emit
<a href="https://rhg.com/research/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2022/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
the equivalent of 50.6 billion tons</a> of the stuff every year.) This
will represent a world-historic turning point in our species’ effort to
govern the global climate system, and it will probably happen before
Morocco, Portugal, and
Spain<a href="https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/organisation/fifa-council/media-releases/fifa-council-takes-key-decisions-on-fifa-world-cup-tm-editions-in-2030-and-2034" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
host the 2030 World Cup</a>.
</p>
<p>
And that is roughly where the good news ends. Because unlike in rosy
net-zero studies where humanity’s carbon emissions peak and then rapidly
fall to zero, the report does <em>not </em>project any near-term
pollution plunge. Instead, global emissions waver and plateau through
the 2030s and 2040s, falling in some years, rising slightly in others,
cutting an unmistakably downward trend while failing to get anywhere
close to zero. By 2060, annual emissions will have fallen to 39
gigatons, only 22% below today’s levels.
</p>
<p>
And — worse news, now — that is as low as emissions will ever get this
century, the report projects. Driven by explosive economic growth in
Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, global emissions begin to rise —
slowly but inexorably — starting in the 2060s. They keep rising in the
2070s, 2080s, and 2090s. By the year 2090, emissions will have reached
44 gigatons, only 13% below today’s levels and roughly where emissions
stood in 2003.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How Greenhouse Gas Emissions Could Fall — Then Rise — in the
21st Century</strong>
</p>
<p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="c0ee9d6ff988129f1ae1f3e43085d35b" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="57c58" loading="lazy" src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDc5MDg0MC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NjM0ODE5Mn0.fIZNhLanLkHnKgOypEQ36GoZ200yKIofS-VtKjJJ9WA/image.png?width=980"/>
<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Rhodium
Group</small>
</p>
<p>
In other words, after a century of work to fight climate change,
humanity will find itself roughly where it began. But now, with several
thousand additional gigatons of emissions in the atmosphere, the planet
will be about 2.8 degrees Celsius warmer (or about 5 degrees
Fahrenheit). At its high end estimate, temperatures could rise as much
as 4 degrees Celsius, or more than 7 degrees Fahrenheit.
</p>
<p>
This temperature rise will be caused by legacy emissions from polluters
like the United States and China, but as the century goes on, it will
increasingly come from Asian and African countries such as Vietnam,
Indonesia, Nigeria, Kenya, and others. Why? It’s not like these
countries, say, reject renewables or electric vehicles: In fact, Rhodium
anticipates that renewables will have grown up to 22-fold by the end of
the century.
</p>
<p>
Instead, emissions rise because fossil fuels are cheap and globally
abundant — they remain one of the easiest ways to power an explosively
growing society — and because of the growth of the so-called
hard-to-abate sectors in these countries are slated to grow just as
quickly as the economies themselves. Indonesia, Nigeria, and Vietnam
will demand many megatons of new steel, cement, and chemicals to furnish
their growing societies; right now, the only economical way to make
those materials requires releasing immense amounts of carbon pollution
into the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
Let’s be clear: Rhodium’s report is a projection, not a prophecy. It
should not provoke despair, I think, but determination. Many of the
so-called hard-to-abate activities, such as steel or petrochemical
making, should more aptly be called
activities-that-we-haven’t-tried-very-hard-to-abate yet; people will
likely find a way to do them by the middle of the century. (When I
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/bill-gates-cop28-green-premium-trump" target="_self">asked
Bill Gates</a> what he thought about the Rhodium Group’s findings, he
replied that predicting the carbon intensity of certain activities in
2060 was all but impossible: We might have safe, cheap, and abundant
nuclear fission by then, or even nuclear fusion.)
</p>
<p>
Yet it heralds a shift in climate geopolitics that, while it has not yet
happened, is not so far away. Since the modern era of global climate
politics began in 1990, most carbon emissions have come from just a
handful of countries: China, the United States, and the 37 other rich,
developed democracies that make up the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, or OECD. These countries have emitted 55%
of climate pollution since 1990, while the rest of the world — the
remaining low- and middle-income countries — have emitted only 45%.
</p>
<p>
But from now to 2100, that relationship is set to reverse. Through the
end of the century, China and the OECD countries emit only 40% of total
global emissions, according to Rhodium’s projections. The rest of the
world, meanwhile, will emit 60% of global emissions.
</p>
<p>
In other words, decarbonization will soon become a challenge for
<em>middle-income</em> countries. These countries will not be able to
spend extra to buy climate-friendly technologies, but they are simply
too populous for rich countries to subsidize. At the same time, these
countries lack an existing fleet of fossil-fuel-consuming equipment, so
they will not need to transition <em>away</em> from fossil fuels in the
first place. Unlike in the United States, where we will have to shut
down our oil-and-gas economy as we build a new one to replace it, Kenya
or Indonesia can more or less build a climate-friendly middle-class
economy <em>de novo, </em>much in the same way that in the 2000s
countries
<a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/a-13-2008-05-19-voa22/401756.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“leapfrogged”
landline telephones</a> and adopted cell phones. Yet countries will only
be able to leapfrog the fossil-fuel era if the climate equivalent of
cell phones exist: if climate-friendly technologies are plentiful,
useful, and price-competitive.
</p>
<p>
That’s not all it will take, of course. The world will have to phase
down the production and consumption of fossil fuels, because the
existence of climate-friendly technologies will not guarantee their use.
Humanity may also have to create and enforce a strong moral taboo around
burning fossil fuels, much in the same way that it has created a taboo
around, say, child labor. But none of that can happen unless
climate-friendly alternatives exist: Otherwise countries will ensure
that they gain access to the energy that their development requires.

id="us-taiwan-discuss-broadening-taiwans-international-participation">US,
Taiwan Discuss Broadening Taiwan’s International Participation</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>State Department — The United States and Taiwan are exploring ways to
expand Taiwan’s participation in the United Nations system and other
international forums, as well as addressing a range of global
challenges, including public health, aviation safety and climate
change.</p>
<p>The most recent routine consultation between the U.S. and Taiwan took
place Wednesday, days after the Chinese delegation at COP28 opposed
calls to include Taiwan in the United Nations climate talks in
Dubai.</p>
<p>All participants in the latest U.S.-Taiwan talks “recognized the
importance of working closely with likeminded partners who share our
concerns regarding attempts to exclude Taiwan from the international
community,” according to the U.S. State Department in a statement.</p>
<p>Taiwan Relations Act</p>
<p>Senior American officials have said Washington’s “One China” policy
is “distinct” from Beijing’s “One China” principle. The U.S. policy is
guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the Three Joint Communiques and the
Six Assurances. China has objected to the Taiwan Relations Act and
deemed it as invalid.</p>
<p>The Taiwan Relations Act has stated that “nothing in this Act may be
construed as a basis for supporting the exclusion or expulsion of Taiwan
from continued membership in any international financial institution or
any other international organization.”</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party has never ruled Taiwan but claims
sovereignty over the island, which became home to the Chinese
Nationalist government after its defeat in 1949. During the U.N. climate
talks held in the United Arab Emirates, Chinese officials lodged a
protest after calls to include Taiwan’s participation in the climate
summit by other countries.</p>
<p>“China has noted that during the meeting a handful of countries
ignore the fact that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China and make
noises about the participation by the Taiwan authorities in the COP,” a
member of the Chinese delegation said via a translator in the plenary
hall in Dubai.</p>
<p>Wednesday, officials from the State Department and Taiwan’s Ministry
of Foreign Affairs discussed near-term opportunities to support Taiwan’s
participation in the World Health Assembly (WHA) and other global public
health bodies, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), as
well as Taiwan’s meaningful participation in other multilateral
organizations.</p>
<p>World Health Organization and International Civil Aviation
Organization</p>
<p>The Beijing government has been blocking Taiwan’s representation at
WHA meetings after the self-ruled democracy elected Tsai Ing-wen, a
China skeptic, as president in 2016.</p>
<p>China has also blocked Taiwan’s participation in ICAO assemblies
since 2013.</p>
<p>Since the U.S. switched its diplomatic recognition from the
government of Taipei to Beijing in 1979, Washington has insisted that
the two sides should resolve their political disputes peacefully.</p>
<p>Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns said “fundamental
differences” over Taiwan persist in Washington’s relationship with
Beijing.</p>
<p>The top U.S. diplomat on China said the United States will continue
to implement the Taiwan Relations Act and help Taiwan with its defense
needs, renewing the U.S. commitment to maintain peace and stability
across the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>In recent months, China has been increasing its military activities
near the strait.  The United States has voiced concerns about any
Chinese interference through military coercion, as Taiwan prepares for a
presidential election in January 2024.</p>
<p>“I think what we can do is to insist that the people in Taiwan have
an opportunity to vote freely on January 13,” Burns told an audience
during a seminar hosted by the U.S.-based Council on Foreign
Relations.</p>
<p>In Beijing, Chinese officials said the election in Taiwan “is purely
China’s internal affair.”</p>
<p>“Taiwan independence” means war and “Taiwan independence” is a dead
end, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said during a
recent briefing.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with VOA, U.S. Senior Official for Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation Matt Murray said, “We certainly want to make sure
there are opportunities for engagement” between the U.S. and Taiwan in
international economic forums, as Taiwan is one of the top trading
partners and investors in the United States.</p>
<p>Morris Chang, founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company,
represented Taiwan during the APEC summit in San Francisco in
mid-November, where he held talks with U.S. Vice President Kamala
Harris.</p>
<p>The two discussed the U.S.-Taiwan “relationship on the economy and
technology,” Harris said in a social media post on X, formerly Twitter.
Chang also had a pull-aside meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony
Blinken during the APEC meetings, according to Murray.</p>
<p>The last U.S.-Taiwan working group meeting on international
organizations took place in April.</p>

says overclocking blows a hidden fuse on Ryzen Threadripper 7000 to show
if you’ve overclocked the chip, but it doesn’t automatically void your
CPU’s warranty</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>A recent discovery that overclocking AMD’s latest chips blows a fuse
to denote the chip has been overclocked has led to slightly misleading
claims that it will automatically void the chips’ warranty for any type
of failure. However, AMD clarified to Tom’s Hardware that overclocking
AMD’s Ryzen Threadripper Pro 7000 (Storm Peak) and non-Pro lineup, among
the best workstation CPUs, doesn’t automatically void the processor’s
warranty. ↫ Zhiye Liu at Tom’s Hardware Something about these fuses in
processors doesn’t sit right with me.</p>

CPU</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>We’re going to cover the Cortex A57 as implemented in the Nintendo
Switch’s Nvidia Tegra X1. The Tegra X1 targets a wide range of
applications including mobile devices and automobiles. It focuses on
providing high GPU performance in a limited power envelope, making it
perfect for a portable gaming console like the Switch. Tegra X1 consumes
117,6 mm2 on TSMC’s 20 nm (20 SoC) process and uses a quad core A57
cluster to provide the bulk of its CPU power. Each Cortex A57 core
consumes just under 2 mm2 of area, and the quad core A57 cluster takes
13.16 mm2. ↫ Clamchowder at Chips and Cheese An old SoC still doing
excellent work in the Switch.</p>

<h2 id="frame-pointers-enabled-by-default-in-ubuntu-24.04-lts">Frame
pointers enabled by default in Ubuntu 24.04 LTS</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>In collaboration with Polar Signals we have committed that beginning
with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, our GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) package will
enable frame pointers by default for 64-bit platforms. All packages in
Ubuntu, with very few exceptions, will be rebuilt with frame pointers
enabled, making them easier to profile and subsequently optimise. “I’ve
enabled frame pointers at huge scale for Java and glibc and studied the
CPU overhead for this change, which is typically less than 1% and
usually so close to zero that it is hard to measure. Frame pointers
allow more complete CPU profiling and off-CPU profiling. The performance
wins that these can provide far outweigh the comparatively tiny loss in
performance. Ubuntu enabling frame pointers by default will be a huge
win for performance engineering and the default developer experience”.
said Brendan Gregg, computer performance expert and Intel Fellow. ↫
Oliver Smith on the official Ubuntu blog So I guess the very minor
performance regression is supposed to be compensated for by
optimisations in individual packages that frame pointers will help
realise.</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-14, from: Max Halford Blog</p>
<p>Funnel metrics as products I talked about metric decomposition in a
previous article, and how it can be used to explain why metrics change
values over time. That article explained how to decompose a sum, as well
as a ratio. In this article, I’ll explain how to decompose a product.
revenue = impressions * click_rate * conversion_rate * spend The
decomposition in this article isn’t limited to funnels. It can be
applied to any metric that is expressed as a product of factors.</p>
