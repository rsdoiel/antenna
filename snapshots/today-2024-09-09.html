id="freed-from-russian-jail-american-journalist-is-focused-on-colleagues-still-imprisoned">Freed
from Russian jail, American journalist is focused on colleagues still
imprisoned</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Being able to open a door whenever she wants is one of
the many freedoms Alsu Kurmasheva is enjoying after months of wrongful
detention in Russia.</p>
<p>“I’m enjoying freedom. I’m loving every minute of it,” the American
journalist told VOA, just a few weeks after she was freed as part of a
historic prisoner swap between the United States and Russia.</p>
<p>An editor with VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in
Prague, Kurmasheva was back in Washington late last month to accept an
award from the National Press Club. The visit was the start of what she
described as her “thank you tour.”</p>
<p>A dual U.S.-Russian national, Kurmasheva traveled to Russia in May
2023 to visit her ailing mother in the Tatarstan city of Kazan. But
authorities blocked her from leaving and later jailed her for more than
nine months on bogus charges.</p>
<p>“What happened to me was so wrong, and it shouldn’t happen to any
innocent person. It shouldn’t happen to any journalist,” Kurmasheva
said. “I was jailed for 288 days, and every minute of it is suffering.
It’s going through humiliation. And inmates in Russia and Belarus, they
don’t have any rights.”</p>
<p>In prison, daily life was monotonous for Kurmasheva. “It was
endless,” she said, adding that she forced herself to remain
optimistic.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t write in my letters to my mom or to my husband or family
or friends that I was falling apart, that I was collapsing, because I
knew they were trying so hard to get me out,” she said.</p>
<p>Letters that she received from supporters from all over the world
helped, said Kurmasheva, holding up some of the postcards she received
from supporters in New York and Oregon.</p>
<p>“When my spirit was really low, I just opened my cards and letters,
and I kept reading them,” she said.</p>
<p>At one point during her detention, Kurmasheva shared a cell with nine
other women. There was more social interaction, she said, but that
didn’t make the situation any easier.</p>
<p>“The doors were still locked, and every woman was there with her own
bad luck and uncertain future,” she said.</p>
<p>When it was time for Kurmasheva’s release, her captors obscured that
she was being freed, telling the journalist she was heading to a
destination other than Moscow.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until she was hugging her husband and daughters at Joint
Base Andrews outside Washington that reality set in. “Only then I felt
it was real,” Kurmasheva said. “That was the moment I was dreaming of
for months and months.”</p>
<p>Before returning home to Prague, Kurmasheva went to a military base
in Texas, where she received care from doctors and psychologists.</p>
<p>The recovery process after wrongful detention varies greatly from
person to person, according to Katherine Porterfield, a consulting
psychologist at the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma in New
York.</p>
<p>“The experience of incarceration is one of loss of liberty, loss of
agency, loss of freedom of movement, as well as lots of other
disconnections,” Porterfield told VOA, speaking generally about how
journalists and others are helped after a wrongful detention.</p>
<p>“It’s basically moving a person from powerlessness to a sense of
agency again,” Porterfield said.</p>
<p>Throughout Kurmasheva’s imprisonment, press freedom groups criticized
the State Department for not declaring her wrongfully detained. The
designation — which The Wall Street Journal’s Gershkovich received
within two weeks of his arrest — opens up extra resources and support
for families and commits the U.S. government to secure their
release.</p>
<p>The State Department in August said it had declared Kurmasheva
wrongfully detained shortly before the prisoner swap took place.</p>
<p>“If any journalist is detained anywhere in the world doing their job,
they should immediately be designated as wrongfully detained,”
Kurmasheva said.</p>
<p>Kurmasheva’s own freedom feels bittersweet, she admits. At the top of
her mind are her three RFE/RL colleagues who are still unjustly
jailed.</p>
<p>Andrey Kuznechyk and Ihar Losik are jailed in Belarus, and Vladyslav
Yesypenko is jailed in Russian-occupied Crimea. RFE/RL has condemned all
three cases as politically motivated.</p>
<p>Kurmasheva isn’t sure whether she wants to stick with journalism or
try something new, she said, but she does know that she wants to help
free her jailed colleagues and other political prisoners.</p>
<p>“I feel the pain that their families are going through,” she said. “I
feel the pain of those journalists.”</p>
<p>With Kurmasheva’s own family, she takes every opportunity to thank
her daughters, as well as her husband, for fighting so hard to secure
her release.</p>
<p>“They were the leaders of my advocacy group. It all started at home,”
she said.</p>
<p>Noting how her daughters have matured significantly in the time
Kurmasheva was in jail, she says she is relishing her newly reclaimed
freedom and figuring out what comes next.</p>
<p>“I want to enjoy my life from now on,” she said.</p>

attend funeral for American activist witness says was shot dead by
Israeli troops</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NABLUS, West Bank — The Western-backed Palestinian Authority held a
funeral procession Monday for a U.S.-Turkish dual national activist who
a witness says was shot and killed by Israeli forces while demonstrating
against settlements in the occupied West Bank. </p>
<p>Dozens of mourners — including several leading PA officials —
attended the procession. Security forces carried the body of Aysenur
Ezgi Eygi which was draped in a Palestinian flag while a traditional
black-and-white checkered scarf covered her face. The 26-year-old’s body
was then placed into the back of a Palestinian ambulance. </p>
<p>Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Oncu Keceli said Turkey was
working on repatriating Eygi’s remains for burial in the Aegean coastal
town of Didim as per her family’s wishes, but “because the land crossing
from the Palestinian territories to Jordan was closed as of Sunday, the
ministry was trying to have the body flown directly to Turkey.” </p>
<p>U.S. officials did not respond to a request for comment. </p>
<p>Jonathan Pollak, an Israeli peace activist who participated in
Friday’s protest, said Israeli forces shot her on Friday in the city of
Nablus while posing no threat, adding that the killing happened during a
period of calm after clashes between soldiers and Palestinian
protesters. Pollak said he then saw two Israeli soldiers mount the roof
of a nearby home, train a gun in the group’s direction and fired, with
one of the bullets striking Eygi in the head. </p>
<p>The Israeli military said it was looking into reports that troops had
killed a foreign national while firing at an “instigator of violent
activity” in the area of the protest. </p>
<p>The West Bank has seen a surge of violence since the Israel-Hamas war
began in October, with increasing Israeli raids, attacks by Palestinian
militants on Israelis, and attacks by Israeli settlers on
Palestinians.</p>

id="google-faces-new-antitrust-trial-after-ruling-declaring-search-engine-a-monopoly">Google
faces new antitrust trial after ruling declaring search engine a
monopoly</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ALEXANDRIA, Va. — One month after a judge declared Google’s search
engine an illegal monopoly, the tech giant faces another antitrust
lawsuit that threatens to break up the company, this time over its
advertising technology.</p>
<p>The Justice Department and a coalition of states contend that Google
built and maintains a monopoly over the technology that matches online
publishers to advertisers. Dominance over the software on both the buy
side and the sell side of the transaction enables Google to keep as much
as 36 cents on the dollar when it brokers sales between publishers and
advertisers, the government contends in court papers.</p>
<p>Google says the government’s case is based on an internet of
yesteryear, when desktop computers ruled and internet users carefully
typed precise World Wide Web addresses into URL fields. Advertisers now
are more likely to turn to social media companies like TikTok or
streaming TV services like Peacock to reach audiences.</p>
<p>In recent years, Google Networks, the division of the Mountain View,
California-based tech giant that includes such services as AdSense and
Google Ad Manager that are at the heart of the case, actually have seen
declining revenue, from $31.7 billion in 2021 to $31.3 billion in 2023,
according to the company’s annual reports.</p>
<p>The trial over the alleged ad tech monopoly begins Monday in
Alexandria, Virginia. It initially was going to be a jury trial, but
Google maneuvered to force a bench trial, writing a check to the federal
government for more than $2 million to moot the only claim brought by
the government that required a jury.</p>
<p>The case will now be decided by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema,
who was appointed to the bench by former President Bill Clinton and is
best known for high-profile terrorism trials including Sept. 11
defendant Zacarias Moussaoui. Brinkema, though, also has experience with
highly technical civil trials, working in a courthouse that sees an
outsize number of patent infringement cases.</p>
<p>The Virginia case comes on the heels of a major defeat for Google
over its search engine. which generates the majority of the company’s
$307 billion in annual revenue. A judge in the District of Columbia
declared the search engine a monopoly, maintained in part by tens of
billions of dollars Google pays each year to companies like Apple to
lock in Google as the default search engine presented to consumers when
they buy iPhones and other gadgets.</p>
<p>In that case, the judge has not yet imposed any remedies. The
government hasn’t offered its proposed sanctions, though there could be
close scrutiny over whether Google should be allowed to continue to make
exclusivity deals that ensure its search engine is consumers’ default
option.</p>
<p>Peter Cohan, a professor of management practice at Babson College,
said the Virginia case could potentially be more harmful to Google
because the obvious remedy would be requiring it to sell off parts of
its ad tech business that generate billions of dollars in annual
revenue.</p>
<p>“Divestitures are definitely a possible remedy for this second case,”
Cohan said “It could be potentially more significant than initially
meets the eye.”</p>
<p>In the Virginia trial, the government’s witnesses are expected to
include executives from newspaper publishers including The New York
Times Co. and Gannett, and online news sites that the government
contends have faced particular harm from Google’s practices.</p>
<p>“Google extracted extraordinary fees at the expense of the website
publishers who make the open internet vibrant and valuable,” government
lawyers wrote in court papers. “As publishers generate less money from
selling their advertising inventory, publishers are pushed to put more
ads on their websites, to put more content behind costly paywalls, or to
cease business altogether.”</p>
<p>Google disputes that it charges excessive fees compared to its
competitors. The company also asserts the integration of its technology
on the buy side, sell side and in the middle assures ads and web pages
load quickly and enhance security. And it says customers have options to
work with outside ad exchanges.</p>
<p>Google says the government’s case is improperly focused on display
ads and banner ads that load on web pages accessed through a desktop
computer and fails to take into account consumers’ migration to mobile
apps and the boom in ads placed on social media sites over the last 15
years.</p>
<p>The government’s case “focuses on a limited type of advertising
viewed on a narrow subset of websites when user attention migrated
elsewhere years ago,” Google’s lawyers write in a pretrial filing. “The
last year users spent more time accessing websites on the ‘open web,’
rather than on social media, videos, or apps, was 2012.”</p>
<p>The trial, which is expected to last several weeks, is taking place
in a courthouse that rigidly adheres to traditional practices, including
a resistance to technology in the courtroom. Cellphones are banned from
the courthouse, to the chagrin of a tech press corps accustomed at the
District of Columbia trial to tweeting out live updates as they
happen.</p>
<p>Even the lawyers, and there are many on both sides, are limited in
their technology. At a pretrial hearing Wednesday, Google’s lawyers made
a plea to be allowed more than the two computers each side is permitted
to have in the courtroom during trial. Brinkema rejected it.</p>
<p>“This is an old-fashioned courtroom,” she said.</p>

suggests sharks are abandoning coral reefs due to warming ocean waters
caused by climate change. Grey reef sharks tend to stay close to shallow
reef habitats in the Indo-Pacific, but the research team, led by marine
scientists at Lancaster University, found that warmer waters are forcing
the sharks to leave for extended periods of time. Their absence could
further disrupt reef ecosystems. “Faced with a trade-off, sharks must
decide whether to leave the relative safety of the reef and expend
greater energy to remain cool or stay on a reef in suboptimal conditions
but conserve energy,”

id="authorities-vow-relentless-search-as-manhunt-for-interstate-shooter-enters-third-day-in-kentucky">Authorities
vow relentless search as manhunt for interstate shooter enters third day
in Kentucky</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LONDON, Ky. — As a grueling manhunt stretched into a third day Monday
for a suspect in an interstate shooting that struck 12 vehicles and
wounded five people, authorities vowed to keep up a relentless search as
the stress level remained high for a rural area where some schools
canceled classes.</p>
<p>Authorities have been searching a rugged, hilly area of southeastern
Kentucky since Saturday evening, when a gunman began shooting at drivers
on Interstate 75 near London, a small city of about 8,000 people located
about 75 miles (120 kilometers) south of Lexington.</p>
<p>The search was temporarily suspended once darkness fell Sunday night,
but was set to resume Monday morning.</p>
<p>“We’re not going to quit until we do lay hands on him,” Laurel County
Sheriff John Root said Sunday night.</p>
<p>Joseph A. Couch, 32, was named first as a person of interest and
later as a suspect in the shooting after authorities said they recovered
his SUV on a service road near the crime scene. They later found a
semi-automatic weapon nearby that they believe was used in the shooting,
said Deputy Gilbert Acciardo, a spokesperson for the local sheriff’s
office.</p>
<p>On Sunday, as another day of searching was ending without any sign of
the suspect, Acciardo acknowledged the frustration that law enforcement
officers and people who live near the search area are feeling.</p>
<p>“As this continues, it becomes more stressful for the community, it
becomes more stressful for the officers that are there because we’re
looking … and we’re trying to find him, and we haven’t found him,” he
said.</p>
<p>State police Master Trooper Scottie Pennington, a spokesman for the
London state police post, said troopers are being brought in from around
the state to aid the manhunt. He described the extensive search area as
“walking in a jungle” with machetes needed to cut through thickets of
woods.</p>
<p>Acciardo said it appears that the attacker planned the shooting for
that location because it is very remote and the terrain is hilly, rocky
and hard to navigate.</p>
<p>With the gunman still at large, numerous area school districts
canceled classes for Monday. Pennington urged area residents to lock
doors, keep porch lights on and monitor security cameras. The search was
focused on a remote area about eight miles north of London.</p>
<p>Authorities sought to reassure residents that they believe the
suspect will be found.</p>
<p>“We’re doing everything that we can do,” Root said, adding, ”Just be
confident.”</p>
<p>Authorities said Couch purchased the weapon and about 1,000 rounds of
ammunition Saturday morning in London. Couch has a military background,
having served in the National Guard for at least four years, said
Capt. Richard Dalrymple of the Laurel County Sheriff’s Office.</p>
<p>Authorities initially said nine vehicles were struck by gunfire, but
later increased that number to 12, saying some people did not realize
their cars had been hit by bullets until they arrived home. They said
the gunman fired a total of 20 to 30 rounds.</p>
<p>Couch most recently lived in Woodbine, a small community about 20
miles (32 kilometers) south of the shooting scene. Acciardo said
authorities found his abandoned vehicle Saturday and then an AR-15 rifle
on Sunday in a wooded area near a highway where “he could have shot down
upon the interstate.” A phone believed to be Couch’s was also found by
law enforcement, but the battery had been taken out.</p>
<p>Some residents of Laurel County were on edge as authorities searched
with a drone, helicopter and on foot in a remote and sparsely populated
wooded area near the busy interstate.</p>
<p>Cody Shepherd, sipping a bloody mary outdoors while waiting to watch
a football game at the Pour Boyz Sports Lounge in London on Sunday, said
locals were abuzz with speculation. A resident of London, he was at a
party Saturday at a friend’s house about 10 miles (16 kilometers) south
of where the shooting occurred.</p>
<p>“We were listening to the police scanners all night,” he said, adding
they heard sirens and saw a helicopter overhead.</p>
<p>On Sunday, several local churches canceled services. But Rodney
Goodlett, pastor of Faith Assembly of God in London, was helping direct
traffic as parishioners gathered for a morning service. He expected the
search would hold down attendance.</p>
<p>“This is tragic, obviously, that somebody would randomly do violent
acts,” he said. “You hear media things taking place all around our
country, but then when it hits home, it’s a little bit of a wake-up
call.”</p>
<p>Acciardo said authorities are being inundated with tips from the
public and are following up on each one in case it could help them find
the shooter. When the search has been suspended at night, specially
trained officers have been deployed in strategic locations in the woods
to prevent the gunman from slipping out of the area.</p>
<p>“We’ve got to get him,” Acciardo said.</p>

id="a-911-anniversary-tradition-is-handed-down-to-a-new-generation">A
9/11 anniversary tradition is handed down to a new generation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — A poignant phrase echoes when 9/11 victims’ relatives
gather each year to remember the loved ones they lost in the terror
attacks.</p>
<p>“I never got to meet you.”</p>
<p>It is the sound of generational change at ground zero, where
relatives read out victims’ names on every anniversary of the attacks.
Nearly 3,000 people were killed when al-Qaida hijackers crashed four
jetliners into the twin towers, the Pentagon and a field in southwest
Pennsylvania on Sept. 11, 2001.</p>
<p>Some names are read out by children or young adults who were born
after the strikes. Last year’s observance featured 28 such young people
among more than 140 readers. Young people are expected again at this
year’s ceremony Wednesday.</p>
<p>Some are the children of victims whose partners were pregnant. More
of the young readers are victims’ nieces, nephews or grandchildren. They
have inherited stories, photos, and a sense of solemn
responsibility.</p>
<p>Being a “9/11 family” reverberates through generations, and
commemorating and understanding the Sept. 11 attacks one day will be up
to a world with no first-hand memory of them.</p>
<p>“It’s like you’re passing the torch on,” says Allan Aldycki, 13.</p>
<p>He read the names of his grandfather and several other people the
last two years, and plans to do so on Wednesday. Aldycki keeps mementoes
in his room from his grandfather Allan Tarasiewicz, a firefighter.</p>
<p>The teen told the audience last year that he’s heard so much about
his grandfather that it feels like he knew him, “but still, I wish I had
a chance to really know you,” he added.</p>
<p>Allan volunteered to be a reader because it makes him feel closer to
his grandfather, and he hopes to have children who’ll participate.</p>
<p>“It’s an honor to be able to teach them because you can let them know
their heritage and what to never forget,” he said by phone from central
New York. He said he already finds himself teaching peers who know
little or nothing about 9/11.</p>
<p>When it comes time for the ceremony, he looks up information about
the lives of each person whose name he’s assigned to read.</p>
<p>“He reflects on everything and understands the importance of what it
means to somebody,” his mother, Melissa Tarasiewicz, said.</p>
<p>Reciting the names of the dead is a tradition that extends beyond
ground zero. War memorials honor fallen military members by speaking
their names aloud. Some Jewish organizations host readings of Holocaust
victims’ names on the international day of remembrance, Yom Hashoah.</p>
<p>The names of the 168 people killed in the 1995 bombing of a federal
building in Oklahoma City are read annually at the memorial there.</p>
<p>On Sept. 11 anniversaries, the Pentagon’s ceremony includes military
members or officials reading the names of the 184 people killed there.
The Flight 93 National Memorial has victims’ relatives and friends read
the list of the 40 passengers and crew members whose lives ended at the
rural site near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The hourslong observance at the 9/11 Memorial in New York is almost
exclusively dedicated to the names of the 2,977 victims at all three
sites, plus the six people killed in the 1993 World Trade Center
bombing. All are read by relatives who volunteer and are chosen by
lottery.</p>
<p>Each is given a subset of names to render aloud. Readers also
generally speak briefly about their own lost kin, frequently in touching
detail.</p>
<p>“I think often about how, if you were still here, you would be one of
my best friends, looking at colleges with me, getting me out of trouble
with Mom and Dad, hanging out at the Jersey Shore,” Capri Yarosz said
last year of her slain uncle, New York firefighter Christopher Michael
Mozzillo.</p>
<p>Now 17, she grew up with a homemade baby book about him and a family
that still mentions him in everyday conversation.</p>
<p>“Chris would have loved that” is a phrase often heard around the
house.</p>
<p>She has read twice at the trade center ceremony.</p>
<p>“It means a lot to me that I can kind of keep alive my uncle’s name
and just keep reading everybody else’s name, so that more of the
upcoming generations will know,” she said by phone from her family’s
home in central New Jersey. “I feel good that I can pass down the
importance of what happened.”</p>
<p>Her two younger sisters also have read names, and one is preparing to
do so again Wednesday. Their mother, Pamela Yarosz, has never been able
to steel herself to sign up.</p>
<p>“I don’t have that strength. It’s too hard for me,” says Pamela
Yarosz, who is Mozzillo’s sister. “They’re braver.”</p>
<p>By now, many of the children of 9/11 victims — such as Melissa
Tarasiewicz, who was just out of high school when her father died — have
long since grown up. But about 100 were born after the attacks killed
one of their parents, and are now young adults.</p>
<p>“Though we never met, I am honored to carry your name and legacy with
me. I thank you for giving me this life and family,” Manuel DaMota
Jr. said of his father, a woodworker and project manager, during last
year’s ceremony.</p>
<p>One young reader after another at the event commemorated aunts,
uncles, great-uncles, grandfathers and grandmothers whom the children
have missed throughout their lives.</p>
<p>“My whole life, my dad has said I reminded him of you.”</p>
<p>“I wish you got to take me fishing.”</p>
<p>“I wish I had more of you than just a picture on a frame.”</p>
<p>“Even though I never got to meet you, I will never forget you.”</p>

<h2 id="linuxs-bedtime-routine">Linux’s bedtime routine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>How does Linux move from an awake machine to a hibernating one? How
does it then manage to restore all state? These questions led me to read
way too much C in trying to figure out how this particular
hardware/software boundary is navigated. ↫ Jacob Adams So this is a lot
deeper of a dive than I expected, and it blows my mind just how complex
sleep, hibernating, and waking a computer really is. Instinctively you
know this, but seeing it spelled out like this really drives that point
home – and this only covers going into hibernation. It also highlights
how hard it must be for the developers involved to keep this working at
all, especially on the wide variety of machines and hardware
combinations Linux runs on. It wasn’t too log ago that pretty much the
only platform where sleeping and waking worked reliably was Mac OS X
with its controlled, small hardware selection, so it’s kind of
remarkable this works at all on Linux now. I haven’t had to worry about
sleeping and waking with Linux for quite a while now, and it’s one of
those things that “just works” so I never have to think about it. This
definitely wasn’t always the case, though, and on both Linux and Windows
I would just turn the whole feature off since it rarely worked reliably,
especially on desktops. I’m sure it still breaks for people, but for me,
it’s been rock solid, and reading through the linked article, I’m even
more amazed about this than I already was.</p>

id="kde-to-focus-on-improving-developer-experience-input-methods">KDE to
focus on improving developer experience, input methods</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>The KDE project is currently having its yearly conference – Akademy –
and at the conference, the project announced its goals for the coming
years. The KDE community has charted its course for the coming years,
focusing on three interconnected paths that converge on a single point:
community. These paths aim to improve user experience, support
developers, and foster community growth. ↫ Farid Abdelnour on the KDE
Blogs First, the project intends to make it easier for developers to
build KDE applications. They want to do this in various ways, but most
notably they want to improve the developer experience for people writing
KDE applications in languages other than C++, such as Rust or Python.
This is a very welcome goal, as I feel there’s definitely a bit of a
lack of new KDE applications, and as any other open source project, KDE
can always use more developers. Second, KDE is going to focus on
improving the input experience, as in the various ways you interact with
your computer. Accessibility, and the more complex input methods people
with accessibility needs require, are also part of this goal, but it
also covers simpler things like mice with tons of buttons, drawing
tablets, 2-in-1 laptops, and so on. I’m assuming this also includes
controlling the various RGB stuff found in every keyboard and mouse
these days, as this is something KDE has already been making inroads
into. The third and final goal is one strongly related to the first
goal, as it involves community outreach to attract new contributors.
This covers not just individual contributors, but also support from
institutions, organisations, and I’m guessing companies, too. With Valve
opting for KDE for its Steam Deck, I wouldn’t be surprised to see some
more involvement from that direction, too, which meshes well with the
input goal mentioned above. If you all keep becoming Patreons and
donating to us, I might be able to actually go to Akademy next year and
be a fly on the wall for some more in-depth reporting from such a
conference. I can’t guarantee anything – especially since I have two
small children, live far away from everything here in the Arctic, and
have serious anxiety problems to take into account, but it’s definitely
a goal for me for next year.</p>

id="us-congress-takes-up-a-series-of-bills-targeting-china-from-drones-to-drugs">US
Congress takes up a series of bills targeting China, from drones to
drugs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — How to curb and counter China’s influence and power —
through its biotech companies, drones and electric vehicles — will
dominate the U.S. House’s first week back from summer break, with
lawmakers taking up a series of measures targeting Beijing.</p>
<p>Washington views Beijing as its biggest geopolitical rival, and the
legislation is touted as ensuring the U.S. prevails in the competition.
Many of the bills scheduled for a vote this week appear to have both
Republican and Democratic support, reflecting strong consensus that
congressional actions are needed to counter China.</p>
<p>The legislation “will take meaningful steps to counter the military,
economic and ideological threat of the Chinese Communist Party,” said
Rep. John Moolenaar, chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese
Communist Party and a Michigan Republican. “There’s a bipartisan goal to
win this competition.”</p>
<p>Advocacy groups worry about the impact, warning against rhetoric that
hurts Asian Americans and could create “an atmosphere of guilt by
association or fuel divisiveness,” said Christine Chen, executive
director of Asian &amp; Pacific Islander American Vote.</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington called the legislation “new
McCarthyism” that hypes the tensions in an election year. If passed, the
bills “will cause serious interference to China-U.S. relations and
mutually beneficial cooperation, and will inevitably damage the U.S.’s
own interests, image and credibility,” spokesman Liu Pengyu said in a
statement.</p>
<p>Among the bills are efforts to reduce U.S. reliance on Chinese
biotech companies, ban Chinese EVs and drones, restrict Chinese
nationals from buying farmland, toughen export restrictions and revive a
program to root out spying on U.S. intellectual property.</p>
<p>If approved, the measures would still need to clear the Senate.
Here’s a look at the key legislation:</p>
<p>Targeting Beijing-linked biotech</p>
<p>A bill seeks to ban a group of five biotechnology companies with
Chinese ties from working with anyone that receives federal money.</p>
<p>The companies include those that work to help doctors detect genetic
causes for cancer or do research and manufacturing for American
drugmakers, considered a key step in developing new medications.</p>
<p>America’s biotech companies have said the bill would disrupt their
partnerships with Chinese contractors, resulting in delays in clinical
trials for new drugs and higher costs.</p>
<p>Supporters say the legislation is necessary to protect U.S. health
care data and reduce the country’s reliance on China for its medical
supply chain.</p>
<p>“American patients cannot be in a position where we rely on China for
genomic testing or basic medical supplies,” said Rep. Brad Wenstrup, an
Ohio Republican who sponsored the bill. He called it “the first step” in
protecting Americans’ genetic data.</p>
<p>BGI, one of the Chinese companies named in the bill, called it “a
false flag targeting companies under the premise of national security.”
The company, which offers genetic sequencing for research purposes in
the U.S., said it follows the law and has no access to Americans’
personal data.</p>
<p>Banning Chinese drones</p>
<p>Another bill would dub drones made by the Chinese company DJI, which
dominates the global drone market, “an unacceptable risk to U.S.
national security” and cut its products from U.S. communications
networks over data security concerns.</p>
<p>The bill would protect Americans’ data and critical infrastructure,
said Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, who introduced it.
“Congress must use every tool at our disposal to stop” China’s
“monopolistic control over the drone market,” she said.</p>
<p>DJI argues that users have to “opt in” to share data such as flight
logs, photos and videos with the company. If users don’t do so, the
company said it won’t have data to share with any government when
compelled. It also has rejected allegations that it is a Chinese
military company and has aided the persecution of members of ethnic
Muslim minorities.</p>
<p>Adam Bry, co-founder and CEO of major U.S. drone maker Skydio, told a
congressional committee in June about losing business to China, where
“the Chinese government has tried to control the drone industry, pouring
resources into national champions and taking aim at competitors in the
U.S. and the West, tilting the playing field in China’s favor.”</p>
<p>Protecting intellectual property</p>
<p>A challenge is likely against an attempt to revive a Trump-era
program described as a way to stop Chinese efforts to steal intellectual
property and spy on industry and research.</p>
<p>The bill would direct the Justice Department to curb spying by
Beijing on U.S. intellectual property and academic institutions and go
after people engaged in theft of trade secrets, hacking and economic
espionage.</p>
<p>The Trump-era program, called the China Initiative, ended in 2022
after multiple unsuccessful prosecutions of researchers and concerns
that it had prompted racial and ethnic profiling. Critics also say it
chilled cooperation between the U.S. and China in science and technology
meant to benefit the greater good.</p>
<p>“Our colleagues in the Republican Party sought to reinstate this
failed program because they wanted to look like they were solving
problems. But in reality, they were only stoking fear and hatred,”
several Democratic lawmakers said in a statement in March, when they
fought off another effort to restart the program.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Restricting farm sales</p>
<p>Another bill, which says it will protect U.S. farmland from foreign
adversaries, has raised concerns about discrimination.</p>
<p>It would add the agriculture secretary to the U.S. Committee on
Foreign Investment, which reviews the national security implications of
foreign transactions. The bill also flags as “reportable” land sales
involving citizens from China, North Korea, Russia and Iran.</p>
<p>“Food security is national security, and for too long, the federal
government has allowed the Chinese Communist Party to put our security
at risk by turning a blind eye to their steadily increasing purchases of
American farmland,” said Rep. Dan Newhouse, a Republican from Washington
state, who introduced the bill.</p>
<p>The National Agricultural Law Center estimates 24 states ban or limit
foreigners without residency and foreign businesses or governments from
owning private farmland. The interest emerged after a Chinese
billionaire bought more than 130,000 acres near a U.S. Air Force base in
Texas and another Chinese company sought to build a corn plant near an
Air Force base in North Dakota.</p>

id="republicans-fault-biden-administration-in-new-report-about-afghanistan-withdrawal">Republicans
fault Biden administration in new report about Afghanistan
withdrawal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Republicans on a U.S. House of Representatives committee
issued a report Sunday criticizing the Biden administration for the
chaotic August 2021 U.S. military and diplomatic withdrawal from
Afghanistan after a nearly 20-year war.</p>
<p>The report faulted President Joe Biden for failing to “mitigate the
likely consequences of the decision” to withdraw, while ignoring
warnings that Taliban fighters were seizing key cities in Afghanistan
faster than U.S. officials expected. </p>
<p>In the last days of the withdrawal, a suicide bombing attack by an
Islamic State terrorist killed 13 U.S. soldiers and about 170 Afghan
civilians at the Kabul airport. Many Afghans clinging to the
underbellies of departing aircraft leaving Afghanistan fell to their
deaths.  </p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump initiated the withdrawal process in
February 2020 by signing an agreement with the Taliban, a pact that
Biden honored as he looked to end America’s longest war.</p>
<p>The fateful withdrawal also played a role in Biden’s political
fortunes. Until that time, Americans in national surveys approved of
Biden’s performance during the first seven months of his presidency.</p>
<p>But his approval rating dipped into negative territory after the
chaotic troop withdrawal and the deaths of the 13 soldiers and has never
again advanced into a favorable standing.  </p>
<p>The report from Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee
followed a three-year investigation and includes accusations that the
Biden administration did not have adequate plans or security in place to
safely carry out the withdrawal.  </p>
<p>Committee Chairman Michael McCaul said the Biden administration “had
the information and opportunity to take necessary steps to plan for the
inevitable collapse of the Afghan government, so we could safely
evacuate U.S. personnel, American citizens, green card holders, and our
brave Afghan allies.”   </p>
<p>Previous investigations have faulted multiple U.S. administrations,
including a 2023 report by the U.S. government watchdog for the U.S. in
Afghanistan which cited both Trump’s and Biden’s determination to go
forward with the withdrawal despite the Taliban breaking key commitments
the militants made in the 2020 agreement.   </p>
<p>Congressman Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the committee, said in
a letter to colleagues that Republicans “cherry-picked witness testimony
to exclude anything unhelpful to a predetermined, partisan narrative
about the Afghanistan withdrawal.”  </p>
<p>In a lengthy statement, the U.S. State Department said, “There are
valid and important criticisms of the two-decade-long war in Afghanistan
and how it concluded.” But the country’s top diplomatic agency said it
“has remained focused on evolving and growing from this moment, learning
important lessons and making sustainable changes to crisis
operations.”</p>
<p>The State Department said the U.S. government successfully evacuated
120,000 Americans, Afghans, and third-country nationals from Afghanistan
in the final two weeks of August 2021 and has resettled 165,000 Afghans
across the U.S.</p>
<p>The State Department said it “stands ready to work alongside”
lawmakers who have a “serious interest” in finding legislative and
administrative solutions to avoid the chaos of the withdrawal from the
Afghan war zone. But the State  Department said it would “not stand by
silently” as the agency and “its workforce are used to further partisan
agendas.” </p>

Agence France-Presse and Reuters.</p>

<h2 id="risc-laptops-of-the-90s-and-early-2000s">RISC Laptops of the 90s
and early 2000s</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Paul Weissmann’s OpenPA, the invaluable archive on anything related
to the HP’s PA-RISC architecture, devices, and operating systems, has
branched off for a bit and started collecting information on RISC
laptops. Technical computing in the 1990s was mostly done on RISC
workstations with Unix operating systems and specialized applications.
For mobile use cases, some of the popular RISC vendors built RISC
Laptops for mobile Unix use in the 1990s. Often based on contemporary
Unix workstations, these RISC laptops were often marketed for government
and military uses such as command, technical analysis and surveillance.
↫ Paul Weissmann at OpenPA OpenPA has always had content beyond just
PA-RISC (like HP’s Itanium machines), so this is not entirely
surprising, and it also happens to be something that’s sorely needed –
there’s remarkably little consolidated information to be found on these
RISC laptops, and it’s usually scattered all over the place and
difficult to find. They were expensive and rare when they were new, and
they’re even rarer and often more expensive today. What we’re talking
about here are laptops with PA-RISC, SPARC, (non-Apple) PowerPC, and
Alpha processors, running some variant of UNIX, like HP-UX,
SunOS/Solaris, AIX, and even Windows NT. A particularly interesting
listing at the moment is the Hitachi 3050RX/100C, a laptop based on the
Hitachi PA/50L PA-RISC processor that ran something called HI-UX/WE2, a
UNIX from Hitachi I can’t find much information about. The most
desirable laptop listed is the amazing Tadpole Viper, which was the most
powerful SPARC laptop Tadpole ever made, and I’m pretty sure it’s the
most powerful SPARC laptop, period. It was powered by a 1.2Ghz
UltraSPARC IIIi processor, and was also sold as the Sun Ultra 3, in
2005. I would perform some seriously questionable acts to get my hands
on one of these, but they’re most likely virtually impossible to find.
Anyone who can help Weissmann find more information – feel free to do
so.</p>

id="tropical-system-to-drench-parts-of-us-gulf-coast-may-strengthen">Tropical
system to drench parts of US Gulf Coast, may strengthen</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Houston, Texas — A tropical disturbance in the southwestern Gulf of
Mexico was forecast to bring significant rainfall to parts of Texas and
Louisiana this week and was expected to develop into a tropical storm
and possibly even a hurricane, the National Weather Service says.</p>
<p>The system was forecast to drift slowly northwestward during the next
couple of days, moving near and along the Gulf coasts of Mexico and
Texas, the weather service said Sunday.</p>
<p>“A tropical storm is expected to form during the next day or so,” the
weather service said Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>Donald Jones, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in
Lake Charles, Louisiana, said during a weather briefing Saturday night
that parts of Southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana should expect a
“whole lot” of rain in the middle and later part of this week.</p>
<p>“Definitely want to continue to keep a very close eye on the forecast
here in the coming days because this is something that could develop and
evolve fairly rapidly. We’re looking at anything from a non-named just
tropical moisture air mass all the way up to the potential for a
hurricane,” Jones said.</p>
<p>Warm water temperatures and other conditions in the Gulf of Mexico
are favorable for storm development, Jones said.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen it before, where we have these rapid spin-up hurricanes
in just a couple of days or even less. So that is not out of the realm
of possibility here,” Jones said.</p>
<p>An Air Force Reserve hurricane hunter aircraft was scheduled to
investigate the tropical disturbance later Sunday and gather more
data.</p>
<p>The tropical disturbance comes after an unusually quiet August and
early September in the current Atlantic hurricane season, which runs
through Nov. 30. The season was set to peak Tuesday, Jones said.</p>
<p>So far, there have been five named storms this hurricane season,
including Hurricane Beryl, which knocked out power to nearly 3 million
homes and businesses in Texas — mostly in the Houston area — in July.
Experts had predicted one of the busiest Atlantic hurricane seasons on
record.</p>
<p>In a report issued last week, researchers at Colorado State
University cited several reasons for the lull in activity during the
current hurricane season, including extremely warm upper-level
temperatures resulting in stabilization of the atmosphere and too much
easterly wind shear in the eastern Atlantic.</p>
<p>“We still do anticipate an above-normal season overall, however,
given that large-scale conditions appear to become more favorable around
the middle of September,” according to the report.</p>
<p>Last month, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
updated its outlook but still predicted a highly active Atlantic
hurricane season. Forecasters tweaked the number of expected named
storms from 17 to 25 to 17 to 24.</p>

id="sinner-of-italy-sweeps-us-open-title-for-second-grand-slam-triumph">Sinner,
of Italy, sweeps US Open title for second Grand Slam triumph</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Jannik Sinner beat Taylor Fritz 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 with a
relentless baseline game to win the U.S. Open men’s championship on
Sunday, less than three weeks after being exonerated in a doping
case.</p>
<p>The No. 1-ranked Sinner, a 23-year-old from Italy, won the second
Grand Slam trophy of his nascent career — the other was at the
Australian Open in January — and prevented No. 12 Fritz from ending a
major title drought for American men that has lasted 21 years.</p>
<p>Andy Roddick’s triumph at Flushing Meadows in 2003 was the last Slam
title for a man from the United States. The last before Fritz, a
26-year-old from California, to even contest a final at one of the four
biggest tournaments in tennis also was Roddick, who lost to Roger
Federer at Wimbledon in 2009.</p>
<p>Sinner extended his current winning streak to 11 matches and improved
to 55-5 with a tour-high six titles in 2024. That includes a 35-2 mark
on hard courts, the surface used at both the Australian Open and U.S.
Open, and he is the first man since Guillermo Vilas in 1977 to win his
first two Grand Slam trophies in the same season, something such greats
as Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Federer never accomplished.</p>
<p>Less than a week before competition began at Flushing Meadows, the
world found out that Sinner had tested positive twice for anabolic
steroids in March but was cleared because his use was ruled
unintentional — the banned substance entered his system via a massage
from a team member he later fired.</p>
<p>As expected, Fritz enjoyed something of a home-court advantage on a
cool afternoon under a nearly cloudless sky. In a celebrity-filled crowd
that included Taylor Swift and her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs tight
end Travis Kelce, some spectators occasionally engaged in chants of
“U-S-A!” between games or rose to their feet whenever he managed to pick
up what felt in the moment like a crucial point.</p>
<p>Fritz is not the sort to show much in the way of emotion, often
greeting those instances with a little shake of his neon-colored racket.
When he was broken in the match’s first game, an inauspicious start that
included a bad miss of a smash, Fritz grinned sarcastically.</p>
<p>Sinner showed some jitters, too, and when he played a loose game that
included a double-fault and other misses, that helped Fritz break back
to eventually lead 3-2 after 20 minutes.</p>
<p>That was pretty much the last significant highlight for Fritz or his
fans until 3-all in the third set, when he smacked an overhead winner to
get to 15-30, punched the air and screamed, “Let’s go!” People in the
stands rose, applauding and shouting. After Fritz deposited a volley
winner to earn a break point a minute later, he celebrated in the same
fashion, and thousands around him went wild. Sinner then double-faulted,
putting Fritz in front 4-3.</p>
<p>But when he tried to serve out the set at 5-4, Fritz buckled enough
to let Sinner pull even by breaking. Sinner used a drop shot to lure
Fritz to the front court, then slid a passing shot that Fritz volleyed
into the net. Fritz bounced off his racket off the court. Sinner loped
to the towel box, not even smiling.</p>
<p>About 10 minutes later, the victory was Sinner’s thanks to a closing
four-game run. When it was over, Sinner raised his arms, threw his head
back and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>He generally asserts himself during matches in what perhaps is best
described as a rather casual way. His style is less spectacular than
solid, less magical than metronomic. Either way, it was masterful, using
his long limbs and squeaking, sliding sneakers to get to everything
before aiming high-speed shot after shot right near lines — and usually
succeeding.</p>
<p>Neither player seemed all that interested in venturing forward Sunday
unless forced to, instead content to ply their forehands and backhands
from the back of the court.</p>
<p>That’s decidedly Sinner’s territory.</p>
<p>By the end, Sinner, the second Italian to win a singles title at the
U.S. Open, joining 2015 women’s champion Flavia Pennetta, had an
impressive ledger: just 21 unforced errors, 13 fewer than Fritz, and 23
winners.</p>
<p>Going in, the matchup appeared to be one Fritz would only have a
chance of keeping competitive provided he demonstrated his absolute
best, particularly when serving. If that’s so, the opening set turned
out to be something less than an ideal for him.</p>
<p>He put 36% of his first serves in, delivered only two aces — a total
exceeded in the initial game of the second set alone — and wound up with
more than twice as many unforced errors (12) as winners (five).</p>
<p>Those sorts of stats would improve from Fritz’s side, but he did not
figure out a way to consistently put Sinner in trouble. Few can these
days.</p>

id="for-many-leaving-china-its-japan-not-the-us-thats-the-bigger-draw">For
many leaving China, it’s Japan — not the US — that’s the bigger
draw</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TOKYO — One by one, the students, lawyers and others filed into a
classroom in a central Tokyo university for a lecture by a Chinese
journalist on Taiwan and democracy — taboo topics that can’t be
discussed publicly back home in China.</p>
<p>“Taiwan’s modern-day democracy took struggle and bloodshed, there’s
no question about that,” said Jia Jia, a columnist and guest lecturer at
the University of Tokyo who was briefly detained in China eight years
ago on suspicion of penning a call for China’s top leader to resign.</p>
<p>He is one of tens of thousands of intellectuals, investors and other
Chinese who have relocated to Japan in recent years, part of a larger
exodus of people from China.</p>
<p>Their backgrounds vary widely, and they’re leaving for all sorts of
reasons. Some are very poor, others are very rich. Some leave for
economic reasons, as opportunities dry up with the end of China’s boom.
Some flee for personal reasons, as even limited freedoms are eroded.</p>
<p>Chinese migrants are flowing to all corners of the world, from
workers seeking to start businesses of their own in Mexico to burned-out
students heading to Thailand. Those choosing Japan tend to be well-off
or highly educated, drawn to the country’s ease of living, rich culture
and immigration policies that favor highly skilled professionals, with
less of the sharp anti-immigrant backlash sometimes seen in Western
countries.</p>
<p>Jia initially intended to move to the U.S., not Japan. But after
experiencing the coronavirus outbreak in China, he was anxious to leave
and his American visa application was stuck in processing. So he chose
Japan instead.</p>
<p>“In the United States, illegal immigration is particularly
controversial. When I went to Japan, I was a little surprised. I found
that their immigration policy is actually more relaxed than I thought,”
Jia told The Associated Press. “I found that Japan is better than the
U.S.”</p>
<p>It’s tough to enter the U.S. these days. Tens of thousands of Chinese
were arrested at the U.S.-Mexico border over the past year, and Chinese
students have been grilled at customs as trade frictions fan suspicions
of possible industrial espionage. Some U.S. states passed legislation
that restricts Chinese citizens from owning property.</p>
<p>“The U.S. is shutting out those Chinese that are friendliest to them,
that most share its values,” said Li Jinxing, a Christian human rights
lawyer who moved to Japan in 2022.</p>
<p>Li sees parallels to about a century ago, when Chinese intellectuals
such as Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of modern China, moved to Japan
to study how the country modernized so quickly.</p>
<p>“On one hand, we hope to find inspiration and direction in history,”
Li said of himself and like-minded Chinese in Japan. “On the other hand,
we also want to observe what a democratic country with rule of law is
like. We’re studying Japan. How does its economy work, its government
work?”</p>
<p>Over the past decade, Tokyo has softened its once-rigid stance
against immigration, driven by low birthrates and an aging population.
Foreigners now make up about 2% of its population of 125 million. That’s
expected to jump to 12% by 2070, according to the Tokyo-based National
Institute of Population and Social Security Research.</p>
<p>Chinese are the most numerous newcomers, at 822,000 last year among
more than 3 million foreigners living in Japan, according to government
data. That’s up from 762,000 a year ago and 649,000 a decade ago.</p>
<p>In 2022, the lockdowns under China’s “zero COVID” policies led many
of the country’s youth or most affluent citizens to hit the exits.
There’s even a buzzword for that: “runxue,” using the English word “run”
to evoke “running away” to places seen as safer and more prosperous.</p>
<p>For intellectuals like Li and Jia, Japan offers greater freedoms than
under Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s increasingly repressive rule. But for
others, such as wealthy investors and business people, Japan offers
something else: property protections.</p>
<p>A report by investment migration firm Henley &amp; Partners says
nearly 14,000 millionaires left China last year, the most of any country
in the world, with Japan a popular destination. A major driver is
worries about the security of their wealth in China or Hong Kong, said
Q. Edward Wang, a professor of Asian studies at Rowan University in
Glassboro, New Jersey.</p>
<p>“Protection of private property, which is the cornerstone of a
capitalist society, that piece is missing in China,” Wang said.</p>
<p>The weakening yen makes buying property and other local assets in
Japan a bargain.</p>
<p>And while the Japanese economy has stagnated, China’s once-sizzling
economy is also in a rut, with the property sector in crisis and stock
prices stuck at the level they were in the late 2000s.</p>
<p>“If you are just going to Japan to preserve your money,” Wang said,
“then definitely you will enjoy your time in Japan.”</p>
<p>Dot.com entrepreneurs are among those leaving China after Communist
Party crackdowns on the technology industry, including billionaire Jack
Ma, a founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba, who took a professorship at
Tokyo College, part of the prestigious University of Tokyo.</p>
<p>So many wealthy Chinese have bought apartments in Tokyo’s luxury
high-rises that some areas have been dubbed “Chinatowns,” or “Digital
Chinatowns” — a nod to the many owners’ work in high-tech
industries.</p>
<p>“Life in Japan is good,” said Guo Yu, an engineer who retired early
after working at ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok.</p>
<p>Guo doesn’t concern himself with politics. He’s keen on Japan’s
powdery snow in the winter and is a “superfan” of its beautiful hot
springs. He owns homes in Tokyo, as well as near a ski resort and a hot
spring. He owns several cars, including a Porsche, a Mercedes, a Tesla
and a Toyota.</p>
<p>Guo keeps busy with a new social media startup in Tokyo and a travel
agency specializing in “onsen,” Japan’s hot springs. Most of his
employees are Chinese, he said.</p>
<p>Like Guo, many Chinese moving to Japan are wealthy and educated.
That’s for good reason: Japan remains unwelcoming to refugees and many
other types of foreigners. The government has been strategic about who
it allows to stay, generally focusing on people to fill labor shortages
for factories, construction and elder care.</p>
<p>“It is crucial that Japan becomes an attractive country for foreign
talent so they will choose to work here,” Japanese Prime Minister Fumio
Kishida said earlier this year, announcing efforts to relax Japan’s
stringent immigration restrictions.</p>
<p>That kind of opportunity is exactly what Chinese ballet dancer Du Hai
said he has found. Leading a class of a dozen Japanese students in a
suburban Tokyo studio one recent weekend, Du demonstrated positions and
spins to the women dressed in leotards and toe shoes.</p>
<p>Du was drawn to Japan’s huge ballet scene, filled with professional
troupes and talented dancers, he said, but worried about warnings he got
about unfriendly Japanese.</p>
<p>That turned out to be false, he said with a laugh. Now, Du is
considering getting Japanese citizenship.</p>
<p>“Of course, I enjoy living in Japan very much now,” he said.</p>

east of LA threatens thousands of homes and forces evacuations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. — Thousands of homes and buildings were
threatened Sunday by an out-of-control wildfire burning in the foothills
of a national forest east of Los Angeles, amid a days-long heat wave
that pushed temperatures into the triple digits across the region.</p>
<p>State firefighters said 8,733 structures were threatened, including
single and multi-family homes and commercial buildings.</p>
<p>The so-called Line Fire was burning along the edge of the San
Bernardino National Forest, about 105 kilometers east of LA. As of
Sunday morning, the blaze had charred about 70 square kilometers of
grass and chaparral, leaving a thick cloud of dark smoke blanketing the
area.</p>
<p>County officials declared an emergency Saturday evening.</p>
<p>“Extreme temperatures, wind and lightning strikes have allowed the
fire to grow rapidly,” the county said in a statement.</p>
<p>More firefighters were expected to arrive Sunday. State officials
said vegetation is critically dry in the area and temperatures reached
more than 38 degrees Celsius on Saturday with relative humidity dipping
to provide ideal conditions for fire growth.</p>
<p>The fire began Thursday evening, and the cause is under
investigation. </p>
<p>About 500 firefighters were battling the blaze, supported by
water-dropping helicopters that hovered over homes and hillsides, along
with aircraft.</p>
<p>The fire produced coiling clouds of dense smoke, and flames could be
seen cresting hillside ridges.</p>
<p>No injuries were reported, and no homes or other structures had been
damaged or destroyed.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service said downtown Los Angeles hit a high of
44 degrees Celsius Friday, which marked the third time since 1877 that a
temperature that high has been reached there.</p>

Intel scraps 20A node, AMD Z2 Extreme chip for handhelds is coming next
year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-08, from: Liliputing</p>
<p>
Intel’s next chips will likely be most likely be built by TMSC. AMD is
teasing plans for a next-gen chip for handheld gaming PCs. There’s a new
Linux laptop on the market (that looks a lot like the previous-gen
version of the same laptop). And Spec5’s new NOMAD handheld device is a
Raspberry Pi 5-powered […]

Up until a few years ago I didn’t find myself writing about laptops with
screen sizes large than 13 or 14 inches very often, because the whole
point of creating a website called Liliputing was to focus on
Lilliputian (little) computers. But a growing number of PC makers have
been cramming big displays and high-performance […]

Sabalenka defeats America’s Pegula to win US Open women’s title</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka beat American sixth seed
Jessica Pegula 7-5, 7-5 in the U.S. Open women’s final on Saturday.</p>
<p>Sabalenka blocked out the wild cheers of the home crowd in Arthur
Ashe Stadium to break Pegula in the final game and win her first title
at Flushing Meadows.</p>
<p>A year after coming up short in the final, the second seed fought
back from a break down in both sets to claim victory and fell to the
court in her moment of triumph.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old Pegula had waited a long time to reach her first
major final but could not match her opponent’s raw power despite the
noisy backing of the New York crowd.</p>
<p>The roof on Arthur Ashe Stadium was closed because of heavy rain, and
the players traded breaks twice as they settled into the stormy affair
in front of a celebrity-packed house.</p>
<p>Sabalenka held her serve through a four-deuce 11th game and fought
through a spine-tingling 12th, mixing precision at the net with her
usual power from the baseline before breaking her opponent on the fifth
set point.</p>
<p>Pegula struggled with her rackets throughout the match, complaining
to her coaches as she seemed unable to find the right tension on her
strings, and it looked as though she would not put up a fight in the
second set when Sabalenka went 3-0 up.</p>
<p>But the American found another level and brought the fans to their
feet when she won the next five games in a furious fight back.</p>
<p>Sabalenka leveled when she sent over a forehand winner that just
kissed the line on break point in the 10th game and sought to bring a
swift end to the contest, holding serve and then applying pressure from
the baseline in the final game.</p>
<p>The tears flowed immediately for Sabalenka as she claimed her third
Grand Slam title after winning the Australian Open twice, and she
high-fived fans as she ran up the stands to share a joyful celebration
with her team.</p>
