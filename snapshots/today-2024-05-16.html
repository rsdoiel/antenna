To that end, he’s running a poll on whether the choice for the language

for example, should Swedish be identified as that, making it obvious for
English speakers, or should it be Svenska, to make it clearer to Swedish

<p>
I’ve been riding <a href="https://go.ride1up.com/SH2z">Ride1Up
e-bikes</a> since just about their first model. Over the many years
since I first threw a leg over that bike, I’ve watched the company roll
out
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/03/20/ride1up-cf-racer1-review-e-bike/">an
ever-increasing lineup</a> of diverse e-bikes that all shared one common
trend: great bang for your buck.

So when I was

touring Asia</a> to visit micromobility factories for a peek behind the
curtain, I knew Ride1Up’s factory would be high on my list. They invited
me out to join the company’s founder, Kevin Dugger, on a tour of the
factory so I could see just how Ride1Up goes about ensuring they can
keep the quality high and the prices low.

in place, US military says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PENTAGON — The U.S. military says a temporary pier is now anchored to
the shore of Gaza, the final step in completing a sea route to
distribute aid to 2 million Gazans affected by the Israel-Hamas war.</p>
<p>“This morning, just a few hours ago, the pier was successfully
affixed to the beach in Gaza. In the coming days, we will commence the
delivery of aid,” U.S. Vice Admiral Brad Cooper told reporters
Thursday.</p>
<p>Cooper said about 500 tons of humanitarian assistance have been
loaded onto ships, with thousands of tons more ready to be added to the
distribution queue once that aid is distributed.</p>
<p>“We are focused on flooding the zone with humanitarian assistance …
to complement the provision of aid through land routes, which we know is
the most efficient and effective pathway to move the necessary volume of
assistance,” he said.</p>
<p>The new maritime corridor has several parts, with aid first
undergoing inspection and security checks in Cyprus. Loads are then
being taken to a U.S.-built floating platform off the Gaza coast and
transferred onto trucks, with smaller boats taking the trucks to the
newly anchored pier that juts out several hundred meters from the Gaza
coastline.</p>

<p>Each boat can transfer between five and 15 trucks to shore. Once
fully operational, the pier will be able to provide about 150 truckloads
of aid to Gaza per day, according to U.S. officials.</p>
<p>The United Nations will receive shipments and coordinate distribution
on the ground for the Gazans. The arrangement is part of an effort to
boost what humanitarian organizations say is a vastly insufficient
amount of aid for Palestinian civilians. </p>
<p>“The American corridor is absolutely essential to helping meet this
gap in need to address the shelter, the food, the health, malnutrition
and clean water sanitation needs,” said Sonali Korde, assistant to the
administrator of USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance.</p>
<p>Some aid groups have said the maritime corridor is not the best
solution, arguing that increasing the flow of aid through land crossings
would be far more effective.</p>
<p>“We need to just continue to work on getting more aid in through all
routes,” Korde said. “We’re at a point in time when this is all hands on
deck. We can’t spare any effort.”</p>
<p>Aid has been slow to get into Gaza due to long backups of vehicles at
Israeli inspection points. The United States and other nations have air
dropped food into Gaza 38 times in recent months, but each air drop via
military accounts for only about one to three truckloads of food, a U.S.
official told VOA.</p>
<p>Aid organizations have said several hundred truckloads of food are
needed in Gaza each day.</p>
<p>The pier’s completion was delayed for several days due to rough
seas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Security</p>
<p>Security for the approximately 1,000 U.S. forces building the pier
and aid organizations distributing the supplies has been the paramount
concern for the Pentagon since the plan’s conception, according to
Cooper.</p>
<p>“This is a 100% humanitarian mission, and any attack on those working
on it is an attack on aid for the people of Gaza,” said Cooper.</p>
<p>Security forces have conducted rehearsals in preparation for the
commencement of operations and will continue to assess and reassess
security, Cooper said.</p>
<p>Israel Defense Forces have dedicated a brigade of troops, along with
ships and air assets, to help ensure force protection. IDF engineers
prepared the beach for the temporary pier and secured it to the
beach.</p>
<p>Israel attacked Hamas in Gaza following Hamas’ October 7 terror
attack on Israel, which killed 1,200 people and saw hundreds more taken
hostage.</p>
<p>In the nearly seven months since the attack, more than 34,000
Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to Gazan health
officials.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
At a triumphant bill-signing earlier this month, Florida Gov. Ron
DeSantis sounded less like the leader of the nation’s third largest
state and more like the host of a QAnon podcast. “Today, Florida is
fighting back against the global elite’s plan to force the world to eat
meat grown in a petri dish or bugs to achieve their authoritarian
goals,”
<a href="https://www.flgov.com/2024/05/01/governor-desantis-signs-legislation-to-keep-lab-grown-meat-out-of-florida/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he
said</u></a>. DeSantis was there to trumpet a new state law that outlaws
the sale of lab-grown meat, also known as
<a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/lab-grown-meat-florida-desantis" target="_self"><u>cultivated
meat</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
One might reasonably ask why DeSantis and his Republican allies care
about lab-grown meat at all. The technology — in which cells from
animals are fed with nutrients and grown until they eventually produce
something resembling a cut of actual meat — is still in the experimental
stage, and it could be decades before companies are able to produce it
on an industrial scale, if ever. So why bother outlawing it?
</p>
<p>
But DeSantis is not alone. Legislators in Alabama, apparently satisfied
that they have solved all the state’s other problems, rushed to pass a
similar law, which Gov. Kay Ivey
<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/13/lab-grown-meat-ban-alabama/73678952007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>signed</u></a>
on May 7. Similar measures have also been introduced in Arizona,
Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia. And it isn’t just Republicans; a
few Democrats looking to fortify their carnivorous bona fides have also
attacked cultivated meat. Pennsylvania’s Democratic Senator John
Fetterman
<a href="https://twitter.com/SenFettermanPA/status/1786064644383142187" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>applauded</u></a>
DeSantis’ action, saying he “would never serve that slop to my kids,”
and Montana Democrat Sen. Jon Tester — who
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIvbGBIJHa4&t=5s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lost
three fingers</u></a> in a meat grinder as a boy —
<a href="https://www.tester.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tester-champions-montanas-ranchers-introduces-bipartisan-bill-to-ban-schools-from-serving-lab-grown-meat/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>introduced
a bill</u></a> to ban cultivated meat from school lunches.
</p>
<p>
So far, Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president,
has not weighed in on lab-grown meat. But given his taste for outré
conspiracy theories and niche culture war issues, no one would be
surprised if he began railing against it in his rallies and on Truth
Social.
</p>
<p>
This is fundamentally a fake issue: Not only is there no place you can
buy lab-grown meat in Florida or Alabama, there’s no place you can buy
it anywhere in the country. Last year the Department of Agriculture
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/us-approves-chicken-made-cultivated-cells-nations-first-lab-grown-meat-rcna90439" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gave
approval</u></a> for lab-grown chicken to be sold, and not long after it
was featured as a special menu item at the upscale restaurants Bar Crenn
in San Francisco and José Andrés’ China Chilcano in Washington (reviews
were mixed but
<a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23801730/cell-cultivated-lab-grown-meat-jose-andres-upside-eat-just" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mostly
positive</u></a>). But those experiments have
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/upside-foods-good-meat-cultivated-lab-grown-sale-stopped-singapore-california-crenn/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ended</u></a>,
and it could be a while before it’s available again even in a
restaurant. The technological challenges in recreating both the taste
and texture of meat have proven greater than many anticipated; the
problem may not be insurmountable, but it hasn’t been surmounted yet, at
least not at scale.
</p>
<p>
But it’s just the kind of issue Republicans (and Democrats in swing
states) love, one that casts them as the defenders of the honest,
traditional, and manly, while mainstream Democrats are supposedly the
advocates of weird and vaguely effeminate ideas. Why would you let some
egghead scientist make you a steak? Real men want to know that their
meat was killed in the most unpleasant circumstances possible.
</p>
<p>
Then there’s the climate angle: While Republicans may not exactly be
pro-climate change in their rhetoric (policy choices are another
matter), they are eagerly anti-anti-climate change, in the same way
they’re anti-anti-racism. Just as they wage the culture war by opposing
efforts to undo racism, they can do the same by opposing efforts to
address climate change, shifting the conversation from the real problem
onto the supposedly oppressive efforts to solve it.
</p>
<p>
And solving climate change is one of the rationales for cultivated meat
that has helped attract venture capital to the startups trying to make
it a reality. Global demand for meat has
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>risen
steadily</u></a> for decades, and will
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00322-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>continue
to grow</u></a> as incomes increase (generally speaking, the wealthier a
country is, the more meat its citizens consume). In 2022, humans
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/animals-slaughtered-for-meat" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>slaughtered</u></a>
300 million cows, 1.5 billion pigs, and an incredible 75 billion
chickens. Advocates of lab-grown meat sell it as a way to mitigate both
that almost unfathomable carnage, with all its attendant animal
suffering, and the enormous climate effects of meat production.
</p>
<p>
And unlike plant-based meat substitutes, lab-grown meat would satisfy
the human desire to consume genuine animal flesh. There’s almost
certainly a limit on how many people will want to eat Impossible Burgers
and “Chick-n” tenders, no matter how good they taste. But since
cultivated meat is still meat, advocates say any carnivore should be
happy to bite into a lab-grown steak — which is why it’s so important
for certain politicians to convince them that doing so would make them
some kind of hippie.
</p>
<p>
I’d submit that politicians like DeSantis don’t actually care whether
anyone sells or eats a cultivated pork loin. The point is to convince
people that they are under siege from the powerful forces of wokeness,
who want to steal your gustatory freedom after they confiscate your guns
and force your children to change genders.
</p>
<p>
The invocation of bug-eating is a key tell. When DeSantis tells people
that “the global elite” wants to force you to eat bugs, he’s referencing
a conspiracy theory that the average person may not have heard of but is
widespread on the right. Bill Gates and other leftist puppetmasters,
<a href="https://sentientmedia.org/bill-gates-bug-eating-conspiracy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
theory goes</u></a>, have a plan to enslave us all and force us to eat
bugs for our protein.
</p>
<p>
One of the benefits of associating bug-eating with a different food you
want to discredit is that it produces feelings of disgust, which social
psychologists have long known are
<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn26481-left-or-right-wing-brains-disgust-response-tells-all/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
powerful</u></a> for conservatives than for liberals. As Tucker Carlson
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/31/1167550482/how-a-conspiracy-theory-about-eating-bugs-made-its-way-to-international-politics" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>once
said</u></a>, “Eating insects is repulsive and un-American. And of
course, therefore, in the eyes of the left, it must be awesome.”
</p>
<p>
Here’s the counterpoint, thought: One might also think that this is an
issue of basic liberty. Cultivated meat might or might not become widely
consumed as an alternate food source, but if it does, as long as it’s
safe you should be able to eat it if you want to (and the same ought to
go for bugs). We can say with a fair bit of confidence that there will
still be old-fashioned lamb chops and roast chickens available for all
of our lifetimes.

But as an opportunity to create another front in the culture war and
remind voters that politics is all about identity, it’s too good for
Republicans in Florida and Alabama, and maybe other states to come, to
pass up. If there’s a woke hippie conspiracy afoot to rob you of your
testosterone and make you slave to the global elite, they want voters to
know they’ll be on it. Even if it’s imaginary.

Since the Paris Climate Agreement, banks together have funneled trillion

financier in the world. Some of the other top investors? Citibank, Wells
Fargo and Bank of America. We’ll discuss. Then, the Federal Trade
Commission is trying to crack down on fabricated reviews. Problem is,
fake reviews are a global industry.

House blocks release of Biden’s special counsel interview audio</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden has asserted executive privilege
over audio of his interview with special counsel Robert Hur that’s at
the center a Republican effort to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland
in contempt of Congress, the Justice Department told lawmakers on
Thursday.</p>
<p>It comes as the House Oversight and Accountability Committee and the
Judiciary Committee are each expected to hold a hearing to recommend
that the full House refer Garland to the Justice Department for the
contempt charges over the department’s refusal to hand over the
audio.</p>
<p>Garland advised Biden in a letter on Thursday that the audio falls
within the scope of executive privilege. Garland told the Democratic
president that the “committee’s needs are plainly insufficient to
outweigh the deleterious effects that the production of the recordings
would have on the integrity and effectiveness of similar law enforcement
investigations in the future.”</p>
<p>Assistant Attorney General Carlos Felipe Uriarte urged lawmakers not
to proceed with the contempt effort to avoid “unnecessary and
unwarranted conflict.”</p>
<p>“It is the longstanding position of the executive branch held by
administrations of both parties that an official who asserts the
president’s claim of executive privilege cannot be held in contempt of
Congress,” Uriarte wrote.</p>
<p>White House Counsel Ed Siskel wrote in a separate, scathing letter to
Congress on Thursday that lawmakers’ effort to obtain the recording was
absent any legitimate purpose and lays bare their likely goal — “to chop
them up, distort them, and use them for partisan political
purposes.”</p>
<p>The White House memo is a tacit admission that there are moments from
the interview it fears portray Biden in a negative light in an election
year — and that could be exacerbated by the release, or selective
release, of the audio.</p>
<p>The transcript of the Hur interview showed Biden struggling to recall
some dates and occasionally confusing some details — something longtime
aides says he’s done for years in both public and private — but
otherwise showing deep recall in other areas. Biden and his aides are
particularly sensitive to questions about his age. At 81, he’s the
oldest ever president, and he’s seeking another four year term.</p>
<p>Hur found some evidence that Biden had willfully retained classified
information and disclosed it to a ghostwriter but concluded that it was
insufficient for criminal charges.</p>

feud</a> on the side of the adolescent-but-quickly-maturing domestic
solar manufacturing industry, wrote Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin. Bifacial
modules are estimated to account for over 90% of U.S. module imports.
That amounted to some $4.3 billion of incoming orders in the first six
months of last year. Developers who have contracts to buy bifacial
panels that will be shipped within 90 days will still be able to import
them without duties, and the tariffs also allow a quota of solar cells,
which are later assembled into modules, to be imported without charges.

most headlines, the law does a few other important things, too:

<ul>
<li>
It nixes requirements for state government to prioritize climate change
when writing energy policy.
</li>
<li>
It removes language that gave state officials the authority to set goals
for renewable energy.
</li>
<li>
It bans offshore wind turbines in state waters.

It repeals state grant programs that encourage energy conservation and
renewable energy.

<li>
It deletes requirements for state agencies to use
environmentally-friendly products and fuel-efficient vehicles.

It prevents municipalities from dictating which fuels can be used in
appliances like gas stoves.

It waters down regulation of gas pipelines and boosts expansion of gas.

<h2 id="biden-takes-a-side-in-the-solar-industrys-family-feud">Biden
Takes a Side in the Solar Industry’s Family Feud</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-16, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjI1Mjc4OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0ODcyNzE2NH0.cVJgw0DAHTqNsEQ1_gai31rcKZfChj27Tzz44njgQ_8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
The Biden administration continued its campaign to support domestic
green energy manufacturing via trade policy on Thursday, this time by
expanding existing solar panel tariffs to include the popular two-sided
modules used in many utility-scale solar installations.
</p>
<p>
With this move, the Biden administration is decisively intervening in
the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/solar-tariffs-us-china" target="_self"><u>solar
industry’s raging feud</u></a> on the side of the
adolescent-but-quickly-maturing (thanks, in part, to generous government
support) domestic solar manufacturing industry. On the other side is the
more established solar development, installation, and financing
industry, which tends to support the widespread availability of cheaper
solar components, even if they come from China or Chinese-owned
companies in Southeast Asia.
</p>
<p>
These particular solar modules, known as bifacial modules, are estimated
to account for over 90% of U.S. module imports. That amounted to some
$4.3 billion of incoming orders in the first six months of last year,
according to a report by the International Trade Commission, an almost
three-fold increase from the first six months of the year prior.
</p>
<p>
Tariffs on solar modules were first imposed by the Trump administration
in 2018 and later extended in 2022, with the levy rate falling to around
14% from the initial 30%.
</p>
<p>
Domestic and global solar supply chains are under threat from “unfair
and non-market practices,” as well as “Chinese solar panel
overcapacity,” National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi said on a call with
reporters — hence the expanded tariffs.
</p>
<p>
The solar manufacturing industry and elected representatives in states
that have seen large solar manufacturing investments have been pushing
to end the exclusion. Georgia Senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock,
for instance, wrote a letter to President Biden in March calling for the
bifacial exemption to be removed, arguing that “the elimination of the
exemption for bifacial panels would strengthen the United States’ and
Georgia’s economy, protect U.S. national security, and serve the
nation’s long-term economic and energy security interests.”
</p>
<p>
The Korean solar company Qcells is planning to invest more than
<a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/19/qcells-expands-2-5-billion-us-solar-factory/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$2
billion in solar manufacturing in Georgia</u></a>. The American solar
manufacturer First Solar has
<a href="https://www.firstsolar.com/en/Resources/Blogs/First-Solar-Responds-to-Bifacial-Exemption" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>long
campaigned</u></a> for bifacial modules to be included in the tariffs.
</p>
<p>
White House climate advisor John Podesta cited the International Trade
Commission report during the briefing with reporters to demonstrate that
an increase in bifacial imports had occurred while
<a href="https://www.usitc.gov/publications/other/pub5494.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>imports
of other types of modules had fallen</u></a>. “The findings … made clear
that the bifacial exemption was likely being abused, and that that
tariff exemption was no longer appropriate,” Podesta said.<br/><br/>The
White House is not completely deaf to the preferences of the other side
of the solar industry, however.<br/><br/>Developers who have contracts
to buy bifacial panels that will be shipped within 90 days will still be
able to import them without duties, Podesta said, “to avoid undue
disruptions to the industry.”
</p>
<p>
The tariffs also allow a quota of solar cells, which are later assembled
into modules, to be imported without charges. Zaidi said that “raising …
the tariff rate quota to facilitate the availability of solar cells for
manufacturers here in the United States will be necessary to make sure
we’re sprinting into the acceleration that’s necessary to grow the U.S.
manufacturing capacity.”
</p>
<p>
The solar lobby had been asking for at least an increase in the tariff
rate quota. While they weren’t able to win the war over tariffs, they’re
still getting something.

says no damage to its Arizona facilities after incident</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TAIPAI, TAIWAN — Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC said Thursday there was no
damage to its facilities after an incident at its Arizona factory
construction site where</p>
<p>a waste disposal truck driver was transported to a hospital.</p>
<p>Firefighters responded to a reported explosion Wednesday afternoon at
the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company plant in Phoenix, the
Arizona Republic reported, citing the local fire department.</p>
<p>TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker whose clients include
Apple and Nvidia, said in a statement none of its employees or onsite
construction workers had reported any related injuries.</p>
<p>“This is an active investigation with no additional details that can
be shared at this time,” it added.</p>
<p>TSMC’s Taipei-listed shares pared earlier gains after the news and
were last up around 0.8% on Thursday morning. TSMC last month agreed to
expand its planned investment by $25 billion to $65 billion and to add a
third Arizona plant by 2030.</p>
<p>The company will produce the world’s most advanced 2 nanometer
technology at its second Arizona facility expected to begin production

<h2 id="us-niger-delegation-meet-to-discuss-us-forces-withdrawal">US,
Niger delegation meet to discuss US forces withdrawal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Pentagon — After nearly a two-week delay, U.S. and Nigerien officials
are holding high-level follow-on meetings to coordinate the withdrawal
of American troops from the country.</p>
<p>Christopher Maier, assistant secretary of defense for special
operations and low-intensity conflict, and Lieutenant General Dagvin
Anderson, joint staff director for joint force development, are meeting
Wednesday and Thursday in Niamey with members of Niger’s new government,
known as the National Council for Safeguarding the Homeland, or CNSP,
two U.S. officials told VOA.</p>
<p>The CNSP posted on the social platform X Wednesday that Maier and
Anderson met Wednesday with Lieutenant General Salifou Mody, one of the
military coup members who was named minister of national defense. </p>
<p>The CNSP noted that the meeting comes two months after Niger
denounced its military basing agreements with the United States and aims
to “ensure that this withdrawal takes place in the best possible
conditions, guaranteeing order, security and compliance with set
deadlines.”</p>
<p>There are about 900 U.S. military personnel in Niger, including
active duty, civilians and contractors, according to the U.S. officials,
who spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity ahead of the conclusion of
the talks. Most of the U.S. military personnel have stayed in the
country past their deployment’s planned end dates, as details for their
withdrawal are ironed out.</p>
<p>“We’re still in a bit of a holding pattern,” Pentagon deputy press
secretary Sabrina Singh said last week.</p>
<p>Counterterrorism in ‘disarray’</p>
<p>The U.S. has had two military bases — Air Base 101 in Niamey and Air
Base 201 in Agadez —to monitor terror groups in the region. Officials
say most U.S. forces are based in the latter, which cost the U.S. $110
million to build, and began drone operations in 2019.</p>
<p>Niger’s natural resources have increased its importance to global
powers, and Niger’s location had provided the U.S. with the ability to
conduct counterterror operations throughout much of West Africa.</p>
<p>“We’re in a different position now, and we’re going to continue to
consult with the Nigeriens in terms of the orderly withdrawal of U.S.
forces. We’re going to continue to stay engaged with the partners in the
region when it comes to terrorism and countering the terrorist threat,”
Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder told reporters on
Tuesday.</p>
<p>Countries in the region, including Niger, Mali, Nigeria and Burkina
Faso, have seen an expansive rise in jihadist movements. </p>
<p>According to the Global Terrorism Index, an annual report covering
terrorist incidents worldwide, more than half of the deaths caused by
terrorism last year were in the Sahel. </p>
<p>Niger’s neighbor, Burkina Faso, suffered the worst, with 1,907
fatalities from terrorism in 2023. </p>
<p>“These are some of the most dangerous areas in the world,” Bill
Roggio, editor of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies’ Long War
Journal, told VOA. “These countries are in dire threat of being overrun
by jihadist groups.”</p>
<p>Now, Niger’s coup has put the West’s ability to monitor terrorists
like the Islamic State and al-Qaida in the Sahel in “complete disarray,”
according to Roggio. </p>
<p>The United States’ intelligence-gathering capacity was limited
before, “but we’re approaching the point where intelligence-gathering is
practically at zero,” he said.</p>
<p>A U.S. defense official told VOA that “basically every flight,” even
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance drone flights, must be
approved by the junta. </p>
<p>“The beginning of April is when things started getting slower,” the
official told VOA. The junta began delaying and canceling the types of
U.S. military flights that had been quickly approved before then.</p>
<p>Carla Martinez Machain, a political science professor at the
University of Buffalo, believes the Pentagon will try to negotiate with
Chad for a more significant American troop presence, as the U.S.
struggles to find allies in what she called the “coup belt” — a
reference to the recent coups in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. </p>
<p>However, most U.S. forces have temporarily left from Chad for Germany
in recent weeks, a move the Pentagon called a “temporary step” as part
of an ongoing review of its security cooperation with Chad, which would
resume after the country’s May 6 presidential election. </p>
<p>Only a small group of service members remain in Chad as part of a
multinational task force, officials tell VOA.</p>
<p>“Niger was somewhat of a rarity in the sense that it had one of the
few democratically elected governments in the region, and also a
democratically elected government that was friendly to the U.S. and
willing to host a U.S. military presence,” Martinez Machain told VOA.
“And so, finding a replacement for that for a military base is going to
be somewhat difficult.” </p>
<p>Unless the U.S. can find another base to use in West Africa,
counterterror drones will likely have to spend most of their fuel supply
flying thousands of kilometers from U.S. bases in Italy or Djibouti,
severely limiting their time over the targets and their ability to
gather intelligence.</p>
<p>“The beauty of having drones based in Niger was that they were in the
thick of the fight. They were in the middle of where jihadist groups are
operating. So, once you launch the drones, they’re in the midst of it,
and all of the flight time being used can be used to gather
information,” Roggio said.</p>
<p>Resupply concerns</p>
<p>Amid the negotiations and flight cancellations, U.S. troops in Niger
began raising concerns about their supply chain. Service members in
Niamey told the office of Representative Matt Gaetz that blood for the
blood bank, hygiene supplies, malaria pills and other medications were
running low. </p>
<p>A U.S. defense official acknowledged to VOA that “they were concerned
about medication levels.” The official also said that troops in Niamey
had gone through April without a resupply flight but had received food
and water supplies through ground-based transportation.</p>
<p>A flight with medical supplies finally went from Agadez to Niamey
last week, the defense official told VOA.</p>
<p>Coup forced withdrawal</p>
<p>Tensions between the U.S. and Niger began in 2023 when Niger’s
military junta removed the democratically elected president from
power. </p>
<p>After months of delay, the Biden administration formally declared in
October that the military takeover in Niger was a coup, a determination
that prevented Niger from receiving a significant amount of U.S.
military and foreign assistance.</p>
<p>In March, after tense meetings between U.S. representatives and the
CNSP, the junta called the U.S. military presence “illegal” and
announced it was ending an agreement that allowed American forces to be
based in the country.</p>
<p>During that meeting, the U.S. and Niger fundamentally disagreed about
Niger’s desire to supply Iran with uranium and work more closely with
Russian military forces.</p>
<p>“They [Niger] saw this as kind of an imperialistic move, and this was
seen negatively and was part of the reason why the U.S. was told to
leave the country,” Martinez Machain said.</p>
<p>Russia has made significant military inroads across the African
continent, Martinez Machain added, because human rights violators are
able to obtain military training, assistance and defense systems
“without the conditions that the U.S. would attach them.”</p>
<p>“Especially for nondemocratic countries, this can seem very
appealing,” she said.</p>

id="fewer-us-overdose-deaths-reported-last-year-but-experts-still-cautious">Fewer
US overdose deaths reported last year, but experts still cautious</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — The number of fatal overdoses in the U.S. fell last year,
according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data posted
Wednesday.</p>
<p>Agency officials noted that the data is provisional and could change
after more analysis, and that they still expect a drop when the final
counts are in. It would be only the second annual decline since the
current national drug death epidemic began more than three decades
ago.</p>
<p>Experts reacted cautiously. One described the decline as relatively
small and said it should be thought of as part of a leveling off rather
than a decrease. Another noted that the last time a decline occurred —
in 2018 — drug deaths shot up in the years that followed.</p>
<p>“Any decline is encouraging,” said Brandon Marshall, a Brown
University researcher who studies overdose trends. “But I think it’s
certainly premature to celebrate or to draw any large-scale conclusions
about where we may be headed long term with this crisis.”</p>
<p>It’s also too soon to know what spurred the decline, Marshall and
other experts said. Explanations could include shifts in the drug
supply, expansion of overdose prevention and addiction treatment, and
the grim possibility that the epidemic has killed so many that now there
are basically fewer people to kill.</p>
<p>CDC Chief Medical Officer Dr. Debra Houry called the dip “heartening
news” and praised efforts to reduce the tally, but she noted that “there
are still families and friends losing their loved ones to drug overdoses
at staggering numbers.”</p>
<p>About 107,500 people died of overdoses in the U.S. last year,
including American citizens and noncitizens who were in the country at
the time they died, the CDC estimated. That’s down 3% from 2022, when
there were an estimated 111,000 such deaths, the agency said.</p>
<p>The drug overdose epidemic, which has killed more than 1 million
people since 1999, has had many ripple effects. For example, a study
published last week in JAMA Psychiatry estimated that more than 321,000
U.S. children lost a parent to a fatal drug overdose from 2011 to
2021.</p>
<p>“These children need support” and are at a higher risk of mental
health and drug use disorders themselves, said Dr. Nora Volkow, director
of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which helped lead the study.
“It’s not just a loss of a person. It’s also the implications that loss
has for the family left behind.”</p>
<p>Prescription painkillers once drove the nation’s overdose epidemic,
but they were supplanted years ago by heroin and more recently by
illegal fentanyl. The dangerously powerful opioid was developed to treat
intense pain from ailments such as cancer but has increasingly been
mixed with other drugs in the illicit drug supply.</p>
<p>For years, fentanyl was frequently injected, but increasingly it’s
being smoked or mixed into counterfeit pills.</p>
<p>A study published last week found that law enforcement seizures of
pills containing fentanyl are rising dramatically, jumping from 44
million in 2022 to more than 115 million last year.</p>
<p>It’s possible that the seizures indicate that the overall supply of
fentanyl-laced pills is growing fast, not necessarily that police are
whittling down the illicit drug supply, said one of the paper’s authors,
Dr. Daniel Ciccarone of the University of California, San Francisco.</p>
<p>He noted that the decline in overdoses was not uniform. All but two
of the states in the eastern half of the U.S. saw declines, but most
Western states saw increases. Alaska, Washington and Oregon each saw 27%
increases.</p>
<p>The reason? Many Eastern states have been dealing with fentanyl for
about a decade, while it’s reached Western states more recently,
Ciccarone said.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some researchers say there are reasons to be
optimistic. It’s possible that smoking fentanyl is not as lethal as
injecting it, but scientists are still exploring that question.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, more money is becoming available to treat addiction and
prevent overdoses, through government funding and legal settlements with
drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies, Ciccarone noted.</p>
<p>“My hope is 2023 is the beginning of a turning point,” he said.</p>

id="qualcomm-details-linux-on-snapdragon-x-elite-and-its-looking-surprisingly-good">Qualcomm
details Linux on Snapdragon X Elite, and it’s looking surprisingly
good</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>With Qualcomm and Microsoft about to flood the market with devices
using the new Snapdragon X Elite, those of us who don’t want to use
Windows felt a bit uneasy – what’s Linux support going to look like for
this new generation of ARM devices? Well, it seems Qualcomm’s been busy,
and they’ve published a blog post detailing their work on Linux support
for the X Elite. It’s been our priority not only to support Linux on our
premium-tier SoCs, but to support it pronto. In fact, within one or two
days of publicly announcing each generation of Snapdragon 8, we’ve
posted the initial patchset for Linux kernel support. Snapdragon X Elite
was no exception: we announced on October 23 of last year and posted the
patchset the next day. That was the result of a lot of pre-announcement
work to get everything up and running on Linux and Debian. ↫ Qualcomm’s
developer blog In the blog post, the company details exactly which X
Elite features have already been merged into mainline with Linux 6.8 and
6.9, as well as which features will be merged into mainline in Linux
6.10 and 6.11, and to be quite frank – it’s looking really solid,
especially considering this is Qualcomm we’re talking about. Over the
coming six months, they’re going to focus on getting end-to-end hardware
video decoding working, including in Firefox and Chrome, as well as
various CPU and GPU optimisations, adding the required firmware to the
linux-firmware package, and providing access to easy installers. All in
all, it’s looking like the X Elite will be exceptionally well supported
by Linux before the year’s over. The blog post also details the boot
path for Linux on the X Elite, and that, too, is looking good. It’s
using a standard UEFI boot process, and supports GRUB and systemd-boot
out of the box. Linux boots up using devicetrees, though, and
apparently, there’s a known problem with using those that Qualcomm and
the community are working on. We’re working closely with upstream
communities on an open problem with the UEFI-based BIOS while booting
with devicetrees. The problem is that, when you have more than one
devicetree blob (DTB) packed into the firmware package flashed on the
device, there is no standard way of selecting a devicetree to pass on to
the kernel. OEMs commonly put multiple DTBs into the firmware package so
it will support devices with slightly different SKUs, so we’re keen to
solve this problem. ↫ Qualcomm’s developer blog I am pleasantly
surprised by the openness and straightforwardness Qualcomm is showing
the Linux community here, and I really hope this is a sign of how the
company will keep supporting its laptop and possibly desktop-oriented
SoCs from here on out. It seems like next year we will finally be
getting competitive ARM laptops that can run Linux in a fully supported
fashion.</p>

<h2 id="android-15-beta-2-released">Android 15 beta 2 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Google released Android 15 beta 2 today, and with it, they unveiled
some more of the new features coming to Android later this year when the
final release lands. Android 15 comes with something called a private
space, an area with an extra layer of authentication where you can keep
applications and data hidden away, such as banking applications or
health data. It’s effectively a separate user profile, and shows up as a
separate area in the application drawer when unlocked. When locked, it
disappears entirely from sight, share sheets, and so on. Another awesome
new feature is Theft Detection Lock, which uses Google “AI” to detect
when a phone is snatched out of your hands by someone running, biking,
or driving away, and instantly locks it. Theft like this is quite common
in certain areas, and this seems like an excellent use of “AI” (i.e.,
accelerometer data) to discourage thieves from trying this. There’s also
a bunch of smaller stuff, like custom vibration patterns per
notification, giving applications partial access to only your most
recent photos and videos, system-wide preferences for which gender you’d
like to be addressed as in gendered languages (French gets this feature
first), and a whole lot more. Developers also get a lot to play with
here, from safer intents to something like ANGLE: Vulkan is Android’s
preferred interface to the GPU. Therefore, Android 15 includes ANGLE as
an optional layer for running OpenGL ES on top of Vulkan. Moving to
ANGLE will standardize the Android OpenGL implementation for improved
compatibility, and, in some cases, improved performance. You can test
out your OpenGL ES app stability and performance with ANGLE by enabling
the developer option in Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Developer Options
-&gt; Experimental: Enable ANGLE on Android 15. ↫ Android developer blog
You can install Android 15 beta 2 on a number f Pixel devices and
devices from other OEMs starting today. I installed it on my Pixel 8
Pro, and after a few hours I haven’t really noticed anything breaking,
but that’s really not enough time to make any meaningful observations.
Google also detailed Wear OS 5. Later this year, battery life
optimizations are coming to watches with Wear OS 5. For example, running
an outdoor marathon will consume up to 20% less power when compared to
watches with Wear OS 4. And your fitness apps will be able to help
improve your performance with the option to support more data types like
ground contact time, stride length and vertical oscillation. ↫ Android
developer blog Wear OS 5 will also improve the Watch Face Format with
more complications, which is very welcome, because the selection of
complications is currently rather meager. Wear OS 5 will also ship later
this year.</p>

id="armed-with-ai-adversaries-will-try-to-tilt-us-election-security-officials-warn">Armed
with AI, adversaries will try to tilt US election, security officials
warn</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — America’s foreign adversaries will again seek to
influence the upcoming U.S. elections, top security officials warned
members of the Senate on Wednesday, harnessing the latest innovations in
artificial intelligence to spread online disinformation, mislead voters
and undermine trust in democracy.</p>
<p>But the U.S. has greatly improved its ability to safeguard election
security and identify and combat foreign disinformation campaigns since
2016, when Russia sought to influence the election, U.S. Director of
National Intelligence Avril Haines testified to the Senate Intelligence
Committee.</p>
<p>The latest warning from security officials came as advances in AI
make it easier and cheaper than ever to create lifelike images, video
and audio that can fool even the most discerning voter. Other tools of
disinformation include state media, online influencers, and networks of
fake accounts that can quickly amplify false and misleading content.</p>
<p>Russia, China and Iran remain the main actors looking to interfere
with the 2024 election, security officials said, but because of advances
in technology, other nations or even domestic groups could try to mount
their own sophisticated disinformation campaigns.</p>
<p>Russia remains “the most active foreign threat to our elections,”
Haines said, using its state media and online influencers to try to
erode trust in democratic institutions and U.S. support for Ukraine.</p>
<p>In recent months, Russia has seized on America’s debate over
immigration, spreading posts that exaggerate the impact of migration in
an apparent effort to stoke outrage among American voters.</p>
<p>China did not directly try to influence the outcome of the 2020
presidential election, mostly because of concerns about blowback, Haines
said.</p>
<p>China’s ties to TikTok were one of the things cited by members of
Congress who recently voted to force TikTok’s Beijing-based owner to
sell the platform.</p>
<p>“Needless to say, we will continue to monitor their activity,” Haines
said of China.</p>
<p>Iran, meanwhile, has used social media platforms to issue threats and
try to confuse voters, Haines said. She cited a 2020 episode in which
U.S. officials accused Tehran of distributing false content and being
behind a flurry of emails sent to Democratic voters in multiple
battleground states that appeared to be aimed at intimidating them into
voting for President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s hearing on foreign threats to the election also covered
the risk that an adversary could hack into state or local election
systems, either to change the vote or to create the perception that the
outcome can’t be trusted.</p>
<p>Jen Easterly, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency, said the federal government has worked closely with
state and local election officials to ensure the 2024 election is the
most secure ever.</p>
<p>“Election infrastructure has never been more secure,” Easterly
said.</p>

<h2 id="raspberry-pi-officially-announces-intent-to-ipo">Raspberry Pi
officially announces intent to IPO</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>As expected earlier this year, Raspberry Pi is going public on the
stock exchange in London. Back then, CEO Eben Upton said he did not
expect the IPO to change how Raspberry Pi did things, but history tells
us that initial public offerings tend to, well, change how companies do
things. In their official announcement that they intend to hold an IPO,
there’s an incredibly interesting and telling contradiction, as noted by
<span class="citation" data-cites="yassie_j">@yassie_j</span> on
MastoAkkoma: Raspberry Pi, in their listing press release, says: The
Enthusiast and Education market is the “heart” of the Raspberry Pi
movement. But also says: Industrial and Embedded market accounts over 72
per cent So the heart seems to be going neglected, it seems, because
there’s no way you’re going to not cash in on industrial applications.
Especially when you’ve just done a big IPO. ↫ <span class="citation"
data-cites="yassie_j">@yassie_j</span> on Akkoma This exactly
illustrates the fears we all have about what an IPO is going to mean for
Raspberry Pi. It’s already become increasingly more difficult for
enthusiasts to get their hands on the latest Raspberry Pi models, but
once the IPO’s done and there’s shareholders breathing down their neck,
that will most likely only get worse. If the industrial and embedded
market is where you’re making most of your money, where do you think
Raspberry Pi devices are going to end up? Luckily the market’s a lot
bigger and more varied now than it was back when Raspberry Pi was new,
so we have a wide variety of options to choose from. Still, I’m
definitely worried about what Raspberry Pi, as a company, will look like
five, ten years from now.</p>

id="kennedy-regarded-as-potential-spoiler-in-us-presidential-election">Kennedy
regarded as potential spoiler in US presidential election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>white house — There are few things the presidential campaigns of
Donald Trump and Joe Biden agree on. One is the presidential candidacy
of activist-lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Both the Biden and Trump camps
see Kennedy as a potential spoiler in this November’s election.</p>
<p>About half of registered voters have told pollsters that if given the
chance, they would replace both Biden and Trump on this year’s
ballot.</p>
<p>“If you picture what this country is going to look like in November
if either President Trump or President Biden won, the division is going
to continue,” Kennedy said at a California campaign event to introduce
his running mate, 38-year-old attorney and philanthropist Nicole
Shanahan. “The anger, the vitriol, the chaos, the polarization is going
to worsen. The only way to end that is through my successful
candidacy.”</p>
<p>Neither Kennedy nor Shanahan has ever held elective office.</p>
<p>Kennedy’s father was Robert F. Kennedy, a former U.S. attorney
general and a senator, and a major contender in the 1968 Democratic
Party presidential primary until he was assassinated. His uncle was
President John F. Kennedy, slain while in office in 1963.</p>
<p>“Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is not going to be the next president,”
predicts Georgetown University Associate Professor Hans Noel, echoing
the consensus of his fellow political scientists.</p>
<p>What worries the Biden and Trump campaigns is the possibility of
Kennedy on the ballot in the half-dozen or so swing states where his
mere thousands of votes could “change the outcome of that state. Then of
course, that tips the direction of that state — if that state is large
enough — and the ultimate election is fairly close, which is what we
expect. Then, it could change the outcome of the race,” Noel tells
VOA.</p>
<p>During a recent appearance on MSNBC, Kennedy declared “I’m going to
be on the ballot in every state. I’ll be on the ballot in every state by
July.”</p>
<p>Kennedy’s team declined VOA’s request to make the candidate or a
surrogate available to respond to questions, saying “the campaign has
decided to only grant interviews to U.S press with targeted U.S.
audiences at this time.”</p>
<p>The Kennedy clan “is not happy at all that he’s running, and they’ve
made a number of efforts to make that very clear,” notes Noel.</p>
<p>Biden, during a recent campaign appearance in the critical swing
state of Pennsylvania, was surrounded by Kennedy family members,
including the independent candidate’s sister, Kerry Kennedy, who said
“We want to make crystal clear our feeling that the best way forward for
America is to reelect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to four more
years.”</p>
<p>Candidate Kennedy’s beliefs about vaccines, the origins of COVID-19,
and the assassinations of his father and uncle have attracted some
supporters, including those who said they previously voted for Trump or
Biden.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Kennedy attracted the most media attention not for
his positions on any political issue but for a revelation from a 2012
deposition for a divorce. In it, he said cognitive issues that had
harmed his earning potential could have been “caused by a worm that got
into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died.”</p>
<p>In a social media post after the brain worm wriggled into the
headlines across the country, Kennedy quipped, “I offer to eat 5 more
brain worms and still beat President Trump and President Biden in a
debate.”</p>
<p>Political pundits are split on whether Kennedy poses more of a threat
to Trump or Biden.</p>
<p>“Kennedy is much more popular among Republicans than he is among
Democrats right now. But that’s probably mostly because he’s a Democrat
or former Democrat who says bad things about other Democrats,” said
Noel. “And, so, Republicans like to hear that, and they think that
sounds interesting. But they’re not going to vote for that over Donald
Trump.”</p>
<p>The Republican National Committee, attempting to dissuade
conservatives who oppose abortion from considering Kennedy as an
alternative to Trump, stated, “There is exactly zero daylight between
the abortion extremism of RFK Jr. and Crooked Joe Biden.”</p>
<p>The Democratic National Committee filed a complaint against Kennedy
in February with the Federal Election Commission alleging a political
action committee was illegally coordinating with the independent
candidate’s campaign to get him on additional state ballots.</p>
<p>Biden’s party also portrays Kennedy as a “spoiler for Donald Trump,”
according to Matt Corridoni, a DNC spokesperson.</p>
<p>“RFK Jr.’s campaign isn’t building a plan or a strategy to get 270
electoral votes. They’re building one to help Trump return to the Oval
Office,” he says.</p>
<p>The New York Times calls Kennedy the “X factor” in this year’s
presidential election, noting that the latest public opinion survey,
organized by the newspaper The Philadelphia Inquirer and Siena College,
shows him polling stronger than any third-party candidate in decades.
The poll has Kennedy being supported by about 10% of registered voters
in the battleground states, drawing equally from both Biden and
Trump.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Google I/O 2024 is underway and a bunch of articles came out about what Google&#39;s changes to its core product (search) mean for the web as a whole. Sean Hollister at The Verge &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24074314/google-now-offers-web-search&quot;&gt;has a piece on the new “web” search option&lt;/a&gt; (a piece that starts with &lt;em&gt;“This is not a joke”&lt;/em&gt;) while Casey Newton wrote a  nice articled titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.platformer.news/google-io-ai-search-sundar-pichai/&quot;&gt;“Google’s broken link to the web”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Unsurprisingly Google has revealed that AI is going to be integrated
pretty much everywhere, and the goal is to let the AI do the googling
for you. Which sounds great, in theory. After all, as the fine people at
The Browser Company have eloquently explained to the world, the web is
in such a terrible state that the only way out of this madness is to let
an AI deal with all the garbage and spammy content that’s out there. I
already
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/a-rant-on-arc-search">expressed my
doubts about this plan</a> and I don’t think what Google is doing is any
better.
</p>
<p>
Google, as a company, is in an odd position. They are, fundamentally, an
advertising company. Almost 70% of their revenues are generated by ads.
Ads on the SERP, ads on their various products and ads served by their
ad network on 3rd party websites. When they say that they’re going to do
the googling for you they don’t just mean the search part. In theory, AI
will also go find the information you’re looking for on 3rd party sites
so they’ll do the googling but also the actual browsing. Did you spot
the issue? How are people going to consume ads on 3rd party sites if you
no longer need to visit 3rd party sites? And if AI is going to take over
the entire top part of the SERP with its generated answer, why should
companies pay Google to appear at the top of the search results if those
search results are not going to be seen by the majority of people?
</p>
<p>
It’s a bizarre situation. The answer to missing ad revenues is obviously
going to be more ads. I’m sure Google will figure out a way to inject
ads into their AI-generated bullshit.
</p>
<p>
Some people are obviously freaking out about the recent news. That’s
because a huge number of sites out there rely on Google to bring traffic
to their websites, sites that are then monetised via ads in most cases.
If traffic goes down, ad revenues go down. And that’s a bad thing,
right? Right? Well, maybe? I guess it depends. The current state of the
web is unsustainable. And maybe AI and AI-generated garbage is what we
need to push the current situation over the edge and force some changes.
</p>
<p>
I think curation, actual human curation, is going to play an important
role in the future. In a web filled with generated nonsense, content
curated by knowledgeable human beings is going to be incredibly
valuable.
</p>
<p>
I find this current phase of the web incredibly interesting. I have no
idea how things will evolve but I’m glad I can be part of it, even just
as an external observer.

a new guideline banning the use of code generated by such tools from
being added to NetBSD unless explicitly permitted by “core“, NetBSD’s
equivalent, roughly, of “technical management”. Code generated by a
large language model or similar technology, such as such as
GitHub/Microsoft’s Copilot, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, or Facebook/Meta’s Code
Llama, is presumed to be tainted code, and must not be committed without
prior written approval by core. ↫ NetBSD Commit Guidelines GitHub
Copilot is copyright infringement and open source license violation at

<h2 id="the-u.s.-oil-industry-is-full-of-hypocrites">The U.S. Oil
Industry Is Full of Hypocrites</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjI1MjQ0NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NTk1MDEzMH0.NqWvZ3tEugFLr5zxl3k5cv0gZ-Y8d-8Uo7_7Uf3mWgE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The Federal Trade Commission earlier this month threw sand in the gears
of one of several big oil company deals currently in the works, the $60
billion acquisition of shale oil company Pioneer by Exxon. While the FTC
didn’t block the sale, it said that Pioneer’s chief executive, Scott
Sheffield, could not join Exxon’s board, as proposed in the merger
agreement, because of his role in seeking to coordinate oil production
and push up prices.
</p>
<p>
It was yet another Rorschach test of the
<a href="https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.768" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mid-transition</u></a>
— oil folk saw regulator overreach or pettiness under a Democratic
administration, while climate campaigners saw shameless profiteering by
the oil industry. What it really reveals is more complex: The illusion
of laissez-faire oil markets; the disingenuousness (if not hypocrisy) of
the U.S. oil industry; and the need for U.S. policymakers to take a much
more interventionist stance in oil markets.
</p>
<p>
First, the FTC complaint. Sheffield, fêted in the oil world as one of
the key instigators of the U.S. shale oil boom, has called on peers in
the sector to refrain from drilling when prices were low. The commission
also quoted public remarks by Sheffield referring to U.S. oil companies
“staying in line,” being disciplined in their production, and being
punished by shareholders if they sought to grow production.
</p>
<p>
He went further than that, though, according to the FTC. In a heavily
redacted section of the complaint, the Commission describes Sheffield
meeting with OPEC officials and communicating with them by WhatsApp. “If
Texas leads the way, maybe we can get OPEC to cut production. Maybe
Saudi and Russia will follow. That was our plan,”<em> </em>he said in
one
<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/05/ftc-order-bans-former-pioneer-ceo-exxon-board-seat-exxon-pioneer-deal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>text
message</u></a> cited by the Commission. He added: “I was using the
tactics of OPEC+ to get a bigger OPEC+ done.” Pioneer
<a href="https://investors.pxd.com/investors/news-releases/news-details/2024/Pioneer-Natural-Resources-Responds-to-FTC-Settlement-Complaint-Filed-as-Part-of-Approval-of-Proposed-Transaction-with-ExxonMobil/default.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>issued
a statement</u></a> saying that circumventing competition rules was
“neither the intent nor the effect” of Sheffield’s comments and pointing
to Pioneer’s role in increasing U.S. production.
</p>
<p>
Coordinating on prices, however, is the norm in the history of oil
markets — even in the U.S. It shouldn’t be so shocking that the
purportedly free market-loving oil industry would engage in this kind of
behavior.
</p>
<p>
A lot of Sheffield’s activity mentioned by the FTC took place from
around 2020 to 2023, when oil demand was still uncertain thanks to
Covid. Even before then, the U.S. shale industry, which had boomed
through the late 2010s, was under pressure from institutional investors,
frustrated as all the new supply undermined their profits. Exxon, whose
antecedent Rockefeller famously took control of transport to manage the
oil market, is so big and cash-rich that it can largely ride out market
fluctuations; the smaller and newer shale oil producers, reliant on
increasingly impatient investors, could not.
</p>
<p>
No wonder Sheffield was vocal about restricting supply: He had a large
company and a high profile among a sea of smaller players that were
fracking madly even as prices fell.
</p>
<p>
Oil prices are notoriously volatile, which serves neither producers nor
consumers. If prices are too low, the industry logic goes, no-one
invests. Too high, and there’s a risk that demand for the stuff falls —
especially if it prompts a recession. To keep prices in a sweet spot, a
good chunk of the market has to be prepared to refrain from pumping.
Turning the taps on and off is a role that Saudi Arabia and fellow OPEC
petrostates have taken for decades. The nature of shale oil means it is
a “swing producer” that can switch up and down its output with relative
ease compared to other producers.
</p>
<p>
The market dynamics changed quickly when Russia invaded Ukraine in early
2022. Since then, U.S. oil producers have been pumping more than ever,
to the point where the country is now the world’s biggest producer. None
of this has stopped the industry from continuing to loathe the Biden
administration, of course. (Sheffield himself
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c21eb656-8d09-45ce-a13a-7d8419426b05" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said
in 2021</u></a> that the administration was trying “to slow down U.S.
drilling in any way they can.”)
</p>
<p>
The U.S. government is the one actor with enough power to influence
global oil <em><em>demand</em></em> that has largely sat on its hands.
The oil industry often engages in a kind of collective delayed
gratification to keep oil prices in a sweet spot: high enough to
maximize profits, but not so high that households and businesses start
cutting back on their fuel use. Far less effort has gone into a kind of
reverse strategy. There have been few attempts to reduce supply without
disruptive price volatility — the kind of government inaction that pits
voters against lawmakers and hurts households that really feel the pinch
from higher gasoline prices.
</p>
<p>
Having intervened extensively in the preceding decades, during the
1980s, the U.S. government backed away from the complex price controls
of the Nixon presidency and the demand-curtailing measures of Carter’s.
With OPEC’s strategy being fairly straightforward, a couple of decades
of relative stability followed, along with the assumption that the
market would self-correct whenever prices went too high for consumers or
too low for producers. Bassam Fattouh of Oxford Institute for Energy
Studies argued that it was the perception of a self-correcting
supply-demand dynamic that “stabilized long term expectations about oil
prices”<em> </em>in that period.
</p>
<p>
The “mid-transition” idea, developed by academics Emily Grubert and Sara
Hastings-Simon in a 2022 paper, asserts that the process of
decarbonization involves a drawn-out, messy, liminal phase, during which
changes to energy costs and supply will shape a society’s perception of
clean energy so much that negative experiences like price spikes or
supply interruptions will undermine political support for the
transition.
</p>
<p>
In 2023, the Biden administration broke the U.S. government’s
longstanding precedent and began intervening in oil prices with an eye
beyond manipulating the immediate consumer price. It announced a target
price for buying several hundred million barrels of oil to restock the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which had been depleted after the invasion
of Ukraine sent prices spiking. By pledging to buy crude whenever the
price was between $67 and $72 a barrel, it would do what Employ America,
a think tank, had
<a href="https://www.employamerica.org/researchreports/contingent-supply-maximizing-crude-how-the-spr-can-incentivize-additional-domestic-production/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>proposed</u></a>:
Set a floor under prices that would help U.S. producers, as well as a
ceiling that would avoid pain at the pump.
</p>
<p>
“Mid-transition” is a relatively new concept, but it harks back to a
more established phrase in climate policy: “smooth transition,” which
describes a pathway to decarbonization that is steady but not
disruptive. Stimulating or restraining oil production in a way that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/oil-companies-are-preparing-for-a-lucrative-decline" target="_blank">stabilizes
oil investment and prices</a> — if done effectively and with the right
intentions — is a necessary condition for such smoothness. Sheffield and
other producers, including OPEC+ members, have for decades sought to
manage oil supply to ensure that price spikes don’t disrupt oil’s
future. For all that the U.S. oil industry castigates the Biden
administration, they are actually pursuing the same goal, just with a
different view of the end game.

Is Dominating the Carbon Removal Market — But No One Seems to Care</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Low-tech carbon removal is all the rage these days. Whether it’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-4-enhanced-rock-weathering" target="_self"><u>spreading
crushed rocks on fields</u></a> or
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/vaulted-deep-carbon-removal" target="_self"><u>injecting
sludgy biomass underground</u></a>, relatively simplistic solutions have
seen a boom in funding. But there’s one cheap, nature-based method that
hasn’t been able to drum up as much attention from big name climate
investors: biochar.
</p>
<p>
This flaky, charcoal-like substance has been produced and used as a
fertilizer for millennia, and its potential to lock up the carbon
contained in organic matter is well-documented. It’s made by heating up
biomass such as wood or plants in a low-oxygen environment via a process
called pyrolysis, thereby sequestering up to 40% to 50% of the carbon
contained within that organic matter for hundreds or (debatably — but
we’ll get to that) even thousands of years. Ideally, the process
utilizes waste biomass such as plant material and forest residue left
over from harvesting crops or timber, which otherwise might just be
burned.
</p>
<p>
The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says
biochar could store about
<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport.pdf" target="_blank">2.6
billion metric tons</a> of CO2 per year. And by some metrics, this
ancient method of carbon removal is already leagues ahead of the rest.
Last year, biochar accounted for 94% of all carbon dioxide removal
credits that were actually fulfilled,
<a href="https://www.cdr.fyi/blog/2023-year-in-review" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according
to CDR.fyi</u></a>, which tracks the CO2 removal market. That means that
while corporate buyers are purchasing carbon credits that use an array
of different removal methods, biochar has thus far dominated the market
when it comes to actually making good on these purchases.
</p>
<p>
Some of the largest corporate buyers of CO2 removal credits have biochar
in their portfolios. Microsoft, by far the most prominent player in this
space, has bought over 200,000 tons of biochar credits — part of its
quest to become
<a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>carbon
negative</u></a> by 2050 — although that’s still a mere fraction of the
over 6.6 million tons of CO2 removal the company has bought overall.
JPMorgan Chase, which aims to match every ton of its operational
emissions with carbon dioxide removal credits by 2030, has bought nearly
19,000 tons of biochar credits, representing about 26% of its CO2
removal portfolio.
</p>
<p>
But despite its technical maturity, biochar has yet to generate the same
level of excitement or venture capital investment as more complex
methods of carbon removal such as direct air capture, which
<a href="https://www.cdr.fyi/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fdiob2hk5%2Fposts%2F3d77c407e2bfe33ea933979e0873d9b962c30aa0-1240x1282.png&w=1920&q=75" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>garnered
$142 million in investment last year</u></a>. By comparison, biochar
companies raised a cumulative total of $74 million in 2023. While that’s
no small change, it doesn’t compare to the amount of capital VCs and
other climate tech funders have poured even into other similarly
elemental carbon removal technologies.
</p>
<p>
For example, Frontier, a collaborative fund for tech companies to
catalyze emerging solutions in this space, recently announced a $58
million deal with Vaulted Deep, a startup that injects wet biomass from
food waste to poop deep underground. And at the end of last year,
Frontier inked a $57 million deal with Lithos Carbon, a company pursuing
enhanced rock weathering. This involves spreading crushed up rocks onto
fields, which react with the CO2 in the air to form bicarbonate; that’s
eventually carried out to sea, where the carbon remains permanently
sequestered on the ocean floor. In other words, it’s just an
acceleration of the natural weathering process, which normally takes
hundreds of thousands of years. VCs backing Lithos include mainstream
names like Union Square Ventures, Greylock Ventures, and Bain Capital
Ventures, while big-time climate tech VC Lowercarbon Capital led Vaulted
Deep’s seed round.
</p>
<p>
The questions around biochar’s durability — that is, how long it can
actually lock away carbon — are potentially unanswerable, and that’s at
least partially driving investor reticence.
</p>
<p>
“Biochar falls in this very interesting middle ground - you create it,
and then it is constantly degrading,” Freya Chay, program lead at
CarbonPlan, a nonprofit that analyzes different carbon removal pathways,
told me. She said that we just don’t have the scientific know-how “to
predict, really clearly, how much is going to still be in your soil at
100 years or at 1,000 years.”
</p>
<p>
Frontier, for its part, only considers carbon removal “permanent” if it
can sequester carbon for at least 1,000 years.
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166516223002276" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Some
studies indicate</a> that a large proportion of biochar can achieve
this, but it’s hard to definitively prove, and we’re far from a
scientific consensus. Thus far the fund has steered clear of investing
in biochar,
<a href="https://gaps.frontierclimate.com/gap-details?recordId=recsPU8VIjuOO7LK3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>noting
that detailed protocols must be developed</u></a> to measure its
durability under a variety of soil and weather conditions.
</p>
<p>
Measurement, reporting and verification is often the downfall for
nature-based solutions (see: the hoopla around
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bogus
forest carbon credits</u></a>). And while it <em><em>is</em></em> simple
to measure how much of the carbon in biomass ends up sequestered in
biochar, “it’s where you draw the project boundaries in terms of where
the MRV falls apart,” Annie Nichols, director of operations and project
management at Pacific Biochar told me. For example, one might want to
ensure that trees aren’t being cut down or crops aren’t being grown just
for the purpose of creating biochar, and this often falls outside the
scope of traditional measurement protocols. Pacific Biochar, for its
part, sources its waste biomass from forests in high fire risk areas of
California, where the excessive accumulation of woody debris poses a
danger.
</p>
<p>
Pacific Biochar
<a href="https://www.cdr.fyi/leaderboards" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ranks
as the world’s third largest supplier</u></a> of carbon removal, with
over 28,000 tons of credits delivered. Biochar “got a lot of attention
before there was actually much utility,” its CEO, Josiah Hunt told me,
referring to the period in the late 2000s when Al Gore was heavily
hyping its benefits. In his 2009 book “Our Choice,” Gore called biochar
“one of the most exciting new strategies for restoring carbon to
depleted soils, and sequestering significant amounts of CO2 for 1,000
years and more.” But at that time, Hunt said, “There weren’t really
carbon markets ready to work with it yet.”
</p>
<p>
Prior to 2020, Pacific Biochar’s revenue relied solely on biochar
fertilizer sales to farmers. It was only when the carbon credits market
picked up that the company was able to scale. Today, Pacific Biochar
sells most of its credits directly, as opposed to on an independent
exchange, though it works with the carbon credits platform Carbonfuture
to deliver credits to customers and perform the necessary verification
to ensure the company’s carbon removal data is accurate.
</p>
<p>
Pacific Biochar’s credits sell for $180 per metric ton, cheaper than
nearly all other removal methods and far below the weighted average of
$488 for CO2 removal. That’s because producing biochar via pyrolysis
requires much less energy than something like direct air capture. It’s
also a more mature process than most emergent nature-based solutions
such as enhanced rock weathering, meaning that comparably less money
needs to be spent demonstrating that the process works as intended.
</p>
<p>
A number of biochar companies told me they think biochar has been
overlooked in favor of more novel technological solutions. “There’s this
fixation on trying to find the high tech solution, the SaaS app that’s
going to solve climate change,” Thor Kallestad, CEO and cofounder of
Myno Carbon, told me. By comparison, biochar can seem like a relic of an
earlier era that never quite reached its potential.
</p>
<p>
Myno, founded by oil and gas veterans, is self-funding the buildout of a
large-scale biochar and electricity co-generation facility in Port
Angeles, Washington, which will source its fuel from the copious timber
waste in Washington State. It’s still in the initial design phase, but
the ultimate goal is to produce about 70,000 tons of biochar per year
alongside 20 megawatts of power. That amounts to about 100,000 carbon
dioxide removal credits, which Kallestad hopes to sell for less than
$100 per metric ton. Ideally, he said, the plant will serve as a proof
of concept that will help drive future investments.
</p>
<p>
While there haven’t yet been any major scandals in the biochar-sourcing
world, the BBC ran an exposé in 2022 on a biomass-fueled
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-63089348" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>power
station in the UK</u></a> that was logging old-growth forests to create
wood pellets that were then burned for power. The company, Drax, had
previously claimed that it was only sourcing sawdust and waste wood.
While Drax maintains that its biomass is “sustainable and legally
harvested,”
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68381160" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>further
reporting indicates</u></a> that as of last year, the company was still
sourcing from old-growth forests. The worry is that something similar
could happen with biochar production as demand ramps up.
</p>
<p>
Chay says the cost-benefit analysis for making biochar gets even
thornier when taking into account the “counterfactual of how we
otherwise could have used biomass.” After all, biomass can also be
burned for energy, and if the emissions are captured and stored, that’s
a carbon removal strategy too. And with many looking towards
biomass-based fuels as a way to decarbonize industries such as aviation
and shipping, demand for waste biomass appears set to increase alongside
uncertainty regarding its best use case. “Zooming forward to 2050, I’m
not sure there is anything such as waste biomass,” Chay told me.
</p>
<p>
But in the short-term at least, there’s enough to go around.
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/bioenergy/2023-billion-ton-report-assessment-us-renewable-carbon-resources" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>A
recent Department of Energy</u></a> report noted that “available but
unused” biomass such as logging and agricultural residue could
contribute around 350 tons to the nation’s supply every year. That’s
about as much biomass as the United States uses for bioenergy today
</p>
<p>
“Certainly biochar has a place,” Chay said. She’s not convinced that it
will ever make sense to conceptualize biochar production as “permanent
carbon removal” though. “Maybe we just let it be this kind of
interstitial durability. We figure out how to value that while also
optimizing for agricultural co-benefits.”
</p>
<p>
Investors may remain wary of a solution that occupies this
hard-to-define space between short and long-term CO2 removal, but Hunt’s
not too worried. “I don’t think that’s horribly detrimental,” he told
me. He sees biochar’s strong performance in the carbon credits
marketplace as enough to sustain the industry for now. “I do think the
buying community is what drives our growth. And even if we’re not the
unicorns, even if we’re just the work mules, that’s fine with me. I
don’t mind being the mule of climate change action.”

<h2 id="jury-chosen-for-us-senator-menendezs-corruption-trial">Jury
chosen for US Senator Menendez’s corruption trial</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — A jury was chosen on Wednesday to determine whether U.S.
Senator Robert Menendez broke the law in what federal prosecutors have
called a yearslong bribery scheme to benefit the governments of Egypt
and Qatar, as well as himself. </p>
<p>Opening statements in the trial of New Jersey’s senior senator are
expected to begin later in the day before U.S. District Judge Sidney
Stein in Manhattan. The trial could last into early July. </p>
<p>Twelve jurors and six alternates were chosen, including an investment
banker, a commercial litigator, a retired economist, a doctor and
multiple therapists. Jury selection took about 2½, and more than 130
prospective jurors were excused. </p>
<p>Menendez, 70, faces 16 criminal charges including bribery, fraud,
acting as a foreign agent and obstruction. </p>
<p>He is being tried alongside New Jersey businessmen Wael Hana and Fred
Daibes. The senator’s wife, Nadine Menendez, 57, is scheduled to be
tried on July 8, with the delay resulting from what her lawyers called a
serious medical condition. </p>
<p>All the defendants have pleaded not guilty. The bribery trial is the
senator’s second. His first ended in 2017 in a mistrial after jurors
deadlocked. </p>
<p>Prosecutors are expected to detail what they consider a complex and
sordid array of corruption that lasted from 2018 to 2023. </p>
<p>The Menendezes are accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of
dollars in bribes from Hana, Daibes and insurance broker Jose Uribe, in
exchange for the senator’s providing political favors and aid to Egypt
and Qatar.  </p>
<p>Prosecutors have said the senator promised to help Egypt obtain arms
sales and other aid, helped Hana obtain a lucrative monopoly on
certifying that meat exports to Egypt conformed to Islamic law, and
tried to help Daibes secure millions of dollars from a Qatari investment
fund. </p>
<p>Menendez, a Democrat, also was accused of trying to interfere in a
federal criminal case against Daibes in New Jersey and in state criminal
cases involving two of Uribe’s associates. </p>
<p>Prosecutors have said FBI agents found more than $480,000 of cash in
the Menendezes’ home, much stashed in clothing, closets and a safe. </p>
<p>Bribes also included more than $100,000 in gold bars and a $60,000
Mercedes-Benz convertible, according to prosecutors. </p>
<p>Uribe pleaded guilty in March to bribery and fraud, and he agreed to
cooperate with prosecutors. </p>
<p>While Nadine Menendez is not yet on trial, her husband’s lawyers have
suggested his defense might include an effort to blame her for
withholding information and making him believe his activities were
lawful. </p>
<p>Robert Menendez became a senator in 2006. Before being indicted, he
would have been favored in his Democratic-leaning state to win a fourth
full Senate term in November. </p>
<p>But any reelection bid now would be a long shot, reflecting recent
polls of voters that show overwhelming disapproval of Menendez’s job
performance. </p>
<p>Menendez has suggested that he would try if acquitted to run as an
independent. Only 9% of voters polled in March by Emerson College
Polling/PIX11/The Hill said they would prefer him to another Democrat or
a Republican. </p>
<p>The senator has resisted calls to resign made from across the
political spectrum but gave up leadership of the powerful Senate Foreign
Relations Committee after his indictment last September. </p>
<p>Stein admonished jurors to ignore media coverage of the trial. “If
something comes up,” the judge said, “switch off.”</p>

about the ways smuggling and human trafficking networks are exploiting
legitimate transportation services to facilitate illegal migration to
the United States through Nicaragua.</p>
<p>“Actions by the Nicaraguan government are of grave concern. President
Daniel Ortega and Vice President Rosario Murillo have put in place
permissive-by-design migration policies,” the Department of Homeland
Security said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Nicaraguan government did not immediately respond to a request
for comment.</p>
<p>Increasingly migrants have been flying into Nicaragua and then
heading north overland to the U.S.-Mexico border as some smugglers have
promoted the route through social networks.</p>
<p>Many migrants in recent years have started their journeys in Brazil
or other South American countries, but flying into Nicaragua avoids the
often perilous journey through the jungle region known as the Darien Gap
on the Colombia-Panama border.</p>
<p>The administration of President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has struggled
with record numbers of migrant crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border and,
as he runs for reelection in November, voters have increasingly said
that immigration is a top concern.</p>
<p>Senior Biden administration officials told reporters on a Wednesday
conference call that sanctions would be levied against a Russian
training center operating in Managua since October 2017 that enabled
anti-democratic behavior and repression.</p>
<p>A press release from the Treasury Department said Nicaragua was one
of Russia’s “main partners” in Central America and the training center
provided specialized courts to the Nicaraguan National Police (NNP),
which the statement called “a repressive state apparatus, carrying out
extrajudicial killings, using live ammunition against peaceful protests,
and even participating in death squads.”</p>
<p>In addition, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on two gold
companies it said were “government affiliated.”</p>
<p>Gold is Nicaragua’s top commodity export, the Treasury announcement
said, and “this action aims to degrade the ability of the Ortega-Murillo
regime to manipulate the sector and profit.” Reuters was not immediately
able to reach the companies for comment.</p>
<p>Migrant apprehensions on the border halved from December to March,
according to U.S. government data, in part because of increased
enforcement by Mexican authorities, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary
Alejandro Mayorkas has said.</p>

slaps sanctions on Sudan paramilitary commanders over Darfur
offensive</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on two
commanders of Sudan’s paramilitary force, vowing pressure to stop the
unit from an offensive on the Darfur city of el-Fasher.</p>
<p>The Treasury Department said it was freezing any U.S. assets and
criminalizing transactions with Ali Yagoub Gibril, Central Darfur
commander of the Rapid Support Forces, and an RSF major general involved
in operational planning, Osman Mohamed Hamid Mohamed.</p>
<p>“The RSF military operation to encircle and besiege el-Fasher, North
Darfur, has endangered the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians,”
State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement.</p>
<p>“We stand ready to take additional measures against those individuals
and institutions that actively escalate the war — including any
offensive actions on el-Fasher,” he said.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday also voiced alarm
over reports of heavy fighting in densely populated areas as the RSF
seeks control of el-Fasher, the last major city in Darfur not under its
control.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people have died, and millions have been
displaced since war broke out in April 2023 between Sudan’s army and the
RSF after their head generals refused a plan to integrate.</p>
<p>The United States has led diplomatic efforts to stop the fighting but
has seen limited success and leverage, with RSF commanders unlikely to
hold major assets in the West affected by sanctions.</p>
<p>The RSF and Sudan’s armed forces are seen as both wanting to secure a
battleground victory, and each side has received support from outside
players.</p>
<p>The U.S. special envoy for Sudan, Tom Perriello, is again traveling
around the Middle East and Africa this week in hopes of making
progress.</p>
<p>The United States has accused both sides of war crimes and charged
that the RSF has carried out ethnic cleansing and crimes against
humanity against the indigenous African-origin people of Darfur.</p>
<p>The RSF’s predecessor, the Janjaweed militia, carried out a
scorched-earth campaign in the arid western region that the United
States at the time described as genocide.</p>

<h2 id="gnome-os-is-switching-from-ostree-to-systemd-sysupdate">GNOME OS
is switching from OSTree to systemd-sysupdate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure most of you are familiar with KDE Neon, the
distribution KDE maintains to provide easy access to the latest KDE
technologies. However, did you know GNOME has something similar, called
GNOME OS? It’s been around for a while, but has a far lower profile than
KDE Neon does, and it seems they want to change that and put more of a
spotlight on GNOME OS. GNOME OS is an immutable distribution using
OSTree, the same technology used by the various popular immutable
versions from the Fedora family. It seems GNOME OS is working to leave
OSTree behind, and move to systemd-sysupdate instead, which has been
available since systemd 251, released in May 2022. The developers claim
this will bring the following benefits: To complete the move from OSTree
to systemd-sysupdate, a few things need to be completed. First, the boot
process and root filesystem had to be migrated, which was done last
year. Second, sysupdate needs to integrated into GNOME, as for now, you
can only use it via the command line. This work is ongoing, and requires
a new D-Bus service and polkit integration to allow GNOME Software to
manage the update process. Of course, there’s more work that needs to be
done to complete this migration, but these are the main tasks. All of
this work is part of the project’s goal to make GNOME OS nightlies
viable for daily-driving for quality assurance purposes, and I’m sure
all this work will also make GNOME OS more attractive to people outside
of the developer community. It’s basically GNOME/systemd taken to the
extreme, and while that will surely make quite a few people groan, I
personally find it great that this will make GNOME OS a more capable
choice for everyone. That’s what open source is all about, in the
end.</p>

id="us-will-send-an-unofficial-delegation-as-taiwans-president-is-sworn-in">US
will send an unofficial delegation as Taiwan’s president is sworn
in</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The White House will send an unofficial delegation to
Taiwan this weekend for the inauguration of the island’s democratically
elected president, the Biden administration announced Wednesday, in a
move that is certain to upset China but unlikely to draw excessive
responses from Beijing as the two countries try to stabilize
relations.</p>
<p>A senior White House official said the move is in line with
longstanding U.S. practice to send the delegation — which includes two
former senior officials and a scholar — to the inauguration ceremony
Monday. Lai Ching-te of the Democratic Progressive Party will take
office, succeeding Tsai Ing-wen of the same party.</p>
<p>Beijing, which sees Taiwan as part of Chinese territory and vows to
seize the island by force if necessary to achieve unification, sees Lai
as a supporter of Taiwan’s independence and has long opposed any
official contact between Washington and Taipei.</p>
<p>“In what ways the U.S. deals with the new Taiwan authorities on May
20 and afterwards will affect (the) cross-Strait situation and also the
China-U.S. relations in the future,” Liu Pengyu, spokesman for the
Chinese Embassy in Washington, said Tuesday before the announcement,
referring to the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>“So we urge the U.S. side to act on President Biden’s commitment of
not supporting Taiwan independence,” he said.</p>
<p>The U.S. delegation will be in Taipei “to represent the American
people,” the White House official told reporters on condition of
anonymity to discuss details of the trip before it was announced. The
official called Taiwan “a model for democracy not only in the region but
also globally.”</p>
<p>Despite an absence of formal relations with Taiwan, the U.S. is the
island’s strongest ally and is obligated under a 1979 law to help Taiwan
protect itself from invasion.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how Beijing would respond to an unofficial U.S.
delegation at the Taiwanese inauguration, but “Beijing will be the
provocateur should it choose to respond with additional military
pressure or coercion,” the U.S. official said, adding that the
administration is not predicting how China would respond.</p>
<p>Beijing has repeatedly warned Washington not to meddle with Taiwan’s
affairs, which it says are a core interest for China because it is a
matter of sovereignty and territorial integrity. Beijing sees
Washington’s support for Taiwan as provocative.</p>
<p>The U.S. insists any differences be resolved peacefully and opposes
any unilateral changes by either side to the status quo. “We do not
support Taiwan independence,” the administration official said. “We
support cross-Strait dialogue.”</p>
<p>Taiwan has topped the agenda in U.S.-China relations, which have
soured over issues ranging from trade, cybersecurity and human rights to
spying. The Biden administration, in its competition with China, has
engaged in “intense diplomacy” aimed at preventing tensions from
spiraling out of control.</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Secretary of State Antony Blinken
have recently visited China in the administration’s latest effort to
keep communications open and minimize misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Shortly after Lai was elected in January, President Joe Biden sent an
unofficial delegation to Taipei to meet Lai, drawing protests from
Beijing. Members of Congress also have traveled to Taiwan to meet the
president-elect. Plans are underway for a congressional delegation to
visit Taiwan shortly after the inauguration.</p>
<p>Beijing reiterated its claim over Taiwan immediately after Lai was
elected and said “the basic fact that Taiwan is part of China will not
change.” Days later, Nauru, a tiny Pacific nation, severed its
diplomatic ties with Taiwan, which now is recognized by 12 governments,
including the Vatican.</p>
<p>Since then, Beijing has criticized a U.S. destroyer’s passage through
the Taiwan Strait. The U.S. Navy’s 7th Fleet said the USS Halsey
“conducted a routine Taiwan Strait transit on May 8 through waters where
high-seas freedoms of navigation and overflight apply in accordance with
international law.”</p>
<p>Navy Senior Capt. Li Xi, speaking for China’s Eastern Theater
Command, accused the U.S. of having “publicly hyped” the passage of the
ship and said the command “organized naval and air forces to monitor”
the ship’s transit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a push to avoid Taiwan’s global recognition, Beijing
said this week that it would not agree to Taiwan’s participation in this
year’s World Health Assembly, an annual meeting by the World Health
Organization that could boost Taiwan’s visibility on the world
stage.</p>
<p>“China’s Taiwan region, unless given approval by the central
government, has no basis, reason or right to participate in the World
Health Assembly,” said Wang Wenbin, speaking for the Chinese foreign
ministry.</p>
<p>Wang also said Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party, which came into
power in 2016, has been “hellbent on the separatist stance” of Taiwan’s
independence and that Beijing has “sufficient reason and a solid legal
basis” to bar Taiwan from the global organization.</p>
<p>Here’s the bipartisan delegation that the White House is sending to
Taiwan this weekend:</p>
<p>— Laura Rosenberger, chair of the American Institute in Taiwan, a
nonprofit, private corporation established under a 1979 law to manage
America’s unofficial relations with Taiwan.</p>
<p>— Brian Deese, a former director of the National Economic Council in
the Biden administration.</p>
<p>— Richard Armitage, a former deputy secretary of state under
President George W. Bush.</p>
<p>— Richard Bush, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution who previously served as chair of the American Institute in
Taiwan.</p>

The consumer price index is up 3.4% in a year, and — setting aside
volatile food and fuels costs — the CPI increase over 12 months was the
lowest in three years. For people fervently hoping interest rates will
go down sooner rather than later, this is good news. But can there be
too much slowing? We dig in. Plus, we’ll hear how the economy of
Necoclí, Colombia, has shifted to serve migrants stopping there.

<p>This is not a joke: Google will now let you perform a “web” search.
It’s rolling out “web” searches now, and in my early tests on desktop,
it’s looking like it could be an incredibly popular change to Google’s
search engine. The optional setting filters out almost all the other
blocks of content that Google crams into a search results page, leaving
you with links and text — and Google confirms to The Verge that it will
block the company’s new AI Overviews as well. ↫ Sean Hollister at The

We already know that last summer was the hottest “on record” – but those
records only really go back to the 1850s or so. A new

published in the journal <em>Nature</em> looks further into the past and
concludes that last summer was the warmest in some 2,000 years in the
Northern Hemisphere. To reach this conclusion, researchers examined
thousands of tree rings, which
<a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/how-can-tree-rings-teach-us-about-climate?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">offer
clues</a> about a year’s temperature and moisture levels. The tree ring
data suggests last summer was about 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the
average temperature of the years 1 AD to 1890 AD. The study warns that
summer 2024 could be even warmer than 2023.

out yesterday concluded that Southeast Asia’s intense April heat wave
was fueled by man-caused climate change. In the Philippines, for
example, a 15-day heat wave pushed the heat index to 113 degrees
Fahrenheit, disrupting daily life and forcing many schools to close.
This extreme weather would have been “impossible” without climate
change, the study found.

<li>Trump chides Biden on new Chinese EV tariffs
</h3>
<p>
President Biden confirmed yesterday that he is imposing a 100% tariff on

clean energy technologies including lithium batteries, solar cells, and
critical minerals. Former President Trump, speaking from outside the New
York courtroom where his hush money trial is taking place,

“Where have they been for three-and-a-half years? They should have done
it a long time ago.”

<p>
There is no equivalence between Biden’ tariffs and the 10% across the
board tariff on all imported goods from all countries that Trump has
proposed,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/china-tariffs-biden-evs?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ" rel="noopener" target="_self">wrote
Heatmap’s Robinson Meyer</a>. “Biden’s new tariffs focus on certain
strategic sectors that American officials believe the country must
cultivate to stay at the technological frontier, coupled with
pre-existing subsidies meant to spur domestic production of those goods.
Some of the tariffs only kick in beginning in 2026 — far enough in the
future, policymakers hope, for the market to prepare. Trump’s tariffs,
meanwhile, would intentionally and chaotically hike prices.”

Plug Power a conditional commitment of $1.66 billion in loan guarantees
to build up to six clean hydrogen plants that use the company’s
electrolyzer technology. The hydrogen would “power fuel cell-electric
vehicles used in the material handling, transportation, and industrial
sectors, resulting in an estimated 84% reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions compared to conventional hydrogen production,” the DOE
announcement said. Most hydrogen production uses fossil fuels to run an
electrolyzer that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. But clean
hydrogen relies on electrolyzers powered by renewable sources – or
natural gas with carbon capture. The Biden administration sees clean
hydrogen as a key part of its push to decarbonize heavy industry. The
deal isn’t done yet – Plug will have to prove its projects will benefit
local communities and “satisfy certain technical, legal, environmental,

In case you missed it earlier this week (I did!), officials in

The Cloud Aerosol Research Instrument, or CARI, sits on the flight deck
of the Hornet, a decommissioned aircraft carrier in Alameda, California.
It sprays sea salt aerosol particles into the air, a process that could
one day be used to brighten clouds and reflect the sun’s rays. This
experiment, which began in early April, marked the first time such a
device had been tested outdoors in the U.S. But the city of Alameda told
the scientists to stop their research until the health and environmental
impacts of the experiment can be evaluated. “The city is evaluating the
chemical compounds in the spray to determine if they are a hazard either
inhaled in aerosol form by humans and animals, or landing on the ground
or in the bay,” city officials said.

migration changed the economy of a Colombian town</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
<em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Roughly 500,000 migrants traveled
through dense jungles on the Colombia-Panama border last year, according
to the United Nations. We’ll hear how businesses in a beach town have
shifted their focus to cater to the new arrivals. Plus, China vowed to
retaliate against President Biden’s significant tariffs on some Chinese
imports. Meanwhile, Russia’s President Putin spoke of his country’s
close ties to China ahead of a visit to Beijing.

poodle Sage fetches top prize at Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — A sprightly miniature poodle named Sage was crowned “Best
in Show” on Tuesday at the 148th annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog
Show, winning the grand prize in the most prestigious competition among
pure-bred canines in the United States.</p>
<p>Sage, the finalist representing 21 breeds classified as non-sporting
dogs, triumphed over more than 2,500 top-ranked dogs competing in the
two-day contest, held at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis
Center in the Queens borough of New York City.</p>
<p>Sage, a 4-year-old black-colored female groomed in the fine, fluffy
topiary style traditional for poodles, competed head to head against the
winners in six other groups — terriers, hounds, herding dogs, working
dogs, sporting dogs and toy dogs.</p>
<p>She was the first female to win the top prize at Westminster since
2020, according to commentators on the Fox Sports channel, which
broadcast the event live.</p>
<p>And she became the fourth miniature poodle to claim the top prize in
the 148-year history of the contest, with the trophy previously going to
her breed in 1943, 1959 and 2002, according to kennel club records.</p>
<p>The larger “standard” poodle breed has been declared Best in Show
five times, most recently in 2020, and the smaller “toy” poodle breed
has won twice.</p>
<p>The poodle originated as a hunting dog in Germany and is now
recognized as the national dog of France.</p>
<p>Sage’s handler, Kaz Hosaka, cried tears of joy and carried his prized
poodle in his arms around floor of the auditorium to cheers of the crowd
as he celebrated what he said was his 45th year participating at the
Westminster dog show and the last of his career.</p>
<p>The Westminster dog show bills itself as the second-oldest U.S.
sporting event, behind only the Kentucky Derby thoroughbred horse race.
This year’s competition drew a field of contenders representing 200
breeds from all 50 U.S. states and 12 other countries.</p>
<p>Mercedes, a female 4-year-old German shepherd, was named runner-up
for the overall contest, after first winning the top prize in the
herding dog group.</p>
<p>Along with Sage and Mercedes, the two other finalists chosen on
Monday were Comet the Shih Tzu, representing the toy group, and Louis,
the Afghan hound leading the hound group.</p>
<p>Rounding out the finalists were three group winners chosen on Tuesday
- Micah the black cocker spaniel, representing sporting dogs; Monty, the
giant schnauzer, leading the working dogs; and Frankie, a colored bull
terrier from the terrier group.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Transmission has been one of the biggest obstacles of decarbonizing the
power grid in America. In the past week, however, the country has taken
two big steps toward finally removing it.
</p>
<p>
Last week, the Department of Energy published a list of 10 high-priority
areas for grid development, called National Interest Electric
Transmission Corridors, designed to help accelerate some of the most
annoying aspects of the siting process. Then on Monday, the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission passed a new rule directing grid planners
to take a longer view on what America’s future electricity needs will
look like.
</p>
<p>
On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse talk with two special
guests —
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/gdo/person/maria-robinson" target="_blank">Maria
Robinson</a>, who leads the Energy Department’s Grid Deployment Office,
and Heatmap reporter
<a href="https://heatmap.news/u/matthewzeitlin" target="_blank">Matthew
Zeitlin</a> — about what these measures mean for the Biden
administration’s climate policy and how soon we might see new power
lines get built. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding
executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy
systems engineering at Princeton University.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer:</strong> Wow. Okay. So basically, any — so can I
just back up for a second? I think, first of all, I just want to go:
Wow. So all of, the whole power we’re talking about today is very
important. There’s nothing else like it in the federal government. But
also, you’re going to have to do a whole NEPA process on it?<br/> <br/>
<strong>Maria Robinson:</strong> Yes, so we’re going to have to do a
whole NEPA process for each one of these areas that we’re designating
for NIETCs. And then the other part of this is that if they access some
funding, they’re going to have to do another NEPA process. And if they
access backstop siting at a FERC, you may have to do another NEPA
process. And I know Congress is investigating a couple of remedies to
that.<br/> <br/> <strong>Jesse Jenkins:</strong> So that’s pretty
important. Because the goal here is to try to accelerate the development
of transmission, which is critical to tap into the best wind and solar
resources across the country that can help lower electricity costs and
help decarbonize the grid to meet the growing need for electricity.
That’s coming from data centers, as listeners have heard here on Shift
Key, from electrification of vehicles, hydrogen production, etc. So
we’ve got a big pressure to increase the electricity supply in the
country. And, you know, the cheapest resources are renewables, but we’ve
got to be able to plug them into the grid.<br/> <br/> So if this process
is going to … designating these NIETCs and then ultimately getting
transmission lines built out within them, with access to federal support
for financing and backstop siting authority, is going to play out over a
multi-year NEPA process — or several of them — how quickly could we
realistically expect to start seeing transmission lines built within
some of these corridors?<br/> <br/> <strong>Maria Robinson:</strong>
What’s great about the cohort — and this is just our very first cohort
of those named national transmission corridors. We anticipate that we’ll
open up applications again, maybe as soon as this fall, for another
round, as well, depending on how many we move forward with to do full
NEPA on. It really depends on our ability to get all of that NEPA done.
<br/> <br/> But some of these are really ready for prime time. Some of
them are just looking for some additional financing. And are looking at
construction dates as soon as, say, 2028, 2029, which in the grand
scheme of things for transmission is relatively soon.

id="administration-sending-1-billion-more-in-weapons-to-israel-sources-say">Administration
sending $1 billion more in weapons to Israel, sources say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Biden administration has told key lawmakers it is
sending a new package of more than $1 billion in arms and ammunition to
Israel, three congressional aides said Tuesday.</p>
<p>It’s the first arms shipment to Israel to be announced by the
administration since it put another arms transfer — consisting of 3,500
bombs — on hold this month. The administration has said it paused that
earlier transfer to keep Israel from using the bombs in its growing
offensive in the crowded southern Gaza city of Rafah.</p>
<p>The White House has come under criticism from both sides of the
political spectrum in the U.S. over its military support for Israel’s
now seven-month war against Hamas in Gaza. Some of President Joe Biden’s
fellow Democrats have pushed him to limit transfers of offensive weapons
to Israel to pressure the U.S. ally to do more to protect Palestinian
civilians. Many Republicans condemn any lessening of military backing to
Israel.</p>
<p>The package being sent includes about $700 million for tank
ammunition, $500 million in tactical vehicles and $60 million in mortar
rounds, the congressional aides said. They spoke on condition of
anonymity to discuss an arms transfer that has not yet been made
public.</p>
<p>There was no immediate indication when the arms would be sent. It’s
not clear if this shipment is part of the long-delayed foreign aid
package that Congress passed and Biden signed last month, a tranche from
existing arms sale or a new sale.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal first reported the plans to move the
package.</p>
<p>House Republicans were planning this week to advance a bill to
mandate the delivery of offensive weaponry for Israel. Following Biden’s
move to put a pause on bomb shipments last week, Republicans have been
swift in their condemnation, arguing it represents the abandonment of
the closest U.S. ally in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The White House said Tuesday that Biden would veto the bill if it
were to pass Congress. The bill also has practically no chance in the
Democratic-controlled Senate. But House Democrats are somewhat divided
on the issue, and roughly two dozen have signed onto a letter to the
Biden administration saying they were “deeply concerned about the
message” sent by pausing the bomb shipment.</p>
<p>In addition to the written veto threat, the White House has been in
touch with various lawmakers and congressional aides about the
legislation, according to an administration official.</p>
<p>“We strongly, strongly oppose attempts to constrain the President’s
ability to deploy U.S. security assistance consistent with U.S. foreign
policy and national security objectives,” White House press secretary
Karine Jean-Pierre said this week, adding that the administration plans
to spend “every last cent” appropriated by Congress in the national
security supplemental package that was signed into law by Biden last
month.</p>

id="republicans-advance-senate-candidates-in-west-virginia-maryland">Republicans
advance Senate candidates in West Virginia, Maryland</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ANNAPOLIS, Md. — Republican voters advanced strong Senate contenders
in Maryland and West Virginia on Tuesday, giving the party a big boost
in its push to claim control of Congress’ upper chamber.</p>
<p>Former Governor Larry Hogan claimed the Republican nomination in what
will be a marquee race in Maryland against Angela Alsobrooks, a top
local official who could become the fourth Black woman in U.S. history
to serve in the Senate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another popular Republican, Governor Jim Justice, won the
Senate nomination in deep-red West Virginia, becoming the overwhelming
favorite in the race that represents the Republicans’ best pickup
opportunity in the nation.</p>
<p>In both states, which share a border but feature antithetical
politics, the Republican nominees represent a serious challenge for
Democrats in the general election as they cling to a 51-49 Senate
majority and defend seats in other states that former President Donald
Trump won four years ago.</p>
<p>At the same time, Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden sought to
project strength in low-stakes presidential primaries. And further down
the ballot, two people who were on opposite sides of the Jan. 6
insurrection lost their U.S. House bids — a former Capitol Police
officer running in Maryland and a former West Virginia state lawmaker
who participated in the riot.</p>
<p>In all, three states hosted statewide primary elections Tuesday —
Maryland, Nebraska and West Virginia — as Republicans and Democrats
picked their nominees for a slate of November elections that will decide
the presidency and control of Congress.</p>
<p>Maryland</p>
<p>In Maryland, Hogan gives Republicans a legitimate chance at picking
up a Senate seat in the deep-blue state for the first time in more than
four decades.</p>
<p>Hogan overcame his years-long criticism of Trump, a position that put
him at odds with many Republican primary voters but will undoubtedly
help him in the general election this fall. Maryland voters gave Biden a
33-point victory over Trump four years ago.</p>
<p>On the other side in the Senate contest, Democratic voters nominated
Alsobrooks, the top official in Prince George’s County outside of
Washington. The 53-year-old African American county executive had been
endorsed by many of the state’s top officials, including Governor Wes
Moore, Senator Chris Van Hollen and U.S. Representative Steny Hoyer.</p>
<p>Alsobrooks prevailed after a contentious and expensive primary
against U.S. Representative David Trone, a liquor store magnate who had
invested more than $61 million into his unsuccessful bid.</p>
<p>Race was an issue in the Democratic primary and may be in the general
election in the months ahead. Alsobrooks is trying to become the first
Black senator from a state in which roughly one in three residents
identifies as African American.</p>
<p>On the social media site X, Hogan congratulated Alsobrooks and said,
“Voters have a clear and stark choice: more of the dysfunctional
partisan status quo or real independent and bipartisan leadership.”</p>
<p>Alsobrooks, also posting on X, promised to “defeat Larry Hogan, keep
Maryland blue, and keep our Senate under Democratic control.”</p>
<p>West Virginia</p>
<p>Justice won his primary against U.S. Representative Alex Mooney in
the race to replace Senator Joe Manchin. With Manchin gone, the seat is
almost guaranteed to turn red come November.</p>
<p>Justice, a former billionaire with a folksy personality, is wildly
popular in the state. He also earned Trump’s endorsement. A former
Democrat, Justice switched to the Republican Party in 2017, announcing
the change at a Trump rally.</p>
<p>Mooney had tried to win over conservatives by labeling Justice as
someone who would support Democratic policies. Justice did support
Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure law, saying West Virginia couldn’t
afford to turn away the money offered in the bill.</p>
<p>West Virginia is also deciding its candidates for governor. Attorney
General Patrick Morrisey, the Republican nominee in the 2018 Senate race
against Manchin, is running for the Republican nomination. He’s up
against former state Representative Moore Capito, whose mother is
Senator Shelley Moore Capito.</p>
<p>Presidential primary</p>
<p>Biden and Trump have already amassed enough delegates to claim the
presidential nominations at their respective national conventions this
summer. Yet voters on both sides hope to register a significant protest
vote Tuesday that will demonstrate their dissatisfaction with the
Biden-Trump rematch.</p>
<p>Both Biden and Trump won their primaries in West Virginia and
Maryland.</p>
<p>Still, Maryland progressives especially unhappy with the Biden
administration’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas had
encouraged voters to select “uncommitted to any presidential candidate”
instead of Biden. There was no uncommitted option in West Virginia or
Nebraska.</p>
<p>Everett Bellamy, a Democrat who voted early in Annapolis, said he
voted “uncommitted” instead of Biden as a protest against the killing of
women and children and noncombatants in Gaza.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Trump’s Republican critics cannot choose “uncommitted,”
but they can choose his former Republican rival Nikki Haley, who will
appear on the ballot in Maryland, Nebraska and West Virginia despite
formally suspending her campaign more than two months ago.</p>
<p>Derek Faux, an independent voter from Charleston, West Virginia, said
he supported Haley, and in other Republican races, he said he voted for
the candidates he believed were least like Trump.</p>
<p>Capitol attack</p>
<p>Tuesday’s elections also included two candidates who were intimately
involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>In Maryland, former Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn was among
nearly two dozen Democrats running in the state’s 3rd Congressional
District. The 40-year-old Democrat lost to State Senator Sarah
Elfreth.</p>
<p>In West Virginia, a former member of the House of Delegates, Derrick
Evans, lost his bid to oust incumbent Republican Representative Carol
Miller in the 1st Congressional District.</p>
<p>The 39-year-old Evans served a three-month jail sentence after
livestreaming himself participating in the storming of the U.S.
Capitol.</p>
<p>Other key races</p>
<p>In Nebraska, Republican Senators Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts both
face nominal opposition in their primaries, one of the rare occasions
when both senators in a state are on the ballot at the same time. And in
Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District, Republican U.S. Representative
Don Bacon faces a challenge from his right flank.</p>
<p>In North Carolina, voters finalized their pick of the Trump-endorsed
Brad Knott in what had become a one-person Republican primary in the
state’s 13th Congressional District.</p>

<h2
id="justice-department-says-boeing-could-be-prosecuted-in-737-max-crashes">Justice
Department says Boeing could be prosecuted in 737 Max crashes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Boeing has violated a settlement that allowed the
company to avoid criminal prosecution after two deadly crashes involving
its 737 Max aircraft more than five years ago, the Justice Department
told a federal judge on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It is now up to the Justice Department to decide whether to file
charges against Boeing. Prosecutors will tell the court no later than
July 7 how they plan to proceed, the department said.</p>
<p>New 737 Max jets crashed in 2018 in Indonesia and 2019 in Ethiopia,
killing 346 people. Boeing reached a $2.5 billion settlement with the
Justice Department in January 2021 to avoid prosecution on a single
charge of fraud — misleading federal regulators who approved the plane.
Boeing blamed the deception on two relatively low-level employees.</p>
<p>In a letter filed Tuesday in federal court in Texas, Glenn Leon, head
of the Justice Department criminal division’s fraud section, said Boeing
violated terms of the settlement by failing to make promised changes to
detect and prevent violations of federal anti-fraud laws.</p>
<p>The determination means that Boeing could be prosecuted “for any
federal criminal violation of which the United States has knowledge,”
including the charge of fraud that the company hoped to avoid with the
settlement, the Justice Department said.</p>
<p>However, it is not clear whether the government will prosecute
Boeing.</p>
<p>“The Government is determining how it will proceed in this matter,”
the Justice Department said in the court filing. Boeing will have until
June 13 to respond to the government’s allegation, and department said
it will consider the company’s explanation “in determining whether to
pursue prosecution.”</p>
<p>Boeing Co., which is based in Arlington, Virginia, disputed the
Justice Department’s finding.</p>
<p>“We believe that we have honored the terms of that agreement, and
look forward to the opportunity to respond to the Department on this
issue,” a Boeing spokesperson said in a statement. “As we do so, we will
engage with the Department with the utmost transparency, as we have
throughout the entire term of the agreement, including in response to
their questions following the Alaska Airlines 1282 accident.”</p>
<p>Boeing has come under renewed scrutiny since that Alaska Airlines
flight in January, when a door plug blew out of a 737 Max, leaving a
gaping hole in the side of the jetliner. The company is under multiple
investigations into the blowout and its manufacturing quality. The FBI
has told passengers from the flight that they might be victims of a
crime.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said they will meet on May 31 with families of passengers
who died in the two Max crashes. Family members were angry and
disappointed after a similar meeting last month.</p>
<p>Paul Cassell, a lawyer who represents families of passengers in the
second crash, said the Justice Department’s determination that Boeing
breached the settlement terms is “a positive first step, and for the
families, a long time coming.”</p>
<p>“But we need to see further action from DOJ to hold Boeing
accountable, and plan to use our meeting on May 31 to explain in more
details what we believe would be a satisfactory remedy to Boeing’s
ongoing criminal conduct,” Cassell said.</p>
<p>Investigations into the crashes pointed to a flight-control system
that Boeing added to the Max without telling pilots or airlines. Boeing
downplayed the significance of the system, then didn’t overhaul it until
after the second crash.</p>
<p>After secret negotiations, the government agreed not to prosecute
Boeing on a charge of defrauding the United States by deceiving
regulators about the flight system. The settlement included a $243.6
million fine, a $500 million fund for victim compensation, and nearly
$1.8 billion to airlines whose Max jets were grounded for nearly two
years.</p>
