id="exclusive-us-confirms-iran-will-run-absentee-ballot-stations-in-us">Exclusive:
US confirms Iran will run absentee ballot stations in US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The Biden administration will again allow Iran to run
absentee voter stations on U.S. soil for next week’s Iranian
presidential election, VOA has learned, prompting the Islamic republic’s
critics to denounce the plan as absurd and shameful.</p>
<p>Iranian Foreign Ministry official Alireza Mahmoudi told state media
on Sunday that Tehran is planning to set up more than 30 ballot stations
across the United States for the June 28 vote to replace Iranian
President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash last month.</p>
<p>Mahmoudi said ballot boxes for Iranian absentee voters would be set
up at the Iranian Interests Section of the Pakistani embassy in
Washington and in New York but did not identify other locations.</p>
<p>Iranian state media say the United States is home to the largest
proportion of overseas-based Iranians at 30%. The U.S. Census Bureau’s
American Community Survey estimates there are about half a million
people born in Iran or of Iranian origin in the U.S., while the Iranian
American nonprofit group National Union for Democracy in Iran, or NUFDI,
says it has a higher estimate of more than 1 million.</p>
<p>Canada and Turkey follow with 12% shares of the Iranian diaspora,
according to Iranian state media. Mahmoudi said Iran is arranging
absentee voting in other diaspora locations as well.</p>
<p>In a statement reported exclusively by VOA, the U.S. State Department
said on Friday it has no expectation that Iran’s presidential election
will be free or fair. The Islamic republic’s ruling clerics permit only
loyalists of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to run for offices
such as president and parliament, which are subservient to him on key
policy issues.</p>
<p>Iran’s last parliamentary and presidential elections, in March and
2021, respectively, drew record-low official turnouts, with the lack of
choices leaving much of the electorate disinterested.</p>
<p>Opponents of Iran’s clerical rulers at home and abroad repeatedly
have called for boycotts of Iranian elections, which they view as shams,
and they have done so again for the June 28 vote. They also have noted
that the Islamic republic seeks legitimacy for its 45-year authoritarian
rule by trying to boost turnout for such elections.</p>
<p>VOA asked the State Department how authorizing ballot stations in the
U.S. for Iran, whose poor human rights record it has strongly
criticized, is consistent with the U.S. view of Iranian elections as
neither free nor fair.</p>
<p>A spokesperson responded by noting that Iran set up U.S.-based ballot
stations for previous presidential elections, in 2021 and 2017, with
approval from the Biden administration and its predecessor, the Trump
administration, respectively.</p>
<p>“This is nothing new,” the spokesman said, in reference to the
planned ballot stations for next week’s vote.</p>
<p>Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser to the Washington-based Foundation
for Defense of Democracies, countered that permitting Iran to engage in
another round of absentee balloting on U.S. soil is a “theater of the
absurd.”</p>
<p>In a statement to VOA, Goldberg wrote: “How and why we would
facilitate such a charade for a state sponsor of terrorism that is
hunting Americans every day is beyond me.” He also questioned who would
be operating Iran’s ballot stations in the U.S. and what relationship
they have to the Iranian government.</p>
<p>VOA put those questions to Iran’s U.N. mission, which responded by
saying it declines to comment because it “believes the issue is not of
interest to an American audience.”</p>
<p>A day before Iran’s 2021 presidential election, the Iranian Interests
Section in Washington published an online chart showing the addresses of
ballot stations in 29 U.S. cities where Iranian citizens could vote.
Besides the Interests Section, the other listed venues included 20
properties of U.S. and British hotel companies and eight Islamic
centers. There was no indication of who operated the stations.</p>
<p>VOA contacted three hotels that hosted the 2021 ballot stations on
Friday to ask if they were planning to host such stations again next
week. Staff members who answered the phones at the Marriott Spring Hill
Suites in Gaithersburg, Maryland, and at the Hilton Garden Inn
Irvine-Orange County Airport in California said they had no record of
such events on their schedules. A woman who answered the phone at the
Comfort Inn Sandy Springs in Atlanta, Georgia, repeatedly hung up when
asked if it is hosting an event next Friday.</p>
<p>Cameron Khansarinia, vice president of the Iranian American group
NUFDI, told VOA that diaspora Iranians have a responsibility to protest
the Islamic republic’s “shameful” absentee voter stations wherever they
are set up.</p>
<p>In reference to those who operate and vote at the planned ballot
stations, Khansarinia said, “While we should respect the physical safety
of these individuals and U.S. law, they deserve to be publicly shamed
for their absolutely amorality.”</p>
<p>VOA also asked the State Department whether U.S. authorities have
granted licenses to businesses and nonprofit groups that plan to host
the Iranian ballot stations to exempt them from U.S. sanctions that
generally prohibit the provision of commercial services to Iran.</p>
<p>The spokesperson replied, “Foreign governments carrying out
election-related activities in the U.S. must do so in a manner
consistent with U.S. law and regulations.”</p>
<p>The Treasury Department did not respond to similar questions sent by
VOA on Tuesday, regarding the granting of licenses for Iranian ballot
stations.</p>
<p>Brian O’Toole, a former senior adviser in the Treasury Department’s
Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, told VOA it is a gray
area.</p>
<p>O’Toole, a nonresident senior fellow at the Washington-based Atlantic
Council, identified two U.S. regulations, OFAC’s General License E and
the Code of Federal Regulations section 560.545, as potentially
permitting election activity and democracy-building in Iran.</p>
<p>“Despite the Iranian government’s issues with elections, the U.S. has
a clear interest in promoting democracy,” said O’Toole, who managed
OFAC’s sanctions program during former President Barack Obama’s
administration.</p>
<p>“What this administration probably would lean toward is the principle
that people who are eligible to vote [in Iran’s election] should make
the decision as to whether they should or should not,” he said.</p>

rain, flash flooding prompt evacuations in New Mexico</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LAS VEGAS, NEW MEXICO — Heavy rain and flash flood warnings in the
U.S. state of New Mexico prompted officials to order mandatory
evacuations Saturday, with shelters set up for displaced residents.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service announced a flash flood emergency on
Friday night through early Saturday. The impacted areas included the
city of Las Vegas and communities near Albuquerque.</p>
<p>Up to 5 centimeters (2 inches) of rain had fallen by late Friday,
with additional rainfall up to 3.8 centimeters (1.5 inches) expected
overnight, the weather service said.</p>
<p>There was flash flooding with multiple road closures on the north and
west sides of Las Vegas, the weather service said.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas municipal government announced mandatory evacuations of
parts of the city in social media posts, warning residents to prepare
for overnight stays. The city said it established shelters for residents
on the west and east sides of the city.</p>
<p>The city government asked residents to limit nonessential water use,
while also clarifying that online rumors suggesting the city’s dams had
broken were false and that the dams “are currently intact.”</p>
<p>New Mexico also suffered devastating wildfires this week that killed
at least two people and forced thousands to flee from the flames. The
South Fork and Salt fires in south-central New Mexico destroyed or
damaged an estimated 1,400 structures. FEMA Administrator Deanne
Criswell and New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham planned to tour
the disaster area Saturday.</p>

aircraft carrier arrives in South Korea as show of force against
North</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SEOUL, South Korea — A nuclear-powered United States aircraft carrier
arrived Saturday in South Korea for a three-way exercise stepping up
their military training to cope with North Korean threats that escalated
with its alignment with Russia.</p>
<p>The arrival of the USS Theodore Roosevelt strike group in Busan came
a day after South Korea summoned the Russian ambassador to protest a
pact reached between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean
leader Kim Jong Un this week that pledges mutual defense assistance in
the event of war. South Korea says the deal poses a threat to its
security and warned that it could consider sending arms to Ukraine to
help fight off the Russian invasion as a response — a move that would
surely ruin its relations with Moscow.</p>
<p>Following a meeting between their defense chiefs in Singapore earlier
in June, the United States, South Korea and Japan announced Freedom
Edge. The new multidomain exercise is aimed at sharpening the countries’
combined response in various areas of operation, including air, sea and
cyberspace.</p>
<p>The Theodore Roosevelt strike group will participate in the exercise
that is expected to start within June. South Korea’s military didn’t
immediately confirm specific details of the training.</p>
<p>South Korea’s navy said in a statement that the arrival of
the Theodore Roosevelt demonstrates the strong defense posture of the
allies and “stern willingness to respond to advancing North Korean
threats.” The carrier’s visit comes seven months after another U.S.
aircraft carrier, the USS Carl Vinson, came to South Korea in a show of
strength against the North.</p>
<p>The Theodore Roosevelt strike group also participated in a three-way
exercise with South Korean and Japanese naval forces in April in the
disputed East China Sea, where worries about China’s territorial claims
are rising.</p>
<p>In the face of growing North Korean threats, the United States, South
Korea and Japan have expanded their combined training and boosted the
visibility of strategic U.S. military assets in the region, seeking to
intimidate the North. The United States and South Korea have also been
updating their nuclear deterrence strategies, with Seoul seeking
stronger assurances that Washington would swiftly and decisively use its
nuclear capabilities to defend its ally from a North Korean nuclear
attack.</p>

id="after-mass-killings-complex-question-follows-demolish-or-press-on">After
mass killings, complex question follows: Demolish, or press on?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PITTSBURGH — Last week in Parkland, Florida, wrecking equipment began
demolishing the building at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School where a
gunman’s rampage in 2018 ended with 17 people dead. As the rumble of
destruction echoed, people in the community set to explaining exactly
why ripping the building down was so meaningful — and so crucial.</p>
<p>From former student Bryan Lequerique: “It’s something that we all
need. It’s time to bring an end to this very hurtful chapter in
everyone’s lives.” And Eric Garner, a broadcasting and film teacher,
said: “For 6½ years we have been looking at this monument to mass murder
that has been on campus every day. … So coming down, that’s the
monumental event.”</p>
<p>Parkland. Uvalde. Columbine. Sandy Hook. A supermarket in Buffalo. A
church in South Carolina. A synagogue in Pittsburgh. A nightclub in
Orlando, Florida. When violence comes to a public place, as it does all
too often in our era, a delicate question lingers in the quiet
afterward: What should be done with the buildings where blood was shed,
where lives were upended, where loved ones were lost forever?</p>
<p>Which is the appropriate choice — the defiance of keeping them
standing, or the deep comfort that can come with wiping them off the
map? Is it best to keep pain right in front of us, or at a distance?</p>
<p>How different communities have approached the problem</p>
<p>This question has been answered differently over the years.</p>
<p>The most obvious example in recent history is the decision to
preserve the concentration camps run by Nazi Germany during World War II
where millions of Jews and others died — an approach consistent with the
post-Holocaust mantras of “never forget” and “never again.” But that was
an event of global significance, with meaning for both the descendants
of survivors and the public at large.</p>
<p>For individual American communities, approaches have varied. Parkland
and others chose demolition. In Pittsburgh, the Tree of Life synagogue,
site of a 2018 shooting, was torn down to make way for a new sanctuary
and memorial.</p>
<p>But the Tops Friendly Markets in Buffalo, New York, and the Emanuel
African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, where
racist mass shootings happened, both reopened. And Columbine High School
still stands, though its library, where so much bloodshed occurred, was
replaced after much impassioned debate. “Finding a balance between its
function as a high school and the need for memorialization has been a
long process,” former student Riley Burkhart wrote earlier this year in
an essay.</p>
<p>What goes into these decisions? Not only emotion and heartbreak.
Sometimes it’s simply a question of resources; not all school districts
can afford to demolish and rebuild. Sometimes it’s about not wanting to
give those who might support the shooter a place to focus their
attention.</p>
<p>“Denying such opportunities for those who celebrate the persecution
and deaths of those different from themselves is a perfectly sound
reason to tear down buildings where mass killings occurred,” Daniel
Fountain, a professor of history at Meredith College in North Carolina,
said in a email.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most significant driving force, though, is the increasing
discussion in recent years about the role of mental health.</p>
<p>“There are changing norms about things like trauma and closure that
are at play that today encourage the notion of demolishing these
spaces,” said Timothy Recuber, a sociologist at Smith College in
Massachusetts and author of “Consuming Catastrophe: Mass Culture in
America’s Decade of Disaster.”</p>
<p>For many years, he said, “the prevailing idea of how to get past a
tragedy was to put your head down and push past it. Today, people are
more likely to believe that having to return to the scene of the crime,
so to speak, is liable to re-inflict harm.”</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood, a fence masks the site
where the Tree of Life synagogue stood until it was razed earlier this
year, more than five years after a gunman killed 11 people in the
deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history.</p>
<p>David Michael Slater grew up across the street from the synagogue. He
understands the ambivalence that can come with choosing whether to knock
down.</p>
<p>“It’s easy to see why decision-makers might have chosen one path or
the other. And to me, it seems presumptuous for anyone not part of, or
directly affected by, the choice to quibble with it,” said Slater, who
retired this month after 30 years of teaching middle and high school
English. “That said, the decision to demolish such sites, when seen in
the context of our escalating culture of erasure, should raise
concern.”</p>
<p>The power of memory cuts both ways</p>
<p>From World War II to 9/11, the politics of American memory are
powerful — and nowhere more intricate than in the case of mass
shootings. The loss of loved ones, societal disagreements over gun laws
and differing approaches to protecting children create a landscape where
the smallest of issues can give rise to dozens of passionate and angry
opinions.</p>
<p>To some, keeping a building standing is the ultimate defiance: You
are not bowing to horror nor capitulating to those who caused it. You
are choosing to continue in the face of unimaginable circumstances — a
robust thread in the American narrative.</p>
<p>To others, the possibility of being retraumatized is central. Why,
the thinking goes, should a building where people met violent ends
continue to be a looming — literally — force in the lives of those who
must go on?</p>
<p>It stands to reason, then, that a key factor in deciding the fates of
such buildings coalesces around one question: Who is the audience?</p>
<p>“It’s not a simple choice of should we knock it down or renovate or
let it be,” said Jennifer Talarico, a psychology professor at Lafayette
College in Pennsylvania who studies how people form personal memories of
public events.</p>
<p>“If we’re interested in the memories of the people who directly
experienced the event, that physical space will serve as a specific and
powerful reminder. But if we’re talking about remembering or
commemorating an event for other people, those who did not experience
it, that’s a slightly different calculus,” Talarico said. “Remembering
and forgetting are both powerful forces.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, of course, there is a middle ground: eliminating the
building itself but erecting a lasting memorial to those who were lost,
as Uvalde and other communities have chosen. In that way, the virtues of
mental health and memory can both be honored. Life can go on — not
obliviously, but not impeded by a daily, visceral reminder of the
heartbreak that once visited.</p>
<p>That approach sits well with Slater, who has contemplated such
tragedies both from the standpoint of his hometown synagogue and the
classrooms where he spent decades teaching and keeping kids safe.</p>
<p>“Like every problem in life that matters, simple answers are hard to
come by,” Slater said. “If what replaces the Tree of Life, or Parkland,
or the next defiled place of worship or learning or commerce, can be
made to serve both as proof of our indomitable spirit and as
memorialized evidence of what we strive to overcome, perhaps we can have
the best of both worst worlds.”</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HOUSTON, TEXAS — Hundreds of thousands of immigrants had reason to
rejoice when U.S. President Joe Biden unveiled a highly expansive plan
to extend legal status to spouses of U.S. citizens, but, inevitably,
some were left out.</p>
<p>Claudia Zuniga, 35, married in 2017, which was 10 years after her
husband came to the United States. He moved to Ciudad Juarez, Mexico,
after they wed, knowing that, by law, he had to live outside the country
for years to gain legal status. “Our lives took a 180-degree turn,” she
said.</p>
<p>Biden announced Tuesday that his administration will, in coming
months, allow U.S. citizens’ spouses without legal status to apply for
permanent residency and eventually citizenship without having to first
depart the country for up to 10 years. Some 500,000 immigrants may
benefit, according to senior administration officials.</p>
<p>To qualify, an immigrant must have lived in the United States for 10
years and be married to a U.S. citizen, both as of Monday. Zuniga’s
husband is ineligible because he wasn’t in the United States.</p>
<p>“Imagine, it would be a dream come true,” said Zuniga, who works part
time in her father’s transportation business in Houston. “My husband
could be with us. We could focus on the well-being of our children.”</p>
<p>Every immigration benefit — even those as sweeping as Biden’s
election-year offer — has a cutoff date and other eligibility
requirements. In September, the Democratic president expanded temporary
status for nearly 500,000 Venezuelans who were living in the United
States on July 31, 2023. Those who had arrived a day later were out of
luck.</p>
<p>The Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which
has shielded from deportation hundreds of thousands of people who came
to the United States as young children and is popularly known as DACA,
required applicants be in the United States on June 15, 2012, and
continuously for the previous five years.</p>
<p>About 1.1 million spouses who are in the country illegally are
married to U.S. citizens, according to advocacy group FWD.us., meaning
hundreds of thousands won’t qualify because they were in the United
States for less than 10 years.</p>
<p>Immigration advocates were generally thrilled with the scope of
Tuesday’s announcement, just as Biden’s critics called it a horribly
misguided giveaway.</p>
<p>Angelica Martinez, 36, wiped away tears as she sat next to her
children, ages 14 and 6, and watched Biden’s announcement at the Houston
office of FIEL, an immigrant advocacy group. A U.S. citizen since 2013,
she described a flood of emotions, including regret that her husband
couldn’t travel to Mexico when his mother died five years ago.</p>
<p>“Sadness, joy all at the same time,” said Martinez, whose husband
arrived in Houston 18 years ago.</p>
<p>Brenda Valle of Los Angeles, whose husband has been a U.S. citizen
since 2001 and, like her, was born in Mexico, renews her DACA permit
every two years. “We can start planning more long-term for the future
instead of what we can do for the next two years,” she said.</p>
<p>Magdalena Gutierrez of Chicago, who has been married to a U.S.
citizen for 22 years and has three daughters who are U.S. citizens, said
she had “a little more hope” after Biden’s announcement. Gutierrez, 43,
is eager to travel more across the United States without fearing an
encounter with law enforcement could lead to her being deported.</p>
<p>Allyson Batista, a retired Philadelphia teacher and U.S. citizen who
married her Brazilian husband 20 years ago, recalled being told by a
lawyer that he could leave the country for 10 years or “remain in the
shadows and wait for a change in the law.”</p>
<p>“Initially, when we got married, I was naive and thought, ‘OK, but
I’m American. This isn’t going to be a problem. We’re going to fix
this,’” Batista said. “I learned very early on that we were facing a
pretty dire circumstance and that there would be no way for us to move
forward in an immigration process successfully.”</p>
<p>The couple raised three children who are pursuing higher education.
Batista is waiting for the details of how her husband can apply for a
green card.</p>
<p>“I’m hopeful,” Batista said. “The next 60 days will really tell. But,
obviously, more than thrilled because every step forward is a step
toward a final resolution for all kinds of immigrant families.”</p>
<p>About 50,000 noncitizen children with parents who are married to a
U.S. citizen could also potentially qualify, according to senior
administration officials who briefed reporters on the condition of
anonymity. Biden also announced new regulations that will allow some
DACA beneficiaries and other young immigrants to more easily qualify for
long-established work visas.</p>

id="trump-departs-from-anti-immigrant-rhetoric-with-green-card-proposal">Trump
departs from anti-immigrant rhetoric with green card proposal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Miami, florida — Former President Donald Trump said in an interview
posted Thursday he wants to give automatic green cards to foreign
students who graduate from U.S. colleges, a sharp departure from the
anti-immigrant rhetoric he typically uses on the campaign trail.</p>
<p>Trump was asked about plans for companies to be able to import the
“best and brightest” in a podcast taped Wednesday with venture
capitalists and tech investors called the “All-In.”</p>
<p>“What I want to do, and what I will do is, you graduate from a
college, I think you should get automatically as part of your diploma a
green card to be able to stay in this country. And that includes junior
colleges, too, anybody graduates from a college. You go there for two
years or four years,” he said, vowing to address this concern on day one
if he is elected president in November.</p>
<p>Immigration has been Trump’s signature issue during his 2024 bid to
return to the White House. His suggestion that he would offer green
cards — documents that confer a pathway to U.S. citizenship — to
potentially hundreds of thousands of foreign graduates would represent a
sweeping expansion of America’s immigration system that sharply diverges
from his most common messages on foreigners.</p>
<p>Trump often says during his rallies that immigrants who are in the
country illegally endanger public safety and steal jobs and government
resources. He once suggested that they are “poisoning the blood of our
country.” He has promised to carry out the largest deportation operation
in U.S. history if elected.</p>
<p>Trump and his allies often say they distinguish between people
entering illegally versus legally. But during his administration, Trump
also proposed curbs on legal immigration such as family-based visas and
the visa lottery program.</p>
<p>Right after taking office in 2017, he issued his “Buy American and
Hire American” executive order, directing Cabinet members to suggest
reforms to ensure that business visas were awarded only to the
highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers.</p>
<p>He has previously said the H1-B program commonly used by companies to
hire foreign workers temporarily — a program he has used in the past —
was “very bad” and used by tech companies to get foreign workers for
lower pay.</p>
<p>During the conversation with “All-In,” Trump blamed the coronavirus
pandemic for being unable to implement these measures while he was
president. He said he knew of stories of people who graduated from top
colleges and want to stay in the U.S. but can’t secure visas to do so,
forcing them to return to their native countries, specifically naming
India and China. He said they go on and become multibillionaires,
employing thousands of workers.</p>
<p>“You need a pool of people to work for your company,” Trump said.
“And they have to be smart people. Not everybody can be less than smart.
You need brilliant people.”</p>
<p>In a statement released hours after the podcast was posted, campaign
press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: “President Trump has outlined the
most aggressive vetting process in U.S. history, to exclude all
communists, radical Islamists, Hamas supporters, America haters and
public charges. He believes, only after such vetting has taken place, we
ought to keep the most skilled graduates who can make significant
contributions to America. This would only apply to the most thoroughly
vetted college graduates who would never undercut American wages or
workers.”</p>

dismisses Nevada fake elector case over venue question</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>las vegas, nevada — A Nevada judge dismissed an indictment Friday
against six Republicans accused of submitting certificates to the U.S.
Congress falsely declaring Donald Trump the winner of the state’s 2020
presidential election.</p>
<p>Nevada was one of four states with criminal charges pending against
so-called fake electors.</p>
<p>Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford stood after Clark County District
Judge Mary Kay Holthus ruled that Las Vegas was the wrong venue for the
case and said he’d take the case to the state Supreme Court.</p>
<p>“The judge got it wrong, and we’ll be appealing immediately,” Ford, a
Democrat, told reporters, declining additional comment.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys bluntly declared the case dead, saying that to
bring it now before another grand jury in another venue such as Nevada’s
capital of Carson City would violate a three-year statute of limitations
that expired last December.</p>
<p>“They’re done,” said Margaret McLetchie, attorney for Clark County
Republican Party chairman Jesse Law, one of the defendants in the
case.</p>
<p>‘Society is the victim’</p>
<p>The judge called off the trial, which had been scheduled for January,
for defendants who included state GOP chairman Michael McDonald;
national party committee member Jim DeGraffenreid; national and Douglas
County committee member Shawn Meehan; Storey County clerk Jim Hindle;
and Eileen Rice, a party member from the Lake Tahoe area. Each was
accused of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged
instrument — felonies carrying a penalty of up to four or five years in
prison.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys led by McDonald’s lawyer, Richard Wright, contended
that Ford improperly brought the case before a grand jury in Las Vegas —
Nevada’s largest and most Democratic-leaning city — instead of Carson
City or Reno, northern Nevada cities in a more Republican region where
the alleged crimes occurred.</p>
<p>Challenged by Holthus to respond, Deputy State Attorney General
Matthew Rashbrook argued that “no one county contains the entirety of
these crimes.”</p>
<p>“Society is the victim of these crimes,” the prosecutor said. “Voters
who would have been disenfranchised by these acts … would have been
victims of these crimes.”</p>
<p>But the judge decided that even though McDonald and Law live in Las
Vegas, “everything took place up north.”</p>
<p>After the court hearing, Hindle’s attorney, Brian Hardy, declined to
comment on calls from advocacy groups for his client to resign from his
elected position as overseer of elections in Story County.</p>
<p>Meehan is the only defendant not to have been named by the state
party as a Nevada delegate to the 2024 Republican National Convention
next month in Milwaukee. His defense attorney, Sigal Chattah, said her
client chose not to seek the position. Chattah ran as a Republican in
2022 for state attorney general and lost to Ford by just under 8% of the
vote.</p>
<p>False certifications</p>
<p>Nevada is one of seven presidential battleground states where slates
of fake electors falsely certified that Trump had won in 2020, not
Democrat Joe Biden. The others were Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New
Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Nevada’s case, filed last December, focused on the actions of six
defendants. Criminal cases in three other states focus on many more — 16
in Michigan, 19 in Georgia and 18 in Arizona.</p>
<p>Kenneth Chesebro, a lawyer who pleaded guilty in Georgia last October
of helping to orchestrate the Trump campaign fake elector scheme in
2020, cooperated with prosecutors in the Nevada criminal investigation
and was not charged.</p>
<p>In testimony before the grand jury that met in Las Vegas in November,
Chesebro said he provided the state GOP with an “organized step-by-step
explanation of what they would have to do” to sign and submit
certificates falsely stating that Trump, not Biden, won in Nevada.</p>
<p>He also called Nevada “extremely problematic” to the fake elector
plot, compared with other states, because the meeting of electors was
overseen by the secretary of state. Also, unlike other states, Nevada
did not have a legal challenge pending in courts at the time.</p>
<p>Trump lost Nevada in 2020 by more than 30,000 votes to Biden and the
state’s Democratic electors certified the results in the presence of
Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, a Republican.</p>

<h2 id="ny-prosecutors-urge-judge-to-keep-parts-of-trump-gag-order">NY
prosecutors urge judge to keep parts of Trump gag order</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — Prosecutors on Friday urged the judge overseeing Donald
Trump’s criminal hush money case to continue provisions of a gag order
aimed at some of the former president’s public statements.</p>
<p>In court papers, prosecutors with the Manhattan district attorney’s
office argued that parts of the gag order remained necessary given the
Republican’s “singular history of inflammatory and threatening public
statements,” as well as efforts by his supporters to “identify jurors
and threaten violence against them.”</p>
<p>“Since the verdict in this case, defendant has not exempted the
jurors from his alarming rhetoric that he would have ‘every right’ to
seek retribution as president against the participants in this trial as
a consequence of his conviction because ‘sometimes revenge can be
justified,’” the filing states.</p>
<p>The gag order, issued in March, prohibited Trump from making or
directing others to make public statements about witnesses, jurors and
others connected to the case. It does not restrict comments about the
judge, Juan M. Merchan, or Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg,
whose office prosecuted the case.</p>
<p>Attorneys for Trump have called on the judge to lift the order
following the culmination of his trial last month, which ended in his
conviction on 34 felony counts for falsifying records to cover up a
potential sex scandal. Trump, who has denied any wrongdoing, is set to
be sentenced on July 11.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys argue Trump should be free to fully address the
case as he campaigns for the White House, pointing to comments made by
President Joe Biden and the continued public criticism of him by his
ex-lawyer Michael Cohen and adult film actor Stormy Daniels, both key
prosecution witnesses.</p>
<p>“Now that the trial is concluded, the concerns articulated by the
government and the court do not justify continued restrictions on the
First Amendment rights” of Trump, they wrote earlier this month.</p>
<p>In their letter, prosecutors agreed that the provision barring
statements about trial witnesses no longer needed to be enforced but
said the restrictions on statements about court staff and members of the
prosecution, excluding Bragg, should remain in place.</p>
<p>They cited an “intensified” threat situation in recent months, with
more than 60 “actionable threats” directed against Bragg, his family and
court staff since April. The threats include social media posts
disclosing the address of an employee of the district attorney’s office
and a photo showing sniper sights aimed at people involved in the case,
according to police.</p>
<p>Merchan is expected to rule soon, possibly before Trump’s June 27
debate with President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, New York’s top court declined to hear Trump’s
appeal on the gag order, finding it did not raise “substantial”
constitutional issues that would warrant an immediate intervention.</p>

id="trump-lawyers-in-classified-files-case-challenge-prosecutors-appointment">Trump
lawyers in classified files case challenge prosecutor’s appointment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>fort pierce, florida — Lawyers for Donald Trump argued Friday that
the Justice Department prosecutor who charged the former president with
hoarding classified documents at his Florida estate was illegally
appointed and that the case should therefore be dismissed.</p>
<p>The challenge to the legality of special counsel Jack Smith’s
appointment kicked off a three-day hearing that will further delay a
criminal case that had been scheduled for trial last month but has been
snarled by unresolved legal disputes. The motion questioning Smith’s
selection by the Justice Department is one of multiple challenges to the
indictment the defense has raised, so far unsuccessfully, in the year
since the charges were brought.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon heard hours of arguments Friday
from lawyers for both sides, with Trump attorney Emil Bove asserting
that the Justice Department risked creating a “shadow government”
through the appointment of special counsels to prosecute select criminal
cases. Prosecutors say there was nothing improper or unusual about
Smith’s appointment, with James Pearce, a member of Smith’s team at one
point saying: “We are in compliance. We have complied with all of the
department’s policies.” </p>
<p>Cannon did not immediately rule, but in an apparent sign that she was
taking seriously the Trump team motion, she grilled Pearce on what
oversight role Attorney General Merrick Garland — who appointed Smith —
had in seeking the indictment.</p>
<p>Pearce said he was not in a position to answer the question but
noted, “I don’t want to make it seem like I’m hiding something.”</p>
<p>Even as Smith’s team looks to press forward on a prosecution seen by
many legal experts as the most straightforward and clear-cut of the four
prosecutions against Trump, Friday’s arguments didn’t concern the
allegations against the former president. They centered instead on
arcane regulations governing the appointment of Justice Department
special counsels like Smith, reflecting the judge’s continued
willingness to entertain defense arguments that prosecutors say are
frivolous and meritless, contributing to the delay of a trial date.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Arbiter’s review ordered</p>
<p>Cannon, a Trump appointee, had exasperated prosecutors even before
the June 2023 indictment by granting a Trump request to have an
independent arbiter review the classified documents taken from
Mar-a-Lago — an order that was overturned by a unanimous federal appeals
panel.</p>
<p>Since then, she has been intensely scrutinized over her handling of
the case, including for taking months to issue rulings and for
scheduling hearings on legally specious claims — all of which have
combined to make a trial before the November presidential election a
virtual impossibility. She was rebuked in March by prosecutors after she
asked both sides to formulate jury instructions and to respond to a
premise of the case that Smith’s team called “fundamentally flawed.”</p>
<p>The New York Times, citing two anonymous sources, reported Thursday
that two judges — including the chief federal judge in the Southern
District of Florida — urged Cannon to step aside from the case shortly
after she was assigned to it.</p>
<p>The hearing is unfolding just weeks after Trump was convicted in a
separate state case in New York of falsifying business records to cover
up a hush money payment to a porn actor who has said she had sex with
him. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court is poised to issue within days an
opinion on whether Trump is immune from prosecution for acts he took in
office or whether he can be prosecuted by Smith’s team on charges that
he schemed to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential
election.</p>
<p>At issue in Friday’s hearing was a Trump team claim that Smith was
illegally appointed in November 2022 by Garland because he was not first
approved by Congress and because the special counsel office that he was
assigned to lead was not also created by Congress.</p>
<p>Smith’s team has said Garland was fully empowered as the head of the
Justice Department to make the appointment and to delegate prosecutorial
decisions to him. They note that a similar argument failed in a
challenge to the appointment of Robert Mueller, who was tapped as
special counsel by the Trump administration Justice Department to
investigate potential ties between Russia and Trump’s 2016 campaign.</p>
<p>On Monday, the two sides will again discuss matters related to
Smith’s appointment, as well as a limited gag order that prosecutors
have requested to bar Trump from comments they fear could endanger the
safety of FBI agents and other law enforcement officials involved in the
case.</p>
<p>The restrictions were sought after Trump falsely claimed the agents
who searched his Mar-a-Lago estate for classified documents in August
2022 were prepared to kill him even though he was citing boilerplate
language from standard FBI policy about use of force during the
execution of search warrants. The FBI had intentionally selected a day
for the search when it knew Trump and his family would be out of town,
and the policy he was citing is meant to limit, rather than encourage,
the use of force.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers have said any speech restrictions would infringe on
his free-speech rights. Cannon initially rejected the prosecution’s
request on technical grounds, saying Smith’s team had not sufficiently
conferred with defense lawyers before seeking the restrictions.
Prosecutors subsequently renewed the request.</p>

<h2 id="easyos-an-experimental-linux-distribution">EasyOS: an
experimental Linux distribution</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>There’s really a Linux distribution for everyone, it seems. EasyOS
sounds like it’s going to be some Debian derivative with a theme or
something, but it’s truly something different – in fact, it has such a
unique philosophy and approach to everything I barely know where to even
start. Everything in EasyOS runs in containers, in the distribution’s
own custom container format, even entire desktop environments, and
containers are configured entirely graphically. EasyOS runs every
application in RAM, making it insanely fast, and you can save the
contents of RAM to disk whenever you want. You can also choose a special
boot option where the entire session is only loaded in RAM, with disk
access entirely disabled, for maximum security. Now things are going to
get weird. In EasyOS, you always run as root, which may seem like a
stupid thing to do, and I’m sure some people will find this offputting.
The idea, however, is you run every application as its own user
(e.g. Firefox runs as the “firefox” user), entirely isolated from every
other user, or in containers with further constraints applied. I
honestly kind of like this approach. If these first few details of what
EasyOS is going for tickles your fancy, I really urge you to read the
rest of their detailed explanation of what, exactly, EasyOS is going
for. It’s an opinionated distribution, for sure, but it’s opinionated in
a way where they’re clearly putting a lot of thought into the decisions
they make. I’m definitely feeling the pull to give it a try and see if
it’s something for me.</p>

won’t release its new AI features in the EU because they don’t comply
with EU privacy and competition laws</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>Apple has announced it’s not shipping three of its tentpole new
features, announced during WWDC, in the European Union: Apple
Intelligence, iPhone Mirroring, and SharePlay Screen Sharing. Ever since
the introduction of especially Apple Intelligence, the company has been
in hot water over the sourcing of its training data – Apple admitted
it’s been scraping everyone’s data for years and now used it to train
its AI features. This will obviously have included vasts amounts of data
from European websites and citizens, and with the strict EU privacy
laws, there’s a very real chance that such scraping is simply not legal.
As such, it’s simpler to just not comply with such stricter privacy laws
than to design your products with privacy in mind. As Steven
Troughton-Smith quips: How many EU-based sites did Apple scrape to build
the feature it now says it can’t ship in the EU because of legal
uncertainty? ↫ Steven Troughton-Smith Other massive corporations like
Google and Facebook seem to have little issue shipping AI features in
the EU, and have been doing so for quite a while now. And mind you, as
Tim Cook has been very keen to reiterate in every single interview for
the past two years or so, Apple has been shipping AI features similar to
what they announced at WWDC for years as well, but it’s only now that
the European Union is actually imposing regulations on them – instead of
letting corporatism run wild – that it can no longer ship such features
in the EU? Apple is throwing its users under the bus because Tim Cook is
big mad that someone told him no. As I keep reiterating, consent is
something Silicon Valley simply does not understand.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
When I visited the Electrify Expo in Long Beach, California last month,
the traditional automakers had set up tents and booths buzzing with
happy representatives ready to show off their electric and electrified
vehicles to the media and the public. And then there was Fisker, where
one lonely man sat amid a group of Ocean EVs, wondering whether anyone
would talk to him.
</p>
<p>
The writing was already on the wall that day. This week, the electric
startup filed for its inevitable
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/18/business/fisker-ev-bankruptcy.html" target="_blank">Chapter
11 bankruptcy</a> protection.
</p>
<p>
In March, Fisker
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/fisker-ocean-bankruptcy-price-cut" target="_self"><u>slashed</u></a>
the prices of its vehicles in a desperate attempt to stave off
bankruptcy. It did not succeed, nor was there ever a real chance that it
would. The collapse marks the second failed car company for founder
Henrik Fisker, and the
<a href="https://jalopnik.com/comedy-of-errors-led-to-fisker-s-bankruptcy-1851550234" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>list
of reasons makes</u></a> for an excellent business school case study in
what not to do. But for those of us who own an electric vehicle, or may
soon buy one, Fisker’s downfall brings up a question that’s especially
pointed for anyone buying a car from an EV startup: What happens if the
company that made your car isn’t around anymore?
</p>
<p>
The problem is as old as the car industry. While Ford and Chevrolet feel
like they’ve been around since the dawn of time, automotive history is
littered with car brands that don’t make cars anymore. Studebaker.
Hudson. Pontiac. Oldsmobile. Saturn. Packard. One could go on. When the
companies disappeared, their vehicles became
“<a href="https://www.cartalk.com/blogs/jim-motavalli/orphan-cars-good-bad-and-ugly" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>orphan
cars</u></a>” with no parent company around to make parts for or fix
them.
</p>
<p>
Not every orphanage looks the same. Pontiac and Oldsmobile, for example,
were divisions of General Motors by the time they were killed off, so GM
remained to honor warranty claims on the cars. Plymouth owners had
parent company Chrysler to turn to when that marque went to the chrome
mausoleum. Sometimes, a car brand like Isuzu or Suzuki quits selling
cars in the American market but the company itself remains intact, and
so many have been sold previously that plenty of shops and mechanics who
know how to work on those vehicles remain.
</p>
<p>
When a car company that hasn’t operated in the United States for many
years disappears entirely, things get dicier. Enthusiasts still collect
and drive vehicles from long-dead carmakers. But acquiring parts for
them can be a wild goose chase, and maintaining them relies on knowledge
passed down among a select few.
</p>
<p>
Here in the EV era, the few-thousand people who bought (and actually
received) a Fisker Ocean are in a
<a href="https://www.oceanforums.com/threads/chapter-11-and-warranty-work.2826/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tight
spot</u></a>. Their
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fisker/comments/1be2q1u/warranties_and_bankruptcy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>warranty
coverage</u></a> will technically endure as long as Fisker’s court
proceedings are ongoing, since it’s always <em><em>possible</em></em>
that the company could emerge from Chapter 11 and still exist on the
other side. As long as Fisker is in limbo, Ocean owners might be able to
get the company to fix their cars.
</p>
<p>
If the company truly goes belly-up, though — which seems like the
likeliest outcome — then all bets are off. Fisker’s assets would be
liquidated, and owners may be lost in the shuffle as the automaker’s
pieces are sold off for pennies on the dollar to anybody who might want
them.
</p>
<p>
Any Fisker-specific parts would be extremely hard to come by if the
company (which was slow on its production goals in the first place)
vanishes. There would be no more over-the-air software updates to add
features or fix bugs; that’s more bad news since right up to the point
of bankruptcy, the company was sending out updates just to fix
<em><em>basic</em></em> operations. Even relatively simple repairs may
be hard to achieve once Fisker is no more. The U.S. faces an ongoing
<a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/an-ev-mechanic-shortage-is-looming-but-nobody-knows-when-its-coming" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>shortage</u></a>
of auto mechanics trained to fix electric vehicles, which are an
entirely different beast compared to internal combustion. It’s not like
any old garage down the street could or would work on an Ocean.
</p>
<p>
Ocean owners are not silently accepting this crappy outcome. A bunch of
them just
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/724031/fisker-ocean-owners-association-parts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>banded
together</u></a> to form the
<a href="https://www.fiskeroa.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Fisker
Owners Association</u></a> in the hopes of collectively keeping their
rides driveable and viable long after Fisker the company is no more.
They are fighting for ongoing support of the Ocean’s software and
continued access to the 4G internet the vehicle needs for its in-car
navigation system to work. They are tearing apart their Oceans to find
out which parts are common and which are proprietary, and using that
knowledge to build a database for all Fisker drivers.
</p>
<p>
Their troubles — and their collective action to take more control over
their own cars — should be a note of both warning and hope to other EV
drivers. Perhaps the disarray at Fisker makes it a special case that was
doomed to fail at some point. But even respected and well-regarded EV
startups like Lucid and Rivian aren’t in the rosiest financial
situation. The former had to severely slow down its production
projections; the latter is trying to navigate the
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/rivian-earnings-r2-release" target="_self"><u>valley
of death</u></a>” until it can get its mass-market R2 and R3 vehicles on
sale. Even EV king Tesla was reportedly
“<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/musk-tesla-was-about-a-month-from-bankruptcy-during-model-3-ramp.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>about
a month</u></a>” from bankruptcy during the dire months of 2020 when it
tried to scale up manufacturing of the Model 3. Oh, and there was that
time in the 2000s that Detroit’s Big Three
<a href="https://www.autobytel.com/bankruptcy-and-your-new-car-warranty" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>nearly
collapsed</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Rivian and Lucid owners are surely in a better spot than their Fisker
counterparts — both companies are in a better position to succeed than
Fisker ever was, and are more likely to receive the investment they’ll
need to avoid going to bankruptcy court, should it ever come to that.
But there’s never a sure thing in life, and owning an EV from a new
company inherently generates some risk of becoming an orphan.

Jobs Biden Doesn’t Want to Talk About</h2>

<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjQ4MTYyNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1Nzc1OTA5M30.vRDr161EZ24Amr4mccyJvK-PP9eM7QLUODl1Ym82VJ4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
In 1933, with unemployment running at 25%, President Franklin Roosevelt
established the Civilian Conservation Corps, an idea with both practical
and symbolic significance. It put young men to work (at a wage of $30
per month, $25 of which would be sent to their families); by the time it
was shut down during World War II, 3 million volunteers had
participated. They planted trees, created trails, fought fires, aided in
flood control and soil erosion, and shored up infrastructure around the
country. The program helped show the public that a dynamic, aggressive
federal government could work to solve problems large and small.
</p>
<p>
The CCC was so popular that creating a new version of it has long been a
feature of ambitious climate proposals like the Green New Deal. Can we
recapture that spirit, with an army of young people fanning out through
the country to work on today’s key environmental challenges at the same
time as they remind us that government can be the solution, not the
problem? Wouldn’t that be a boon not just to achieving climate goals but
also to the entire progressive project?
</p>
<p>
It might be. But now that the Biden administration has finally
<a href="https://americorps.gov/newsroom/news/biden-harris-administration-announces-more-9000-american-climate-corps-members#:~:text=Today's%20swearing%2Din%20follows%20a,into%20federal%20service%20and%20registered" target="_blank">rolled
out</a> the American Climate Corps (with explicit inspiration from the
CCC) three-and-a-half years into the president’s term, everything about
the program — from the number of people it’s supposed to employ to the
manner in which it was launched — seems awfully modest. It’s a start,
but only that — and it’s a good bet that just a tiny portion of the
public has heard about it.
</p>
<p>
Given how important job creation is to Biden’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-climate-policy" target="_self"><u>governing
philosophy</u></a> and reelection effort, one might think he’d be
trumpeting the ACC in campaign ads, interviews, and at every speech he
gives. And yet he has not. The administration announced this week that
the ACC is now underway, with a
<a href="https://www.acc.gov/join/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>website</u></a>
people can visit to find climate-related jobs. The program will deploy
9,000 workers initially, with a target of 20,000 in the first year.
Those numbers are pretty small, especially compared to what the CCC
looked like in its heyday. To a great extent, though there is a program
now in place, it remains mostly aspirational.
</p>
<p>
The original ambitions for a climate corps were much grander.
<a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-and-rep-ocasio-cortez-introduce-civilian-climate-corps-for-jobs-and-justice-to-rebuild-america" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>One
bill</u></a> introduced in 2021 by Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey and New
York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Democrats both) sought to employ 1.5
million workers. Just days after taking office, Biden issued an
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>executive
order</u></a> on climate that instructed agencies to create a plan for a
“Civilian Climate Corps Initiative.” Democrats wanted to include it in
the Inflation Reduction Act, but by the time that bill worked its way
through the legislative meat-grinder and passed in 2022, the funding had
been dropped. So the administration cobbled together the ACC from
existing climate initiatives,
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/09/20/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-launches-american-climate-corps-to-train-young-people-in-clean-energy-conservation-and-climate-resilience-skills-create-good-paying-jobs-and-tackle-the-clima/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announcing</u></a>
last fall that it would finally come to fruition; this week’s
swearing-in was virtual. While the launch got some write-ups in news
outlets devoted to the environment (see
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-admin-swears-in-first-members-of-american-climate-corps/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>
or
<a href="https://grist.org/solutions/american-climate-corps-swearing-in-ceremony/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>),
it was hardly front-page news.
</p>
<p>
And where the ACC meets the ground, it will likely not have much of a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/biden-heat-pump-rebates" target="_self"><u>recognizable
identity</u></a>. The federal government is channeling the money through
multiple cabinet departments and then on to a
<a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2024/05/03/usda-announces-28-host-organizations-train-future-conservation-and" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>network</u></a>
of public and private organizations, meaning that someone who got a job
through the ACC will, as far as anyone in local communities can see, be
working for the Michigan Department of Agriculture, the Appalachian
Mountain Club, or whichever organization is their ultimate destination.
There hasn’t been any American Climate Corps uniform unveiled, so you
may not be able to spot an ACC worker in your town even if they’re
there.
</p>
<p>
That has its benefits: Local organizations are connected to their
communities, and they could avoid the kind of backlash a program
explicitly associated with Joe Biden might produce in some places. One
wouldn’t want to see young people in official ACC jackets getting
harassed by locals telling them to get Biden’s radical left agenda to
destroy America out of their town. Sometimes, the best way to get
support for a project is to depoliticize it as much as possible.
</p>
<p>
That’s true even if on its face the ACC seems so unobjectionable. Who
could be against giving young people jobs putting up solar panels or
maintaining forests? The basic idea of hiring people to work on
environmental projects is almost absurdly popular;
<a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/politics-global-warming-december-2020/toc/2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one
2020 poll</u></a> from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication
found 85% of respondents in favor of “Re­establish[ing] the Civilian
Conservation Corps, which would employ workers to protect natural
ecosystems, plant trees in rural and urban areas, and restore the soil
on farmlands.”
</p>
<p>
But conservative elites are not on board. After the White House released
its 2025 budget
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/budget_fy2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>request</u></a>
proposing $8 billion in funding over the next decade for the ACC to
expand it to create 50,000 jobs per year,
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-budget-request-triggers-gop-assault-on-climate-corps/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Republicans
pounced</u></a>. Oklahoma Rep. Josh Brecheen called it “a radical green
energy training program,” and Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw said “It’s just
some big, useless government agency with no real direction.” Crenshaw
has sponsored a bill, the
<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/6849" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Canceling
Climate Crusaders Act</u></a>, to prohibit the government from creating
anything like the ACC; another GOP bill to do the same is called the
<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/6215" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>No
American Climate Corps Act</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Those bills are purely symbolic, representing opposition not just to the
ACC but to whatever this administration wants to do on climate, or
anything else for that matter. Biden could declare August to be “Puppies
Are Cute Month” and Fox News would do a dozen segments on the terrifying
conspiracy to turn your dog woke. That kind of opposition may be
inevitable — but not necessarily persuasive to the average voter.
</p>
<p>
There’s also a cost to depriving the ACC of a visible identity. Building
and maintaining support for strong government action on climate means
convincing people that government is capable of doing important things,
and doing them right. When it succeeds, it makes it easier to create the
next program, and the one after that. The more visible those initiatives
are to people, especially right where they live, the more they’ll be
favorably inclined toward other programs to address climate change. It’s
why you
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/climate-inflation-poll" target="_blank">don’t
see many activists talking about</a> the loss of polar bear habitat
anymore: They realized that manifestations of climate change that seem
remote and abstract are less meaningful to people than what they can see
in their own communities and their own lives.
</p>
<p>
The ACC can’t be a true successor to the CCC unless it scales up, and
that means significant independent funding. Even the $8 billion in the
2025 Biden budget would be just a down payment to get to 50,000 ACC
workers; multiply that by 10, and you might achieve something people
could really see working.
</p>
<p>
That’s what made the New Deal so powerful: At a time of crisis,
Americans understood that their government was doing monumental things
to save the country, and the programs it created could be seen
everywhere they looked. If the ACC affects enough lives and communities,
the public will see its value. The trick is getting it big enough — and
singing its praises loudly enough — so they’ll notice.

summer</a> was the hottest in
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/summer-2023-hottest-2000-years" target="_self"><u>two
millennia</u></a>. We won’t get any relief this year.<br/>
</p>
<p>
An overwhelming majority of Americans will experience above-average heat
this summer, and temperatures in more than half of the contiguous United
States are expected to top the historical average by at least 2 degrees
Fahrenheit, according to
<a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-forecasts/sizzling-summer-ahead-accuweather-issues-2024-us-summer-forecast/1644799" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>AccuWeather</u></a>.
New York is expected to endure twice as many 90-plus-degree days as last
year; Boston could experience up to four times as many.
</p>
<p>
Americans got a taste of what’s to come this week, with a blistering
heat wave that began in the Southwest and has scorched the East Coast
for the past three days. That heat may have come early based on the
historical averages, but considering more recent trends, it’s right on
track.
</p>
<p>
“The biggest changes that we have seen in recent decades is that the
heat wave season has been expanding, starting earlier in the late spring
and ending later into early fall, on average,” AccuWeather Senior
Meteorologist Brett Anderson told Heatmap.
</p>
<p>
The northern Rockies, Great Lakes, and the Northeast are areas of
particular concern, Paul Pastelok, AccuWeather’s Lead Long-Range
Forecaster, told Heatmap. Those regions will likely experience less
precipitation and more intense heat this summer compared to their
historical average. “The Northern Plains and Upper Midwest are tricky,”
Pastelok said. “Right now, this area is getting rain, but this could cut
off by the very end of June into July, and turn around to dryness with
the heat following.”
</p>
<p>
While temperatures will most likely peak in the interior Southwest —
Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico — by early July, the region can expect
temperatures between 112 and 118 degrees until then. Monsoon season,
which brings warm winds and rainfall inland, will likely arrive in late
July instead of the usual late June, Pastelok said. Peak heat could come
much later — anytime between July and September — for those in the Great
Lakes, the Ohio Valley, and the Northeast.
</p>
<p>
The biggest “warm anomalies” are expected in the Southwest and central
Rockies, the Great Lakes, the Ohio Valley and the Northeast, according
Tom Kines, a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather. “We are looking at
anomalies for the entire summer of +4 degrees (F) which is pretty
significant over a 3 month period,” Kines wrote in an email to Heatmap.
</p>
<p>
Heat won’t be the only extreme weather this season. Drought could be
severe, particularly in the Southwest — including parts of Texas,
Oklahoma, and Kansas, where rainfall could come in below 50% of the
historical average. That dry spell could intensify over the northern
Plains, Great Lakes, and the Northeast later in the summer. The Gulf
Coast, meanwhile, can anticipate a staggering 22 to 36 inches of rain
this season — compared to its usual 15 to 24 inches — which will likely
make flooding an issue.
</p>
<p>
After a wetter winter, meteorologists
<a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/04/forecasters-expect-slow-start-to-u-s-wildfire-season/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>anticipated</u></a>
a slow start to the wildfire season in California and the Southwest. In
fact, the number of wildfires this year is expected to come in below
average: AccuWeather meteorologists
<a href="https://corporate.accuweather.com/newsroom/severe-weather-advisories/severe-weather-advisory-april-24-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>predict</u></a>
35,000 to 50,000 wildfires this year, compared to a historical average
of about 69,000. Yet the fires in California also seem to have
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/20/us/california-fire-season.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>picked
up speed</u></a> a little earlier than normal. Last week saw more than
two dozen fires in the state, perhaps heralding increased fire activity
to come.
</p>
<p>
So how will we deal with all this? Northern cities, especially, tend to
be less equipped to deal with extreme summer heat. In Boston,
temperatures
<a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/06/19/metro/ken-mahan-new-england-heat-wave-forecast/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reached</u></a>
a record-breaking 98 degrees on Wednesday, a day after Mayor Michelle Wu
<a href="https://www.boston.gov/news/mayor-wu-declares-heat-emergency-june-18-20-opens-bcyf-cooling-centers-all-residents" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>declared</u></a>
a heat emergency. The city opened cooling centers this week in an
attempt to minimize the number of heat-related medical emergencies.
</p>
<p>
Boston Green New Deal Director Oliver Sellers-Garcia told Heatmap that
the city is bringing more government agencies into the heat management
effort. The Fire and Parks departments plan to set up misting stations,
and the city will continue to provide extra pop-up cooling centers in
coordination with Boston’s Centers for Youth and Families. Those
strategies, Sellers-Garcia said, “can have an instant benefit for
someone, whether it’s just a super hot day and they have to get to work
or it’s a declared heat wave.”
</p>
<p>
In Florida, people are used to chronic heat, Miami-Dade County’s Chief
Heat Officer Jane Gilbert told Heatmap. Last year the county had 42 heat
advisories (which happens when the thermometer reaches 105) and 70
warnings (110), Gilbert said, and this season is already proving more
intense: May was the warmest ever on record in the state. To protect
residents, the county has established a comprehensive public awareness
campaign that targets those most affected by the heat, including outdoor
workers, children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people with chronic
illnesses. It also runs more than 30 cooling centers.
</p>
<p>
According to Gilbert, the goal is to educate people about the extent of
heat impacts so they can make better choices — drink more water, find
shade, limit physical activity — and protect their health. “We haven’t
fully appreciated, historically as a community, how it impacts our
lives,” she said.
</p>
<p>
<em>Here’s what’s happened so far …</em>
</p>
<h3>
The U.S. celebrated the official start of summer with a scorching heat
dome
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
<em>June 21: </em>Communities from Kansas to Maine experienced
record-breaking temperatures, with heat indices above 100 degrees
Fahrenheit in some places. Cities including Philadelphia, Cleveland, and
Burlington, Vermont opened cooling centers, and Boston and New York
activated heat emergency plans. Schools in Buffalo, New York moved to
half-day schedules for the week in response to temperature advisories.
</p>
<p>
The heat wave was expected to hold into the weekend, increasing the risk
of emergencies. But ensuring that at-risk residents are aware of public
services and heat mitigation strategies is often more difficult than
simply providing amenities like cooling centers and air conditioners,
Benjamin Zaitchik, a professor of climate dynamics at Johns Hopkins
University, told Heatmap. “Preventing heat deaths — in principle, at
least — is easy,” Zaitchik said. “It just requires good planning, good
communication, good networks.”
</p>
<p>
The same heatwave afflicted much of the Southwestern United States the
week before. Temperatures in Phoenix and Las Vegas exceeded 110 degrees,
breaking records and prompting cities to issue heat advisories covering
tens of millions of people. At a Trump rally in Las Vegas, 24 people
received treatment for heat-related complications and six were
hospitalized, <em>The Guardian</em>

<h3>
Hundreds of millions voted in extreme heat
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
<em>May and June: </em>Both Mexico and India faced extreme temperatures
during national elections.
</p>
<p>
Record-breaking heat waves have scorched Mexico since late March,
causing blackouts, wildfires, heat strokes, and animal deaths. On May
25, Mexico City set a new heat record, with the temperature there
surpassing 94.4 degrees, while other cities in the country registered
even higher temperatures — well above 115 degrees. As of June 12, at
least
<a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/extreme-heat-killing-more-than-100-people-in-mexico-hotter-and-much-more-likely-due-to-climate-change/" target="_blank"><u>125
deaths</u></a> had been attributed to the heat, which has been made
worse by an intense drought linked to El Niño. With reservoirs at less
than 27% capacity, millions could run out of water by the end of this
month.
</p>
<p>
World Weather Attribution, a research group that analyzes the degree to
which climate change is causing extreme weather events, estimated that
global warming has made extreme temperatures in the region 35 times more
likely. “These trends will continue with future warming and events like
the one observed in 2024 will be very common” in a world where average
temperatures are 2 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial levels,
the group
<a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/extreme-heat-killing-more-than-100-people-in-mexico-hotter-and-much-more-likely-due-to-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>stated</u></a>
in a release.
</p>
<p>
Despite sweltering conditions, about 100 million voters elected Claudia
Sheinbaum, Mexico’s first female president, on June 2. In her victory
speech, Sheinbaum, a climate scientist with a focus on energy
engineering, said she will work to maintain the country’s energy
sovereignty. While Sheinbaum has vouched to expand the country’s
renewable energy, she has also been criticized for her support of Pemex,
the state-owned oil company.
</p>
<p>
Two days later, on June 4, India re-elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi
for a third term during the country’s longest-ever heatwave. By the time
the weeks-long voting process wrapped, extreme heat had killed more than
100 people. In Uttar Pradesh, at least 33 poll workers died in a single
day,
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/02/india/india-heatwave-poll-worker-deaths-intl-hnk/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>CNN
reported</u></a>. In response, local governments have imposed measures
to prevent water waste and protect construction workers. Yet, according
to
<a href="https://cprindia.org/briefsreports/how-is-india-adapting-to-heatwaves-an-assessment-of-heat-action-plans-with-insights-for-transformative-climate-action/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>analysis</u></a>
by the Centre for Policy Research found in 2023, most of India’s
heatwave policies are underfunded and fail to target the country’s most
vulnerable groups.
</p>
<p>
More extreme weather hammered Mexico beginning June 20 as tropical storm
Alberto brought torrential rain and flooding to the country’s east.
AccuWeather meteorologists said the storm is just the start of a
predicted intense hurricane season in the area. Most of India is still
under heatwave alerts, but the weather is set to improve in the next few
days as the monsoon finally
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/indias-monsoon-advances-set-bring-relief-heatwave-2024-06-20/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>advances</u></a>

Drought is still threatening China’s wheat belt
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
<em>May:</em> Scarce rainfall and soaring heat have led to
<a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2024-06-13/China-activates-emergency-response-to-drought-1uoz2J9cnT2/p.html" target="_blank"><u>drought</u></a>
conditions that are threatening China’s food production and water
supply. The provinces of Shandong and Henan — crucial to the country’s
wheat production — are some of the most affected, and the State Flood
Control and Drought Relief Headquarters has dispatched two disaster
relief guidance teams. New technology, such as multi-functional seeders,
and multiple reservoirs have been deployed to ameliorate conditions.
</p>
<p>
Also on Wednesday, the China Meteorological Administration
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/14/business/china-record-heat-rain-food-security-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>
that several regional weather stations recorded the highest temperatures
ever in mid-June. Conditions are expected to worsen, as some Chinese
provinces are expected to reach 111 degrees this week.

<p class="drop-caps">
It takes about 45 minutes to circumnavigate Odessa, Texas. There’s a
highway — 338, known locally as “The Loop” — that encircles the city of
113,000 people in West Texas. Drive along it and you’ll be treated to a
nearly unending parade of oil derricks jabbing their way into the
underlying Permian Basin, just as they have for roughly the past
century. You’d be forgiven for calling Odessa an “energy
community.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
You’d also be wrong, according to the Federal Government. On June 7, the
Department of the Treasury published an
<a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/treasury-irs-release-guidance-for-the-energy-community-bonus-credit-under-the-inflation-reduction-act" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>updated
list of energy communities</u></a>. Included in that list were San
Francisco, Barnstable County (which covers all of Cape Cod), and, in
total, about
<a href="https://arcgis.netl.doe.gov/portal/apps/experiencebuilder/experience/?id=a2ce47d4721a477a8701bd0e08495e1d" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>50%
of the land area</u></a> of the United States. Conspicuously absent were
famously oily localities such as Odessa, Midland, and Oklahoma City.
</p>
<p>
So how did San Francisco — where
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/us/san-francisco-sea-lions.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sea
lions</u></a> outnumber
<a href="https://atlas.eia.gov/apps/e1c92d7601b9490697d22dfe2da1b4ac/explore" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>oil
wells</u></a> — become an energy community instead of Odessa?
</p>
<p>
To understand the new guidance, it’s worth exploring why the federal
government is concerned about energy communities in the first place.
Scattered across the U.S. are hundreds of towns that depend on coal,
oil, and gas production for their livelihoods. Towns like these — often
located next to coal mines or on top of oil reserves — stand to lose
vital jobs and tax revenues should the country transition from fossil
fuels to clean energy. In the eyes of lawmakers, this presents an
unacceptable risk to both local economies and to any hope of durable
support for climate action.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376/text" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Inflation
Reduction Act</u></a> sought to remedy that by making any clean energy
project located in one of these communities eligible for a 10% tax
credit, on top of whatever other tax credits it was already collecting.
This bonus, it was hoped, could allow clean energy to replace some of
the economic activity lost to the eventual decline of fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
What followed, however, is a case study in the importance of defining
terms.
</p>
<p>
The IRA defined an energy community as any one of the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A brownfield site, meaning any location where redevelopment is made more
difficult by the presence of a hazardous substance;
</li>
<li>
A coal community, meaning any census tract where a coal mine or
generator has closed in the past 15 years (as well as all adjacent
census tracts); or
</li>
<li>
A high fossil fuel employment area—specifically, any metropolitan or
non-metropolitan statistical area (“MSA” or “NMSA,” respectively) that
has (i) 0.17% or more of its workforce in the fossil fuels industry and
(ii) an unemployment rate at or above the national average.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It’s this third category where things get sticky. Treasury was charged
with interpreting these rules, and by its methodology,
<a href="https://data.census.gov/table/CBP2021.CB2100CBP?q=CBP2021.CB2100CBP&hidePreview=true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fossil
fuel employment</u></a> in the United States represents 0.41% of the
workforce, or more than double the level specified in the IRA. That
means that a city could have a fossil fuel workforce far smaller,
proportionally, than the national average and still qualify as an energy
community.
</p>
<p>
But the issues don’t stop there, according to Daniel Raimi. Raimi
directs the Equity in the Energy Transition Initiative at Resources for
the Future, a DC-based think tank.
<a href="https://www.rff.org/publications/reports/what-is-an-energy-community-alternative-approaches-for-geographically-targeted-energy-policy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>He’s
been warning</u></a> about the flaws in the energy communities framework
since 2022. He told me there are two main problems with how the
government defines an energy community.
</p>
<p>
First, MSAs and NMSAs are a crude tool for capturing geographic
variation. In some parts of the country, their boundaries roughly track
city limits. But in other parts — Alaska, for example — they can be the
size of Germany. That means that two towns 700 miles apart with little
in common economically could nevertheless count themselves as part of
the same basic geographic unit.
</p>
<p>
Second, hitching the definition of an energy community to the national
unemployment rate exposes it to wild fluctuations. Areas where the local
unemployment is close to the national rate could gain and lose their
status as an energy community from year to year, depending on which side
of the threshold they find themselves. Moreover, said Raimi, “Since so
many places exceed 0.17% fossil fuel employment, a relatively small
change in national unemployment has a big effect on the map.”
</p>
<p>
That dynamic was on display this year. As
<a href="https://www.bls.gov/lau/data.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>national
unemployment fell by 0.01%</u></a> in 2023 compared to 2022, large
swaths of the country — such as western Wyoming and eastern Mississippi
— lost their status, while other regions — such as northern Idaho and
northern Arkansas — suddenly qualified. On net, an area the size of New
Mexico got added to the map of energy communities this year. Meanwhile,
much of the nation’s oil country — including Texas and Oklahoma’s
Permian Basin, Colorado’s Denver-Julesburg Basin, and large part of
North Dakota’s Bakken Formation — was excluded.
</p>
<p>
I spoke with a Treasury official, who agreed to speak only on background
and acknowledged Raimi’s concerns but stressed that the Department was
merely executing the letter of the law. Given the specificity of the
statute, they pointed out, there was little Treasury could do to more
accurately target the benefits. The Department did issue
<a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-23-29.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
rule</u></a> last year clarifying that any clean energy project that
qualified for the tax credit when it began construction would retain
that tax credit even if the location subsequently lost its status as an
energy community, insulating it from year-to-year changes.
</p>
<p>
Still, Raimi worries that the current approach will prevent government
support from reaching the communities that need it most. “Because
they’re not carefully targeted, they are unlikely to receive lots of new
investment from this tax credit,” Raimi told me.
</p>
<p>
And it could get expensive. With roughly half of the country qualifying
for the bonus, said Raimi, “I think we’re going to be spending tens of
billions of dollars in places where we don’t need to spend that money.”
(The Treasury official downplayed concerns over the program’s
costliness.)
</p>
<p>
What would a more precise approach look like? For starters, abandon the
MSAs and NMSAs. “County level makes a lot of sense,” Raimi said.
“Everybody knows what a county is, and developers and government
officials can easily understand whether or not they’re going to be
eligible for the credit.”
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, Raimi wishes public policy would focus more on future
impacts. “We know that to get to a net-zero emissions future, we need to
use less of all the fossil fuels,” he said. “The places that heavily
rely on them — like the Bakken, like the Permian, like parts of Oklahoma
— they’re going to need a long time to build new economic sectors. Now
is the time to start trying to do that.”

id="us-and-china-hold-first-informal-nuclear-talks-in-5-years-eyeing-taiwan">US
and China hold first informal nuclear talks in 5 years, eyeing
Taiwan</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HONG KONG — The United States and China resumed semi-official nuclear
arms talks in March for the first time in five years, with Beijing’s
representatives telling U.S. counterparts that they would not resort to
atomic threats over Taiwan, according to two American delegates who
attended.</p>
<p>The Chinese representatives offered reassurances after their U.S.
interlocutors raised concerns that China might use, or threaten to use,
nuclear weapons if it faced defeat in a conflict over Taiwan. Beijing
views the democratically governed island as its territory, a claim
rejected by the government in Taipei.</p>
<p>“They told the U.S. side that they were absolutely convinced that
they are able to prevail in a conventional fight over Taiwan without
using nuclear weapons,” said scholar David Santoro, the U.S. organizer
of the Track Two talks, the details of which are being reported by
Reuters for the first time.</p>
<p>Participants in Track Two talks are generally former officials and
academics who can speak with authority on their government’s position,
even if they are not directly involved with setting it.
Government-to-government negotiations are known as Track One.  </p>
<p>Washington was represented by about half a dozen delegates, including
former officials and scholars at the two-day discussions, which took
place in a Shanghai hotel conference room.  </p>
<p>Beijing sent a delegation of scholars and analysts, which included
several former People’s Liberation Army officers.</p>
<p>A State Department spokesperson said in response to Reuters’
questions that Track Two talks could be “beneficial.” The department did
not participate in the March meeting though it was aware of it, the
spokesperson said.  </p>
<p>Such discussions cannot replace formal negotiations “that require
participants to speak authoritatively on issues that are often highly
compartmentalized within (Chinese) government circles,” the spokesperson
said.</p>
<p>Members of the Chinese delegation and Beijing’s defense ministry did
not respond to requests for comment.  </p>
<p>The informal discussions between the nuclear-armed powers took place
with the U.S. and China at odds over major economic and geopolitical
issues, with leaders in Washington and Beijing accusing each other of
dealing in bad faith.  </p>
<p>The two countries briefly resumed Track One talks over nuclear arms
in November but those negotiations have since stalled, with a top U.S.
official publicly expressing frustration at China’s responsiveness.</p>
<p>The Pentagon, which estimates that Beijing’s nuclear arsenal
increased by more than 20% between 2021 and 2023, said in October that
China “would also consider nuclear use to restore deterrence if a
conventional military defeat in Taiwan” threatened CCP rule.</p>
<p>China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its
control and has over the past four years stepped up military activity
around the island.  </p>
<p>The Track Two talks are part of a two-decade nuclear weapons and
posture dialog that stalled after the Trump administration pulled
funding in 2019.  </p>
<p>After the COVID-19 pandemic, semi-official discussions resumed on
broader security and energy issues, but only the Shanghai meeting dealt
in detail with nuclear weapons and posture.</p>
<p>Santoro, who runs the Hawaii-based Pacific Forum think-tank,
described “frustrations” on both sides during the latest discussions but
said the two delegations saw reason to continue talking. More
discussions were being planned in 2025, he said.  </p>
<p>Nuclear policy analyst William Alberque of the Henry Stimson Centre
think-tank, who was not involved in the March discussions, said the
Track Two negotiations were useful at a time of glacial U.S.-Chinese
relations.</p>
<p>“It’s important to continue talking with China with absolutely no
expectations,” he said, when nuclear arms are at issue.</p>
<p>No first-use?</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Defense estimated last year that Beijing has
500 operational nuclear warheads and will probably field more than 1,000
by 2030.  </p>
<p>That compares to 1,770 and 1,710 operational warheads deployed by the
U.S. and Russia respectively. The Pentagon said that by 2030, much of
Beijing’s weapons will likely be held at higher readiness levels.</p>
<p>Since 2020, China has also modernized its arsenal, starting
production of its next-generation ballistic missile submarine, testing
hypersonic glide vehicle warheads and conducting regular nuclear-armed
sea patrols.</p>
<p>Weapons on land, in the air and at sea give China the “nuclear triad”
- a hallmark of a major nuclear power.</p>
<p>A key point the U.S. side wanted to discuss, according to Santoro,
was whether China still stood by its no-first-use and minimal deterrence
policies, which date from the creation of its first nuclear bomb in the
early 1960s.</p>
<p>Minimal deterrence refers to having just enough atomic weapons to
dissuade adversaries.</p>
<p>China is also one of two nuclear powers - the other being India - to
have pledged not to initiate a nuclear exchange. Chinese military
analysts have speculated that the no-first-use policy is conditional -
and that nuclear arms could be used against Taiwan’s allies - but it
remains Beijing’s stated stance.  </p>
<p>Santoro said the Chinese delegates told U.S. representatives that
Beijing maintained these policies and that “‘we are not interested in
reaching nuclear parity with you, let alone superiority.’”  </p>
<p>“‘Nothing has changed, business as usual, you guys are
exaggerating’,” Santoro said in summarizing Beijing’s position.</p>
<p>His description of the discussions was corroborated by fellow U.S.
delegate Lyle Morris, a security scholar at the Asia Society Policy
Institute.  </p>
<p>A report on the discussions is being prepared for the U.S. government
but would not be made public, Santoro said.</p>
<p>‘Risk and Opacity’</p>
<p>Top U.S. arms control official Bonnie Jenkins told Congress in May
that China had not responded to nuclear-weapons risk reduction proposals
that Washington raised during last year’s formal talks.  </p>
<p>China has yet to agree to further government-to-government
meetings.</p>
<p>Bejing’s “refusal to substantively engage” in discussions over its
nuclear build-up raises questions around its “already ambiguous
stated”no-first-use” policy and its nuclear doctrine more broadly,” the
State Department spokesperson told Reuters.  </p>
<p>China’s Track Two delegation did not discuss specifics about
Beijing’s modernization effort, Santoro and Morris said.</p>
<p>Alberque of the Henry Stimson Centre said that China relied heavily
on “risk and opacity” to mitigate U.S. nuclear superiority and there was
“no imperative” for Beijing to have constructive discussions.</p>
<p>China’s expanded arsenal - which includes anti-ship cruise missiles,
bombers, intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarines - exceeded
the needs of a state with a minimal deterrence and no-first-use policy,
Alberque said.  </p>
<p>Chinese talking points revolved around the “survivability” of
Beijing’s nuclear weapons if it suffered a first strike, said
Morris.</p>
<p>The U.S. delegates said the Chinese described their efforts as a
deterrence-based modernization program to cope with developments such as
improved U.S. missile defenses, better surveillance capabilities, and
strengthened alliances.</p>
<p>The U.S., Britain and Australia last year signed a deal to share
nuclear submarine technology and develop a new class of boats, while
Washington is now working with Seoul to coordinate responses to a
potential atomic attack.</p>
<p>Washington’s policy on nuclear weapons includes the possibility of
using them if deterrence fails, though the Pentagon says it would only
consider that in extreme circumstances. It did not provide specifics.
 </p>
<p>One Chinese delegate “pointed to studies that said Chinese nuclear
weapons were still vulnerable to U.S. strikes - their second-strike
capability was not enough,” said Morris.</p>

“From counterterrorism efforts to cyber threats and peacekeeping
missions, this conference will cover it all. Experts and military
leaders will share insights, strategies, and forge partnerships that
will strengthen the collective defense capabilities for all of Africa.
This is more than just a conference — it’s a significant step towards a
unified approach in safeguarding the African continent.”</p>
<p>AFRICOM says the meeting will build on the success of previous
conferences. Last year’s meeting held in Rome, Italy, attracted the
highest turnout, with 43 countries in attendance.</p>
<p>“It is evident that Africa faces a series of challenges,” said Jakkie
Cilliers, a political scientist at the Institute for Security Studies in
Pretoria. “It is not always clear that the model that the U.S. presents
is appropriate for Africa. In recent years, we have seen a variety of
coups in Africa, sometimes executed by African forces that have been
trained in the U.S., the U.K. and France. And it is also evident that a
number of U.N. peacekeeping missions, such as that in the DR Congo and
Mali, are withdrawing from Africa.</p>
<p>“On the other hand, the role of Russia and the so-called Africa Group
[pls check the audio; it is usually called the Africa Corps] is
expanding. So, it’s clear that Africa is facing a security challenge,
and partners can and should do as much as possible to help.”</p>
<p>Cilliers added that there is a need for the Gaborone conference to
come up with effective solutions to the continent’s security
challenges. </p>
<p>“Are we seeing a new model developing where African governments are
considering alternative security arrangements, mostly by other African
countries?” he said. “And of course, the role of private companies is
also increasing. These events occur at a time of significant shifts in
the global balance of power, and Africa again is an area of competition.
One hopes all these issues will be discussed at the upcoming conference
in Gaborone, and that real solutions will come to the fore.”</p>
<p>In March, following its Peace and Security Council meeting, the
African Union expressed “deep concern” over the scourge of conflicts on
the continent and their impact on socioeconomic development.</p>

<p>
During the sunniest hours of the longest days of the year, solar power
can now provide about 20% of the world’s electricity, according to
<a href="https://ember-climate.org/insights/in-brief/the-global-solar-revolution/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8vwIQiInF9t6t3FqFOIahapl9tvXyJCxIPn0TMiSvwogvuXmomxRMXIM7i1khnZYYkNsxE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new
estimates from energy think tank Ember</a>. That’s up from 16% last
year. Throughout the entire month of June, solar will account for
roughly 8.2% of global electricity, up from 6.7% in the same month last
year, and higher than the 5.5% annual average across the whole of 2023.
The report underscores the rapid expansion of solar, which is now the
fastest-growing source of electricity. “As solar continues to expand, it
is poised to further transform the power sector and accelerate the
world’s transition to renewable energy,” the authors said.

<li>Startup plans to use methane to make graphite
</h3>
<p>
A California-based startup called Molten Industries is trying to
transform natural gas into a key component for making lithium-ion
batteries. The company has “developed a specialized technique to break
methane into graphite and hydrogen, the latter of which can be used as a
source of clean energy,” <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em>
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-20/california-startup-creates-key-electric-vehicle-battery-material-from-methane?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8vwIQiInF9t6t3FqFOIahapl9tvXyJCxIPn0TMiSvwogvuXmomxRMXIM7i1khnZYYkNsxE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.
Graphite is used to make batteries, but most of it comes from China, so
Molten wants to onshore production at a competitive cost. The company
says its graphite production was a sort of happy accident. “Our original
focus was just to make the lowest-cost hydrogen with the most
energy-efficient reactor possible,” said co-founder and CEO Kevin Bush.
Molten announced this week a $25 million series A round of funding led
by Breakthrough Energy Ventures. It plans to use the money to build its
first modular commercial reactor.

this week it will stop using plastic “air pillows” to protect the

The shift will be completed by the end of 2024, and will mean 15 billion

in part by support among investors for cutting waste, but it’s helped by
the fact that Amazon discovered recycled paper protects packages better

<p>date: 2024-06-21, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;This is the 43rd edition of &lt;em&gt;People and Blogs&lt;/em&gt;, the series where I ask interesting people to talk about themselves and their blogs. Today we have Jennifer &quot;💕 Devastatia 💕&quot; del Gato and her blog, &lt;a href=&quot;https://devastatia.com&quot;&gt;devastatia.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I think I have mentioned it before but I absolutely love her site
because it’s precisely everything mine isn’t. My site is this super
clean, super calm place, with no JS, no weirdness going on, and almost
no images. Her site is a proper experience and you’ll understand what I
mean when you click that link. And even though the containers are
incredibly different we share an appreciation for a certain type of
living the web which is why I’m very grateful to have her as a guest on
this series.

<h2>
Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?
</h2>
<p>
I was born and raised in the southern United States. I think I got a
reasonably decent public education in an era just before the education
system, both higher and lower, started becoming extremist
indoctrination. You’ll find countless Gen Xers online these days
reminiscing about the things we used to do as kids. There’s not much I
can add to that as far as everyday life goes.
</p>
<p>
I became an avid fan of science fiction at an early age, and developed a
fascination with history, science, electronics, and computers. The two
latter were the same hobby back then, actually. You had to understand
electronics to mess around with computers.
</p>
<h2>
What’s the story behind your blog?
</h2>
<p>
The funny thing is that I don’t really call my website a “blog” or
consider myself to be a “blogger” per se. I didn’t really have a plan or
goal for what I wanted to do with my personal website when I started it.
I only knew that the social media paradigm wasn’t working for me, and I
needed to do something else.
</p>
<p>
My stock in trade has long been shitposting on “free speech” forums and
social media. I have a habit of getting banned from social media sites
because the normies don’t get my sense of humor. I’m not interested in
making my opinions “advertiser-friendly,” nor in virtue-signaling to
censorious, self-righteous ideologues. It’s popular amongst the
simple-minded these days to label people as bigots on the basis of
colorful remarks. In so doing, the self-appointed thought police often
completely miss the point the writer was trying to make. As a feral Gen
Xer, I don’t have the patience to walk on eggshells around thin-skinned
people. If I can’t be honest and authentic, then why bother?
</p>
<p>
An essential aspect of my modus operandi is to always return to a “last
known good” state when current conditions aren’t yielding favorable
results. I’ve been on the World Wide Web since 1994, and have owned
personal websites before. I mean that’s what everybody did when the
Internet was first opened to the public. The ever-growing litany of
creative constraints imposed by social media over the years more or less
forced my return to the “real” Internet.
</p>
<p>
The name “Devastatia” was a nickname I made up for a cat I used to have.
Audrey and her big brother Elvis liked to tear things up, as cats do, so
I gave them the nicknames Dr. Destructo and his lovely assistant,
Devastatia. It had a gothy ring to it, and since I’m a goth, I thought
it’d make a catchy screen name.
</p>
<p>
I thought it would be funny to spoof social media “influencers” —
low-talent midwits with swollen egos — so I built a sort of role-playing
character around that idea. That’s how Devastatia was born.
</p>
<h2>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?
</h2>
<p>
You’ve heard the expression, “The jokes write themselves,” right? Well,
the Internet is basically one big lolcow for those of us who can see the
humor in almost anything. Most of my social commentary and shitposting
is in response to things I see online.
</p>
<p>
Nearly everything I write is my own opinion and shouldn’t be taken as
fact. “Fact-checking” has acquired an unsavory connotation for me due to
the way it’s ham-handedly rammed down our throats, sans nuance or
context, by ideologues in the mainstream media and on social media. When
I do research something, it’s usually just a quick Web search in which I
choose a few links that have intriguing titles or summaries, not
necessarily the “most relevant” results as decided by the search
engines. Some of those links lead to fact-checking articles, but they’re
not typically the agenda-driven kind.
</p>
<p>
I re-read and edit the crap out of an article after I publish it,
usually for hours, and sometimes for days. I’m careful not to make
spelling or grammatical errors, but some occasionally slip through. I
catch most of them the same day by re-reading though. Most of my editing
is done to improve the flow of a passage, to add content I forgot to
include in the first draft, or to express something in a more
picturesque way. Sometimes I’ll come up with a relevant joke hours
later, and throw it in retroactively to liven the piece up.
</p>
<p>
I think the most glaring error I’ve made was a continuity error in one
of my erotic short stories. A reader brought it to my attention months
after the piece was published. A peripheral character, coincidentally
named Manuel, was identified as the brother of a main character in one
episode, but as his cousin in the following episode.
</p>
<p>
I write a lot about Web development because that’s what interests me. I
decorate my pages with irrelevant naughty pictures because I like
looking at them, and my readers tell me they do too. I aim to be nerdy,
funny, and sexy at the same time. I think I mostly succeed at that.
</p>
<h2>
Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the
physical space influences your creativity?
</h2>
<p>
I just need for it to be reasonably quiet and dark. When I started
messing with computers, everything was green or amber text in a
fixed-width font on a black background — which, incidentally, is why my
website resembles an old school terminal. I use a dark mode browser
plugin on every site I visit. Staring at a page with a white background
is like staring into a flashlight. Why would anybody do such a thing?
</p>
<p>
I usually don’t notice my physical surroundings at all once I get into
the groove. I keep the temperature at around 77° Fahrenheit and wear as
few clothes as possible, so I don’t even feel the air, really.
</p>
<p>
I’m also blind in my right eye and nearsighted in the left, so I sit
pretty close to the monitor. Most of the items on my desk have dark
colors, so I don’t really notice anything in my peripheral vision when
there are no lights on nearby.
</p>
<p>
I use a 75% mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX switches, again because
that’s what I’m used to from the early days of home computing. I detest
touch screens and keyboards with short-travel switches.
</p>
<h2>
A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech
stack?
</h2>
<p>
My basic tools are <a href="https://www.geany.org/">Geany</a>, a coding
text editor for Linux similar to UltraEdit or Notepad++ for Windows;
FileZilla, an FTP client that’s ubiquitous on Windows, Mac, and Linux
PCs; and Firefox. If I happen to be in the terminal and need to take a
quick look at something, I’ll open it in vim. I haven’t used Github that
much since I left the corporate world. The tools I use now are the same
ones I used when I first started making personal websites years ago.
</p>
<p>
All of my sites are hosted on
<a href="https://siteground.com/">SiteGround</a>. Page loads are very
fast, their tech support is prompt and effective, and their “grow big”
plan gives me everything I need. I don’t remember where I registered my
domain name. It’s registered either through SiteGround or DreamHost.
</p>
<p>
I absolutely hate reading other people’s code. When I worked as a
professional developer, I became disenchanted with the emphasis on
integrating third-party software over writing custom code. I’m not an
integrator, and I’m definitely not a “coder.” I’m a programmer. That’s
what I got into this racket to do, and now that I have full creative
control, that’s what I do.
</p>
<p>
With the exception of a couple of PHP packages and some code snippets
borrowed from Stack Overflow and elsewhere, everything on my site is
hand-coded by me. I don’t use third-party frameworks or general-purpose
libraries period, let alone a third-party CMS. Everything is written
either specifically for its task or as a component that I can reuse for
multiple similar tasks.
</p>
<h2>
Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do
anything differently?
</h2>
<p>
I think the question presumes I have a purpose or goal in mind when I
start something, which isn’t necessarily the case. I’ll oftentimes start
working on something because I find the technology interesting, and the
use case will present itself later.
</p>
<p>
That said, my current website is showing its limitations, and I’m slowly
developing the next version. This is only my second single-page
application (SPA), and the first in which I got everything working as
expected. I’ve constantly added features over the past seven or eight
months, and it’s reached the point where it’d be easier to rewrite most
of it from scratch than to keep adding onto the existing platform.
</p>
<p>
I won’t change my domain name or the name of my site because it’s the
name I’m known by. One doesn’t change a trademark that has achieved
brand recognition without a good reason. Companies only do so when they
get a bad reputation due to scandal. Well, I’m not overly concerned
about my reputation. I mean I have a slutty online persona and write
naughty stories, both by choice. Those things are fun for me, and I
don’t believe that’ll ever change.
</p>
<h2>
Financial question since the Web is obsessed with money: how much does
it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost, or does it generate some
revenue? And what’s your position on people monetising personal blogs?
</h2>
<p>
It’d be difficult to separate the cost of running my personal site from
the cost of running my other sites because they’re all on a single
hosting plan. Moreover, the plan includes capabilities that aren’t
available with the typical “basic” plan because, as somebody who
compulsively tinkers with technology, I know I’ll use them. I also
prefer traditional .com, .net, or .org domain names when available,
which tend to cost a little more than some of the newer “personal
website” top-level domains.
</p>
<p>
I have three sites at the moment, and will probably build others. As of
now, simple division of the total cost by the number of sites yields an
average cost of about 156 USD per year. That’s about what I’d pay for
three domain names and individual hosting plans from the same company,
and the per-site cost will decrease as I add more sites.
</p>
<p>
I don’t try to monetize my site, nor make any effort to promote it in
the major search engines. This is a personal project that I work on for
the fun of it. The Personal Web as a community has plenty of grassroots
ways to help a website gain attention — webrings, listing sites, blog
carnivals, etc. — from those who are interested in personal websites.
</p>
<p>
I don’t have anything against other people monetizing their blogs if
they choose to do so, but it’s not for me. Again, this is all for fun
and “at will.” I don’t want to be held to other people’s expectations
regarding deadlines, messaging, or the type or quality of content I
produce.
</p>
<h2>
Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out?
And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?
</h2>
<p>
One of the most fascinating people I know on the Personal Web isn’t a
blogger at all. Magill, or
<a href="https://bohemiansultriness.nekoweb.org/">Fritzi</a> as she’s
known on the Personal Web, is a well-read 60s pop culture aficionado
who, in addition to making charming little brochure sites, publishes
<a href="https://theliverpudlianbardot.neocities.org/">erotic Beatles
fan fiction</a> on <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/">Archive of Our
Own</a> (AO3). Fritzi isn’t a professional Web designer, but you’d never
guess it because she’s exceptionally talented.
</p>
<p>
And you’ll definitely want to interview
<a href="https://sarajaksa.eu/">Sara Jaksa</a>. Sara is a brilliant
woman whose correspondence I enjoy immensely. I’d love to hear from her
more frequently, but I understand that her work keeps her very busy.
What I like most about Sara is that she doesn’t give shallow answers,
but considers things deeply before forming an opinion. It’d be
interesting to read her answers to some of your questions.
</p>
<h2>
Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?
</h2>
<p>
I’m a blurter. Anything I want to share will most likely appear on my
website the moment it wanders into my mind. I use my site the same way
I’d use Twitter if I weren’t banned from there. I’m always throwing
things at the wall to see what’ll stick.
</p>
<p>
As for projects, I’m working on a free RSS feed reader for personal
website feeds called <a href="https://www.geeklyreader.com/">The Geekly
Reader</a>. Commercial readers making money from blogs that the authors
themselves haven’t monetized just doesn’t sit well with me. In my view,
they’re the same as low-effort YouTubers whose videos are nothing but a
text-to-speech program reading a Reddit thread. The days of corporations
profiting from other people’s free content need to end.
</p>
<p>
When I heard that 123Guestbook is shutting down in July, I started a
project at <a href="https://personal-web.org/">Personal-Web.org</a> to
provide a replacement for static website owners who use 123Guestbook.
Depending on how much utilization that service gets, I may provide other
hosted widgets later.

id="chinas-top-prosecutor-urges-officials-to-focus-on-illicit-drug-trafficking">China’s
top prosecutor urges officials to focus on illicit drug trafficking</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIJING — China’s top prosecutor urged law enforcement officials
across the country on Friday to focus efforts on combating drug
trafficking, capping a week in which Beijing and Washington announced a
rare joint counternarcotics investigation.</p>
<p>The Supreme People’s Procuratorate published “six typical cases,”
involving actions ranging from postal fraud to medical professionals
selling illicit drugs on the side, and clarified the legal application
standards to handle such cases.</p>
<p>The prosecutor said in a statement that the release was meant to show
its “determination and attitude to intensify efforts to crack down on
related crimes, while hoping that this batch of typical cases will serve
as a warning to the society.”</p>
<p>The United States and China held high-level counternarcotics talks on
Thursday following a breakthrough in bilateral cooperation this week in
which both sides went after a major drug-linked money laundering
operation.</p>
<p>The United States, where fentanyl abuse has been a major cause of
death, has pushed China for deeper law enforcement cooperation,
including tackling illicit finance and further controls on the chemicals
that can be used to make fentanyl.</p>
<p>These chemicals are often shipped to the U.S. and other destinations
from China using mail packages that have unverifiable addresses or are
mislabeled, experts say. The U.S. Postal Service has for years struggled
with the problem.</p>
<p>One of the examples highlighted in the prosecutor’s note on Friday
involved a case of a Chinese buyer, surnamed Yan, purchasing date-rape
drug triazolam from overseas and then selling it in China by mail using
mislabeled packaging.</p>
<p>As a result, “the procuratorate issued a procuratorial suggestion to
the postal administration department…urging the regulatory department to
fulfill its main responsibility and perform its duties
conscientiously.”</p>
<p>The postal administration then “urged the company to make timely
rectifications,” the prosecutor said.</p>
<p>The note said “the procuratorate invited nearly 100 couriers and
college students to attend the trial, focusing on the new
characteristics and new forms of new drug cases to carry out anti-drug
law publicity.”</p>
<p>Postal fraud was briefly mentioned in the opening remarks by Rahul
Gupta, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control
Policy, who on Thursday held talks in Beijing with China’s minister of
public security, Wang Xiaohong.</p>
<p>Gupta said it was among the “areas where we’re both being negatively
impacted,” listing it alongside illicit finance, “illegal drug
trafficking and use, and the emergence of new and more dangerous
drugs.”</p>

<h2 id="us-bans-russias-kaspersky-antivirus-software">US bans Russia’s
Kaspersky antivirus software</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration on Thursday
banned Russia-based cybersecurity firm Kaspersky from providing its
popular antivirus products in the United States over national security
concerns, the U.S. Commerce Department said.</p>
<p>“Kaspersky will generally no longer be able to, among other
activities, sell its software within the United States or provide
updates to software already in use,” the agency said in a statement.</p>
<p>The announcement came after a lengthy investigation found Kaspersky’s
“continued operations in the United States presented a national security
risk due to the Russian Government’s offensive cyber capabilities and
capacity to influence or direct Kaspersky’s operations,” it said.</p>
<p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said, “Russia has shown time
and again they have the capability and intent to exploit Russian
companies, like Kaspersky Lab, to collect and weaponize sensitive U.S.
information.”</p>
<p>Kaspersky, in a statement to AFP, said the Commerce Department “made
its decision based on the present geopolitical climate and theoretical
concerns,” and vowed to “pursue all legally available options to
preserve its current operations and relationships.”</p>
<p>“Kaspersky does not engage in activities which threaten U.S. national
security and, in fact, has made significant contributions with its
reporting and protection from a variety of threat actors that targeted
U.S. interests and allies,” the company said.</p>
<p>The move is the first such action taken since an executive order
issued under Donald Trump’s presidency gave the Commerce Department the
power to investigate whether certain companies pose a national security
risk.</p>
<p>Raimondo said the Commerce Department’s actions demonstrated to
America’s adversaries that it would not hesitate to act when “their
technology poses a risk to the United States and its citizens.”</p>
<p>While Kaspersky is headquartered in Moscow, it has offices in 31
countries around the world, servicing more than 400 million users and
270,000 corporate clients in more than 200 countries, the Commerce
Department said.</p>
<p>As well as banning the sale of Kaspersky’s antivirus software, the
Commerce Department also added three entities linked to the firm to a
list of companies deemed to be a national security concern, “for their
cooperation with Russian military and intelligence authorities in
support of the Russian government’s cyber intelligence objectives.”</p>
<p>The Commerce Department said it “strongly encouraged” users to switch
to new vendors, although its decision does not ban them from using the
software should they choose to do so.</p>
<p>Kaspersky is allowed to continue certain operations in the United
States, including providing antivirus updates, until September 29, “in
order to minimize disruption to US consumers and businesses and to give
them time to find suitable alternatives,” it added.</p>

id="border-patrol-reports-arrests-down-25-since-biden-announced-asylum-restrictions">Border
Patrol reports arrests down 25% since Biden announced asylum
restrictions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The number of arrests by Border Patrol agents of people
crossing illegally into the United States fell in May to the third
lowest of any month during the Biden presidency, while preliminary
figures released Thursday show encounters with migrants falling even
more in the roughly two weeks since the president announced new rules
restricting asylum. </p>
<p>The figures are likely welcome news for a White House that has been
struggling to show to voters concerned about immigration that it has
control of the southern border. But the number of people coming to the
border is often in flux, dependent on conditions in countries far from
the U.S. and on smugglers who profit from global migration. </p>
<p>The Border Patrol made 117,900 arrests of people entering the country
between the official border crossing points in May, Customs and Border
Protection said in a news release. That’s 9% lower than during April,
the agency said. The agency said preliminary data since President Joe
Biden’s June 4 announcement restricting asylum access show arrests have
fallen by 25%. </p>
<p>“Our enforcement efforts are continuing to reduce Southwest border
encounters. But the fact remains that our immigration system is not
resourced for what we are seeing,” said Troy A. Miller, the acting head
of CBP. </p>
<p>The U.S. has also benefited from aggressive enforcement on the
Mexican side of the border, where Mexican authorities have been working
to prevent migrants from making their way to the U.S.-Mexico
border. </p>
<p>The figures are part of a range of data related to immigration, trade
and drug seizures that the CBP releases monthly. The immigration-related
figures are closely watched at a time of intense political scrutiny over
who is entering the country and whether the Biden administration has a
handle on the situation. </p>
<p>Immigration is a top concern for voters, with many saying Biden
hasn’t been doing enough to secure the country’s borders. Former
President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for
president, has made immigration a cornerstone of his campaign by saying
he’s going to deport people in the country illegally en masse and take
other measures to crack down on immigration. </p>
<p>After Biden announced his plan to restrict asylum access at the

genius.

US veteran died alone; hundreds of strangers came to say goodbye</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>AUGUSTA, Maine — Former U.S. Marine Gerry Brooks died alone at a
nursing home in Maine, abandoned and all but forgotten. Then the funeral
home posted a notice asking if anyone would serve as a pallbearer or
simply attend his burial. </p>
<p>Within minutes, it was turning away volunteers to carry his
casket. </p>
<p>A bagpiper came forward to play at the service. A pilot offered to
perform a flyover. Military groups across the state pledged a proper
sendoff. </p>
<p>Hundreds of people who knew nothing about the 86-year-old beyond his
name showed up on a sweltering afternoon and gave Brooks a final salute
with full military honors Thursday at the Maine Veterans’ Memorial
Cemetery in Augusta. </p>
<p>Patriot Guard Riders on motorcycles escorted his hearse on the
40-mile route from the funeral home in Belfast, Maine, to the cemetery.
Members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars paid tribute with a 21-gun
salute. Volunteers held American flags next to the casket while a crane
hoisted a huge flag above the cemetery entrance. </p>
<p>Some saluted while filing by. Others sang The Marines’ Hymn. </p>
<p>“It’s an honor for us to be able to do this,” said Jim Roberts,
commander of the VFW post in Belfast. “There’s so much negativity in the
world. This is something people can feel good about and rally around.
It’s just absolutely wonderful.” He said Brooks’ son, granddaughter and
son-in-law came to the funeral but did not speak during the
service. </p>
<p>‘We will always be there’</p>
<p>The VFW is called a couple times a year about a deceased veteran with
no family or with one that isn’t willing to handle the funeral
arrangements, said Roberts. But “we will always be there.” Like other
veterans helping out Thursday, he hadn’t known Brooks. </p>
<p>So many groups volunteered to take part in paying tribute that there
wasn’t enough space to fit them into the 20-minute burial service, said
Katie Riposta, the funeral director who put out the call for help last
week. </p>
<p>“It renews your faith in humanity,” she said. </p>
<p>More than 8 million of the U.S. veterans living are 65 or older,
almost half the veteran population. They are overwhelmingly men. That’s
according to a U.S. Census Bureau report last year. As this generation
dies, it said, their collective memory of wartime experiences “will pass
into history.” </p>
<p>A master of ‘dad jokes’</p>
<p>Much about Brooks’ life is unknown. </p>
<p>He was widowed and lived in Augusta. He died on May 18, less than a
week after entering a nursing home, Riposta said. A cause of death was
not released. </p>
<p>The funeral home and authorities reached his next of kin, but no one
was willing to come forward or take responsibility for his body, she
said. </p>
<p>“It sounds like he was a good person, but I know nothing about his
life,” Riposta said, noting that after Brooks’ death, a woman contacted
the funeral home to say he had once taken her in when she had no other
place to go, with no details. </p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if he served one day or made the military his
career,” she said. “He still deserves to be respected and not
alone.” </p>
<p>The crowd on Thursday wasn’t all strangers — and it turned out Brooks
hadn’t been one, either. </p>
<p>Victoria Abbott, executive director of the Bread of Life shelter in
Augusta, said he had come every day to eat at their soup kitchen, always
ready to crack “dad jokes” and make the staff smile. He had a favorite
table. </p>
<p>“Your quintessential 80-year-old, dad jokes every day,” Abbott said.
“He was really great to have around. He was part of the soup kitchen
family.” </p>
<p>But most people there Thursday met him too late. The memorial book
posted online by Direct Cremation of Maine, which helped to arrange the
burial, had a few strangers’ good wishes. </p>
<p>“Sir,” one began, and ended with “Semper Fi.” </p>
<p>The two others, a couple, thanked Brooks for his service. “We all
deserve the love kindness and respect when we are called home. I hope
that you lived a full beautiful life of Love, Kindness, Dreams and
Hope,” they wrote. </p>
<p>They added: “Thank you to all those who will make this gentleman’s
service a proper, well-deserved goodbye.” </p>
<p>Linda Laweryson, who served in the Marines, said this was the second
funeral in little over a year that she has attended for a veteran who
died alone. Everyone deserves to die with dignity and be buried with
dignity, she said. </p>
<p>Laweryson read a poem during the graveside service written by a
combat Marine who reflects on the spot where Marines graduate from boot
camp. </p>
<p>“I walked the old parade ground, but I was not alone,” the poem
reads. “I walked the old parade ground and knew that I was home.”</p>
