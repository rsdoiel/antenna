governor signs law banning all plastic shopping bags at grocery
stores</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Sacramento, California — “Paper or plastic” will no longer be a
choice at grocery store checkout lines in California under a new law
signed Sunday by Gov. Gavin Newsom that bans all plastic shopping
bags.</p>
<p>California had already banned thin plastic shopping bags at
supermarkets and other stores, but shoppers could purchase bags made
with a thicker plastic that purportedly made them reusable and
recyclable.</p>
<p>The new measure, approved by state legislators last month, bans all
plastic shopping bags starting in 2026. Consumers who don’t bring their
own bags will now simply be asked if they want a paper bag.</p>
<p>State Sen. Catherine Blakespear, one of the bill’s supporters, said
people were not reusing or recycling any plastic bags. She pointed to a
state study that found that the amount of plastic shopping bags trashed
per person grew from 3.6 kilograms per year in 2004 to 5 kilograms per
year in 2021.</p>
<p>Blakespear, a Democrat from Encinitas, said the previous bag ban
passed a decade ago didn’t reduce the overall use of plastic.</p>
<p>“We are literally choking our planet with plastic waste,” she said in
February.</p>
<p>The environmental nonprofit Oceana applauded Newsom for signing the
bill and “safeguarding California’s coastline, marine life, and
communities from single-use plastic grocery bags.”</p>
<p>Christy Leavitt, Oceana’s plastics campaign director, said Sunday
that the new ban on single-use plastic bags at grocery store checkouts
“solidifies California as a leader in tackling the global plastic
pollution crisis.”</p>
<p>Twelve states, including California, already have some type of
statewide plastic bag ban in place, according to the environmental
advocacy group Environment America Research &amp; Policy Center.
Hundreds of cities across 28 states also have their own plastic bag bans
in place.</p>
<p>The California Legislature passed its statewide ban on plastic bags
in 2014. The law was later affirmed by voters in a 2016 referendum.</p>
<p>The California Public Interest Research Group said Sunday that the
new law finally meets the intent of the original bag ban.</p>
<p>“Plastic bags create pollution in our environment and break into
microplastics that contaminate our drinking water and threaten our
health,” said the group’s director Jenn Engstrom. “Californians voted to
ban plastic grocery bags in our state almost a decade ago, but the law
clearly needed a redo. With the governor’s signature, California has
finally banned plastic bags in grocery checkout lanes once and for
all.”</p>
<p>As San Francisco’s mayor in 2007, Newsom signed the nation’s first
plastic bag ban.</p>

id="spending-deal-averts-possible-us-federal-shutdown-funds-government-into-december">Spending
deal averts possible US federal shutdown, funds government into
December</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Congressional leaders announced an agreement Sunday on a
short-term spending bill that will fund federal agencies for about three
months, averting a possible partial government shutdown when the new
budget year begins Oct. 1 and pushing final decisions until after the
November election.</p>
<p>Lawmakers have struggled to get to this point as the current budget
year winds to a close at month’s end. At the urging of the most
conservative members of his conference, House Speaker Mike Johnson had
linked temporary funding with a mandate that would have compelled states
to require proof of citizenship when people register to vote.</p>
<p>But Johnson could not get all Republicans on board even as the
party’s presidential nominee, Donald Trump, insisted on that package.
Trump said Republican lawmakers should not support a stop-gap measure
without the voting requirement, but the bill went down to defeat anyway,
with 14 Republicans opposing it.</p>
<p>Bipartisan negotiations began in earnest shortly after that, with
leadership agreeing to extend funding into mid-December. That gives the
current Congress the ability to fashion a full-year spending bill after
the Nov. 5 election, rather than push that responsibility to the next
Congress and president.</p>
<p>In a letter to Republican colleagues, Johnson said the budget measure
would be “very narrow, bare-bones” and include “only the extensions that
are absolutely necessary.”</p>
<p>“While this is not the solution any of us prefer, it is the most
prudent path forward under the present circumstances,” Johnson wrote.
“As history has taught and current polling affirms, shutting the
government down less than 40 days from a fateful election would be an
act of political malpractice.”</p>
<p>Rep. Tom Cole, the House Appropriations Committee chairman, had said
on Friday that talks were going well.</p>
<p>“So far, nothing has come up that we can’t deal with,” said Cole,
R-Okla. “Most people don’t want a government shutdown and they don’t
want that to interfere with the election. So nobody is like, ‘I’ve got
to have this or we’re walking.’ It’s just not that way.”</p>
<p>Johnson’s earlier effort had no chance in the Democratic-controlled
Senate and was opposed by the White House, but it did give the speaker a
chance to show Trump and conservatives within his conference that he
fought for their request.</p>
<p>The final result — government funding effectively on autopilot — was
what many had predicted. With the election just weeks away, few
lawmakers in either party had any appetite for the brinksmanship that
often leads to a shutdown.</p>
<p>Now a bipartisan majority is expected to push the short-term measure
over the finish line. Temporary spending bills generally fund agencies
at current levels, but some additional money was included to bolster the
Secret Service, replenish a disaster relief fund and aid with the
presidential transition, among other things.</p>

id="ukraines-zelenskyy-visits-pennsylvania-ammunition-factory-to-thank-workers">Ukraine’s
Zelenskyy visits Pennsylvania ammunition factory to thank workers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Scranton, Pennsylvania — Under extraordinarily tight security,
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday visited the
Pennsylvania ammunition factory that is producing one of the most
critically needed munitions for his country’s fight to fend off Russian
ground forces.</p>
<p>His visit to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant kicked off a busy
week in the United States to shore up support for Ukraine in the war. He
will speak at the U.N. General Assembly annual gathering in New York on
Tuesday and Wednesday and then travel to Washington for talks on
Thursday with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>As Zelenskyy’s large motorcade made its way to the ammunition plant
on Sunday afternoon, a small contingent of supporters waving Ukrainian
flags assembled nearby to show their appreciation for his visit to thank
the workers.</p>
<p>The area around the ammunition plant had been sealed off since the
morning, with municipal garbage trucks positioned across several
roadblocks and a very heavy presence of city, regional and state police,
including troopers on horseback.</p>
<p>The Scranton plant is one of the few facilities in the country to
manufacture 155 mm artillery shells and has increased production over
the past year.</p>
<p>The 155 mm shells are used in howitzer systems, which are towed large
guns with long barrels that can fire at various angles. Howitzers can
strike targets up to 24 kilometers to 32 kilometers away and are highly
valued by ground forces to take out enemy targets from a protected
distance.</p>
<p>Ukraine has already received more than 3 million of the 155 mm shells
from the U.S.</p>
<p>“It’s unfortunate that we need a plant like this, but it’s here, and
it’s here to protect the world,” said Vera Kowal Krewsun, a
first-generation Ukrainian American who was among those who greeted
Zelenskyy’s motorcade. “And I strongly feel that way.”</p>
<p>She said many of her friends’ parents have worked in the ammunition
plant, and she called Zelenskyy’s visit “a wonderful thing.”</p>
<p>Laryssa Salak, 60, whose parents also immigrated from Ukraine, also
said she was pleased Zelenskyy came to thank the workers. She said it
upsets her that funding for Ukraine’s defense has divided Americans and
that even some of her friends oppose the support, saying the money
should go to help Americans instead.</p>
<p>“But they don’t understand that that money does not directly go to
Ukraine, Salak said.”It goes to American factories that manufacture,
like here, like the ammunition. So that money goes to American workers
as well. And a lot of people don’t understand that.”</p>
<p>With the war now well into its third year, Zelenskyy has been pushing
the U.S. for permission to use longer range missile systems to fire
deeper inside of Russia.</p>
<p>So far he has not persuaded the Pentagon or White House to loosen
those restrictions.</p>
<p>The Defense Department has emphasized that Ukraine can already hit
Moscow with Ukrainian-produced drones, and there is hesitation on the
strategic implications of a U.S.-made missile potentially striking the
Russian capital.</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Russia would be “at
war” with the United States and its NATO allies if they allow Ukraine to
use the long-range weapons.</p>
<p>At one point in the war, Ukraine was firing between 6,000 and 8,000
of the 155 mm shells per day. That rate started to deplete U.S.
stockpiles and drew concern that the level on hand was not enough to
sustain U.S. military needs if another major conventional war broke out,
such as in a potential conflict over Taiwan.</p>
<p>In response the U.S. has invested in restarting production lines and
is now manufacturing more than 40,000 155 mm rounds a month, with plans
to hit 100,000 rounds a month.</p>
<p>Two of the Pentagon leaders who have pushed that increased production
through — Doug Bush, assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition,
logistics and technology, and Bill LaPlante, the Pentagon’s top weapons
buyer — were expected to join Zelenskyy at the plant, as was
Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.</p>
<p>The 155 mm rounds are just one of the scores of ammunition, missile,
air defense and advanced weapons systems the U.S. has provided Ukraine —
everything from small arms bullets to advanced F-16 fighter jets. The
U.S. has been the largest donor to Ukraine, providing more than $56
billion of the more than $106 billion NATO and partner countries have
collected to aid in its defense.</p>
<p>Even though Ukraine is not a member of NATO, commitment to its
defense is seen by many of the European nations as a must to keep Putin
from further military aggression that could threaten bordering
NATO-member countries and result in a much larger conflict.</p>

id="republicans-in-swing-states-say-they-see-scant-signs-of-groups-door-knocking-for-trump">Republicans
in swing states say they see scant signs of groups door-knocking for
Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Lansing, Michigan — Republican activists in swing states say they
have seen little sign of the teams tasked with knocking on doors and
turning out infrequent voters on behalf of Donald Trump, raising
concerns about the party’s presidential nominee relying on outside
groups for an important part of his campaign operations.</p>
<p>Trump and the Republican National Committee he controls opted to
share get-out-the-vote duties in key parts of the most competitive
states this year with groups such as America PAC, the organization
supported by billionaire Elon Musk.</p>
<p>It is difficult to demonstrate that something is not happening. But
with fewer than 50 days until the Nov. 5 election, dozens of Republican
officials, activists and operatives in Michigan, North Carolina and
other battleground states say they have rarely or never witnessed the
group’s canvassers. In Arizona and Nevada, the Musk-backed political
action committee replaced its door-knocking company just this past
week.</p>
<p>“I haven’t seen anybody,” said Nate Wilkowski, field director for the
Republican Party in vote-rich Oakland County, Michigan, which includes
crucial Detroit suburbs. He was speaking specifically of America PAC.
“Nobody’s given me a heads-up that they’re around in Oakland County
areas.”</p>
<p>Trump has relied on the loyalty of his fervent base, in an election
expected to pivot on turnout. The spotty evidence, however, of what was
portrayed as a sophisticated operation has some party activists
questioning the operation’s value. Trump’s campaign views the race with
Vice President Kamala Harris as a toss-up among likely voters but
believes it has the edge among people who stayed away in 2016 and 2020,
making it even more essential to reach them.</p>
<p>The work is particularly important in Michigan, where Trump lost by
fewer than 160,000 votes in 2020, and where the Republican Party began
the year mired in debt and fighting an ugly contest over the rightful
state party leader.</p>
<p>Michigan’s Republican chairman, Pete Hoekstra, said he was told that
America PAC canvassers had arrived in late August and were at work. A
spokesperson for the PAC said canvassers were in Michigan, as well as
Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin —
the seven most competitive states. The spokesperson declined to say how
many canvassers there were across the states.</p>
<p>Meghan Reckling, a Republican canvassing firm owner in Michigan, said
she spotted two America PAC canvassers Tuesday in Oakland County.
Identifiable in blue polo shirts emblazoned with “America,” they were
working an area that Reckling’s own data showed to be one with
low-propensity voters, she said.</p>
<p>“They had, you could tell, a very pleasant exchange with the lady who
answered the door, and probably talked to her for five minutes,”
Reckling said. “From what I observed, they were obviously engaging in
direct conversations.”</p>
<p>But in interviews with more than two dozen activists and party
officials across the seven battleground states, such reports were
rare.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what the PACs are doing,” said Mark Forton, the
Republican chair in Macomb County, Michigan, a populous, suburban area
northeast of Detroit. “I don’t know if they are going door to door.”</p>
<p>Trump aides say the campaign has an estimated 30,000 volunteer
captains who are identifying less likely voters at the local level,
including through neighborhood canvassing.</p>
<p>Campaign political director James Blair also estimates that close to
2,500 paid canvassers, with America PAC making up a significant chunk,
are working in the seven states. The PAC has paid canvassing firms more
than $14 million since mid-August for work on the presidential campaign,
according to Federal Election Commission spending reports filed by the
group.</p>
<p>Blair dismissed the statement that the campaign was ceding work to
outside groups. Instead, he said, the campaign was making use of “the
resources within those groups to bolster the frequency of contacts and
the total coverage within the universe of where we would want them.”</p>
<p>“We very much are focused on low-propensity voters, because it’s what
makes strategically the most sense in terms of how the president is
going to win these states, and these groups’ efforts have helped reach
them,” Blair said.</p>
<p>America PAC is run by former top aides to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’
failed presidential campaign. Trump’s team also is sharing the
responsibility of reaching less-frequent voters with groups that include
Turning Point USA, led by conservative millennial personality Charlie
Kirk, and the Faith and Freedom Coalition, headed by Christian
conservative figure Ralph Reed.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for the campaign’s move was the result of an FEC
ruling this year that a candidate’s campaign and outside groups could
coordinate their canvassing efforts with super PACs, and specifically
share voter lists and data that they collect door to door. It means
campaigns could share much of their labor- and cost-heavy ground efforts
with groups that can take unlimited donations.</p>
<p>Harris’ outreach on the ground in the seven states is being led by
campaign-paid staff, a number the campaign puts at nearly 2,200 in more
than 328 offices. Campaign aides said groups affiliated with labor
organizations were canvassing independent of the campaign.</p>
<p>The vast majority of what outside groups that support Harris are
doing is advertising. Based on ad reservations for Harris and the
leading super PAC supporting her, they are on track to spend nearly $175
million more than Trump’s campaign and the leading super PACs supporting
him by Election Day. Harris’ campaign has outspent Trump’s on
advertising by 2-to-1 since she entered the race on July 23, according
to the media tracking firm AdImpact.</p>
<p>Over the past week, there were complications for America PAC, the
most high-profile of the groups helping Trump in 2024.</p>
<p>America PAC fired Nevada-based canvassing company September Group,
according to two people familiar with the matter. America PAC had paid
the company almost $2.7 million a month ago, according to FEC reports.
The people familiar with September Group’s dismissal spoke on condition
of anonymity to discuss private business decisions.</p>
<p>A spokesman for America PAC declined to confirm the move.</p>
<p>Trump is not the first candidate to delegate some typical
campaign-managed duties to outside groups. But the arrangement has not
gone smoothly for some of the others who have tried it.</p>
<p>Last year, DeSantis entrusted much of the political outreach for his
Republican presidential campaign to a super PAC called Never Back Down,
with conflict between its board and top campaign personnel late in the
lead-up to the Iowa caucuses. Despite starting the campaign with roughly
$100 million, DeSantis dropped out after losing the first contest in
Iowa.</p>
<p>In his unsuccessful quest for the 2016 Republican presidential
nomination, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush attempted something very
similar, ceding much of the political infrastructure work to a super PAC
called Right to Rise, which raised more than $114 million in 2015.</p>

<h2 id="on-new-york-visit-indias-modi-celebrates-cultural-ties">On New
York visit, India’s Modi celebrates cultural ties</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Uniondale, New York — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, continuing
a multiday U.S. visit, addressed a cultural celebration on Long Island
Sunday, where he praised the United States’ return of nearly 300
antiquities to India and relayed news of his country’s dual win at the
Chess Olympiad in Budapest, Hungary, to an enthusiastic crowd.</p>
<p>“I just got some very good news,” Modi told an estimated 13,000
people inside Nassau Veterans Coliseum for an event billed as a
celebration of cultural ties between India and the United States. “In
the Chess Olympiad, in both the men’s and women’s tournament, India has
won gold medals,” he said to applause in a speech that was translated
into English for an online audience.</p>
<p>Modi was reelected in June following a marathon election in which
more than 640 million votes were cast over a span of six weeks in the
world’s largest democratic exercise.</p>
<p>“This year, 2024, is a very important one for the entire world,” he
said. “On the one hand, there are conflicts raging between several
countries in the world, there is tension. And on the other, democracy is
being celebrated in several countries of the world. India and America
are also together in this celebration of democracy.”</p>
<p>Modi’s appearance in New York came a day after he attended a summit
hosted by President Joe Biden in Wilmington, Delaware, for leaders of
the so-called Quad that also included Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of
Australia and Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan.</p>
<p>Also Saturday, Modi accepted the return of 297 antiquities spanning
thousands of years that had been stolen or trafficked from India. The
U.S. has returned nearly 600 such cultural artifacts to India since
2016, according to India’s Ministry of External Affairs.</p>
<p>On Monday, the prime minister is expected to attend a United Nations
summit in advance of this week’s General Assembly.</p>
<p>Sunday’s event was sponsored by the not-for-profit Indo American
Community of USA.</p>

id="us-to-propose-ban-on-chinese-software-hardware-in-connected-vehicles-sources-say">US
to propose ban on Chinese software, hardware in connected vehicles,
sources say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. Commerce Department is expected on Monday to
propose prohibiting Chinese software and hardware in connected and
autonomous vehicles on American roads due to national security concerns,
two sources told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has raised serious concerns about the
collection of data by Chinese companies on U.S. drivers and
infrastructure as well as the potential foreign manipulation of vehicles
connected to the internet and navigation systems.</p>
<p>The proposed regulation would ban the import and sale of vehicles
from China with key communications or automated driving system software
or hardware, said the two sources, who declined to be identified because
the decision had not been publicly disclosed.</p>
<p>The move is a significant escalation in the United States’ ongoing
restrictions on Chinese vehicles, software and components. Last week,
the Biden administration locked in steep tariff hikes on Chinese
imports, including a 100% duty on electric vehicles as well as new hikes
on EV batteries and key minerals.</p>
<p>Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in May the risks of Chinese
software or hardware in connected U.S. vehicles were significant.</p>
<p>“You can imagine the most catastrophic outcome theoretically if you
had a couple million cars on the road and the software were disabled,”
she said.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden in February ordered an investigation into whether
Chinese vehicle imports pose national security risks over connected-car
technology – and if that software and hardware should be banned in all
vehicles on U.S. roads.</p>
<p>“China’s policies could flood our market with its vehicles, posing
risks to our national security,” Biden said earlier. “I’m not going to
let that happen on my watch.”</p>
<p>The Commerce Department plans to give the public 30 days to comment
before any finalization of the rules, the sources said. Nearly all newer
vehicles on U.S. roads are considered “connected.” Such vehicles have
onboard network hardware that allows internet access, allowing them to
share data with devices both inside and outside the vehicle.</p>
<p>The department also plans to propose making the prohibitions on
software effective in the 2027 model year and the ban on hardware would
take effect in January 2029 or the 2030 model year. The prohibitions in
question would include vehicles with certain Bluetooth, satellite and
wireless features as well as highly autonomous vehicles that could
operate without a driver behind the wheel.</p>
<p>A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers in November raised alarm about
Chinese auto and tech companies collecting and handling sensitive data
while testing autonomous vehicles in the United States.</p>
<p>The prohibitions would extend to other foreign U.S. adversaries,
including Russia, the sources said.</p>
<p>A trade group representing major automakers including General Motors,
Toyota Motor, Volkswagen, Hyundai and others had warned that changing
hardware and software would take time.</p>
<p>The carmakers noted their systems “undergo extensive pre-production
engineering, testing, and validation processes and, in general, cannot
be easily swapped with systems or components from a different
supplier.”</p>
<p>The Commerce Department declined to comment on Saturday. Reuters
first reported, in early August, details of a plan that would have the
effect of barring the testing of autonomous vehicles by Chinese
automakers on U.S. roads. There are relatively few Chinese-made
light-duty vehicles imported into the United States.</p>
<p>The White House on Thursday signed off on the final proposal,
according to a government website. The rule is aimed at ensuring the
security of the supply chain for U.S. connected vehicles. It will apply
to all vehicles on U.S. roads, but not for agriculture or mining
vehicles, the sources said.</p>
<p>Biden noted that most cars are connected like smartphones on wheels,
linked to phones, navigation systems, critical infrastructure and to the
companies that made them.</p>

Beetlejuice’ scares off ‘Transformers’ for third week as box office
No. 1</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — It’s a three-peat for “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.”</p>
<p>The Tim Burton legacy sequel to his 1988 horror comedy topped the
North American box office charts for the third straight weekend with $26
million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.</p>
<p>It edged out the animated new release “Transformers: One,” which
brought in $25 million. The Optimus Prime origin story from Paramount
Pictures features the voices of Chris Hemsworth, Brian Tyree Henry and
Scarlett Johansson.</p>
<p>“Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,” a Warner Bros. release with Michael Keaton
and Winona Ryder returning as stars, has earned more than $226 million
domestically in its three weeks after a monster opening of $110 million
— the third best of the year — and a second weekend of $51.6
million.</p>
<p>Third place went to the James McAvoy horror “Speak No Evil,” which
came in at $5.9 million in its second week for a total of $21.5
million.</p>
<p>On the whole, the box office was in a quiet phase that is expected to
break when ” Joker: Folie à Deux ” dances its way onto the big screen on
Oct. 4.</p>
<p>The year’s second-highest grosser ” Deadpool &amp; Wolverine ”
remained in the top 5 in its ninth weekend with another $3.9 million and
a domestic total of $627 million. Only Pixar’s “Inside Out 2” has earned
more.</p>
<p>The Demi Moore-starring, Coralie Fargeat-directed body horror “The
Substance,” which made a splash at the Cannes Film Festival, brought in
$3.1 million on limited screens in its first weekend for the sixth
spot.</p>
<p>The Daily Wire movie “Am I Racist?” — in which conservative columnist
Matt Walsh goes undercover as a “DEI trainee” — stayed in the top 10
after a fourth place finish last week, earning $2.9 million for seventh
place and a two-week total of $9 million.</p>
<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian
theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released
Monday.</p>

id="investor-focus-turns-to-data-election-earnings-after-fed-rate-cut">Investor
focus turns to data, election, earnings after Fed rate cut</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — A roaring rally in U.S. stocks will face a gauntlet of
economic data, looming political uncertainty and a corporate earnings
test in coming weeks as investors navigate one of the most volatile
periods of the year for equity markets.  </p>
<p>The benchmark S&amp;P 500 .SPX last week hit its first closing
all-time high in two months after the Federal Reserve unveiled a hefty
50-basis point rate cut, kicking off the first U.S. monetary easing
cycle since 2020.  </p>
<p>The index is up 0.8% so far in September, historically the weakest
month for stocks, and has gained 19% year-to-date. But the rocky period
could carry over until the Nov 5 election, strategists said, leaving the
S&amp;P 500 vulnerable to market swings.  </p>
<p>“We’re entering that period where seasonality has been a bit less
favorable,” said Angelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at
Edward Jones. “Despite the excitement about the start of the new
rate-cutting cycle, it could still be a bumpy road ahead.”  </p>
<p>The second half of September is historically the weakest two-week
period of the year for the S&amp;P 500, according to a Ned Davis
Research analysis of data since 1950.  </p>
<p>The index has also logged an average 0.45% decline in October during
presidential years, data from CFRA going back to 1945 showed.  </p>
<p>Volatility also tends to pick up in October in election years, with
the Cboe Market Volatility index .VIX rising to an average level of 25
at the start of the month, as opposed to its long-term average of 19.2,
according to an Edward Jones analysis of the past eight presidential
election years. The VIX was recently at 16.4.  </p>
<p>The market could be particularly sensitive to this year’s close
election between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris.
Recent polls show a virtually tied race.  </p>
<p>“Unless the data deteriorates considerably, we think U.S . elections
will start to be more at the forefront,” UBS equity derivative
strategists said in a note.    </p>
<p>Investors are also looking for data to support expectations that the
economy is navigating a “soft landing,” during which inflation moderates
without badly hurting growth. Stocks fare much better after the start of
rate cuts in such a scenario, as opposed to when the Fed cuts during
recessions.  </p>
<p>The coming week includes reports on manufacturing, consumer
confidence and durable goods, as well as the personal consumption
expenditures price index, a key inflation measure.  </p>
<p>Attention will be squarely on employment after Fed Chair Jerome
Powell said the central bank wanted to stay ahead of any weakening in
the job market as the Fed announced its cut last week. The
closely-watched monthly U.S. jobs report is due on Oct 4.  </p>
<p>“We’re going to have hyper-focus on anything that speaks to the
strength of the labor force,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at
B Riley Wealth. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rally in stocks has pushed up valuations. The S&amp;P
500 has a price-to-earnings ratio of 21.4 times expected 12-month
earnings, well above its long-term average of 15.7, according to LSEG
Datastream.  </p>
<p>With the scope for valuations to go higher now more limited,
investors said that puts a greater burden on corporate earnings to be
strong in order to support stock gains.  </p>
<p>Third-quarter reporting season kicks off next month. S&amp;P 500
earnings for the period are expected to have climbed 5.4% from the prior
year, and then jump nearly 13% in the fourth quarter, according to LSEG
IBES.  </p>
<p>FedEx FDX.N shares tumbled on Friday after the delivery giant
reported a steep quarterly profit drop and lowered its full-year revenue
forecast.  </p>
<p>“Extended multiples put pressure on macro data and fundamentals to
support S&amp;P 500 prices,” Scott Chronert, head of U.S. equity
strategy at Citi, said in a report.</p>

id="more-shelter-beds-and-a-crackdown-on-tents-mean-fewer-homeless-encampments-in-san-francisco">More
shelter beds and a crackdown on tents mean fewer homeless encampments in
San Francisco</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO — Sidewalks once teeming with tents, tarps and people
passed out next to heaps of trash have largely disappeared from great
swaths of San Francisco, a city widely known for its visible homeless
population.</p>
<p>The number of people sleeping outdoors dropped to under 3,000 in
January, the lowest the city has recorded in a decade, according to a
federal count.</p>
<p>And that figure has likely dropped even lower since Mayor London
Breed — a Democrat in a difficult reelection fight this November —
started ramping up enforcement of anti-camping laws in August following
a U.S. Supreme Court decision.</p>
<p>Homelessness in no way has gone away, and in fact grew 7%, to 8,300
in January, according to the same federal count.</p>
<p>But the problem is now notably out of the public eye, raising the
question of where people have gone and whether the change marks a
turning point in a crisis long associated with San Francisco.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing much cleaner sidewalks,” said Terry Asten Bennett,
owner of Cliff’s Variety store in the city’s historically gay Castro
neighborhood, adding that she hates to see homeless people shuffled
around.</p>
<p>“But also, as a business owner, I need clean, inviting streets to
encourage people to come and shop and visit our city,” she said.</p>
<p>Advocates for homeless people say encampment sweeps that force people
off the streets are an easy way to hide homelessness from public
view.</p>
<p>“Shelter should always be transitional,” said Lukas Illa, an
organizer with San Francisco’s Coalition on Homelessness. “We shouldn’t
have folks be in there as the long-lasting solution.”</p>
<p>Other California cities have also reported a drop in visible
homelessness, thanks to improved outreach and more temporary housing.
The beach city of Santa Cruz reported a 49% decline in people sleeping
unsheltered this year, while Los Angeles recorded a 10% drop.</p>
<p>San Francisco has increased the number of shelter beds and permanent
supportive housing units by more than 50% over the past six years. At
the same time, city officials are on track to eclipse the nearly 500
sweeps conducted last year, with Breed prioritizing bus tickets out of
the city for homeless people and authorizing police to do more to stamp
out tents.</p>
<p>San Francisco police have issued at least 150 citations for illegal
lodging since Aug. 1, surpassing the 60 citations over the entire
previous three years. City crews also have removed more than 1,200 tents
and structures.</p>
<p>Tracking homeless people is extremely difficult and where all the
people once living on San Francisco’s streets have gone is impossible to
know.</p>
<p>There are still people sleeping on sidewalks, some with just a
blanket, and tents continue to crop up under freeway overpasses and more
isolated corners of the city. But tents that once sprouted outside
libraries and subway stations, and went on endlessly for blocks in the
Mission, downtown and South of Market districts, are gone. Even the
troubled Tenderloin district has seen progress.</p>
<p>Steven Burcell, who became homeless a year ago after a shoulder
injury cost him his job, moved into one of 60 new, tiny cabins in May
after the car he was living in caught fire.</p>
<p>Mission Cabins is a new type of emergency shelter that offers privacy
and allows pets. But like all shelters, it has rules. No drugs, weapons
or outside guests are allowed. Residents must consent to their rooms
being searched.</p>
<p>“At the beginning, it was rough, you know, going in and just getting
adjusted to being searched and having them look through your bags,”
acknowledged Burcell, 51.</p>
<p>His tidy 65-square-foot (6-square-meter) room contains a twin bed,
pairs of shoes lined by a door that locks and opens onto a sunny
courtyard that, on a recent morning, was filled with the voices of
children playing at the elementary school next door.</p>
<p>“To have your own space inside here and close the door, not sharing
anything with anybody,” he said, “it’s huge.”</p>
<p>But Burcell opposes encampment sweeps. He said two friends rejected
beds because they thought — inaccurately, he said — the shelter would be
infested with rodents. That did not stop crews from taking their tent
and everything inside it.</p>
<p>“Now they have nothing. They don’t have any shelter at all,” he said.
“They just kind of wander around and take buses, like a lot of people
do.”</p>
<p>Since 2018, San Francisco has added 1,800 emergency shelter beds and
nearly 5,000 permanent supportive housing units, where people pay 30% of
their income toward rent and the rest is subsidized, bringing the total
to more than 4,200 beds and 14,000 units.</p>
<p>Breed, who first won office in June 2018, can claim credit for the
expansion, although some plans were in place before she became mayor and
her administration had huge financial help.</p>
<p>The money came from the federal government battling the pandemic and
a California governor — and onetime San Francisco mayor — who made
fighting homelessness and tent encampments his priority. Gov. Gavin
Newsom has pumped at least $24 billion into the effort since taking
office in 2019, including a program to turn hotels into housing.</p>
<p>San Francisco also benefited from a controversial 2018 wealth tax on
the city’s tech titans that Breed opposed, saying companies would leave.
There was no exodus and the pandemic overshadowed any fallout.</p>
<p>The funds have helped get people off the streets and tripled the
annual budget of the San Francisco Department of Homelessness and
Supportive Housing from nearly $300 million in 2018 to $850 million this
year.</p>
<p>But the department’s budget is expected to dip below $700 million
next year, and that worries experts who say more is needed in a city
where the median price of a home is $1.4 million.</p>
<p>“We still have a housing market that is way too expensive for way too
many people. And as long as that continues to be the case, we’re going
to see folks falling into homelessness,” said Alex Visotzky, a policy
fellow with the National Alliance to End Homelessness.</p>
<p>Advocates for the homeless say that’s why city officials need to
invest in more affordable housing.</p>
<p>One such place is 835 Turk Street, a former hotel the city purchased
and reopened two years ago as supportive housing. It’s home to David
Labogin, who lost his housing after his mother died.</p>
<p>“Of course, things could be a whole lot better,” he said, sitting on
a single bed, “but from where I came from, I got no complaints.”</p>
<p>But housing takes longer to build, and converting old properties is
not cheap. The city purchased 835 Turk for $25 million and spent $18
million — twice the estimated amount — rehabilitating it.</p>
<p>Until then, shelters are adapting, accommodating couples and people
with pets.</p>
<p>It takes new residents about two weeks to adjust to the rules at
Mission Cabins, said Steve Good, CEO of operator Five Keys. “A few rules
to keep them safe is better than living on the street, where there
aren’t any rules,” he said.</p>
<p>“Amen,” said Patrick Richardson, 54, who stopped by to watch as Good
was interviewed. He was on his way to a two-year college in Oakland
where he is studying to be an X-ray technician.</p>
<p>Richardson had been sleeping on couches and pavement when an outreach
worker offered him a cabin.</p>
<p>His new home, he said, “rescued me.</p>

2.37 is out, along with bugfix releases for 2.19 through 2.36</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-22, updated: 2024-09-22, from: Newsboat News</p>
<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;
            Since 2.19, Newsboat treated HTTP code 304 (Not Modified) as
            error, and retried the download up to the limit specified by
            `download-retries`. The default for that setting is 1, so no
            harm done, but if the user changed it, Newsboat turned into a
            request-spamming machine.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            Today’s release fixes that. We’re also making point releases for
            everything starting from 2.19 all the way up to the previous
            release, 2.36. If you can upgrade to 2.37, great. If you can&#39;t,
            please, &lt;i&gt;please&lt;/i&gt; upgrade to the closest point release you can.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
            There are a bunch of other fixes and improvements in 2.37 as
            well, but they’re less important, so find them in the changelog.

shooting kills 4, wounds 17 in nightlife district in Birmingham,
Alabama</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BIRMINGHAM, Alabama — Four people were killed and 17 others injured
when multiple shooters opened fire Saturday in what police described as
a targeted “hit” on one of the people killed at a popular nightlife spot
in Birmingham, Alabama.</p>
<p>The shooting happened shortly after 11 p.m. Saturday in Five Points
South, a district filled with entertainment venues, restaurants and bars
that is often crowded on weekend nights. The mass shooting, one of
several this year in the city, unnerved residents in the area and left
city officials pleading for help to both solve the crime and address the
broader problem of gun violence.</p>
<p>“The priority is to find these shooters and get them off our
streets,” Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin said at a Sunday press
conference.</p>
<p>The shooting occurred outside Hush, a hookah and cigar lounge, in the
entertainment district. Blood stains were visible on the sidewalk
outside the venue on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>Birmingham Police Chief Scott Thurmond said authorities believe the
shooting targeted one of the people who was killed, possibly in a
murder-for-hire. He said a vehicle pulled up and “multiple shooters” got
out and began firing, then fled the scene.</p>
<p>“We believe that there was a ‘hit,’ if you will, on that particular
person,” Thurmond said.</p>
<p>Police said approximately 100 shell casings were recovered at the
scene. Thurmond said law enforcement was working to determine what
weapons were used, but they believe some of the gunfire was “fully
automatic.”  </p>
<p>Investigators were also trying to determine whether anyone fired
back, creating crossfire.</p>
<p>Police said officers found two men and a woman on a sidewalk with
gunshot wounds and they were pronounced dead there. An additional male
gunshot victim was pronounced dead at a hospital, according to
police.</p>
<p>By early Sunday, after victims began showing up at hospitals, police
had identified 17 people with injuries, some of them life-threatening.
Four of the surviving victims, in conditions ranging from good to
critical, were being treated at the University of Alabama at Birmingham
Hospital on Sunday afternoon, according to Alicia Rohan, a UAB
spokeswoman.</p>
<p>The area of Birmingham is popular with young adults because of its
proximity to the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the plethora of
nearby restaurants and bars.</p>
<p>Geoffrey Boshell, a 22-year-old biomedical engineering student who
lives nearby, said he was working on a school project when he heard a
burst of rapid pops that he said sounded like automatic gunfire.</p>
<p>“I heard it, looked out my window and immediately see people
screaming, fleeing the scene,” Boshell said.</p>
<p>The shooting in the bustling and popular area was unnerving, he said.
“I’m not sure scared is the right word. Just very disturbed that it was
happening right outside where you are living.”</p>
<p>Ashton Mills, 24, who lives in a nearby apartment complex, was headed
to work Saturday night when she heard a “bunch of popping sounds.”</p>
<p>“It’s scary, especially as a single woman walking around the city,”
she said. “I’m definitely a lot more on guard.”</p>
<p>Woodfin expressed frustration at what he described as an epidemic of
gun violence in America.</p>
<p>“We find ourselves in 2024, where gun violence is at an epidemic
level, an epidemic crisis in our country. And the city of Birmingham,
unfortunately finds itself at the tip of that spear,” he said.</p>
<p>The Birmingham mayor also urged state and federal officials to give
cities more tools to address gun violence. He put both hands behind his
back to illustrate what it is like for cities to combat crime. Alabama
last year abolished the requirement to get a permit to carry a concealed
handgun in public.</p>
<p>Woodfun said there is an “element” in the city that is too
comfortable carrying Glock switches — which convert semi-automatic
handguns to deliver more rapid fire — and assault-style rifles with the
intent of doing harm.</p>
<p>“Elected officials locally, statewide and nationally have a duty to
solve this American crisis, this American epidemic of gun violence,” the
mayor said.</p>

id="this-us-city-is-hailed-as-a-vaccination-success.-can-it-be-sustained">This
US city is hailed as a vaccination success. Can it be sustained?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOUISVILLE, Kentucky — On his first day of school at Newcomer
Academy, Maikel Tejeda was whisked to the school library. The 7th grader
didn’t know why.</p>
<p>He soon got the point: He was being given make-up vaccinations. Five
of them.</p>
<p>“I don’t have a problem with that,” said the 12-year-old, who moved
from Cuba early this year.</p>
<p>Across the library, a group of city, state and federal officials
gathered to celebrate the school clinic, and the city. With U.S.
childhood vaccination rates below their goals, Louisville and the state
were being praised as success stories: Kentucky’s vaccination rate for
kindergarteners rose 2 percentage points in the 2022-23 school year
compared with the year before. The rate for Jefferson County — which is
Louisville — was up 4 percentage points.</p>
<p>“Progress is success,” said Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>But that progress didn’t last. Kentucky’s school entry vaccination
rate slipped last year. Jefferson County’s rate slid, too. And the rates
for both the county and state remain well below the target
thresholds.</p>
<p>It raises the question: If this is what success looks like, what does
it say about the nation’s ability to stop imported infections from
turning into community outbreaks?</p>
<p>Local officials believe they can get to herd immunity thresholds, but
they acknowledge challenges that includes tight funding, misinformation
and well-intended bureaucratic rules that can discourage doctors from
giving kids shots.</p>
<p>“We’re closing the gap,” said Eva Stone, who has managed the county
school system’s health services since 2018. “We’re not closing the gap
very quickly.”</p>
<p>Falling vaccination rates</p>
<p>Public health experts focus on vaccination rates for kindergartners
because schools can be cauldrons for germs and the launching pad for
community outbreaks.</p>
<p>For years, those rates were high, thanks largely to mandates that
required key vaccinations as a condition of school attendance.</p>
<p>But they have slid in recent years. When COVID-19 started hitting the
U.S. hard in 2020, schools were closed, visits to pediatricians declined
and vaccination record-keeping fell off. Meanwhile, more parents
questioned routine childhood vaccinations that they used to
automatically accept, an effect that experts attribute to misinformation
and the political schism that emerged around COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
<p>A Gallup survey released last month found that 40% of Americans said
it is extremely important for parents to have their children vaccinated,
down from 58% in 2019. Meanwhile, a recent University of Pennsylvania
survey of 1,500 people found that about 1 in 4 U.S. adults think the
measles, mumps and rubella vaccine causes autism — despite no medical
evidence for it.</p>
<p>All that has led more parents to seek exemptions to school entry
vaccinations. The CDC has not yet reported national data for the 2023-24
school year, but the proportion of U.S. kindergartners exempted from
school vaccination requirements the year before hit a record 3%.</p>
<p>Overall, 93% of kindergartners got their required shots for the
2022-23 school year. The rate was 95% in the years before the COVID-19
pandemic.</p>
<p>Officials worry slipping vaccination rates will lead to disease
outbreaks.</p>
<p>The roughly 250 U.S. measles cases reported so far this year are the
most since 2019, and Oregon is seeing its largest outbreak in more than
30 years.</p>
<p>Kentucky has been experiencing its worst outbreak of whooping cough —
another vaccine-preventable disease — since 2017. Nationally, nearly
14,000 cases have been reported this year, the most since 2019.</p>
<p>Persuading parents</p>
<p>The whooping cough surge is a warning sign but also an opportunity,
said Kim Tolley, a California-based historian who wrote a book last year
on the vaccination of American schoolchildren. She called for a public
relations campaign to “get everybody behind” improving
immunizations.</p>
<p>Much of the discussion about raising vaccination rates centers on
campaigns designed to educate parents about the importance of
vaccinating children — especially those on the fence about getting shots
for their kids.</p>
<p>But experts are still hashing out what kind of messaging work best:
Is it better, for example, to say “vaccinate” or “immunize’’?</p>
<p>A lot of the messaging is influenced by feedback from small focus
groups. One takeaway is some people have less trust in health officials
and even their own doctors than they once did. Another is that they
strongly trust their own feelings about vaccines and what they’ve seen
in Internet searches or heard from other sources.</p>
<p>“Their overconfidence is hard to shake. It’s hard to poke holes in
it,” said Mike Perry, who ran focus groups on behalf of a group called
the Public Health Communications Collaborative.</p>
<p>But many people seem more trusting of older vaccines. And they do
seem to be at least curious about information they didn’t know,
including the history of research behind vaccines and the dangers of the
diseases they were created to fight, he said.</p>
<p>Improving access</p>
<p>Dolores Albarracin has studied vaccination improvement strategies in
17 countries, and repeatedly found that the most effective strategy is
to make it easier for kids to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>“In practice, most people are not vaccinating simply because they
don’t have money to take the bus” or have other troubles getting to
appointments, said Albarracin, director of the communication science
division within Penn’s Annenberg Public Policy Center.</p>
<p>That’s a problem in Louisville, where officials say few doctors were
providing vaccinations to children enrolled in Medicaid and fewer still
were providing shots to kids without any health insurance. An analysis a
few years ago indicated 1 in 5 children — about 20,000 kids — were not
current on their vaccinations, and most of them were poor, said Stone,
the county school health manager.</p>
<p>A 30-year-old federal program called Vaccines for Children pays for
vaccinations for children who Medicaid-eligible or lack the insurance to
cover it.</p>
<p>But in a meeting with the CDC director last month, Louisville health
officials lamented that most local doctors don’t participate in the
program because of paperwork and other administrative headaches. And it
can be tough for patients to get the time and transportation to get to
those few dozen Louisville providers who do take part.</p>
<p>The school system has tried to fill the gap. In 2019, it applied to
become a VFC provider, and gradually established vaccine clinics.</p>
<p>Last year, it held clinics at nearly all 160 schools, and it’s doing
the same thing this year. The first was at Newcomer Academy, where many
immigrant students behind on their vaccinations are started in the
school system.</p>
<p>It’s been challenging, Stone said. Funding is very limited. There are
bureaucratic obstacles, and a growing influx of children from other
countries who need shots. It takes multiple trips to a doctor or clinic
to complete some vaccine series. And then there’s the opposition —
vaccination clinic announcements tend to draw hateful social media
comments.</p>

id="refugees-in-new-hampshire-turn-to-farming-for-income-and-a-taste-of-home">Refugees
in New Hampshire turn to farming for income and a taste of home</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DUNBARTON, New Hampshire — It’s harvest time in central New
Hampshire, and one farm there appears to have been transplanted from a
distant continent.</p>
<p>Farmers balance large crates laden with vegetables on their heads
while chatting in Somali and other languages. As the sun burns away the
early morning mist, the farmers pick American staples like corn and
tomatoes as well as crops they grew up with, like okra and sorrel. Many
of the women wear vibrant orange, red and blue fabrics.</p>
<p>Most workers at this Dunbarton farm are refugees who have escaped
harrowing wars and persecution. They come from the African nations of
Burundi, Rwanda, Somalia and Congo, and they now run their own small
businesses, selling their crops to local markets as well as to friends
and connections in their ethnic communities. Farming provides them with
both an income and a taste of home.</p>
<p>“I like it in the USA. I have my own job,” says Somali refugee and
farmer Khadija Aliow as she hams it up by sashaying past a reporter,
using one hand to steady the crate of crops on her head and the other to
give a thumbs-up. “Happy. I’m so happy.”</p>
<p>The farm is owned by a New Hampshire-based nonprofit, the
Organization for Refugee and Immigrant Success, which lets the farmers
use plots of land and provides them with training and support. The
organization runs similar farms in Concord and the nearby town of
Boscawen.</p>
<p>In all, 36 people from five African countries, including South Sudan,
and the Asian nation of Nepal work on the farms. Many were farmers in
their home countries before coming to the U.S. or had previous
experience with agriculture, said Tom McGee, a program director with the
nonprofit.</p>
<p>“These are farmers who are basically independent business owners, who
are working in partnership with our organization to be able to bring
this produce to life in this country,” he said. “And to have another
sense of purpose, and a way that they can bring themselves into the
community and belong. And really participate in the American dream.”</p>
<p>The nonprofit runs a food market in Manchester, where people can buy
fresh produce or sign up to have boxes delivered. McGee said there are a
few other programs with similar aims scattered throughout the U.S. but
that the model remains relatively rare. He said his organization relies
on state and federal funding, as well as private donations.</p>
<p>Farmer Sylvain Bukasa said he escaped in 2000 from the decades-long
conflict in Congo that has resulted in millions of deaths. He spent six
years with his wife and son in a refugee camp in Tanzania before being
accepted into the U.S. in 2006.</p>
<p>“I was worried for my safety,” he said. “I decided to just go
somewhere where it’s a little bit safer.”</p>
<p>Bukasa said he has worked hard since arriving in the U.S. and
relishes his new life. But at first he missed the foods he grew up with.
He could only find them in specialized markets, where they tended to be
expensive and of poor quality.</p>
<p>“Back home we ate more vegetables and less meat,” he said. “When we
came here, it’s more chicken, more pizza, things like that. They taste
good, but it’s not good for you.”</p>
<p>Bukasa started growing crops on the farm in 2011. The initial plan on
the Dunbarton farm was to allow migrants like him to grow traditional
crops for themselves and their families. But demand grew, particularly
during the pandemic, prompting the farm’s evolution into a commercial
operation.</p>
<p>For a few of the farmers, the harvest provides their primary income.
For most, like Bukasa, it’s a side gig. He works fulltime as a service
agent for a rental car company and travels whenever he can to tend his
plot of just over 0.4 hectares. The biggest challenges are making sure
his crops are adequately watered and stopping the weeds from taking
over, he said.</p>
<p>Mondays are harvest days, and on a recent Monday, Bukasa listed the
crops he was picking: tomatoes, summer squash, zucchini, kale, corn,
okra, and the leaves from pumpkins and sorrel — which he and the other
migrants call sour-sour because of its taste.</p>
<p>He said there’s a surprisingly large Congolese community throughout
New England, and they appreciate what he grows.</p>
<p>“It’s a hard job, but hard work is good work,” Bukasa said. “It’s fun
and it helps people. I like when I satisfy people with the food that
they eat.”</p>
<p>His dream is to one day buy his own farm with a couple of acres of
land, so he can walk out his front door to tend to his crops rather than
driving 20 minutes like he does now. A more immediate challenge, he
said, is to work on the marketing side of his business.</p>
<p>He’s got to the point where he now grows more food than he’s able to
sell, and he hates seeing any of it go to waste. One idea is to buy a
van, so he can deliver more produce himself.</p>
<p>“You see the competition in there,” he says with a grin, motioning
toward the tent where other refugee farmers wash and pack their crops.
“See how many farmers are trying to sell their produce.”</p>

id="quad-leaders-move-to-create-free-and-secure-indo-pacific-at-summit-1">‘Quad’
leaders move to create ‘free and secure’ Indo-Pacific at summit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WILMINGTON, DELAWARE/WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden on
Saturday hosted the leaders of Australia, India and Japan at his private
home in the U.S. state of Delaware for his final convening of the Quad,
a strategic security grouping focused on the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>But it was Biden’s comments, unintentionally heard by the press, that
illuminated the main topic at this unusually private meeting – and that
topic was China.</p>
<p>Biden said his administration reads Beijing’s recent actions,
including flexing its territorial muscles, as a “change in tactic, not a
change in strategy.”</p>
<p>“We believe [Chinese President] Xi Jinping is looking to focus on
domestic economic challenges and minimize the turbulence in China’s
diplomatic relationships, and he’s also looking to buy himself some
diplomatic space, in my view, to aggressively pursue China’s interests,”
Biden told the other three leaders in what he said were prepared
remarks.</p>
<p>“China continues to behave aggressively, testing this all across the
region, and it’s true in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, South
China, South Asia and the Taiwan Straits. It’s true across the scope of
our relationship, including in economic and technology issues,” he
added.</p>
<p>Beijing claims almost all of the South China Sea, including territory
claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. It also claims
territories in the East China Sea contested by Japan and Taiwan. It
views democratically governed Taiwan as part of China.</p>
<p>Publicly, Biden’s message was shorter, simpler – “The Quad is here to
stay.”</p>
<p>Those six words were also the final sentence of a lengthy joint
statement from Biden and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese,
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio
Kishida. The group issued their nearly 5,700-word missive after a day of
meetings so cloistered that the president of the White House
Correspondents’ Association called the lack of access
“unacceptable.”</p>
<p>In their statement, the quartet announced moves they say will boost
cooperation among the four democracies and address concerns beyond their
borders in the massive region, home to more than half of the world’s
population and two-thirds of its economy. While they used the word
“China” sparingly – only three times, and all three times in reference
to the South China Sea – they made very clear how their stance differs
from Beijing’s.</p>
<p>“As four leading maritime democracies in the Indo-Pacific, we
unequivocally stand for the maintenance of peace and stability across
this dynamic region, as an indispensable element of global security and
prosperity,” they said.</p>
<p>“We strongly oppose any destabilizing or unilateral actions that seek
to change the status quo by force or coercion. We condemn recent illicit
missile launches in the region that violate U.N. Security Council
resolutions. We express serious concern over recent dangerous and
aggressive actions in the maritime domain. We seek a region where no
country dominates and no country is dominated — one where all countries
are free from coercion and can exercise their agency to determine their
futures.”</p>
<p>China has previously called out the Quad for its thinly veiled
criticisms of China, with a Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson in
July comparing the grouping to “exclusive clubs that undermine trust and
cooperation among regional countries.”</p>
<p>Biden spoke briefly to tout the major steps, including one that aims
to strengthen maritime security, and that will inevitably affect China’s
maritime presence in others’ waters.</p>
<p>“We’re announcing a series of initiatives to deliver real, positive
impact for the Indo-Pacific that includes providing new maritime
technologies to our regional partners, so they know what’s happening in
their waters, launching cooperation between coast guards for the first
time, and expanding the Quad fellowship to include students from
Southeast Asia,” Biden said.</p>
<p>That includes, the leaders’ statement said, a 2025 joint mission by
the four nations’ coast guards. That step is also something that
Japanese officials presented as a big summit takeaway when briefing
reporters earlier in the day. Earlier in the week, when a top U.S.
officials previewed the summit, he said the aim is to counter illegal
fishing – adding, tellingly, that the vast majority of illegal fishing
vessels are Chinese.</p>
<p>VOA asked the Japanese officials about a point of contention between
Washington and Tokyo: Biden’s opposition, on national security grounds,
to a proposed takeover of U.S. Steel by Nippon Steel. Biden
administration officials appeared to play down the matter, noting that
the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States recently
extended its review into the deal, pushing any decision past
November.</p>
<p>“The president will obviously allow that process to run its course
because that’s what’s required from the law, and then we will see what
happens,” Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, told
reporters Saturday.</p>
<p>The American steel company is headquartered in Pennsylvania, an
electorally critical state in the fast-approaching U.S. presidential
election.</p>
<p>VOA asked the Japanese government to share Toyko’s position on the
politically sensitive merger. Japanese officials would not say whether
Biden and Kishida even planned to speak on this topic in any of their
meetings.</p>
<p>“As a government we refrain from commenting on that,” replied a
Foreign Affairs Ministry official, who briefed reporters on condition of
anonymity. The official quickly added that Japan is the No. 1 investor
in the U.S., and that Tokyo hopes the countries’ cooperation will
continue.</p>
<p>Australia’s leader said it matters that the four “like-minded
countries,” all democracies, work together.</p>
<p>“We assert the view that national sovereignty is important, that
security and stability is something that we strive for, as well as
shared prosperity in our region,” Albanese said.</p>
<p>Analysts had predicted China discussion would dominate behind the
scenes, but the leaders would refrain from publicly poking Beijing.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t show up in the readouts,” Rafiq Dossani, a longtime
Asia scholar, told VOA ahead of the summit.</p>
<p>The four leaders began to meet yearly, in person, under Biden’s
presidency. Much of their effort, said analyst Kathryn Paik of the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, is directed at
bread-and-butter governance issues such as health, infrastructure,
maritime security and resources, and people-to-people ties.</p>
<p>“This is certainly not a Contain-China club,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>But, said Dossani, who is a senior economist at the Rand research
corporation and a professor of policy analysis, there is room for the
Quad to evolve.</p>
<p>“The question is as the competition, or the rivalry, between China
and the U.S. evolves, how will that at that time affect the
deliberations?” he said. “As the Chinese economy recovers and they
become more assertive, then you’ll see a different context for the
dialogue.”</p>
<p>In the present, though, Biden sees this dialogue among the four
leaders as important to his legacy, Paik said.</p>
<p>“It was a central piece to the Indo-Pacific strategy, and elevating
the Quad to the leader level has been a significant piece of that
strategy,” she said. “Just the fact that the Quad has met annually at
the leader level every year of Biden’s administration is quite
significant.”</p>

Lewis, in Washington, contributed to this report.</p>

id="fbi-agents-board-vessel-managed-by-company-whose-ship-crashed-into-us-bridge">FBI
agents board vessel managed by company whose ship crashed into US
bridge</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BALTIMORE — Federal agents on Saturday boarded a vessel managed by
the same company that managed a cargo ship that caused a deadly bridge
collapse in Baltimore, Maryland, the FBI confirmed.</p>
<p>In statements, spokespeople for the FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s
Office in Maryland confirmed that authorities boarded the Maersk
Saltoro. The ship is managed by Synergy Marine Group.</p>
<p>“The Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency’s Criminal Investigation Division and Coast Guard Investigative
Services are present aboard the Maersk Saltoro conducting court
authorized law enforcement activity,” statements from both the FBI and
U.S. Attorney’s Office said Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Authorities did not offer further specifics. The Washington Post
first reported on federal authorities boarding the ship.</p>
<p>The raid came several months after investigators conducted a similar
search of the Dali, the cargo ship that crashed into the bridge.</p>
<p>In a lawsuit filed Wednesday, the U.S. Justice Department alleged
that Dali owner Grace Ocean Private Ltd. and manager Synergy Marine,
both of Singapore, recklessly cut corners and ignored known electrical
problems on the vessel, which lost power multiple times minutes before
it crashed into a support column on the Francis Scott Key Bridge in
March.</p>
<p>The Justice Department said mechanical and electrical systems on the
massive ship had been “jury-rigged” and improperly maintained,
culminating in the power outages and a cascade of other failures that
left its pilots and crew helpless in the face of looming disaster. The
ship was leaving Baltimore for Sri Lanka when its steering failed
because of the power loss.</p>
<p>Six members of a road work crew were killed when the bridge crumbled
into the water. The collapse also snarled commercial shipping traffic
through the Port of Baltimore for months before the channel was fully
reopened in June.</p>
<p>The Justice Department is seeking to recover more than $100 million
the government spent to clear the underwater debris and reopen the
city’s port.</p>
<p>The companies filed a court petition days after the collapse seeking
to limit their legal liability in what could become the most expensive
marine casualty case in history.</p>
<p>Justice Department officials said there is no legal support for that
bid to limit liability and pledged to vigorously contest it.</p>
<p>In its lawsuit, which also seeks punitive damages, the Justice
Department argued that vessel owners and operators need to be “deterred
from engaging in such reckless and exceedingly harmful behavior.”</p>
<p>That includes Grace Ocean and Synergy themselves because the Dali has
a “sister ship,” authorities wrote in the claim.</p>
<p>The two companies “need to be deterred because they continue to
operate their vessels, including a sister ship to the Dali, in U.S.
waters and benefit economically from those activities,” the lawsuit
says.</p>
<p>Darrell Wilson, a Grace Ocean spokesperson, confirmed that the FBI
and Coast Guard boarded the Maersk Saltoro in the Port of Baltimore on
Saturday morning. Wilson has previously said the owner and manager “look
forward to our day in court to set the record straight.”</p>
<p>Like the Dali, the Singapore-flagged Saltoro was built by Hyundai in
2015.</p>
<p>According to the Justice Department lawsuit, major issues with the
Dali’s electrical system might have resulted from excessive vibrations
on the ship that can loosen wires and damage connections. A prior
captain of the vessel had reported “heavy vibration” in his handover
notes in May 2023, saying he had made similar reports to Synergy in the
past, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>The lawsuit noted cracked equipment in the engine room and pieces of
cargo shaken loose. The ship’s electrical equipment was in such bad
condition that an independent agency stopped further electrical testing
because of safety concerns, according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>The ship had also experienced power outages while it was still docked
in Baltimore. Those blackouts are considered “reportable marine
casualties” that must be reported to the U.S. Coast Guard, which
authorities say never happened.</p>
<p>The Dali, which was stuck amid the wreckage of the collapse for
months before it could be extricated and refloated, departed Norfolk,
Virginia, on Thursday afternoon en route to China on its first
international voyage since the March 26 disaster.</p>
<p>Justice Department officials refused to answer questions Wednesday
about whether a criminal investigation into the bridge collapse remains

<p>I’ve been on a bit of a frustration-driven quest to solve a problem I
frequently encounter working on the search engine, that is, reading data
from disk. You’d think this would be a pretty basic thing, but doing
this in a way that is half-way performant is surprisingly hard and
requires avoiding basically all the high level tools at your disposal.
There’s a common sentiment that modern hardware is fast, so this may not
matter, but we aren’t speaking a 30% performance hit, the the question
is how many orders of magnitude you’re willing to forego.</p>

Distributed PostgreSQL: The Next Generation — Introducing pgEdge
Platform v24.7, Constellation Release</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-22, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
pgEdge has just released the latest version of its flagship product,
pgEdge Platform v24.7, known as the Constellation Release. This update
brings a host of new features designed to enhance the capabilities of
distributed PostgreSQL databases. Building on its foundation as the only
fully distributed PostgreSQL that is open (source code available) and
based on standard PostgreSQL, pgEdge continues to lead the way in
providing ultra-high availability and reduced latency across geographic
regions. The Constellation Release introduces significant improvements,
including advanced logical replication features, large object support,
and enhanced error handling. These enhancements make pgEdge an even more
powerful alternative for legacy multi-master replication technologies,
offering greater throughput, flexibility, and control for users.
</p>
<p>
Key Enhancements in the Constellation Release 1. Large Object Logical
Replication (LOLOR): With the new Large Object Logical Replication
(LOLOR) feature, pgEdge ensures seamless integration for applications
that store media assets and large files in PostgreSQL databases. This
extension allows large objects to be compatible with logical
replication, facilitating smoother transitions from legacy databases to
PostgreSQL without requiring application modifications. See blog for
more details.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Replication Exception Handling and Logging: The latest update includes
an advanced error handling and logging mechanism. Replication errors are
logged into a new exception table, preventing disruptions in replication
processes. This enhancement ensures a robust user experience, offering
greater visibility and control over replication errors and making
troubleshooting more straightforward.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Replication Repair Mode: pgEdge now allows users to enable or disable
“repair mode,” providing the flexibility to manage replication processes
without affecting the entire database cluster. This feature is
particularly useful for controlling replication changes during error
resolution or node-specific modifications.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Automatic Replication of DDL Commands: Updating the database schema has
never been easier. With the automatic replication of DDL commands, any
changes made to a single node are propagated across all nodes in the
cluster. This feature simplifies the management of distributed
PostgreSQL applications, especially during active development or
maintenance. See blog for more details.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Snowflake Sequence in Postgres Extension: To enhance sequence management
in multi-master replication scenarios, pgEdge integrates Snowflake
sequences within PostgreSQL. This extension ensures unique sequence
numbers across different regions without needing application code or
schema modifications, streamlining sequence management and improving
scalability. See blog for details and examples.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Looking Ahead: High Performance Parallel Replication pgEdge is set to
introduce Parallel Replication in Q4 of this year. This feature will
leverage multiple replication slots to enable parallel processing within
distributed PostgreSQL clusters, significantly boosting replication
throughput. It promises to reduce replication lag, ensuring timely data
synchronization across nodes and maintaining data consistency even in
high-demand environments.
</p>
<p>
Availability and Support The pgEdge Platform can be self-hosted
on-premise or self-managed in the cloud with providers like AWS,
Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. The new Constellation
Release is available for download at
<a href="https://www.pgedge.com/get-started/platform">https://www.pgedge.com/get-started/platform</a>
or can be accessed via GitHub. pgEdge also offers enterprise-class
support. Additionally, pgEdge Cloud, a fully managed service based on
the pgEdge Platform, is available in beta and will be generally
available in Q3.

id="in-final-months-in-office-biden-puts-personal-touch-on-asia-pacific-diplomacy">In
final months in office, Biden puts personal touch on Asia-Pacific
diplomacy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WILMINGTON, Delaware — U.S. President Joe Biden is showcasing the
Indo-Pacific partnership he has nurtured since taking office as he hosts
the leaders of Australia, Japan and India in his hometown Saturday with
an eye on his legacy as well. </p>
<p>When Biden entered the White House, he looked to elevate the
so-called Quad, which until then had only met at the foreign minister
level, to a leader-level partnership as he tried to pivot U.S. foreign
policy away from conflicts in the Middle East and toward threats and
opportunities in the Indo-Pacific. This weekend’s summit is the fourth
in-person and sixth overall gathering of the leaders since 2021. </p>
<p>Biden put a personal touch on the engagement — potentially the last
of the group before he leaves office on January 20 — by opening his home
in Wilmington, Delaware, to each of the leaders and hosting a joint
meeting and formal dinner at the high school he attended more than 60
years ago. </p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Indian Prime Minister
Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida came for the
meetings before their appearances at the United Nations General Assembly
in New York next week. </p>
<p>“You guys have heard the president say many times that all politics
is personal, all diplomacy is personal,” White House national security
adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters as meetings were set to get
underway. </p>
<p>“And developing personal relationships has been core to his approach
to foreign policy as president. So, opening his home to the leaders of
India, Japan and Australia is a way of him showing, not just saying, but
these leaders matter to him.” </p>
<p>Biden welcomes Albanese to his home</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon, Biden welcomed Albanese to his home on a pond in
a wooded area several miles west of downtown. Saturday’s agenda included
hosting Kishida and Modi and bringing all the leaders together for talks
at Archmere Academy in nearby Claymont. </p>
<p>Sullivan described the vibe of the meeting with Albanese as “two guys
— one at the other guy’s home — talking in broad strokes about where
they see the state of the world.” He said Biden and Albanese also
swapped stories about their political careers. </p>
<p>Reporters and photographers were prohibited from covering Biden’s
individual meetings with the leaders, and Biden does not plan to do a
news conference — a question-and-answer appearance that is typical at
such international summits. </p>
<p>As part of the summit, the leaders were set to announce new
initiatives to bolster maritime security in the region — with enhanced
coast guard collaboration through the Pacific and Indian oceans — and
improve cooperation on humanitarian response missions. The measures are
meant to serve as a counterweight to an increasingly assertive
China. </p>
<p>Sullivan said he expected Biden and Modi would discuss Modi’s recent
visits to Russia and Ukraine as well as economic and security concerns
about China. Modi is the most prominent leader from a nation that
maintains a neutral position on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. </p>
<p>Sullivan said Biden would underscore “that countries like India
should step up and support the principles of sovereignty and territorial
integrity” and that “every country, everywhere, should refrain from
supplying inputs to Russia’s war machine.” </p>
<p>Biden, Kishida say farewell</p>
<p>The gathering was also an opportunity for Biden and Japan’s Kishida
to bid each other farewell. Biden and Kishida, who are both stepping
away from office amid sliding public support, count the tightening of
security and economic ties among the U.S., Japan and South Korea as one
of their most significant accomplishments. The two leaders sat down for
their wide-ranging, one-on-one conversation on Saturday morning. </p>
<p>The improved relations between Japan and South Korea, two nations
with a deep and complicated history that have struggled to stay on
speaking terms, have come amid worrying developments in the Pacific,
including strides made by North Korea in its nuclear program and
increasing Chinese assertiveness. </p>
<p>Biden commended Kishida for demonstrating “courage and conviction in
strengthening ties” with South Korea, according to the White House. They
also discussed China’s “coercive and destabilizing activities” in the
Pacific, Russia’s war against Ukraine, and emerging technology
issues. </p>
<p>The U.S. and Japan are negotiating through a rare moment of tension
in the relationship. Biden, as well as presidential candidates Kamala
Harris and Donald Trump, have opposed a $15 billion bid by Japan’s
Nippon Steel to take over American-owned U.S. Steel. </p>
<p>Biden administration officials indicated this week that a U.S.
government committee’s formal assessment of the proposed deal has yet to
be submitted to the White House and may not come until after the
November 5 election. </p>
<p>Sullivan pushed back against speculation that the expected timing of
the report could suggest Biden is having second thoughts about his
opposition to the deal. </p>
<p>The Biden administration promised that the leaders would issue a
joint statement containing the strongest-ever language on China and
North Korea to be agreed upon by the four countries. </p>
<p>The White House said the leaders would also roll out an announcement
related to Biden’s Cancer Moonshot Initiative, a long-running passion
project of the president and his wife, Jill Biden, aimed at reducing
cancer deaths. The Bidens’ son Beau died in 2015 at age 46 of brain
cancer. </p>
<p>White House officials said the leaders will unveil details about a
new collaboration aimed at reducing cervical cancer in the
Indo-Pacific. </p>
<p>As Biden’s time in office draws down, the White House also was
celebrating the bipartisan, bicameral formation of a “Quad Caucus” in
Congress meant to ensure the longevity of the partnership regardless of
the outcome of the November election.</p>

id="zelenskyy-will-visit-us-ammunition-factory-to-thank-workers">Zelenskyy
will visit US ammunition factory to thank workers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday will
visit the U.S. ammunition factory that is producing one of the most
critically needed munitions for Ukraine’s fight to fend off Russian
ground forces. </p>
<p>Zelenskyy is expected to go to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in
the state of Pennsylvania to kick off a busy week in the United States
shoring up support for Ukraine in the war, according to two U.S.
officials and a third familiar with Zelenskyy’s schedule who spoke on
the condition of anonymity to provide details that were not yet
public.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian leader also will address the United Nations General
Assembly annual gathering in New York and travel to Washington for talks
on Thursday with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala
Harris. </p>
<p>The Scranton plant is one of the few facilities in the country to
manufacture 155 mm artillery shells. They are used in howitzer systems,
which are towed large guns with long barrels that can fire at various
angles. Howitzers can strike targets up to 15- 20 miles (24-32
kilometers) away and are highly valued by ground forces to take out
enemy targets from a protected distance. </p>
<p>Ukraine has already received more than 3 million of the 155 mm shells
from the U.S. </p>
<p>Still pushing for permission</p>
<p>With the war now well into its third year, Zelenskyy has been pushing
the U.S. for permission to use longer range missile systems to fire
deeper inside of Russia. </p>
<p>So far he has not persuaded the Pentagon or White House to loosen
those restrictions. The Defense Department has emphasized that Ukraine
can already hit Moscow with Ukrainian-produced drones, and there is
hesitation on the strategic implications of a U.S.-made missile
potentially striking the Russian capital. </p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Russia would be “at
war” with the United States and its NATO allies if they allow Ukraine to
use the long-range weapons. </p>
<p>At one point in the war, Ukraine was firing between 6,000 and 8,000
of the 155 mm shells per day. That rate started to deplete U.S.
stockpiles and drew concern that the level on hand was not enough to
sustain U.S. military needs if another major conventional war broke out,
such as a potential conflict over Taiwan. </p>
<p>In response, the U.S. has invested in restarting production lines and
is now manufacturing more than 40,000 155 mm rounds a month, with plans
to hit 100,000 rounds a month. During his visit, Zelenskyy is expected
meet and thank workers who have increased production of the 155 mm
rounds over the past year. </p>
<p>Two of the Pentagon leaders who have pushed that increased production
through — Doug Bush, assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition,
logistics and technology, and Bill LaPlante, the Pentagon’s top weapons
buyer — are also expected to join Zelenskyy at the plant, as is Josh
Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>US largest donor of aid</p>
<p>The 155 mm rounds are among the scores of ammunition, missile, air
defense and advanced weapons systems the U.S. has provided Ukraine —
everything from small arms bullets to advanced F-16 fighter jets. The
U.S. has been the largest donor to Ukraine, providing more than $56
billion of the more than $106 billion NATO and partner countries have
collected to aid in its defense. </p>
<p>Even though Ukraine is not a member of NATO, commitment to its
defense is seen by many European nations as a must to keep Putin from
further military aggression that could threaten bordering NATO-member
countries and result in a much larger conflict.</p>

governor signs law to protect children from social media addiction</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SACRAMENTO, California — California will make it illegal for social
media platforms to knowingly provide addictive feeds to children without
parental consent beginning in 2027 under a new law Governor Gavin Newsom
signed Friday. </p>
<p>California follows New York state, which passed a law earlier this
year allowing parents to block their kids from getting social media
posts suggested by a platform’s algorithm. Utah has passed laws in
recent years aimed at limiting children’s access to social media, but
those have faced challenges in court. </p>
<p>The California law will take effect in a state home to some of the
largest technology companies in the world. Similar proposals have failed
to pass in recent years, but Newsom signed a first-in-the-nation law in
2022 barring online platforms from using users’ personal information in
ways that could harm children. </p>
<p>It is part of a growing push in states across the country to try to
address the impact of social media on the well-being of children. </p>
<p>“Every parent knows the harm social media addiction can inflict on
their children — isolation from human contact, stress and anxiety, and
endless hours wasted late into the night,” Newsom, a Democrat, said in a
statement. “With this bill, California is helping protect children and
teenagers from purposely designed features that feed these destructive
habits.” </p>
<p>The law bans platforms from sending notifications without permission
from parents to minors between midnight and 6 a.m., and between 8 a.m.
and 3 p.m. on weekdays from September through May, when children are
typically in school. The legislation also makes platforms set children’s
accounts to private by default. </p>
<p>Opponents of the legislation say it could inadvertently prevent
adults from accessing content if they cannot verify their age. Some
argue it would threaten online privacy by making platforms collect more
information on users. </p>
<p>The law defines an “addictive feed” as a website or app “in which
multiple pieces of media generated or shared by users are, either
concurrently or sequentially, recommended, selected, or prioritized for
display to a user based, in whole or in part, on information provided by
the user, or otherwise associated with the user or the user’s device,”
with some exceptions. </p>
<p>The subject garnered renewed attention in June when U.S. Surgeon
General Vivek Murthy called on Congress to require warning labels on
social media platforms and their impacts on young people. Attorneys
general in 42 states endorsed the plan in a letter sent to Congress last
week. </p>
<p>State Senator Nancy Skinner, a Democrat representing Berkeley who
wrote the California law, said that “social media companies have
designed their platforms to addict users, especially our kids.” </p>
<p>“With the passage of SB 976, the California Legislature has sent a
clear message: When social media companies won’t act, it’s our
responsibility to protect our kids,” she said in a statement.</p>

id="parts-of-us-midwest-could-offer-falls-most-vibrant-foliage">Parts of
US Midwest could offer fall’s most vibrant foliage</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PORTLAND, Maine — Fall is back, and bringing with it
jack-o’-lanterns, football, pumpkin spice everything and — in some parts
of the country — especially vibrant foliage.</p>
<p>Leaves around the northern United States are starting to turn orange,
yellow and red, inspiring legions of leaf lovers to hop in their cars
and travel to the countryside for the best look at fall’s fireworks.
Leaf peeping — the act of traveling to witness nature’s annual
kaleidoscope — contributes billions of dollars to the economy,
especially in New England and New York.</p>
<p>But this year, some of the most colorful displays could be in the
Midwest. AccuWeather, the commercial forecasting service, said in early
September that it expects especially vibrant foliage in states such as
Michigan and Illinois.</p>
<p>The service also said powerful, popping colors are expected in
upstate New York and parts of Pennsylvania, while New England will
follow a more typical color pattern. But that doesn’t mean New England
travelers will miss out.</p>
<p>Maine, the most forested state in the country, had “an abundance of
daily sunshine with just the right amount of rainfall to set the stage
for a breathtaking foliage season,” said Gale Ross, the state’s fall
foliage spokesperson. Color change and timing depend on the weather in
the fall, but cooler nighttime temperatures and shorter days should
enhance the colors, Ross said.</p>
<p>“The growing season of 2024 has been excellent for trees, supporting
tree health and resilience that should lead to brilliant fall colors
throughout Maine,” said Aaron Bergdahl, the state’s forest
pathologist.</p>
<p>Fall colors peak at different times around the U.S., with the foliage
season sometimes starting not long after Labor Day in the far northern
reaches of the country and extending into November further to the south.
In Maine alone, peak foliage can arrive in the northern part of the
state in late September and not arrive in coastal areas until close to
Halloween.</p>
<p>Leaf turn happens when summer yields to fall and temperatures drop
and the amount of sunlight decreases. Chlorophyll in leaves then breaks
down, and that allows their fall colors to shine through before leaf
drop.</p>
<p>However, weather conditions associated with climate change have
disrupted some recent leaf peeping seasons. A warming planet has brought
drought that causes leaves to turn brown and wither before reaching peak
colors.</p>
<p>Other enemies of leaf peeping include heat waves that cause leaves to
fall before autumn arrives and extreme weather events like hurricanes
that strip trees of their leaves. A summer heatwave in the Pacific
Northwest in 2021 caused a condition called “foliage scorch” that
prematurely browned leaves.</p>
<p>This year in Maine, leaf turn was still very sparse in most of the
state as late September approached, but the state office of tourism was
already gearing up for an influx of tourists. Northern Maine was already
experiencing moderate color change. And neighboring New Hampshire was
expecting about 3.7 million visitors — more than twice the state’s
population.</p>
<p>“It’s no surprise people travel from all over the world to catch the
incredible color,” said New Hampshire Travel and Tourism Director Lori
Harnois.</p>

<h2 id="climate-protesters-say-pace-of-change-isnt-fast-enough">Climate
protesters say pace of change isn’t fast enough</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Six years after a teenage Greta Thunberg walked out of
school in a solitary climate protest outside of the Swedish parliament,
people around a warming globe marched in youth-led protest, saying their
voices are being heard but not sufficiently acted upon.</p>
<p>Emissions of heat-trapping gases and temperatures have been rising
and oil and gas drilling has continued, even as the protests that kicked
off major weeklong climate events in New York City have become annual
events. This year, they come days before the United Nations convenes two
special summits, one concentrating on sea level rise and the other on
the future.</p>
<p>The young people who organized these marches with Fridays for Future
said there is frustration with inaction but also hope. People marched in
Berlin, Rio de Janeiro, New Delhi and elsewhere, but the focus often is
in New York City because of Climate Week NYC. Diplomats, business
leaders and activists are concentrating their discussions on the money
end of fighting climate change — something not lost on protesters.</p>
<p>“We hope that the government and the financial sector make polluters
pay for the damage that they have imposed on our environment,” said
Uganda Fridays for Future founder Hilda Flavia Nakabuye, who was among a
few hundred marching in New York Friday, a far cry from the tens of
thousands that protested in a multigroup mega-rally in 2023.</p>
<p>The New York protest wants to take aim at “the pillars of fossil
fuels” — companies that pollute, banks that fund them and leaders who
are failing on climate, said Helen Mancini, an organizer and a senior at
the city’s Stuyvesant High School.</p>
<p>“A lot of older people want to make sure the economy is intact, and
that’s their main concern,” said Julia Demairo, a sophomore at Pace
University. “I think worrying about the future and the environment is
worrying about the economy.”</p>
<p>On a day that was at least 8 degrees warmer than average, protest
signs included “This is not what we mean by Hot Girl Summer,” while
others focused on the theme of fighting the coal, oil and gas
industries: “Youth Didn’t Vote for Fossil Fuels,” “Don’t Be a Fossil
Fool” and “Climate Crisis = Extermination By Capitalism.”</p>
<p>Nakabuye said she was in New York to represent Uganda “that is
bearing the brunt of the climate crisis.”</p>
<p>“We feel like we are creating an impact in the community. However, we
are not listened to enough; there is more that needs to be done,
especially right now when the climate catastrophes are intensifying,”
said Nakabuye. “We need to even raise our voices more to demand change
and to demand that fuels should end.”</p>
<p>In the six years since Thunberg founded what became Fridays for
Future, global carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels
have increased by about 2.15%, according to Global Carbon Project, a
group of scientists who monitor carbon pollution.</p>
<p>The growth of emissions has slowed compared with previous decades and
experts anticipate peaking soon, but that’s a far cry from the 43%
reduction that a U.N. report said is needed to keep temperature
increases to an agreed-upon limit.</p>
<p>Since 2019, carbon dioxide emissions from coal have increased by
nearly 900 million metric tons, while natural gas emissions have
increased slightly and oil pollution has dropped a tiny amount,
according to the International Energy Agency, or IEA. That growth has
been driven by China, India and developing nations.</p>
<p>But emissions from advanced or industrialized economies have been
falling and in 2023 were the lowest in more than 50 years, according to
the IEA. Coal emissions in rich countries are down to levels seen around
the year 1900, and the United Kingdom next month is set to shutter its
last coal plant.</p>
<p>In the past five years, clean energy sources have grown twice as fast
as fossil fuels, with solar and wind individually growing faster than
fossil fuel-based electricity, according to the IEA. Developing
countries — where more than 80% of the world population lives — say that
they need financial help to curb their increasing use of fossil
fuels.</p>
<p>Since 2018, the globe has warmed more than 0.29 degrees Celsius, with
last year setting a record for the hottest year and this year poised to
break that mark, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration and the European climate agency Copernicus.</p>
<p>“We’re making progress, even if it’s slow progress,” said 17-year-old
Ashen Harper of Connecticut, a veteran protester turned organizer. “Our
job right now is to accelerate that progress.”</p>
<p>In Berlin, hundreds of people took to the streets, although in fewer
numbers than in previous years. Activists held up signs saying, “Save
the Climate” and “Coal is Over!” as they watched a gig put on outside
the German Chancellor’s Office. Protesters in London held up letters
spelling out “Pay Up,” calling for the country to pay more to adapt to
climate change and transition away from fossil fuels.</p>

id="volunteer-network-of-interpreters-hopes-to-make-refugees-languages-more-accessible-via-ai">Volunteer
network of interpreters hopes to make refugees’ languages more
accessible via AI</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — They may be Tigrinya speakers fleeing the authoritarian
Eritrean government’s indefinite military service policy. Or Rohingya
people escaping ethnic violence in Myanmar. But refugees navigating
resettlement often face a shared hurdle: poor machine translations and a
short supply of interpreters knowledgeable in their less-serviced
languages.</p>
<p>Tarjimly, a Google-backed nonprofit described as “Uber for
translators,” aims to help asylum seekers clear that hurdle. Through a
new artificial intelligence partnership, Tarjimly trains outside large
language models while allowing its volunteers to respond more urgently
to needs for translators. It’s a feedback loop where humans teach the
nuances of each language to the machines by sharing data from one-on-one
calls and correcting automated translations.</p>
<p>And it’s this uniquely human realm of language that Tarjimly
co-founder Atif Javed believes exemplifies the ever-tricky balance
between individuals’ ingenuity and technological advancement. He says
it’s the needed personal touch that shows why AI’s rapid development
shouldn’t generally stoke widespread fears.</p>
<p>Languages popular in the Global South — such as the Dari and Pashto
commonly spoken in Afghanistan, home to one of the world’s largest
protracted refugee crises — have the worst quality coverage, according
to Javed. He feels well positioned to supplement the internet’s
English-dominated information troves that train services like Google
Translate with his mobile app’s more diverse data sets.</p>
<p>Tarjimly connects refugees with on-demand interpreters, who can
communicate during meetings with social workers, immigration officials
and doctors, and records the encounters for AI training. To comply with
patient privacy protections, Tarjimly anonymizes the conversations on
its app. Javed said the nonprofit also has on option for “no record”
sessions where none of the data is stored for alternative uses.</p>
<p>Many of its 60,000 volunteers are multilingual refugees themselves
who more intimately understand not only their counterpart’s native
tongue but also the crisis that brought them there, according to
Javed.</p>
<p>Among them is Roza Tesfazion, a 26-year-old Eritrean refugee who
works professionally as an interpreter for the United Kingdom’s
government. Fluent in Amharic and Tigrinya, she studied English and
Swahili to help her immigrant family overcome language barriers when
they first moved to Kenya.</p>
<p>Tesfazion said she translates at no cost because she knows “how
emotional it is” for the people on the other side of her sessions.</p>
<p>“You have to have that touch of human emotions to it,” she said.</p>
<p>Tarjimly’s founders say their mission’s sensitive nature lends itself
to nonprofit status more than a corporate structure. Users arrive in
very vulnerable positions, and the nonprofit works with established
humanitarian groups including Catholic Charities, the International
Rescue Committee and the United Nations’ International Organization for
Migration.</p>
<p>The work requires a level of trust that would have been difficult to
earn in a “for-profit, competitive world,” according to Javed. “The
underlying engine of our success is the community we’ve built.”</p>
<p>That community, however, also has room for artificial intelligence. A
$1.3 million grant from Google.org has enabled a “First Pass” tool that
gives an instantly generated translation for human volunteers to revise.
A new information hub will open up its language data for partners,
including Google, in early 2025.</p>
<p>But refining a more diverse library of languages will require
conversational data at a scale much broader than Tarjimly can likely
provide on its own, according to Data &amp; Society researcher Ranjit
Singh.</p>
<p>Singh, who studies the social implications of automation and
inclusive digital solutions, said translation services will always need
a “real person in the middle.”</p>
<p>“There is one part of it which is translation and another part of it
which is just trying to understand somebody’s life situation,” he said.
“Technologies help us do some of this work. But at the same time, it’s
also fairly social.”</p>
<p>Tarjimly was inspired by Javed’s time volunteering with Arabic
speakers at refugee camps in Greece and Turkey after graduating from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and working in Silicon Valley. A
Muslim American whose family immigrated to the United States in 2001,
Javed said he was reminded of his own childhood translating for his
refugee grandmother.</p>
<p>His lived experience is one reason why Elevate Prize Foundation CEO
Carolina Garcìa Jayaram said her organization awarded $300,000 last year
to Tarjimly. That “proximate leadership” helps nonprofits better
understand developments like artificial intelligence that “can be both
cause for excitement and trepidation,” Jayaram said. The risk-averse
philanthropic sector may be slow to catch up with disruptive new
technologies, she noted, but shouldn’t ignore their positive
applications.</p>
<p>“It’s a great example of how not to get stuck in that bogeyman
complex about AI,” she said. “To go to leaders who are closest to those
issues and say, ‘How would AI unlock the possibilities and opportunities
for your organization?’”</p>

of Springfield, Ohio, wait for political firestorm to blow over</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SPRINGFIELD, Ohio — In the quiet corners of Springfield, Ohio — out
of sight of the drumbeat of politicians and journalists, troopers and
newly installed security cameras — the people who live here are taking a
breath, praying and attempting to carry on.</p>
<p>Between the morning bomb sweeps of Springfield’s schools and the near
daily afternoon media briefings, a hush comes over the city of 58,000
that residents say is uncanny, haunting even. It’s fear. It’s confusion
— dismay at being transformed overnight into a target for the nation’s
vitriol.</p>
<p>Pastor Andy Mobley, who runs the Family Needs Inc. food pantry on the
city’s south side, said people are hunkered down out of the public eye.
He said they’re hoping the attention sparked by former President Donald
Trump spreading unsubstantiated rumors about the city’s legal Haitian
immigrants eating house pets during last week’s presidential debate will
blow over.</p>
<p>Trump and his vice presidential running mate, Ohio’s junior Sen. JD
Vance, have used the cat-eating rumors to draw attention to the city’s
15,000 Haitian immigrants, whose arrival to fill manufacturing,
distribution and warehouse jobs has put a severe strain on local
resources.</p>
<p>Since the Republican candidates’ initial comments, more than two
dozen bomb threats — mostly from foreign actors seeking to sow discord —
have prompted the state to send in additional state troopers and install
surveillance cameras around the city in order to reopen schools and
government buildings.</p>
<p>“We’ve got good people here. Republican, Democrat. They’re good
people,” Mobley said Tuesday, as the pantry tended to a steady stream of
clients seeking clothing and food.</p>
<p>Resident Josh Valle said the situation is unsettling.</p>
<p>“We definitely need answers,” said the 35-year-old tool and die
repairman, who has lived in Springfield for decades. “It’s affecting my
kids and my community and my neighbors. With the bomb threats and the
influx, it’s something new every day. And this used to be a really chill
town, you know, it used to be just a small town Ohio.”</p>
<p>The area around Springfield City Hall, where Valle spoke, sat largely
silent Tuesday afternoon, until a news conference with state and local
officials prompted a brief swarm of activity. Local families are
avoiding schools in the wake of earlier bomb threats, even though dozens
of troopers have fanned out across the Springfield City School District
to stand guard. Some 200 of 500 students were absent Tuesday from a
single elementary school, officials said.</p>
<p>Still, there are signs of hope.</p>
<p>“Home Sweet Springfield” tea towels adorn the window of Champion City
Guide &amp; Supply on a downtown block that bustles with activity over
the lunch hour. One line of mugs and clothing items reads: “Speak a Good
Word for Springfield — or say nothing.”</p>
<p>Across town, a small group of kids whose parents kept them home on
Tuesday horsed around together at a makeshift lemonade stand they set up
to make a few bucks. They delighted in the revving motor of a passing
muscle car and, when sales were slow, swigged back the merchandise.</p>
<p>David Graham, who visits communities in crisis as The Praying Cowboy,
positioned himself in Springfield this week to show support. “Agenda:
Pray, worship, witness, smile, honor, esteem,” he wrote in a Facebook
post from the city, accompanied by his hands holding an open Bible with
a newly installed surveillance platform in the background. He added
lines with black electrical tape to a small heart placard he posted
nearby, to represent Springfield hearts being broken.</p>
<p>He wasn’t the only one trying to help. A bipartisan group of area
mayors met with Springfield Mayor Rob Rue on Monday to figure out how
they can help — including with resources to address the traffic, health
care, social services and housing needs prompted by the increase in the
Haitian population and their language barrier.</p>
<p>Andrew Ginther, the Democratic mayor of Ohio’s capital, Columbus, and
president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, said in a statement: “Mayors
across America will continue to stand by Springfield and all cities
working to responsibly address an increased number of migrants, which we
can do without losing sight of our shared humanity.”</p>
<p>Years ago, Family Needs Inc. was designated one of President George
H.W. Bush’s “thousand points of light,” honoring its dedication to
volunteerism. The organization has helped Haitians arriving in
Springfield for years now, Mobley said — providing them translation
services and co-signing their rental agreements.</p>
<p>He recalled working with Haitian immigrants as far back as 2016, the
year Trump was elected — though census figures show the population
remained at only about 400 until a few years ago.</p>
<p>“In 2016, we started signing contracts. Through the pandemic, we were
doing things for the Haitian community,” he said. “Has that all been
forgotten? They have been here, and we’ve been dealing with this, and
we’ve been asking for help through two different administrations. And no
administration has helped us, until now this thing has become
public.”</p>
<p>As she walked downtown, one resident who declined to give her name
said she’s not letting the situation get her down.</p>
<p>“It’s childish. It’s stupid. It took one stupid person to get on a
debate and ruin the reputation of a community. I think you know exactly
who I’m talking about,” she said.</p>
<p>“He should never have said that. There’s no truth to those
allegations whatsoever. I was born and raised in this town, I’m staying
here, and I have no problem with nobody.”</p>

three US men ended up facing death penalty over Congo coup attempt</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>KINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo — A military court in
Democratic Republic of Congo, one of Africa’s largest countries, has
convicted three Americans and dozens of others of taking part in a coup
attempt and imposed “the harshest penalty, that of death.”</p>
<p>The court convicted the 37 defendants, including the three Americans
and imposed the death penalty in a verdict delivered by presiding judge
Maj. Freddy Ehuma at an open-air military court proceeding.</p>
<p>The defendants, a majority of them Congolese but also including a
Briton, a Belgian and a Canadian, were charged with terrorism, murder,
criminal association and illegal possession of weapons, among other
charges.</p>
<p>The lawyer who defended the six foreigners said they would appeal the
verdicts.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department strongly discourages travel to Congo,
warning of violent crime and civil unrest. Here’s how the three
Americans ended up in the middle of the coup attempt.</p>
<p>What happened during the coup attempt in May?</p>
<p>In Congo’s capital Kinshasa, a ragtag group including three Americans
tried to unseat the country’s President Felix Tshisekedi. They were led
by a little-known opposition figure, Christian Malanga, who sold used
cars and dabbled in gold mining before persuading his Utah-born son to
join in the foiled coup.</p>
<p>The coup attempt began at the Kinshasa residence of Tshisekedi’s
close ally, Vital Kamerhe, a federal legislator and a candidate for
Speaker of the National Assembly of Congo. His guards killed some of the
attackers, officials said.</p>
<p>Christian Malanga, meanwhile, was live-streaming video from the
presidential palace in which he is seen surrounded by several armed men
in military uniforms wandering around in the middle of the night. He was
later killed while resisting arrest, Congolese authorities said.</p>
<p>Dozens, including Malanga’s son and two other Americans, were
arrested and brought to a high-security military prison in Kinshasa.
Family members said the young men have been sleeping on the floor,
struggling with health issues and have had to pay for food and hygiene
products.</p>
<p>Christian Malanga, the unlikely coup leader</p>
<p>Malanga, who was born in Kinshasa, had described himself as a refugee
who thrived after settling in the U.S. with his family in the 1990s. He
said he became a leader of a Congolese opposition political party and
met high-level officials in Washington and the Vatican. He also
described himself as a devoted husband and father of eight.</p>
<p>Court records and interviews paint another picture. In 2001, the year
he turned 18, Malanga was convicted in Utah of assault with a firearm,
which resulted in a 30-day jail sentence and three years of probation.
That same year, he was charged with domestic violence assault in one
incident and battery and disturbing the peace in another, but he pleaded
not guilty and all counts in both cases were dismissed.</p>
<p>In 2004, he was charged with domestic violence with threat of using a
dangerous weapon, but he pleaded not guilty and the charges were again
dismissed. Since 2004, records show several cases related to a custody
dispute and a child support dispute.</p>
<p>How three young Americans got involved in a coup attempt</p>
<p>The three imprisoned Americans are Malanga’s 21-year-old son Marcel
Malanga, Tyler Thompson Jr., 21, who flew to Africa from Utah with the
younger Malanga for what his family believed was a free vacation, and
Benjamin Reuben Zalman-Polun, 36, who is reported to have known
Christian Malanga through a gold mining company.</p>
<p>Marcel Malanga is a U.S. citizen and was born in Utah. He told the
court his father had threatened to kill him and Thompson if they did not
take part in the attack.</p>
<p>His mother, Brittney Sawyer, has said her son is innocent and was
simply following his father, who considered himself president of a
shadow government in exile.</p>
<p>Thompson was his high school friend and football teammate in the Salt
Lake City suburb of West Jordan. He was the only former teammate to
accept Marcel Malanga’s invitation to travel to Congo, according to
several other players who told The Associated Press they had been
invited to what the younger Malanga pitched interchangeably as a family
vacation or as a service trip to build wells. Other teammates alleged
that Marcel Malanga had offered up to $100,000 to join him on a
“security job” in Congo.</p>
<p>Thompson’s family maintains he had no knowledge of the elder
Malanga’s intentions, no plans for political activism and didn’t even
plan to enter Congo. He and the Malangas were meant to travel only to
South Africa and Eswatini, his stepmother, Miranda Thompson, said.</p>
<p>Here’s what happens next</p>
<p>All of those convicted have five days to appeal the verdict. Richard
Bondo, the lawyer who defended the Americans and three other foreigners,
said he plans to do so.</p>
<p>Congo reinstated the death penalty earlier this year, lifting a more
than two-decade-old moratorium, as authorities struggle to curb violence
and militant attacks in the country. The men convicted in the coup
attempt would likely be executed by firing squad.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department has not declared the Americans wrongfully
detained, making it unlikely that U.S. officials would try to negotiate
their return.</p>

<h2 id="biden-opens-home-to-quad-leaders-for-farewell-summit">Biden
opens home to Quad leaders for farewell summit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Wilmington, Delaware — President Joe Biden hosted Australia’s prime
minister at his Delaware home Friday at the start of a weekend summit
with the “Quad” group he has pushed as a counterweight to China. </p>
<p>Biden chose Wilmington for a summit of leaders from Australia, India
and Japan — the last of his presidency after he dropped out of the 2024
election against Donald Trump and handed the Democratic campaign reins
to Vice President Kamala Harris. </p>
<p>After a one-on-one meeting at his property with Australia’s Anthony
Albanese on Friday night, he will welcome Indian Prime Minister Narendra
Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at his home on
Saturday. </p>
<p>Biden will then host an “intimate” dinner and full four-way summit
that day at his former high school in the city. </p>
<p>“This will be President Biden’s first time hosting foreign leaders in
Wilmington as president — a reflection of his deep personal
relationships with each of the Quad leaders,” said press secretary
Karine Jean-Pierre.  </p>
<p>Harris will not be attending, the White House said. </p>
<p>The Quad grouping dates to 2007, but Biden has strongly pushed it as
part of an emphasis on international alliances after the isolationist
Trump years. </p>
<p>China was expected to feature heavily in their discussions amid
tensions with Beijing, particularly a series of recent confrontations
between Chinese and Philippine vessels in the disputed South China
Sea. </p>
<p>“It will certainly be high on the agenda,” National Security Council
spokesperson John Kirby said, adding that the four leaders had a “common
understanding about the challenges that the PRC [People’s Republic of
China] is posing.” </p>
<p>The White House, however, faced criticism for giving only limited
access to the press throughout the weekend, with reporters questioning
whether it was at the request of the media-shy Modi. </p>
<p>The prime minister was coaxed to take two questions during a state
visit to the White House in 2023 but had not held an open press
conference at home in his previous nine years in power. </p>
<p>The White House insisted Biden would not shy away from addressing
rights issues with Modi, who has faced accusations of growing
authoritarianism. </p>
<p>“There’s not a conversation that he has with foreign leaders where he
doesn’t talk about the importance of respecting human and civil rights,
and that includes with Prime Minister Modi,” Kirby said. </p>
<p>India is to host the next Quad summit in 2025. </p>
<p>Biden is famously proud of his home in Wilmington, about 176
kilometers from Washington, and he frequently spends weekends there away
from the White House.</p>

soldier who entered North Korea pleads guilty to desertion</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A U.S. soldier who crossed into North Korea last year
pleaded guilty to desertion on Friday as part of a plea agreement and
was sentenced to 12 months of confinement, his lawyer said.</p>
<p>Because of good behavior and time served, the soldier was released,
according to the lawyer.</p>
<p>Travis King was facing 14 charges related to him fleeing across the
border from South Korea into the North in July 2023 while on a
sightseeing tour of the Demilitarized Zone that divides the Korean
Peninsula, and for prior incidents.</p>
<p>But he pleaded guilty to just five — desertion, assault on a
noncommissioned officer, and three counts of disobeying an officer — as
part of a deal that was accepted on Friday by a military judge.</p>
<p>“The judge, under the terms of the plea deal, sentenced Travis to one
year of confinement, reduction in rank to private (E-1), forfeiture of
all pay and allowances, and a dishonorable discharge,” a statement from
King’s attorney Franklin Rosenblatt said.</p>
<p>“With time already served and credit for good behavior, Travis is now
free and will return home,” the statement said.</p>
<p>“Travis King has faced significant challenges throughout his life,
including a difficult upbringing, exposure to criminal environments, and
struggles with mental health,” Rosenblatt said. “All these factors have
compounded the hardships he faced in the military.”</p>
<p>In a statement, the U.S. Army’s Office of Special Trial Counsel
confirmed King’s guilty plea as part of a deal and said that “pursuant
to the terms of the plea agreement, all other charges and specifications
were dismissed.”</p>
<p>“The outcome of today’s court martial is a fair and just result that
reflects the seriousness of the offenses committed by Pvt. King,”
prosecutor Major Allyson Montgomery said in the statement.</p>
<p>At the time of the incident, King had been stationed in South Korea,
and after a drunken bar fight and a stay in South Korean jail, he was
supposed to fly back to Texas to face disciplinary hearings.</p>
<p>Instead, he walked out of the Seoul-area airport, joined a DMZ
sightseeing trip and slipped over the fortified border where he was
detained by the communist North’s authorities.</p>
<p>Pyongyang had said that King had defected to North Korea to escape
“mistreatment and racial discrimination in the U.S. Army.”</p>
<p>But after completing its investigation, North Korea “decided to
expel” King in September for illegally intruding into its territory.</p>
