<blockquote cite="https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/12/publishers-find-the-ai-era-not-all-that-lucrative/">
<p>
According to public financial documents from its parent company IAC and
first reported
<a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/openai-dotdash-meredith-licensing-payment/">by
Adweek</a> OpenAI is paying around $16 million per year to license
content [from Dotdash Meredith].
</p>
<p>
That is no doubt welcome incremental revenue, and you could call it
“lucrative” in the sense of having a fat margin, as OpenAI is almost
certainly paying for content that was already being produced. But to put
things into perspective, Dotdash Meredith is on course to generate over
$1.5 billion in revenues in 2024, more than a third of it from print. So
the OpenAI deal is equal to about 1% of the publisher’s total revenue.

<h2 id="weeknotes-starting-2025-a-little-slow">Weeknotes: Starting 2025
a little slow</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-04, updated: 2025-01-04, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
I published my
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/31/llms-in-2024/">review of
2024 in LLMs</a> and then got into a fight with most of the internet
over the
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/2/they-spy-on-you-but-not-like-that/">phone
microphone targeted ads conspiracy theory</a>.
</p>
<p>
In my last weeknotes I talked about how
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/20/december-in-llms-has-been-a-lot/">December
in LLMs has been a lot</a>. That was on December 20th, and it turned out
there were at least three big new LLM stories still to come before the
end of the year:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
OpenAI announced initial benchmarks for their o3 reasoning model, which
I covered
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/20/live-blog-the-12th-day-of-openai/">in
a live blog</a> for the last day of their mixed-quality 12 days of
OpenAI series. o3 is
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/20/openai-o3-breakthrough/">genuinely
impressive</a>.
</li>
<li>
Alibaba’s Qwen released their
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/24/qvq/">QvQ visual
reasoning model</a>, which I ran locally
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/24/qvq/#with-mlx-vlm">using
mlx-vlm</a>. It’s the o1/o3 style trick applied to image prompting and
it runs on my laptop.
</li>
<li>
DeepSeek - the other big open license Chinese AI lab - shocked everyone
by
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/31/llms-in-2024/#was-the-best-currently-available-llm-trained-in-china-for-less-than-6m-">releasing
DeepSeek v3 on Christmas day</a>, an open model that compares favorably
to the very best closed model and was trained for just $5.6m, 11x less
that Meta’s best Llama 3 model, Llama 3.1 405B.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For the second year running I published my
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/series/llms-annual-review/">review of
LLM developments over the past year</a> on December 31st. I’d estimate
this took at least four hours of computer time to write and another two
of miscellaneous note taking over the past few weeks, but that’s likely
an under-estimate.
</p>
<p>
It went over really well. I’ve had a ton of great feedback about it,
both from people who wanted to catch up and from people who have been
following the space closely. I even
<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/02/willison-llms-2024">got
fireballed</a>!
</p>
<p>
I’ve had a slower start to 2025 than I had intended. A challenge with
writing online is that, like code, writing requires maintenance: any
time I drop a popular article I feel obliged to track and participate in
any resulting conversations.
</p>
<p>
Then just as the chatter about my 2024 review started to fade, the Apple
Siri microphone settlement story broke and I couldn’t resist publishing
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/2/they-spy-on-you-but-not-like-that/">I
still don’t think companies serve you ads based on spying through your
microphone</a>.
</p>
<p>
Trying to talk people out of believing that conspiracy theory is my
toxic trait. I know there’s no point even trying, but I can’t drag
myself away.
</p>
<p>
I think my New Year’s resolution should probably be to spend less time
arguing with people on the internet!
</p>
<p>
Anyway: January is here, and I’m determined to use it to make progress
on both Datasette 1.0 and the paid launch of Datasette Cloud.

call the LLM “the Shoggoth”.

When you have a conversation with Claude, what’s really happening is
you’re coauthoring a fictional conversation transcript with the Shoggoth
wherein you are writing the lines of one of the characters (the User),

But Claude is fake. The Shoggoth is real. And the Shoggoth’s

</p>
Bit of a surprising press release here from 14th November 2024: Virgin
Media O2 (the UK companies
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Media_O2">merged in
2021</a>) announced their entrance into the

game:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Daisy combines various AI models which work together to listen and
respond to fraudulent calls instantaneously and is so lifelike it has
successfully kept numerous fraudsters on calls for 40 minutes at a time.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hard to tell from the press release how much this is a sincere ongoing
project as opposed to a short-term marketing gimmick.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
After several weeks of taking calls in the run up to International Fraud
Awareness Week (November 17-23), the AI Scambaiter has told frustrated
scammers meandering stories of her family, talked at length about her
passion for knitting and provided exasperated callers with false
personal information including made-up bank details.

<strong><a href="https://zohaib.me/using-llms-and-cursor-for-finishing-projects-productivity/">Using
LLMs and Cursor to become a finisher</a></strong>
</p>
Zohaib Rauf describes a pattern I’ve seen quite a few examples of now:
engineers who moved into management but now find themselves able to ship
working code again (at least for their side projects) thanks to the
productivity boost they get from leaning on LLMs.
</p>
<p>
<p>Zohaib also provides a very useful detailed example of how they use a
combination of ChatGPT and Cursor to work on projects, by starting with
a spec created through collaboration with o1, then saving that as a
<code>SPEC.md</code> Markdown file and adding that to Cursor’s context

<h2 id="what-we-learned-copying-all-the-best-code-assistants">What we
learned copying all the best code assistants</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-04, updated: 2025-01-04, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://blog.val.town/blog/fast-follow/">What we
learned copying all the best code assistants</a></strong>
</p>
Steve Krouse describes Val Town’s experience so far building features
that use LLMs, starting with completions (powered by
<a href="https://codeium.com/">Codeium</a> and Val Town’s own
<a href="https://github.com/val-town/codemirror-codeium">codemirror-codeium</a>
extension) and then rolling through several versions of their
<a href="https://www.val.town/townie">Townie</a> code assistant,
initially powered by GPT 3.5 but later upgraded to Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
</p>
<p>
This is a really interesting space to explore right now because there is
so much activity in it from larger players. Steve classifies Val Town’s
approach as “fast following” - trying to spot the patterns that are
proven to work and bring them into their own product.
</p>
<p>
It’s challenging from a strategic point of view because Val Town’s core
differentiator isn’t meant to be AI coding assistance: they’re trying to
build the best possible ecosystem for hosting and iterating lightweight
server-side JavaScript applications. Isn’t this stuff all a distraction
from that larger goal?
</p>
<p>
Steve concludes:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
However, it still feels like there’s a lot to be gained with a
fully-integrated web AI code editor experience in Val Town – even if we
can only get 80% of the features that the big dogs have, and a couple
months later. It doesn’t take that much work to copy the best features
we see in other tools. The benefits to a fully integrated experience
seems well worth that cost. In short, we’ve had a lot of success
fast-following so far, and think it’s worth continuing to do so.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>It continues to be wild to me how features like this are easy enough
to build now that they can be part-time side features at a small
startup, and not the entire project.</p>

<p>
I know these are real risks, and to be clear, when I say an AI “thinks,”
“learns,” “understands,” “decides,” or “feels,” I’m speaking
metaphorically. Current AI systems don’t have a consciousness, emotions,
a sense of self, or physical sensations. So why take the risk? Because
as imperfect as the analogy is, working with AI is easiest if you think
of it like an alien person rather than a human-built machine. And I
think that is important to get across, even with the risks of
anthropomorphism.
