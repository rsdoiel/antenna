## We Will Do It Together

date: 2024-12-22, from: Our Future.org

In the coming year, we'll have to make unprecedented choices, as a nation and in every community, about who we want to be. It’s been quite a year. From the election to weather extremes and the pent-up outrage we saw after the violent murder of a corporate CEO, we’ve faced unprecedented challenges. We know even [&#8230;]

## W. Heath Robinson

date: 2024-12-22, from: Status-Q blog

We have some Heath Robinson cartoons which we still very much enjoy, but for which no longer have the wall space, and so have given them away. I thought, though, that other Status-Q readers might enjoy them too. (Click for larger versions.)

## Clay UI library

date: 2024-12-21, updated: 2024-12-21, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.nicbarker.com/clay">Clay UI library</a></strong></p>
Fascinating project by Nic Barker, who describes Clay like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clay is a flex-box style UI auto layout library in C, with declarative syntax and microsecond performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYWTw19_8r4">intro video</a> to the library is outstanding: I learned a ton about how UI layout works from this, and the animated visual explanations are clear, tasteful and really helped land the different concepts:</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="DYWTw19_8r4"
  title="Introducing Clay - High Performance UI Layout in C"
  playlabel="Play: Introducing Clay - High Performance UI Layout in C"
> </lite-youtube></p>

<p>Clay is a C library delivered in a single ~2000 line <a href="https://github.com/nicbarker/clay/blob/main/clay.h">clay.h</a> dependency-free header file. It only handles layout calculations: if you want to render the result you need to add an additional rendering layer.</p>
<p>In a fascinating demo of the library, the <a href="https://www.nicbarker.com/clay">Clay site itself</a> is rendered using Clay C compiled to WebAssembly! You can even switch between the default HTML renderer and an alternative based on Canvas.</p>
<p>This isn't necessarily a great idea: because the layout is entirely handled using <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements positioned using <code>transform: translate(0px, 70px)</code> style CSS attempting to select text across multiple boxes behaves strangely, and it's not clear to me what the accessibility implications are.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="https://toot.cafe/@matt/113693374074675126">Matt Campbell</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The accessibility implications are as serious as you might guess. The links aren't properly labeled, there's no semantic markup such as headings, and since there's a div for every line, continuous reading with a screen reader is choppy, that is, it pauses at the end of every physical line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It does make for a very compelling demo of what Clay is capable of though, especially when you resize your browser window and the page layout is recalculated in real-time via the Clay WebAssembly bridge.</p>
<p>You can hit "D" on the website and open up a custom Clay debugger showing the hierarchy of layout elements on the page:</p>
<p><img alt="Clay website on the left, on the right is a panel showing a tree of UI layout elements, one has been selected and is showing details in a box at the bottom of the panel: Bounding Box: { x: 278, y: 13, width: 101, height: 24}, Layout Direction: LEFT_TO_RIGHT, Sizing: width: FITQ, height: FITQ, Padding: {x:8,uy:0}" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/clay-debug.jpg" /></p>
<p>This also means that the entire page is defined using C code! Given that, I find the code itself <a href="https://github.com/nicbarker/clay/blob/35d72e5fba6872be48d15ed9d84269a86cd72b4e/examples/clay-official-website/main.c#L124-L139">surprisingly readable</a></p>

<p>I'm not ready to ditch HTML and CSS for writing my web pages in C compiled to WebAssembly just yet, but as an exercise in understanding layout engines (and a potential tool for building non-web interfaces in the future) this is a really interesting project to dig into.</p>
<p>To clarify here: I don't think the web layout / WebAssembly thing is the key idea behind Clay at all - I think it's a neat demo of the library, but it's not what Clay is <em>for</em>. It's certainly an interesting way to provide a demo of a layout library!</p>
<p>Nic <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nicbarker.com/post/3ldu44rxyx22h">confirms</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You totally nailed it, the fact that you can compile to wasm and run in HTML stemmed entirely from a “wouldn’t it be cool if…” It was designed for my C projects first and foremost!</p>

RSS and WordPress form a powerful distribution system. Lots of software works with those two protocols, as do many programmers, and they&#39;re both marvelously open, stable over more than twenty years each, and can&#39;t be owned by billionaires.

## Christmas Classics

The oral tradition has long been an important part of preserving human culture, and it is perhaps especially at this time of year that we&#8217;re conscious of works of music and literature that have been handed down through the ages. While I was showering this morning, for example, I found myself singing a cheerful seasonal <a class="more-link excerpt-link" href="https://statusq.org/archives/2024/12/21/12311/">Continue Reading<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span></a>
