## Wine 10 released: Open source Windows compatibility app brings better support for high-res displays, ARM64EC support, and more

date: 2025-01-21, from: Liliputing

First released in 1993, Wine has been around almost as long as Linux, and it&#8217;s been used as the foundation of Valve&#8217;s Proton software (which lets you [&#8230;]</p>

## Why Are People Leaving This City We’ve Made Impossible to Live In?

date: 2025-01-21, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p>As city leaders, we’re stunned we’re losing thousands and thousands of residents who say they can’t build a life here. We don’t understand why they’re leaving, even after we’ve spent all our time in office making this city absolutely inhospitable to working people.</p> <p>The building block of a comfortable life is housing, so we’re surprised to hear people struggle to find affordable homes. Maybe they’re not considering all of their options. Perhaps they could move to a cheaper, outer borough like the Bronx or Queens, or an outer-outer borough like Long Island, or an outer-space borough like our new colony on Jupiter’s moon Ganymede (six months&#8217; rent required at signing).</p> <p>Don’t limit yourself to movement on our three-dimensional plane. How about time-traveling back to 1987 to buy a dilapidated brownstone and then waiting forty years to cash out at the expense of the suckers who made the bad decision to be born after you? After all, that’s what every elected official did.</p> <p>The families that can afford to stay here still whine, especially about our transit system. We thought parents loved it; they can spend all day hauling double strollers down rain-flooded stairs to the open kiln we call a subway station in August. It’s hours of free, heatstroke-inducing fun for the whole family, unless anyone in that family needs an elevator. In that case, may I refer you to our new outpost on Jupiter’s moon Ganymede? There are no elevators there either, but in space, no one can hear you complain.</p> <p>Also, we don’t know how people flee this city so quickly; they’re certainly not doing it on our crumbling public transit.</p> <p>Even the people who ride bicycles have problems. I don’t understand why they can’t find secure bike parking. All of our city employees manage to park their two-ton SUVs on sidewalks and in bike lanes. Surely, you can squeeze your little pedal-toy thing between them.</p> <p>Don’t even get us started on the walkers. Constant boohooing about reckless drivers blowing through crosswalks. Is it a bad thing we offer impromptu mobile parkour options for our residents? In other cities, you’d pay top dollars to try and barrel-roll over a Chevy Tahoe, but here, you can do it for free whenever you need a gallon of milk.</p> <p>Everyone who leaves should think of the opportunities they’re denying their children, whom they can’t afford to raise in our incredibly expensive city. We’re home to the best education in the world, teaching millions of kids it’s not about where you’re born or who your parents are but who your parents know on an admissions committee (mine knew the guy whose great-great-grandfather invented hats).</p> <p>And they’re leaving even though we announced free preschool for all kids. We didn’t follow through in any way, but it was a heck of an announcement. Balloons, streamers, an <span class="caps">FBI</span> raid in the middle of the press conference: It had it all (except an actual plan).</p> <p>Like we said, it’s expensive to live in this city. You may have to get financially creative and cut back on some essentials, like Netflix subscriptions or paying any of your taxes. It works great for our rich friends; they have plenty of cash left over to donate to our campaigns.</p> <p>These fleeing families talk a lot about “quality of life,” but not enough people talk about shutting up and white-knuckling your way through an arbitrarily more difficult existence in this playground for the uber wealthy we’ve created. Could things be better? Shut up. Wait, where are you going, and what exactly is a “Philadelphia”?</p> <p>Progress is often slow and difficult to come by, especially when we’re working so hard to stall it. The only thing left to do is keep moving forward in our official government <span class="caps">SUV</span>, past the noise, past this pedestrian-filled crosswalk, and past whatever is under our front bumper, pleading, “Help me.”</p>

## I Am a Disappointed Trump Voter Who Was Told It Would Be the Past by Now

date: 2025-01-21, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p>Well, they say you should never trust a politician, and it seems I’ve been duped.</p> <p>For months before and since I cast my vote for Donald J. Trump—and yes, I’m one of those people who really leans into the “J” for some reason—I have been promised by every reliable source that change was finally coming to America, after four years of the failed leadership of Joe Biden and then the four years before that, which I can’t remember.</p> <p>But it’s abundantly clear that the Trump presidency is delivering more of the same. And it’s the bad kind of same that’s been happening lately, not the good kind of same like from the good old days. When men could be men, women could be women, and I didn’t have to go to work or pay for anything because I was a child.</p> <p>On issue after issue, we are being force-fed “now” when we were promised “then.”</p> <p>Take rising prices. On January 20, at noon sharp, I busted down the door of my local grocery store like it was Black Friday—and after management told me that the door would’ve opened automatically if I had waited two more seconds, I was shocked by what I saw.</p> <p>A dozen eggs still cost four dollars. So did a gallon of milk. And my fifth-grade teacher, who I used to run into all the time there? Still dead.</p> <p>Something was wrong. I thought maybe these grocery workers were some sort of uncontacted people who were living under the tragic illusion that Joe Biden was still president. But no. They’re modern people. They keep up with the news through Facebook, just like you and me. And yet, they were acting as if there was no difference between the day Biden left office and the day Trump took office.</p> <p>Then there’s the male loneliness epidemic. The voices who talk to me in my head—mostly Barstool hosts via my earbuds—convinced me that maybe this terrible feeling of isolation they told me I was experiencing might finally be a thing of the past. But even though I voted for the guy who has spent decades betraying absolutely every single person in his life as soon as they no longer suit his immediate needs, I still have no friends.</p> <p>I was also promised that my vote would bring an end to <span class="caps">DEI</span>, ERGs, <span class="caps">CSR</span>, and <span class="caps">LGBTQ</span>, leaving only real American letters like <span class="caps">UFC</span> and <span class="caps">EIEIO</span>. And yet, when I showed up to work this morning, not a single one of my female co-workers had vanished in a puff of smoke. And also, they still won’t let me smoke at work! What decade is this—not the 1950s?</p> <p>Then I got home, turned on the TV, and found that the Washington Commanders are still called the Washington Commanders? And they’re doing crazy hot right now? And the couples in the commercials for my favorite erectile dysfunction pills are still interracial? And they’re crazy hot right now?</p> <p>To let off some steam, I went to the globe store to see if I could get my model globe replaced—now that the United States is acquiring Greenland, Canada, Mexico, and Panama, and I imagine the UN would probably throw in some random bonus ones, like Suriname. But the disgruntled employee at the front desk insisted mine was up to date and that none of those places are states yet—presumably because she’s one of those deep-state operatives that the administration still hasn’t gotten around to axing.</p> <p>Now, to be fair, Donald Trump has kept some promises. He brought back TikTok. And he did it so effectively that it happened on the last guy’s watch.</p> <p>But everything else about his presidency thus far implies that Donald Trump is the same guy he was eight years ago, doomed to disappoint as compared to the extravagantly transformative promises he has made. That even he is subject to political gravity and the constraints, however loosened, of the Constitution.</p> <p>And if that’s the case, let me draw a clear line in the sand: I will not be voting for him in 2028.</p>

## What Makes a Good Team?

No team is perfect, but I think it’s often kind of obvious when a team is bad &#8211; there’s usually a level of chaos or drama, a sense that they can’t be relied on or don’t really deliver the value that the organization needs. I think it’s also quite obvious when a team is good, [&#8230;]

## Beyond “Prompt and Pray”

date: 2025-01-21, from: O'Reilly Radar

TL;DR: Enterprise AI teams are discovering that purely agentic approaches (dynamically chaining LLM calls) don’t deliver the reliability needed for production systems. The prompt-and-pray model—where business logic lives entirely in prompts—creates systems that are unreliable, inefficient, and impossible to maintain at scale. A shift toward structured automation, which separates conversational ability from business logic execution, [&#8230;]

## Welcome Home, President Nyarlathotep

date: 2025-01-21, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p>Please allow me to take your umbrella, <a href="https://www.mcsweeneys.net/columns/the-dread-lord-nyarlathotep-presidential-library">Dread Lord</a>. My advisors informed me this morning during my final daily presidential briefing that Hell had frozen over in honor of your return. They certainly made their decision frigidly clear, by golly. I’m happy the Capitol One Arena could accommodate the final details of your resummoning ritual on such short notice. The intestinal pedestal erected so the guests of honor from TikTok, Meta, Amazon, and SpaceX can properly show fealty by licking your pustuled tentacle was a particularly nice touch.</p> <p>I know we do not see eye-to-eye sockets on most things. As President these past four years, I repeatedly <a href="https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/well-we-gave-nyarlathotep-a-chance-and-he-gave-us-four-years-of-horror-but-its-time-to-move-on-as-a-nation">tried to remind the nation</a> about the unequivocal evidence that you are not a “rational human being” in any traditional sense of the term but rather an Outer God of Chaos devoid of any semblance of conscience, humility, or even sentient logic. You, meanwhile, cursed my family with bile plagues, plotted retribution from your Shadow Palace at Mar-a-Lago, and raged incoherently from some surreal psychic plane known in the common tongue as Truth Social. You also somehow managed to eternally infect millions of American minds with false visions of nightmarish and imaginary foes, bird-murdering windmills, and cheap eggs.</p> <p>But never mind that you’re a convicted necromancer with a paper trail linking you to every conceivable atrocity, crime against natural law, and humiliating deviance. The country made its voice loud and clear last November—and by “loud and clear,” I mean less than 23 percent of the nation’s total population.</p> <p>So it goes. The gears of this Great Nation grind on, no matter who or how many people beg us to stop and reconsider. My only responsibility today is to pass the torch that will help illuminate a new era that’s somehow more hauntingly grotesque, bleak, and horrifying than your first.</p> <p>Some say I, in my tenure as Commander-in-Chief, could have helped silence the trumpets that began heralding your apocalyptic return from nearly the moment I assumed the presidency. Critics in my own party say I should have encased the Necronomicon in tetanus-riddled barbed wire and used one of Elon’s rockets to jettison it into the sun. Or, perhaps, I should have properly outfitted the country’s already problematically powerful Witchfinder Generals to root out your mindless goblin horde that stormed the Capitol in a last-ditch effort to appease you. I was even informed there is some pretty clear language in the Constitution’s tattered remnants that explicitly lay out a simple legal spell to banish you back to the Salted Plains of Mar-a-Lago for the rest of your unnatural life.</p> <p>To which I say: Look, it really was more a top-to-bottom failure of every conceivable institutional safeguard that brought us here. Maybe even a fatal flaw in capitalism’s occultic fabric that inevitably metastasizes humanity’s worse inclinations. I’m just spitballing, but maybe American worship of wealth exacerbates these baser tendencies toward a societal breaking point. And, once broken, that rending in reality charts a direct path for a Stalker Among the Stars such as yourself into the Oval Office</p> <p>I’m just saying, they can’t really lay it all at my feet, alright? I’m sure you and I can at least agree on that. Well, that and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/biden-pardons-family.html">pardoning</a> our respective progeny.</p> <p>But at the end of the day, I suppose I don’t care what the political historians, marginalized constituents, fearful targets of your ire, experts in the arcane, or my own tired eyes tried to tell me. For reasons I have never been able to articulate convincingly, I believe the American Democratic Experiment is greater than any one vindictive and insatiable Elder God.</p> <p>I know you campaigned on a renewed platform of “I See All, And It Shall Burn.” I know innumerable cretins, nihilists, billionaires, and crypto bros are at the gates, salivating at the Body Politic’s final, shuddering gasps. But it’s either this or permitting Americans to realize the truth: Humanity is still capable of conjuring its own protective communities—and that scares the shit out of feckless politicians, soul-shirking opportunists, and maybe even Outer Gods.</p> <p>But if my hunch is correct—and hey, there’s a first time for everything—we should be good to go. So, before I escort you into the Inauguration Day Fealty Orgy, let me be the first to say: Welcome home, Dread Lord Nyarlathotep.</p>

## DeepSeek-R1 and exploring DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B

date: 2025-01-20, updated: 2025-01-20, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p>DeepSeek are the Chinese AI lab who dropped the best currently available open weights LLM <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/26/deepseek-v3/">on Christmas day</a>, DeepSeek v3. That model was trained in part using their unreleased R1 "reasoning" model. Today <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1">they've released R1 itself</a>, along with a whole family of new models derived from that base.</p>
<p>There's a whole lot of stuff in the new release.</p>
<p><strong>DeepSeek-R1-Zero</strong> appears to be the base model. It's <a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Zero/tree/main">over 650GB</a> in size and, like most of their other releases, is <a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Zero/blob/main/LICENSE">under a clean MIT license</a>. DeepSeek warn that "DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing." ... so they also released:</p>
<p><strong>DeepSeek-R1</strong> - which "incorporates cold-start data before RL" and "achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks". That one is also MIT licensed, and is a similar size.</p>
<p>I don't have the ability to run models larger than about 50GB (I have an M2 with 64GB of RAM), so neither of these two models are something I can easily play with myself. That's where the new <strong>distilled models</strong> come in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a fascinating flex! They have models based on Qwen 2.5 (14B, 32B, Math 1.5B and Math 7B) and Llama 3 (Llama-3.1 8B and Llama 3.3 70B Instruct).</p>
<p>Weirdly those Llama models have an MIT license attached, which I'm not sure is compatible with the underlying Llama license. Qwen models are Apache licensed so maybe MIT is OK?</p>
<p>(I also <a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B/commit/c79f47acaf303faabb7133b4b7b76f24231f2c8d#d2h-740129">just noticed</a> the MIT license files say "Copyright (c) 2023 DeepSeek" so they may need to pay a little bit more attention to how they copied those in.)</p>
<p>Licensing aside, these distilled models are fascinating beasts.</p>
<h4 id="running-deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b-gguf">Running DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-GGUF</h4>
<p>Quantized versions are already starting to show up. So far I've tried just one of those -  <code>unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-GGUF</code> released by <a href="https://unsloth.ai/">Unsloth AI</a> - and it's really fun to play with.</p>
<p>I'm running it using the combination of <a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a>, <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/taketwo/llm-ollama">llm-ollama plugin</a>.</p>
<p>First I fetched and ran the model using Ollama itself:</p>
<pre><code>ollama run hf.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-GGUF:Q8_0
</code></pre>
<p>This downloads around 8.5GB of model data and starts an interactive chat interface.</p>
<p>Once the model has been fetched, LLM can talk to it as well. I prefer using LLM for experiments because it <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/logging.html">logs everything to SQLite</a> for later exploration.</p>
<p>I installed the plugin and ran it like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-ollama
llm -m 'hf.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-GGUF:Q8_0' \
  'a joke about a pelican and a walrus who run a tea room together'
</code></pre>
<p>Each response starts with a <code>&lt;think&gt;...&lt;/think&gt;</code> pseudo-XML tag containing the chain of thought used to help generate the response. For "a joke about a pelican and a walrus who run a tea room together" that started like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>&lt;think&gt;</code><br />
Okay, so I need to come up with a joke about a pelican and a walrus running a tea room together. Hmm, that's an interesting combination. Let me think about how these two characters might interact in a humorous situation.</p>
<p>First, let's consider their characteristics. Pelicans are known for their long beaks and Webbed feet, often seen near the beach or water. Walruses have big teeth, thick fur, and they're generally found in colder climates, like icebergs or snowy areas. So, combining these two into a tea room setting is already a funny image.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It then thought for <em>20 paragraphs</em> before outputting the joke! Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/f505ce733a435c8fc8fdf3448e3816b0">the full transcript</a> and here's the output at the end, after the <code>&lt;/think&gt;</code> tag:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Joke:</strong></p>
<p>A pelican and a walrus decide to open a quaint little tea room together. The walrus, with its big size, struggles to find comfortable chairs, so it sits on the table by accident, knocking over the teapot. Meanwhile, the pelican, trying to help, uses its beak to place saucers on the table, causing a few spills.</p>
<p>After a series of comical mishaps, the walrus looks up and says with a grin, "This isn't so fishy anymore." The pelican smirks and remarks, "Maybe not, but we do have a lot of krill in our tea!"</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Setup:</strong> Pelican and Walrus run an unlikely tea room. Their sizes lead to comedic chaos.</li>
<li>
<strong>Punchline:</strong> "This isn't so fishy anymore" is a pun on the situation becoming less absurd. The follow-up joke introduces "krill," a play on words that ties into both marine life ("fish") and tea, making it humorous while fitting the theme.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So yeah, the joke is <em>awful</em>. But the process of getting there was such an interesting insight into how these new models work.</p>
<p>This was a relatively small 8B model. I'm looking forward to trying out the <a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B">Llama 70B version</a>, which isn't yet available in a GGUF I can run with Ollama. Given <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/9/llama-33-70b/">the strength of Llama 3.3 70B</a> - currently my favourite GPT-4 class model that I've run on my own machine - I have high expectations.</p>

<p><strong>Update 21st January 2025</strong>: I got <a href="https://huggingface.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B-GGUF">this quantized version</a> of that Llama 3.3 70B R1 distilled model working like this - a 34GB download:</p>

<pre><code>ollama run hf.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B-GGUF:Q3_K_M</code></pre>

<h4 id="can-it-draw-a-pelican-">Can it draw a pelican?</h4>
<p>I tried <a href="https://github.com/simonw/pelican-bicycle">my classic</a> <code>Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle</code> prompt too. It <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/ddd21a016cd7be74fd3e18407e1e313e">did not do very well</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/r1-peli-1.svg" alt="Blue square, abstract white shape on it" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>It looked to me like it got the order of the elements wrong, so I followed up with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>the background ended up covering the rest of the image</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/ddd21a016cd7be74fd3e18407e1e313e#response-1">thought some more</a> and gave me this:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/r1-peli-2.svg" alt="Blue square, abstract white shape on it" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>As with the earlier joke, the chain of thought in the transcript was far more interesting than the end result.</p>

<h4 id="other-ways-to-try-deepseek-r1">Other ways to try DeepSeek-R1</h4>
<p>If you want to try the model out without installing anything at all you can do so using <a href="https://chat.deepseek.com/">chat.deepseek.com</a> - you'll need to create an account (sign in with Google, use an email address or provide a Chinese +86 phone number) and then select the "DeepThink" option belowe the prompt input box.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/deepseek-chat-deepthink.jpg" alt="Screenshot of DeepSeek Chat showing the DeepThink selected icon" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>DeepSeek offer the model via <a href="https://api-docs.deepseek.com/">their API</a>, using an OpenAI-imitating endpoint. You can access that via LLM by dropping this into <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/other-models.html#openai-compatible-models">your extra-openai-models.yaml configuration file</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-yaml"><pre>- <span class="pl-ent">model_id</span>: <span class="pl-s">deepseek-reasoner</span>
  <span class="pl-ent">model_name</span>: <span class="pl-s">deepseek-reasoner</span>
  <span class="pl-ent">api_key_name</span>: <span class="pl-s">deepseek</span>
  <span class="pl-ent">api_base</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>https://api.deepseek.com<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span><span class="pl-s">%                                                                                            </span></pre></div>
<p>Then run <code>llm keys set deepseek</code> and paste in your API key, then use <code>llm -m deepseek-reasoner 'prompt'</code> to run prompts.</p>
<p>This won't show you the reasoning tokens, sadly. Those are served up by the API (<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/a5ca117dd0325c93a5b1f5a18c4a9e34">example here</a>) but LLM doesn't yet have a way to display them.</p>
<p>Since I published this article <a href="https://www.ollama.com/">Ollama</a> made available their own versions of the DeepSeek models. Confusingly, they've taken the various different distilled models and made them all available as different sizes of their <a href="https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1">deepseek-r1</a> - for example, their 9GB R1 Qwen2.5-14B model is called <code>deepseek-r1:14b</code> and can be run like this:</p>
<pre><code>ollama run deepseek-r1:14b
</code></pre>

## Mac tip of the day: OCR

I remember one of the features that first attracted me to the Mac, back around the turn of the millennium, was its pervasive support for PDFs. On Windows, I&#8217;d had to install cumbersome Adobe software to convert certain formats into PDF documents. On the Mac, any app that could print could create PDFs without the <a class="more-link excerpt-link" href="https://statusq.org/archives/2025/01/20/12373/">Continue Reading<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span></a>
