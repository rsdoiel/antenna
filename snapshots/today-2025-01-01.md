## The Enlightened Economist Prize for 2024

date: 2024-12-31, from: Enlightenment Economics

This decision &#8211; again, entirely arbitrary and my own &#8211; was harder than ever this year because I left the long/shortlisting so late I had little time to mull it over. So I&#8217;m going to follow last year&#8217;s precedent and &#8230; <a href="http://www.enlightenmenteconomics.com/blog/index.php/2024/12/the-enlightened-economist-prize-for-2024/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

date: 2024-12-31, from: Accidentally in Code

As the year wraps up I spent some time thinking about how it went, and what I’m hoping for in 2025. Personal My word for 2024 was connection &#8211; a correction from a multi year pandemic that flowed neatly into [living under a rock] writing a book. I wanted to prioritize being a better friend, [&#8230;]

## Name that Ware, December 2024

date: 2024-12-31, from: Bunnie's Studio Blog

The ware for December 2024 is shown below. This one should be a cakewalk, and I&#8217;m mostly sharing it because I had trouble searching for a recent example at an image quality sufficient to make out most of the part numbers. Maybe this can help someone else in a similar fix! Warm wishes for a [&#8230;]

## Quoting Alexis Gallagher

date: 2024-12-31, updated: 2024-12-31, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<blockquote cite="https://www.answer.ai/posts/2024-12-19-modernbert.html#encoder-only-models"><p>Basically, a frontier model like OpenAI’s O1 is like a Ferrari SF-23. It’s an obvious triumph of engineering, designed to win races, and that’s why we talk about it. But it takes a special pit crew just to change the tires and you can’t buy one for yourself. In contrast, a BERT model is like a Honda Civic. It’s also an engineering triumph, but more subtly, since it is engineered to be affordable, fuel-efficient, reliable, and extremely useful. And that’s why they’re absolutely everywhere.</p></blockquote>
