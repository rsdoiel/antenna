<p>One of my company's values that I'm most proud of is "No Assholes". We will not hire someone who is a rockstar in their work if that person is toxic to the people around them. This is something I believe in very strongly. </p><p>The most important thing is how we treat other humans. If you are a tech bro and think your big idea is so special it gives you the platform to treat others poorly, I have news for you. Your idea isn't special. There's 8 billion people out there and someone else will come up with it themselves soon enough. If the idea has merit and audience, they'll gain it in time.</p><p>This has been a post on reference to what's happening with Pixelfed, but everyone take note. Don't be a dick. Seriously.

<p>I just released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-smollm2">llm-smollm2</a>, a new plugin for <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> that bundles a quantized copy of the <a href="https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct">SmolLM2-135M-Instruct</a> LLM inside of the Python package.</p>
<p>This means you can now <code>pip install</code> a full LLM!</p>

Max's owner, Elena, was determined to make Max happy. She took Max to a beautiful and beautiful place, where Max was allowed to roam freely. Max was allowed to roam freely, and Max was allowed to roam freely. [Then repeats that sentence many times]" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>

<h4 id="finding-a-tiny-model">Finding a tiny model</h4>
<p>The fact that the model is almost exactly 100MB is no coincidence: that's the <a href="https://pypi.org/help/#file-size-limit">default size limit</a> for a Python package that can be uploaded to the Python Package Index (PyPI).</p>
<p>I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/simonwillison.net/post/3lhklqd62jc2x">asked on Bluesky</a> if anyone had seen a just-about-usable GGUF model that was under 100MB, and Artisan Loaf <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/artisanloaf.bsky.social/post/3lhklumfhvs2r">pointed me</a> to <a href="https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct">SmolLM2-135M-Instruct</a>.</p>
<p>I ended up using <a href="https://huggingface.co/QuantFactory/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct-GGUF/tree/main">this quantization</a> by <a href="https://huggingface.co/QuantFactory">QuantFactory</a> just because it was the first sub-100MB model I tried that worked.</p>
<p>Trick for finding quantized models: Hugging Face has a neat "model tree" feature in the side panel of their model pages, which includes links to relevant quantized models. I find most of my GGUFs using that feature.</p>

<h4 id="building-the-plugin">Building the plugin</h4>
<p>I first tried the model out using Python and the <a href="https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python">llama-cpp-python</a> library like this:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>uv run --with llama-cpp-python python</pre></div>
<p>Then:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">from</span> <span class="pl-s1">llama_cpp</span> <span class="pl-k">import</span> <span class="pl-v">Llama</span>

    {<span class="pl-s">"role"</span>: <span class="pl-s">"user"</span>, <span class="pl-s">"content"</span>: <span class="pl-s">"Hi"</span>}
])
<span class="pl-en">pprint</span>(<span class="pl-s1">output</span>)</pre>
<p>This gave me the output I was expecting:</p>
<pre>{<span class="pl-s">'choices'</span>: [{<span class="pl-s">'finish_reason'</span>: <span class="pl-s">'stop'</span>,
              <span class="pl-s">'index'</span>: <span class="pl-c1">0</span>,

<p>But it also <em>spammed</em> my terminal with a huge volume of debugging output - which started like this:</p>
<pre><code>llama_model_load_from_file_impl: using device Metal (Apple M2 Max) - 49151 MiB free
llama_model_loader: loaded meta data with 33 key-value pairs and 272 tensors from SmolLM2-135M-Instruct.Q4_1.gguf (version GGUF V3 (latest))
llama_model_loader: Dumping metadata keys/values. Note: KV overrides do not apply in this output.
llama_model_loader: - kv   0:                       general.architecture str              = llama
</code></pre>
<p>And then continued for more than <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/9ef7acd836b1cc40c14686eae4dca340">500 lines</a>!</p>
<p>I've had this problem with <code>llama-cpp-python</code> and <code>llama.cpp</code> in the past, and was sad to find that the documentation still doesn't have a great answer for how to avoid this.</p>
<p>So I turned to the just released <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/5/gemini-2/">Gemini 2.0 Pro (Experimental)</a>, because I know it's a strong model with a long input limit.</p>
<p>I ran the entire <code>llama-cpp-python</code> codebase through it like this:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre><span class="pl-c1">cd</span> /tmp
git clone https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python
<span class="pl-c1">cd</span> llama-cpp-python
files-to-prompt -e py <span class="pl-c1">.</span> -c <span class="pl-k">|</span> llm -m gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05 \
  <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>How can I prevent this library from logging any information at all while it is running - no stderr or anything like that<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre></div>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/20476c2c6f7604df2994212cebfafef4#response">the answer I got back</a>. It recommended setting the logger to <code>logging.CRITICAL</code>, passing <code>verbose=False</code> to the constructor and, most importantly, using the following context manager to suppress all output:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">from</span> <span class="pl-s1">contextlib</span> <span class="pl-k">import</span> <span class="pl-s1">contextmanager</span>, <span class="pl-s1">redirect_stderr</span>, <span class="pl-s1">redirect_stdout</span>

<span class="pl-en">@<span class="pl-s1">contextmanager</span></span>
<span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">suppress_output</span>():
    <span class="pl-s">"""</span>
<span class="pl-s">    Suppresses all stdout and stderr output within the context.</span>
<span class="pl-s">    """</span>
    <span class="pl-k">with</span> <span class="pl-en">open</span>(<span class="pl-s1">os</span>.<span class="pl-c1">devnull</span>, <span class="pl-s">"w"</span>) <span class="pl-k">as</span> <span class="pl-s1">devnull</span>:
        <span class="pl-k">with</span> <span class="pl-en">redirect_stdout</span>(<span class="pl-s1">devnull</span>), <span class="pl-en">redirect_stderr</span>(<span class="pl-s1">devnull</span>):
            <span class="pl-k">yield</span></pre>
<p>This worked! It turned out most of the output came from initializing the <code>LLM</code> class, so I wrapped that like so:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">with</span> <span class="pl-en">suppress_output</span>():
    <span class="pl-s1">model</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-en">Llama</span>(<span class="pl-s1">model_path</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s1">self</span>.<span class="pl-c1">model_path</span>, <span class="pl-s1">verbose</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-c1">False</span>)</pre>
<p>Proof of concept in hand I set about writing the plugin. I started with my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-plugin">simonw/llm-plugin</a> cookiecutter template:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>uvx cookiecutter gh:simonw/llm-plugin</pre></div>
<pre><code>  [1/6] plugin_name (): smollm2
  [2/6] description (): SmolLM2-135M-Instruct.Q4_1 for LLM
  [3/6] hyphenated (smollm2): 
  [4/6] underscored (smollm2): 
  [5/6] github_username (): simonw
  [6/6] author_name (): Simon Willison
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-smollm2/blob/0.1.1/llm_smollm2/__init__.py">rest of the plugin</a> was mostly borrowed from my existing <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gguf/blob/0.2/llm_gguf.py">llm-gguf</a> plugin, updated based on the latest README for the <code>llama-cpp-python</code> project.</p>
<p>There's more information on building plugins in <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/tutorial-model-plugin.html">the tutorial on writing a plugin</a></p>
<h4 id="packaging-the-plugin">Packaging the plugin</h4>
<p>Once I had that working the last step was to figure out how to package it for PyPI. I'm never quite sure of the best way to bundle a binary file in a Python package, especially one that uses a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file... so I dumped a copy of my existing <code>pyproject.toml</code> file into o3-mini-high and prompted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modify this to bundle a SmolLM2-135M-Instruct.Q4_1.gguf file inside the package. I don't want to use hatch or a manifest or anything, I just want to use setuptools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67a59122-67c8-8006-9be4-29f8419343ad">the shared transcript</a> - it gave me exactly what I wanted. I bundled it by adding this to the end of the <code>toml</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-toml"><pre>[<span class="pl-en">tool</span>.<span class="pl-en">setuptools</span>.<span class="pl-en">package-data</span>]
<span class="pl-smi">llm_smollm2</span> = [<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>SmolLM2-135M-Instruct.Q4_1.gguf<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>]</pre></div>
<p>Then dropping that <code>.gguf</code> file into the <code>llm_smollm2/</code> directory and putting my plugin code in <code>llm_smollm2/__init__.py</code>.</p>
<p>I tested it locally by running this:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>python -m pip install build
python -m build</pre></div>
<p>I fired up a fresh virtual environment and ran <code>pip install ../path/to/llm-smollm2/dist/llm_smollm2-0.1-py3-none-any.whl</code> to confirm that the package worked as expected.</p>
<h4 id="publishing-to-pypi">Publishing to PyPI</h4>
<p>My cookiecutter template comes with <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-smollm2/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yml">a GitHub Actions workflow</a> that publishes the package to PyPI when a new release is created using the GitHub web interface. Here's the relevant YAML:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-yaml"><pre>  <span class="pl-ent">deploy</span>:
    <span class="pl-ent">runs-on</span>: <span class="pl-s">ubuntu-latest</span>

      <span class="pl-ent">uses</span>: <span class="pl-s">pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1</span></pre></div>
<p>This runs after the <code>test</code> job has passed. It uses the <a href="https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish">pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish</a> Action to publish to PyPI - I wrote more about how that works <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/pypi/pypi-releases-from-github">in this TIL</a>.</p>
<h4 id="is-the-model-any-good-">Is the model any good?</h4>
<p>This one really isn't! It's not really surprising but it turns out 94MB really isn't enough space for a model that can do anything useful.</p>
<p>It's <em>super</em> fun to play with, and I continue to maintain that small, weak models are a great way to help build a mental model of how this technology actually works.</p>
<p>That's not to say SmolLM2 isn't a fantastic model family. I'm running the smallest, most restricted version here. <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/smollm">SmolLM - blazingly fast and remarkably powerful</a> describes the full model family - which comes in 135M, 360M, and 1.7B sizes. The larger versions are a whole lot more capable.</p>
<p>If anyone can figure out something genuinely useful to do with the 94MB version I'd love to hear about it.</p>

## sqlite-s3vfs

date: 2025-02-07, updated: 2025-02-07, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/uktrade/sqlite-s3vfs">sqlite-s3vfs</a></strong></p>
Neat open source project on the GitHub organisation for the UK government's Department for Business and Trade: a "Python virtual filesystem for SQLite to read from and write to S3."</p>
<p>I tried out <a href="https://github.com/uktrade/sqlite-s3vfs/blob/main/README.md#usage">their usage example</a> by running it in a Python REPL with all of the dependencies</p>
<pre><code>uv run --python 3.13 --with apsw --with sqlite-s3vfs --with boto3 python
</code></pre>
<p>It worked as advertised. When I listed my S3 bucket I found it had created two files - one called <code>demo.sqlite/0000000000</code> and another called <code>demo.sqlite/0000000001</code>, both 4096 bytes because each one represented a SQLite page.</p>
<p>The implementation is just <a href="https://github.com/uktrade/sqlite-s3vfs/blob/main/sqlite_s3vfs.py">200 lines of Python</a>, implementing a new SQLite Virtual Filesystem on top of <a href="https://rogerbinns.github.io/apsw/vfs.html#vfs-class">apsw.VFS</a>.</p>
<p>The README includes this warning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No locking is performed, so client code <em>must</em> ensure that writes do not overlap with other writes or reads. If multiple writes happen at the same time, the database will probably become corrupt and data be lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder if the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Nov/26/s3-conditional-writes/">conditional writes</a> feature added to S3 back in November could be used to protect against that happening. Tricky as there are multiple files involved, but maybe it (or a <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/30/leader-election-with-s3-conditional-writes/">trick like this one</a>) could be used to implement some kind of exclusive lock between multiple processes?

## APSW SQLite query explainer

date: 2025-02-07, updated: 2025-02-07, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/apsw-query">APSW SQLite query explainer</a></strong></p>
Today I found out about <a href="https://rogerbinns.github.io/apsw/">APSW</a>'s (Another Python SQLite Wrapper, in constant development since 2004) <a href="https://rogerbinns.github.io/apsw/ext.html#apsw.ext.query_info">apsw.ext.query_info()</a> function, which takes a SQL query and returns a <em>very</em> detailed set of information about that query - all without executing it.</p>
<p>It actually solves a bunch of problems I've wanted to address in Datasette - like taking an arbitrary query and figuring out how many parameters (<code>?</code>) it takes and which tables and columns are represented in the result.</p>
<p>I tried it out in my console (<code>uv run --with apsw python</code>) and it seemed to work really well. Then I remembered that the Pyodide project includes WebAssembly builds of a number of Python C extensions and was delighted to <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html">find apsw on that list</a>.</p>
<p>... so I <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/8d79d2a4e746f7c8966d2ae1fea90cb3">got Claude</a> to build me <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/apsw-query">a web interface</a> for trying out the function, using Pyodide to run a user's query in Python in their browser via WebAssembly.</p>
<p>Claude didn't quite get it in one shot - I had to feed it the URL to a more recent Pyodide and it got stuck in a bug loop which I fixed by pasting the code into a fresh session.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of the tool. APSW SQLite query explainer. Query is select * from sqlite_master where tbl_name = ? and a parameter box below is set to example.
