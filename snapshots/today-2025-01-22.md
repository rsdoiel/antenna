## This Is How You Normalize Performing a Fascist Gesture

date: 2025-01-22, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p><i>&#8220;There were angry reactions across Europe to Elon Musk’s apparent use of a salute banned for its Nazi links in Germany, where some condemned it as malicious provocation or an outreach of solidarity to far-right groups.&#8221; &#8212; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/21/the-gesture-speaks-for-itself-germans-divided-over-musks-apparent-nazi-salute">The Guardian</a></i></p> <div class='break'>- - -</div><p>1. Have the wealthiest man on Earth (ideally someone who has gone out of his way, perhaps on a social media platform that he purchased, to lend credibility to even the most shocking hate speech) &#8220;accidentally&#8221; perform the gesture on stage at a victory rally for the fascist autocrat that he spent hundreds of millions of dollars to elect.</p> <p>2. Put out a press release claiming that the gesture was accidental, or an unrelated and totally benign gesture, or can be attributed to his “well-known neurological condition.” Also, isn’t criticizing him&#8212;a person with a condition they can&#8217;t control&#8212;for this accidental gesture a little ableist?</p> <p>3. Have your trusted media pundits ask how anyone could even for a moment think the rich man would do this intentionally, knowing as he does full well the long and tragic history of the gesture. &#8220;Did you know the rich man visited Auschwitz last year? He can&#8217;t be a fascist!&#8221;</p> <p>4. If the rich man once spent his days seeking the approval of a group known for being anti-gesture, point out his very public evolution into someone who sees the anti-gesture group for who they really are: people who harbor evil beliefs because they suffer from a mind virus.</p> <p>5. Encourage the rich man’s ardent fans to suggest that those crucifying this poor rich man are the ones who embody the original meaning of the gesture, that they are the real fascists.</p> <p>6. Put out another press release:</p> <blockquote> <p>&#8220;In light of this vitriol from the so-called tolerant end of the political spectrum about the alleged vileness of the gesture, could it not be said that those who so long condemned it, a mere gesture if we’re being honest, had perhaps, in doing so, become the very thing (i.e., hateful bigots) they vowed to eradicate? Isn’t that a bit ironic? Don’t you think?&#8221;</p> </blockquote> <p>7. Have confidence that your dog whistle has been heard by those it was meant to signal to. What is it signaling? That you <span class="caps">WANT</span> to perform the gesture. Performing the gesture is what you&#8217;ve wanted all along. And now that the pro-gesture crowd has again assumed power, perhaps the time is finally right to resume performing the gesture.</p> <p>8. Sit back and wait because this next part is out of your hands. But it’s a safe bet that it will happen—and it will indeed happen. Soon, those rushing to the rich man’s defense will start performing the gesture ironically.</p> <p>9. The gesture will eventually stop being ironic; the rich man’s supporters will perform the gesture out of solidarity. Only the diehards at first, but then more and more people will adopt the gesture as it becomes decoupled from its original meaning, sanitized for overt public displays, many having no idea, others having at least plausible deniability, that the gesture ever signaled harmful intent.</p> <p>10. Soon, it will be commonplace to perform the gesture. In fact, it will seem crazy not to perform the gesture.</p> <p>11. Acknowledge with a wink those who loved the gesture all along, because they have finally achieved precisely what they set out to do through you, their spiritual heir: making the gesture a symbol and marker of the in-group, the protected and privileged class. Soon thereafter, those in the out-group will be made to perform the gesture as a demonstration of loyalty or else perish.</p>

## r1.py script to run R1 with a min-thinking-tokens parameter

date: 2025-01-22, updated: 2025-01-22, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://gist.github.com/vgel/8a2497dc45b1ded33287fa7bb6cc1adc">r1.py script to run R1 with a min-thinking-tokens parameter</a></strong></p>
Fantastically creative hack by Theia Vogel. The <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/20/deepseek-r1/">DeepSeek R1 family</a> of models output their chain of thought inside a <code>&lt;think&gt;...&lt;/think&gt;</code> block. Theia found that you can intercept that closing <code>&lt;/think&gt;</code> and replace it with "Wait, but" or "So" or "Hmm" and trick the model into extending its thought process, producing better solutions!</p>
<p>You can stop doing this after a few iterations, or you can keep on denying the <code>&lt;/think&gt;</code> string and effectively force the model to "think" forever.</p>
<p>Theia's code here works against Hugging Face transformers but I'm confident the same approach could be ported to llama.cpp or MLX.

## llm-gemini 0.9

date: 2025-01-22, updated: 2025-01-22, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/releases/tag/0.9">llm-gemini 0.9</a></strong></p>
This new release of my <code>llm-gemini</code> plugin adds support for two new experimental models:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>learnlm-1.5-pro-experimental</code> is "an experimental task-specific model that has been trained to align with learning science principles when following system instructions for teaching and learning use cases" - <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/learnlm">more here</a>.</li>
<li>
<p><code>gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21</code> is a brand new version of the Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking model <a href="https://twitter.com/demishassabis/status/1881844417746632910">released today</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Latest version also includes code execution, a 1M token content window &amp; a reduced likelihood of thought-answer contradictions.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The most exciting new feature though is support for <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/grounding">Google search grounding</a>, where some Gemini models can execute Google searches as part of answering a prompt. This feature can be enabled using the new <code>-o google_search 1</code> option.

<p>Tommy Hughes has been developing a whole array of LLM plugins, including his <a href="https://github.com/irthomasthomas/llm-plugin-generator">llm-plugin-generator</a> which is a plugin that can help write new plugins!</p>
<p>He started by demonstrating <a href="https://github.com/irthomasthomas/llm-model-gateway">llm-model-gateway</a>, a plugin that adds a <code>llm serve</code> command which starts a localhost server running an imitation of the OpenAI API against LLM models:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>llm install llm-model-gateway
llm serve</pre></div>
<p>Tommy's main demo was of <a href="https://github.com/irthomasthomas/llm-consortium">llm-consortium</a>, a plogin which can use a consortium of collaborating LLM models working together to solve problems.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>llm install llm-consortium
llm consortium <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Best way to prepare avocado toast<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> \

  --models gpt-4o \
  --arbiter gegemini-1.5-pro-latest \
  --confidence-threshold 0.8 \
  --max-iterations 3 \
  --output results.json</pre></div>
<p>I ran this and got back:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best way to prepare avocado toast involves selecting quality ingredients and careful preparation. Start with a thick slice of good quality bread, such as sourdough or whole grain. Toast it to your preferred level of crispness.  While the bread is toasting, prepare a ripe avocado. Cut it in half, remove the pit, and scoop the flesh into a bowl. Mash the avocado with a fork, leaving some chunks for texture. Season with salt, black pepper, and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to prevent browning.  Optional additions include a touch of red pepper flakes.</p>
<p>Once the toast is ready, let it cool slightly before spreading the seasoned avocado evenly over it. Consider lightly rubbing a cut garlic clove on the warm toast for an extra layer of flavor (optional).</p>
<p>Enhance your avocado toast with your favorite toppings. Popular choices include: everything bagel seasoning, sliced tomatoes, radishes, a poached or fried egg (for added protein), microgreens, smoked salmon (for a more savory option), feta cheese crumbles, or a drizzle of hot sauce.  For a finishing touch, drizzle with high-quality olive oil and sprinkle with sesame or chia seeds for added texture.</p>
<p>Consider dietary needs when choosing toppings. For example, those following a low-carb diet might skip the tomatoes and opt for more protein and healthy fats.</p>
<p>Finally, pay attention to presentation. Arrange the toppings neatly for a visually appealing toast. Serve immediately to enjoy the fresh flavors and crispy toast.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the really interesting thing is the full log of the prompts and responses sent to Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o, followed by a combined prompt to Gemini 1.5 Pro to have it arbitrate between the two responses.

## Behavior-driven development with LLMs

date: 2025-01-21, from: Memo Garcia blog

It is tempting to tell an LLM, “Build me a CRUD API in FastAPI,” and watch it do its thing. And sure, it’s amazing that:
LLMs can very vague requirements, and That we are able to “talk” to computers this way However, this tend to very a very imperative and not so repetable approach. This makes things “difficult” to predict and validate against an expected outcome.
It also makes difficult to test different LLMs on the same task to validate correctness, speed and price.

## Why Are People Leaving This City We’ve Made Impossible to Live In?

date: 2025-01-21, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p>As city leaders, we’re stunned we’re losing thousands and thousands of residents who say they can’t build a life here. We don’t understand why they’re leaving, even after we’ve spent all our time in office making this city absolutely inhospitable to working people.</p> <p>The building block of a comfortable life is housing, so we’re surprised to hear people struggle to find affordable homes. Maybe they’re not considering all of their options. Perhaps they could move to a cheaper, outer borough like the Bronx or Queens, or an outer-outer borough like Long Island, or an outer-space borough like our new colony on Jupiter’s moon Ganymede (six months&#8217; rent required at signing).</p> <p>Don’t limit yourself to movement on our three-dimensional plane. How about time-traveling back to 1987 to buy a dilapidated brownstone and then waiting forty years to cash out at the expense of the suckers who made the bad decision to be born after you? After all, that’s what every elected official did.</p> <p>The families that can afford to stay here still whine, especially about our transit system. We thought parents loved it; they can spend all day hauling double strollers down rain-flooded stairs to the open kiln we call a subway station in August. It’s hours of free, heatstroke-inducing fun for the whole family, unless anyone in that family needs an elevator. In that case, may I refer you to our new outpost on Jupiter’s moon Ganymede? There are no elevators there either, but in space, no one can hear you complain.</p> <p>Also, we don’t know how people flee this city so quickly; they’re certainly not doing it on our crumbling public transit.</p> <p>Even the people who ride bicycles have problems. I don’t understand why they can’t find secure bike parking. All of our city employees manage to park their two-ton SUVs on sidewalks and in bike lanes. Surely, you can squeeze your little pedal-toy thing between them.</p> <p>Don’t even get us started on the walkers. Constant boohooing about reckless drivers blowing through crosswalks. Is it a bad thing we offer impromptu mobile parkour options for our residents? In other cities, you’d pay top dollars to try and barrel-roll over a Chevy Tahoe, but here, you can do it for free whenever you need a gallon of milk.</p> <p>Everyone who leaves should think of the opportunities they’re denying their children, whom they can’t afford to raise in our incredibly expensive city. We’re home to the best education in the world, teaching millions of kids it’s not about where you’re born or who your parents are but who your parents know on an admissions committee (mine knew the guy whose great-great-grandfather invented hats).</p> <p>And they’re leaving even though we announced free preschool for all kids. We didn’t follow through in any way, but it was a heck of an announcement. Balloons, streamers, an <span class="caps">FBI</span> raid in the middle of the press conference: It had it all (except an actual plan).</p> <p>Like we said, it’s expensive to live in this city. You may have to get financially creative and cut back on some essentials, like Netflix subscriptions or paying any of your taxes. It works great for our rich friends; they have plenty of cash left over to donate to our campaigns.</p> <p>These fleeing families talk a lot about “quality of life,” but not enough people talk about shutting up and white-knuckling your way through an arbitrarily more difficult existence in this playground for the uber wealthy we’ve created. Could things be better? Shut up. Wait, where are you going, and what exactly is a “Philadelphia”?</p> <p>Progress is often slow and difficult to come by, especially when we’re working so hard to stall it. The only thing left to do is keep moving forward in our official government <span class="caps">SUV</span>, past the noise, past this pedestrian-filled crosswalk, and past whatever is under our front bumper, pleading, “Help me.”</p>

## I Am a Disappointed Trump Voter Who Was Told It Would Be the Past by Now

date: 2025-01-21, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p>Well, they say you should never trust a politician, and it seems I’ve been duped.</p> <p>For months before and since I cast my vote for Donald J. Trump—and yes, I’m one of those people who really leans into the “J” for some reason—I have been promised by every reliable source that change was finally coming to America, after four years of the failed leadership of Joe Biden and then the four years before that, which I can’t remember.</p> <p>But it’s abundantly clear that the Trump presidency is delivering more of the same. And it’s the bad kind of same that’s been happening lately, not the good kind of same like from the good old days. When men could be men, women could be women, and I didn’t have to go to work or pay for anything because I was a child.</p> <p>On issue after issue, we are being force-fed “now” when we were promised “then.”</p> <p>Take rising prices. On January 20, at noon sharp, I busted down the door of my local grocery store like it was Black Friday—and after management told me that the door would’ve opened automatically if I had waited two more seconds, I was shocked by what I saw.</p> <p>A dozen eggs still cost four dollars. So did a gallon of milk. And my fifth-grade teacher, who I used to run into all the time there? Still dead.</p> <p>Something was wrong. I thought maybe these grocery workers were some sort of uncontacted people who were living under the tragic illusion that Joe Biden was still president. But no. They’re modern people. They keep up with the news through Facebook, just like you and me. And yet, they were acting as if there was no difference between the day Biden left office and the day Trump took office.</p> <p>Then there’s the male loneliness epidemic. The voices who talk to me in my head—mostly Barstool hosts via my earbuds—convinced me that maybe this terrible feeling of isolation they told me I was experiencing might finally be a thing of the past. But even though I voted for the guy who has spent decades betraying absolutely every single person in his life as soon as they no longer suit his immediate needs, I still have no friends.</p> <p>I was also promised that my vote would bring an end to <span class="caps">DEI</span>, ERGs, <span class="caps">CSR</span>, and <span class="caps">LGBTQ</span>, leaving only real American letters like <span class="caps">UFC</span> and <span class="caps">EIEIO</span>. And yet, when I showed up to work this morning, not a single one of my female co-workers had vanished in a puff of smoke. And also, they still won’t let me smoke at work! What decade is this—not the 1950s?</p> <p>Then I got home, turned on the TV, and found that the Washington Commanders are still called the Washington Commanders? And they’re doing crazy hot right now? And the couples in the commercials for my favorite erectile dysfunction pills are still interracial? And they’re crazy hot right now?</p> <p>To let off some steam, I went to the globe store to see if I could get my model globe replaced—now that the United States is acquiring Greenland, Canada, Mexico, and Panama, and I imagine the UN would probably throw in some random bonus ones, like Suriname. But the disgruntled employee at the front desk insisted mine was up to date and that none of those places are states yet—presumably because she’s one of those deep-state operatives that the administration still hasn’t gotten around to axing.</p> <p>Now, to be fair, Donald Trump has kept some promises. He brought back TikTok. And he did it so effectively that it happened on the last guy’s watch.</p> <p>But everything else about his presidency thus far implies that Donald Trump is the same guy he was eight years ago, doomed to disappoint as compared to the extravagantly transformative promises he has made. That even he is subject to political gravity and the constraints, however loosened, of the Constitution.</p> <p>And if that’s the case, let me draw a clear line in the sand: I will not be voting for him in 2028.</p>

## What Makes a Good Team?

date: 2025-01-21, from: Accidentally in Code

No team is perfect, but I think it’s often kind of obvious when a team is bad &#8211; there’s usually a level of chaos or drama, a sense that they can’t be relied on or don’t really deliver the value that the organization needs. I think it’s also quite obvious when a team is good, [&#8230;]

## Beyond “Prompt and Pray”

date: 2025-01-21, from: O'Reilly Radar

TL;DR: Enterprise AI teams are discovering that purely agentic approaches (dynamically chaining LLM calls) don’t deliver the reliability needed for production systems. The prompt-and-pray model—where business logic lives entirely in prompts—creates systems that are unreliable, inefficient, and impossible to maintain at scale. A shift toward structured automation, which separates conversational ability from business logic execution, [&#8230;]

## Welcome Home, President Nyarlathotep

date: 2025-01-21, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p>Please allow me to take your umbrella, <a href="https://www.mcsweeneys.net/columns/the-dread-lord-nyarlathotep-presidential-library">Dread Lord</a>. My advisors informed me this morning during my final daily presidential briefing that Hell had frozen over in honor of your return. They certainly made their decision frigidly clear, by golly. I’m happy the Capitol One Arena could accommodate the final details of your resummoning ritual on such short notice. The intestinal pedestal erected so the guests of honor from TikTok, Meta, Amazon, and SpaceX can properly show fealty by licking your pustuled tentacle was a particularly nice touch.</p> <p>I know we do not see eye-to-eye sockets on most things. As President these past four years, I repeatedly <a href="https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/well-we-gave-nyarlathotep-a-chance-and-he-gave-us-four-years-of-horror-but-its-time-to-move-on-as-a-nation">tried to remind the nation</a> about the unequivocal evidence that you are not a “rational human being” in any traditional sense of the term but rather an Outer God of Chaos devoid of any semblance of conscience, humility, or even sentient logic. You, meanwhile, cursed my family with bile plagues, plotted retribution from your Shadow Palace at Mar-a-Lago, and raged incoherently from some surreal psychic plane known in the common tongue as Truth Social. You also somehow managed to eternally infect millions of American minds with false visions of nightmarish and imaginary foes, bird-murdering windmills, and cheap eggs.</p> <p>But never mind that you’re a convicted necromancer with a paper trail linking you to every conceivable atrocity, crime against natural law, and humiliating deviance. The country made its voice loud and clear last November—and by “loud and clear,” I mean less than 23 percent of the nation’s total population.</p> <p>So it goes. The gears of this Great Nation grind on, no matter who or how many people beg us to stop and reconsider. My only responsibility today is to pass the torch that will help illuminate a new era that’s somehow more hauntingly grotesque, bleak, and horrifying than your first.</p> <p>Some say I, in my tenure as Commander-in-Chief, could have helped silence the trumpets that began heralding your apocalyptic return from nearly the moment I assumed the presidency. Critics in my own party say I should have encased the Necronomicon in tetanus-riddled barbed wire and used one of Elon’s rockets to jettison it into the sun. Or, perhaps, I should have properly outfitted the country’s already problematically powerful Witchfinder Generals to root out your mindless goblin horde that stormed the Capitol in a last-ditch effort to appease you. I was even informed there is some pretty clear language in the Constitution’s tattered remnants that explicitly lay out a simple legal spell to banish you back to the Salted Plains of Mar-a-Lago for the rest of your unnatural life.</p> <p>To which I say: Look, it really was more a top-to-bottom failure of every conceivable institutional safeguard that brought us here. Maybe even a fatal flaw in capitalism’s occultic fabric that inevitably metastasizes humanity’s worse inclinations. I’m just spitballing, but maybe American worship of wealth exacerbates these baser tendencies toward a societal breaking point. And, once broken, that rending in reality charts a direct path for a Stalker Among the Stars such as yourself into the Oval Office</p> <p>I’m just saying, they can’t really lay it all at my feet, alright? I’m sure you and I can at least agree on that. Well, that and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/biden-pardons-family.html">pardoning</a> our respective progeny.</p> <p>But at the end of the day, I suppose I don’t care what the political historians, marginalized constituents, fearful targets of your ire, experts in the arcane, or my own tired eyes tried to tell me. For reasons I have never been able to articulate convincingly, I believe the American Democratic Experiment is greater than any one vindictive and insatiable Elder God.</p> <p>I know you campaigned on a renewed platform of “I See All, And It Shall Burn.” I know innumerable cretins, nihilists, billionaires, and crypto bros are at the gates, salivating at the Body Politic’s final, shuddering gasps. But it’s either this or permitting Americans to realize the truth: Humanity is still capable of conjuring its own protective communities—and that scares the shit out of feckless politicians, soul-shirking opportunists, and maybe even Outer Gods.</p> <p>But if my hunch is correct—and hey, there’s a first time for everything—we should be good to go. So, before I escort you into the Inauguration Day Fealty Orgy, let me be the first to say: Welcome home, Dread Lord Nyarlathotep.</p>
