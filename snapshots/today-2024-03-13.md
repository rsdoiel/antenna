## 2024-03-07 Why do we even blog?

date: 2024-03-13, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-03-07-why-do-we-even-blog">2024-03-07 Why do we even blog?</h1>

<p>The urge to blog lives in a strange place. One speaks to an imagined audience. It
is not enough to imagine an audience, though. It&rsquo;s more than writing into a
booklet, &ldquo;Dear Diary, …&rdquo; – and yet we do it even if there are no comments.
Sure, I never had a lot of comments. But I think I&rsquo;m just as happy getting the
occasional email or reply on the fediverse. The thought of somebody reading the
words is terrifying. And once I got that first comment, once I started linking
the blog from my profiles, putting it out there for others to find, inviting people to read and
implicitly, to judge… I started discovered that the blog was something I feared.
The blog is a thrill. It makes me nervous. The heart beats. The heart bleeds.</p>

<p>Back when the blog had comments, I used to be anxious about comments. First, there&rsquo;s a
comment. Is it good or bad? Do I read it now? Do I risk a look? But then the
imagined audience is still there and now it&rsquo;s worse. How will I react as I am being watched?
Blogging turns into a performance where I feel like I&rsquo;m demonstrating my moral character. I am
not a racist! I am not a white supremacist! I am not a homophobe! Or am I? All
the discourse online has made me self-conscious. I really
don&rsquo;t want to be what I fear I might be without knowing it. I keep thinking of
the idea that people who aren&rsquo;t very observant being unable to perceive their
own faults. The requirements go up when I learn more.</p>

<p>The effect of all that anxiety, for me, is that I take things seriously. Words
are serious. I try to put my word where my heart is. I try to weight them
carefully. I weigh my heart. Writing is morally intense. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how
long or how short the page, how trivial or how controversial the topic.</p>

<p>And above all of it hangs the grey sky of unspoken words, of thoughts unexamined
and all that maladjustment, all the failures, all the judgements. How often have
I found myself falling short of my own measure.</p>

<p>To blog is to wrestle with that. I imagine an audience that is strangely
interested in all the things I am interested in. I write for them, for me, for
my future self that looks back, the heart full of regret. I struggle for virtue
and I put it into words for you and me, the imagined reader and myself. As proof.
&ldquo;I struggled!&rdquo; I struggle. I keep on struggling to discover what is right and
to do what is right.</p>

<p>Blogging is like writing secret confessions. I write about the things that I
think I did well because I did them wrong and then I changed my mind. I write
about the things I know because I did not know them before. And who cares about
those laborious system administration blog posts where I struggle with this or
that ephemeral problem. All these issues are lost pages. Nobody cares. People
find their answers on Stack Overflow or Reddit or some other centralized
platform where middlemen gamify the experience so that we can help each other
while on the thread-mill for their pockets. And who cares about those blog posts
about growing old or playing games? People read them and move on. Like I do,
when I&rsquo;m reading online. Even if I am moved, I will move on. And there are so
many posts to read, the folders on my disk with saved articles and snippets are
more like compost heaps, where layer upon layer of good stuff gets dropped,
never to see the light of day again.</p>

<p>Perhaps it sparked a thought somewhere, and perhaps that spark starts a fire,
somewhere, much later. There is practically no connection and that is fine. The
world moves and humanity is moved like a dreamer, one thought knows not the
next, and we all partake in that eternal digestion of the sleepless mind. Our
books, our journals, our blogs, our posts, they all participate. Perhaps we
fall for those waves of outrage and the galaxy brain has a seizure as we all
throw our weight around in unison, crushing innocent lives, leaving those we
hurt behind, forgetting them as quickly as we forget about the outrage.</p>

<p>Or perhaps blogging is leaving a trail of blazing sparks, each one sparking a
fire in the next generation. Spending time reading blogs and posts on social
media has certainly changed me.</p>

<p>Perhaps I would have grown older differently without reading blogs and blogging.
And this is why I cannot stop blogging.
To blog in that half-shadow where perhaps our thoughts are read and
perhaps they are not, where every text lights up and shines and drops and sinks
onto that great pile where thousands of text are rotting, that is to participate
in the galaxy brain that is our world. Some of us can vote and some of us can
talk. Some of us can fight and some of us will weep. I try to blog.</p>

<p>I try to blog to prove to myself that it was a struggle, that I tried to think
long and hard about things and that I tried to do the right thing. I keep
failing and so I must keep blogging.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Blogs">#Blogs</a></p>

<p>p1k3 wrote back in 2022:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Writing about writing. Programming about programming. Meetings about meetings. The mind reflecting on its own function. … Writing about writing might not have quite the same potential for nested, generative dysfunction, but it often produces artifacts just as unintelligible. – <a href="https://p1k3.com/2020/5/20/">meta meta</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That quote seemed very appropriate for one of the two threads in my posts.
The other thread is about the audience and I got a comment on that, too, by the same author:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not that I have much to add here, but I do relate to this one.  The ongoing tension of these feelings contrasted with the sense that (as I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve said many times before) existing in public seems almost entirely unsupportable to me now.  And yet:  Nothing else has quite the same power as writing for this audience you can never be sure of.  The one that might not even exist, but if it does might be all kinds of things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The pain of existing in public is a great way to put it.</p>

<p><strong>2024-03-08</strong>. How to overcome that impostor feeling where you reread that text you wrote and you want to throw it away.
Not worth the electrons it was written with! But who&rsquo;s doing the judging: you, or that imagined audience I was talking about?</p>

<p>I think the point of blogging is for there to be a tiny, non-threatening audience.
And really, who is going to read my blog?
Internet stranger-friends, mutuals on fedi, those kinds of people. Maybe my parents. (Hi mom!)
I can always anonymoblog somewhere else if I&rsquo;m feeling anxious.
Because writing in a paper notebook I don&rsquo;t feel judged.
Surely there&rsquo;s a similar place, online.
The key is to find that happy state where the imagined audience adds a little zest but not the Twitter wolves or Hacker News, or whatever the particular blogging nightmare might be.</p>

<p>For me, this imagined audience is more important than getting it right. Which is why I write my blog posts with the wiki spirit.
All these sites are pretty similar, in essence. Blog, wiki, digital garden, Zettelkasten, there&rsquo;s not enough difference to draw lines.
It&rsquo;s all a question of intent, of culture, of belonging.
The blog spirit is to write pages over time, and they disappear into the archive.
The digital garden spirit is to write unfinished articles and papers, to be refined or not.
The Zettelkasten spirit is to follow the trail of thoughts you thought and add new branches, small notes with new thoughts leading to more thoughts on new notes.
And the wiki spirit is to write and edit online, to hit the Save button and then it&rsquo;s live.
There is no editor, there is no draft. Wiki is like brutalism in content management.
I can see the page sources and the end result is obvious and full of that old web power.
It&rsquo;s not an app. The software has no idea of process.
The wiki spirit is to open that window, write the text and hit save.
And then I read it again, and edit it.
And tomorrow, I read it again, and edit it.
And next week, perhaps, I read it again, and edit it.</p>

<p>I no longer live in the <a href="https://communitywiki.org/wiki/WikiNow">Wiki Now</a>. The pages are intended for future readers but they are not timeless. I add timestamps all over the place. The blog spirit is strong. The pages do disappear into the great compost of thoughts.
The archive gobbles them up. I do go back but I don&rsquo;t rewrite the pages completely.
I&rsquo;m more likely to simply add a timestamp and some thoughts like I did on this page.</p>

<p>I do remove stuff I stumble across that I don&rsquo;t like at all.
I do leave some bad things in there to remind me of bad decisions made, of bad opinions held.</p>

<p>What I want to say, most of all, is that blog posts aren&rsquo;t gems.
They are not precious books. They are not newspaper articles. They are not job applications.
And if I don&rsquo;t like it tomorrow, I edit it. I revise it.
Or I write a new page saying how I learned something, or regret something, or I add something.
I add stuff to the bottom of pages or I add new pages.
What I don&rsquo;t do is polish the old posts.
There will be more great posts in the future.
The important part is the writing.</p>

<p><strong>2024-03-09</strong>. I’m reading <a href="http://perfors.net/blog/creation-ai/">The work of creation in the age of AI</a> by Andrew Perfors and thinking about the part where meaning is discussed.</p>

<p>Meaning without an audience:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I am writing an essay or diary entry to myself, the goal is … generally to clarify my own thoughts, to identify flaws in my thinking, or to distil the logic and motivations behind my ideas. I might have a more emotional goal - I might want to vent to myself or to express a feeling. I might want to improve my emotional regulation, feel better about life, or change those feelings somehow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then with an audience:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>… once I decided I might actually want to post it, I changed it in important ways. I included a lot more explanation of things that were clear in my head but I thought would be non-obvious to others (and, in so doing, often I clarified them for myself too!). I fiddled with the structure and the argument flow, took some things out, put others in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I got an email from <a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@bouncepaw" title="@bouncepaw@merveilles.town">@bouncepaw</a> with a link to <a href="https://links.bouncepaw.com/1188">a reply</a>. Thanks!</p>

<p>This is how it starts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This article gets better every time I open it because Alex adds something to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wrote about my propensity to “add” to pages up above (I’m doing it again!) and perhaps this would be a good place to talk about the two “views” for this site: blog &amp; wiki.</p>

<p>A blog is organized by the timeline. The <a href="index">Home</a> page lists all the pages in the order of their creation.</p>

<p>A wiki is organized by Recent Changes. The <a href="changes">Changes</a> page lists all the pages recently edited (unless I unset a checkbox).</p>

<p>So this site has both natures. And both views have a feed: <a href="index.rss">blog feed</a> &amp; <a href="changes.rss">wiki feed</a>.</p>

<p>I think you need quite some wiki-affinity to subscribe to the wiki feed. But it’s there for you.</p>

<p><strong>2024-03-10</strong>. Got another reply by email, <a href="//redterminal.org/gemlog/2024-03-10-Re_Why_do_we_even_blog.gmi">by fab</a> – who hosts their site on Gopher, Gemini, and the web. Reminds me of the time I had a working <a href="Gopher">Gopher</a> setup. And now I’m remembering the endless bot spiders. Yikes. I still think there should be a way to better control the bots.</p>

<p><strong>2024-03-11</strong>. Dozens also wrote a blog about blogging!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You may be wondering where blogs come from and why you would do a blog. If so, keep reading! – <a href="https://chrismanbrown.gitlab.io/46.html">doing a blog</a></p>

And none of the big journalists even asked the question -- where is this asshole coming from. Our journalists, today, who protest that we need them to keep our democracy, and then they assassinate it. When are we ever going to stand up and put a stop to this. BTW, Substack where she hosts her incredible writing, makes it impossible to find a web link to a story you recieve via email. It's very easy to get to the article in their app. I prefer the open web, and always will. I don't want Substack's app.

## 2024-03-13 Marking the Web’s 35th Birthday: A Shorter Letter

date: 2024-03-13, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-03-13-marking-the-web-s-35th-birthday-a-shorter-letter">2024-03-13 Marking the Web’s 35th Birthday: A Shorter Letter</h1>

<p>I think there are people with more interesting ideas than what Tim Berners-Lee has to say, given what I just read. <a href="https://medium.com/@timberners_lee/marking-the-webs-35th-birthday-an-open-letter-ebb410cc7d42">His post</a> is on Medium so I had to read in eww, the browser built into Emacs. 😂 The most interesting fragment was this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>collectivise their solutions, and … overturn the online world being dictated by profit to one that is dictated by the needs of humanity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty much out of context because it follows something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there is a need, an urgent need, for others to do the same, to back the morally courageous leadership that is rising</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How weird is that? I started thinking. Where is that morally courageous leadership that is rising? Are they morally courageous but not in other ways? Is their morality courageous because their morals aren&rsquo;t recognized as morals or their morals might seem amoral to others? Or is amorality considered moral in the mainstream? Or isn&rsquo;t it rather that the mainstream knows full well what is moral but can&rsquo;t help the systemic pressures of having to earn money? Why isn&rsquo;t he advocating for system change? Is that what collectivisation is about? What exactly are we collectivising? The solutions? The products? The capital? Or is he just saying that the morally ambiguous but courageous leaders have ideas that we, collectively, ought to support? And the &ldquo;fundamental change&rdquo; he has in mind are &ldquo;Contract for the Web&rdquo; and &ldquo;Solid Protocol&rdquo;? I… I don&rsquo;t know… We must &ldquo;champion the efforts of those visionary individuals who are actively working to build a new, improved system&rdquo;? It just feels so weird. How about this alternative:</p>

<ol>
<li>We need a web that is built for the people, by the people.</li>
<li>We need free ourselves from the shackles and fetters of corporations.</li>
<li>Remove corporations and their representatives from all governing bodies and committees.</li>
<li>All positions to be paid positions. Don&rsquo;t let those on the corporate payrolls take over.</li>
<li>One human, one vote. No strings attached. Don&rsquo;t tie votes to membership fees. This is for all of humanity.</li>
</ol>

<p>It took me two minutes to write something that seemed a bit more visionary than what Tim Berners-Lee had in mind and if you like it, please don&rsquo;t champion me but talk to some friends and do a little thing, no matter how small, to support a few more people on the web. Run a forum, a wiki, provide email services, run a fediverse instance, run a HTML course at the library, collect money for a mutual aid fund, something, anything. The only conditions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>it must be a concrete thing that you are actually doing</li>
<li>it must benefit more people than are involved in doing it</li>
</ol>

<p>It&rsquo;s OK to cap it. But it&rsquo;s important to start it. Just make it a point to enable somebody else. And just like that, we&rsquo;re taking back the web.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Web">#Web</a></p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://social.piewpiew.se/@ohyran" title="@ohyran@social.piewpiew.se">@ohyran</a> commented on fedi:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Its hardware all the way down&rdquo;. The internet created this fantasy of a secondary realm outside of the physical confines of our reality - that allowed us to think that the person who controlled the narrative in that alternative universe had some control. In fact the people in control of hardware, if that&rsquo;s servers or cables or switches, are in control. There is no second reality.</p>

## Why both Vision Pro & Quest are Good & Great?

If you have been a regular reader, then you&#160;know&#160;very well how I feel about Vision Pro, which is the best entertainment device I have ever owned (outside of my iPad.)

## Intel continues prepping the Linux kernel for X86S

date: 2024-03-13, from: OS News

Nearly one year ago Intel published the X86S specification (formerly stylized as &#8220;X86-S&#8221;) for simplifying the Intel architecture by removing support for 16-bit and 32-bit operating systems. X86S is a big step forward with dropping legacy mode, 5-level paging improvements, and other modernization improvements for x86_64. With the Linux 6.9 kernel more x86S bits are in place for this ongoing effort. ↫ Michael Larabel I doubt we&#8217;ll see much fallout from these changes.

## Judge in Georgia Election Case Dismisses Some Trump Charges

date: 2024-03-13, from: VOA News USA

ATLANTA, GEORGIA — The judge overseeing the Georgia election interference case on Wednesday dismissed some of the charges against former President Donald Trump, but many other counts in the indictment remain. 


Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee wrote in an order that six of the counts in the indictment must be quashed, including three against Trump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee. 


But the order leaves intact other charges, and the judge wrote that prosecutors could seek a new indictment on the charges he dismissed. 


The six charges are about soliciting elected officials to violate their oaths of office. That includes two charges related to the phone call Trump made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, on January 2, 2021. 


"All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have," Trump said. 


The case accuses Trump and 18 others of conspiring to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state to Democrat Joe Biden. Trump has pleaded not guilty. 


The ruling comes as McAfee is also considering a bid by defendants to have Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis removed from the case. Defendants have alleged that Willis has a conflict of interest because of her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade.

## An important consideration about Pi 5 overclocking

<p>Now that the Raspberry Pi 5s been readily available (at least in <em>most</em> regions) for a few months, more people started messing with clocks, trying to get the most speed possible out of their Pi 5s.</p>

<p>Unlike the Pi 4, the Pi 5 is typically comfortable at 2.6 or even 2.8 GHz, and some Pi 5s can hit 3.0 GHz (but no higher—more on why tomorrow).</p>

<p>After some testing, I found the <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/overclocking-and-underclocking-raspberry-pi-5">default 2.4 GHz clock on the Pi 5 is pretty much the efficiency sweet spot</a>, and after a <em>lot</em> more testing recently, I can confirm that's still the case, testing a number of Pi 5 samples.</p></div>

## Inside Chile’s plan to shorten the workweek

date: 2024-03-13, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>A year ago, Chilean officials voted to reduce the workweek from 45 hours, longer than in most industrialized countries, to 40. The new rule gives businesses until 2028 to tick down to 40 and is aimed at improving work-life balance. We check how the rollout is going. And the S&amp;P 500 closed at a record high on Tuesday. Can the good times last? We hear the bull&#8217;s case for the market.</p>

## When Will Methane Emissions Fall?

date: 2024-03-13, from: Heatmap News

<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> Storms dropped hail stones big enough to leave craters in the ground in Argentina • Denver is expecting more than a foot of snow • A wildfire outbreak is possible in Texas and Oklahoma.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. IEA: Methane emissions from energy still high but could fall soon</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Methane emissions from energy production around the world reached a record high in 2019, and have remained at that level ever since, with 2023 being no exception, according to the International Energy Agency’s <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d6a3b3b7e9&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2024 Global Methane Tracker</a>. Methane is a greenhouse gas that traps more heat than carbon dioxide, and is responsible for about one-third of the total rise in global temperatures compared to pre-industrial levels. Fossil fuel production is not the only source of methane emissions, but it is a big one, and it is within our control. Improvements to oil and gas infrastructure can reduce methane leaks, for example.

</p><p>
	Last year oil, gas, and coal producers added more than 120 million metric tonnes of methane to the atmosphere, a number that is “unacceptably high,” said the IEA’s chief energy economist Tim Gould. The agency called for a 75% reduction in methane emissions from fossil fuels this decade to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and said new policies, pledges, and methane-tracking satellites could bring emissions down soon. “If all methane pledges made by countries and companies to date are implemented in full and on time, it would be sufficient to cut methane emissions from fossil fuels by 50% by 2030,” the IEA said. “However, most pledges are not yet backed up by plans for implementation.”

<strong></strong>The Biden administration yesterday <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=08104050f9&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released</a> details of its plan to create the infrastructure needed to electrify the nation’s trucking fleet. “Heavy duty vehicles have a disproportionate effect on pollution, as large diesel engines release many more particulate emissions than light-duty vehicles do,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=b9d6edc9c6&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a> Jameson Dow at <em>Electrek</em>. Indeed the transportation sector accounts for about 30% of the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions, and more than a fifth of that comes from the biggest trucks. Phase 1 of the plan is to build out charging and hydrogen fueling hubs along some 12,000 miles of roads between 2024 and 2027, targeting some of the busiest routes first, including those around major ports. After the hubs are established, the subsequent phases would then connect those hubs to one another, and then expand the network. Here is a look at the hubs:

The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FOA) hosts the annual gathering so the “main stakeholders of the global banana supply-chain work together to achieve consensus on best practices for sustainable production and trade.” This week the event took place in Rome, and climate change was top of the agenda. “Farmers are battling daily with unpredictable weather patterns, scorching sun, floods, hurricanes, and increased cases of plant diseases,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=989345743e&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Anna Pierides, a sustainable sourcing manager at the Fairtrade Foundation. She warned that farmers may go out of business if they do not get more support and see fairer prices. “There will be some price increases, indeed,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=abb41aff4e&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Pascal Liu, senior economist at the FAO. “If there’s not a major increase in supply, I project that banana prices will remain relatively high in the coming years.” Bananas are the world’s most exported fruit.

The 21-year-old climate activist and other protesters began their demonstration there yesterday, protesting against what they see as inaction from political leaders in addressing the climate crisis. After Thunberg refused to move, police lifted her by the arms and put her about 20 meters away from the building’s door.

We’re not talking about “lab grown” meat here, but plant products made to taste like meat. Animal agriculture accounts for up to 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=de55773fc6&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the United Nations</a>, and meat consumption is expected to grow by 50% by 2050. Meat alternatives could reduce the environmental footprint of the food system, but only if they taste good enough to convert enough meat lovers. Last week Oscar Mayer <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e9643b903e&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> it had partnered with a Bezos-backed food startup to create meatless hot dogs and sausages that “not only deliver on great taste, but also bring the smell, appearance, texture, and grill marks consumers desire and want.”

They went from being a team that could barely put a starting five on the court to having the deepest bench in the NBA. I was trying to do the math, but came up empty. They were absolutely unstoppable. Now that they have two superstars on the court at once, the opposing team can't just double or triple-team the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson">one player</a>, it's basically impossible to defend against their schtick. At the same time, the Knicks are great at defense. When the <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10112788-knicks-tom-thibodeau-provides-julius-randle-update-amid-shoulder-injury-rehab">second injured player</a> comes back, and it seems that will be soon, we might be back in the January mode that was so exciting. Even so, last night's game was a return to greatness. They blew out the 76ers, something that would have been unthinkable a couple of years ago. It's fun being a Knicks fan again! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">❤️</span>

## Argentina’s inflation rate finally falls

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Argentina&#8217;s inflation — the world&#8217;s highest — has slowed down from 20.6% in January to 13.2% in February. Then, hundreds of U.K. post office managers were wrongly prosecuted after faulty computer software calculated that money was missing from their branches. Today, the government will introduce legislation to quash the convictions. And businesses in Chile are preparing to cut their employees&#8217; hours from 45 to 40 hours a week following a new law.</p>

	Few people have shaped Bidenomics more than Brian Deese.
</p><p>
	From 2021 to 2023, Deese led the National Economic Council at the White House, serving as President Joe Biden’s top economic aide during such events as the post-pandemic recovery, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act.
</p><p>
	Before that, Deese was global head of sustainable investing for Blackrock and a senior political advisor to President Barack Obama. He’s now the Institute Innovation Fellow at MIT, where he helps lead the Clean Investment Monitor, a project that tracks investment in climate technology and infrastructure across the U.S. economy.
</p><p>

</p></center><p>Here is an excerpt from our conversation:</p><blockquote><strong>Robinson Meyer:</strong> I want to start by talking about the State of the Union. Jesse, I feel like you had a stronger response to the State of the Union than I did. Where I saw it and I was like, yes, the president is talking about the IRA, he's talking about big climate legislation, primarily in a jobs context. I feel like you were maybe more surprised.<br/><br/>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>What I was kind of expecting was Biden to lean in a bit more on the manufacturing Renaissance story. And he referenced it a couple times as sort of the high level numbers, which we can come back to, which probably came from your Clean Investment Monitor project, if I'm not mistaken. And he told the story of the Belvedere plant that was saved from bankruptcy through the UAW negotiations and is now being rebuilt as a EV manufacturing facility. But I was expecting him to say something more broadly about how we have been talking about bringing manufacturing jobs back to America for my entire lifetime, right, for decades.<br/>
<br/>
	And the previous president, of course, also made lots of promises about trying to support US manufacturing. And then of course, did basically nothing to do that. And Biden has an incredible track record on that front, an enormous amount of investment happening across multiple sectors, and in particular in the clean energy domain.<br/> And maybe this is just the limits of a State of the Union address where you got to touch a lot of different issues. But I kind of expected him to lean into that a little bit more and to make it clear that it wasn't just this one plant, that there are dozens of stories like Belvedere out there across the economy that are being fueled specifically by the Inflation Reduction Act, which by the way, he did never really mention by name.<br/>
<br/>
	So I was curious how you saw it and if you thought he had the right balance or maybe could have leaned in more or could do so in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Brian Deese: </strong>Well, I think one of the things about State of the Unions is that its quality and moments are often more important than quantity. And so I think that may be a little bit of what's going on.<br/>
<br/>
	But let me step back. Look, I think it was an excellent speech and I think it was delivered in an even more excellent way. And at the top line, the speech was designed to drive pace and clear contrast.<br/>
<br/>
	It's interesting that some of the reaction has been partisan. But if you actually go through the speech, it's really clear-eyed contrast. And a lot of the things where the contrast exists are between, as the president said multiple times, his predecessor and the vast majority of the American people. And that's smart.<br/>
<br/>
	And the pace was evident from the get-go and positioned President Biden to do exactly what he wanted to do, was to get in the chamber at the podium and go at this thing and demonstrate his capability, but also his enthusiasm. I think for people who actually watched it on TV, you saw not only a president who was in command, but who was having a lot of fun. And a lot of fun because I think he believed in what he was doing.<br/>
<br/>
	So that's the most important. And when you're structuring a speech like this, you want to say, if that's your goal is to try to have clear contrast and pace, how do you keep that going? I think in some ways the most important line which goes, Jesse, to the point you are making is he said something to the effect of, it doesn't make the news, it doesn't make the headlines, but in thousands of cities across America, people are writing the greatest comeback story never told.<br/>
<br/>
	And I would anticipate that in that idea, in thousands of cities and towns across America, greatest comeback story never told will be a consistent refrain and a throughline to try to get at exactly your point, which is there's an element of that, which reflects a little bit of immediate criticism, right? The greatest comeback story never told, which is why do we never hear about these things going on again?<br/>
<br/>
	But it also reflects the kind of great American story that these comeback stories are in fact happening. And for the people and the communities themselves, it matters.<br/>
<br/>
	And look, I think that that's where Belvedere fit in, which is oftentimes the best way to try to bring to life that idea is not by trying to describe or animate all of the ways in which it's happening across the country and people like the three of us get very gripped by the overarching statistics.<br/>
<br/>
	But the story and the story of Belvedere was one that if you look across the speech, there aren't that many moments where you can actually tell a story like that. And so there was a clear decision to say, this is a story and we are going to tell the story about clean energy manufacturing through the lens of a place and a community, which is really about jobs and grit and resilience. And for those who weren't paying line by line attention to the story of Belvedere, is Belvedere, Illinois, home of a storied Chrysler plant that was initiated in 1965 I'll continue to refer to Stellantis as Chrysler because I still can't get over the idea that we're not still referring it to as that name, but was basically for a whole bunch of reasons an auto plant that was on its back and then was closed and for a variety of reasons, including the strength of UAW's negotiating posture, but also the prospect of bringing battery manufacturing here to the U.S., Belvedere has gone from, you know, is really a Phoenix rising story in a pretty concrete way.<br/>
<br/>
	So my takeaway from Jesse, your surprise, is that in fact, what the president did was provide a frame for going out and telling that great comeback story and going and telling it. And in fact, the way to tell it will actually be in individual stories in most cases.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah, I think that makes sense. I guess what I was thinking was there'd be an opportunity to draw a sharper contrast, which would be pretty consistent with the rest of the speech between President Biden and his quote unquote predecessor. In the sense that really, I mean, we, we've been literally politicians have been promising to bring manufacturing back since the 70s and 80s, right.<br/>
<br/>
	And now we are seeing that investment really thanks to a whole suite of policies, some of them bipartisan, like CHIPS and Science, and some of them, you know, I think with broad support in the American public, like you're saying, Brian, even if the partisan nature of the congressional debate right now, you know, makes it seem more partisan than it is, it's, you know, these are broadly popular policies. So it was kind of expecting a little bit more contrast there.</blockquote><div class="horizontal-rule">

## Berkeley to Return Parking Lot on Sacred Site to Ohlone Tribe

date: 2024-03-13, from: VOA News USA

SAN FRANCISCO — A San Francisco Bay Area parking lot that sits on top of a sacred tribal shell mound dating back 5,700 years has been returned to the Ohlone people by the Berkeley City Council after a settlement with developers who own the land.


Berkeley's City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to adopt an ordinance giving the title of the land to the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust, a women-led, San Francisco Bay Area collective that works to return land to Indigenous people and that raised the funds needed to reach the agreement. 


“This was a long, long effort but it was honestly worth it because what we’re doing today is righting past wrongs and returning stolen land to the people who once lived on it," said Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin. 


The nearly 1-hectare parking lot is the only undeveloped portion of the West Berkeley shell mound, a three-block area Berkeley designated as a landmark in 2000. 


Before Spanish colonizers arrived in the region, that area held a village and a massive shell mound with a height of 6 meters and the length and width of a football field that was a ceremonial and burial site. Built over years with mussel, clam and oyster shells, human remains, and artifacts, the mound also served as a lookout. 




The Spanish removed the Ohlone from their villages and forced them into labor at local missions. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Anglo settlers took over the land and razed the shell mound to line roadbeds in Berkeley with shells.


“It's a very sad and shameful history,” said Berkeley City Councilmember Sophie Hahn, who spearheaded the effort to return the land to the Ohlone. 


“This was the site of a thriving village going back at least 5,700 years and there are still Ohlone people among us and their connection to this site is very, very deep and very real, and this is what we are honoring,” she added. 


The agreement with Berkeley-based Ruegg & Ellsworth LLC, which owns the parking lot, comes after a six-year legal fight that started in 2018 when the developer sued the city after officials denied its application to build a 260-unit apartment building with 50% affordable housing and along with retail and parking space. 


The settlement was reached after Ruegg & Ellsworth agreed to accept $27 million to settle all outstanding claims and to turn the property over to Berkeley. The Sogorea Te’ Land Trust contributed $25.5 million and Berkeley paid $1.5 million, officials said.

 

The trust plans to build a commemorative park with a new shell mound and a cultural center to house some of the pottery, jewelry, baskets and other artifacts found over the years and that are in the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley. 


Corrina Gould, co-founder of the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust, addressed council members before they voted, saying their vote was the culmination of the work of thousands of people over many years. 


The mound that once stood there was “a place where we first said goodbye to someone,” she said. “To have this place saved forever, I am beyond words.”


Gould, who is also tribal chair of the Confederated Villages of Lisjan Ohlone, attended the meeting via video conference and wiped away tears after Berkeley’s City Council voted to return the land.

## Classified Document Hearing Shows Stiff Partisan Divides on Biden's Responsibility, Memory

date: 2024-03-13, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Members of Congress on Tuesday turned a hearing about President Joe Biden's handling of classified documents into a charged referendum on a question central to the upcoming presidential election: the 81-year-old's mental fitness. 


The Biden administration and their main challengers, the backers of presumptive Republican candidate Donald Trump, emerged from the House Judiciary Committee's five-hour grilling of Special Counsel Robert Hur with radically different answers to that question.


They also starkly disagreed over Hur's decision not to file criminal charges, despite concluding in his February report that Biden "willfully retained and disclosed classified materials as a private citizen."


Criminal charges were not warranted, Hur argued in announcing his decision in early February, because, he said, Biden would likely present himself to a jury as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory" — words that Republican legislators repeated, repeatedly, during the hearing. 


Afterward, Ian Sams, spokesperson for the White House counsel's office, gave his take:


"The main thing I took away from the hearing today was that we had three hours of the Republicans showing just how hypocritical they're willing to be in order to politically attack the president at the same time that they and the Democrats and the special counsel himself laid bare exactly why there is no case here," he said.


"The case is closed, the evidence did not support bringing charges, and it's over," Sams said. "It's time to move on."


Alex Pfeiffer, a spokesperson for Trump's Make America Great Again movement, offered his own conclusion.


"Joe Biden put America's national security at risk with his illegal retention and disclosure of classified material," he said. "Biden lied about his wrongdoing in a national press conference, which begs the question — what else is Joe Biden lying about?" 


Further muddying the picture on the matter is Hur's own grammatically complex statement: 


"The word exoneration does not appear anywhere in my report and that is not my conclusion," Hur said. 


A newly released transcript of Hur's five-hour interview held last year with Biden, includes instances of Biden saying he couldn't recall details or citing dates incorrectly, appearing to say in one instance that his eldest son died in 2017 and that Trump, who was elected in 2016, was "elected in November of 2017."


"The transcript is now available for every American to see, for all media to see," Sams said. He noted it shows that, despite the confusion over the year of Beau Biden's death, it shows that Biden correctly cited the date: May 30. 


"I think that you saw the anger and emotional reaction of a father who still experiences the pain of that loss every single day," Sams said. 


Many Republicans used their five-minute question periods to compare Biden's situation to that of his challenger. Trump, too, faces criminal charges over his handling of classified documents after he left office. He was initially slapped with 37 felony counts, including charges that he obstructed justice by failing to return the documents even in response to a subpoena. It's not clear when that case will go to trial. 


Florida Representative Matt Gaetz, in one sentence, took aim at the justice system and Biden's mental acuity: "This guy's not getting treated the same way as Trump, because the elevator is not going to the top floor, so we can't prove intent."


Democrats resisted that characterization. 


"Joe Biden is a competent, good president who knows American values," Tennessee Representative Steve Cohen said.


Hur, in his opening statement, said he would "refrain from speculating or commenting on areas outside the scope of the investigation."


But he also responded to criticism that he overstepped, saying he could not have reached the conclusion he did "without assessing the president's state of mind."


Other elected representatives chose not to ask Hur any questions, such as Missouri Representative Cori Bush, a Democrat, who described Hur's report as a "partisan hit job" — though she said it was appropriate for both Trump and Biden to be investigated. 


"Our country deserves better than this," she said of the hearing. 


Texas Representative Nathaniel Moran praised Hur's efforts, asking him only yes-or-no questions and suggesting Biden could be ruled incompetent by a District of Columbia court and placed under guardianship. And he repeated the critical line from Hur's report — words sure to echo over November's presidential contest — although he prefaced it with an adjective, calling Biden a "sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory."

Can't tell you how many times, as a developer, I wanted this. To get it going it'll need at least a couple of compelling apps, to seed the bootstrap. Like <a href="http://scripting.com/2013/01/24/whatAboutMacwriteAndMacpaint.html">MacWrite and MacPaint</a> for the Mac. Without that, it can't even begin. I could help with their bootstrap if I had some belief they had would not crush developers, which is harder to do than it sounds. The only times it has worked for me, for a little while, was when I created the platform and apps and content (you need all three). But the huge companies have no vision for the role of developers, so these things rarely even get off the ground, and who's going to sign up to believe in the goodness of a huge company. It's a very steep road TBL has chosen to travel. I have argued with my friends at Automattic that they are in a golden position to do this since they already have a large installed base product that's popular with users, and lots of developers who could make good use of storage attached to each account. I hope someone with deep pockets and longevity does it. Then we can really start building an app ecosystem on the net. We've been doing this for 35 years as TBL points out, and we still haven't created an economic developer ecosystem on the web. Storage, believe it or not, is the big missing piece.

## Subject codes, incomplete and unreliable, have got to go

date: 2024-03-13, from: Crossref Blog

<p>Subject classifications have been available via the REST API for many years but have not been complete or reliable from the start and will soon be deprecated.</p>
<p>The <code>subject</code> metadata element was born out of a Labs experiment intended to enrich the metadata returned via Crossref Metadata Search with All Subject Journal Classification codes from Scopus. This feature was developed when the REST API was still fairly new, and we now recognize that the initial implementation worked its way into the service prematurely.</p>
<p>While subject classifications in Crossref metadata could be very useful, the current implementation in the REST API is problematic for three primary reasons:</p>
<p><strong>They are misleadingly exposed in the API as a property of the work,</strong> when in fact they are a property of the container (e.g. a journal or conference proceeding). Just because a journal’s broad topic category is “X” doesn’t mean that a particular article in the journal is about “X.”</p>
<p><strong>Existing works may have outdated subjects.</strong> Originally, subject codes were not updated periodically. However, subjects exposed in the /journals route are now updated once a day. Those exposed via the /works endpoint are indexed along with works, and so when a new subject list is ingested, new DOIs start getting new subjects, but existing works may have outdated subjects. We don’t have a mechanism for forcing updates when incorrect subject values are returned via the REST API, so this data can be stale and incorrect.</p>
<p><strong>They are not applied to everything.</strong> This is because the Scopus list does not cover all the journals that Crossref has (conversely, the Scopus list contains some journals Crossref does not have), and does not contain other container types.</p>
<p>The Labs team investigated options for improving subject classification coverage but ultimately concluded that there are insufficient solutions to the coverage problem. For more, please see Esha Datta’s findings published at Force11’s Upstream: <a href="https://doi.org/10.54900/n6dnt-xpq48" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.54900/n6dnt-xpq48</a></p>
<p>Where does that leave us? Rather than continuing to supply unreliable and misleading subject category metadata, we will be deprecating this feature in the coming weeks. To minimize disruption and avoid breaking changes at this time, we will be removing this data from our index, so the subject element will simply be empty. We may remove the <code>subject</code> element in the future.</p>
<p>We know that the community’s desire for subject-based analysis of metadata is very strong, and we have supported efforts to establish a multidisciplinary taxonomy. Inaccurate codes in the meantime do not help but actually hinder these efforts, giving the false impression that they are correct.</p>
<p>We aim to deprecate the subject codes in April of this year.</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns by leaving a comment below, which will start a thread in our community forum.</p>
<p><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong></p>
<p>Q. Will the subject field continue to be available and functional?<br>
A. The subject metadata element will continue to be included in the JSON response but will not return any values.</p>
<p>Q. Will new subject codes be added in the future?<br>
A. We do not have any current plans to add new subject codes in the future.</p>
<p>Q. I received a notification about this, but we don’t use subject codes. Do I need to do anything?<br>
A. No, if you do not currently use the <code>subject</code> element, you do not need to do anything about this change.</p>
<p>Q. I noticed that wrong or inaccurate subject codes were assigned to my works. Is this a solution?<br>
A. Yes. Until we can identify an accurate and sustainable system for assigning subject codes to Crossref metadata records, we want to stop assigning inaccurate subject codes and remove all existing assignments.</p>

## Analysis: Does North Korea's Kim Want Another Summit With Trump?

date: 2024-03-12, from: VOA News USA

washington  — A re-elected U.S. President Donald Trump could well awaken the following day to a phone call inviting him to Pyongyang for a summit with Kim Jong Un, says a veteran of the two previous Trump-Kim summits in 2018 and 2019.


"If I were Kim Jong Un talking to my advisers in Pyongyang, I'd be thinking of whether I [should] call President-elect Trump the day after the election to congratulate him" and say, "Why don't you come to Pyongyang? Let's meet here," says former Trump adviser John Bolton.


"And Trump might do it," continued Bolton in an interview with VOA's Korean Service on Friday.


Bolton served as national security adviser during the period in which Trump and Kim exchanged frequent letters and conducted summits in Singapore in June 2018 and Hanoi in February 2019, as well as an impromptu meeting at the inter-Korean border in June 2019.


The Hanoi summit broke down when Trump walked away from Kim's offer to dismantle North Korea's main nuclear plant at Yongbyon in exchange for sanctions relief, and Kim has refused to engage with the United States or South Korea since U.S.-North Korean talks broke down in Stockholm eight months later.




But Bolton said that does not rule out the possibility that Kim might try again, or that Trump might accept.


"The danger with another Trump administration is he prizes making deals more than the substance of the deals, which he often doesn't understand in the international context," said Bolton, who has frequently criticized the former president’s approach to foreign affairs since leaving his administration.


Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration, told VOA via phone on Friday, "Kim Jong Un may very well believe that if there's another summit, he can persuade Trump to lift international economic sanctions" and "weaken the U.S.-ROK [South Korea] alliance as Trump did in the Singapore meeting."


At a news conference following his 2018 summit with Kim in Singapore, Trump announced the U.S. would suspend military drills with South Korea, describing them as "very provocative" and "tremendously expensive."




Joint exercises resumed, however, under Trump’s successor, President Joe Biden. The U.S. and South Korea are currently holding the annual Freedom Shield exercise. It began on March 4 and will continue through Thursday.


Harry Kazianis, a senior editor at the website 19FortyFive and president of the Rogue States Project, thinks another Trump-Kim summit would be unlikely.


"Right now, North Korea is likely getting billions of dollars a year from Russia to help Putin arm his military in the Ukraine war and likely little sanctions enforcement from China. If those conditions were to hold, Kim has very little to gain from dealing with Trump," he said.


But, he told VOA via email on Friday, Kim might need to engage with the American leader again if Trump were to bring the war in Ukraine to an end and successfully pressure China to enforce sanctions.


Scott Snyder, director of the program on U.S.-Korea policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, said via email on Friday that Pyongyang has made clear it is not interested in talks.


For diplomacy to resume, he said "both sides would have to find a way of putting the Hanoi experience behind them and establishing a new modus vivendi and mutually beneficial rationales for pursuing a new relationship."

## Knitting a Fuzzy Record of Climate Change

date: 2024-03-12, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTU0MDM4Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1OTI5Nzg3Mn0.Y0WsWpLYXeYvT0f2PcSYNJ_yyTMKujYIPgBArz3uDnQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Trina Messer knew the weather in Dallas-Forth Worth had been unusually warm this year, but she hadn’t anticipated needing her clay-colored yarn in <em>February</em>. “Today we are expecting a high in the 90s!!!,” she marveled in a Facebook update last week, adding regretfully, “I was hoping for more blues, but it is what it is.”
</p><p>
	Messer, a retired educator of 30 years, started crocheting in 2022, the natural evolution of a knitting habit she’d picked up while bored during the pandemic. So far, she has made several scarves and hats, a big cardigan “almost like a coat,” and even a couple of throw blankets. Then, in January, she began work on her biggest project yet: a <a href="https://tlycblog.com/unraveling-the-mystery-of-temperature-blankets/" target="_blank">temperature blanket</a>.
</p><p>
	Temperature blankets aren’t always blankets — they can be scarves, shawls, and even <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/272448773170943/posts/1966032640479206/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">crocheted snakes</a>. The basic premise, though, is the same: Over the course of a year, knitters, crocheters, and embroiderers add a new row, stitch, or square to their project every day, with the color of yarn corresponding to the temperature of the location where they live. In recent years, this community has grown massive, in essence creating a de facto visual record of climate change for thousands of locations around the world. “From December 1 until today, I’ve had over 26,000 people join,” Sarah Moerdyk, the creator and moderator of Facebook’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/272448773170943" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">largest temperature blanket group</a>, told me in February. For most of its existence, beginning in 2017, the group wasn’t “super active,” hovering around a few hundred members. “In a matter of three months, it’s really blown up.”
</p><p>
	Messer chose to break her earth-toned palette into 10-degree intervals, ranging from a white yarn that represents temperatures below 19 degrees Fahrenheit to “chili red” for days over 110. She even has a special yarn, “silver sparkle,” to log days with snowfall. Thankfully, she’d already purchased the clay-colored yarn she’d designated for temperatures between 90 and 99 degrees, even though she hadn’t expected to need it until late March or April.
</p><p>
	According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the contiguous United States just concluded its <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news/us-had-its-warmest-winter-on-record" target="_blank">warmest meteorological winter</a> in recorded history. Across the country, temperatures were 5.4 degrees above average; in some states, like Wisconsin, it was <a href="https://twitter.com/WI_ClimateSCO/status/1766162839440412870?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1766162839440412870%7Ctwgr%5E7637fff32a19e7b1d6a1fe8a7ddd66e528fec531%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jsonline.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2F2024%2F03%2F12%2Fwinter-2023-24-was-wisconsins-warmest-winter-ever-thanks-to-el-nino%2F72931642007%2F" target="_blank">nearly 10 degrees above</a> what it should have been for the period between December and February. “This is not normal,” Messer told me a couple weeks ago, when her phone showed it was 91 degrees near Dallas. “Don’t think it’s like this all the time.”
</p><p>
	Despite temperature blankets’ resemblance to climatologist Ed Hawkins’ famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warming_stripes#/media/File:20181204_Warming_stripes_(global,_WMO,_1850-2018)_-_Climate_Lab_Book_(Ed_Hawkins).svg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warming stripes</a>, the concept predates his 2018 graphics. Perhaps more surprisingly, it wasn’t initially conceived as a commentary on climate change. As far as I — <a href="https://undergroundcrafter.com/2013/01/23/my-2013-temperature-scarf-pattern/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and others</a> — have been able to gather, Kristen Cooper, a craftsperson and beekeeper living in northern British Columbia, was the first to come up with the concept that evolved into the modern temperature blanket challenge when she described a similar scarf pattern in <a href="https://400squareftliving.blogspot.com/2013/01/knitting-my-year-in-temperatures-scarf.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a 2013 blog post</a>. “You record the day’s highest temperature by knitting one row in the color designated for each temperature,” she wrote. By the end of the year, “you will have a visual, colorful graph of the temperatures of your area.”
</p><p>
	Cooper told me she, in turn, had been inspired by knitter and author Lea Redmond’s “<a href="https://leafcutterdesigns.com/projects/knit-the-sky/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sky scarf</a>,” a project from 2008 (and later, <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/storey/craft-project-knit-sky-scarf/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a book</a>) that involved knitting a row a day in a color that “best captures the essence of the sky out your window.” Redmond was slightly skeptical of the idea that she could be the temperature blanket’s progenitor. Her project tried to capture “the embodied experience of looking at this beauty of the sky every day,” she told me. Temperature projects, by contrast, rely on numbers that people retrieve from a thermometer in their kitchen — or, “I’m guessing, a lot of people just check the internet.”

</p><p>
	Internet data doesn’t have the immediacy of events unfolding in real-time, outside your window. But representing temperature data at all requires a level of emotional remove that Redmond, personally, was a little wary of: For example, when wildfires turned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Skies_Day" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">day to night in California in 2020</a>, “temperature-wise, that would not have shown up in a temperature scarf, but in a sky scarf, that stripe would have looked like shit.”
</p><p>
	Cooper, for her part, never finished the first temperature scarf because she realized that if she missed a day, she couldn’t accurately make it up — her rural town didn’t have its own weather station — which would defeat the whole point of the project. But while she eventually moved on, swept up by life with a new baby, the knitting world took the concept and ran with it. “I hadn’t really been following along, but every now and then, a completely random post by strangers on Facebook or Instagram will pop up showing a temperature blanket,” Cooper told me. “And I’m always so amazed at how far the concept has traveled.”
</p><p>
	Only recently have artists started using conceptual knitting and crocheting projects as explicit commentaries on climate change. In 2017, after the inauguration of President Trump, yarn shop owner Emily McNeil and data scientist Asy Connelly launched <a href="https://www.tempestryproject.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Tempestry Project</a> — which uses standardized colors and ranges to create historic temperature records — half as a joke and half out of real anxiety over the possibility of climate information <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22313763/scientists-climate-change-data-rescue-donald-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">disappearing from government websites</a>. “We weren’t really thinking about temperature blankets,” McNeil told me. “I guess I knew that they existed, but it wasn’t really on my radar when we started it.”
</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image image-crop-custom">

Photographed by the museum.</small>
</p><p>
	Admittedly, sifting through all that climate data can take an emotional toll during the hours or days it takes to complete a tapestry. In addition to tapestries representing individual years, which rely on historical data rather than real-time observations, the Tempestry Project also facilitates multi-year <a href="https://x.com/TempestryProj/status/1486313675841585152?s=20" target="_blank">“New Normal” tapestries</a> that are directly inspired by Hawkins’ warming stripes. “The first one that I knit had me in tears as the colder colors just fade out, and you are never going to get those again,” McNeil said. (When I asked how they deal with the feelings brought up by the project, McNeil and Connelly told me dryly, “A lot of wine.”)
</p><p>
	Temperature blanket knitters and crocheters can similarly feel alarmed by what’s unfolding in their hands. Moerdyk told me the warm weather in the northern hemisphere has been a big topic in the Facebook group, with some people having to quick-order summer colors or make special trips to the store to accommodate the winter heat in their projects. Perversely, the weirdness becomes kind of thrilling. “It’s fun to hear people say, ‘My colors are going nuts right now,’” Moerdyk said. Especially this early in the year, “to put all of a sudden this really warm temperature color in — it’s memorable. You’ll look back and say, ‘Oh my gosh, remember that time in February we had a 70-degree day? That was crazy.’”
</p><p>
	The result is that temperature blankets become an accessible way of discussing climate change, without any of the <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/nikki-haley-ron-desantis-fracking-environmentalist-gop-debate" target="_self">political baggage</a>. Moerdyk originally started the Facebook group for her friends but has since recorded participants from 1,114 different locations, including every state and over a dozen countries. She said the community has remained surprisingly civil despite all that diversity — some of it surely ideological. But temperature blankets are “not really a controversial topic,” Moerdyk said. “No matter what you believe in, temperature changes.”

</p><p>
	For the thousands of hobbyists who’ve taken on <a href="https://www.lovecrafts.com/en-us/c/article/temperature-blanket-climate-blanket" target="_blank">temperature blanket projects</a>, the craft becomes a way to witness the immediate changes in their environment that aren’t necessarily wholly negative. “If you’re looking at temperature blankets as a climate marker, that can get heavy,” Heather Walpole, the owner of <a href="https://eweewe.com/products/temperature-blanket-yarn-kit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ewe Ewe Yarns</a>, which sells temperature blanket starter bundles, told me. “But we’re still living our lives and we have a desire to create.”
</p><p>
	Redmond, the sky scarf creator, finds this kind of creative intentionality to be the key. “It’s not like I invented stripes having meaning,” she joked. “But I do think most stripes on most garments in most stores in the United States today are meaningless. That just seems like such a missed opportunity.” It’s not that having a throw blanket or a scarf with weather-coordinated stripes will change the world. But displaying or wearing a beautiful object inspires others to ask questions: <em>Where did you get that? Did you make it yourself? </em>“They’re story sparks,” Redmond said. “They’re excuses to tell your story.”
</p><p>
	This already weirdly warm year is still in its relatively chilly opening chapters, but the savviest knitters are already hurrying to stock up on yarns for June and July. As Messer, the Texas-based knitter, told me, “If this summer is anything like last summer,” then her blanket will have “a whole lot of burnt orange and red.”

## US Providing $300 Million in New Ukraine Military Aid

date: 2024-03-12, from: VOA News USA

pentagon  — The United States is providing a new round of military aid for Ukraine valued at up to $300 million, the first such announcement since late December, in what defense officials have called an “ad hoc” package made possible through U.S. Army procurement savings.


National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan announced the 55th presidential drawdown authority (PDA) package at the White House on Tuesday and said it would include artillery rounds and munitions for HIMARS, weapons desperately needed on the Ukrainian front lines where shortages abound.


“This ammunition will keep Ukrainians’ guns firing for a period, but only a short period,” Sullivan said.


Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder added that the package would provide Stinger anti-aircraft missiles along with anti-armor systems. He said the artillery rounds would include 155-mm dual purpose improved cluster munition rounds, which officials tell VOA the Army no longer uses.


The funding for this package came from savings garnered in “multiple contract actions over multiple months” where the Army was able to “buy things at a better price” than initially budgeted, according to senior defense officials who spoke to reporters on conditional of anonymity ahead of the White House announcement.




“This is a bit of an ad hoc or one-time shot. We don't know if or when future savings will come in, and we certainly can't count on this as a way of doing business,” one of the senior defense officials said.


In one example provided by the officials, the Army had initially estimated the cost of 25-mm rounds at $130 but was able to negotiate the price down to $93.


The savings were then placed back into the U.S. funding pot for Ukraine aid, a process that has happened several times but wasn’t considered as newsworthy during those times because the fund wasn’t “broke” before, according to defense officials.


$10 billion shortfall


The aid package comes despite a Pentagon funding shortfall of about $10 billion for U.S. military weapons needed to replace those already sent to Ukraine, a shortfall that requires additional money from Congress to fix, according to top defense officials.


“We don't foresee a likely alternative outside of the supplemental funding [bill] or having that money added into an appropriations bill in order to achieve the replenishment that we need,” Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks told reporters on Monday.


Pentagon officials expected to get the funding to replenish those stocks in a supplemental request from the Biden administration, which included billions of additional dollars in aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. However, Congress has yet to pass a supplemental aid bill because of arguments on spending and U.S. border security.


Because it has been 15 months since Congress last approved money to help Ukraine, defense officials say Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has expressed concerns about any future drawdowns.


The department still has about $4 billion in authority to send weapons to Ukraine, but there is no congressionally approved money left to replenish the Pentagon’s weapons stockpiles.


“We have the ability to move funds out of our stocks, but without the ability to replenish them, we are putting our own readiness at some risks,” according to one senior defense official.


The $10 billion shortfall is tied to the way the Pentagon has accounted for the aid sent to Ukraine. Last June, the Pentagon said it overestimated the value of weapons sent to Ukraine by about $6.2 billion over the past two years.


When calculating its aid package estimates, the Department of Defense was counting the cost incurred to replace the weapons given to Ukraine, while it said it should have been totaling the cost of the systems actually sent, officials told VOA at the time.


The error provided the Pentagon the legal cover needed to send more aid to Ukraine, but the problem remained that more funds would be needed to replenish U.S. military stockpiles with newer, costlier weapons.


Asked by VOA why the Pentagon was willing to use its savings to send more aid for Ukraine but was not willing to dip into the $4 billion of remaining presidential drawdown authority, one of the senior defense officials told reporters that “the lack of clarity” from Congress on whether they will approve additional aid makes the Pentagon “very reluctant to dig the hole deeper.”


“In this case, we are not digging the hole deeper. We're staying even, while recognizing that Ukraine is in a very tough spot this moment,” the defense official added.

We need a protocol for embedding a tweet in a web page. We used to have one with Twitter, but it now works only intermittently. Mastodon has one, and I have been able to use it. But really it would be nice to have a sort of jQuery of this stuff. If they're all going to create their own APIs we obviously need a container for that so developers don't have to worry about all of it.

## Biden Meets Polish Leaders Amid Anxiety Over US Support for Ukraine

date: 2024-03-12, from: VOA News USA

Washington — On the day that Poland commemorates 25 years as a member of NATO, President Joe Biden hosted Polish President Andrzej Duda and Prime Minister Donald Tusk at the White House amid anxiety over future U.S. funding to help Ukraine fend off Moscow’s invasion. 


“America's commitment to Poland is ironclad,” Biden told reporters Tuesday ahead of the meeting.


The meeting comes as the administration announced another security assistance package to Ukraine — $300 million of weapons and equipment. The funds come from “unanticipated cost savings” refunded to the Department of Defense, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said during a press briefing on Tuesday.


"It's not nearly enough," Biden said of the package, urging Republicans in the House of Representatives to pass the Senate-approved foreign aid package that includes $60 billion for Ukraine “before it's too late.”


“Russia's aggression against Ukraine” has demonstrated that the United States is “the security leader,” Duda said. He reiterated calls to fellow alliance members to boost their defense spending to 3% of their GDP to defend against Russia's aggression. 




Poland contributes 3.9% of its GDP to defense, almost twice the current NATO target of 2%, and the highest in percentage of GDP. The U.S. is the second-largest contributor by percentage, at 3.5% of GDP, but the largest within NATO in total dollar amount.


Duda’s proposal highlights the anxiety felt by Poland and other countries on NATO’s eastern flank that feel most threatened by Moscow’s aggression and comes as some in the western part of the alliance are pushing for a diplomatic resolution to the Ukraine war.


However, it’s aspirational and unlikely to be adopted anytime soon, as many within NATO have yet to meet even the 2% GDP target, said Michal Baranowski, managing director for GMF East, at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.


In an opinion piece Monday in The Washington Post, Duda highlighted Russia's alarming militarization, with Moscow earmarking nearly 30% of its annual budget for military spending. He underscored the threat posed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling it the most significant challenge to global peace since the Cold War era.


More US troops 


Duda, who under the Polish system represents the country in foreign affairs, and Tusk, the head of government in Poland, are bitter political rivals intensely locked in various domestic struggles but have vowed to speak with one voice on Ukraine, NATO and relations with Washington.


Warsaw advocates for more U.S. military presence in Poland, where approximately 10,000 U.S. personnel are on rotation. Washington is not keen on the idea, with Biden telling reporters Monday that there is “no need for more troops at the Polish border.”


Sullivan reinforced the message, saying the alliance is “postured well,” and that plans “to defend Poland, should it come to that, are strong.”


Sullivan said the U.S. will move forward with a new $2 billion Foreign Military Financing direct loan to Poland and will offer to sell Poland 96 Apache helicopters. Also Tuesday, the U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs notified Congress of their approval to sell more than $3 billion worth of missiles to Poland.




Meeting congressional leaders 


Earlier Tuesday, Duda and Tusk met with Democratic and Republican congressional leaders and advocated support for Ukraine. Duda said it is “a key element for containing Putin and Russia's imperial ambitions.”


Democrats and the White House are convinced the foreign aid package has the votes to pass in the House of Representatives, but Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has refused to bring it to the floor for a vote.


Having Polish leaders communicate to lawmakers the need for Washington to be a responsible ally is key, Baranowski told VOA, but it’s unlikely to be the final push that would break the logjam. Many House Republicans are allies of Donald Trump and support the former president’s opposition to providing foreign aid unless it’s structured as a loan.


Earlier this week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán told the Hungarian state news channel that Trump would not give “a penny” to support Ukraine, and “therefore, the war will end.” Orbán’s comments followed his meeting with Trump last week.


Asked for confirmation, the Trump campaign said a “top priority” in the former president’s “second term” will be “to quickly negotiate an end to the Russia-Ukraine war,” and that “European nations should be paying more of the cost of the conflict.”


“He will do what is necessary to restore peace and rebuild American strength and deterrence on the world stage, and he is the only person who can make that happen,” Steven Cheung, the campaign’s communications director, said in a statement to VOA.


Trump’s claims have further fueled European anxiety over U.S. commitment to the alliance, particularly if there’s a change in administrations following the American presidential election in November.


Last month, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said he'd “encourage” Russia “to do whatever the hell they want” if a NATO country didn't spend enough on defense. 




European officials have been increasingly concerned.


“We need to send this message to Russia collectively — the EU. and the U.S. — that there is no fatigue, and that we will support Ukraine to defend itself,” one European diplomat speaking on the condition of anonymity recently told VOA.


NATO summit 


According to the White House, the leaders will coordinate strategies ahead of the forthcoming NATO 75th Anniversary Summit in Washington in July. Warsaw wants to ensure that regional defense plans agreed to at the 2023 NATO summit in Vilnius are “not only well-planned, but actually resourced with troops to provide the level of deterrence and defense” needed on NATO’s eastern flank, Baranowski said. 


Reinforcing U.S.-Polish partnership in energy security is another main topic. Warsaw has earmarked $40 billion to build two nuclear plants. The first one is being built by Westinghouse, an American company.


It has been 25 years since a Polish president and prime minister visited Washington at the same time. In 1999, President Alexander Kwasniewski and Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek attended NATO’s 50th Anniversary Summit in the U.S. capital.


VOA national security correspondent Jeff Seldin and VOA chief national correspondent Steve Herman contributed to this report.

## Tech Today: Suspended Solar Panels See the Light

In the 80 years since the shocking collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in Washington, engineers have designed suspended structures to minimize their universal weakness: resonance. If not designed to deal with oscillations caused by forces like wind, the frequency of these forces would cause tensions to build and inevitably break the structure. When Jim [&#8230;]

## US House Passes Bill Forcing Chinese Company to Give Up TikTok

date: 2024-03-12, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. House of Representatives approved legislation Wednesday that would force the popular TikTok video app to either separate from its Chinese-owned parent company ByteDance or sell the U.S. version of the software.


The bipartisan Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act “gives TikTok six months to eliminate foreign adversary control — which would include ByteDance divesting its current ownership — to remain available in the United States,” said Representative Mike Gallagher, chairman of the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, and Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat on the committee.


“All TikTok would have to do is separate from CCP-controlled ByteDance. However, if TikTok chose not to rid itself of this CCP control, the application would no longer be offered in U.S. app stores. But TikTok would have no one but itself to blame,” the lawmakers said in a prepared statement.


Here's what we know about the legislation and what happens next in the U.S. Senate.


Why is TikTok under scrutiny?


“The concern is that TikTok could transfer personal information to its parent company ByteDance, who in turn could transfer it to the Chinese government,” Caitlin Chin-Rothmann, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told VOA.


Chin-Rothmann said concerns by some members of Congress about the Chinese Communist Party potentially controlling TikTok’s algorithm for propaganda purposes have not yet been proven.


“That's not to say that, in the future, there's not a risk that the Chinese government could exert pressure,” she said.


What does TikTok say about the legislation?


TikTok on Monday called the legislation a “ban” and has repeatedly denied the allegations against it. In a statement last week on X, formerly Twitter, the company said the “legislation has a predetermined outcome: a total ban of TikTok in the United States.”


How do lawmakers view the legislation?


The bill had strong support from House Democrats and Republicans, despite congressional offices receiving floods of phone calls from Americans concerned about losing access to the social media app.


House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters last week, “It's an important bipartisan measure to take on China, our largest geopolitical foe, which is actively undermining our economy and security.”


What about the Senate?


The bill could face a much harder road to passage in the Democratic-controlled Senate, where Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said it will face consideration in the appropriate committees.


“I will listen to their views on the bill and determine the best path,” Schumer said in a statement.


Some Senate Democrats, including Mark Warner, chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, have expressed doubts about the legality of singling out a social media app in legislation. He has introduced alternative legislation more broadly targeting apps that collect personal data.


But Warner told CBS News on Sunday that the TikTok app is a serious national security concern.


“If you don't think the Chinese Communist Party can twist that algorithm to make it the news that they see reflective of their views, then I don't think you appreciate the nature of the threat,” Warner said.


How do the leading 2024 presidential candidates feel about the bill?


The White House said it welcomes the legislation, even though the Biden campaign joined TikTok recently as an effort to reach out to younger voters.


White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters the bill ensures “ownership isn't in the hands of those who may do us harm.”


Former President Donald Trump — who initially called for a ban of the app in 2020 — has now changed course, arguing that Facebook will be empowered if TikTok is no longer available.


“There's a lot of good, and there's a lot of bad with TikTok. But the thing I don't like is that without TikTok, you're going to make Facebook bigger,” the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee told U.S. cable network CNBC in a phone interview this week.


What happens after the bill passes the House?


Apart from constitutional concerns over preventing U.S. citizens from exercising their right to free speech, the bill could also be difficult to legally enforce and face challenges in U.S. courts.


“Chinese export control laws could potentially prevent the sale of TikTok’s algorithm,” Chin-Rothmann said. “A divestiture would be very logistically difficult, in general. TikTok is one of the largest companies in the world. So, any buyer would have to be very large, as well. They would have to have a strategic interest in purchasing TikTok, and then the merger would have to not raise antitrust concerns in the United States.”

## US Prosecutor Defends Biden 'Poor Memory' Report to House Panel

date: 2024-03-12, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The U.S. prosecutor who sparked a political firestorm last month with a report saying President Joe Biden had a "poor memory" appeared before a congressional committee on Tuesday to defend his assessment.


Special Counsel Robert Hur arrived to speak to the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, which has been one of the panels conducting an impeachment inquiry into Biden, 81.


"My assessment in the report about the relevance of the President's memory was necessary and accurate and fair," Hur said in his prepared opening statement. "I did not sanitize my explanation. Nor did I disparage the President unfairly. I explained to the Attorney General my decision and the reasons for it. That's what I was required to do."


A transcript of Hur's interview with Biden reviewed by Reuters, conducted last October as Biden grappled with the fallout from Hamas's Oct. 7 assault on Israel, showed that the president brought up the issue of his memory first.


"I'm a young man, so it's not a problem," Biden, 81, said jokingly to Hur when the prosecutor said he'd be asking questions about events that happened years earlier, the transcript showed.


Hur appears in Congress the week after Biden made a fiery State of the Union speech that signaled an aggressive start to the Democratic president's reelection campaign, a rematch with Republican predecessor Donald Trump.


Hur's employment at the Justice Department ended on Monday, the department said.


His report said he would not seek charges against Biden for retaining classified documents after leaving office as vice president in 2017, but drew anger from the White House for its depiction of Biden.


"We have also considered that, at trial, Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory," the report said.


Biden, the oldest person to hold the office of the U.S. president in history, lashed out against the characterization in public remarks, saying his memory was fine, and Vice President Kamala Harris called the report politically motivated.


Trump, 77, is facing multiple criminal prosecutions, including one over his own mishandling of classified documents and is set to face off with Biden in November's presidential election.  


Trump and allies have accused the Justice Department of having a double standard, but prosecutors said Trump actively obstructed their search for the documents and did not cooperate with the investigation into them. Hur said Biden was generally cooperative with the probe.


Hur was appointed as a U.S. attorney by Trump and made special counsel by Biden's Attorney General Merrick Garland after Biden's documents surfaced.


House Republicans have requested underlying documents related to the probe, but have said the Justice Department has not complied.


House Republicans allege that Biden and his family improperly profited from policy decisions Biden participated in as vice president in 2009-17, though they have so far not released any evidence showing that Biden benefited financially. The White House has denied wrongdoing.


House Republicans have invited Biden's son Hunter Biden to a public hearing on March 20, but it is not clear whether the younger Biden will participate.

Their abstract claims that:<br />
<blockquote>
we increase the capacity of [optical data storage] to the petabit level by extending the planar recording architecture to three dimensions with hundreds of layers, meanwhile breaking the optical diffraction limit barrier of the recorded spots. We develop an optical recording medium based on a photoresist film doped with aggregation-induced emission dye, which can be optically stimulated by femtosecond laser beams. This film is highly transparent and uniform, and the aggregation-induced emission phenomenon provides the storage mechanism. It can also be inhibited by another deactivating beam, resulting in a recording spot with a super-resolution scale. This technology makes it possible to achieve exabit-level storage by stacking nanoscale disks into arrays, which is essential in big data centres with limited space.

The ODS has a capacity of up to 1.6 Pb for a DVD-sized disk area through the recording of 100 layers on both sides of our ultrathin single disk.

1.6 petabit is 200TB per disk, which is 2,000 times the capacity of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray">triple-level Blu-ray media</a>. So this is a big increase. But weirdly, the caption to their Figure 1 <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06980-y">claims that</a>:<br />

The capacity of a single 3D nanoscale disk is approximately equivalent to that of a petabit-level Blu-ray library (15.2 Pb, DA-BH7010, Hualu, China) or an HDD data array (12.64 Pb, EMC PowerVault ME5084, Dell, USA).
</blockquote>
A decade ago, <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">Facebook's Blu-ray library</a> put 10,000 100GB disks in a single rack for 1 Peta<i>byte</i> or 8 Peta<i>bit</i> capacity.  This is 5 times as much as the authors' claim for a single disk. The caption's claim of 15.2Pb for the DA-BH7010 is 9.5 times their claim of the capacity of a single disk. Note also that they compare the volume of a single disk to the volume of complete read-write systems, which is comparing apples to oranges. I guess if your meaning of "approximately" is "within an order of magnitude" that makes sense.<br />

I assume that because this transition involves polymerization it is irreversible, making the media write-once. Comparing the dark blue line (second state) with the yellow and pink lines (third state) in Figure 3c shows that the second and third states are readily distinguishable by their <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06980-y">emissions when illuminated by &gt;1mw 480nm</a>.<br />
<br />
There are a number of reasons to be less enthusiastic about the potential of this technology than Hossenfelder. It is true that they have demonstrated the ability to read and write petabit-scale data on a CD-sized medium. To do the reading they use two lasers, a 480nm pulsed and a 592nm continuous laser. To do the writing they used two lasers, a 515nm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_locking">femtosecond laser</a> and a 639nm continuous-wave laser. I haven't been able to find a price for a 515nm femtosecond laser, but <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=14348">here</a> is a 1550nm femtosecond laser for $48,880. The femtosecond laser they actually (<a href="https://www.acculasers.com/en/product/fs_lasers/">Acculasers ACL-AFS-515-CUS</a>) used is a substantial box with fans and an AC power input.<br />
<br />
The authors make claims of the density of the <i>medium</i> but not of the <i>system</i>. Clearly, current femtosecond lasers are too expensive and too large to use in equivalents of the decade-old <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">Facebook Blu-Ray technology</a>. Something like Microsoft Research's system that uses femtosecond lasers to write in Silica allows the cost of the lasers to be amortized over an entire data-center aisle of media. If you are going to build something like this, there is no reason to use the CD form factor.<br />
<br />
The repetition rate of the femtosecond laser was 42MHz. I believe it writes one bit per pulse, so the write bandwidth is limited to around 5MB/sec, meaning that writing an entire disk would take around 10.5 hours. A system using this technology would be write-once, and have a long read latency while the robot fetched the needed disk. It would thus only be suitable for the niche archival market, and in this market the slow write rate would require many drives writing in parallel. This all makes this claim by the authors <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06980-y">somewhat hyperbolic</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
the development of next-generation industry-oriented nanoscale ODS that is much less expensive than state-of-the-art optical disk libraries and HDD data arrays will fulfil the vast data storage requirements of the big-data era.
</blockquote>
It would have similar product issues to those I outlined in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/03/microsofts-archival-storage-research.html"><i> Microsoft's Archival Storage Research</i></a>:<br />

Six years on flash has finally impacted the bulk storage market, but it isn't predicted to ship as many bits as hard disks for another four years, when it will be a 40-year-old technology. Actual demonstrations of DNA storage are only 12 years old, and similar demonstrations of silica media are 15 years old. History suggests it will be decades before these technologies impact the storage market.<br />
</blockquote>
Hossenfelder makes several mistakes in her report:<br />
<ul>
<li>"new disk memory that could bring disk memory into the Petabyte range" - no, that is the Peta<i>bit</i> range.</li>
<li>Optical disks "were outcompeted by hard disks". - no, write-once removable media and on-line storage are two completely different markets. Optical disks lost out to the cloud and to a lesser extent by flash.</li>
<li>"the information density on compact disks or any optical storage is ultimately limited by the frequency of the laser light" - well yes, but she is talking about a paper describing a 2000-times increase in capacity <i>using laser light</i>.</li>
<li>"in modern flash drives the information is stored in little magnetizable cells that are a few atoms in size" - no, flash isn't a magnetic technology. She also misses that modern flash is a volumetric not a planar technology, just like the technology in the paper.</li>
<li>"figured out how to write data in multiple layers" - no, Blu-ray is a multi-layer technology more than a decade old. They figured out how to write a lot more layers of much smaller bits.</li>
<li>"this could work up to hundreds of layers" - well, they only demonstrated 100 layers, so hundreds plural is speculation. To get to the petabyte range needs at least 500 layers or much smaller bits. Note that modern flash has over 100 layers.</li>
</ul>

## Millennials will be worse off than their parents, right? Maybe not.

date: 2024-03-12, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>It&#8217;s practically accepted as truth at this point: Millennials would be the first generation to be worse off than their parents. But recent research casts some doubt on that assessment. We&#8217;ll consider some economic findings that reframe things a bit. Plus, prices were up 3.2% annually in February, and month-over-month price increases seem to be going in the wrong direction. That&#8217;s not something the Federal Reserve will be happy about.</p>

## Four Astronauts From Four Countries Return to Earth After Six Months in Orbit

date: 2024-03-12, from: VOA News USA

Cape Canaveral, Florida — Four astronauts from four countries caught a lift back to Earth with SpaceX on Tuesday to end a half-year mission at the International Space Station.


Their capsule streaked across the U.S. in the predawn darkness and splashed into the Gulf of Mexico near the Florida Panhandle.


NASA's Jasmin Moghbeli, a Marine helicopter pilot, led the returning crew of Denmark's Andreas Mogensen, Japan's Satoshi Furukawa and Russia's Konstantin Borisov.


They moved into the space station last August. Their replacements arrived last week in their own SpaceX capsule.




"We left you some peanut butter and tortillas," Moghbeli radioed after departing the orbiting complex on Monday. Replied NASA's Loral O'Hara: "I miss you guys already and thanks for that very generous gift."


O'Hara has another few weeks at the space station before leaving aboard a Russian Soyuz capsule.


Before leaving the space station, Mogensen said via X, formerly known as Twitter, that he couldn't wait to hear "birds singing in the trees" and also craved crunchy food.


NASA prefers multiple travel options in case of rocket trouble. Boeing should start providing astronaut taxi service with a two-pilot test flight in early May.

## Zero-Boil-Off Tank Experiments to Enable Long-Duration Space Exploration

date: 2024-03-12, from: NASA breaking news

Do we have enough fuel to get to our destination? This is probably one of the first questions that comes to mind whenever your family gets ready to embark on a road trip. If the trip is long, you will need to visit gas stations along your route to refuel during your travel. NASA is grappling with similar issues as it gets ready to embark on a sustainable mission back to the Moon and plans future missions to Mars.

## US Inflation Rises in February in Sign Price Pressures Remain Elevated

date: 2024-03-12, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Consumer prices in the United States picked up last month, a sign that inflation remains a persistent challenge for the Federal Reserve and for President Joe Biden's reelection campaign, both of which are counting on a steady easing of price pressures this year. 


Prices rose 0.4% from January to February, higher than the previous month's figure of 0.3%, the Labor Department said Tuesday. Compared with a year earlier, consumer prices rose 3.2% last month, faster than January's 3.1% annual pace. 


Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called "core" prices also climbed 0.4% from January to February, matching the previous month's increase and a faster pace than is consistent with the Fed's 2% target. Core inflation is watched especially closely because it typically provides a better read of where inflation is likely headed. 


Pricier gas pushed up overall inflation, with pump prices rising 3.8% just from January to February. Grocery prices, though, were unchanged last month and are up just 1% from a year earlier. The cost of clothing, used cars and rent also increased in February, raising the inflation figure. 


Despite February's elevated figures, most economists expect inflation to continue slowly declining this year. At the same time, the uptick last month may underscore the Fed's cautious approach toward interest rate cuts. 


Overall inflation has plummeted from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022, although it's now easing more slowly than it did last spring and summer. The prices of some goods — from appliances to furniture to used cars — are falling after clogged supply chains during the pandemic sent prices soaring higher. There are more new cars on dealer lots and electronics on store shelves. 


By contrast, prices for dental care, car repairs and other services are still rising faster than they did before the pandemic. Car insurance has shot higher, reflecting rising costs for repairs and replacement. And after having sharply raised pay for nurses and other in-demand staff, hospitals are passing their higher wage costs on to patients in the form of higher prices. 


Voter perceptions of inflation are sure to occupy a central place in this year's presidential election. Despite a healthy job market and a record-high stock market, polls show that many Americans blame Biden for the surge in consumer prices that began in 2021. Although inflationary pressures have significantly eased, average prices remain far above where they stood three years ago. 


In his State of the Union speech last week, Biden highlighted steps he has taken to reduce costs, like capping the price of insulin for Medicare patients. The president also criticized many large companies for engaging in "price gouging" and so-called "shrinkflation," in which a company shrinks the amount of product inside a package rather than raising the price. 


"Too many corporations raise prices to pad their profits, charging more and more for less and less," Biden said. 


Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled in congressional testimony last week that the central bank is getting closer to cutting rates. After meeting in January, Fed officials said in a statement that they needed "greater confidence" that inflation was steadily falling to their 2% target level. Since then, several of the Fed's policymakers have said they believe prices will keep declining. One reason, they suggested, is that consumers are increasingly pushing back against higher prices by seeking out cheaper alternatives. 


Most economists expect the Fed's first rate cut to occur in June, although May is also possible. When the Fed cuts its benchmark rate, over time it reduces borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, credit cards and business loans. 


One factor that could keep inflation elevated is the still-healthy economy. Although most economists had expected a recession to occur last year, hiring and growth were strong and remain healthy. The economy expanded 2.5% last year and could grow at about the same pace in the first three months of this year, according to the Federal Reserve's Atlanta branch. 


Last week, the Labor Department said employers added a robust 275,000 jobs in February, the latest in a streak of solid hiring gains, and the unemployment rate stayed below 4% for the 25th straight month. That is the longest such streak since the 1960s. 


Still, the unemployment rate rose from 3.7% to 3.9%, and wage growth slowed. Both trends could make the Fed feel more confident that the economy is cooling, which could help keep inflation falling and lead the central bank to begin cutting rates.

<strong></strong>President Biden proposed a $7.3 trillion budget yesterday, and his “climate and energy promises figured prominently,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=2ff7764c5d&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> <em>E&E News.</em> Biden requested $17.8 billion for the Interior Department to help with climate resilience, national parks, wildfire management, tribal programs, ecosystem restoration, and water infrastructure in the west. He wants $11 billion for the EPA and $51 billion for the Department of Energy to tackle climate change and help fund the energy transition. The proposal calls for funding toward expanding the “Climate Corps.” Biden also <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=3b34299ff9&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">asked</a> Congress to put $500 million into the international Green Climate Fund in 2025, and then more in the following years. And he wants to make this spending mandatory. The budget would also “cut wasteful subsidies to Big Oil and other special interests,” Biden said. As<em> Morning Brew</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=34555ba1b7&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a>, the budget proposal has “about as much chance of getting passed by Congress as a bill guaranteeing each American a pet unicorn, so it’s mostly a statement of Biden’s priorities.”

	2. U.S. EV prices drop 13% year-over-year
</h3><p>
<strong></strong>EV prices in the U.S. have dropped by about 13% in the last year, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=fb2056ebbc&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> Kelley Blue Book. The drop “has been led in part by the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y, the two most popular EVs in the U.S.,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=6b090f2665&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a> Michelle Lewis at <em>Electrek</em>. However, EVs are still more expensive than “mainstream non-luxury vehicles,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of Industry Insights at Cox Automotive.
</p><h3>
	3. Report: BYD struggles to ramp up overseas EV sales
</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Chinese EV maker BYD has reportedly hit a speed bump on the road to international expansion. Having dominated the Chinese market and established itself as the top-selling EV maker in the world, BYD set an internal goal of selling 400,000 cars overseas this year. But a global slowdown in EV sales growth has hampered that effort, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=50a9e2c998&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a><em> The Wall Street Journal</em>. “As of the end of last year, more than 10,000 BYD passenger cars were waiting in warehouses in Europe,” the <em>Journal</em> added, “and the certificates authorizing them to be sold in the European Union are set to expire soon, meaning it may not be possible to sell them in Europe.” At the same time, quality control issues have been cropping up in some vehicles, and higher prices in Europe are making it more difficult for the company to compete with better-known brands.
</p><h3>
	4. U.K. emissions hit 145-year low 
</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Greenhouse gas emissions in the UK fell last year to their lowest level since 1879, according to <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=abaf433330&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analysis</a> from <em>Carbon Brief</em>. The decline is attributed mainly to a drop in gas demand thanks to higher electricity imports and warmer temperatures. As recently as 2014, the power sector was the UK’s largest source of emissions, but now it has been eclipsed by transportation, buildings, industry, and agriculture. “Transport emissions have barely changed over the past several decades as more efficient cars have been offset by increased traffic,” <em>Carbon Brief </em>explained. Remarkably, coal use in the country is at its lowest level since the 1730s, “when George II was on the throne.” The emissions drop is good news but “with only one coal-fired power station remaining and the power sector overall now likely only the fifth-largest contributor to UK emissions, the country will need to start cutting into gas power and looking to other sectors” to meet net zero by 2050. Meanwhile, the British government today <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d1006ff025&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> a plan to build new gas plants.

## European Commission’s use of Microsoft 365 infringes data protection law for EU institutions and bodies

date: 2024-03-12, from: OS News

Following its investigation, the EDPS has found that the European Commission (Commission) has infringed several key data protection rules when using Microsoft 365. In its decision, the EDPS imposes corrective measures on the Commission. ↫ European Data Protection Supervisor You often hear people state that EU rules and regulations are designed exclusively to harm non-EU companies. The massive amounts of fines and corrective actions handed out to EU companies in all kinds of sectors already disprove this notion, and here&#8217;s a case where even the European Commission itself gets a slap on the wrist for violating its own rules and regulations &#8211; rules and regulations, we&#8217;re often told by especially American corporatists, are designed specifically to target poor American businesses. Not that corporatists have any use for reality and facts, but still.

## AI and the NYT

date: 2024-03-12, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Zach Seward, a friend from my days at <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/about/">Harvard</a> and NYU, got a kickass <a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/zach-seward-is-the-newsrooms-editorial-director-of-a-i-initiatives/">job</a>, starting up the AI effort at the NYT.  He's just the right guy for it. Young, curious, creative, and very ambitious. And he has a strong startup journalism background. I couldn't think of anyone I'd want more to be in this position. </p>
<p>Now that he's published <a href="https://www.zachseward.com/ai-news-thats-fit-to-print-sxsw-2024/?ref=zach-seward-newsletter">notes</a> for a talk he gave at SXSW, it's time to share some ideas I have for the NYT re AI.</p>
<ul>
<li>Current events. This is something ChatGPT doesn't do. Not sure why. I'd like to be able to connect to <a href="https://ai.nytimes.com/">ai.nytimes.com</a> and ask it to give me a rundown on the <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/03/09.html#a200615">lawyer</a> who's testifying in Congress today about how our president is "elderly." I don't want pointers to stories, though they should be included in the response, I want a custom report, like the ones ChatGPT provides, that answers the questions I have about the MAGA lawyer. Maybe the AI will just give me the story without the spin. </li>
<li>More useful NYT archives. When I was a kid I spent so much time at the <a href="https://www.queenslibrary.org/about-us/locations/central-library">big library</a> in Jamaica (Queens)  going back through microfilm of the NYT from before I was born. So far all we've done is replicate the microfilm user experience (which is great and very useful) but the thing that ChatGPT does so well is prepare custom reports. All that source material, used to answer very specific questions. Answer questions like "has anything notorious happened in the neighborhood I grew up in, as far as the NYT knows?"</li>
<li>Sell a service to your readers where you manage the archive of their blogs, and in doing so you create a much broader archive for historians, journalists and others to study in the future, and, in the context of AI, feed it all kinds of perspective on the time we live in. Maybe in the future history won't be written by the winners (lotsa luck with that). Anyway, if at some point the NYT and other journalism outlets will harness the energy, knowledge and intelligence of the readers, why not start now? </li>
</ul>
<p>I criticize the NYT a lot, I know. But that <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html">means</a> I care. When I stop criticizing you'll know that I've given up. </p>
<p>Alan Kay <a href="https://www.azquotes.com/quote/707961">said</a> of the Mac, it's the first personal computer worth criticizing. That's the spirit. </p>

## Wages have been outpacing inflation — but there’s a catch

date: 2024-03-12, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>While the purchasing power of earnings started to catch up to inflation last year, lower- and middle-income workers have been playing catch-up and are trying to dig out of debt. Meanwhile, Americans are working fewer hours on average, and fewer hours can cause total earnings to trail price gains.

date: 2024-03-12, updated: 2024-03-12, from: The Register (UK I.T. News)

<h4>If it has a GPU and NPU, plus VNNI and DP4a instructions, it qualifies. But it's <em>not</em> a brand like vPro or Ultrabook</h4> <p>If you're confused about what makes a PC an "AI PC," you're not alone. But finally have something of an answer: if it packs a GPU, a processor that boasts a neural processing unit and can handle VNNI and Dp4a instructions, it qualifies – at least according to Robert Hallock, Intel's senior director of technical marketing.…</p>

## Haiti’s leader resigns

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Haiti&#8217;s prime minister, Ariel Henry, has resigned after days of fierce fighting in the capital, Port-au-Prince. Heavily armed gangs have been roaming the streets there demanding his resignation. Then, India&#8217;s Supreme Court has told the country&#8217;s state bank to reveal the details of a scheme that allows political parties to receive anonymous donations. And later, as farmer protests continue across Europe, we look at what&#8217;s driving them.</p>

## 2024-02-28 Use of a calendar

date: 2024-03-12, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-02-28-use-of-a-calendar">2024-02-28 Use of a calendar</h1>

<p>In the last millennium, I used the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Diary.html">Emacs Diary</a> for my calendar. I mean, why not? The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Calendar_002fDiary.html">Emacs Calendar</a> is great. Better than the <code>cal</code> command-line utility, in any case. But eventually the world got mobile phones and I wanted an online calendar.</p>

<p>The example from the Emacs Diary documentation:</p>

<pre><code>12/22/2015  Twentieth wedding anniversary!
10/22       Ruth's birthday.
* 21, *:    Payday
Tuesday--weekly meeting with grad students at 10am
         Supowit, Shen, Bitner, and Kapoor to attend.
1/13/89     Friday the thirteenth!!
thu 4pm     squash game with Lloyd.
mar 16      Dad's birthday
April 15, 2016 Income tax due.
* 15        time cards due.
</code></pre>

<p>Back then, Google didn&rsquo;t want to be evil and I used Google Calendar.
When Google changed its mind, so did I.
I switched to <a href="2020-06-10_Radicale_for_Calendar_and_Contacts">Radicale</a>.</p>

<p>And yet, I sort of missed those diary file entries.</p>

<p>Today, <a class="account" href="https://social.tadzik.net/users/tadzik" title="@tadzik@social.tadzik.net">@tadzik</a> posted a link to <a href="https://codeberg.org/tadzik/caleb">caleb</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>caleb</code> will do its best to interpret a calendar event description, create a valid iCalendar event for it and optionally upload it to a CalDAV server.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nice!</p>

<p>Example usage, from the README:</p>

<pre><code>$ caleb friday 5pm beer
</code></pre>

<p>My main problem was that it took me a while to figure out what the correct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV">CalDAV</a> URL is. I looked into my iPhone accounts (my first mistake) and tried <code>https://example.org/radicale/alex</code>, then <code>https://example.org/radicale/alex/</code>, then <code>https://example.org/radicale/alex/Alex</code> – some of these URLs failed silently, some of them created new collections with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar</a> filename as the collection name… and I didn&rsquo;t get an warnings or error messages. I mean, it makes sense. It&rsquo;s like a filesystem, you can save whatever you want. But it&rsquo;s not what the calendar apps expect.</p>

<p>So, how do I discover the correct URL? Using a command-line <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV">WebDAV</a> explorer like <code>cadaver</code>. The following example shows how I log into Radicale and list the contents of the two directory I found. One of them is full of <code>.vcf</code> files (contacts), the other is full of <code>.ics</code> files (calendar entries). That&rsquo;s the one!</p>

## Housekeeping

                <p>Spring is almost here! Birds are chirping, days are getting longer. What a lovely time of the year. Housekeeping post to share a bunch of stuff with you all.</p>
<p><a href="https://heydingus.net/">Jarrod</a> managed to remove an item from my to-do list since he made a site for the <a href="https://oneamonth.club">One a Month Club</a>. I was planning to set up a page here on the site but I guess I don’t need to do that anymore. If you decide to join send him an email.</p>
<p><a href="https://chavanniclass.wordpress.com">Ratika</a> started <a href="https://kadambari.bearblog.dev/">Kadambari</a>, a book written online, chapter by chapter. Such a lovely idea, one <a href="https://ko-fi.com/ratikadeshpande">worth supporting</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://cagrimmett.com">Chuck</a> created a page for <a href="https://peopleandblogs.feedland.cloud">People and Blogs on FeedLand</a>. In there you’ll find:</p>
<ul>
<li>the interviews</li>
<li>posts from the blogs featured in the series</li>
<li>posts from all the blogs mentioned in the interviews</li>

Authoritarian prime minister Viktor Orb&#225;n of Hungary visited former president Trump in Florida on Friday, and on Sunday, Orb&#225;n assured Hungarian state media that Trump &#8220;will not give a penny in the Ukraine-Russia war. Therefore, the war will end, because it is obvious that Ukraine can not stand on its own feet.&#8221; Russian state media gloated at the news, and that Trump&#8217;s MAGA allies in Congress are already helping him end support for Ukraine.

## Intelligence Community Report Warns Lawmakers About US Disengagement From Ukraine

date: 2024-03-12, from: VOA News USA

In its annual global threats assessment report Monday, the U.S. intelligence community told lawmakers that the war in Ukraine is at a turning point whose outcome will depend on American assistance. VOA’s congressional correspondent Katherine Gypson has more from the Senate, where lawmakers called on the House to take up the $95 billion foreign aid bill.

## US Intelligence Chiefs Deliver Grim Warning on Ukraine

date: 2024-03-12, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The frozen military conflict between Ukraine and Russia is starting to thaw and will likely tilt in Moscow’s favor if the United States fails to quickly come through with additional military aid, according to top U.S. intelligence officials, in a grim assessment delivered to U.S. lawmakers.


Monday’s warning comes nearly a month after the U.S. Senate voted in favor of a stand-alone foreign aid bill that would send $60 billion in aid to Ukraine as it tries to hold on to territorial gains more than two years after Russian forces invaded.


But the lawmakers in the House of Representatives have refused to bring the bill up for a vote, leaving other Western nations scrambling to provide Ukraine with enough weapons and ammunition to hold off a renewed Russian offensive.


The $60 billion “is absolutely critical to Ukraine's defense right now,” Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told members of the Senate Intelligence Committee.




“Ukraine's retreat from Avdiivka and their struggle to stave off further territorial losses in the past few weeks have exposed the erosion of Ukraine's military capabilities with the declining availability of external military aid," she said. “Without that assistance, it is hard to imagine how Ukraine will be able to maintain the extremely hard-fought advances it has made against the Russians."


The director of the Central Intelligence Agency told lawmakers the war is at a crossroads, and that what happens next likely hinges on the provision of U.S. aid.


"The Ukrainians are not running out of courage and tenacity. They're running out of ammunition,” said the CIA’s William Burns. “And we're running out of time to help them."


Both Haines and Burns reiterated previous assessments: that up until now, Ukraine’s military has inflicted serious damage on Russia’s forces.


U.S. officials believe at least 315,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded, and that two-thirds of Russia’s prewar tank inventory has been destroyed. The Russian military, which had been undergoing a modernization program, has been set back years.


Russia’s invasion has also served to galvanize the West, with Sweden and Finland joining the NATO military alliance.


But Haines and Burns told lawmakers that none of those strategic defeats have managed to change the calculus of Russian President Vladimir Putin.


“Putin continues to judge that time is on his side,” Haines said, cautioning that the Russian leader is as entrenched as ever.


"He continues to see NATO enlargement and Western support for Ukraine as reinforcing his long-held belief that the United States and Europe seek to restrict Russian power and undermine him," she said, telling lawmakers that Putin’s response has been to push ahead with efforts to grow the Russian military, pouring more money into ammunition production and into the purchase of military supplies from Iran and North Korea.




U.S. intelligence officials also see signs Putin is continuing to move forward with plans to modernize and fortify Russia's nuclear weapons arsenal, already thought to be the largest and most diverse in the world.


And there are signs that Russia is willing to take chances to gain an advantage.


“We remain concerned that Moscow will put at risk long-standing global norms against the use of asymmetric or strategically destabilizing weapons, including in space and in the cyber domain," Haines said.




Some lawmakers echoed the concerns, urging colleagues to pass the legislation to get Ukraine the military supplies it needs.


“My fear is the decision thus far by the House of Representatives not to even take up legislation that would support Ukraine in the fight against Putin aggression has been one of the most short-sighted decisions on a national security issue that I can possibly imagine,” said Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner, a Democrat.


“The impact and long-term consequences of us abandoning Ukraine ... it's a 50-year mistake that would haunt this country,” added independent Senator Angus King.


And U.S. intelligence officials warned of a cascading global impact if the additional aid for Ukraine fails to materialize.


"The consequence of that will not just be for Ukraine or for European security but across the Indo-Pacific,” said the CIA’s Burns. “If we're seen to be walking away from Ukraine, not only is that going to feed doubts amongst our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific, it's going to stoke the ambitions of the Chinese leadership in contingencies ranging from Taiwan to the South China Sea."


The intelligence officials said while China remains wary, for now, it has been emboldened by Russia.


In particular, the intelligence officials said Russia was forced to grant China some long-sought concessions in exchange for support for Moscow’s war against Ukraine.


Iran and North Korea have likewise benefited, they said, warning the impact remains to be seen.


The changing dynamics have "the potential to undermine, among other things, long-held nonproliferation norms," Haines said.


But she added that while Russia, China, Iran and North Korea are growing closer, the prospects for a true alliance are, for now, remote.


“Parochial interests, a desire to avoid entanglements, and weariness of harm and instability from each other's actions will likely limit their cooperation … absent direct conflict between one of these countries and the United States,” Haines said.


Israel – Gaza


The U.S. intelligence officials also addressed concerns about the ongoing conflict in Gaza, where Israeli forces continue to pursue fighters of the Hamas terror group despite warnings from the United Nations and aid groups about the devastating impact on civilians.


"We're going to continue to work hard at this — I don't think anybody can guarantee success," the CIA’s Burns told lawmakers when asked about ongoing efforts to get a temporary cease-fire.


Burn recently traveled to the Middle East to meet with officials from Israel, Egypt and Qatar.


He said the deal currently under consideration would provide for the return of about 40 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas, most of them wounded or ill women or older men, in exchange for a six-week-long cease-fire that would allow the U.S. and its allies to surge in desperately needed aid.


“I understand Israel's need, and the president [Joe Biden] has emphasized this, to respond to the brutish attack that Israelis suffered on the 7th of October [by Hamas],” Burns told Republican Senator Tom Cotton.


“But I think we all also have to be mindful of the, you know, enormous toll that this has taken on innocent civilians in Gaza,” he added.


Gaza fallout


Haines further warned lawmakers that the crisis in Gaza has “galvanized violence by a range of actors,” and that it “is likely that the Gaza conflict will have a generational impact on terrorism."


But Haines said for now, Iran and its Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, appear reluctant to try to push too hard to manipulate the fighting for their benefit.


"We continue to assess that Hezbollah and Iran do not want to cause an escalation of the conflict that pulls us or them into a full-out war," she said.


Still, Haines acknowledged other Iranian-linked groups, like the Houthis in Yemen, have become “aggressive actors,” launching dozens of attacks on international shipping.

## Some things to consider when deciding whether to start building with "AI" in libraries and archives.

date: 2024-03-12, from: Ed Summers blog, Inkdroid

<p>
I was asked to participate in a panel at work about AI. I initially
declined, but once it became clear that I would be allowed to get on my
soapbox and rant for 15 minutes I agreed. Below are my notes and some <a
href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RyqenjG8PdIf9RH_evKI9HVl4PmQochmQMQXy2rm4_8/edit?usp=sharing">slides</a>.
This was not a fun post to write or present. I’m sure it rubbed some
people the wrong way, and I am genuinely sorry for that.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
I’ve done a little bit of work with AI, like downloading some models
from Hugging Face as part of named entity recognition <a
href="https://github.com/sul-dlss-labs/ksr-notebooks/blob/main/FE_Supporting_Links_NER_edsu.ipynb">experiments</a>,
running Whisper on some interviews that I wanted a transcript for, <a
href="https://inkdroid.org/2024/02/21/magic/">testing</a> out Google’s
new file identification tool, and writing a bot to use the OpenAI API to
generate some <a href="https://github.com/edsu/diary#readme">fake diary
entries</a> from some random words a friend of mine was publishing.
</p>
<p>
But as I listened to my CPU fan spinning, all this experience has really
done is reinforce some concerns I have as a software developer about the
AI industry, and the application of these technologies in libraries and
archives.
</p>
<p>
It’s not that I don’t think these tools and methods have some use in the
cultural heritage sector, but I do think we need to think carefully and
critically about them. I’m sure you will be familiar with at least a few
of these topics, but I thought it could be useful to bring them
together, with links to learn more, and also close each one out with
some tactics for addressing them.
</p>
<p>
If you take nothing else from this presentation I’d like it to be that
despite what the “boomers” and “doomers” would like you to believe, the
ascendency of AI is not inevitable, and we have decisions to make. What
we decide to do will have a big impact on how these technologies get
deployed.
</p>
<p>
Much of this perspective is informed by my own interest in Science and
Technology Studies, which encourages an understanding of technology in
its social and historical context, and to remember that “it could be
otherwise” <span class="citation" data-cites="Woolgar:2014">(<a
href="#ref-Woolgar:2014" role="doc-biblioref">Woolgar, 2014</a>)</span>.
It was also informed by reading Dan McQuillan’s book <a
href="https://bristoluniversitypress.co.uk/resisting-ai">Resisting
AI</a> (highly recommended).
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Despite the recent surge of interest in Large Language Models and
Generative AI tools (ChatGPT, DALL-E, etc), AI is part of long history
of computer automation, which is continuing to transform our work, and
our lives. I have tended to prefer the term <em>Machine Learning</em>
(ML) to <em>AI</em>, because it has more specificity when discussing the
recent application of statistical algorithms to increasingly large
datasets, using increasingly large computing environments. But I’ve also
come to appreciate that the term AI is actually useful for talking about
this longer trajectory of automation, stretching back to the beginnings
of modern computing. Looking at this technology as part of a very long
project, involving a shifting set of actors is important.
</p>
<p>
However the areas that I’m going to touch on here refer mostly to recent
developments with Large Language Models, although some of them are
relevant for more specialized forms machine learning as well. There are
five points of concern, and for each area I’ll include a <em>tactic</em>
for addressing it in libraries and archives.
</p>
<h2 id="bias">
Bias
</h2>
<p>
ML models are built using data. Recent advances in Deep Learning have
largely been the result of applying decades old algorithms to
increasingly large amounts of data collected from the web. The data that
is used to train these models is significant because the models
<em>necessarily</em> reflect the data that was used to create them.
Unfortunately corporations are increasingly tight lipped about the data
that has been used to train these models (more on that next).
</p>
<p>
Some commonly used datasets like CommonCrawl represent significantly
large collections of web data, but the web is a big place, and decisions
have gone into <a
href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/research/library/generative-ai-training-data/common-crawl/#executive-summary">what
websites were collected</a>. CommonCrawl is not representative of the
web as a whole. Furthermore LLMs encode biases that are present in
today’s society. Blindly using and becoming dependent on LLMs risks
further encrusting these biases and participating in systemic racism.
</p>
<p>
As LLMs are used to generate more and more web content there is also a
risk that this data is again collected and used to train future models.
This process has been called <a
href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/26/what_is_model_collapse/">Model
Collapse</a> and has been shown to lead to a <a
href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17493.pdf">process of forgetting</a>.
OpenAI launched a tool for identifying content generated with an LLM and
had to shut it down 6 months later because it didn’t work, and its not
clear that it can even be done with reliability. What would it mean to
only train these models with pre-2023 data?
</p>
<hr />
<p>
<strong>Tactic: When evaluating an AI tool always see if you can
identify what data has been used to train the model(s). How has it been
“cleaned” or shaped? How is it updated?</strong>
</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="intellectual-property">
Intellectual Property
</h2>
<p>
Since LLMs have been built with data collected from the web this
includes many types of content, from openly licensed datasets designed
to be shared, to copyrighted books like those found in the
<em>books1,2,3</em> datasets, which are rumored to have been assembled
from shadow libraries like Library Genesis and SciHub. Over the last
year we’ve seen several lawsuits including from the Authors Guild
challenging OpenAI’s use of copyrighted materials in building their GPT
models.
</p>
<p>
In some ways these types of lawsuits are not new to the web. Napster was
challenged by the Recording Industry Association of American; Google
Books was sued by the Authors Guild in the mid 2000s; the Internet
Archive has been recently sued over its Open Library platform. But what
makes LLMs a bit different is the way they transform the content they’ve
collected, rather than making it available verbatim. The US Copyright
Office published a <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/ai/">notice of
inquiry</a> last year to gather information about the use of copyrighted
materials in AI tools, which we can expect to hear more about this year.
</p>
<p>
But this is not just an issue for blatantly pirated material.
</p>
<p>
Many websites are <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html">The
New York Times is also suing</a> because of how millions of their openly
published news stories were used by OpenAI to train their models,
without a license. OpenAI is in the midst of <a
href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/4/24025409/openai-training-data-lowball-nyt-ai-copyright">trying
to negotiate</a> licensing contracts after the fact with many big
players.
</p>
<p>
The way LLMs function represents a big shift in how the web ecosystem
has evolved. Web search engines like Google crawl web pages to index
them, and provide users with search results that link back to the
original website. Similarly, social media platforms have provided a
place to discuss web content by sharing links to it, driving other users
to the web publisher.
</p>
<p>
In the LLM paradigm users never leave the ChatGPT interface, and the
original publisher is completely cut out of the virtuous circle. LLMs
are enclosing the web commons, and threaten to choke off the very
sources of content that they used. Web publishers will lose the ability
to understand how their content is being used.
</p>
<p>
Some web publishers have chosen to tell LLM bots to stop using
robots.txt. Not all the bots collecting data from the web for LLMs will
respect robots.txt files. In one experiment <a
href="https://palewi.re/docs/news-homepages/openai-gptbot-robotstxt.html">Ben
Welsh found</a> that 54% of news publishers (628 out of 1156) have
decided to block OpenAI, Google AI, or CommonCrawl.

tools. What would our donors want?</strong>
</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="verifiability">
Verifiability
</h2>
<p>
One of the reasons why ChatGPT doesn’t link to websites as citations is
that <em>it doesn’t know what to link to</em>. In LLMs the neural
network doesn’t record information about where a particular piece of
data came from. As LLMs get integrated into more traditional search
tools the challenge is to <a
href="https://ethanzuckerman.com/2023/10/10/heather-ford-is-the-web-eating-itself-llms-versus-verifiability/A">make
generated text verifiable</a> in the sense that the results include
in-line citations, which should support the statement that they are used
in.
</p>
<p>
Verifiability is important for understanding when generated content is
out of alignment with the world, a so called “hallucination”. It’s also
important for explaining why the model generated the response it did,
when trying to debug why some interaction went wrong. Explainability is
an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01029">active research area</a>
in the ML/AI community, and it’s not clear that given the model size and
the size of the training data, whether the models can be made
explainable, because at a fundamental level <a
href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-ai-knows-things-no-one-told-it/">we
don’t understand</a> why they work. Generative AI applications that
include citations have been <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09848">shown to be unreliable</a>, and
provide a false sense of security.
</p>
<p>
The lack of explainability in LLMs presents real problems for libraries
and archives whose raison d’être is to provide users with documents,
whether they are books, maps, photographs, sound recordings, films,
letters, etc. We describe these documents, and preserve these documents,
in order to provide access to them, so that users can derive meaning
from them. If we use an LLM to generate a response to a query or prompt,
and we can’t back up the response with citations to these documents,
this a problem.
</p>
<p>
This lack of verifiability is starting to be a problem for <a

too.

</h2>
<p>
Part of the value proposition behind recent AI tools like GitHub’s
Copilot, ChatGPT or DALL-E is that they <em>democratize</em> access to
some skill whether it be writing code, authoring news stories, or
creating illustrations. But is it democratic to systematically undermine
creative workers, by stealing their content without having asked to use
it in the first place?
</p>
<p>
When you make a decision to use these tools you are potentially <a
href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-12-21/artificial-intelligence-artists-stability-ai-digital-images">replacing</a>
a person’s skill with a service. Furthermore you are binding your own
organization to the whims of a corporation which would like nothing
better than for you to <a
href="https://www.gitclear.com/coding_on_copilot_data_shows_ais_downward_pressure_on_code_quality">divest</a>
of your organization’s expertise and become completely dependent on
their service. It’s a trap.
</p>
<p>
If the past is any guide, we can also expect that skilled creative jobs
will be replaced with lower paid jobs that involve mundane <a
href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkap3m/gpt-4-cant-replace-striking-tv-writers-but-studios-are-going-to-try">cleaning</a>
of the messes that have been made by automation. Or in the words of
screenwriter C. Robert Cargill (quoted in the previous link):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The immediate fear of AI isn’t that us writers will have our work
replaced by artificially generated content. It’s that we will be
underpaid to rewrite that trash into something we could have done better
from the start. This is what the WGA is opposing and the studios want.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
LLMs like ChatGPT are built using a technique called Reinforcement
Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). The important part here is the
human feedback. <a
href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300261479/behind-the-screen/">Who

through a better understanding of how neural networks work, but by using
existing algorithms with massive amounts of data and compute resources.
This training can takes months of time, and needs to be repeated to keep
models up to date.
</p>
<p>
Apparently the initial training of GPT-4 took $100 million. The training
relies on Graphical Processor Units (GPU) which are faster than CPUs for
the types of computation that LLMs demand, but require up to four times
as much energy to run. Data centers require <a

a problem for training models, it’s a bigger problem for <a

them</a> which has been estimated to be 60-100 times more in terms of
energy utilization. Another problem lurking here is the lack of data
from data centers that provides transparency about what is going on.

<p>
Is this the really the right direction for us to be headed as we are
trying to reduce energy costs globally to limit global warming?

The tech industry is incentivized to try to make AI infrastructures more

<p>
Generative AI is a dual use technology. Experts are increasingly worried
that it will be used to create disinformation as well as fake
interactions online. We’ve had court cases where filings made by lawyers
contained <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/27/nyregion/avianca-airline-lawsuit-chatgpt.html">citations
to cases</a> that didn’t exist. AI generated voice <a
href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-ai-generated-misinformation-threatens-election-integrity">robo-calls</a>
have been made illegal because of how AI tools were used to impersonate
Biden’s voice. Bad actors can manipulate images and video to target
specific groups because the tools are more powerful and accessible.
There are possible ways to mitigate this by using trusted sources of
information and provable ways of sharing the provenance of media.
</p>
<p>
Since the mechanics of how LLMs generate content are not explainable
they are susceptible to attacks like what Simon Willison calls <a
href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/14/worst-that-can-happen/">prompt
injection</a>. This is where a prompt is crafted to subvert the original
design of the system to generate an intended response. This has serious
ramifications for the use of LLM technology as glue between other
automated systems. Indeed this was recently <a
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02817">demonstrated</a> by researchers
using OpenAI and Google APIs to execute arbitrary code, and exfiltrate
personal information.
</p>
<p>
While its not great to conflate privacy with security, I’m running out
of time, and it’s important to note that privacy is also a problem. As
LLM APIs are deeply integrated into applications, data will flow from
one context into another. For example <a
href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/docusign-tapping-user-data-to-train-ai-models-offers-vague-privacy-promises">Docusign</a>
and Dropbox recently announced that they were integrated OpenAI into

may not use it to further train their models.

## ★ Once More Unto the Apple / Epic / European-Commission Breach, Dear Friends, Once More

Although Apple as an institution granted, revoked, and under public pressure reinstated Epic’s new account, from the perspective of Apple leadership, they only revoked a new account that had been created through an automated system — not for criticism, per se, but for the same reason Epic’s Fortnite developer account remains revoked and Fortnite remains unavailable on Apple platforms worldwide: for the 2020 Fortnite IAP Trojan horse stunt.

## US State Department Requests $4 Billion To Outcompete China

date: 2024-03-12, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The United States must employ "all the tools at our disposal" to outcompete China, a top U.S. State Department official said on Monday, as the Biden administration unveiled its budget request for the 2025 fiscal year.


The request includes $4 billion over five years in mandatory funding for this purpose, including $2 billion to create a new international infrastructure fund to provide a credible, reliable alternative to Chinese infrastructure funding, Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources Rich Verma told a news briefing.


The other $2 billion was earmarked for "game-changing investments" to help Indo-Pacific countries push back against "predatory efforts," he said, adding that those would include efforts to improve governance and the rule of law.


The State Department requested a separate $4 billion in discretionary funding to cover foreign assistance and diplomatic engagement in the region.


U.S. efforts to fund infrastructure in developing countries have long been dwarfed by China's massive Belt and Road Initiative, a 10-year-old project to build infrastructure and energy networks connecting Asia with Africa and Europe through overland and maritime routes.


According to a report by U.S. researchers last November, Chinese financial institutions lent $1.34 trillion to developing countries from 2000 to 2021.


"We must employ all the tools at our disposal to outcompete China, wherever possible," Verma said, also referring to China by the initials of its official name, the People's Republic of China (PRC).


He said the request for fiscal 2025 would allow the U.S. "to continue to invest in the foundations of our strength at home, align with like-minded partners to strengthen our shared interests and address the challenges posed by the PRC, and harness those assets to compete with the PRC and defend our interests."


Verma said the infrastructure fund would support "transformative, quality and sustainable hard infrastructure projects."


At the 2023 G20 Summit in India, U.S. officials said President Joe Biden and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi co-hosted a group of G20 leaders to accelerate investments in high-quality infrastructure projects and development of economic corridors through a Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI).


This came after the Group of Seven rich Western countries' leaders pledged in 2022 to raise $600 billion in private and public funds over five years to finance needed infrastructure in developing countries and counter the Belt and Road project.


Overseas finance has won Beijing friends across the developing world, while drawing criticism from the West and in some recipient countries, including Sri Lanka and Zambia, that infrastructure projects it funded saddled them with debt they were unable to repay.

## Former US Official's Work for Chinese Client Stirs Concern Over Disclosure Loopholes

date: 2024-03-12, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — When a Chinese drone company came under U.S. government scrutiny over its alleged ties to China's military, the company turned to one of America's pre-eminent lawyers: Loretta Lynch, a former attorney general in the Obama administration.


Lynch, who ran the U.S. Department of Justice from 2015 to 2017 and is now a partner at the Paul, Weiss law firm, wrote a letter to a senior Defense Department official last July on behalf of SZ DJI Technology Co Ltd, asking that her client be removed from a list of Chinese military companies.


Advocating for foreign clients is legal and U.S. law includes a public disclosure exemption for lawyers.


But the letter, seen by Reuters, is an example of what transparency advocates and some members of Congress - dozens of whom have supported bills to change rules - say are gaps in the law that allow lawyers and lobbyists, including former officials, to avoid disclosing their advocacy for companies possibly subject to U.S. sanctions.


The Paul, Weiss law firm declined to comment on the letter, and Lynch did not respond to Reuters emails. DJI also declined to comment, but it has said previously that it is not a military company and that it was prepared to formally challenge its inclusion on the list.


The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), a decades-old law requiring public disclosure of work done on behalf of non-U.S. entities, includes a list of exemptions, including for commercial activities and legal representation.


The work by the onetime top U.S. law enforcement officer on behalf of a company the Department of Defense says poses "threats to national security" comes as U.S. agencies warn about companies with links to China's Communist Party and as lawmakers push to tighten FARA's disclosure requirements.


The U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments say DJI supported biometric surveillance and tracking of Muslim Uyghur minorities in China.


The Defense Department did not respond to a request for comment on Lynch's letter. DJI remained on the Pentagon list when it was updated in late January.


The Justice Department also declined comment on the letter and broader FARA enforcement.


Almost a dozen critics of FARA told Reuters the law's loopholes have allowed less transparency for other companies with alleged ties to China's military, including surveillance technology firm Hikvision and biotech firm WuXi AppTec.


Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, says reforms to the law are needed, given the blurry lines between many Chinese companies and the Chinese government, and to keep former members of the U.S. government from effectively lobbying on their behalf.


"It is appalling that former senior U.S. officials use their connections to serve the interests of U.S. adversaries," Risch said.


However, the American Civil Liberties Union and others assert that broadening disclosure requirements could act as a barrier to legally protected free speech.


In 2022 the ACLU and 13 other groups wrote to the Justice Department about their concerns, cautioning that problems with the law could "enable selective enforcement for bad faith or malicious reasons."


Others argue that stricter FARA rules on disclosure could give authoritarian countries like Russia and China cover for their own stifling of free speech.


Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law school professor, said some countries, such as Russia, label citizens and reporters as foreign agents to limit their activities.


"I do have concerns over some past investigations and prosecutions that targeted individuals who appeared to be engaging in First Amendment activities," Turley told Reuters.


Requesting a meeting


The Pentagon in 2022 placed DJI on its Chinese Military Companies list, a designation that serves as a warning about the risks of conducting business with those entities.


In her letter to Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Taylor-Kale on behalf of DJI, Lynch urged the department to promptly remove the drone maker.


"The wide use and dependence on DJI products by a variety of U.S. stakeholders reinforces the importance and urgency of deleting DJI from the list," Lynch wrote.


She added that DJI requested "a meeting to discuss this matter." Reuters could not establish whether that meeting occurred.


Also signing the letter, labeled "confidential treatment requested," were former Assistant United States Attorney Michael Gertzman and Associate White House Counsel in the Obama administration Roberto Gonzalez – now both partners at Paul, Weiss.


Gertzman and Gonzalez did not respond to requests for comment.


FARA enforcement has intensified in recent years, with the Justice Department prosecuting individuals for their work on behalf of Chinese interests and pushing some law firms to register.


Paul, Weiss attorneys have acknowledged growing enforcement tied to China.


In a 2022 memo to clients about a U.S. court's dismissal of a FARA case against casino magnate Steve Wynn, Lynch, Gonzalez and other Paul, Weiss attorneys wrote: "The targeting of lobbying on behalf of China by the DOJ is further evidence of the Biden Administration's intention to use all of the legal tools at its disposal in a multi-faceted strategy to counter the perceived threat posed by China."


Paul, Weiss did not respond to questions about the memo and a White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


At the Justice Department's request, the Sidley Austin law firm in 2022 retroactively registered its lobbying on behalf of Hikvision, a company the U.S. says has been implicated in human rights violations toward Uyghurs.


Sidley Austin declined to comment on its registration. While the firm had not originally filed under FARA it had disclosed under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, which has less rigorous disclosure requirements, according to the Justice Department.


The Justice Department has called for the repeal of an LDA exemption from FARA filing.


Hikvision did not respond to a request for comment but has previously denied reports that the company is complicit in human rights abuses.


Congressional pressure again has begun to tick up.


On March 5, the House of Representatives select committee on China asked the Justice Department to review trade association Biotechnology Innovation Organization's lobbying on behalf of Chinese biotech firm WuXi AppTec for possible FARA requirements.


BIO told Reuters that its advocacy was fulfilling its duty to let Congress and patients know the impact of potential policies and "nothing more."


WuXi AppTec, when asked by Reuters about the House committee's request, said it objected to "inaccurate assertions and preemptive actions against our company without due process," adding it was confident lawmakers would see it as a trusted partner.


Reform is up to Congress


Some experts, including those who have concerns about extending FARA's reach, agree the law is vague and presents particular challenges for attorneys.


David Laufman, a partner at law firm Wiggin and Dana who previously oversaw the Justice Department's FARA enforcement, said while lawyers may not need to register under FARA if they avoid policy discussions with government officials, the only way to know for certain is to seek an opinion from the Justice Department.


"In the meantime, life goes on for attorneys. We have to represent our clients," he said.


Reforms to the law would be up to Congress. Several bipartisan bills to close FARA loopholes have been proposed.


One, proposed last year in the House and Senate, could require retroactive FARA registration by anyone who acts as an "agent for a foreign principal."

## Palau’s President Relieved by Security Pact Funding Approval

date: 2024-03-12, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Critical funds to counter China in the Pacific are finally on their way to three U.S. allies: Palau, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands.


On Friday, the Senate passed a funding package that provides $7 billion over 20 years for the Compacts of Free Association (COFA) as part of a partial government funding bill. It was signed into law by President Joe Biden over the weekend.


“Extending Compact-related assistance is a critical component of the administration’s Pacific Partnership, Indo-Pacific, and National Security Strategies,” said U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a statement. “We look forward to working with our partners in the Freely Associated States over the next two decades of COFA-related cooperation.”


The compacts are agreements that give the U.S. strategic access to these regions of the Pacific Ocean. In return, the U.S. provides grants to fund education, health care and infrastructure in these nations, whose citizens are then entitled to study, work and live in the U.S. without a visa.


The United States has had compact agreements in effect with Micronesia and the Marshalls since 1986 and with Palau since 1994.


The compacts' renewals were signed last year but funding stalled as U.S. lawmakers struggled to reach agreement on full-year spending. Palau has been forced to borrow to pay for basic government services like education and health care while waiting for $890 million — its share of the funds.


“It’s not Oct. 1, but it’s at least within this fiscal year, and really just in time,” Palau President Surangel Whipps Jr. told VOA in an interview on Monday.


“[This] allows us to stop borrowing to keep government operations going; it allows us to hire those critical police officers, health care workers and education teachers that we need,” he said.


Palau’s economy tanked after Chinese tourism dropped by more than 50% in the wake of the COVID pandemic. The island nation maintains diplomatic relations with Taiwan under repeated pressure from Beijing to switch alliances.


Whipps says he recently met with investors from Singapore and Japan, as well as United Airlines with a request for direct service to Japan. He said now that COFA is funded, he can promise a stable and secure environment to financiers.


“[It’s important that we’re] opening up new markets so that we're diversified and more resilient, not so dependent on the Chinese tourism, which could be weaponized,” said Whipps.


Coordinated push


The final passage comes after a coordinated pressure campaign, from members of Congress as well as the Pacific region.


“The COFA agreements send a clear message of U.S. commitment to the Pacific region and take a much-needed international strong stand for the ideals of democracy and freedom,” American Samoa Representative Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen said in a statement after the House passed COFA on Wednesday.


“I’ve appreciated the partnership of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and thank the many advocates -- in Hawaii and in COFA communities across the country -- whose hard work made this victory possible,” Hawaii Senator Mazie Hirono said in a statement after the Senate passed COFA, Friday.


The leaders of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands joined Whipps in February in drafting a letter to congressional leaders warning of the consequences of not funding the compacts.




Like Palau, the Marshall Islands maintains diplomatic relations with Taiwan, while Micronesia has diplomatic relations with Beijing.


“There have been ‘carrot and stick’ efforts from the PRC [People’s Republic of China] to shift our alliances, including discontinuing support of Taiwan,” Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine wrote in the February letter.


At a Nuclear Remembrance Day ceremony in the Marshall Islands on March 1, President Heine said the funding delay had created doubt.


“At some point, our nation needs to seriously consider other options available to us if the U.S. is unable or unwilling to keep its commitments to us. Our nation has been a steadfast ally of the United States, but that should not be taken for granted,” she told the audience.




Delay sends signal


Experts say Washington’s funding delay sent a signal to the rest of the Pacific that undermines U.S. credibility.


“They see our agreements with these three Pacific nations as the bellwether for our entire engagement with the region,” Kathryn Hendel Paik, Center for Strategic and International Studies senior fellow, said Monday in an interview with VOA.


“Our waffling on this has really made them question a relationship that they were already starting to be skeptical on because, historically, we have not always been there for the Pacific and we’ve not always showed up the way we should have,” she said.


Charles Paul, Marshall Islands ambassador to the U.S., told VOA via Zoom on Monday, “We’re looking forward to having the compacts approved.”


He added that the agreement includes about $700 million to address the health impacts of radiation introduced in the 67 American atmospheric nuclear tests between 1946 and 1958.


In a 13-minute video posted Saturday on Facebook, Wesley Sinima, president of the Federated States of Micronesia, said the funding delay stirred up “doubt and uncertainty.” He added, however, that the final agreement will “contribute to greater peace and prosperity” for the Micronesian people and “greater security and stability for the Indo-Pacific region and the world.”




As for Palau, President Whipps said he’s been invited to Washington in the coming weeks for an exchange of diplomatic notes to finalize the compacts. He hopes to attend.

## US Commits $100 Million More to Multinational Force for Haiti Amid Violence

date: 2024-03-12, from: VOA News USA

STATE DEPARTMENT — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced on Monday the United States would commit an additional $100 million to a United Nations-backed multinational security force intended to assist Haitian police in combating gangs, along with $33 million in humanitarian aid.


This would bring the total of U.S. contribution to the security force to $300 million.


In February, the United States pledged $200 million to support the Kenya-led Multinational Security Support mission, or MSS, in Haiti. The U.S. said that the deployment of the mission will help the Haitian National Police create the security conditions necessary to conduct free and fair elections.


Monday, Blinken joined Caribbean leaders in Kingston, Jamaica, to discuss a proposal to "expedite a political transition" to resolve the unfolding crisis in Haiti, including possible deployment of the U.N.-backed multinational security forces. 


The proposal, developed in partnership with the Caribbean Community, known as CARICOM, and Haitian stakeholders, comes as Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry faces pressure to resign or agree to a transitional council. 


According to a statement by U.S. officials, the transition would occur via "the creation of a broad-based, independent presidential college," a reference to a proposed committee that would oversee Haiti ahead of elections. 


In Kingston, Blinken said that the Haitian people are confronting “a political crisis, escalating violence, unrest,” an “untenable situation” that requires urgent action both politically and in terms of security.


State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told VOA that the United States aims to accelerate the deployment of the U.N.-backed mission U.N. Multinational Security Support, or MSS, mission in Haiti, because escalating gang violence is endangering its government. 


"We continue to look to expedite that mission as soon as possible," Miller said during a Monday briefing, adding the U.S. has been in conversation about the deployment with the government of Kenya and other countries.


"I can assure you that the United States will do its part to fund that important mission," Miller said. 


UN reaction 


At the United Nations, all 15 U.N. Security Council members strongly condemned "the increasing violence, criminal activities, mass displacement of civilians and human rights abuses" in a Monday statement. 


U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' chief of staff is representing the U.N. at the CARICOM meeting in Kingston. 


"The MSS mission is a critical step toward creating an environment conducive to free and fair elections, as well as alleviating the humanitarian crisis," said U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield. 


The expedient MSS deployment is a top priority for U.S. President Joe Biden's administration, she said. 


Canada has committed $91.2 million, and others, including Benin, France, Germany, Jamaica and Spain, have announced financial, personnel and logistical support. 


Sunday, the U.S. military airlifted nonessential embassy personnel from Haiti and deployed additional U.S. forces to reinforce embassy security. This operation is in response to escalating gang violence that has prompted hundreds of thousands to flee their homes and threatens to bring down the government. 


The State Department said the security situation in Haiti is "unpredictable and dangerous," and the U.S. Embassy's ability to assist U.S. citizens is "severely limited." 


 




The State Department's travel advisory for Haiti has remained at Level Four — do not travel to Haiti — since July 2023.


"U.S. Embassy Port-au-Prince has been on Ordered Departure status since July 27, 2023. Adjustments during this time are not uncommon, nor do they represent a change in our overall posture," a State Department spokesperson told VOA. 


Concerns from critics 


Some critics note that while both Democratic and Republican lawmakers support ensuring a more stable Haiti, some are concerned about the Biden administration's policy toward the nation. 


Ana Rosa Quintana-Lovett, a senior policy director for the Vandenberg Coalition think tank in Washington, said Haiti's political future is not being driven by Haitians but rather by the international donor community.


She told VOA Monday that Haitian Prime Minister Henry's "leadership is untenable" and that Henry fails to grasp that he does not have the support of the Haitian people.


"The United States needs to understand that whatever diplomatic messages they are publicly releasing, frankly, are falling on (Henry's) deaf ears," she added. 


She also pointed out congressional concerns over proposed Kenyan-led multinational forces. "Kenyan forces don't speak Creole, so how are they going to engage and work with the Haitian National Police? I mean, there are just so many loopholes in the approach," she said. 


Dire situation 


Haiti declared a state of emergency on March 3, following attacks by gangs on the main prisons in the capital city of Port-au-Prince. Prime Minister Henry was in Kenya at the time, finalizing a deal for a U.N.-supported peacekeeping mission aimed at addressing Haiti's gang violence. 


The gangs demanded Henry's resignation. He is reportedly stranded in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico.


Amid escalating gang violence in Port-au-Prince, the Haitian government extended the state of emergency until April 3, and the nighttime curfew until Monday. 


According to the International Organization for Migration's office in Haiti, the violence perpetrated by armed gangs has forced over 360,000 people across Haiti to flee their homes. 


UNICEF has warned that critical social services in Haiti are on the verge of collapse, and that the humanitarian response that millions of children and civilians rely on as a last resort has been severely impaired. 


Political transition process 


Henry was appointed, not elected, after the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in 2021. Henry had initially promised to step down by early February but later said security must be reestablished first to conduct free and fair elections.


On February 29, CARICOM said the Haitian prime minister had committed to organizing general elections by August 31, 2025. CARICOM stated its intention to send an assessment team by March 31 of this year to evaluate electoral needs, aiming to support the planning and establishment of relevant institutions.

## Pentagon Needs $10B to Replace Weapons Already Sent to Ukraine, Officials Say

date: 2024-03-12, from: VOA News USA

pentagon — The Pentagon has a funding shortfall of about $10 billion for U.S. military weapons needed to replace those already sent to Ukraine, a shortfall that requires additional money from Congress to fix, top Defense Department officials said Monday.


“We don't foresee a likely alternative outside of the supplemental funding [bill] or having that money added into an appropriations bill in order to achieve the replenishment that we need,” Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks told reporters.


“We are probably looking at about $10 billion to replace everything, everything that we’ve given in terms of supplies to Ukraine,” one official told VOA.


Pentagon officials expected to get the funding to replenish those stocks in a supplemental request from the Biden administration, which included billions of additional dollars in aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. However, Congress has yet to pass a supplemental aid bill because of arguments on spending and U.S. border security.


The shortfall is tied to the way the Pentagon has accounted for the aid sent to Ukraine. Last June, the Pentagon said it overestimated the value of weapons sent to Ukraine by about $6.2 billion over the past two years.


When calculating its aid package estimates, the Department of Defense was counting the cost incurred to replace the weapons given to Ukraine, while it said it should have been totaling the cost of the systems actually sent, officials told VOA at the time.


The error provided the Pentagon the legal cover needed to send more aid to Ukraine, but the problem remained that more funds would be needed to replenish U.S. military stockpiles with newer, costlier weapons.


Failing to replenish U.S. stockpiles would negatively affect the military’s readiness, another defense official told VOA.


The department still has about $4 billion in authority to send aid to Ukraine, but Pentagon officials have told reporters that sending additional aid without the ability to replenish U.S. weapons stockpiles would be a risk the Defense Department is not willing to take at this time.


But Retired Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery, a defense analyst with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told VOA there are key weapons the U.S. could send Kyiv without compromising military readiness, “because the Army no longer needs them.”


One weapon would be 155-millimeter cluster munitions, which Montgomery says the U.S. doesn’t use in combat planning.


“That would give 155-mm ammunition to the Ukrainians very quickly,” he said.


Another weapon that could be immediately sent without incurring a cost on U.S. military readiness would be M113 armored vehicles.


“We have thousands of them that we’re getting rid of. We could transfer these to Ukraine,” he told VOA.

## Where Heat Pumps Win — And Where They Lose

date: 2024-03-12, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTcwNTg4My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMDUxMTcxOH0.EfoDR6BjMqogYUTSURSlHzSiLZivCxFdUc6tmfw82sw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Some Americans install heat pumps because they care about climate change. But most people aren’t going to make the switch until it makes sense economically. Pinpointing where and for whom heat pumps are a good investment is surprisingly tricky because U.S. housing is so diverse, with a wide range of building sizes and ages, situated in different local climates with different utility rates.</p><p>But for the first time, researchers at the National Renewable Energy Lab have sorted through much of this complexity to get deeper to the truth about the costs, benefits, and challenges of deploying heat pumps in the U.S. </p><p>Ultimately, they <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/press/2024/benefits-of-heat-pumps-detailed-in-new-nrel-report.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a> that heat pumps are a cost-effective choice in roughly 65 million U.S. homes, or about 60% of the country — and that’s before taking into account available subsidies. But there are substantial economic barriers to widespread adoption.</p><p>It’s hard to overstate how detailed the study is. The authors started with a model of 550,000 statistically representative households — basically housing archetypes that typify different combinations of building size, age, occupancy level, local climate, heating usage patterns, and existing heating systems. Each one represents about 242 real-world households. Then the authors looked at how switching to a heat pump would affect greenhouse gas emissions and energy bills across all of these different homes in a wide range of scenarios. They considered heat pumps with lower and higher efficiency ratings, and whether or not the building owner pursued insulation upgrades. They looked at different scenarios for how quickly the grid would decarbonize, how sensitive the results were to energy prices, and how <a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/inflation-reduction-act-solar-panels-heat-pumps" target="_self">subsidies from the Inflation Reduction Act</a> affect the economics.</p><p>The paper has many interesting findings beyond the top-line result. Here are five things that stood out.</p><h2>1. Heat pumps will lower greenhouse gas emissions immediately, period.</h2><p>Eric Wilson, a senior research engineer at NREL and the study’s lead author, told me one of his motivations was to try to settle the question of whether heat pumps reduce emissions. </p><p>“I see a lot of people saying, well, the grid is still dirty in this state, and maybe it makes sense to wait five years to put in a heat pump because it could increase emissions,” he said.</p><p>But he found that in each of the 48 contiguous U.S. states, switching to a heat pump reduces emissions today, even if that heat pump is one of the cheaper, less-efficient models. Heat pumps are just so much more efficient than other options that they still reduce emissions despite today’s relatively dirty grid. </p><p>On average, each home could cut between 2.5 to 4.4 tons of carbon over the approximately 16 years the equipment lasts, meaning widespread adoption could result in a 5% to 9% drop in national economy-wide emissions. The effect is much more pronounced in some states, like those in the Northeast, where a lot of homes currently use fossil fuels for heating. A household in Maine that installs a high efficiency model, combined with completing insulation upgrades, would reduce emissions by an average of 11 tons per year — or about the equivalent of taking two cars off the road for a year.</p><h2>2. The best heat pumps need to get a lot cheaper. </h2><p>The study breaks down the costs of switching to a heat pump in a few different ways. </p><p>First, there’s the up-front costs of upgrading to a heat pump, which are relatively high. A lower-rated, less efficient heat pump system may be a cheaper option than a new furnace or boiler for about 43% of households. But a higher-performing heat pump is almost always more expensive, costing an extra $8,000 to $13,000 before government subsidies (more on them later). That alone might keep heat pumps out of reach for many households.</p><p>Next, there's the potential for bill savings — which is significant. Using state average electricity and gas rates in the winter of 2021 to 2022, the study found that 86% of households can save money on their utility bills by switching to a medium-efficiency heat pump, and a whopping 95% of households will see their bills go down if they install the highest efficiency system. </p><p>So in theory, if homeowners do have the extra cash to put down, there’s a chance they could make up for high up-front costs in bill savings over time. But how good a chance?</p><p>Putting this all together, the authors looked at what percentage of households that upgraded to heat pumps would see a positive cash flow, calculated as the “net present value,” from the initial investment. Here, the results were less rosy. In many cases, high up-front costs cancel out potential savings. For example, despite the near-certain bill savings from buying one of the most efficient heat pump models, only 21% of households would see an overall economic benefit from the switch.</p><p>Still, more than half of all homes would see a positive cash flow by switching to a cheaper, minimum-efficiency heat pump.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

Most natural gas utilities charge customers a fixed amount each month, regardless of how much gas they use. If a homeowner switches to heat pumps but continues using gas for cooking, they’ll still have to pay the full fee, which can be as high as $34 a month, whereas homes that fully electrify can avoid these fees.</p><h2>4. Heat pumps might increase costs for homes without air conditioners.</h2><p>The results I described in the previous two sections include homes both with and without existing air conditioning systems of some kind. (With the exception of the maps, which only consider homes that have air conditioning already.) </p><p>But since heat pumps provide both heating and cooling, the economics are actually quite different for those households who already have air conditioners versus those who don't. If a household already has A/C, heat pumps appear more favorable, because a family would be able to replace two systems — an air conditioner and a furnace — with just one. If there is no pre-existing air conditioner, the heat pump will not only have higher up-front costs, but it’s more likely to increase energy bills, since the family might start using the heat pump for cooling in addition to heating.</p><p>Here are the same maps included in the previous section, but looking just at homes that do not have air conditioning.<span></span></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

However, that result doesn’t take into account the benefits of getting air conditioning for the first time.</p><p>“They didn't include the new value that someone has, especially in a warming world and a world with more heat waves, of now having an air conditioner in your home,” Kevin Kircher, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University, told me. “So if you add that in, I think the economics look better.”</p><h2>5. All signs point to the economics of heat pumps improving.</h2><p>None of the results in the previous sections take into account the various subsidies that states and the federal government offer for heat pumps. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act included a $2,000 tax credit for heat pumps and an additional $11,500 in rebates for low- and moderate-income households. Both will increase the percentage of households for whom the investment will pencil out.</p><p>The study also doesn’t take into account the potential for homes to use smart controls that optimize their systems, or the opportunity for households to participate in demand response programs which will pay them to turn down their thermostats by a few degrees when the grid is taxed. Kircher, the Purdue professor, recently <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306261924002034?casa_token=b1I2w61GKBoAAAAA:D51GrUXBwuRVh3We1XBqra_IRltnXLWwpvni4pwSbumyjprx0bhq50BLmm3E9xFUobRn1qxGG7c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published a study</a> of a real-world house in a cold climate where smart controls reduced heating energy costs by 23-34%.</p><p>Finally, one big takeaway from the study was that the results are very sensitive to the price ratio between natural gas rates and electricity rates, and there are reasons to believe that may become more favorable. For example, as more renewable energy is deployed, electricity could become more affordable. Meanwhile, if the U.S. increases exports of liquified natural gas, the cost of domestic natural gas could go up. The study cites a 2022 survey of oil and gas executives which found that 69% expect ‘‘the age of inexpensive U.S. natural gas to end by year-end 2025.”</p><p>“Big modeling like this entails a lot of assumptions about the future that are really hard to pin down with any real precision,” said Kircher. “But I think there's cause for optimism there.”</p>
