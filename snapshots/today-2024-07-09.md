## Former US Senator Inhofe, defense hawk and climate change skeptic, dies at 89

date: 2024-07-09, from: VOA News USA

OKLAHOMA CITY, oklahoma — Former Senator Jim Inhofe, a conservative known for his strong support of defense spending and his denial that human activity is responsible for the bulk of climate change, has died. He was 89. 


Inhofe, a powerful fixture in Oklahoma politics for more than six decades, died Tuesday morning after suffering a stroke during the July Fourth holiday, his family said in a statement. 


Inhofe, a Republican who underwent quadruple bypass heart surgery in 2013 before being elected to a fourth term, was elected to a fifth Senate term in 2020, before stepping down in early 2023. 


'The greatest hoax'


Inhofe frequently criticized the mainstream science that human activity contributed to changes in the Earth's climate, once calling it "the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people." 


In February 2015, with temperatures in the nation's capital below freezing, Inhofe brought a snowball on to the Senate floor. He tossed it before claiming that environmentalists focus attention on global warming as it kept getting cold. 


As Oklahoma's senior U.S. senator, Inhofe was a staunch supporter of the state's five military installations and a vocal fan of congressional earmarks. The Army veteran and licensed pilot, who would fly himself to and from Washington, secured the federal money to fund local road and bridge projects, and criticized House Republicans who wanted a one-year moratorium on such pet projects in 2010. 


"Defeating an earmark doesn't save a nickel," Inhofe told the Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce that August. "It merely means that within the budget process, it goes right back to the bureaucracy." 


He was a strong backer of President Donald Trump, who praised him for his "incredible support of our #MAGA agenda" while endorsing the senator's 2020 reelection bid. During the Trump administration, Inhofe served as chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee following the death of Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona. 


Closer to home, Inhofe helped secure millions of dollars to clean up a former mining hub in northeast Oklahoma that spent decades on the Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund list. In a massive buyout program, the federal government purchased homes and businesses within the 104-square-kilometer region of Tar Creek, where children consistently tested for dangerous levels of lead in their blood. 


Republican U.S. Representative Frank Lucas, the senior member of the Oklahoma congressional delegation, called Inhofe a true public servant. 


"His long career in the United States House and Senate serves as a testament to his strong moral compass and innate desire to better his home state," Lucas said in a statement 


In 2021, Inhofe defied some in his party by voting to certify Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election, saying that to do otherwise would be a violation of his oath of office to support and defend the Constitution. He voted against convicting Trump at both of his impeachment trials. 


Worked in business, public service


Born James Mountain Inhofe on Nov. 17, 1934, in Des Moines, Iowa, Inhofe grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and received a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Tulsa in 1959. He served in the Army between 1956 and 1958 and was a businessman for three decades. 


He was elected to the state House in 1966 and two years later to the state Senate, where he remained during unsuccessful runs for governor in 1974 and for the U.S. House in 1976. He then won three terms as Tulsa mayor starting in 1978. 


Inhofe went on to win two terms in the U.S. House in the 1980s, before throwing his hat into a bitter U.S. Senate race when longtime Senator David Boren resigned in 1994 to become president of the University of Oklahoma. Inhofe beat then-U.S. Representive Dave McCurdy in a special election to serve the final two years of Boren's term and was reelected five times. 


Boren, a Democrat, said he and Inhofe worked together in a bipartisan manner when both were in the state Legislature. He later defeated Inhofe in a race for governor. 


"While we ran against each other for governor, we were opponents but never enemies and remained friends," Boren said in a statement. "I hope we can rebuild that spirit in American politics." 


Frequent flyer


Inhofe was a commercial-rated pilot and flight instructor with more than 50 years of flying experience. 


He made an emergency landing in Claremore in 1999, after his plane lost a propeller, an incident later blamed on an installation error. In 2006, his plane spun out of control upon landing in Tulsa; he and an aide escaped injury, though the plane was badly damaged. 


In 2010, Inhofe landed his small plane on a closed runway at a rural South Texas airport while flying himself and others to South Padre Island. Runway workers scrambled, and Inhofe agreed to complete a remedial training program rather than face possible legal action. 


He later sponsored legislation that expanded the rights of pilots when dealing with Federal Aviation Administration disciplinary proceedings. 


Inhofe is survived by his wife, Kay, three children and several grandchildren. A son, Dr. Perry Dyson Inhofe II, died in November 2013, at the age of 51, when the twin-engine aircraft he was flying crashed a few miles north of Tulsa International Airport.

## Beryl Narrowly Missed the Gulf’s Energy Heartland

The Gulf of Mexico is not just a frequent target and breeding ground for massive storms, it is also one of America’s — and the world’s — most important energy hubs. Texas and Louisiana contains giant oil and gas fields, and the region is home to about <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/gas-prices-summer-hurricanes" target="_self"><u>half of the United States’ refining capacity</u></a>.</p><p>At least so far, the oil and refining industry appears to have largely dodged Beryl’s worst effects. The storm made landfall in Matagorda, a coastal town between Galveston and Corpus Christi, both of which are major centers for the refinery industry. Only one refinery, the Phillips 66 facility in Sweeny, Texas, was in the storm’s cone, <a href="https://www.tacenergy.com/news-and-views/gasoline-and-diesel-contracts-are-exchanging-hands-about-5-lower-than-where" target="_blank"><u>according to TACenergy</u></a>, a petroleum products distributor.

In Arkansas and Louisiana, about 35,000 electric customers are without power. ERCOT, the energy market for about 90% of Texas, described the current outages as “local in nature and not an ERCOT grid reliability issue,” indicating that the problem is with distribution and transmission, not <a href="https://x.com/ERCOT_ISO/status/1810300525088317828" target="_blank">supply and demand</a>.</p><p>The heavily industrialized Gulf Coast would seem to be a perfect spot to build out offshore wind infrastructure, but the regular hurricane-force winds in the region are <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/gulf-mexico-leases-offshore-wind" target="_self"><u>holding it back</u></a>. The Department of the Interior has successfully auctioned off <a href="https://www.boem.gov/renewable-energy/state-activities/gulf-mexico-activities" target="_blank">just one lease</a> for wind development off of Lake Charles, Louisiana near the Texas border.

## Climate Scored Some Quasi-Victories in Europe

date: 2024-07-09, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjU1ODc1OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MDM1MTMyN30.6wYy0HzBZpl4xU5RV-TkcvrDoJRHK200P00CKP0RT90/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>While America has been distracted by its suddenly-very-real upcoming election, two other important political stories have been unfolding across the pond. The results of last week’s parliamentary votes in France and the United Kingdom have the power to sway global climate policy — and they might even contain lessons for the U.S. about the rise (or fall) of the far-right. </p>
<h3>What happened in France?</h3><p>In June, French President Emmanuel Macron called snap elections, and the far-right National Rally party led by Marine Le Pen was widely expected to achieve a majority in the country’s 577-seat National Assembly. Instead, the New Popular Front, a hastily-formed alliance between the hard left, Greens, and Socialists, came out on top in a runoff, followed by the centrist Ensemble (which includes Macron’s Renaissance party) and the National Rally in a distant third. Because no party won the 289 seats needed to gain control of the chamber, the left and center now have to form a coalition government, which means ideological compromise — something that’s distinctly un-French. “We're not the Germans, we're not the Spanish, we're not the Italians — we don't do coalitions,” one French political commentator <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/france-elections-latest-far-right-national-rally-hoping-to-win-majority-as-second-round-vote-sees-huge-rise-in-turnout-13173764" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told</u></a> <em><em>Sky News</em></em>.</p>
<h3>What did the National Rally want for climate?</h3><p>Climate change wasn’t a big theme, but the National Rally’s proposals certainly had experts nervous. The party tapped into <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/bears-cars-angry-farmers-fuel-green-deal-backlash-eu-agenda-european-commission-ursula-von-der-leyen/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>simmering discontent</u></a> among some demographics — <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20240223-angry-french-farmers-drive-their-tractors-into-paris-in-fresh-protests" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>farmers, in particular</u></a> — who feel unfairly burdened by new regulations in service of the European Union’s ambitious agenda, known as the <a href="https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/climate-strategies-targets/2030-climate-targets_en#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20the%20EU%20adopted,climate%2Dneutral%20continent%20by%202050." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Green Deal</u></a>, including a goal to cut the bloc’s net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. If it had won, the party planned to dismantle France’s energy efficiency rules, roll back a 2035 ban on new gas-powered cars, block new wind farms, do away with low-emission zones, and transform electricity trade. France is already the EU’s third biggest emitter, and the EU as a whole is responsible for <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Greenhouse_gas_emission_statistics_-_carbon_footprints#:~:text=The%20EU's%20consumption%20(final%20demand,through%20imports%20into%20the%20EU." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>about 9%</u></a> of global CO2 emissions, although <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/09/eu-greenhouse-gas-emissions-transport/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>emissions have been falling</u></a>, especially in the energy sector.</p>
<h3>So is European climate policy safe? </h3><p>As the dust settles in France, the biggest danger to climate policy now is stalemate. The lackluster results for the far right are no doubt a relief to the climate conscious. “We have avoided a catastrophe,” Alain Fischer, president of the French Academy of Sciences in Paris, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02260-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told</u></a> <em><em>Nature</em></em>. The winning NFP, for its part, backs the Green Deal’s emissions targets and wants France to become “the European leader in renewable energies” through offshore wind power and the development of hydroelectric power. It also calls for the “creation of an international court for climate and environmental justice.” But the next several months are likely to be chaotic as the parties tussle over what the government should look like, and there is no deadline for these decisions to be made. The leadership limbo could bring political paralysis at a time when the EU is just <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/frances-allies-relieved-by-le-pen-loss-wonder-whats-next-2024-07-08/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>getting its bearings</u></a> following bloc-wide parliamentary elections — which, by the way, saw the Greens lose seats in lots of places. In response, the non-profit Climate Group put out a <a href="https://www.theclimategroup.org/our-work/news/climate-group-responds-french-parliamentary-election-results" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>statement</u></a> calling for the French government to “commit to safeguarding the EU Green Deal and ensuring a sustainable future for the continent.” The good news is that a <a href="https://x.com/DaveKeating/status/1799489322028023839" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>large majority</u></a> of EU voters want to see more climate action. </p><h3>What about in the U.K.?</h3><p>The Labour Party won the general election in a landslide, bringing an end to 14 years of Conservative Party rule. During his tenure, former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-qa-what-do-rishi-sunaks-u-turns-mean-for-uk-climate-policy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>watered down</u></a> key net-zero strategies, delayed a ban on new combustion engine vehicles, scrapped energy efficiency standards, and approved a large new oil field in the North Sea. His party also pulled <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/07/tories-pledge-to-reverse-ulez-expansion-and-limit-20mph-roads-in-wales" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>low-emission zones into the culture wars</u></a> in a desperate attempt to win over voters. None of this played to his advantage. <a href="https://www.desmog.com/2024/07/08/two-thirds-of-anti-net-zero-tories-wiped-out-in-uk-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>According to Desmog</u></a>, two-thirds of the Conservative members of Parliament who were anti-net zero lost their seats, including the former energy secretary. “With a clear mandate for climate action,” <a href="https://www.e3g.org/news/the-uk-is-back-in-the-race-to-net-zero/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wrote</u></a> climate change think tank E3G, “all eyes are now on Labour to deliver.”</p>
<h3>What does Labour want to do on climate?</h3><p>New Prime Minister Keir Starmer has pledged to turn the U.K. into a “clean energy superpower” by doubling onshore wind, tripling solar power, and quadrupling offshore wind by 2030. He also plans to upgrade the grid to speed the rollout of clean energy projects, while at the same time denying new licenses for oil and gas exploration in the North Sea. He wants to establish a publicly owned clean energy firm and decarbonize the power sector by 2030. And he plans to reinstate the 2030 ban on new gas cars. The goals are lofty, and meeting them will “extensive change across every sector of the economy,” <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/interactive-labour-governments-in-tray-for-climate-change-energy-and-nature/#:~:text=Labour%20has%20pledged%20to%20introduce,vulnerable%20to%20foreign%20energy%20powers." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wrote</u></a> Carbon Brief. But Labour seems to be wasting little time. Days after taking power, the new government scrapped a ban on onshore wind farms that had been in place since 2015 and which the new Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves called “absurd.” </p>
<h3>Can the U.K. be a global climate leader?</h3><p>The U.K. accounts for about <a href="https://www.iea.org/countries/united-kingdom" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>1% of global greenhouse gas emissions</u></a>. That might be paltry compared to, say, the U.S. (<a href="https://www.iea.org/countries/united-states" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>13.5%</u></a>) or China (<a href="https://www.iea.org/countries/china" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>32%</u></a>), but it has a chance now to use its global influence and proximity to Europe to keep the needle moving in the right direction. That goes especially if it is nudged by the Green party, which surprised everyone by quadrupling its number of seats in Parliament (albeit to just four). As <em><em>The New York Times</em></em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/05/climate/labor-starmer-election-climate.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>noted</u></a>, Britain is where the industrial revolution began, so “the speed and scale of Britain’s energy transition is likely to be closely watched by other industrialized countries and emerging economies alike.”</p>
<h3>Are there lessons in either of these elections for the U.S.?</h3><p>What’s clear from both of these cases is that people really care about climate policy and are willing to vote with that in mind. That can swing either way, though, depending on the particular set of policies and how they affect the electorate. As extreme weather intensifies, however, it may become more difficult for far-right parties to minimize the significance of climate change. “We need to recognize that extreme weather is politicizing people against this climate denial,” <a href="https://www.outrageandoptimism.org/episodes/elections-roundup?hsLang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a> Paul Dickinson, founder of CDP, an emissions disclosure platform, and co-host of the podcast <em><em>Outrage + Optimism</em></em>. “It is the Achilles heel of the extreme right that they’re opposed to the realities of extreme weather. That’s how I think if we’re organized and disciplined, we will defeat them.” </p>

## My technology coaching and consulting in 2024

date: 2024-07-09, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog


<div class="e-content entry-content">
<p>My availability has opened up for a handful of consulting engagements in addition to my regular work as Senior Director of Technology at <a href="https://propublica.org">ProPublica</a>.</p><p><a href="https://resume.werd.io">I’ve founded two startups</a> (both based on open-source technology communities that I also founded). I’ve been a CTO, led product, and invested in early-stage startup ventures. I’ve also taught venture and product design to teams that include startups, top-tier educational institutions, and local newsrooms. My products have been used by social movements and Fortune 500 companies. <strong>I would love to help you to move faster and make stronger technology decisions.</strong></p><p>Here are some ways I might be helpful to you:</p><h3>A Sounding Board</h3><p>I can be your technology and product sounding board for your products and how your product or engineering team is run. I offer regular check-ins, or I can be available on an ad hoc, as-needed basis.</p><p>I’ll help you solve problems and coach you through getting to enduring solutions and productive work cultures. In the process, you’ll avoid common pitfalls, take advantage of a new but experienced set of eyes on your problems, and have someone in your corner when you need.</p><h3>Accelerated Technology Product Sprints</h3><p>Do you need to quickly evaluate a product idea or a way to solve problems for a customer you’ve identified? Do you need to identify that customer or market?</p><p>I can lead you through a short design sprint, either remotely or in person. At the end of it, you’ll have a stronger idea of your user and customer, learned tools for quickly running experiments and making progress, and identified and evaluated the core hypotheses that your product rests upon.</p><p><strong>You’ll iterate and get to market faster, increase your product’s chance of success, and build practices in your team to help you move faster long after we’ve finished working together.</strong></p><h3>Technical Evaluation and Advice</h3><p>Are you wondering how a technology (perhaps AI or the fediverse) might be used in your business? Do you have an idea in mind that needs to be feasibility-tested?</p><p>I’ll learn about your product and business and report on how you can leverage available technology with the time, team, and resources you have.</p><p><strong>You’ll more quickly understand what you can build, what’s technically possible, and where the technology opportunities are for your existing business.</strong></p><h3>Deck Review</h3><p>Are you presenting a strategy to your board or managers? Are you a startup going out to raise money?</p><p>I can give you actionable feedback to help you build your deck and tell a more robust story that has a better chance of getting you to the outcome you’re looking for.</p><p><strong>You’ll tell a stronger story, make a deeper emotional impact on your audience, and learn how to tell compelling stories in the future.</strong></p><h3>Courses</h3><p>Any of the above can be provided as workshops for your larger course. They are available both in-person and remotely.</p><h3>Get in Touch</h3><p>If you’re interested in these — or if <a href="https://resume.werd.io">you think you could make use of my other skills and experiences</a> — please email me directly at <a href="mailto:ben@werd.io">ben@werd.io</a> to arrange an initial meeting. I’m excited to talk to you!</p></div>

## Federal Reserve's Powell says US making 'modest' progress on inflation

date: 2024-07-09, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The U.S. Federal Reserve is making "modest" progress in its inflation fight, the head of the U.S. central bank told lawmakers Tuesday, on the first of two days of testimony in Congress.


When prices surged in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fed responded by hiking interest rates to a two-decade high as it attempts to cool down the U.S. economy and return inflation to its long-term target of two percent.


Inflation has eased significantly since it peaked in 2022, but progress stalled in the first quarter of this year, effectively putting the Fed's fight on pause.


The data in the second quarter has been more encouraging, prompting some cautious optimism from some policymakers in recent weeks.


Speaking in Washington on Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on the Senate Banking Committee that the most recent readings "have shown some modest further progress" since the first quarter of the year.


"More good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward two percent," he added, according to prepared remarks.


The Fed is widely expected to hold interest rates again when it meets to set interest rates later this month, but could begin cutting rates in September.


Futures traders have assigned a probability of more than 75% that the Fed will make its first rate cut by September.

## Saudi Aramco’s Big Bet on Combustion Engines

date: 2024-07-09, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjU1NjUwOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MzQxNjE4N30.pyefNhIUnPon5swshUfxZBcFi2fTmNrDCGewh3-wtIc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>
<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> Some Greek islands are resorting to desalinating sea water for tourists this summer as reservoirs run dry • Tokyo residents have been warned to avoid physical activity due to a risk of heatstroke • It will be 98 degrees Fahrenheit today in Washington, D.C., where Biden is hosting a NATO summit.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Oil giant invests big in internal combustion engines</h3><p>
	The world’s largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, recently invested €740 million (about $800 million) in taking a 10% stake in a company that makes internal combustion engines (ICEs), the <em>Financial Times</em> <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a3019ce4-be91-4dc8-83c5-489f18bf56cf?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--f0jV1ccwzhIdyK94g0r2nkCrShbhmpfL4Z9dIxiJLM_RrVM-kq5Y28SFnDyRpOwx49Yz_" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>, signalling that the oil giant believes these engines aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. The investment in Horse Powertrain is based on a calculation that “as the industry stops designing and developing its own combustion engines, it will start buying them from third parties,” the <em><em>FT</em></em> wrote. Aramco’s executive vice president, Yasser Mufti, told the paper he thinks ICEs will see “significant improvements” over the coming years that will make them more sustainable, but didn’t specify what those improvements might be. ICEs, of course, run on fossil fuels and spew greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Saudi Aramco last year bought lubricant brand Valvoline, which will supply all Horse engines with products. As the <em><em>FT</em></em> noted, “the venture’s success will depend on whether other carmakers are willing to put their trust in a company born out of their rivals.”

The 126-year-old bridge, which serves as an artery between the Bronx and Manhattan, swings opened to accommodate water traffic in the Harlem River. Temperatures reached 95 degrees Fahrenheit in the city yesterday, and after the bridge opened, it wouldn’t close. Authorities tried to cool the structure by spraying water on it. Eventually the bridge reopened a few hours later. Yesterday was the hottest day of the year so far in NYC, and the heat wave will last through the week.

## Houthi rebels are operating their own GuardZoo spyware

date: 2024-07-09, updated: 2024-07-09, from: The Register (UK I.T. News)

<h4>Fairly 'low budget', unsophisticated malware, say researchers, but it can collect the same data as Pegasus</h4> <p><strong>Interview</strong>  When it comes to surveillance malware, sophisticated spyware with complex capabilities tends to hog the limelight – for example NSO Group's Pegasus, which is sold to established governments. But it's actually less polished kit that you've never heard of, like GuardZoo – developed and used by Houthi rebels in Yemen – that dominates the space.…</p> <p><!--#include virtual='/data_centre/_whitepaper_textlinks_top.html' --></p>

## Who Is Auditioning for Trump’s Cabinet?

date: 2024-07-09, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjU1NDE3NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NDY5MjAwOH0.A_-lSfRA_f0iVU4z3X0ZzwnUymo4I3cpzyT4vwZguMQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	If Donald Trump moves back to Washington, D.C., in January 2025, he won’t arrive alone. Though Trump’s first term was marked by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/it-went-off-the-rails-almost-immediately-how-trumps-messy-transition-led-to-a-chaotic-presidency/2017/04/03/170ec2e8-0a96-11e7-b77c-0047d15a24e0_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a messy transition</u></a> and bouts of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/03/09/unique-incompetence-donald-trump-crisis/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>political incompetence</u></a>, Republican operatives have spent the past four years <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>putting together a plan</u></a> to hit the ground running if or when he returns — as well as a list of <a href="https://www.project2025.org/personnel/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>friendly names</u></a> for plum positions in the would-be Trump administration. Many additional Republicans have quietly (and, often, <em><em>not</em></em> so quietly) spent the past few years auditioning for these top roles, typically by signaling their willingness to continue <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/supreme-court-epa" target="_self"><u>dismantling the regulatory and administrative states</u></a>.
</p><p>
	While <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/russ-vought-schedule-f" target="_self"><u>nearly all positions</u></a> in a Trump cabinet have at least some ability to limit or eliminate climate progress, here are some names circulating for the most influential departments.
</p><h2>The Department of Energy</h2><p>
	The past is prologue when it comes to a future Trump administration, making <strong>Dan Brouillette</strong> an easy guess to head of the Department of Energy: His reappointment would mark a return to the post he left during the presidential transition in 2021.
</p><p>
	But Secretary of Energy is nothing if not a competitive position, and Brouillette isn’t treating it like he’s a shoo-in, either. Since 2023, he’s served as the president and CEO of the Edison Electric Institute, a trade association for electric utilities that has taken <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/why-eei-is-trying-to-kill-bidens-climate-rule/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a more tepid stance on climate policies</u></a> during his tenure. He’s also spent plenty of time going on TV and <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2024/01/25/eei-chief-brouillette-on-trump-climate-law-and-the-lng-fight-00137645" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>speaking</u></a> to the press against Biden’s (since overturned) <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6345650468112" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pause</u></a> in approving new export facilities for liquified natural gas — an industry <a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2021/07/15/sempra-hires-former-us-energy-secretary-under-trump/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he has history with</u></a> but that falls well outside his purview EEI. The effect is more a performance for Trump than it is any sort of service for his organization’s members. Brouillette has also repeatedly <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2024/01/republicans-unlikely-to-kill-the-ira-eei-ceo-brouillette-00137571" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>insisted</u></a> that the Trump administration won’t gut the Inflation Reduction Act, an oddly blasé attitude about legislation that has significantly <a href="https://rmi.org/what-happens-when-utilities-start-to-integrate-the-ira-into-planning/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>benefited</u></a> the utilities EEI represents.
</p><p>
<strong>Bernard McNamee, </strong>the author of the Department of Energy section of Project 2025, is another top choice for the DOE. One of the “<a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/1060100464" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>most overtly political</u></a>” people to ever be appointed to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, in the words of <em><em>E&E News</em></em>, McNamee has <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/mcnamee-im-not-anti-renewable/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a> that fossil fuels are “key to our prosperity” and that the renewable push amounts to “tyranny.” His chapter of Project 2025 calls for — among other things — closing the renewable energy offices at the DOE, eliminating energy efficiency standards for appliances, and refocusing the three National Labs run by DOE on “national security issues.”
</p><p>
	If Trump doesn’t pick <strong>Doug Burgum</strong> for vice president, there is a strong chance there could be a home for him at the DOE instead. Many see the governor of North Dakota as a <a href="https://www.kfyrtv.com/2024/04/13/senator-daines-says-north-dakota-governor-doug-burgum-would-be-great-energy-secretary-under-trump-administration/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>frontrunner</u></a> for Energy Secretary, suspicions Burgum has reinforced by cozying up to Trump as a political surrogate, even <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/05/12/trump-attacks-biden-criminal-charges-new-jersey/73660138007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>warming up</u></a> crowds at the candidate’s political rallies. While Burgum “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/climate/burgum-energy-trump-oil.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>at times [could] seem environmentally conscious</u></a>” during his gubernatorial tenure, he’s recently shifted to more familiar Republican talking points on the oil and gas industry and reportedly helped connect Trump to would-be donors in the fossil fuel sectors, according to reporting by <em><em>The New York Times</em></em>. He has also informally advised the Trump campaign on energy policy.
</p><p>
	There might also be a high-ranking position in the DOE for Texas oil and fracking magnate <strong>Harold Hamm</strong>, who was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/20/trump-considering-top-fracking-mogul-harold-hamm-as-energy-secretary-sources-tell-reuters.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reportedly</u></a> a finalist for the position back in 2016. Hamm, a conservative megadonor, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-31/oil-tycoon-hamm-cuts-trump-support-while-aiding-desantis-haley" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>briefly broke with Trump</u></a> during the Republican primary but has since returned to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/oil-executives-host-trump-fundraiser-houston-2024-05-21/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fundraise for his campaign</u></a>. Trump prizes loyalty, however, which is why Secretary Hamm might be more of a longshot; Hamm may return to being an informal advisor for the administration instead.
</p><h2>The Department of the Interior</h2><p>
	South Dakota Governor <strong>Kristi Noem</strong> seems <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/south-dakota-gov-kristi-noem-indicated-hasnt-formally-vetted-trumps-ru-rcna158448" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pretty solidly off the VP shortlist</u></a> after making national headlines for admitting in her memoir that she killed a puppy, but she may yet fill a role in the administration that is less in the public spotlight. Interior wouldn’t be so far-fetched: Noem played an active part in slashing environmental protections in her state — something that <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-debate-best-environmental-numbers" target="_self"><u>ought to endear her to Trump</u></a> — and she worked closely with Trump’s Secretary of the Interior to explore returning controversial <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-signs-moa-south-dakota-explore-future-fireworks-display-mount-rushmore" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>firework shows to Mount Rushmore</u></a>. In South Dakota, Noem also <a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-1f9c54dd230724a2e9dc15b42bf4a3ab" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rolled</u></a> the Department of Environment and Natural Resources into the Department of Agriculture and has been <a href="https://southdakotasearchlight.com/briefs/solar-for-all-but-not-south-dakota-state-one-of-six-not-applying-for-grants/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>actively hostile</u></a> to the build-out of renewable energy, going so far as to <a href="https://www.sdstandardnow.com/home/if-trump-doesnt-pick-noem-as-his-running-mate-her-poisonous-policies-could-land-her-in-his-cabinet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>refuse to apply for IRA grant money</u></a> — an action that signals her uncompromising commitment to the party’s political message to anyone watching.
</p><p>
	If not Noem, it’s possible <strong>David Bernhardt</strong> could return to the position he held under the first Trump administration. He’s used his time out of national politics to promote <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2024/04/09/david-bernhardt-biden-is-pandering-to-the-swamp-of-career-bureaucrats/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>better swamp management</u></a> (that’s the metaphorical swamp, not literal swamps, such as the critical <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/climate/trump-beaches-sand-protected-areas.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>beachfront-adjacent</u></a> wetlands he limited protections for while in office) and <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2023/05/09/trump-interior-secretary-the-monstrous-administrative-state-killing-self-government-must-be-stopped/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>to push Trump’s plan</u></a> to reinstate Schedule F — which will make it easier to fire employees that aren’t deemed loyal enough to the administration — declaring that his own agency had been “<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/ex-interior-secretary-takes-on-abortion-pills-agency-power-at-supreme-court/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>overwhelmingly liberal</u></a>” during his tenure. Bernhardt has adopted <a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/energy-policy/2023/05/09/bernhardts-bureaucracy-bomb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>skepticism of career civil </u></a><u>servants</u> as something of a pet cause, publishing a 2023 book called <em><em>You Report to Me: Accountability for the Failing Administrative State</em></em> and <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/ex-interior-secretary-takes-on-abortion-pills-agency-power-at-supreme-court/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>filing an amicus brief to the Supreme Court</u></a> earlier this year that argued, “One would be naïve not to understand how policy drives the ‘science’ at an agency.”
</p><p>
	Those familiar with Bernhardt’s thinking, though, see the former secretary as angling for a more ambitious post in a future Trump administration, such as director of the Office of Management and Budget. An OMB appointment would potentially put Bernhardt on a collision course with <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/russ-vought-schedule-f" target="_self"><u>Russ Vought</u></a>, another Schedule F proponent, which means that if the former Interior secretary’s apparent angling for a new office doesn’t pan out, he may end up back in a more familiar role.
</p><p>
	Trump’s former ambassador to Portugal, <strong>George Glass</strong>, has also been floated in the Interior conversation. An Oregon businessman, Glass fits the bill as a Westerner — since 1949, just one Interior secretary has not been a resident or native of a state west of the Mississippi. He also sees eye-to-eye with Trump <a href="https://clubofmozambique.com/news/chinese-investment-in-portugal-is-of-concern-us-ambassador/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>as a China hawk</u></a>, and while he doesn’t have much of a climate record, he has been a steady donor whose loyalty could be rewarded again with a plum administrative position.
</p><h2>The Department of Agriculture</h2><p>
	While the Department of Agriculture doesn’t have the same levers to pull as Interior or Energy, the USDA nevertheless <a href="https://civileats.com/2020/11/02/how-four-years-of-trump-reshaped-food-and-farming/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>oversees</u></a> one of the most <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sustainable-food-systems/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2020.518039/full" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>significant sources of planet-warming emissions</u></a> in the United States. While the Biden administration’s USDA has explicitly pursued an “equitable and climate-smart food and agriculture economy,” the Heritage Foundation instead wants the agency to “play a limited role” that doesn’t “hinder food production or otherwise undermine efforts to meet consumer demand.”
</p><p>
<strong>J. D. Vance</strong> has emerged as one candidate to get that job done. The <em><em>Hillbilly Elegy</em></em> author-turned-Ohio-senator previously invested in an <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-technology-us-securities-and-exchange-commission-ohio-government-politics-861dd10deeb4cdecd335abe3ad4fe775" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>agriculture startup</u></a> and has taken a particular interest in <a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/oh/columbus/news/2024/03/14/ohio-farm-bill" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the farm bill</u></a>, while at the same time boasts a <a href="https://scorecard.lcv.org/moc/jd-vance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>0% lifetime score</u></a> from the League of Conservation Voters. Vance’s name has also been <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-trump-vice-president-vance-ohio-33c2179a5ace72c742bbb3823298538b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in the hat for VP</u></a>, and he’s certainly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/jd-vance-vice-president-trump-5157007c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>done his best</u></a> to remain in Trump’s good graces, which could land him a secretary post if he doesn’t ultimately make the cut as a running mate.
</p><p>
	There might be a better case, though, that this department ends up in the hands of <strong>Sid Miller</strong>. Currently serving as the Texas Agriculture Commissioner, Miller was <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/11/trump-eyes-top-texas-maga-disciple-for-usda-chief-00151797" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reportedly</u></a> on the shortlist for the position back in 2016. He has blamed weather-related power outages in his state on renewable intermittency, at one time <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MillerForTexas/posts/we-should-never-build-another-wind-turbine-in-texas-the-experiment-failed-big-ti/3103832863172197/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>writing</u></a>, “to heck with green energy or climate change.” Miller is something of a <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2016/11/01/miller-calls-clinton-obscene-term-twitter/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>firebrand</u></a>, however, alienating even some within his own party, and he could struggle to garner the bipartisan support that will likely be necessary to win confirmation.
</p><h2>The Environmental Protection Agency</h2><p>
	Though Trump initially avoided answering a question about the climate during the first presidential debate, he had <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-trump-debate-climate-change" target="_self"><u>talking points ready</u></a> thanks to <strong>Andrew Wheeler</strong>, his former head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Trump seemingly <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/27/politics/read-biden-trump-debate-rush-transcript/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>referred</u></a> to Wheeler as one of “my top environmental people,” suggesting that in addition to being an informal adviser to the campaign, Wheeler and his work at the EPA remain in high regard with Trump himself. While in the previous administration, Wheeler notably <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/11/andrew-wheeler-epa-climate-change-bye.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>helped to roll back</u></a> over 100 clean air, water, and environmental regulations.
</p><p>
	Wheeler himself <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/holland-hart-welcomes-former-epa-head-andrew-wheeler-in-dc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has been cagey</u></a> about whether he’s auditioning for another Trump position, though — this spring, he joined the Holland & Hart law firm as a partner focused on federal affairs. If Wheeler decides to stay in the private sector, Trump might turn instead to <strong>Mandy Gunasekara</strong>, one of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/02/14/she-pushed-trump-exit-paris-climate-agreement-rollback-environmental-rules-shes-returning-epa-chief-staff/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>primary architects</u></a> of the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change and the author of the especially concerning Project 2025 chapter on the EPA.
</p><p>
	Gunasekara has bolstered the case for herself by describing how she would curtail the EPA’s powers, eliminate its enforcement office, and “update the 2009 endangerment finding” that greenhouse gases <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-08/documents/endangermentfinding_legalbasis.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>are a threat</u></a> to public health and the environment — science that has been used as the backbone for the EPA’s climate change regulations for years. Gunasekara has also <a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1192634090" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a> that while she believes in human-caused climate change, planetary warming is “overstated” and <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/the-5-quotes-you-need-to-know-from-the-ipcc-report" target="_self"><u>erroneously</u></a> claimed that scientific data shows “a mild and manageable climate change in the future.” That rhetoric puts her right <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-intro" target="_self"><u>in sync</u></a> with her potential future boss.

## Some more thoughts on TBC

date: 2024-07-09, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>I know, I know. You’re tired of hearing me ranting about The Browser Company and their Arc “browser”. I’m also tired of reading about them but I keep stumbling on news about this silly company and I can’t help myself from yelling at the screen. They aired a commercial on TV the other day, clearly a reasonable thing to do when you have a product with no revenues and no business model. And not happy with that, they released a YouTube video with the CEO explaining the ideas “hidden” in the commercial and that tells you how good at marketing these people are. If you need to release an almost 5-minute video to explain the meaning of a stupid 1-minute ad you probably need a better marketing department.</p>
<p>Anyway, leaving aside the pointlessness of this whole thing what prompted me to write this post were some of the things the CEO said in the video explainer which are so profoundly stupid that I find them offensive. If you are an ARC user you should be offended too because he must think you’re all a bunch of idiots.</p>
<p>He said in the video that there were three questions he wanted to ask:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is this internet we want to live within?</li>
<li>What if the web were truly made for you?</li>
<li>What are we here for?</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>What is this internet we want to live within? What do we want to create for ourselves?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to make it clear, what this company is allegedly making is a browser. It’s in their fucking name: The Browser Company. They’re not making a new internet. They’re not creating anything. As I wrote before, they’re not even making an actual browser like the awesome people at <a href="https://ladybird.org">Ladybird</a>. They’re building a wrapper around Chrome. This makes the CEO rant about browser monoculture even more hilarious since by doing that they're part of the problem.</p>
<p>In the video, he tries to argue that Silicon Valley companies are driven by efficiency, you type something in Google and he gives you an answer but there are times when you don’t want an answer, you want to get access to the best set of results because you’re after experiences and serendipity and a bunch of other complete nonsense. He asked, “Do we even believe in a single answer?“. The answer is no Josh. No, we don’t. This is why all search engines have a SERP. No search engine gives you one answer. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of other times something just seems really interesting to you and you want to go wide and deep and be surprised there are a lot of other things we might want to optimise for when we’re designing this new internet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Designing this new internet? You’re not designing a new internet. You’re using some algorithm to decide for me which 6 or 8 results I should be seeing. In doing that you’re worse than Google. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The second thing is what would it look like if truly the web was made for you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m gonna ask you a question Josh: how can you make a web for me without profiling me? I’ll wait for an answer the same way I’m still waiting to hear back from your support team on that ticket I opened months ago where I was asking how to prevent your stupid ARC Search from accessing my sites.</p>
<p>You asked “What does the personal web, the personal internet look like” and there are various ways to tackle this question but it certainly doesn’t look like a generated ARC Search result page that is the same for everyone. You said the web doesn’t feel personal because we all see the same stuff and yet you showed a screenshot of your stupid ARC Search pulling in results from Reddit and Trip Advisor. Again, if you’re reading this and you’re an ARC user, they must think you’re a complete idiot to believe all this stuff.</p>
<p>As for the final question, what are we here for and why am I looking at this video, well Josh, I work in tech. I code websites, I care about the web. Especially the independent, personal one. The one you’re ranting about but probably don’t care about at all. I also have to care about your stupid browser because even though it’s Chrome sometimes it has bugs that aren’t present on Chrome and so I have to test on it. I’d love to not care about your browser and your stupid ARC Search but I have to because this is the world I live in. My email is public if you want to get in touch. You probably won’t because why would you, you have nothing to gain from a private exchange after all.</p>                <hr>
                <p>Thank you for keeping RSS alive. You're awesome.</p>

## Eldorado ransomware-as-a-service gang targets Linux, Windows systems

## American mountaineer found mummified in Peru 22 years after vanishing

date: 2024-07-09, from: VOA News USA

LIMA, Peru — The preserved body of an American mountaineer — who disappeared 22 years ago while scaling a snowy peak in Peru — has been found after being exposed by climate change-induced ice melt, police said Monday.


William Stampfl was reported missing in June 2002, aged 59, when an avalanche buried his climbing party on the mountain Huascaran, which stands more than 6,700 meters (22,000 feet) high. Search and rescue efforts were fruitless.


Peruvian police said his remains were finally exposed by ice melt on the Cordillera Blanca range of the Andes.


Stampfl's body, as well as his clothes, harness and boots had been well-preserved by the cold, according to images distributed by the police.


His passport was found among his possessions in good condition, allowing police to identify the body.


The mountains of northeastern Peru, home to snowy peaks such as Huascaran and Cashan, are a favorite with mountaineers from around the world.


In May, the body of an Israeli hiker was found there nearly a month after he disappeared.


And last month, an experienced Italian mountaineer was found dead after he fell while trying to scale another Andean peak.

## Searing heat grips parts of US, causes deaths in the West

date: 2024-07-09, from: VOA News USA

death valley, california — A searing heat wave gripped large parts of the United States on Monday, with record daily high temperatures in Oregon suspected to have caused four deaths in the Portland area following a motorcyclist's death in dangerous heat over the weekend in Death Valley, California.


More than 146 million people around the U.S. were under heat alerts Monday, especially in the Western states. California, Nevada, Arizona, Oregon, Washington and Idaho on Monday were under an excessive heat warning, the National Weather Service’s highest alert, while parts of the East Coast as well as Alabama and Mississippi were under heat advisories.


The early U.S. heat wave came as the global temperature in June reached record warmth for the 13th straight month and marked the 12th straight month that the world was 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, the European climate service Copernicus said.


Dozens of locations in the West and Pacific Northwest tied or broke previous heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so into the week.


In Oregon’s Multnomah County, home to Portland, the medical examiner is investigating four suspected heat-related deaths recorded Friday, Saturday and Sunday, officials said. Three of the deaths involved county residents who were 64, 75 and 84 years old, county officials said in an email. Heat also was suspected in the death of a 33-year-old man transported to a Portland hospital from outside the county.


Portland broke daily record temperatures Friday, Saturday and Sunday and was on track to do so again on Monday with a forecast high of 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.9 Celsius), National Weather Service meteorologist Hannah Chandler-Cooley said. High temperatures were expected in Portland through Tuesday evening.


“We are looking at the potential for breaking more records,” she said.


The temperatures aren’t expected to reach as high as they did during a similar heat wave in the Pacific Northwest in 2021, which killed an estimated 600 people across Oregon, Washington and western Canada. But the duration could be problematic because many homes in the region lack air conditioning. Round-the-clock hot weather keeps people from cooling off sufficiently at night, and the issue is compounded in urban areas where concrete and pavement store heat.




Heat illness and injury are cumulative and can build over the course of a day or days, officials warn. In San Jose, California, a homeless man died last week from apparent heat-related causes, Mayor Matt Mahan reported on the social platform X, calling it “an avoidable tragedy.” San Jose police said the man's body had no obvious signs of foul play.


In eastern California's sizzling desert, a high temperature of 128 F (53.3 C) was recorded Saturday and Sunday at Death Valley National Park, where a visitor, who was not identified, died Saturday from heat exposure. Another person was hospitalized, officials said.


They were among six motorcyclists riding through the Badwater Basin area in scorching weather, the park said in a statement. The other four were treated at the scene. Emergency medical helicopters were unable to respond because the aircraft cannot generally fly safely over 120 F (48.8 C), officials said.


More extreme highs are in the near-term forecast, with a high of around 127 F (52.7 C) expected in Death Valley on Monday, and possibly 130 F (54.4 C) around midweek.


The largest national park outside Alaska, Death Valley is considered one of the most extreme environments in the world and is among the hottest during the summer. The hottest temperature ever officially recorded on Earth was 134 F (56.67 C) in July 1913 in Death Valley, though some experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130 F (54.4 C), recorded there in July 2021.


“While this is a very exciting time to experience potential world-record-setting temperatures in Death Valley, we encourage visitors to choose their activities carefully, avoiding prolonged periods of time outside an air-conditioned vehicle or building when temperatures are this high,” park Superintendent Mike Reynolds said.


Across the desert in Nevada, Las Vegas set a record high of 120 F (48.8 C) Sunday and was forecast to hit a record high of 115 F (46.1 C) Monday. The National Weather Service forecast a high of 117 F (47.2 C) in Phoenix.


People flocked Monday to the beaches around Lake Tahoe, especially Sand Harbor State Park, where the record high of 92 (33.3) set Sunday smashed the old record of 88 (31.1 ) set in 2014. For the fifth consecutive day, Sand Harbor closed its gates within 90 minutes of opening at 8 a.m. because it had reached capacity.


“It’s definitely hotter than we are used to,” Nevada State Parks spokesperson Tyler Kerver said.

## US not expecting policy change from Iran under new president

date: 2024-07-09, from: VOA News USA

washington  — The United States said Monday that it did not expect policy changes from Iran after voters elected reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian, and downplayed chances to resume dialogue.


"We have no expectation that this election will lead to a fundamental change in Iran's direction or its policies," State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters.


Miller said Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was expected to call the shots in Iran, an adversary of the United States since the 1979 Islamic revolution.


"Obviously, if the new president had the authority to make steps to curtail Iran's nuclear program, to stop funding terrorism, to stop destabilizing activities in the region, those would be steps that we would welcome," Miller said.


"But needless to say, we don't have any expectation that that's what's likely to ensue."


Asked if the United States was at least willing to reopen diplomacy with Iran after Pezeshkian's election, Miller said: "We have always said that diplomacy is the most effective way to achieve an effective, sustainable solution with regard to Iran's nuclear program."


But at the White House, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby, asked if the United States was ready to resume nuclear talks with Iran, said emphatically, "No."


"We'll see what this guy wants to get done, but we are not expecting any changes in Iranian behavior," Kirby said.


President Joe Biden took office in 2021 with hopes of returning to a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran that was negotiated under former President Barack Obama and ended by his successor, Donald Trump, who imposed sweeping sanctions on Iran.


But talks, negotiated through the European Union, broke down in part over a dispute about the extent to which the United States would remove sanctions on Iran.


Relations have deteriorated further since the October 7 attack on U.S. ally Israel by Hamas, which receives support from Iran.

## Paramount, Skydance merge, ending Redstone family reign

date: 2024-07-08, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — The entertainment giant Paramount will merge with Skydance, closing out a decades-long run by the Redstone family in Hollywood and injecting desperately needed cash into a legacy studio that has struggled to adapt to a shifting entertainment landscape. 


It also signals the rise of a new power player, David Ellison, the founder of Skydance and son of billionaire Larry Ellison, the founder of the software company Oracle. 


Shari Redstone's National Amusements has owned more than three-quarters of Paramount’s Class A voting shares through the estate of her late father, Sumner Redstone. She had battled to maintain control of the company that owns CBS, which is behind blockbuster films such as “Top Gun" and “The Godfather.” 




Just weeks after turning down a similar agreement with Skydance, however, Redstone agreed to a deal on terms that had not changed much. 


“Given the changes in the industry, we want to fortify Paramount for the future while ensuring that content remains king,” said Redstone, who is chair of Paramount Global.


The new combined company is valued at around $28 billion. In connection with the proposed transaction, which is expected to close in September 2025 pending regulatory approval, a consortium led by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital will be investing $8 billion. 


Skydance, based in Santa Monica, California, has helped produce some major  


Paramount hits in recent years, including Tom Cruise films like “Top Gun: Maverick” and installments of the “Mission Impossible” series. 




Skydance was founded in 2010 by David Ellison and it quickly formed a production partnership with Paramount that same year. If the deal is approved, Ellison will become chairman and chief executive officer of what’s being called New Paramount. 


Ellison outlined the vision for New Paramount on a conference call about the transaction Monday. In addition to doubling down on core competencies, notably with a “creative first” approach, he stressed that the company needs to transition into a “tech hybrid” to stay competitive in today's evolving media landscape. 


“You’ve watched some incredibly powerful technology companies move into the ... media space and do so very successfully,” Ellison said. He added that it was “essential” for New Paramount to chart a similar course going forward. 


That includes plans to “rebuild” the Paramount+ streaming service, Ellison noted — pointing to wider goals to expand direct-to-consumer business, such as increasing engagement time on the platform and reducing user churn. He also said that the company aims to transition to more cloud-based production and continue the use of generative artificial intelligence to boost efficiency. 


Executives also outlined further restructuring plans for New Paramount on Monday’s conference call, with chairman of RedBird Sports and Media Jeff Shell noting that they had identified some $2 billion in cost efficiencies and synergies that they'll “attempt to deliver pretty rapidly.” 


Shell and others addressed the declining growth of linear TV. Flagship linear brands will continue to represent a big chunk of the company's operations, but learning how to run this portion of business differently will be key, he said. 


Paramount’s struggles


The on-again, off-again merger arrives at a tumultuous time for Paramount, which has struggled to find its footing for years and its cable business has been hemorrhaging. In an annual shareholder meeting in early June, the company also laid out a restructuring plan that included major cost cuts. 


Leadership at Paramount was also volatile earlier this year after its CEO Bob Bakish, following several disputes with Redstone, was replaced with an “office of the C.E.O,” run by three executives. Four company directors were also replaced. 


Paramount is one of Hollywood’s oldest studios, dating back its founding in 1914 as a  distributor. Throughout its rich history, Paramount has had a hand in releasing films — from “Sunset Boulevard" and “The Godfather," to “Raiders of the Lost Ark” and “Titanic.” 


The studio also distributed several early Marvel Cinematic Universe films, including “Iron Man" and "Thor,” before the Disney acquisition. In addition to “Mission: Impossible” and “Top Gun,” Paramount’s current franchises include “Transformers,” “Star Trek” and “Jackass.” 


While Paramount has not topped the annual domestic box office charts for over a decade, the wild box office success of “Top Gun: Maverick” in 2022 (nearly $1.5 billion worldwide) was an important boon to both movie theaters and the industry’s pandemic recovery. 


Still, its theatrical output has declined somewhat in recent years. Last year it released only eight new movies and came in fifth place for overall box office at around $2 billion — behind Universal (24 films), Disney (17 films), Warner Bros. and Sony. 


Movie plans


This year the release calendar is similarly modest, especially with the absence of “Mission: Impossible 8,” which was pushed to 2025 amid the strikes. The studio has had some successes, with “Bob Marley: One Love” and “A Quiet Place: Day One,” and still to come is Ridley Scott’s “Gladiator” sequel. 


The National Association of Theatre Owners, a trade organization that represents over 35,000 screens in the U.S., said in a statement Monday that it plans to look closely at the details of the merger with an eye toward whether it will produce more or less theatrical releases. 


“We are encouraged by the commitment that David Ellison and the Skydance Media team have shown to theatrical exhibition in the past,” said Michael O’Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. “A merger that results in fewer movies being produced will not only hurt consumers and result in less revenue, but negatively impact people who work in all sectors of this great industry — creative, distribution and exhibition.”

## Biden to meet new British PM Starmer on Wednesday

date: 2024-07-08, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden will hold his first face-to-face talks with Britain's new Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the White House on Wednesday, the White House said Monday. 


Biden also will host an event Thursday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the NATO summit, which is taking place this week in Washington, national security adviser John Kirby told reporters. 


Biden plans to "underscore the importance of continuing to strengthen the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom" in his meeting with Starmer, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. 


She said the two leaders would have the opportunity to discuss U.S.-U.K. cooperation across a range of issues from Ukraine to the Israel-Hamas war, and ensuring that Iran does not obtain nuclear weapons, as well as confronting Iranian-backed Houthi threats to commercial shipping. 


The leaders also will discuss furthering cooperation in areas such as protecting advanced technologies and developing climate and clean energy solutions.

## Park benches and grandmothers: Zimbabwe's novel mental health therapy spreads overseas

date: 2024-07-08, from: VOA News USA

Harare, Zimbabwe — After her son, the family’s shining light and only breadwinner, was arrested last year, Tambudzai Tembo went into meltdown. In Zimbabwe, where clinical mental health services are scarce, her chances of getting professional help were next to zero. She contemplated suicide.


“I didn’t want to live anymore. People who saw me would think everything was OK. But inside, my head was spinning,” the 57-year-old said. “I was on my own.”


A wooden bench and an empathetic grandmother saved her.


Older people are at the center of a homegrown form of mental health therapy in Zimbabwe that is now being adopted in places like the United States.


The approach involves setting up benches in quiet, discreet corners of community clinics and in some churches, poor neighborhoods and at a university. An older woman with basic training in problem-solving therapy patiently sits there, ready to listen and engage in a one-on-one conversation.




The therapy is inspired by traditional practice in Zimbabwe in which grandmothers were the go-to people for wisdom in rough times. It had been abandoned with urbanization, the breakdown of tight-knit extended families and modern technology. Now it is proving useful again as mental health needs grow.


“Grandmothers are the custodians of local culture and wisdom. They are rooted in their communities,” said Dixon Chibanda, a psychiatry professor and founder of the initiative.


“They don’t leave, and in addition, they have an amazing ability to use what we call ‘expressed empathy’… to make people feel respected and understood.”


Last year, Chibanda was named the winner of a $150,000 prize by the U.S.-based McNulty Foundation for revolutionizing mental healthcare. Chibanda said the concept has taken root in parts of Vietnam, Botswana, Malawi, Kenya and Tanzania and is in “preliminary formative work” in London.


In New York, the city's new mental health plan launched last year says it is “drawing inspiration” from what it calls the Friendship Bench to help address risk factors such as social isolation. The orange benches are now in areas including Harlem, Brooklyn and the Bronx.


In Washington, the organization HelpAge USA is piloting the concept under the DC Grandparents for Mental Health initiative, which started in 2022 as a COVID-19 support group of people 60 and above.


So far, 20 grandmothers have been trained by a team from Friendship Bench Zimbabwe to listen, empathize and empower others to solve their problems, said Cindy Cox-Roman, the president and chief executive of HelpAge USA.


Benches will be set up at places of worship, schools and wellness centers in Washington's low-income communities with people who “have been historically marginalized and more likely to experience mental health problems,” she said.


Cox-Roman cited fear and distrust in the medical system, lack of social support and stigma as some of the factors limiting access to treatment.


“People are hurting, and a grandmother can always make you feel better,” she said.


More than one in five U.S. adults live with a mental illness, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.


“The mental health crisis is real. Where it’s a real crisis after the pandemic is that many clinicians have dropped out of the workforce,” said Dr. Jehan El-Mayoumi, who works as an expert with HelpAge USA and is a founding director of the health equity Rodham Institute at Georgetown University. She has struggled to get psychiatrists for acutely suicidal patients.




El-Mayoumi said the Zimbabwean concept provides people with “someone you can trust, open up your heart to, that you can tell your deepest secrets [and] that requires trust, so that’s what’s so wonderful about the Friendship Bench.”


The idea was born out of tragedy. Chibanda was a young psychiatrist, and one of just over 10 in Zimbabwe in 2005. One of his patients desperately wanted to see him, but she could not afford the $15 bus fare. Chibanda later learned that she had killed herself.


“I realized that I needed to have a stronger presence in the community," Chibanda said. "I realized that actually one of the most valuable resources are these grandmothers, the custodians of local culture.”


He recruited 14 grandmothers in the neighborhood near the hospital where he worked in the capital, Harare, and trained them. In Zimbabwe, they get $25 a month to help with transport and phone bills.


The network, which now partners with the health ministry and the World Health Organization, has grown to over 2,000 grandmothers across the country. Over 200,000 Zimbabweans sat on a bench to get therapy from a trained grandmother in 2023, according to the network.


Siridzayi Dzukwa, the grandmother who talked Tembo out of suicide, made a home follow-up visit on a recent day. Using a written questionnaire, she checked on Tembo’s progress. She listened as Tembo talked about how she has found a new lease on life and now sells vegetables to make ends meet.


Dzukwa has become a recognizable figure in the area. People stop to greet and thank her for helping them. Some ask for a home visit or take down her number.


“People are no longer ashamed or afraid of openly stopping us on the streets and ask us to talk,” she said. “Mental health is no longer something to be ashamed of.”

## New parents in Baltimore could get $1,000 'baby bonus' under new initiative

date: 2024-07-08, from: VOA News USA

BALTIMORE — New parents in Baltimore could receive a $1,000 “baby bonus” if voters approve a proposal that aims to help reduce childhood poverty from birth with a modest one-time cash payment. 


A group of Baltimore teachers is behind the effort. Organizers recently secured the necessary 10,000 signatures to bring the question to voters as a ballot initiative in November. Their campaign relied on extensive canvassing efforts and a cute logo: a flying cartoon stork with a bag of money in its beak. 


The proposal is loosely modeled on a program implemented this year in Flint, Michigan, where women receive $1,500 during mid-pregnancy and $500 per month for the first year after giving birth. Officials said the Flint program was the first of its kind in the U.S. 


Countries in Europe and Asia have experimented with larger cash payments, but those programs are meant to encourage more people to have more kids, not address child poverty. Italy, which has one of the world’s lowest birth rates, provides baby bonus checks and other benefits aimed at increasing the population. 


Organizers behind the Baltimore campaign say more systemic change is needed on a national level to help lift families out of poverty, but giving new parents a modest financial boost could prove an important first step. 


“If we’re going to spend a limited amount of money, where do you get the most bang for your buck? Research says at birth,” said Nate Golden, a high school math teacher who helped found the Maryland Child Alliance, which is pushing for the ballot initiative. “This could literally have a lifelong impact on a kid.” 




Golden said he also hopes the program will demonstrate to elected leaders in Baltimore and beyond that there’s a real appetite among voters for implementing policies that help vulnerable children succeed. 


The issue is particularly urgent in Baltimore, where an estimated 31% of school-aged children are experiencing poverty, according to census data. Nationally, childhood poverty fell during the pandemic thanks to federal relief programs, but it has since climbed again to about 12% in 2022. 


It’s incredibly hard for the poor to move up the economic ladder, especially among communities of color. Research shows that most American children born into the lowest income bracket will remain at roughly the same socioeconomic status for the rest of their lives. 


Golden said he sees similar scenarios playing out in his classroom every school year — with students who are experiencing homelessness, food insecurity, gun violence and countless other challenges. 


“When you see what they’re going through outside school, I’m still going to demand their best in the classroom but it’s just not enough,” he said. “We have to take care of these underlying needs before we can get kids to focus on learning.” 


If the ballot initiative is approved, all new parents in Baltimore will receive a one-time payment of at least $1,000. 


An estimated 7,000 children are born in Baltimore each year, so the program would cost about $7 million annually, which is roughly 0.16% of the city’s annual operating budget, according to supporters. The initiative won’t result in higher taxes, but it will be up to Baltimore’s City Council to allocate funds if it passes. 


Advocates say taking a blanket approach to distributing the funds ensures that no one falls through the cracks. It also means some of the money goes to affluent parents who don’t need assistance, but Golden said it’s worth including them to avoid leaving out the poorest families. 


Considering the payments are relatively small, the universal approach makes sense because researching and developing a qualification system could add significant costs and delay implementing the program, said Christina DePasquale, associate professor of economics at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. 


Above all, DePasquale said, the initiative will raise awareness about childhood poverty  


and could lead to more comprehensive changes down the road. 


“It’s worthwhile in the sense that it gets people thinking about it,” she said. “It’s something to build off of. Even if you don’t have something perfect, the less perfect version of it is better than not having it at all.” 


While no one contends that $1,000 is a life-changing amount of money, it could help cover some of the many costs that come with having a baby, including paying for diapers, formula, strollers, cribs and more. And for new parents living on society’s margins, that could make a real difference, said Nadya Dutchin, executive director of the Baltimore-based organization ShareBaby, which distributes free diapers and other baby essentials. 


“I don’t think people really pay enough attention to the material insecurities that contribute to parental stress,” she said. “If you don’t have enough money to purchase diapers to keep your child dry, safe and healthy, you’re going to be stressed and your baby is going to be stressed.” 


She said requests for supplies increased a huge amount last year amid rising inflation and stagnant wages. 


The largest federal program aimed at addressing childhood poverty is the child tax credit, which was temporarily expanded during the pandemic. Although shown to be effective, advocates say it leaves out some families because of necessary paperwork and qualification requirements.

## Hydropower Is Surging in China

date: 2024-07-08, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjU1Mzk0Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1ODU1Njg2OX0.U6pikFxhkVP1QjNh3QLVWexnMOTHcLCz4-6l9JnMREU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	It’s raining again in China. Reservoirs are filling, and the country’s massive hydropower complex is generating power at closer to normal capacity after years of drought. This could mean that China’s emissions of greenhouse gases — the largest in the world — may be peaking, or even <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/have-we-reached-peak-greenhouse-gas-emissions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">already have peaked</a>. And as goes China’s emissions, so go the world’s.
</p><p>
	Hydro generation has grown 16% through May of this year compared to January through May of last year, according to a <em>Reuters</em> analysis of Chinese government statistics. “Hydro storage is about as good as it’s ever been” in China, Alex Turnbull, an investor and energy researcher based in Singapore, told me.<strong></strong>
</p><p>
	China produces almost 30% of the world’s hydropower, but output in the country has fallen in recent years due to declines in rainfall. China produced some 1,226 terawatt hours of hydro power in 2023, according to the <a href="https://www.energyinst.org/statistical-review" target="_blank"><u>2024 Statistical Review of World Energy</u></a>, down about 5% from 1,298 in 2022 and down substantially from the recent maximum output of 1,322 in 2020. From 2013 to 2023, Chinese hydro output grew by about a third, a 3 percent annual growth rate, during that same period,  <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/wind-generation?tab=chart&country=~CHN" target="_blank"><u>wind output</u></a> has grown by over 500%. Solar output, meanwhile, increased by nearly a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/solar-energy-consumption?tab=chart&country=~CHN" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>factor of 70</u></a>.<br/>
</p><p>
	Even in spite of this phenomenal growth in wind and solar capacity, hydropower is still China’s largest source of clean energy, according to the clean energy think tank Ember, responsible for 13% of its electricity generation. Almost two-third comes from fossil fuels, largely coal.
</p><p>
	The country’s 2022 drought <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-23/worst-drought-in-decades-threatens-china-s-economic-recovery" target="_blank">wreaked havoc</a> on China’s economy, with factories going idle for want of power and cities shutting off lights in order to conserve. Globally, hydropower output hit a five-year low in 2023, according to Ember, largely on the back of China’s slump. This meant increased global coal usage, driving up overall power sector emissions by 1% and preventing what would have otherwise been a fall in global power emissions.<del></del>
</p><p>
	“The expectation with more hydro coming back on line is much less coal generation,” Jeremy Wallace, a professor of China studies at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and Heatmap contributor, told me.
</p><p>
	The water level in the Yangtze River has risen in the past few weeks <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/flood-fears-chinas-east-rain-swells-yangtze-river-levels-2024-07-03/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>due to heavy rainfall</u></a>, <em>Reuters</em> reported, which is not an unalloyed good — it could also mean more flooding and landslides throughout the summer, <a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202407/1315455.shtml" target="_blank"><u>government meteorologists projected</u></a>. Floods in the Yangtze and its tributaries are recurring and tremendous risks in China. Floods in 2011 caused by <a href="https://reliefweb.int/disaster/fl-2011-000059-chn" target="_blank">heavy rain following a drought killing around 200 people</a> and displaced <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/featured-images/heavy-rains-record-flooding-southern-china" target="_blank">hundreds of thousands</a>.  <strong></strong>
</p><p>
	China accounts for about 26% of global emissions, so if its emissions have indeed peaked, that would be very good news for the rest of the world. “China’s economy is growing and it’s using more electricity,” Wallace told me<em>,</em> “but almost all of that electricity growth has been from clean sources.”<br/>
</p><p>
	China’s carbon dioxide emissions fell slightly in March of this year after rising steadily following the end of its zero-Covid policy in 2022, according to an <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-monthly-drop-hints-that-chinas-co2-emissions-may-have-peaked-in-2023/#:~:text=The%20new%20analysis%20for%20Carbon,could%20have%20peaked%20in%202023." target="_blank">analysis for </a><em><a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-monthly-drop-hints-that-chinas-co2-emissions-may-have-peaked-in-2023/#:~:text=The%20new%20analysis%20for%20Carbon,could%20have%20peaked%20in%202023.">CarbonBrief</a></em> by Lauri Myllyvirta, a senior fellow at Asia Society Policy Institute and lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. That is due in part to the government’s investments in non-emitting energy — 423 terawatt hours per year installed in 2023 alone, “equal to the total electricity consumption of France,” per Myllyvirta’s analysis — and in other part to a transformation in its industrial balance.
</p><p>
	Over the past few years, China’s economic engine has shifted from urban construction, dependent on emissions-heavy steel and cement, towards relatively less carbon-intensive manufacturing, Wallace said.
</p><p>
	Turnbull shared a similar take. “All the sectors which comprised all the ferocious power demand growth” are “going down” or are “flat to down-ish,”  he said, referring to industrial sectors like steel. Meanwhile, “the demand side doesn’t look like it’s growing anywhere near like it is before.”
</p><p>
	“I think this is it,” Turnbull said. “This is the peak.”</p>

## US seeks to boost scrutiny on property deals near military facilities

date: 2024-07-08, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The United States plans to broaden oversight of foreigners' real estate transactions on properties close to military installations, the Treasury Department said Monday, as concerns involving Chinese land purchases grow. 


"President [Joe] Biden and I remain committed to using our strong investment screening tool to defend America's national security, including actions that protect military installations from external threats," Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. 


Under a proposed rule, more than 50 facilities will be added to a list of sites where surrounding property transactions may be reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) — taking the total figure to 227. 


CFIUS's jurisdiction covers land purchases as well. 


The concern is that a foreigner's purchase or lease of certain properties could allow them to collect intelligence or "expose national security activities" to foreign surveillance risks, the Treasury noted. 


A senior Treasury official said CFIUS's jurisdiction was "country-agnostic" and did not specify if the latest rule was aimed at quelling concerns directed at specific countries like China or Russia. 


In May, U.S. authorities announced that a Chinese-owned crypto firm was barred from using land near a strategic U.S. nuclear missile base, over national security concerns. 


MineOne Partners Limited was ordered to divest from land it bought in 2022, which sat less than a mile from Wyoming's Francis E. Warren Air Force Base — home to Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles. 


CFIUS had also raised concerns about the installation of "specialized" crypto mining equipment on the land which is "potentially capable of facilitating surveillance and espionage activities."

## 3 Takeaways From Our SunZia Investigation

date: 2024-07-08, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUwMzEzMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyNjg0MDI3NH0.hOWgyJa00K8j_57I3vbJWajbXaM-vmMIdpM5ZrIE574/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">How hard is it to build big clean-energy infrastructure in America? <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/sunzia" target="_self"><u>Look at SunZia.</u></a></p>
<p>When completed, the more-than-500-mile power line is meant to ferry electricity from a massive new wind farm in New Mexico to the booming power markets of Arizona and California. When finally built, SunZia will be the largest renewable project in the United States, if not the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>But as I detail in <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/sunzia" target="_self"><u>a recent investigation</u></a> for Heatmap, it has taken too long — much too long — to build. Nearly two decades have elapsed since a project developer first asked the federal government for permission to build SunZia.</p>
<p>Since it was first proposed, SunZia has endured seemingly endless environmental studies and lawsuits. It has been bought, sold, and bargained over. The end result is that a project first conceived in 2006 — which was expected to operate in 2013 — is now due to open in 2026. </p>
<p>That is a massive problem, because confronting climate change will require the country to build dozens of new long-distance power lines like SunZia. If the United States wants to meet its Paris Agreement goal by 2050, then it will have to triple the size of its power grid in just 26 years, according to <a href="https://netzeroamerica.princeton.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Princeton’s Net Zero America study</u></a>. (That research was led by Jesse Jenkins, who co-hosts Heatmap’s <a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-robinson-meyer-jesse-jenkins-climate-podcast" target="_self"><u>“Shift Key”</u></a> podcast with me.)</p>
<p>The country is not on track to meet that goal. <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/sunzia" target="_self"><u>My story</u></a> on SunZia set out to determine why. </p>
<p>Here are three major takeaways from my investigation:</p><h2>1. Transmission projects face more obstacles than fossil fuel projects — even in the eyes of self-described environmentalists.</h2><p>At a fundamental level, a power line and a natural gas pipeline aren’t so different: Both move a large amount of energy over a long distance.</p>
<p>Yet it is much easier to build a natural gas pipeline than a transmission line, and they face very different regulatory hurdles in America. When a company proposes a new transmission line, it must get permission from every state whose borders it plans to cross. This can result in an arduous, years-long process of application, study, and approval.</p>
<p>That same obstacle does not hinder gas developers. When a company proposes a new natural gas pipeline, it can get many of its permits handled by a single federal agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. FERC is a one-stop shop for gas pipeline developers, organizing and granting state-level permits through a streamlined process. </p>
<p>(To be sure, natural gas pipelines sometimes need permits from other federal agencies — such as the Bureau of Land Management — before they can begin construction. But transmission developers need to get<em> </em>permits from those other federal agencies, too.)</p>
<p>But not all of the obstacles are regulatory. Transmission and renewable projects simply <em><em>look </em></em>different than pipelines, which can make environmentalists and the public more skeptical of them. Even though pipelines can leak or spill, they can be buried or built closer to the ground than power lines, and therefore pose less of a visual disturbance to the landscape.</p>
<p>In recent years, much of the controversy around SunZia has focused on the San Pedro Valley, a gorgeous desert landscape northeast of Tucson, Arizona. SunZia must pass through the valley to connect to a power station near Phoenix. </p>
<p>Two Native American tribes — the Tohono O'odham Nation and the San Carlos Apache Tribe — sued to block SunZia last year. They argue that the valley has cultural value and must be preserved intact and undiminished.</p>
<p>But the valley is already home to a large natural gas pipeline, mostly — but not entirely — buried underground. (The pipeline is on pylons near Redington, Arizona, where it crosses the San Pedro River.)</p>
<p>In an interview, a leader at the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmentalist group that joined the tribes’ lawsuit, said that SunZia’s proposed power line is problematic in part because it will be so tall. </p>
<p>“There are no 200-foot large power lines going through the San Pedro Valley,” Robin Silver, the leader, told me. “The gas pipeline doesn’t have 200 foot towers.”</p>
<p>If environmentalists focus on a project’s visual prominence, then pipelines will virtually always win out over transmission lines.</p>
<p>A federal judge dismissed the tribes’ lawsuit last month. A representative of the Tohono O'odham Nation did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p><h2>2. A better relationship between conservationists and clean energy developers is possible.</h2>
<p>In permitting debates, conservationists and clean energy developers can often become enemies. Traditional conservationists seek to slow down the permitting process as much as possible and move a project away from a treasured or sensitive area, while developers and climate hawks want to build clean energy infrastructure quickly and efficiently. </p>
<p>These fights often play out as costly lawsuits over the National Environmental Policy Act, a 1970 law that requires the government to study the environmental impact of every decision that it makes. Advocates and opponents wind up battling in court over whether or not a project’s environmental impact has been sufficiently studied.</p>
<p>That’s not what happened with SunZia. Some environmentalists and traditional conservation groups, such as the Audubon Society, now praise SunZia’s process.</p>
<p>It wasn’t always that way. During the early 2010s, SunZia’s proposal to cross the Rio Grande in New Mexico was just as controversial as its San Pedro Valley route. The project’s developer wanted to build power lines near a site where tens of thousands of migratory birds, including <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Sandhill_Crane/overview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sandhill cranes</u></a>, spend the winter.</p>
<p>That changed after the Defense Department forced a major rethink of the line in 2018. Soon after that, Pattern Energy, a San Francisco-based energy developer, took over the project.</p>
<p>Pattern took a different approach than its predecessor and partnered with environmental groups to learn how it could build the power line in the least intrusive way. </p>
<p>It conducted original research on how sandhill cranes fly, and — based on that research — moved the power line to the place where it would interfere with birds the least. It also purchased and donated an old farm property and the accompanying water rights so a wildlife refuge could rebuild habitat for the birds.</p>
<p>Pattern also agreed to illuminate the transmission line with an experimental infrared system to make it more visible to birds.</p>
<p>These changes, which also allowed Pattern to avoid a Defense Department site, were so extensive that it had to apply for a new federal permit. </p>
<p>“Pattern being a company that was willing to have discussions with us in good faith — and that conversation happening before the re-permitting process — was, I think, really important,” Jon Hayes, a wildlife biologist and the executive director of Audubon Southwest, told me.</p><h2>3. But someone has to facilitate it.<br/></h2>
<p>This collaborative relationship was possible in part because it was facilitated by Senator Martin Heinrich, a Democrat who represents New Mexico.</p>
<p>Heinrich, a climate hawk and the son of a utility worker, had long championed the SunZia project. So when the project ran into obstacles, he pushed the developer, environmentalists, and the Pentagon to negotiate over a better solution. His office remained deeply involved in the process throughout the 2010s, ultimately helping to broker an agreement over the Rio Grande that all parties supported. </p><p>“I firmly believe that when we work together, we can build big things in this country,” Heinrich told me in a statement. </p>
<p>Silver, the Center for Biological Diversity leader, told me that Heinrich’s involvement is the principal reason why SunZia has been praised in New Mexico but criticized in Arizona. </p>
<p>The Grand Canyon State doesn’t have elected officials who were willing to get involved in SunZia and push for a mutually beneficial solution, he said. (For much of the 2010s, Republicans held both of the state’s Senate seats.)</p>
<p>But a project’s ultimate success cannot rest on the quality or curiosity of its senators. Martin Heinrich, as a climate solution, doesn’t scale, and not every clean energy project will have a federal chaperone.</p>
<p>What’s more, America’s existing permitting system — which is channeled through its adversarial legal system — practically discourages cooperation. It pushes developers and their opponents to pursue aggressive and expensive legal campaigns against each other. These campaigns burn huge amounts of time and millions of dollars in legal fees — money that could be spent on decarbonizing the economy.</p>
<p>In order to meet America’s climate goals, developers must build dozens of projects like SunZia, all around the country, in the years to come. That will not happen under today’s permitting system. The country needs something better.</p>

## When a job opportunity is actually a scam

date: 2024-07-08, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>You may have gotten the unsolicited texts, LinkedIn messages or other offers from scammers posing as recruiters. The may even have a legitimate-looking listing on a job hiring site. You have a virtual interview, then the recruiter starts asking for personal information like your Social Security number to fill out “employment paperwork” — but actually they’re stealing your identity. Plus, examining the Sahm Rule and use of the U.S. dollar in Lebanon.</p>

## Design and build the next version of OSNews

date: 2024-07-08, from: OS News

Despite being live since 1997, OSNews has had fairly few redesigns in the grand scheme of things. If my memory serves me correctly, we&#8217;ve had a grand total of 6 designs, and we&#8217;re currently on version 6, introduced about 5 years ago because of unpleasant reasons. It&#8217;s now 2024, and for a variety of reasons, we&#8217;re looking to work towards version 7 of our almost 30 year old website, and we need help. I have a very clear idea of what I want OSNews 7 to be like &#8211; including mockups. The general goals are making the site visually simpler, reducing our dependency on WordPress extensions, and reducing the complexity of our theme and website elements to make it a bit easier for someone like me to change small things without breaking anything. Oh and a dark mode that works. Note that we&#8217;re not looking to change backends or anything like that &#8211; WordPress will stay. If you have the WordPress, design, and developer skills to make something like this a reality, and in the process shape the visual identity of one of the oldest continuously running technology news websites in the world, send me an email.

## TasteFood: Top this easy grilled pizza with summer corn, poblano chiles

date: 2024-07-08, from: San Jose Mercury News

This pizza is inspired by Mexican street corn. It&#8217;s prepared on the grill, which not only keeps the heat outdoors, but lends crucial charred flavor to the crust. Grill the corn ears first to develop their flavor and start the charring process. When fresh corn is in season, the kernels are crisp, juicy and milky-sweet. [&#8230;]

You keep asking why your work is not enough, and I don’t know how to answer that, because it is enough to exist in the world and marvel at it. You don’t need to justify that, or earn it. You are allowed to just live. That is all most animals do.”</p></blockquote><p>I tend to read whatever the opposite of cozy science fiction is: angry and worried about the world, building tension from speculative extrapolations of what could go wrong. This, on the other hand, is science fiction that encourages you to just <em>chill</em> for a minute.</p><p>I don’t know if I could read a lot of this, because I <em>am</em> angry and worried about the world, and reading other peoples’ words along the same lines is cathartic.

Up to 15 inches of rain could fall on the region, and flooding and dangerous storm surge are expected. More than 100,000 customers are already without power. The storm is also affecting oil and gas operations: The state’s largest ports – including Corpus Christi, the top crude oil export hub in the country – <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/port-corpus-christi-closes-tropical-storm-beryl-approaches-2024-07-07/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9DlhC9ocEl0RY0ak3hDgIAmDw8S-c7InbnZuGyEhRYKLAzckQOaeLFTcC_0CvlysEfXW6B" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">halted all cargo operations</a> and some natural gas storage facilities also closed in preparation for the storm.

Conservatives have argued this amounts to politicizing investment decisions. A Texas judge refused to block the rule in 2022, citing Chevron, but now the landscape looks very different. “The trial court expressly relying on Chevron in upholding the ESG regulation ... puts this case on track to be an early harbinger of how courts will address pending cases,” said Julie Stapel, a lawyer with the firm Morgan Lewis & Bockius. The court will begin to hear arguments tomorrow. The fall of Chevron is expected to make it harder for federal agencies to regulate environmental hazards like air and water pollution.</p><h3>4.

The ban came into effect in 2015, and was part of a planning policy that required onshore wind projects to prove local communities did not object to new turbines. The new chancellor, Rachel Reeves, called the rule “absurd.” The Labour Party has pledged to double onshore wind energy by 2030 and decarbonize the power sector completely on that same time frame.</p><p>How and when Britain goes green matters on a global scale. “Britain is one of history’s major climate polluters,” as <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/05/climate/labor-starmer-election-climate.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9DlhC9ocEl0RY0ak3hDgIAmDw8S-c7InbnZuGyEhRYKLAzckQOaeLFTcC_0CvlysEfXW6B" target="_blank">explained</a>. “It’s where the Industrial Revolution began in the 18th century, giving rise to a global economy driven by coal, oil and gas and with it, the emissions of planet-heating greenhouse gases.

## Getting the most out of TWM, X11’s default window manager

date: 2024-07-08, from: OS News

Graham&#8217;s TWM page has been around for like two decades or so and still isn&#8217;t even remotely as old as TWM itself, and in 2021 they published an updated version with even more information, tips, and tricks for TWM. The Tab Window Manager finds its origins in the lat 1980s, and has been the default window manager for the X Windowing System for a long time, now, too. Yet, few people know it exists &#8211; how many people even know X has a default window manager? &#8211; and even fewer people know you can actually style it, too. OK, so TWM is fairly easy to configure but alot of people, upon seeing the default config, scream &#8216;Ugh, thats awful!&#8217; and head off to the ports tree or their distro sources in search of the latest and greatest uber desktop environment. There are some hardcore TWM fans and mimimalists however who stick around and get to liking the basic feel of TWM. Then they start to mod it and create their own custom dekstop. All part of the fun in Unix :). ↫ Graham&#8217;s TWM page I&#8217;ll admit I have never used TWM properly, and didn&#8217;t know it could be themed at all. I feel very compelled to spend some time with it now, because I&#8217;ve always liked the by-now classic design where the right-click desktop menu serves as the central location for all your interactions with the system. There are quite a few more advanced, up-to-date forks of TWM as well, but the idea of sticking to the actual default X window manager has a certain charm. I almost am too afraid to ask, because the answer on OSNews to these sorts of questions is almost always &#8220;yes&#8221; &#8211; do we have any TWM users in the audience? I&#8217;m extremely curious to find out if TWM actually has a reason to exist at this point, or if, in 2024, it&#8217;s just junk code in the X.org source repository, because I&#8217;m looking at some of these screenshots and I feel a very strong urge to give it a serious go.

## A brief summary of click-to-raise and drag-and-drop interaction on X11 and Wayland

date: 2024-07-08, from: OS News

The goal is to be able to drag an icon from a background window without immediately raising that window and obscuring the drop target window when using the click-to-focus mode. This is a barebones description of what needs to happen. It assumes familiarity with code, protocols, etc. as needed. ↫ Quod Video The articles describes how to get there using both X and Wayland, and it&#8217;s clear there&#8217;s still quite a bit of work to do. At least on my KDE Wayland setups, the way it works now is that when I click to drag an icon from a lower Dolphin window to a higher one, it brings the lower window forward, but then, when I hover for a bit over the other window, it brings it back up. Of course, this only works if the destination window remains at least partially visible, which might not always be the case. For usability&#8217;s sake, there needs to be an option to start a drag operation from one window to the next without altering the Z-order.

## Review of prescribed fires finds gaps in key areas as US Forest Service looks to improve safety

date: 2024-07-08, from: VOA News USA

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Two years after the U.S. Forest Service sparked what would become the largest and most destructive wildfire in New Mexico’s recorded history, independent investigators say there are gaps that need to be addressed if the agency is to be successful at using prescribed fire as a tool to reduce risk amid climate change.  


The investigation by the Government Accountability Office was requested by U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández after communities in her district were ravaged in 2022 by the Hermit's Peak-Calf Canyon Fire.  


The congresswoman wanted to know what factors the Forest Service had identified as contributing to the escape of prescribed fires over the last decade and whether the agency was following through with reforms promised after a pause and review of its prescribed burn program.  


The report made public Monday notes there were 43 escapes documented between 2012 and 2021 out of 50,000 prescribed fire projects. That included blazes in national forests in more than a dozen states, from the California-Nevada border to Utah, New Mexico, Idaho, North Carolina and Arkansas.  


With the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies tapping into federal infrastructure and inflation reduction funding to boost the number of prescribed burn operations over the next 10 years, Leger Fernández said it's more important than ever to ensure they are doing it safely.  


The congresswoman was visiting northern New Mexico over recent days, appreciating how things have greened up with summer rains. But the forests are still tinder boxes, she said.  


“We need to address our forest, but we need to do it in a responsible way," she told The Associated Press. "When you play with fire, there is no margin for error.” 




 


The Forest Service ignites about 4,500 prescribed fires each year, reducing fuels on about 1.3 million acres. It's part of a multi-billion dollar cleanup of forests choked with dead trees and undergrowth.  


There have been mixed results as federal land managers have fallen behind on some projects and skipped over some highly at-risk communities to work in less threatened ones, according to a 2023 AP review of data, public records and congressional testimony.  


However, the Forest Service said in a response to the GAO that it is making progress and generally agrees with the findings made public Monday. Forest Service Chief Randy Moore wrote that his agency will create and implement a corrective action plan to address the gaps.  


Moore also noted 2023 marked a record year for treatments of hazardous fuels on forest lands and his agency was on track to offer more training to build up crews who can specialize in prescribed burn operations.  




“The agency is using every tool available to reduce wildfire risk at a pace and scale which will make a difference within our current means,” Moore wrote.  


The GAO reviewed volumes of documents over several months, interviewed forest officials and made site visits over many months. The investigation found the Forest Service has taken steps toward implementing several immediate recommended changes following the Hermit's Peak-Calf Canyon Fire. That included developing a national strategy for mobilizing resources for prescribed fire projects.  


There were dozens of other actions the agency identified as part of its 2022 review, but the GAO found “important gaps remain” as the Forest Service hasn't determined the extent to which it will implement the remaining actions, including how or when.  


The GAO is recommending the Forest Service develop a plan for implementing the reforms, set goals, establish a way to measure progress and ensure it has enough resources dedicated to day-to-day management of the reform effort. It also pointed out that the Forest Service in agency documents recognized the reforms will require major changes to practices and culture.  


Leger Fernández said she hopes change will come quickly because wildfires are becoming more expensive and more dangerous.  


“They are killer fires now. They move very fast, and people cannot get out of the way fast enough,” she said. “And I think that kind of massive emergency that they are will lead to faster change than you might normally see in a large federal bureaucracy.”

## Build Clean Energy on Dirty Land, These Researchers Say

Despite authorizing billions of dollars to subsidize renewable energy development through the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Biden administration remains off track to reach its target of <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-05/DOE%20-%20100%25%20Clean%20Electricity%20-%20Final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>100% clean electricity by 2035</u></a>. Even after a banner year in which domestic investment hit <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/global-clean-energy-investment-jumps-17-hits-1-8-trillion-in-2023-according-to-bloombergnef-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$303 billion</u></a> and the US added <a href="https://repeatproject.org/docs/Clean_Investment_in_2023_02-21-24.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>32.3 gigawatts of new clean electricity capacity</u></a>, the country is still building renewable energy at only <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/publication/reaching-90-percent-clean-electricity-in-the-us-by-2035/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>half the rate that is needed</u></a>.</p>
<p>Among the barriers holding up clean energy deployment, local opposition looms large. As developers seek out new sites on which to build wind and solar, they are repeatedly <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/23022024/community-opposition-and-grid-challenges-slow-pace-of-renewable-efforts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>finding themselves at odds</u></a> with neighbors who object to their projects on aesthetic, economic, or political grounds. Whether through <a href="https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1201&context=sabin_climate_change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>formal laws</u></a> or protracted permitting processes, these objections have begun to have a noticeable effect on the pace of renewable energy adoption. In a <a href="https://emp.lbl.gov/news/larg-e-scale-wind-and-solar" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recent survey</u></a> by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, wind and solar developers reported seeing roughly a third of their siting applications canceled over the five years prior, with two of the most common reasons being “community opposition” and “local ordinances or zoning.” </p>
<p>But what if the solution to this impasse has been hiding in plain sight — or more accurately, behind a chain link fence? </p>
<p>The U.S. has around <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032113006199#:~:text=It%20is%20estimated%20that%20about,7.3%20TWh%20from%20landfill%20gas." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>270 million acres</u></a> of so-called “marginal land,” a designation that includes retired mines, closed landfills, former industrial facilities, brownfield sites, and depleted or unproductive farmland. That’s around twice the land area that would be required for a renewables-and-nuclear-only power grid, the most land-intensive net-zero scenario <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy22osti/81644.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>modeled by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory</u></a>. These neglected properties are more than just an eyesore for neighbors — they also represent wasted prospects for economic development, and in many cases pose a contamination risk to the local environment. To law professors <a href="https://michigan.law.umich.edu/faculty-and-scholarship/our-faculty/alexandra-klass" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Alexandra Klass</u></a> and <a href="https://iee.psu.edu/people/hannah-wiseman" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Hannah Wiseman</u></a>, however, they are an opportunity in disguise. </p>
<p>In their <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4747870" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>new paper</u></a>, forthcoming in the <em><em>Minnesota Law Review</em></em>, Klass and Wiseman (of the University of Michigan and Penn State, respectively) propose directing the bulk of new clean energy development to these marginal lands. It’s a concept they call “repurposed energy,” and it offers a way to, in one fell swoop, avert local objections, reclaim unproductive land, and create new opportunities for economically dislocated communities. </p>
<p>It’s not a new concept — since 2008, the Environmental Protection Agency’s <a href="https://www.epa.gov/re-powering" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>RE-Powering America’s Land Initiative</u></a> has offered funding to developers looking to build renewable energy on potentially contaminated land. </p>
<p>What the new paper proposes, however, is a greater convergence of public benefits on this specific subset of projects, which Klass views as a down payment on societal acceptance. “If you can come up with a project that’s going to have community support, that means you can actually build it,” she told me. “And that’s worth paying a little extra money up front.”</p>
<p>Consider some of the most common objections to renewable energy siting: that it <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/offshore-wind-critics-say-farms-will-damage-shore-economies-and-ruin-ocean-views/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ruins the view</u></a>, <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/outdoors/2024/03/02/wisconsin-prairie-chickens-threatened-by-proposed-solar-farm-along-buena-vista-state-wildlife-area/72803144007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>disrupts habitats</u></a>, or <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/solar-capacity-grows-some-americas-most-productive-farmland-is-risk-2024-04-27/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>occupies valuable farmland</u></a>. Each would seem to carry less weight when applied to, say, an abandoned mine instead of a pristine coastline. Throw in low purchase prices, pre-existing transmission lines at retired coal or gas power plants, and the chance to direct jobs and revenue to low-income communities (where contaminated properties are <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ej-research/epa-research-environmental-justice-and-contaminated-sites#:~:text=Low%2Dincome%2C%20tribal%2C%20indigenous,increased%20exposures%20to%20environmental%20hazards." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>disproportionately located</u></a>), and you’ve got, in theory, an attractive site for a solar or wind farm. </p>
<p>In spite of these upsides, practical examples of repurposed energy remain few and far between. Only 0.7% of the renewable energy capacity installed in the United States since 1997 has been on reclaimed land, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/re-powering" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according to EPA data</u></a>. That’s because, faced with the possibility of extravagant cleanup costs and liability for prior contamination, most developers prefer to take their chances with a greenfield. </p>
<p>Klass and Wiseman propose a set of policy changes that could, they hope, spur a renewable energy renaissance on marginal lands. First, there are some existing incentives for repurposed energy they propose expanding. Certain state funding programs – like Massachusetts’ SMART Program – and streamlined permitting processes – like New York’s Build-Ready Program – could offer a template for other states seeking to accelerate redevelopment of their own brownfields. Layering more such benefits on top of federal funding opportunities like the IRA’s Energy Infrastructure and Reinvestment Program, they contend, could help stimulate broader interest from developers. </p>
<p>Second, they offer a set of new, more ambitious reforms to entice clean energy companies onto marginal lands. Among them: </p>
<ul><li>Giving the Department of Energy direct permitting authority over repurposed energy would require an act of Congress, but could accelerate approvals. Klass and Wiseman point out that many sites containing hazardous chemicals may already be in the federal regulatory sphere.</li><li>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission could direct regional transmission organizations to grant repurposed energy projects priority in interconnection queues, bypassing a lengthy part of the development timeline.</li><li>State offices that oversee brownfield cleanup and development could establish separate divisions for repurposed energy, better equipping them to deal with and resolve clean energy developers’ unique needs. </li></ul>
<p>Klass sees the paper as a timely contribution at a critical juncture for the renewable energy industry. “We’re at an important moment in time where there’s a lot of federal funding available,” she told me. “But we are not on track to build the amount of clean energy we need to meet our targets.” By focusing support on repurposed energy, she thinks policymakers may be able to erode some of the sociopolitical barriers holding back the industry. </p>
<p>There is evidence to support this belief. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214629620304485" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2021 study</u></a> found that objections to wind farms tended to fade when the infrastructure was sited in areas with fewer lakes, hills, or other features of aesthetic or recreational value, suggesting that plants sited on already-disturbed land might indeed arouse less opposition. “You start with these types of projects that we hope will engender less community opposition and provide more community benefits,” Klass said. “Maybe you scale it up later, maybe you don’t. But it allows a pathway through some of this local opposition.” </p>
<p>It’s a view that resonates in the industry, although that doesn’t make this kind of development easy. Jonathan Mancini is the senior vice president of solar project development at <a href="https://www.ameresco.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Ameresco</u></a>, which has built solar on around 20 landfills across the United States. He told me that sites with soil contamination are capped with an impermeable barrier to prevent the hazardous material from spreading, and building a solar farm on top requires using bespoke racking systems that won’t penetrate that cap. On top of that, would-be developers have to employ third-party engineers to monitor the cap’s integrity and undergo additional reviews by state regulators to ensure that the weight of the solar system will not damage it. “Currently, the permitting timeline for such projects takes up to three years to complete,” he told me.</p>
<p>Dedicated state support in places like Massachusetts, Illinois, and Maryland has helped Ameresco alleviate some of the costs. “Utility programs or state administered programs do incentivize the use of these types of projects,” Mancini said. But he noted that more support would be helpful to overcome the barriers repurposed energy projects face. “Additional policy measures at the local and/or state level would make these projects move faster through permitting and approval.” </p>
<p>Michael Gerrard, the founder of Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law and one of the country’s foremost environmental lawyers, thinks the idea could accelerate clean energy deployment. “Local opposition is one of the most important impediments [to renewable energy],” he pointed out to me. By undercutting aesthetic and land use concerns, repurposed energy could “have a very positive impact finding ways to reduce that,” he said.</p>
<p>Gerrard also noted, however, that local opposition is not the only barrier to renewable energy development. In addition to more stringent permitting requirements, “transmission, interest rates, supply chains, local content restrictions, workforce shortages — all of those are impediments,” he said. Repurposed energy is no magic bullet, he added, but it doesn’t have to be. “We need a lot of magic buckshot,” he said, “and this article proposes quite a few pellets.”</p>

## NATO chief: Quickest way to end Ukraine war is to lose it; but won’t bring peace

date: 2024-07-08, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — As NATO prepares to convene on Tuesday a three-day summit in Washington to celebrate its 75th birthday, the alliance is reinforcing its support for Ukraine in the ongoing war with Russia.


During a news conference with a handful of reporters Sunday previewing the summit, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said all NATO members want peace, and that can be achieved if Russian President Vladimir Putin understands he cannot win on the battlefield.


“The quickest way to end this war is to lose the war,” he said. “But that that will not bring peace. That will bring occupation.”


Stoltenberg outlined key measures NATO would take, including the establishment of a dedicated command in Germany, enhanced financial and military aid, and bilateral security agreements.


Stoltenberg emphasized these initiatives while addressing the complexities of Ukraine's potential NATO membership and the alliance's united front against Russian aggression.


The precise language of the final agreement of the summit regarding Ukraine’s NATO membership is still under negotiation, he said.


In April, Stoltenberg said the alliance did not expect to offer Ukraine NATO membership during the summit, but rather a “bridge” to membership.


At the summit, that “bridge” will encompass five essential components:


Security assistance command: NATO is setting up a new command in Germany, with logistical hubs in Eastern Europe, to coordinate international security assistance for Ukraine. This will involve 700 personnel led by a three-star NATO general, according to Stoltenberg.


Stoltenberg said there have been differences among allies about “the approach or types of weapons Ukraine should be delivered.” Those differences create bureaucratic delays, and the goal is to make delivery faster and easier.


“This new command will have a very robust mandate, so there will be no need for consensus on each and every delivery,” he said.


Financial pledge: Since February 2022, NATO allies have provided around $43 billion annually in military support to Ukraine. The upcoming summit is expected to extend this commitment for another year, laying a foundation for future support.


Immediate weapon deliveries: Announcements on delivering more weapons and ammunition, particularly air defense systems, are anticipated at the summit to bolster Ukraine's defense.


While the secretary-general did not offer specifics, a senior U.S. official indicated that announcements can be expected from NATO allies this week regarding the provision of F-16 aircraft to Ukraine.


Bilateral security agreements: Twenty NATO allies will have signed bilateral security agreements with Ukraine by the start of the summit, offering additional security guarantees and reinforcing collaborative defense efforts.


Interoperability: Efforts are underway to align Ukrainian armed forces with NATO standards, including a joint training center in Poland and programs on military acquisitions and procurement.


Hungary won’t participate or obstruct


Stoltenberg addressed concerns about Hungary's stance on Russia's war in Ukraine and its potential to block NATO decisions.


He recounted a recent visit to Budapest, where he secured an agreement with Prime Minister Viktor Orban ensuring that Hungary will not obstruct the proposed support measures for Ukraine.


Budapest will not participate in the new NATO security assistance command for Ukraine but will fulfill its other NATO obligations and contribute to the common budget, Stoltenberg said.


The secretary general highlighted NATO's diverse engagements with Moscow even after the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.


He noted a recent conversation between U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and the Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, underscoring the routine nature of such contacts.


Stoltenberg said NATO must function cohesively in developing new defense strategies, emphasizing unity despite differing perspectives, such as those represented by leaders like Orban.


Future relationship with the US 


Stoltenberg is confident that the United States would continue to be a staunch NATO ally regardless of future election outcomes, attributing past criticisms by former president Donald Trump primarily to defense spending issues rather than NATO itself.


He emphasized that any secretary-general must be able to work with all leaders within the alliance, comparing NATO to a big family that every now and then has arguments and disagreements.


Stoltenberg recounted his experience working with presidents Barak Obama, Trump, and Joe Biden, noting that despite differing political leadership, the U.S. has remained a steadfast and committed NATO ally.

## US troops leave Niger base at Niamey

date: 2024-07-08, from: VOA News USA

Niamey, Niger  — U.S. troops have completed a withdrawal from their base in Niger's capital of Niamey and will fully depart from Agadez in the north before a Sept. 15 deadline set by the country's military rulers, both countries said Sunday.


Niger's military leaders scrapped a military cooperation deal with Washington in March, after seizing power in a July 2023 coup.


The United States had around 650 soldiers in Niger as part of anti-jihadist missions in several Sahel nations of West Africa, including a major drone base near Agadez.


"The defense ministry of Niger and the U.S. Defense Department announce that the withdrawal of American forces and equipment from the Niamey base 101 is now completed," the two countries said in a statement.


A final flight carrying U.S. troops was due to leave Niamey late Sunday.


The U.S. presence had stood at around 950 troops, and 766 soldiers have left Niger since the military ordered their departure, AFP learned at a ceremony at the base attended by Niger's army chief of staff Maman Sani Kiaou and US General Kenneth Ekman.


"American forces are now going to focus on quitting airbase 201 in Agadez," the statement said, insisting that the withdrawal would be completed by September 15 as planned.


Niger had already ordered the withdrawal of troops from France, the former colonial power and traditional security ally, and has strengthened ties with Russia which has provided instructors and equipment.


On Saturday, Germany's defense ministry also said it would end operations at its airbase in Niger by August 31 following the breakdown of talks with military leaders.


A similar shift has taken place in neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso, which are also ruled by military leaders and faced with violence from jihadist groups.

## Epistemic calibration and searching the space of truth

date: 2024-07-08, from: The Sephist blog

<p>I&rsquo;ve long been enamored by DALL-E 2’s specific flavor of visual creativity. Especially given the text-to-image AI system’s age, it seems to have an incredible command over color, light and dark, the abstract and the concrete, and the emotional resonance that their careful combination can conjure.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/dalle-2-images.jpg" alt="A 4x3 grid of diverse AI-generated artworks: abstract shapes, cosmic scenes, portraits, still life, surrealism, and landscapes, showcasing DALL-E 2&rsquo;s versatility in color, composition, and subject matter."></p>
<p><em>I picked these twelve images out of a much larger batch I generated with DALL-E 2 automatically by combining some randomly generated subjects with one of a few pre-written styles suffixes like “watercolor on canvas.”</em></p>
<p>Notice the use of shadows behind the body in the first image and the impressionistic use of color in the third image in the first row. I also love the softness of the silhouette in the top right, and the cyclops figure that seems to emerge beyond the horizon in the second row. Even in the most abstract images in this grid, the choice of color and composition result in something I would personally find not at all out of place in a gallery. There is surprising variety, creativity, and depth to these images, especially considering most of the prompts are as simple as <code>giving form to metaphor, watercolor on canvas</code> or <code>a cozy bedroom, still life composition</code>.</p>
<p>When I try to create similar kinds of images with what I believe to be the state-of-the-art text-to-image system today, Midjourney v6, here’s what I get with similar prompts.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/midjourney-images-batch-1.jpg" alt="A 4x4 grid of surreal yet highly detailed artworks: vivid abstract portraits, photorealistic hands with eyes, intricate cityscapes with cats, and lifelike sleeping figures, showcasing more intense colors, cohesive themes, and significantly higher detail than the previous collection."></p>
<p>These images are beautiful in their own right, and in their detail and realism they are impressive. I’m regularly stunned by the quality and realism in images generated by Midjourney. This isn&rsquo;t meant to be another “AI-generated images aren&rsquo;t artistic” post.</p>
<p>However, there <em>is</em> a very obvious difference in the styles of these two systems. After having generated a few hundred images from both systems, I find DALL-E 2 to be regularly:</p>
<ul>
<li>surprising and creative with its use of color and contrast;</li>
<li>usually focused on a single subject, with one or few things going on in the frame;</li>
<li>quite inventive in how it interprets ambiguous or open-ended prompts, often bringing in varied appropriate subjects on its own.</li>
</ul>
<p>By contrast, Midjourney’s images are biased towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>a lot of detail all the time, almost as if the system really wants to put every single pixel to use;</li>
<li>pretty uniform, flat use of color compared to DALL-E 2’s;</li>
<li>literal interpretations of the prompt, with a tendency to have the image always be “about” something concrete with little room for ambiguity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Though Midjourney v6 is the most capable system like this in my experience, I encounter these same stylistic biases when using any modern model from the last couple of years, like Stable Diffusion XL and its derivatives, Google’s Imagen models, or even the current version of DALL-E (DALL-E 3). This is a shame, because I really like the variety and creativity of outputs from DALL-E 2, and it seems no modern systems are capable of reproducing similar results.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also done some head-to-head comparisons, including giving Midjourney examples of images from which it could transfer the style. Though Midjourney v6 successfully copies the original image’s style, it still has the hallmark richness in detail, as well as a clear tendency towards concrete subjects like realistic human silhouettes:</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/dalle-2-midjourney-comparison.png" alt="Side-by-side comparison of two abstract watercolor-style images: DALL-E 2 on left with simpler, isolated hand shapes; Midjourney v6 on right with more complex, blended forms and richer color palette and more realistic human forms."></p>
<p>Though none of this is a scientifically rigorous study, I&rsquo;ve heard similar sentiments from other users of these systems, and observed similar “un-creative” behavior from modern language models like ChatGPT. In particular, I found <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05587">this study of distribution of outputs before and after preference tuning on Llama 2</a> models interesting, because I think they successfully quantify the bland “ChatGPT voice” and show some concrete ways that reinforcement learning has produced <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/t9svvNPNmFf5Qa3TA/mysteries-of-mode-collapse">accidental</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor">attractors</a> in the model’s output space.</p>
<p>Why does this happen?</p>
<p>There are a few major differences between DALL-E 2 and other systems that we could hypothetically point to:</p>
<ul>
<li>They’re trained on very different datasets.</li>
<li>DALL-E 2 never underwent any preference tuning, where the other models have.</li>
<li>DALL-E 2 is the only pixel-space image diffusion model still in wide use. All other models perform diffusion in a compressed latent space, which may hamper things like the diversity of color palette.</li>
</ul>
<p>After thinking about it a bit and playing with some open source models, I think there are two big things going on here.</p>
<p>The first is that <strong>humans simply prefer brighter, more colorful, more detailed images when asked to pick a “better” visual</strong> in a side-by-side comparison, even though they would not necessarily prefer a world in which every single image was so hyper-detailed and hyper-colorful. So when models are tuned to human preferences, they naturally produce these hyper-detailed, hyper-colorful sugar-pop images.</p>
<p>The second is that when a model is trained using a method with feedback loops like reinforcement learning, it tends towards “attractors”, or preferred modes in the output space, and stops being an accurate model of reality in which every concept is proportionately represented in its output space. <strong>Preference tuning tunes models away from being accurate reflections of reality</strong> into being greedy reward-seekers happy to output a boring response if it expects the boring output to be rated highly.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s investigate these ideas in more detail.</p>
<h2 id="1-are-we-comparing-outputs-or-comparing-worlds">1. Are we comparing outputs, or comparing worlds?</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever walked into an electronics store and looked at a wall full of TVs or listened to headphones on display, you’ll notice they’re all tuned to the brightest, loudest, most vibrant settings. Sometimes, the colors are so vibrant they make pictures look a bit unrealistic, with perfectly turquoise oceans and perfectly tan skin.</p>
<p>In general, when asked to compare images or music, people with untrained eyes and ears will pick the brightest images and the loudest music. Bright images create the illusion of vibrant colors and greater detail, and make other images that are less bright seem dull. Loud music has a similar effect, giving rise to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war">“loudness war”</a> on public radio where tracks compete to catch listeners&rsquo; attention by being louder than other tracks before or after it.</p>
<p>Now, we are also in a loudness war of synthetic media.</p>
<p>Another way to think about this phenomenon is as a failure to align <em>what we are asking human labelers to compare</em> with <em>what we actually want to compare</em>.</p>
<p>When we build a preference dataset, what we should actually be asking is, “Is a world with a model trained on this dataset preferable to a world with a model trained on that dataset?” Of course, this is an intractable question to ask, because doing so would require somehow collecting human labels on every possible arrangement of a training dataset, leading to a combinatorial explosion of options. Instead, we approximate this by collecting human preference signals on each individual data point. But there’s a mismatch: just because humans prefer a more detailed image in one instance doesn&rsquo;t mean that we’d prefer a world where every single image was maximally detailed.</p>
<h2 id="2-building-attractors-out-of-world-models">2. Building attractors out of world models</h2>
<p>Preference tuning methods like RLHF and DPO are fundamentally different from the kind of supervised training that goes on during model pretraining or a “basic” fine-tuning run with labelled data, because methods like RL and DPO involve feeding the model’s output back into itself, creating a feedback loop.</p>
<p>Whenever there are feedback loops in a system, we can study its <em>dynamics</em> — over time, as we iterate towards infinity, does the system settle into some state of stability? Does it settle into a loop? Does it diverge, accelerating towards some limit?</p>
<p>In the case of systems like ChatGPT and Midjourney, these models appear to converge under feedback loops into a few <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor">attractors</a>, parts of the output space that the model has deemed reliably preferred, “safe” options. One attractor, for example, is a hyper-realistic detailed style of illustration. Another seems to be a fondness for geometric lines and transhumanist imagery when asked to generate anything abstract and vaguely positive.</p>
<p>I think recognizing this difference between base models and feedback-tuned models is important, because this kind of a preference tuning step changes what the model is doing at a fundamental level. A pretrained base model is an <strong>epistemically calibrated world model</strong>. It’s <strong>epistemically calibrated</strong>, meaning its output probabilities exactly mirror frequency of concepts and styles present in its training dataset. If 2% of all photos of waterfalls also have rainbows, exactly 2% of photos of waterfalls the model generates will have rainbows. It’s also a <strong>world model</strong>, in the sense that what results from pretraining is a probabilistic model of observations of the world (its training dataset). Anything we can find in the training dataset, we can also expect to find in the model’s output space.</p>
<p>Once we subject the model to preference tuning, however, the model transforms into something very different, a function that greedily and cleverly finds a way to interpret every input into a version of the request that includes elements it knows is most likely to result in a positive rating from a reviewer. Within the constraints of a given input, a model that’s undergone RLHF is no longer an accurate world model, but a function whose sole job is to find a way to render a version of the output that’s super detailed, very colorful, extremely polite, or whatever else the model has learned will please the recipient of its output. These reliably-rewarded concepts become attractors in the model’s output space. See also the apocryphal story about OpenAI’s model optimized for positive outputs, resulting in <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/t9svvNPNmFf5Qa3TA/mysteries-of-mode-collapse#Inescapable_wedding_parties">inescapable wedding parties</a>.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s most effective tools for producing useful, obedient models irreversibly take away something quite valuable that base models have by construction: its epistemic calibration to the world it was trained on.</p>
<h2 id="interpretable-models-enable-useful-ai-without-mode-collapse">Interpretable models enable useful AI without mode collapse</h2>
<p>Though I find any individual output from ChatGPT or Midjourney useful and sometimes even beautiful, I can’t really say the same about the possibility space of outputs from these models at large. In tuning these models to our pointwise preferences, it feels like we lost the variety and creativity that enable these models to yield surprising and tasteful outputs.</p>
<p>Maybe there’s a way to build useful AI systems without the downsides of mode collapse.</p>
<p>Preference tuning is necessary today because of the way we currently interact with these AI systems, as black boxes which take human input and produce some output. To bend these black boxes to our will, we must reprogram their internals to want to yield output we prefer.</p>
<p>But there’s another growing paradigm for interacting with AI systems, one where we <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/prism">directly manipulate concepts within a model’s internal feature space</a> to elicit outputs we desire. Using these methods, we no longer have to subject the model to a damaging preference tuning process. We can search the model’s concept space directly for the kinds of outputs we desire and sample them directly from a base model. Want a sonnet about the future of quantum computing that’s written from the perspective of a cat? Locate those concepts within the model, activate them mechanistically, and sample the model outputs. No instructions necessary.</p>
<p>Mechanistic steering like this is still early in research, and for now we have to make do with simpler tasks like changing the topic and writing style of short sentences. But I find this approach very promising because it could give us a way to make pretrained models useful without turning them into overeager human-pleasers that fall towards an attractor at the first chance they get.</p>
<p>Furthermore, sampling directly from a model’s concept space allows us to rigorously quantify qualities like <em>diversity of output</em> that we can’t control well in currently deployed models. Want variety in your outputs? Simply expand the radius around which you’re searching in the model’s latent space.</p>
<p>This world — directly interacting with epistemically calibrated models — isn&rsquo;t incompatible with Midjourney-style hyper-realistic hyper-detailed images either. Perhaps when we have in our hands a well-understood, capable model of the world’s images we’ll find not only all the abstract images from DALL-E 2 and all the intricate illustrations from Midjourney, but an uncountable number of styles and preferences in between, as many as we have time to enumerate as we explore its vast space of knowledge.</p>
