Supreme Court boosts NRA in free speech fight with New York
official</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court gave a boost on Thursday to the
National Rifle Association in its free speech dispute with a New York
state official it accused of coercing banks and insurers to avoid doing
business with the influential gun rights advocacy group. </p>
<p>The justices, in a 9-0 decision authored by liberal Justice Sonia
Sotomayor, threw out a lower court’s ruling that dismissed the NRA’s
2018 lawsuit against Maria Vullo, a former superintendent of New York’s
Department of Financial Services. The NRA has claimed that Vullo
unlawfully retaliated against it following a mass shooting in which 17
people were killed at a high school in Parkland, Florida. </p>
<p>At issue in the dispute is whether Vullo had wielded her regulatory
power to coerce New York financial institutions into cutting ties with
the NRA in violation of protections under the U.S. Constitution’s First
Amendment against government restrictions on free speech. </p>
<p>“Ultimately, the critical takeaway is that the First Amendment
prohibits government officials from wielding their power selectively to
punish or suppress speech, directly or, as alleged here, through private
intermediaries,” Sotomayor wrote. </p>
<p>The case will now return to the lower courts for further analysis of
the NRA’s allegations under the standard articulated in the Supreme
Court’s ruling. </p>
<p>Vullo called upon banks and insurers to consider the “reputational
risks” of doing business with gun rights groups following the February
2018 Parkland shootings. In the aftermath of the Parkland rampage by a
19-year-old former student armed with an AR-15 rifle, NRA officials
lashed out at gun control advocates, arguing that Democratic elites were
politicizing the shootings to erode gun rights. </p>
<p>Vullo later fined Lloyd’s of London and two other insurers more than
$13 million for offering an NRA-endorsed product called “Carry Guard”
that Vullo’s office found was in violation of New York insurance law.
The product provided liability coverage for policyholders who caused
injuries from gunfire, even in cases involving the wrongful use of a
firearm.  </p>
<p>The insurers agreed to stop selling NRA-endorsed products that New
York considered illegal. </p>
<p>The NRA’s lawsuit, seeking unspecified monetary damages, accused
Vullo of unlawfully retaliating against the group for its
constitutionally protected gun rights advocacy by targeting it with an
“implicit censorship regime.” Its suit alleged that New York’s
“blacklisting” campaign sought to deprive the NRA of basic financial
services and threatened its advocacy work. </p>
<p>The case did not involve the Constitution’s Second Amendment right to
keep and bear arms. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in the case in March. </p>
<p>The NRA is the largest and most powerful gun rights organization in
the United States and has been instrumental in thwarting
Democratic-backed gun restrictions in the U.S. Congress. The nonprofit
group is organized under the laws of New York state, with its main
offices in Virginia. </p>
<p>A federal judge in 2021 dismissed all of the NRA’s claims apart from
two free speech counts against Vullo. The Manhattan-based 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in 2022 said those also should have been
dismissed, prompting the NRA’s Supreme Court appeal. </p>
<p>The NRA found an unlikely ally in the case in President Joe Biden’s
administration. Even though Biden has called gun violence a national
embarrassment, his administration had urged the justices to let the NRA
pursue its lawsuit.  </p>
<p>The administration argued that a lower court should determine whether
Vullo’s actions crossed the line between permissible criticism of the
NRA and coercion aimed at suppressing a disfavored viewpoint in
violation of the First Amendment protections. </p>
<p>The case was the latest to come before the Supreme Court involving
the NRA, a group closely aligned with Republicans that has opposed gun
control measures and backed pivotal lawsuits that have widened U.S. gun
rights.  </p>
<p>Americans remain deeply divided over how to address firearms violence
including mass shootings even as the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3
conservative majority, has taken an expansive view of gun rights. </p>
<p>Vullo was sued in both her official and personal capacities. But the
2nd Circuit found that Vullo would be protected from suit under the
legal defense of qualified immunity that shields officials from civil
litigation in certain circumstances. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court by the end of June is expected to issue rulings in
two gun rights cases. One involves a challenge to the legality of a
federal ban on “bump stock” devices that enable semiautomatic weapons to
fire rapidly like machine guns. The other involves a challenge to the
legality of a federal law that makes it a crime for people under
domestic violence restraining orders to have guns.</p>

sanctions Ugandan officials over graft, rights abuse claims</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Nairobi — The United States said on Thursday it was imposing
sanctions on five senior Ugandan officials over accusations of
involvement in corruption or human rights abuses.</p>
<p>Ugandan parliament speaker Anita Among was one of four officials the
US State Department said would face travel bans because of “significant
corruption”, following similar action by Britain last month.</p>
<p>Mary Goretti Kitutu and Agnes Nandutu – previously ministers
responsible for Uganda’s isolated and impoverished border region of
Karamoja – and former state minister for finance Amos Lugolobi were also
named.</p>
<p>State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement the
three had “misused public resources and diverted materials from Uganda’s
neediest communities”.</p>
<p>“All four officials abused their public positions for their personal
benefit at the expense of Ugandans,” he added.</p>
<p>In addition, Peter Elwelu, former deputy chief of the Ugandan
Peoples’ Defense Forces (UPDF), has been sanctioned “due to his
involvement in gross violations of human rights”, he said.</p>
<p>While commanding defense forces, Elwelu was involved in extrajudicial
killings committed by UPDF members, Miller said, without giving further

<p>Miller said Washington is also planning to impose visa restrictions
on multiple other Ugandan officials for “undermining the democratic
process and repressing members of marginalized or vulnerable populations
in Uganda”.</p>
<p>In April, the British government imposed travel bans and asset
freezes on Among, Kitutu and Nandutu over claims of corruption.</p>
<p>At the time the Ugandan parliament said the sanctions on Among were
based on a “false premise” and imposed because of her stance on the East
African country’s controversial anti-gay legislation adopted last

uprising</a> over its climate policies. Several major pension funds said
ahead of the meeting that they would vote to remove most of Exxon’s
board after the company sued activist shareholders pushing for stronger
emissions reduction targets. Though most of its petrochemical peers have
similar targets, the company argued that the activists’ true goal was to
“interfere with ExxonMobil’s business and to promote their own interests
over those of ExxonMobil’s shareholders.”
</p>
<p>
The resistance effort “amounted to a test of whether top fund firms
would rally to defend the small shareholders whose resolutions have put
topics like the environment and workforce diversity at the center of
many corporate annual meetings,” <em>Reuters</em> said. “Wednesday’s
results suggested the answer was no.” All 12 of Exxon’s director
nominees received between 87% and 98% support at the meeting, the
company reported. The activists, meanwhile, withdrew their proposal in
February, but Exxon is still

charging team last month. Atlanta-based charging provider EnviroSpark
Energy Solutions has hired a dozen of them, <em>E&amp;E News</em>
reported, while other charging companies have landed high-profile hires
let go by Tesla or are in talks to do so. “It does present an awesome
opportunity for other charging operators like us to fill in the gap,”
David Jankowsky, CEO of Francis Energy, told <em>E&amp;E News</em>.
There is still some trepidation, however, over how Tesla’s tribulations
could affect the broader industry’s future. Despite its poor recent
performance, Tesla still dominates the U.S. EV market, so a dip in
consumer confidence could have negative ripple effects on EV uptake.

their goal</a> of delivering $100 billion in annual climate finance to
poorer countries in 2022 — two years after their self-imposed deadline,
the group said. The 2020 target was first set at the 2009 United Nations
climate change conference in Copenhagen, and the delay in meeting it had
strained recent climate talks. Developed countries came up with $115.9
billion in climate finance in 2022,

data shows</a>, an increase of 30% from 2021. That’s the biggest
year-on-year jump so far. “Exceeding this annual commitment materially
by more than 15% is an important and symbolic achievement which goes
some way towards making up for the two-year delay, which should help
build trust,” OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said in a
statement.
</p>
<p>
Climate advocates warned, however, that achieving this aim is not an end
point in itself. Transitioning to clean energy and adapting to new
climate realities are both expensive processes. “While domestic finance,
strong policies and private finance are important, for these countries,
international public finance needs to play a lynchpin role,” Melanie
Robinson, global climate, economics and finance director at the World
Resources Institute, said in a statement. Discussions about setting a
new climate finance goal will be a centerpiece of COP29 in Azerbaijan.

<h2 id="help-identify-these-obscure-operating-systems-and-vendors">Help
identify these obscure operating systems and vendors</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Over on the GNU config-patches mailing list, Zack Weinberg is looking
for help identifying a number of ancient operating systems and vendors.
These are probably all either vendor or OS names from the late 1980s or
early 1990s. Can anyone help me fill out the following list of things
that ought to appear in testsuite/config-sub.data, if I knew what to put
in place of the question marks? ???-pc533 ???-pc533-??????-sim
???-sim-??????-ultra ???-ultra-??????-unicom ???-unicom-??????-acis
???-???-aos???-triton ???-???-sysv3???-oss ???-???-sysv3???-storm-chaos
???-???-??? ↫ Zack Weinberg One of them has already been identified –
“storm-chaos” turns out to have been added to binutils and/or maybe GCC
in 2000, and after some digging around, John Marshall found what it’s
referring to: chaos, a hobby operating system for x86 written in C. It
has a long history, and after a period of inactivity came back in 2015
with a new website. Some new releases followed, with the last one being
version 0.3.0 in 2019. It’s been silence since then. The others are
still up for grabs to be discovered. There is some talk that the pc533
one might be a misspelling of pc532, which would refer to the
“NS32K-based PC532 board running NetBSD”. This is an incredibly obscure
complete system built around the NS32532, of which only around 150 were
built in the early ’90s. However, Weinberg is hesitant to accept this
theory without more information, since there is already code to handle
the pc532, and he wants to be sure before making any changes. If there
is one place on the internet outside of the GNU mailing lists that might
be able to help Weinberg, it’s the OSNews audience. We have so many
older people reading OSNews who have been working or otherwise active in
this field for many decades, and I wouldn’t be surprised if these
cryptic names make some bells ring for some of you. If one of you does
e-mail a reply, be sure to mention this article – organic marketing to
help keep us going!</p>

the rise in artificial intelligence requires lots of data computing

official, Chinese counterpart holds talks amid effort to avert
unintended conflict</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STATE DEPARTMENT — Deputy U.S. Secretary of State Kurt Campbell is
hosting China’s Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu in Washington on
Thursday. The talks are aimed at maintaining open communication channels
to prevent miscalculations and unintended conflicts, especially during
times of tension.</p>
<p>Following two hours of face-to-face discussions, officials from the
United States and the People’s Republic of China will have a working
lunch at the State Department. Later in the afternoon, U.S. Deputy
National Security Adviser Jon Finer will continue discussions with
Ma.</p>
<p>The visit by Ma Zhaoxu follows U.S. Secretary of State Antony
Blinken’s trip to Shanghai and Beijing in April. Officials said it
builds on U.S.’s intensive diplomacy with the PRC to responsibly manage
competition in the relationship, even in areas where the two countries
disagree.  </p>
<p>“As we continue to take actions to protect our interests and values
and those of our allies and partners, we are also using face-to-face
diplomacy with the PRC to clearly and directly communicate our positions
and intentions, and make progress on bilateral, regional, and global
issues that matter to the American people and the world,” a State
Department spokesperson told VOA.  </p>
<p>A spokesperson from PRC’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Ma will
also “interact and communicate with representatives from various sectors
in the U.S.” during his visit to the U.S. from May 30 to June 2.</p>
<p>While in Beijing last month, Blinken voiced “serious concern”
regarding China’s support for Russia’s defense industry, warning Chinese
leaders that Washington could impose sanctions over the matter.</p>
<p>China has defended its approach to Russia, saying it is only engaged
in normal economic exchanges with a major trading partner. </p>
<p>Wednesday, Campbell renewed the U.S. warnings. He said Chinese
support was helping to revitalize Russia’s military capabilities,
including long-range missiles, artillery, drones and battlefield
tracking.</p>
<p>During his visit to Brussels, the State Department’s second-highest
diplomat emphasized the urgent need for European and NATO countries “to
send a collective message of concern to China about its actions, which
we view are destabilizing in the heart of Europe.”</p>
<p>The latest U.S.-China talks occur just days after China conducted a
large-scale, two-day military exercise involving 111 aircraft and 46
naval vessels around Taiwan. Washington has strongly urged Beijing to
exercise restraint and has reaffirmed the importance of maintaining
peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for China and Taiwan Mark
Lambert met virtually with PRC’s Director-General for Boundary and Ocean
Affairs Hong Liang on May 23.  During this meeting, Lambert expressed
profound concerns regarding People’s Liberation Army joint military
drills in the Taiwan Strait and around Taiwan.</p>

<h2 id="first-ukrainian-pilots-graduate-from-f-16-training-in-us">First
Ukrainian pilots graduate from F-16 training in US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>the Pentagon   — The first Ukrainian pilots have completed F-16
fighter jet training at a military base in Arizona, with others soon to
follow this summer.</p>
<p>“The first batch has graduated, and other Ukrainian pilots are
finishing their training here by the end of August,” Arizona National
Guard spokesperson Capt. Erin Hannigan told VOA.</p>
<p>The graduates include a handful of Ukrainian pilots who had trained
at Morris Air National Guard Base in Tucson, according to a U.S.
official who spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity because of security
sensitivities.</p>
<p>Out of an abundance of caution for the pilots’ safety, officials
declined to provide an exact number of how many had graduated or the
number of those who remain in F-16 training.</p>
<p>The 162nd Wing at Morris is considered the Air National Guard’s
premier F-16 training unit and houses the Air Force’s only school
dedicated to training pilots from more than 20 countries on the
fighter.</p>
<p>Kyiv pleaded for Western aircraft when Russia launched its full-scale
invasion of their country in February 2022. In August 2023, U.S.
President Joe Biden approved a plan for Western allies to send F-16s to
Ukraine once pilot training was complete.</p>
<p>Last August, Ukraine was gaining momentum in the conflict against
Russia, but that was before a monthslong delay by Congress to approve
new military assistance for Kyiv.</p>

<p>
The ability of LLMs to execute commands through plain language
(e.g. English) has enabled agentic systems that can complete a user
query by orchestrating the right set of tools
(e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04761">ToolFormer</a>,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15334">Gorilla</a>). This, along
with the recent multi-modal efforts such as the GPT-4o or Gemini-1.5
model, has expanded the realm of possibilities with AI agents. While
this is quite exciting, the large model size and computational
requirements of these models often requires their inference to be
performed on the cloud. This can create several challenges for their
widespread adoption. First and foremost, uploading data such as video,
audio, or text documents to a third party vendor on the cloud, can
result in privacy issues. Second, this requires cloud/Wi-Fi connectivity
which is not always possible. For instance, a robot deployed in the real
world may not always have a stable connection. Besides that, latency
could also be an issue as uploading large amounts of data to the cloud
and waiting for the response could slow down response time, resulting in
unacceptable time-to-solution. These challenges could be solved if we
deploy the LLM models locally at the edge.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
However, current LLMs like GPT-4o or Gemini-1.5 are too large for local
deployment. One contributing factor is that a lot of the model size ends
up memorizing general information about the world into its parametric
memory which may not be necessary for a specialized downstream
application. For instance, if you ask a general factual question from
these models like a historical event or well-known figures, they can
produce the results using their parametric memory, even without having
additional context in their prompt. However, it seems like this implicit
memorization of training data into the parametric memory is correlated
with “emergent” phenomena in LLMs such as in-context learning and
complex reasoning, which has been the driving force behind scaling the
model size.
</p>
<p>
However, this leads to an intriguing research question: <br />
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>Can a smaller language model with significantly less
parametric memory emulate such emergent ability of these larger language
models?</strong></p>
</div>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
Achieving this would significantly reduce the computational footprint of
agentic systems and thus enable efficient and privacy-preserving edge
deployment. Our study demonstrates that this is feasible for small
language models through training with specialized, high-quality data
that does not require recalling generic world knowledge.
</p>
<p>
Such a system could particularly be useful for semantic systems where
the AI agent’s role is to understand the user query in natural language
and, instead of responding with a ChatGPT-type question answer response,
orchestrate the right set of tools and APIs to accomplish the user’s
command. For example, in a Siri-like application, a user may ask a
language model to create a calendar invite with particular attendees. If
a predefined script for creating calendar items already exists, the LLM
simply needs to learn how to invoke this script with the correct input
arguments (such as attendees’ email addresses, event title, and time).
This process does not require recalling/memorization of world knowledge
from sources like Wikipedia, but rather requires reasoning and learning
to call the right functions and to correctly orchestrate them.
</p>
<p>
Our goal is to develop Small Language Models (SLM) that are capable of
complex reasoning that could be deployed securely and privately at the
edge. Here we will discuss the research directions that we are pursuing
to that end. First, we discuss how we can enable small open-source
models to perform accurate function calling, which is a key component of
agentic systems. It turns out that off-the-shelf small models have very
low function calling capabilities. We discuss how we address this by
systematically curating high-quality data for function calling, using a
specialized Mac assistant agent as our driving application. We then show
that fine-tuning the model on this high quality curated dataset, can
enable SLMs to even exceed GPT-4-Turbo’s function calling performance.
We then show that this could be further improved and made efficient
through a new Tool RAG method. Finally, we show how the final models
could be deployed efficiently at the edge with real time responses.

Teaching LLMs to do Function Calling

<img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/tiny-agent/Figure1.png" width="75%" />
<br /> <i>Figure 1: Overview of the LLMCompiler Function Calling
Planner. The Planner understands the user query and generates a sequence
of tasks with their inter-dependencies. These tasks are then dispatched
by the LLMCompiler framework to accomplish the user command. In this
example, Task $1 and $2 are fetched together to retrieve the email
addresses of Sid and Lutfi independently. After each task is performed,
the results are forwarded to Task $3 which creates the calendar event.
Before executing Task $3, LLMCompiler replaces the placeholder variables
(e.g., the variable $1 and $2 in Task $3) with actual values. </i>
</p>
<p>
As mentioned above, our main interest is applications where the AI agent
translates the user query into a sequence of function calls to complete
the tasks. In such applications, the model doesn’t need to write the
function definition itself since the functions (or APIs) are mostly
pre-defined and already available. Therefore, what the model needs to do
is to determine (i) which functions to call, (ii) the corresponding
input arguments, and (iii) the right order of calling these functions
(i.e. function orchestration) based on the required interdependency
across the function calls.
</p>
<p>
The first question is to find an effective way to equip SLMs to perform
function calling. Large models such as GPT-4 are able to perform
function calling, but how can this be achieved with open source models?
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.04511">LLMCompiler</a> is a recent
framework from our group that enables this by instructing the LLM to
output a <strong>function calling plan</strong> that includes the set of
functions that it needs to call along with the input arguments and their
dependencies (see the example in Figure 1). Once this function calling
plan is generated, we can parse it and call each function based on the
dependencies.
</p>
<p>
The critical part here is to teach the model to create this function
calling plan with the right syntax and dependency. The original
LLMCompiler paper only considered large models, such as LLaMA-2 70B,
which have complex reasoning capabilities to create the plan when
provided with sufficient instructions in their prompts. However, can
smaller models be prompted the same way to output the correct function
calling plan? Unfortunately, our experiments showed that off-the-shelf
small models such as TinyLLaMA-1.1B (or even the larger Wizard-2-7B
model) are not able to output the correct plans. The errors ranged from
problems such as using the wrong set of functions, hallucinated names,
wrong dependencies, inconsistent syntax, etc.
</p>
<p>
This is rather expected because these small models have been trained on
generic datasets and primarily targeted to achieve good accuracy on
general benchmarks which mostly test the model’s world knowledge and
general reasoning or basic instruction following capability. To address
this, we explored if fine-tuning these models on a high-quality dataset
specially curated for function calling and planning can improve the
accuracy of these small language models for a targeted task, potentially
outperforming larger models. Next, we first discuss how we generated
such a dataset, and then discuss the fine tuning approach.

<br /> <i>Figure 2: TinyAgent is an assistant that can interact with
various MacOS applications to assist the user. The commands can be given
to it through either text through a spotlight input, or through voice.
</i>
</p>
<p>
As a driving application, we consider a local agentic system for Apple’s
Macbook that solves user’s day-to-day tasks, as shown in Figure 2.
Particularly, the agent is equipped with 16 different functions that can
interact with different applications on Mac, which includes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Email</strong>: Compose a new email or reply to/forward emails
</li>
<li>
<strong>Contacts</strong>: Retrieve phone numbers or email addresses
from the contacts database
</li>
<li>
<strong>SMS</strong>: Send text messages to contact(s)
</li>
<li>
<strong>Calendar</strong>: Create calendar events with details such as
title, time, attendees, etc.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Notes</strong>: Create, open, or append content to notes in
various folders
</li>
<li>
<strong>Reminder</strong>: Set reminders for various activities and
tasks
</li>
<li>
<strong>File management</strong>: Open, read, or summarize documents in
various file paths
</li>
<li>
<strong>Zoom meetings</strong>: Schedule and organize Zoom meetings
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Predefined Apple scripts exist for each of these functions/tools, and
all that the model needs to do is to take advantage of the predefined
APIs and determine the right function calling plan to accomplish a given
task, such as in Figure 1. But as discussed previously, we need some
data for evaluating and training small language models since their
off-the-shelf function calling capability is subpar.
</p>
<p>
Creating handcrafted data with diverse function calling plans is both
challenging and not scalable. However, we can curate synthetic data
using an LLM like GPT-4-Turbo. Such an approach is becoming a common
method where a capable LLM is instructed to generate data similar to a
given set of sample examples or templates (see
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15042">LLM2LLM</a> and
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10560">Self-Instruct</a>). In our
work, we used a similar approach, but instead of providing the LLM with
generic user queries as templates, we provide it with various sets of
functions and instruct it to generate realistic user queries that
require those functions to accomplish the task, along with the
associated function calling plan and input arguments, like the example
shown in Figure 1. To verify the validity of the generated data, we
incorporated sanity checks on the function calling plan to make sure
that they form a feasible graph, and that the function names and input
argument types are correct. With this approach, we created 80K training
data, 1K validation data, and 1K testing data, with a total cost of only
~$500.

<br /> <i>Figure 3: Graph Isomorphism Success Rate. The model scores a
success rate of 1 only if the DAG of its generated plan is isomorphic to
the DAG of the ground truth plan; and 0 otherwise. In above example, for
the top case, although the order of the get_email_address calls are
different from the ground truth plan (the ground truth plan gets the
email address of Lutfi before Sid, and the generated plan gets the email
address of Sid before Lutfi), since the two DAGs are isomorphic to each
other, the plan gets 1 success rate. For the bottom case, since the
predicted DAG contains a wrong node, corresponding to a wrong function
call, the plan gets 0 success rate. </i>
</p>
<p>
With our dataset in place, we can now proceed to fine-tune off-the-shelf
SLMs to enhance their function calling capability. We started with two
base small models: TinyLlama-1.1B (instruct-32k version) and
Wizard-2-7B. For fine-tuning these models, we first need to define a
metric to evaluate their performance. Our objective is for these models
to accurately generate the right plan, which involves not only selecting
the right set of functions, but also correctly orchestrating them in the
right order. Therefore, we define a success rate metric that assigns 1
if both criteria are met, and 0 otherwise. Checking whether the model
has selected the right set function calls is straightforward. To
additionally ensure that the orchestration of these functions is
correct, we construct a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of the function
calls based on the dependencies, as shown in Figure 3, where each node
represents a function call and a directed edge from node A to B
represents their interdependency (i.e. function B can only be executed
after the execution of function A). Then we compare if this DAG is
identical to that of the ground truth plan to verify the accuracy of the
dependencies.
</p>
<p>
After defining our evaluation metric, we applied LoRA to fine-tune the
models for 3 epochs using a learning rate of 7e-5 over the 80K training
examples, and selected the best checkpoint based on validation
performance. For fine-tuning, our prompt included not only the
descriptions of the ground truth functions (i.e. functions used in the
ground truth plan) but also other irrelevant functions as negative
samples. We found the negative samples to be particularly effective for
teaching the model how to select appropriate tools for a given query,
hence improving the post-training performance. Furthermore, we also
include several in-context examples demonstrating how queries are
translated into a function calling plans. These in-context examples are
selected through a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) process based on
the user query from the data in the training dataset.
</p>
<p>
Using the above settings, we fine-tuned TinyLlama-1.1B/Wizard-2-7B
models. After fine-tuning, the 1.1B model improved the success rate from
12.71% to 78.89%, and the 7B model performance improved from 41.25% to
83.09%, which is ~4% higher than GPT-4-Turbo.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/tiny-agent/Figure4.png" width="75%" />
<br /> <i>Figure 4: Efficient Tool Selection Based on User Input. Not
all user inputs require all available tools; hence, it is imperative to
select the right set of tools to minimize the prompt size and increase
performance. In this case, the LLM only needs the functions that get
email addresses and create a calendar event in its prompt to accomplish
its task. </i>
</p>
<p>
Our primary goal is to be able to deploy the TinyAgent model locally on
a Macbook, which has limited computational and memory resources
available as compared to the GPUs that closed-source models like GPT are
deployed on. To achieve efficient performance with low latency we need
to ensure that not only the model size is small, but that the input
prompt is as concise as possible. The latter is an important contributor
to latency and computational resource consumption due to the quadratic
complexity of attention on sequence length.
</p>
<p>
The fine-tuned TinyAgent model discussed previously was fine-tuned with
the description of all available tools in its prompt. However, this is
pretty inefficient. We can significantly reduce the prompt size by only
including the description of relevant tools based on the user query. For
instance, consider the example shown in Figure 4 above, where the user
is asking to create a calendar invite with two people. In this case, the
LLM only needs the functions that get email addresses and create a
calendar event in its prompt.
</p>
<p>
To take advantage of this observation, we need to determine which
functions are required to accomplish the user’s command, which we refer
to as Tool RAG given its similarity with how Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) works. However, there is an important subtlety. If we
use a basic RAG method where we compute the embedding of the user query
and use that to retrieve the relevant tools, we get very low
performance. This is because completing a user’s query often requires
using several auxiliary tools which may be missed with a simple RAG
method if the embedding of the auxiliary tool is not similar to the user
query. For instance, the example shown in Figure 4 requires calling
get_email_address function even though the user query is just asking
about creating a calendar invitation.
</p>
<p>
This can be addressed by treating the problem as a classification of
which tools are needed. To that end, we fine-tuned a DeBERTa-v3-small
model on the training data to perform a 16-way classification as shown
in Figure 5. The user query is given as an input to this model, and then
we pass the CLS token at the end through a simple fully connected layer
of size 768x16 to transform it into a 16 dimensional vector (which is
the total size of our tools). The output of this layer is passed through
a sigmoid layer to produce the probability of selecting each tool.
During inference, we select the tools that have probably higher than
50%, and if so, we include their description in the prompt. On average
we noticed that only 3.97 tools are retrieved with a recall of 0.998,
whereas the basic RAG requires using the top 6 tools to achieve a tool
recall of 0.968.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/tiny-agent/Figure5.png" width="75%" />
<br /> <i>Figure 5: Overview of our Tool RAG scheme. We formulate tool
retrieval as a multi-label classification problem. The user query is
given as input to the fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3-small model, which outputs a
16-dimensional vector indicating tool probabilities. Tools with
probabilities higher than 50% are selected, averaging 3.97 tools per
query compared to 6 tools in basic RAG. </i>
</p>
<p>
We evaluated the model performance after incorporating Tool RAG. The
results are shown in Table 1 below, where we report the performance of
the simple RAG system along with the fine-tuned DeBERTa approach. As one
can see, the DeBERTa based Tool RAG method achieves almost perfect
recall performance, improves the baseline accuracy, while reducing the
prompt size by ~2x tokens.

Fast Edge Deployment with Quantization
</h1>
<p>
Deploying models at the edge, such as on consumer MacBooks, can still be
challenging even for small models of O(1B) parameters, since loading the
model parameters can consume a large portion of the available memory. A
solution to these issues is quantization, which allows us to store the
model at a reduced bit precision. Quantization not only reduces the
storage requirements and model footprint, but also cuts down the time
and resources needed to load model weights into memory, thereby reducing
the overall inference latency as well (see
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.13630">this</a> for more information
on quantization).
</p>
<p>
For more efficient deployment of the models, we quantized the models
into 4-bit with a group size of 32, which is supported by the llama.cpp
framework with quantization aware training. As shown in Table 2, the
4-bit models result in 30% better latency, along with a 4x reduction in
the model size. We also notice slight accuracy improvement which is due
to the additional fine-tuning with simulated quantization.

Putting it all together
</h1>
<p>
Below is the demo of the final TinyAgent-1.1B model deployed on a
Macbook Pro M3 which you can actually download and install on your Mac
and test as well. It not only runs all of the model inference locally on
your computer, but it also allows you to provide commands through audio.
We process the audio locally as well using the Whisper-v3 model from
OpenAI deployed locally using the whisper.cpp framework. The greatest
surprise for us was that the accuracy of the 1.1B model exceeds that of
GPT-4-Turbo, and is markedly fast while deployed locally and privately
on device.
</p>
<p>
To summarize, we introduced TinyAgent and showed that it is indeed
possible to train a small language model and use it to power a semantic
system that processes user queries. In particular, we considered a
Siri-like assistant for Mac as a driving application. The key components
for enabling it is to (i) teach off-the-shelf SLMs to perform function
calling through LLMCompiler framework, (ii) curate high quality function
calling data for the task at hand, (iii) fine-tune the off-the-shelf
model on the generated data, and (iv) enable efficient deployment by
optimizing the prompt size through only retrieving the necessary tools
based on the user query through a method called ToolRAG, as well as
quantized model deployment to reduce inference resource consumption.
After these steps, our final models achieved 80.06% and 84.95% for the
TinyAgent1.1.B and 7B models which exceed GPT-4-Turbo’s success rate of
79.08% on this task.

is killing off the messaging service inside Google Maps</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>Google is killing off a messaging service! This one is the odd
“Google Business Messaging” service—basically an instant messaging
client that is built into Google Maps. If you looked up a participating
business in Google Maps or Google Search on a phone, the main row of
buttons in the place card would read something like “Call,” “Chat,”
“Directions,” and “Website.” That “Chat” button is the service we’re
talking about. It would launch a full messaging interface inside the
Google Maps app, and businesses were expected to use it for customer
service purposes. Google’s deeply dysfunctional messaging strategy might
lead people to joke about a theoretical “Google Maps Messaging” service,
but it already exists and has existed for years, and now it’s being shut
down. ↫ Ron Amadeo at Ars Technica When it comes to Google, it’s often
hard to distinguish meme from reality.</p>

Media and The Atlantic sign content deals with OpenAI</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>Speaking of The Verge, its parent company Vox Media, along with The
Atlantic, have signed a deal with OpenAI. Two more media companies have
signed licensing agreements with OpenAI, allowing their content to be
used to train its AI models and be shared inside of ChatGPT. The
Atlantic and Vox Media — The Verge’s parent company — both announced
deals with OpenAI on Wednesday. ↫ Emilia David at The Verge In the case
of Vox Media, the deal was made and announced without informing their
staff, which obviously doesn’t sit well with especially Vox’ writers. By
making deals like this, upper management gets to double-dip on the
fruits of their workers’ labour – first, the published content generates
ad revenues, and second, OpenAI pays them to use said content for
training and other purposes. And once the “AI” gets good enough, more
and more of the writers will be fired, leaving only a skeleton crew of
lower-paid workers to clean up the “AI” output. With this deal, the
writing is on the wall for every journalist at Vox Media – you’re
currently contributing to your own obsolescence, and your bosses are
getting paid for it. As far as I know, OSNews’ owner, David, has not yet
been contacted by OpenAI. Regardless, I’ll sell the past 20-odd years of
my terrible takes for 69 million euros, after deducting Swedish taxes.
And since OpenAI is run by billionaires: taxes are this thing where
normal people pay a portion of their income to the government in return
for various government services. It’s wild, I know.</p>

Swiss Army Knife of Clean Energy Tax Credits Goes Into Effect Next
Year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-29, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjM1MjA4MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxODg3NzQ0MX0.T2eVHCLKHzoAtWjSnENcr1QRNuX6gSSW6_Fdd597GU4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
Before and for the first year or so after the Inflation Reduction Act,
clean energy in the United States was largely developed under the aegis
of two tax credits: the Production Tax Credit, which primarily useful
for wind power, and the Investment Tax Credit, which is primarily used
for solar power. (The actual eligibility for each tax credit for each
technology has changed
<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/solar-production-tax-credit-inflation-reduction-act/703078/" style="" target="_blank">various
times</a> over the years, but that’s the gist.)
</p>
<p>
Starting in 2025, however, and lasting (absent any change in the law)
through at least 2032, that tax credit regime will be made “technology
neutral.” Goodbye, existing credits with their limited applicability.
Hello, new tax credits that apply to “any clean energy facility that
achieves net-zero greenhouse gas emissions,” according to a
<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2376" style="" target="_blank">release</a>
issued Wednesday by the Treasury Department.<br/><br/>“For too long, the
U.S. solar and wind markets have been hampered by uncertainty due to the
on-again-off-again nature of key tax credits,” Treasury Secretary Janet
Yellen said on a call with reporters. “Periods of indecision and the
credits being repeatedly allowed to elect to lapse made it too difficult
for companies to plan and invest in clean energy projects.”
</p>
<p>
About that “at least”: The tax credits only start to phase out when
Treasury determines that electricity-related greenhouse gas emissions
have been reduced 75% from their 2022 levels <em style="">or </em>in
2032, whichever comes later, making this the rare tax code provision
with an outcome-based timeline.<strong><em></em></strong>
</p>
<p>
In preparation for the new Clean Electricity Production Credit and Clean
Electricity Investment Credit, a.k.a. sections 45Y and 48E of the U.S.
tax code, to go into effect, Treasury proposed guidance outlining what
would qualify for the tax credits and soliciting comments on forms of
power generation whose true carbon abatement potentials are more in
doubt. The notice and subsequent publication in the Federal Register
kicks off a 60-day public comment period, after which Treasury and the
Internal Revenue Service will write the final rules.
</p>
<p>
The new list of eligible technologies includes “hydropower, marine and
hydrokinetic, nuclear fission and fusion, geothermal,” along with
“certain types of waste energy recovery property” as among the
technologies that will be “categorically” eligible for the new tax
credits. The point here isn’t to create more exclusivity, but rather to
“provide clarity and certainty to developers,” Treasury said in the
release. Yellen added that, “for the first time, these incentives are
tied explicitly to electricity generation with zero emissions instead of
specific technologies.”
</p>
<p>
What this announcement does not clarify, however, is what to do about
energy sources that involve combustion, such as biomass or harnessing
methane emitted from landfills. Here is where the Treasury Department is
asking for help from outside — many of the questions included in the
proposed rulemaking are devoted to figuring out exactly how these forms
of energy might or might not be made zero-emission.
</p>
<p>
Many environmental groups
<a href="https://www.nrdc.org/press-releases/biogas-and-synthetic-gas-not-solution-polluting-natural-gas-todays-us-energy-system" target="_blank"><u>are
skeptical of any combustion-based energy sources</u></a>, and Treasury
said that generation methods which “rely on combustion or gasification
to produce electricity” will have to “undergo a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/life-cycle-analysis-study" target="_blank">lifecycle
greenhouse gas analysis</a> to demonstrate net-zero emissions.”

<p>date: 2024-05-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on
Wednesday reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to Moldova, pledging $135
million to enhance energy security and counter Russian disinformation
during his visit to Chisinau.</p>
<p>During Wednesday’s visit, Blinken announced that up to $85 million in
USAID funding will subsidize equipment to strengthen Moldova’s national
power grid and facilitate greater electricity trade with Romania,
Ukraine, and the broader European market. He also unveiled additional
aid for Moldova, a pro-Western country facing renewed threats from
Russia.</p>
<p>“Today, I’m announcing that we’ll be working with our Congress to
provide an additional $50 million to further advance these efforts from
reforming the energy and agricultural sectors to pushing back and
further against disinformation,” said Blinken during a joint press
conference with Moldova President Maia Sandu.</p>
<p>“That in turn will bolster the ability of Moldova to resist Russian
interference, to hold free and fair elections to continue down the path
to the European Union and Western integration to create more economic
opportunity,” he said.</p>
<p>Watch related report by Veronica Balderas Iglesias:</p>
<p>Blinken’s trip comes amid concerns over Russia’s military presence in
Moldova’s breakaway Transnistria region. Moldova has accused Russia of
waging a hybrid war through election interference and disinformation
campaigns aimed at toppling the government and hindering its EU
aspirations. Russia denies these accusations.</p>
<p>Sandu welcomed Blinken’s second visit in two years as “a strong sign
of support.”</p>
<p>“Through unity and with the support of our partners, we will stand by
our people and move forward,” Sandu said during the press
conference.</p>
<p>She also expressed gratitude for U.S. support to both Moldova and
Ukraine. Since Russia’s 2022 invasion, the Biden administration has
directed billions of dollars in weapons assistance to Ukraine, which
Sandu said “also makes Moldova safer and more resilient.”</p>
<p>Historically, Moldova’s heavy reliance on outside energy resources
has made the country vulnerable to external disruptions and price
fluctuations, delaying its progress toward sustainable economic
development. Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has further exacerbated
Moldova’s energy challenges by driving up electricity and gas prices and
creating sector instability.</p>
<p>Since Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the United States
has provided Moldova with $774 million in assistance, including $300
million through USAID, to support energy security.</p>
<p>NATO, Ukraine</p>
<p>After Chisinau, Blinken is heading to Prague for NATO foreign
ministers’ meetings, where “a substantial show of support for Ukraine”
is expected, according to U.S. officials.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Blinken said the U.S. is working hard to deliver more
air defenses to Ukraine as it defends itself against intensifying
Russian attacks.</p>
<p>But Blinken, along with other officials from the Biden
administration, said Washington does not encourage or enable the use of
U.S.-supplied weapons to strike inside Russia.</p>
<p>“Ukraine has to make its own decisions about the best way to
effectively defend itself,” Blinken said. ’’We’re going to make sure
that it has the equipment it needs.”</p>
<p>This week, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg urged the
alliance’s members to lift some of the restrictions on Ukraine’s use of
Western weapons, potentially enabling their use for strikes directly on
Russian soil.</p>
<p>“The right to self-defense includes hitting legitimate targets
outside Ukraine,” Stoltenberg said Monday at a NATO meeting in Sofia,
Bulgaria.</p>
<p>The United States will host a NATO summit in Washington from July 9
to July 11.</p>
<p>Blinken said there will be “very strong deliverables” in terms of
Ukraine’s further integration with the Atlantic alliance.</p>
<p>Thirty-two countries have either completed or will soon complete
bilateral security agreements with Ukraine.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-29, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti</p>
<p>With the job market getting tougher by the day, there’s a rising
belief among tech writers that their role is “too niche” and a “dead-end
job”. I think that’s the wrong way of looking at our profession — at any
profession. Let me cast aside that dark veil of pessimism and offer an
alternative viewpoint, that of tech writing as a platform to other
professions, one that lets you move laterally with just a bit of
curiosity and courage.</p>

‘Auto Super Resolution’ DLSS competitor isn’t exclusive to Qualcomm</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>When you launch a game on a Snapdragon on a Windows laptop, you might
get an AI frame rate boost from Microsoft’s mysterious Auto Super
Resolution (Auto SR) feature. But while Microsoft hasn’t fully explained
how the feature works, The Verge can now confirm it’s not Qualcomm
technology, not exclusive to Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon X chips, and not
exclusive to specific games, either. ↫ Sean Hollister at The Verge These
resolution enhancer technologies from NVIDIA, AMD, and apparently
Microsoft are another great use of what we today call “AI” technologies.
Of course, I wish we didn’t have to deal with several proprietary
offerings but instead enjoyed several open source versions and possibly
a standard to work off of, but give it some time, and we may still get
there. Like I’ve said before – there’s nothing inherently wrong with
“AI” technologies, as long as they’re used in ways that make sense, run
locally, and most importantly, aren’t based on the wholesale theft of
artists’ and programmers’ works. Unsurprisingly, the tech bros at
companies like OpenAI don’t really understand the concept of “consent”,
and until they do, their offerings should be deemed illegal.</p>

rejects calls to quit US Supreme Court cases on Trump and Jan. 6 because
of flag controversies</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Justice Samuel Alito is rejecting calls to step aside
from Supreme Court cases involving former President Donald Trump and
Jan. 6 defendants because of the controversy over flags that flew over
his homes.</p>
<p>In letters to members of Congress on Wednesday, Alito said his wife
was responsible for flying an upside-down U.S. flag over his home in
2021 and an “Appeal to Heaven” flag at his New Jersey beach house last
year.</p>
<p>Neither incident merits his recusal, he wrote.</p>
<p>“I am therefore duty-bound to reject your recusal request,” he
wrote.</p>
<p>The court is considering two major cases related to the Jan. 6, 2021,
attack by a mob of Trump supporters on the Capitol, including charges
faced by the rioters and whether Trump has immunity from prosecution on
election interference charges.</p>
<p>Alito has rejected calls from Democrats in the past to recuse on
other issues.</p>
<p>The New York Times reported that an inverted American flag was seen
at Alito’s home in Alexandria, Virginia, less than two weeks after the
attack on the Capitol. The paper also reported that an “Appeal to
Heaven” flag was flown outside of the justice’s beach home in New Jersey
last summer. Both flags were carried by rioters who violently stormed
the Capitol in January 2021 echoing Trump’s false claims of election
fraud.</p>
<p>Alito said he was unaware that the upside-down flag was flying above
his house until it was called to his attention. “As soon as I saw it, I
asked my wife to take it down, but for several days, she refused,” he
wrote in nearly identical letters to Democrats in the House and
Senate.</p>

a Natural Gas-Powered Bitcoin Miner Became a Darling of Climate
Tech</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-29, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Categorizing <a href="https://crusoe.ai/" target="_blank">Crusoe
Energy</a> is not easy. The startup is a Bitcoin miner and data center
operator. It’s a “high-performance” and “carbon-negative” cloud platform
provider. It’s a darling of the clean tech world that’s raised nearly
$750 million in funding. The company has historically powered its
operations with natural gas, but its overall business model actually
reduces emissions. Confused yet?
</p>
<p>
Here are the basics. The company was founded in 2018 to address the
problem of natural gas flaring. Natural gas is a byproduct of oil
extraction, and if oil field operators have no economical use case for
the gas or are unable to transfer it elsewhere, it’s often simply
burned. If you, like me, have spent time
<a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/search/2/image?phrase=natural%20gas%20flaring&sort=mostpopular&license=rf%2Crm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sourcing
stock images</u></a> of air pollution, you’ve probably seen the pictures
of giant flames coming out of tall smokestacks near oil pump jacks and
other drilling infrastructure. That’s what flaring natural gas looks
like, and it is indeed terrible for the environment. That’s largely
because the process fails to fully combust methane, which is the primary
component of natural gas and 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide
over a 20-year period.
</p>
<p>
That’s where Crusoe comes in. The company’s co-founder, president, and
chief operating officer, Cully Cavness was working in the oil and gas
industry when he realized that stranded natural gas could be harnessed
to power Bitcoin-mining data centers if they were sited directly next to
the oil field infrastructure. Burning natural gas for electricity
production fully combusts methane, producing CO2 as a byproduct. Still
bad, you might say! But it’s definitely not as bad as methane leaking
into the atmosphere via flaring, the status quo where Crusoe operates.
</p>
<p>
So regardless of what one might think of the utility of Bitcoin mining
overall, “if you were to delete what we’re doing you would just have a
big ball of fire and that would be worse,” Cavness told me.
</p>
<p>
Plus, it’s dirt cheap. “It is the lowest cost way to generate power that
we’ve ever seen,” Cavness said, though he wouldn’t disclose exactly how
much Crusoe pays the oil companies for their natural gas. “This is truly
a waste product. I mean, there is no value being ascribed to it.”
</p>
<p>
According to Crusoe’s
<a href="https://crusoe.ai/_astro/Crusoe_ESG_Report_2023.05.10.b68a7533.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>most
recent ESG report</u></a>, for every ton of CO2 equivalent that the
company produced in 2022, it reduced over 1.6 tons through avoided
methane emissions. And the opportunity for growth is enormous. “There is
a huge amount of flared gas around the world,” Cavness said. “If you
captured it all, it would power like two thirds of all of Europe’s
electricity and it would power the entire data center industry many
times over.”
</p>
<p>
Of course, in an ideal world, flared gas wouldn’t even be an option.
There have been some state level-efforts to ban “routine flaring” in
Colorado, New Mexico, and Alaska, but
<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/12032023/new-mexico-methane-gas-flaring/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>enforcement
has often fallen short</u></a>. “Nothing about flaring should be
routine,” Deborah Gordon, a methane expert at the think tank RMI, told
me. “It should be an emergency piece of equipment. It’s there to handle
a burst of gas that would otherwise present a safety problem to the
people on the ground.”
</p>
<p>
But in the places where Crusoe operates, Cavness said flare gas is
available 98% to 99% of the time. Today, the company has about 30 sites
located throughout all the major oil fields in the U.S., plus one
facility in Argentina.
</p>
<p>
Gordon views circumstances like this, where gas is being perpetually
flared, as “opportunities to decommission” oil wells. But given sheer
demand, that may not be an economically or politically feasible solution
in the short term. Last year was a record-setting one for oil
production, as the U.S. pumped more than any country had in history.
</p>
<p>
So given that oil isn’t going to disappear overnight, this particular
fossil-fuel powered Bitcoin miner has been wildly successful with
climate-focused investors. Two years ago, Crusoe closed its $350 million
Series C round, led by clean tech investor G2 Venture Partners with
participation by existing climate tech venture firms Lowercarbon Capital
and MCJ Collective, among others.
</p>
<p>
“It’s not just the lowest hash rate for Bitcoin mining, or the cheapest
cost of compute. It’s also the greenest and when those two things are
true, you’ve got an amazing business on your hands,” Clay Dumas, a
partner at Lowercarbon Capital, told me. He views shutting down oil
fields that flare natural gas as simply “not tractable” given today’s
energy environment.
</p>
<p>
But now Crusoe is shifting its focus on multiple fronts. Cavness told me
the company never planned to build its long-term business solely around
Bitcoin mining, though historically nearly all of its revenue has come
from the famously volatile world of cryptocurrencies. His co-founder,
Chase Lochmiller, has a masters in computer science with a focus on
artificial intelligence and has long understood AI’s energy demands.
</p>
<p>
“And so since way before ChatGPT, we’d had a view that GPU computing was
going to be actually the bigger opportunity and the bigger driver of
data center power demand. And if we could align that with wasted energy
sources and other curtailed energy sources, it could be a really
effective approach to reduce costs and also reduce emissions,” Cavness
told me.
</p>
<p>
Last year the company expanded its Crusoe Cloud service, which is
essentially its version of Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure. It
works like this: Crusoe builds the data centers (or co-locates with
existing facilities), buys the GPU servers, and operates a software
layer on top of it all. Then, companies looking to train AI models or
synthesize large datasets pay to access Crusoe Cloud over the internet,
remotely spinning up Crusoe’s GPU clusters to do the hard lifting.
</p>
<p>
Last month, Cavness said that the majority of the company’s revenue came
from its AI data centers, outpacing Bitcoin revenue for the first time.
If all goes according to plan, AI will comprise more than 75% of the
company’s revenue by year’s end. “You couldn’t really have timed the
launch of a cloud business focused on generative AI much better than
they did,” Dumas told me.
</p>
<p>
Then, as the world (potentially and eventually) moves away from oil,
Crusoe is also shifting its focus towards stranded renewable assets.
That means sourcing power from areas where there’s excess wind, solar,
hydropower, or geothermal on the grid, which leads to curtailment or
negative pricing for these resources. “So that’s how we think about
operating on the other side of the energy transition,” Cavness told me.
This business model, he said, creates an incentive for renewable
operators to build even more capacity, since they know they’ll have
customers for their excess energy.
</p>
<p>
Of course, Crusoe isn’t the only company and data centers aren’t the
only industry looking to access the cheap power that standed renewables
can supply. Excess clean energy could be used to make green hydrogen,
provide heating and cooling for buildings, operate direct air capture
facilities, or power microgrids. If renewables are used to mine
speculative cryptocurrencies, many would likely argue there are worthier
opportunities.
</p>
<p>
But high compute data centers — whether they’re mining Bitcoin or
training AI models — do have one major advantage. “You can talk about
highest use from a CO2 avoidance standpoint. But generally, the market
is going to treat highest use as the greatest willingness to pay,” Dumas
told me. “At this particular moment, it’s hard for me to imagine any
application that has a higher willingness to pay, and that is more
deployable than data centers.”
</p>
<p>
Crusoe wouldn’t reveal what portion of its operations run on renewables
vs. natural gas. The company’s current focus is expanding its Crusoe
Cloud service in Iceland, partnering with an existing data center that’s
powered by the country’s abundant hydropower and geothermal energy.
Crusoe also says it’s working to develop domestic behind-the-meter wind
and solar projects, which would be separate from the main grid and
directly supply their data centers with power, though none have been
formally announced yet.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately though, whether Crusoe uses renewables or flare gas, whether
it mines Bitcoin or trains AI models, investors have decided that it’s
undeniably better than business as usual. “You can complain all you want
about the carbon emissions of Bitcoin and compute, but they’re not going
anywhere except for up,” Dumas told me, saying it’s incumbent upon us to
bring this new computational power to market as cleanly as possible.
“And that’s really what Crusoe’s in a position to do.”

optimistic a deal to lessen threats of future pandemics is in sight</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Geneva — Despite the failure of negotiators to reach a pandemic
accord ahead of this week’s World Health Assembly, a senior U.S.
official remains optimistic that an agreement to lessen the threats of
global killer disease outbreaks is in sight.</p>
<p>“We think the elements of a good deal are already on the table and
that is why we feel optimistic because those are pretty good deals. It
is just a matter now of fine-tuning it to make sure everybody says we
are ready to sign on the dotted line,” Xavier Becerra, U.S. secretary of
health and human services, told journalists at a briefing in Geneva
Wednesday.</p>
<p>While disappointing, Becerra indicated that it was not surprising
that an accord was not reached after two-and-a-half years of
negotiations.</p>
<p>“Negotiations go on forever,” he said. “I think we have to put this
in perspective. You do not build a nation overnight. You do not build an
Empire State Building overnight. It takes a long time. Name me a major
international achievement that came overnight.</p>
<p>“I think there is clear consensus that we cannot let the status quo
be upon us if another pandemic comes,” he said.</p>
<p>His view reflects that of World Health Organization Director-General
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who, in his opening remarks at the World
Health Assembly on Monday, assured delegates that the negotiations were
on track and were not a failure.</p>
<p>“Of course, we all wish that we had been able to reach a consensus on
the agreement in time for this health assembly and cross the finish
line,” he said. “But I remain confident that you still will—because
where there is a will, there is a way.”</p>
<p>WHO says 7,010,681 people have died from the COVID-19 outbreak as of
April 13 and that a total of 704,753,890 cases have been confirmed in
229 countries and territories.</p>
<p>Becerra noted that threats against global health have an outsized
influence on broader global political and economic interests.</p>
<p>“There is no stability without health. There is no security without
health. Our nations cannot be strong unless they are healthy.</p>
<p>“Getting out of COVID is our main health priority,” Becerra said,
noting that U.S. President Joe Biden was committed to achieving a
pandemic treaty.</p>
<p>“When the president came in, we were experiencing two or three 9/11s
every day in America in terms of loss of life. That is where we started.
Today, we are walking around without masks. We are treating COVID the
way we treat the flu,” he said, indicating that now is not the time to
become complacent.</p>
<p>“I think we realize that another pandemic could be upon us. I mean,
we are dealing with avian flu in the U.S. right now. We do not know how
long it is going to be before we get another type of COVID kind of
tragedy. We do not want to wait,” he said.</p>
<p>Sticking points to a pandemic treaty include disagreements over
sharing information about pathogens that cause pandemics, a formula for
global sharing of vaccines and medicine during international health
emergencies, and financing to set up surveillance systems.</p>
<p>The WHO says that member states have agreed to continue to work
during the World Health Assembly “to develop the world’s first pandemic
accord” to prevent a repeat of the “global health, economic and social
impacts” of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“We really have an incredible opportunity this week,” Loyce Pace,
assistant secretary for global affairs at HHS, said.</p>
<p>“We have spent so long trying to come together and finding compromise
and consensus. I think we talk about what is left to do, but I do not
know if we talk enough about what has been done toward reaching an
agreement.”</p>
<p>“So, whatever happens this week, we need some deliverable, if only to
keep this momentum on towards any other work that should continue. We
shouldn’t be leaving Geneva and go home without an accord, not after all
that has been done,” Pace said.</p>
<p>Secretary Becerra agrees, saying that he does not think there are
substantive disagreements about the essential elements of a pandemic
treaty.</p>
<p>“It is more how they are packaged, how they are defined. People
generally agree with what we have to do in order to be ready to take on
any pandemic that may come across our path,” Becerra said.</p>
<p>“I am the son of immigrants. Optimism is in my DNA and so, I believe
we are going to get this done because it would be tragic, especially
given how far we have come and not get it done.</p>
<p>“We have to be ready,” he said. “Who knows what is coming around the
corner. Something is going to broadside us. We just have to be
ready.”</p>

I never used Bearblog, mainly because I’m happy with my setup and I have
no reason to look for another blog solution.

<p>
That said, a few weeks back I started toying with the idea of porting
the design of this site over to Bear, just for fun. And to my surprise,
creating a bear version of my site was surprisingly simple.

it’s currently up at

quick and dirty version. There’s some leftover code in there but it
should mostly work.

Quick note: I might use that test site in the future to code other

$1.2 million</a> to companies competing for a chance to sell carbon
removal credits to the federal government. These 24 semifinalists, which
were each awarded $50,000, include nine direct air capture projects,
seven biomass projects, five enhanced rock weathering projects, and
three marine-based projects. Up to 10 of them will be offered federal
contracts amounting to $30 million. “The Department of Energy hopes that
by selecting 24 companies that have been vetted by government
scientists, it’s sending a signal to the private sector that there are
at least some projects that are legitimate,”

credits marketplace.

<li>Brazil floods leave some permanently displaced

<p>
Weeks of deadly flooding in Brazil displaced hundreds of thousands of
people. Many of them now are — or will become —
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/05/28/brazil-floods-climate-refugees/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate
refugees</u></a>. Residents of the cities devastated by the floodwaters
are now rethinking how to live alongside the increasingly unpredictable
rains. As climate refugees, they join the survivors of other climate
disasters in recent years and the millions more who are expected to
follow in their footsteps over the coming decades. “Brazil is not going
to be a one-off,” Andrew Harper, a senior official at the U.N. High
Commission for Refugees, told <em><em>The Washington Post</em></em>.
“What we are seeing is the start of something that will become more
frequent and more extreme and lead to more people left vulnerable, with
no choice but to move to a safer location.”

<li>New satellite will study clouds and climate

<p>
SpaceX launched the EarthCARE (Earth Cloud, Aerosol, and Radiation

and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, on Tuesday in a mission
that will
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyddezqrlmvo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study
the impact</u></a> that clouds have on the climate. The satellite, which
has been 20 years in the making, will use four instruments, including
radar and imaging systems, to measure clouds’ altitude, structure, and
movement. The mission will take place at a relatively low orbit and is
expected to last at least three years. Researchers hope the data it
collects will lead to improvements both in long-term climate modeling
and short-term weather forecasting.

The Supreme Court will

a lawsuit</u></a> brought by the city and county of San Francisco
against EPA Clean Water Act discharge regulations. Lawyers representing
San Francisco argued in their petition that the federal regulations —
which prohibit violations “of any applicable water quality standard”
rather than setting numerical pollution limits — are too vague. “These
prohibitions effectively tell permit holders nothing more than not to
cause ‘too much’ pollution,” the
<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-753/290765/20240108152337022_2024-01-08%20SF%20Petition%20for%20Writ%20of%20Certiorari.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>petition

to keep permits in line with regional and state discharge standards.
“Those standards, in turn, establish specific limits to which
petitioner’s discharges must conform,” the EPA’s brief said. In recent
years, the conservative Supreme Court has ruled against the EPA in

Almost two-thirds of U.S. voters want oil companies to ”be held legally

consumer advocacy nonprofit Public Citizen and progressive polling firm
Data for Progress found that 62% of voters — including 84% of Democrats,
59% of independents and 40% of Republicans — supported the idea. Asked
about their stance on “criminal charges being filed against oil and gas
companies to hold them accountable for deaths caused by their
contributions to climate change,” 49% expressed support and 38% said
they were opposed. A growing number of states, counties, and cities are
suing major oil companies for climate damages. “These national findings
show these cases may be able to earn popular support, particularly in
blue jurisdictions,” Grace Adcox, senior climate strategist at Data for
Progress, told <em><em>The Guardian</em></em>.

<p>
Despite cooling inflation, many Americans still say higher prices make
it difficult to make ends meet. That’s especially the case for parents.
The cost of child care has far outpaced overall inflation for the past
few decades, to the point that it’s affecting the labor force. We
discuss. But first: Tensions between Exxon-Mobil and some of its
shareholders may well boil over this morning when the company holds its

executes a superset of the Motorola 6809 instruction set. It is a new
modern microarchitecture with 16-bit internal datapaths that balances
high performance vs small area / low power. The Turbo9R with a 16-bit
memory interface achieves 0.69 DMIPS/MHz which is 3.8 times faster than
Motorola’s original 8-bit MC6809 implementation. It is an active
graduate research project at the Department of Electrical &amp; Computer
Engineering at the University of Florida. ↫ Turbo9 GitHub page The
Turbo9 is aimed at SoC sub-blocks and small mixed-signal ASIC, so it’s
definitely not intended to be some sort of general purpose CPU. The
reason for opting for the 6809 instead of, say, RISC-V or ARM, is that
the 6809 enables a far smaller footprint due to being 16bit, which is
all the target market really needs from the Turbo9. The current version
of the Turbo9 is thoroughly verified and is capable of running C code.
However, we still consider this version v0.9 because we are missing a
few items. All the 6809 instructions and addressing modes have been
implemented and tested except SYNC and CWAI. The signed versions of the
Turbo9’s 16-bit divide and multiply need to be completed. Interrupts are
partially implemented including SWI and Reset. ↫ Turbo9 GitHub page This
is the kind of riveting content you’ll only really find on OSNews.</p>

agree that killing is wrong?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-29, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>
I don’t think it’s possible to morally support the ongoing bombardment
of Gaza, but that’s too weak a statement. What’s happening there seems
to be — based on what I’ve read through the news, what I’ve seen in
video, the stories that have been sent back to us — an atrocity. The
latest story, from Rafah, is of an airstrike on a civilian evacuation
zone where displaced families
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israeli-tanks-enter-central-rafah-palestinians-tent-camp-blaze-rcna154235">were
sheltering in tents</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Images showed the area engulfed in flames as screaming Palestinians fled
for safety, with some video shared on social media showing disturbing
images, including severely burned corpses and a man holding what
appeared to be the headless body of a small child.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There’s nothing flippant to say about this. This isn’t sports, where you
root for a team. It’s not a theoretical debate: certainly not for the
families who have no way to escape, kettled as they are into a small
strip of land under constant military bombardment.
</p>
<p>
The bombardment on Gaza is disproportionate and indefensible.
<a href="https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/more-13000-children-reported-dead-gaza-famine-nears">Thirteen
thousand children alone</a> have been killed. A quarter of surviving
children have acute malnutrition. There’s nowhere for them to go, and
nowhere for them to get the care they need. In the face of these
conditions, there must be a ceasefire. <em>Obviously</em> there must be
a ceasefire.
</p>
<p>
Making statements like this is fraught. It sometimes seems like we’re
being asked to fall into weird ideological lines that have little to do
with the humanity of the people involved. Following the events of
October 7, I unfollowed multiple progressive Instagram accounts that not
only described the attack and kidnappings as the necessary work of
de-colonization, but applauded the action. It’s clear to me that
Palestine has been annexed, its land
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement">illegally
settled</a>, and its people made to suffer at the hands of
increasingly-conservative Israeli policy. Protest and resistance are
inevitable and justifiable. Regardless, I can’t support the killing and
kidnapping of civilians, let alone accept <em>cheerleading</em> for it.
Not ever.
</p>
<p>
By the same token, I see some people online call for an end to the state
of Israel. What would that entail, exactly? Assuming it was a desirable
goal, how might one go about achieving that? Dismantling it would
involve unthinkable bloodshed.
</p>
<p>
Some people talk about how Hamas is the local government, and how the
people there voted for them, so they deserve what’s happening to them.
That it’s okay to bomb hospitals
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/01/middleeast/gaza-hospitals-destruction-investigation-intl-cmd/">because
Hamas is hiding out in them</a> — regardless of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_shield">international law
related to protecting the lives of human shields</a>.
</p>
<p>
The history, today’s political issues, and the road to a solution are
far more complicated than can be conveyed by memes and soundbites. I
have no solutions to the problems in this region or how to get to a
lasting peace.
</p>
<p>
But some things are not complicated at all.
</p>
<p>
Don’t kill. Don’t subjugate. Don’t dehumanize. Don’t reduce lives, in
all their complexity and beauty, to points and sides.
</p>
<p>
The core of this issue right now is — or should be — concern for human
life. Everyone, regardless of nationality or political affiliation,
should be appalled when children burn to death or are decapitated
(whether they’re in an evacuation zone or not). The ruining of cities
should never yield applause.
</p>
<p>
The protests on university campuses are the latest in a long line of
campus anti-war protests, and I’m strongly in favor of them. Except,
because of course this is true, there are people there who conflate the
protest over policy with protests of anyone who is Israeli, or even
anyone who is a Jew. I’ve personally heard stories of at least one
person being spat on, not because of any rhetoric they were espousing,
but simply because of who they were.
</p>
<p>
This all has the potential to escalate. I worry that it will. This is
all already so horrific.
</p>
<p>
These are human beings. The Palestinian people are human beings. The
Israeli people are human beings. Arabs are human beings. Jews are human
beings. They are not their leaders; they are not their circumstances.
They all - like all people - deserve to live, and live well. The death
of any human being is never something to celebrate or to praise as a
strategy. It’s all just endless tragedy.
</p>
<p>
Stop the killing. Find another way.
