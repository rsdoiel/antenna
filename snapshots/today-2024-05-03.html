id="statistics-prayer-personal-stories-how-protestants-helped-bring-ukraine-aid-to-us-house-floor">Statistics,
prayer, personal stories: How Protestants helped bring Ukraine aid to US
House floor</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — On Saturday, March 2, at 2:20 a.m., Serhii Gadarzhi woke
up to a drone approaching his apartment building in Odesa, Ukraine. He
heard an explosion just outside his windows and rushed to his 2-year-old
daughter’s bedroom. She was there. He grabbed the child, wrapped her in
a blanket and went to check on his wife and their 4-month-old son.</p>
<p>“The door was open. There was nothing behind it — just emptiness. My
Anichka is gone. My boy Timosha is gone,” Gadarzhi relates on the Odesa
Baptist YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Their bodies were found in the rubble after almost 24 hours of
searching. All seven floors had collapsed on top of his wife and the
baby sleeping on her chest, Gadarzhi said. That Russian attack with
Iranian-made drones killed 12 people, including five children and seven
adults.</p>
<p>“I want to say to Mr. James Michael Johnson: Dear brother, we have a
war going on. A terrible war. And so many believers, brothers and
sisters, are being killed. Little children are being killed. Help is
very important to us. Especially military help because if there were a
missile to shoot down that drone, the drone wouldn’t have flown in our
house,” he says on the video.</p>
<p>Johnson, speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, had for months
delayed bringing to the floor of the House a bill providing $61 billion
in aid for Ukraine, including ammunition for its air defense systems.
The bill was finally approved on April 20 despite resistance from some
members of Johnson’s own Republican Party.</p>
<p>Just three days before the vote, Gadarzhi, a Ukrainian Baptist and
son-in-law of a local Baptist pastor, told his story to Johnson in
person. Gadarzhi told VOA that the speaker already knew about his
family’s tragedy.</p>
<p>“One can see in his eyes that he was compassionate, that he wanted to
support us and his response was very sincere,” he said.</p>
<p>That meeting followed eight months of behind-the-scenes efforts by
Ukrainian Protestants and their allies in the United States to tell
Republican members of Congress about the suffering of the faithful at
the hands of the Russian forces in the occupied portions of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Steven Moore, an Oklahoma native, was behind some of these efforts.
He worked as a chief of staff in the House of Representatives to a
leading Republican member for seven years, after which he lived in
Ukraine for a year.</p>
<p>When Russia invaded Ukraine, he was visiting his mother in Tulsa but
was back in Ukraine on day five of the full-scale invasion. Moore
founded the Ukraine Freedom Project NGO (UFP), which began delivering
food and supplies to the front for the residents and Ukraine’s armed
forces.</p>
<p>Through his work, he learned about abuses inflicted on Ukrainian
civilians by the Russian occupying forces, but one story struck him.
Victor, an Evangelical pastor from Lugansk, was evacuating a group of
civilians, including a pregnant woman and a baby, when Russians stopped
his car and took him to a basement.</p>
<p>“They tortured him for 25 days, including one day when they were
torturing him with an electrical Taser. And a Russian Orthodox priest
was standing over him, trying to cast demons out of him because he was
an Evangelical Christian. It blew my mind,” Moore told VOA.</p>
<p>He shared this story with a friend, Karl Ahlgren, a fellow Oklahoman
and former chief of staff of a Republican congressman.</p>
<p>“When the full-scale invasion started, Republicans in particular were
pretty supportive of Ukraine, and then their support waned. We had to
regroup and figure out what we could do to get the right message out to
Republicans,” said Ahlgren, who joined UFP as a vice president for
public policy.</p>
<p>Beginning in September 2023, Moore, Ahlgren and their Chief Operating
Officer Anna Shvetsova met with about 100 members of Congress and their
staff, telling them about the persecution of Ukrainian Protestants by
Russians.</p>
<p>UFP conducted a survey that showed 70% of Evangelical Christians who
vote Republican are more likely to support Ukraine if they learn about
Russia torturing and murdering people of their faith, Moore said. They
were surprised to discover that most members of Congress knew nothing
about it.</p>
<p>“Of the people we met with, there were probably three or four who
knew some of the things we were talking about,” Ahlgren said.</p>
<p>Moore said the group “had video of people talking about being
tortured, and we would show these videos to members of Congress, to
their staff, and they would tear up.”</p>
<p>Other organizations, including the advocacy group Razom for Ukraine,
joined the effort.</p>
<p>“I’m an American Baptist. I was shocked, in particular, that so many
Baptist churches in occupied Ukraine have been harassed,” said Melinda
Haring, a senior adviser for Razom for Ukraine. “More than 26 pastors
have been killed since the full-scale war, and 400 Baptist congregations
have lost their premises or some of their property.”</p>
<p>She said that at the meetings with the members of Congress and their
staffers, she and her colleagues provided statistics of damage caused by
Russia to the Ukrainian Christians, told personal stories and prayed
together.</p>
<p>Some efforts specifically targeted Johnson, a Southern Baptist from
Louisiana.</p>
<p>“We sponsored a billboard with Mike Johnson’s favorite Bible verse,”
Haring said. “It’s a passage from the Book of Esther. Esther is before
her uncle Mordecai, and she’s afraid to see the king; if she goes and
sees the king without his permission, she can be killed, and Mordecai
says, ‘You were chosen for a time like this.’</p>
<p>“We learned that Mike Johnson believed he was chosen to be the
speaker of the House for an important time. So, our billboard had a
picture of a destroyed Baptist church in Berdiansk with that Bible
quote.”</p>
<p>Razom placed six of the billboards in Louisiana, including one in
front of Johnson’s Cypress Baptist Church in Shreveport.</p>
<p>Razom, UFP and other organizations cosponsored multiple trips by
Ukrainian religious leaders to the United States and helped them to
organize meetings with members of Congress.</p>
<p>In November, 18 religious leaders and members of the Ukrainian
Council of Churches and Religious Organizations visited the United
States. In early February, dozens of representatives of Ukrainian
churches attended Ukrainian Week in Washington, organized around the
National Prayer Breakfast.</p>
<p>Then, four of them met with Johnson.</p>
<p>“The meeting with the speaker was very warm, and the conversation was
constructive,” said Anatoliy Kozachok, the senior bishop of the
Ukrainian Church of Christians of Evangelical Faith.</p>
<p>He said they handed Johnson two letters urging him to support
Ukraine, one from all Ukrainian Christians and one from the Protestants.
The speaker told them he and his colleagues were working hard to resolve
the issue.</p>
<p>“We felt united as people with the same values. There was a desire to
help and to find a solution to the issue of aid for Ukraine,” Kozachok
told VOA.</p>
<p>Another meeting participant, Valeriy Antonyuk, head of the
All-Ukrainian Union of Evangelical Christian Baptists, said the group
discussed shared values with Johnson.</p>
<p>“We Baptists have always defended everyone’s right to practice their
faith freely,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian church leaders were far from the only ones bringing
intense pressure on Johnson to defy much of his own party and allow the
aid bill to come to a vote, and only Johnson knows how decisive their
efforts were in his final decision.</p>
<p>But with Ukrainian forces losing ground and desperately short of
ammunition, the bill sailed through Congress on a vote of 311 to 112 and
was signed into law by President Joe Biden on April 24, clearing the way
for the military assistance to begin flowing again.</p>

id="democratic-us-congressman-indicted-over-ties-to-azerbaijan">Democratic
US congressman indicted over ties to Azerbaijan</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Democratic U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas and his wife
were indicted on conspiracy and bribery charges and taken into custody
Friday in connection with a U.S. Department of Justice probe into the
couple’s ties to the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>From 2014 to 2021, Cuellar, 68, and his wife allegedly accepted
nearly $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company
and a bank in Mexico, according to the indictment. In exchange, Cuellar
is accused of agreeing to advance the interests of the country and the
bank in the U.S., also according to the indictment.</p>
<p>Among other things, Cuellar agreed to influence legislation favorable
to Azerbaijan and deliver a pro-Azerbaijan speech on the floor of the
U.S. House, the indictment states.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice said the couple surrendered to authorities
on Friday and were taken into custody. They made an initial appearance
before a federal judge in Houston and were each released on $100,000
bond, the DOJ said.</p>
<p>The longtime congressman released a statement Friday saying he and
his wife, Imelda Cuellar, 67, “are innocent of these allegations.”</p>
<p>Neither Cuellar nor his attorney immediately responded to calls
seeking comment on the matter.</p>
<p>In addition to bribery and conspiracy, the couple face charges
including wire fraud conspiracy, acting as agents of foreign principals
and money laundering. If convicted, they face up to decades in prison
and forfeiture of any property linked to proceeds from the alleged
scheme.</p>
<p>The payments to the couple initially went through a Texas-based shell
company owned by Imelda Cuellar and two of the couple’s children,
according to the indictment. That company received payments from the
Azerbaijan energy company of $25,000 per month under a contract,
purportedly in exchange for unspecified strategic consulting and
advising services.</p>
<p>“In reality, the contract was a sham used to disguise and legitimate
the corrupt agreement between Henry Cuellar and the government of
Azerbaijan,” the indictment states.</p>
<p>The indictment also alleges an Azerbaijani diplomat referred to Henry
Cuellar in text messages as “boss” and also that a member of Cuellar’s
staff sent multiple emails to officials at the Department of State
pressuring them to renew a U.S. passport for an Azerbaijani diplomat’s
daughter.</p>
<p>Cuellar was at one time the co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan
Caucus.</p>
<p>The FBI searched the congressman’s house in the border city of Laredo
in 2022, and Cuellar’s attorney at that time said Cuellar was not the
target of that investigation. That search was part of a broader
investigation related to Azerbaijan that saw FBI agents serve a raft of
subpoenas and conduct interviews in Washington and Texas, a person with
direct knowledge of the probe previously told The Associated Press.</p>

<h2 id="jewish-voters-could-sway-us-presidential-election">Jewish voters
could sway US presidential election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — “Is it good for the Jews?” That has been a question long
asked by Jewish Americans, especially immigrants and those of the second
generation, scarred by memories of the Holocaust, when assessing the
policies of the U.S. government and the pledges of political
candidates.</p>
<p>Most of them, most of the time since Franklin Roosevelt first ran for
president in 1932, have voted for the Democrat at the top of the
ticket.</p>
<p>Fast forward 92 years. More Jews have been voting Republican in
recent elections, while many younger and left-leaning Jewish voters no
longer see unequivocal support for Israel as a litmus test.</p>
<p>Instead, rising antisemitism is reforging a sense of Jewish
self-identity — especially among those who consider themselves fully
assimilated and accepted in the American mainstream culture.</p>
<p>Antisemitism “comes from all sides,” said Rachel Sass, antisemitic
incident specialist at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism.
“There are right-wing extremists, left-wing extremists, anti-Israel
protesters. There isn’t necessarily a clear political or ideological
bent, just antisemitism.”</p>
<p>There has been a 900% increase in the number of antisemitic incidents
in the past decade, with a spike since the Israel-Hamas conflict blew up
last year, according to the ADL. </p>
<p>Jewish Americans are further alarmed by chants on college campuses —
in reaction to Israel’s retaliatory strikes on Gaza following the
October 7 Hamas terror attack — of “from the river to sea” and “go back
to Poland,” along with some physical assaults on Jewish students.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen people respond with a level of fear, being afraid to
reveal their Jewish identity. I’ve seen other people who have even
leaned more into pride in their Jewish identity, wanting to be even more
open because they feel that it’s very important,” said Sass.</p>
<p>Bestselling novelist Allison Winn Scotch said on the social media
platform Threads, “Every day, as a Jewish American, I get increasingly
nervous that we can’t come back from the brink of this. I don’t know
where my family could go though, and I don’t know how we would stay safe
when we got there anyway.”</p>
<p>She continued, “Your Jewish friends are living with a blooming seed
of dread in the pits of our stomachs.”  </p>
<p>America provided a refuge for Eastern European Jews escaping
19th-century pogroms, who followed the emigration from the more
established and prosperous German Jewish community.</p>
<p>Many Jews in the United States, however, did not feel totally
accepted into broader American culture until the civil rights movement.
Changes not only benefited Blacks but also removed remaining barriers to
Jews — such as housing covenants and restricted country club
memberships, as well as hiring discrimination at prestigious law firms
and entry quotas at the Ivy League universities that such attorneys were
drawn from.</p>
<p>The contemporary surge in antisemitism is not institutional.</p>
<p>“It’s children being targeted at school with antisemitic bullying,
synagogues being targeted with threats of bombs or shootings, people
even being assaulted on the street because they are visibly Jewish or
Orthodox,” according to Sass at the ADL.</p>
<p>American Jews, as is the case with other ethnic or minority groups,
do not wholly cast votes based on a single issue.</p>
<p>“We swing with the rest of the country around economic issues, war
and peace and all kinds of issues,” Mark Mellman, president of the
Democratic Majority for Israel, told VOA.</p>
<p>The Republican Jewish Coalition’s political and communications
director, Sam Markstein, said, “I think this will be the first time for
a lot of Jewish voters who’ve never even considered voting Republican in
their lives seriously making that consideration this year because of the
dereliction of leadership by the Biden administration on these
issues.”</p>
<p>Donald Trump, hoping for a second term as president but defeated by
Joe Biden four years ago, received somewhere between one-fourth and
one-third of the Jewish vote in 2020, according to several polls and
Jewish organizations.</p>
<p>“Anybody who knows anything about Donald Trump knows that his
alliances are based on people’s commitment to him personally, not to a
set of values, not to a set of strategic interests,” said Mellman.</p>
<p>Republicans have done a better job than Democrats in condemning
politicians in their respective parties who make antisemitic remarks,
Markstein contended, pointing out the RJC supports primary challengers
to Republicans in Congress who make such discriminatory comments.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, there are too many on the Democratic side that don’t
seem to want to follow that path and want to either run and hide or
issue mealy-mouthed responses that piss everybody off,” Markstein told
VOA.</p>
<p>Although Jews constitute only 2.4% of the U.S. adult population, they
are more likely to vote than the general registered voting population
and to make political donations.</p>
<p>“The Jewish vote in those [swing] states is going to be the decisive
[factor],” Markstein predicted.</p>
<p>The Republicans tend to draw most of their Jewish strength from the
religious Orthodox, the fastest-growing but still smallest Jewish
community among the three largest denominations. Most Orthodox Jews
strongly support Israel.</p>
<p>“Day after day, the administration’s response gets less and less
supportive of Israel,” Markstein contended.</p>
<p>A majority of Conservative and Reform Jews tend to vote for Democrats
and are more open-minded about a two-state solution in the Middle East
that would create a sovereign Palestine. </p>
<p>“To retain Jewish support, Biden’s campaign needs to keep doing
exactly what they’re doing — standing strong with Israel, against
antisemitism and behind the American Jewish community,” Mellman said.
“That’s exactly what I think American Jews are looking for at this very
difficult time. It’s exactly what the president is doing.”</p>
<p>VOA White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara contributed to this
report.</p>

systems comparable to FreeBSD: RedHat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu, Debian
GNU/Linux, or even Devuan GNU+Linux Regardless of the technical level of
the actual user, this is how the platform will be compared in the public
eye. Instead, with knowledge of the current bsdinstall(8) and
bsdconfig(8) utilities, I envisioned a BSD-licensed replacement for
Xdialog(1). Just like when invoking bsdconfig with the -X switch for
graphical mode, it could be dropped in instead of bsddialog(1) and allow
graphical installation – while sharing the infrastructure of the current
installer. To avoid confusion with the current implementation of Xdialog
from the x11/xdialog port, I have named its replacement gbsddialog(1).
It also has to be said that Xdialog is quite obsolete (latest release in
2006) and this shows visually too. ↫ Pierre Pronchery in the FreeBSD
status report I can’t believe it’s taken FreeBSD this long to both
consider and build a graphical installer. Currently being enveloped in
the world of OpenBSD, there’s clearly so much the BSD world has to offer
to desktop users such as myself, but at the same time, there’s a lot of
low-hanging fruit that the various BSDs can address to make the
experience just that little bit more pleasant. They obviously don’t have
to – not every project is aiming at desktop use – but it just makes
onboarding so much nicer. The next step – perhaps in 2037 – would be to
offer a desktop-oriented installation image, with a default desktop
environment and settings optimised for desktop use. Right now, a lot of
fiddling and optimisation for this use case is left to the user, and for
newcomers such as myself this means a lot of reading, making sense of
contradictory advice and suggestions, wading through endless, often
outdated, online guides, and so on. Now, I don’t particularly mind doing
this, but I’m sure it’s chasing people away who could end up making
meaningful contributions. Meanwhile, after trying out FreeBSD for a
while a few weeks ago but it not being a good fit for me, I’m now
exploring and using OpenBSD and it’s been a great experience. Although
unlikely, I hope OpenBSD, too, can perhaps consider making some minor
affordances to desktop users – because as I’ve learnt, OpenBSD feels
right at home on a desktop, more so than I ever expected.</p>

<p>COSMIC Desktop Environment (DE) is a new project by System76, the
company behind the popular Linux distribution Pop!_OS. In this tutorial,
we will give you an overview about COSMIC DE and its features, and then
we will walk you through the steps to install COSMIC Desktop Environment
in the latest Fedora 40 Linux system. ↫ Senthilkumar Palani at OSTechNix
A very easy way to try out the current pre-alpha state of COSMIC. I’ll
definitely be waiting on a more official release later this year, but
man, does COSMIC ever seem way more polished and complete than it has
any right to be at this point in time.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft is making security its number one priority for every
employee, following years of security issues and mounting criticisms.
After a scathing report from the US Cyber Safety Review Board recently
concluded that “Microsoft’s security culture was inadequate and requires
an overhaul,” it’s doing just that by outlining a set of security
principles and goals that are tied to compensation packages for
Microsoft’s senior leadership team. ↫ Tom Warren at The Verge The devil
is in the details regarding tying executive pay to security performance,
but it we take it at face value and assume good intent – which is a
laughable assumption in our corporatist world, but alas – I would like
to see more of this. It’s high time executives start paying – literally
and figuratively – for the failings of the companies and teams they
claim to run.</p>

<h2 id="biden-all-jailed-journalists-should-be-released">Biden: All
jailed journalists should be released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden has called for the release of
all imprisoned journalists — including three American reporters — who
have been jailed over their work, in a Friday statement commemorating
World Press Freedom Day.</p>
<p>“Journalism should not be a crime anywhere on Earth,” Biden said in
the statement. “On World Press Freedom Day, the United States calls for
the immediate and unconditional release of all journalists who have been
put behind bars for simply doing their jobs. And we call for the
protection of journalists everywhere, including during military
operations.”</p>
<p>At the end of 2023, 320 journalists were jailed for their work around
the world, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.</p>
<p>That total includes three American journalists: Evan Gershkovich and
Alsu Kurmasheva in Russia, and Austin Tice in Syria.</p>
<p>Gershkovich, a Russian correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, has
been jailed since March 2023 on espionage charges that he, his employer
and the U.S. government vehemently deny. The State Department has also
declared him wrongfully detained.</p>
<p>“We’re so proud of him. I can’t believe he’s holding up so well. And
he works so, so hard to be able to keep his spirits up,” Gershkovich’s
sister Danielle said at a Friday in Washington Friday commemorating
World Press Freedom Day.</p>
<p>Danielle said her family manages to stay in touch with Evan through
letters.</p>
<p>“I get a letter from him — it’s like Christmas morning. And I hear
his voice in my head when I’m reading it. And it just feels like I get
to chat to my brother. It’s a lifeline to my parents and I,” she said at
the event, which was held at The Washington Post headquarters.</p>
<p>Since his jailing, Russian authorities have not publicly revealed any
evidence to substantiate the spying accusations against Gershkovich, who
was accredited by Russia’s Foreign Ministry to work in the country. The
reporter will be held in pretrial detention until at least June.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kurmasheva, a Prague-based editor at VOA’s sister outlet
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, has been jailed for more than six
months and is also set to be held in pretrial detention until at least
June.</p>
<p>The dual U.S.-Russian national traveled to Russia in May 2023 for a
family emergency. Her passports were confiscated when she tried to leave
the country in June 2023. She was waiting for them to be returned when
she was arrested in October 2023.</p>
<p>Kurmasheva stands accused of failing to self-register as a so-called
“foreign agent” and spreading what Moscow views as false information
about the Russia military. The journalist and her employer reject the
charges against her.</p>
<p>“She’s the mom of two wonderful young women who had to grow up
awfully quickly over the last six months that she’s been in prison,”
RFE/RL President Stephen Capus said at the event.</p>
<p>In a prerecorded video message, Kurmasheva’s 15-year-old daughter
Bibi called for her mother’s immediate release.</p>
<p>“My mom, Alsu, has been behind bars in Russia for six months now,
because she is a journalist,” she said. “My sister and I are so proud of
her, and we miss her so, so much. She needs to be freed immediately so
she can come home to us. Free Alsu.”</p>
<p>Press freedom groups have criticized the State Department for not yet
declaring Kurmasheva wrongfully detained, which would open additional
resources to help secure her release.</p>
<p>Russia’s Washington embassy did not immediately reply to VOA’s email
requesting comment.</p>
<p>This year’s World Press Freedom Day takes place against a backdrop
that experts say is concerning for journalists around the world.</p>
<p>“Media freedom is under siege,” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio
Guterres said Friday in a statement. “Without facts, we cannot fight
mis- and dis-information. Without accountability, we will not have
strong policies in place. Without press freedom, we won’t have any
freedom. A free press is not a choice, but a necessity.”</p>
<p>In particular, the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas has led to
the deadliest period for journalists since the Committee to Protect
Journalists, or CPJ, began gathering data in 1992. As of Friday, at
least 97 journalists have been killed since the war began, including 92
Palestinians, two Israelis, and three Lebanese, according to CPJ.</p>
<p>“Journalists are civilians, so they need to be protected as any
civilian is during a war zone. They shouldn’t be targeted,” CPJ chief
Jodie Ginsberg said at the event on Friday.</p>
<p>New York-based CPJ has accused Israel of targeting journalists, which
the Israeli government has denied.</p>
<p>About half of the world’s population is set to vote in national
elections in 2024, which has press freedom experts concerned about the
safety of reporters and potentially harmful effects for press
freedom.</p>
<p>“This year is going to be really indicative not just of the future of
a free press, but the future of democracy, because how we treat our
media in the run-up to these elections is a litmus test for how the
other freedoms that we enjoy, and the other democratic rights we enjoy,
are likely to be treated afterwards,” Ginsberg said.</p>
<p>Discussions about press freedom tend to center on the negative, but
Clayton Weimers, the head of the U.S. office of Reporters Without
Borders, or RSF, said it’s also important to recognize governments that
are defending press freedom.</p>
<p>“World Press Freedom Day should be a celebration of the values of the
free press,” Weimers said.</p>
<p>RSF on Friday released its annual press freedom index, which ranks
180 countries and territories in terms of media freedom. Norway and
Denmark topped the list this year.</p>
<p>“There’s no freedom without press freedom,” Weimers said. “It’s the
freedom on which all the others are based.”</p>

<h2 id="us-employers-add-175000-jobs-in-april">US employers add 175,000
jobs in April</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The nation’s employers pulled back on their hiring in
April but still added a decent 175,000 jobs in a sign that persistently
high interest rates may be starting to slow the robust U.S. job
market. </p>
<p>Friday’s government report showed that last month’s hiring gain was
down sharply from the blockbuster increase of 315,000 in March. And it
was well below the 233,000 gain that economists had predicted for
April. </p>
<p>Yet the moderation in the pace of hiring, along with a slowdown last
month in wage growth, will likely be welcomed by the Federal Reserve,
which has kept interest rates at a two-decade high to fight persistently
elevated inflation. Hourly wages rose a less-than-expected 0.2% from
March and 3.9% from a year earlier, the smallest annual gain since June
2021. </p>
<p>The Fed has been delaying any consideration of interest rate cuts
until it gains more confidence that inflation is steadily slowing toward
its target. Fed rate cuts would, over time, reduce the cost of
mortgages, auto loans and other consumer and business borrowing. </p>
<p>Stock futures jumped Friday after the jobs report was released on
hopes that rate cuts might now be more likely sometime in the coming
months. </p>
<p>Even with the April hiring slowdown, last month’s job growth amounted
to a solid increase, although it was the lowest monthly job growth since
October. With the nation’s households continuing their steady spending,
many employers have had to keep hiring to meet their customer
demand. </p>
<p>The unemployment rate ticked up 3.9% — the 27th straight month in
which it has remained below 4%, the longest such streak since the
1960s. </p>
<p>Last month’s hiring was led by health care companies, which added
56,000 jobs. Warehouse and transportation companies added 22,000 and
retailers 20,000. </p>
<p>The state of the economy is weighing on voters’ minds as the November
presidential campaign intensifies. Despite the strength of the job
market, Americans remain generally exasperated by high prices, and many
of them assign blame to President Joe Biden. </p>
<p>America’s job market has repeatedly proved more robust than almost
anyone had predicted. When the Fed began aggressively raising rates two
years ago to fight a punishing inflation surge, most economists expected
the resulting jump in borrowing costs to cause a recession and drive
unemployment to painfully high levels. </p>
<p>The Fed raised its benchmark rate 11 times from March 2022 to July
2023, taking it to the highest level since 2001. Inflation did steadily
cool as it was supposed to — from a year-over-year peak of 9.1% in June
2022 to 3.5% in March. </p>
<p>Yet the resilient strength of the job market and the overall economy,
fueled by steady consumer spending, has kept inflation persistently
above the Fed’s 2% target. </p>
<p>The job market has been showing other signs of eventually slowing.
This week, for example, the government reported that job openings fell
in March to 8.5 million, the fewest in more than three years. Still,
that is nevertheless a large number of vacancies: Before 2021, monthly
job openings had never topped 8 million, a threshold they have now
exceeded every month since March 2021. </p>
<p>On a month-over-month basis, consumer inflation hasn’t declined since
October. The 3.5% year-over-year inflation rate for March was still
running well above the Fed’s 2% target.</p>

possible return reignites South Korea nuclear debate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Seoul, South Korea — South Korean calls to acquire nuclear weapons,
which were subdued for the past year following steps to strengthen the
U.S.-South Korea alliance, are once again bubbling to the surface ahead
of the possible return of former U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Trump, who appears locked in a tight race with President Joe Biden as
November’s election approaches, sparked concern this week after making
comments that many Korean media interpreted as a threat to pull U.S.
troops from South Korea.</p>
<p>In an interview with Time magazine, Trump lamented that U.S. troops
are “in a precarious position” — a reference to nuclear-armed North
Korea — and said Seoul should pay much more for U.S. protection.</p>
<p>“Why would we defend somebody … and we’re talking about a very
wealthy country,” asked Trump, who elsewhere in the interview said U.S.
troops were “in a lot of places they shouldn’t be.”</p>
<p>Those kinds of statements are not new. Trump has long questioned the
value and necessity of the U.S. military presence in South Korea.</p>
<p>Trump’s supporters say the comments are simply a negotiating tactic
meant to persuade South Korea to pay more for the cost of hosting
approximately 28,500 U.S. troops. Trump, they insist, does not intend to
abandon Seoul.</p>
<p>South Koreans appear less certain about Trump, who once said he
“could go either way” on the idea of U.S. troops staying in South
Korea.</p>
<p>Many are also concerned Trump could pursue a deal with North Korean
leader Kim Jong Un that would effectively recognize the North as a
nuclear weapons state.</p>
<p>“We can’t allow this. We must have our own nuclear arsenal, in a
limited sense,” Yoon Sang-hyun, a five-term conservative lawmaker, said
in a Facebook post this week.</p>
<p>Conservative South Korean newspapers have also begun publishing
articles reassessing the idea of nuclear arms — an idea once considered
unthinkable.</p>
<p>“The level of concern is really high,” said a researcher at a
government-linked think tank in Seoul, who supports South Korea
considering nuclear weapons in certain Trump-related scenarios.</p>
<p>“Almost every research institution has a project on preparations for
the Trump administration,” said the researcher, who noted growing
support among colleagues for acquiring a nuclear deterrent.</p>
<p>Many, including the Seoul-based academic, are hesitant to publicly
disclose their openness to attaining nuclear capabilities, seeing little
incentive to make statements that would risk antagonizing the current or
potential leaders of a country that South Korea has relied on for
protection for over 70 years.</p>
<p>Public support</p>
<p>If South Korea ever pursues a nuclear arsenal, the decision will come
with massive economic, reputational and regional security risks.</p>
<p>Not only could the move upend South Korea’s alliance with the United
States, but it could also prompt others in the region to pursue similar
weapons, invite international economic sanctions, and would almost
certainly elicit a fierce reaction from China, according to
analysts.</p>
<p>Despite such barriers, opinion polls consistently indicate between
60% to 70% of South Koreans support their country developing nuclear
weapons.</p>
<p>Even many national security experts, who are presumably more aware of
the consequences, back such a move.</p>
<p>According to a poll released this week by the Washington-based Center
for Strategic and International Studies, 34% of South Korean elite
support acquiring nuclear weapons. That support likely would increase
significantly if Trump wins in November, the poll found.</p>
<p>Kim Gunn, who will soon begin a term in South Korea’s National
Assembly after recently stepping down as the country’s top nuclear
envoy, said he can “fully understand” the sentiment of wanting a nuclear
deterrent, considering North Korea’s development of tactical nuclear
weapons.</p>
<p>But Kim does not advocate for acquiring nuclear weapons. Instead, he
says, it is vital that the South Korean public be assured that the
U.S.-South Korean alliance is “well-prepared” to cope with any
eventuality.</p>
<p>Last January, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol made global
headlines when he suggested South Korea could easily develop its own
nuclear arms if the security situation with North Korea worsens.</p>
<p>At the time, South Korea was seeing an unprecedented wave of mostly
conservative academics, ex-officials and other commentators calling for
nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Reassurances</p>
<p>Those calls subsided after Yoon and Biden agreed in April 2023 to
strengthen the U.S. defense commitment to South Korea in a document
known as the Washington Declaration.</p>
<p>In the statement, the United States vowed to deploy more “strategic
assets,” such as nuclear-capable submarines, long-range bombers and
aircraft carriers, to South Korea. In return, South Korea reaffirmed it
would not pursue nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>“The problem is if Trump comes back to the White House, he will
probably undermine the very basic pillars of extended deterrence — that
is, the deployment of strategic assets and joint military exercises,”
said Park Won-gon, a professor at Seoul’s Ewha University.</p>
<p>As president, Trump often slammed what he said were provocative and
expensive military exercises with South Korea. During his first summit
with Kim in June 2018, Trump unilaterally suspended what he referred to
as “war games” with South Korea, stunning some observers in Seoul.</p>
<p>Blunt talk</p>
<p>There is also growing concern about recent comments by former Trump
officials, who have hinted at major changes to Washington’s South Korea
policy, Park said.</p>
<p>Most recently, former senior Pentagon advisor Elbridge Colby told
VOA’s Korean Service last month that South Korea’s nuclear armament
should no longer be seen as off-limits.</p>
<p>“Nuclear proliferation, even to our allies, is a bad thing. But we
live in a world of hard choices, so I think everything needs to be on
the table,” said Colby, who is viewed as a leading candidate for a top
national security position in a second Trump administration.</p>
<p>Colby also said the United States may not be able to live up to its
defense commitments to South Korea if North Korea can conduct nuclear
attacks on American cities.</p>
<p>“We need to have clarity between ourselves and our own thinking so we
come up with a strategy and force posture … that actually mitigates this
threat from North Korea,” Colby said.</p>
<p>While analysts have long questioned whether the United States would
really sacrifice an American city to save that of a U.S. ally, Colby’s
comments stand in sharp contrast to those of U.S. officials, who
regularly insist that the U.S. defense commitment to Seoul is
“ironclad.”</p>
<p>“Those kinds of simple statements can seriously undermine the U.S.
commitment to defend allies,” said Park, who predicts a “huge wave” of
nuclear advocacy in Seoul if such comments continue.</p>
<p>Actions or words?</p>
<p>Not all Trump allies support South Korea getting nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>One of those who opposes the idea is Alex Gray, chief of staff in
Trump’s White House National Security Council. In an interview with VOA,
Gray rejected the notion that Trump should serve as a rationale for any
U.S. ally, including South Korea, to acquire nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>“I would really encourage everyone to look at the policies that came
out of the first Trump administration — not just the media reporting,
not just language and statements,” Gray said.</p>
<p>In Gray’s estimation, Trump was only trying to drive a hard bargain
in military cost-sharing negotiations so that the alliance could become
more beneficial to the United States.</p>
<p>But Gray also hinted at tensions ahead — especially after U.S. and
South Korean officials last week launched early negotiations on a new
military cost-sharing arrangement, 20 months before the current six-year
deal expires.</p>
<p>The negotiations, which have been characterized by some media as an
attempt to “Trump-proof” the alliance, show a “lack of respect” for
Trump, Gray said.</p>
<p>Robert Rapson, who served as a senior U.S. diplomat in Seoul during
Trump’s terms, said the cost-sharing negotiations and other efforts to
“mitigate the risks” of a second Trump presidency are “fully
understandable” but also risky.</p>
<p>“I would suggest that ROK officialdom not let its angst over the
uncertainty drive them to take preemptive actions that don’t necessarily
help them with Trump and may even backfire,” he said.</p>
<p>Rapson, however, cautions anyone from feeling too sure about how
Trump might act toward South Korea.</p>
<p>“The only real certainty about a prospective second Trump
administration,” he said, “is that there will be a high degree of
uncertainty.”</p>

id="biden-administration-100000-new-migrants-expected-to-enroll-in-obamacare-next-year">Biden
administration: 100,000 new migrants expected to enroll in ‘Obamacare’
next year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Roughly 100,000 immigrants who were brought to the U.S.
as children are expected to enroll in the Affordable Care Act’s health
insurance next year under a directive the Biden administration released
Friday.</p>
<p>The move took longer than promised to finalize and fell short of
Democratic President Joe Biden’s initial proposal to allow those
migrants to sign up for Medicaid, the health insurance program that
provides nearly free coverage for the nation’s poorest people.</p>
<p>But it will allow thousands of people, known as “Dreamers,” to access
tax breaks when they sign up for coverage after the Affordable Care
Act’s marketplace enrollment opens Nov. 1, just days ahead of the
presidential election.</p>
<p>“I’m proud of the contributions of Dreamers to our country and
committed to providing Dreamers the support they need to succeed,” Biden
said in a statement Friday.</p>
<p>While it may help Biden boost his appeal at a crucial time among
Latinos, a crucial voting bloc that he needs to turn out to win the
election, the move is certain to prompt more criticism among
conservatives about the president’s border and migrant policies.</p>
<p>The action opens the marketplace to any participant in the Obama-era
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, many of whom
are Latino.</p>
<p>Xavier Becerra, the nation’s top health official, said Thursday that
many of those migrants have delayed getting care because they have not
had coverage.</p>
<p>“They incur higher costs and debts when they do finally receive
care,” Becerra told reporters on a call. “Making Dreamers eligible to
enroll in coverage will improve their health and well-being and
strengthen the health and well-being of our nation and our economy.”</p>
<p>The administration’s action changes the definition of “lawfully
present” so DACA participants can legally enroll in the marketplace
exchange.</p>
<p>Then-President Barack Obama launched the DACA initiative to shield
from deportation immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally by
their parents as children and to allow them to work legally in the
country. However, the “Dreamers” were still ineligible for
government-subsidized health insurance programs because they did not
meet the definition of having a “lawful presence” in the U.S.</p>
<p>The administration decided not to expand eligibility for Medicaid for
those migrants after receiving more than 20,000 comments on the
proposal, senior officials said Thursday. Those officials declined to
explain why the rule, which was first proposed last April, took so long
to finalize. The delay meant the migrants were unable to enroll in the
marketplace for coverage this year.</p>
<p>At one point, there were as many as 800,000 people enrolled in DACA
at one time, though now that figure is roughly 580,000. The
administration predicts only 100,000 will actually sign up because some
may get coverage through their workplaces or other ways. Some may also
be unable to afford coverage through the marketplace.</p>
<p>Other classes of immigrants, including asylum seekers and people with
temporary protected status, are already eligible to purchase insurance
through the marketplaces of the ACA, Obama’s 2010 health care law, often
called “Obamacare.”</p>
<p>The president last year also unveiled a regulation that was aimed at
fending off legal challenges to DACA; former President Donald Trump
tried to end it, and it has bounced back and forth in federal court.
Last fall, a federal judge said the current version can continue at
least temporarily.</p>
<p>“President Biden and I will continue to do everything in our power to
protect DACA, but it is only a temporary solution,” Vice President
Kamala Harris said in a statement. “Congress must act to ensure Dreamers
have the permanent protections they deserve.”</p>

<p>
I understand the spite. When I bought my Model 3 five years ago, Elon
Musk had begun his public heel turn. Some of the signs of what was to
come were already there. However, Model 3 was the best reasonably
affordable EV on the market, and the Supercharger network made it
possible for us (California residents as we are) to own only an electric
vehicle. You couldn’t say that for the electric Hyundai Kona.
</p>
<p>
In the time since then, Musk’s erratic or adolescent behavior has caused
a rising tide of people, especially among the very online and the
political left, to openly hope for and celebrate Tesla’s failures. I
have not been among them. Musk’s brand was the best bet for getting
Americans to quit internal combustion, a goal that’s more important to
me than the man’s personal failings. Nor did I believe declarations that
the company was doomed. No matter what crazy thing Elon Musk devoted his
money or his attention to, it seemed like Tesla’s dominance in both the
EV market and the stock market could paint over the crazy.
</p>
<p>
Now, I’m not so sure.

Last month, we covered the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-elon-musk-self-driving-robotaxi" target="_self"><u>big
problems</u></a> with Tesla’s EV lineup. The only new vehicle released
since 2020 was the Cybertruck, which is suffering through slow sales and
a sudden unintended acceleration
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-cybertruck-recall" target="_self"><u>crisis</u></a>.
The sub-$30,000 model that would open up Tesla to the masses was
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-model-2" target="_self"><u>sort
of canceled</u></a>, then
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-q1-2024-earnings" target="_self"><u>sort
of uncanceled</u></a>, and now sits in limbo. Whatever that car’s fate,
it’s clear that Musk is obsessed with self-driving software and his
“robotaxi” at the expense of EVs actually driven by their human
occupants.
</p>
<p>
But if a self-inflicted wound proves fatal, it might be the one Musk
created this week by
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-supercharger-layoffs" target="_self"><u>laying
off</u></a> essentially the entire team in charge of Tesla’s
Supercharger network. That includes
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-supercharger-layoffs-musk" target="_self"><u>Rebecca
Tinucci</u></a>, his senior director of EV charging, who led the effort
starting in 2022 to convince the other automakers to adopt Tesla’s
formerly proprietary plug standard as their own.
</p>
<p>
Tinucci’s achievement was one of the company’s few undisputed success
stories during the past several years of chaos. One by one, the other
automakers ditched plug standards that were supported by third-party
charging companies like EVgo and Electrify America to adopt the Tesla
plug, which was christened the North American Charging Standard. Ford
and Rivian EVs have begun this year to use a big part of Tesla’s robust
Supercharger network. I cannot tell you how many excited, targeted
Instagram ads I’ve gotten from Rivian celebrating the new access.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-supercharger-ford-gm" target="_self"><u>This
was a huge deal</u></a> for American EV adoption. Tesla’s fast-chargers
are
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-national-parks-charging" target="_self"><u>widespread</u></a>,
simple to use, and far more reliable than the oft-busted charging
stations other EVs previously had to rely on. And it was a huge deal for
Tesla, which created out of nowhere a huge new customer base ready to
pay for its electricity.
</p>
<p>
And now, at what should be a moment of triumph at winning the charging
wars, Musk has pivoted away. He
<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1785406795814510785" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wrote</u></a>
on his social network formerly named Twitter: “Tesla still plans to grow
the Supercharger network, just at a slower pace for new locations and
more focus on 100% uptime and expansion of existing locations.”
</p>
<p>
Frankly, this sounds like an attempt to hand-wave away a spectacular
self-own. As <em><em>The Verge</em></em>
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/30/24145621/tesla-layoff-supercharger-ev-charging-nacs-elon-musk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>:
“Station installations were up 26% year over year, while the number of
connectors was up 27%. It was a rare area of growth for the company,
which has seen its sales and profits fall since last year as demand for
EVs cools down.” In trying to become lean and innovative, all Musk
managed to do was kneecap a part of Tesla that’s actually working.
</p>
<p>
The company has to keep making money while Musk busies himself with
trying to solve AI and autonomous driving. What with its inattention to
its EV lineup and shooting itself in the foot over Supercharging,
suddenly the winning options are few. Tesla’s other business is in home
energy, where it installs solar panels and sells its
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/11/tesla-details-powerwall-3-cheaper-stack/" target="_blank"><u>Powerwall</u></a>
home batteries. This is a lucrative market as energy storage becomes
increasingly important to the grid and home of the future — unless Musk
decides that, like selling cars, it’s too boring.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Given its huge lead in EV sales and EV charging, Tesla is forever just a
few good decisions away from trending upward again. It’s just getting
more difficult each day to imagine the company doing so.

<li>Treasury releases final EV tax credit eligibility
</h3>
<p>
The Treasury Department and the Department of Energy finalized rules
that determine which EVs are eligible for the $7,500 consumer tax credit
and $4,000 used vehicle tax credit on Friday. More specifically, the
rules govern what percentage of battery components and critical minerals
have to be sourced from the U.S. or our trade allies, how to determine
whether those components were made by a
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-tax-credit-china-rule-2024?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_Y22o6ogrUIahxa01Q9CF_MCKTV75hqBBmXAYK961q7c5ftsRP2QgaXpC9sB4cpRcb-6a-" target="_self">foreign
entity of concern</a>,” and how manufacturers must document their
sourcing to the government. The administration made only minor
adjustments to the initial guidance released last year, such as a
requirement to conduct more detailed critical mineral supply chain
tracing beginning in 2027.
</p>
<p>
This is important news for automakers, who will have a more complete
picture moving forward of the investments they’ll need to make in new
supply chains and domestic manufacturing to ensure their vehicles
qualify. For consumers, though, it won’t change much. The administration
isn’t anticipating any immediate changes in the number of eligible
vehicles, and buyers will still be able to claim the tax credit as a
rebate off the listing price at the dealership, a program that started
at the beginning of this year.

China is taking steps toward putting floating nuclear reactors in the

Chinese state media has said that the reactors would power military
facilities there, according to U.S. officials, and though the reactors
are likely still several years away from being built, the plan is
ringing alarm bells. “Our concern is that the closer they get to

<h2>
Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?
</h2>
<p>
My name is Cory Dransfeldt and I’m located in Camarillo, California (a
suburban town north of Los Angeles and where I grew up). I studied
business in college and minored in economics. At the time I thought it
was a practical choice and I was also terrified of the math involved in
studying computer science. In hindsight, I wish I’d made a different
choice, but don’t necessarily regret the one I made at the time.
</p>
<p>
My first job out of college was working on the website of the local
newspaper (I started as a freelance employee during college and became
full-time after). This role was focused on updating the website with
content the night before the print edition became available and was done
in a utilitarian, but reliable Django-based CMS. I picked up some basic
front end development knowledge working on multimedia projects and
building my own tools to make the job easier.
</p>
<p>
I began to learn JavaScript by writing themes for
<a href="http://bowtieapp.com/">Bowtie</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecoute">Ecoute</a> as part of the
MacThemes forum community. I expanded my web development knowledge by
volunteering to build websites for metal bands I remain a fan of and
friends with like <a href="https://linktr.ee/cyniconline">Cynic</a> and
<a href="https://augurymetal.com/">Augury</a>. I gained a lot of
knowledge and ended up with merch, concert tickets and some really great
experiences out if it all.
</p>
<p>
I’ve built a career out of being a self-taught frontend-focused
developer and have worked at startups, nationally recognized retailers
(I’ve worked on every eCommerce stack short of Shopify) and several
different SaaS providers. The backend developer I worked with at my
first startup told me to learn languages and pickup frameworks as needed
— that advice continues to serve me well.
</p>
<p>
Unsurprisingly, programming and blogging remain my favorite hobbies,
along with searching for and discovering new music (I enjoy everything
from artists like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Waits">Tom
Waits</a> to punk acts like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomeansno">NoMeansNo</a> and
myriad death metal artists like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcass_(band)">Carcass</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy_(band)">Autopsy</a> and
newer groups like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Mold">Tomb
Mold</a>). If I’m not at the computer, I’m spending time with my lovely
wife of 9 years, our two children and our 4 rescue dogs (all
terrier/chihuahua mixes). I also mentor via
<a href="https://www.underdogdevs.org/">Underdog Devs</a> and help
organize the <a href="https://11tymeetup.dev/">Eleventy meetup</a>. I’ve
been getting tattooed more over the past few years and am in the process
of completing a sleeve on my right arm but am not sure that qualifies as
a hobby.
</p>
<h2>
What’s the story behind your blog?
</h2>
<p>
I started blogging after I graduated from college in 2010 and have
managed to recover posts dating back to 2013 that I’ve imported into the
current iteration on my site. I was inspired by blogs like Daring
Fireball and MacStories, though I don’t follow them quite as closely as
I once did. I viewed blogging as both a creative outlet and as a way to
continue practicing web development by having my own project to
experiment on and iterate with.
</p>
<p>
I started out on Tumblr, before moving to the first version of Kirby,
then on to Statamic, Jekyll, Next.js,
<a href="https://home.omg.lol/">omg.lol</a>’s weblog service and now,
finally (and quite happily)
<a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>. All of these presented me
with an opportunity to learn new languages, frameworks, tools and
development approaches. I love the simplicity and flexibility of
Eleventy and adore the community around both it and omg.lol. I like the
simplicity of blogging under my own name and settled on a domain name
that reflects both that and the development/technology focus.
</p>
<h2>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?
</h2>
<p>
My creative process tends to be very informal — I read a lot of articles
via the blogs I follow through RSS and enjoy both audio and written
books. I’m interested in web development, the state of the industry and
music, so my posts typically center around those topics (and,
occasionally, how they connect or overlap). I’ll often write a single
draft, edit it for clarity, brevity and correctness before my confidence
in the post wanes and publish it.
</p>
<p>
I want to grow into doing more research-focused writing to compliment
these briefer pieces and am excited about that approach as an area where
I can grow as a writer.
</p>
<p>
I write posts in markdown using <a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a> and
then insert Eleventy frontmatter that I store as a snippet in
<a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>.
</p>
<h2>
Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the
physical space influences your creativity?
</h2>
<p>
I typically write in an office that I share with my wife — I work from
home and have a corner desk with my personal machine (a typically docked
M2 MacBook Air), work machine and a lightly-used TV in between. I
struggle to concentrate in silence and will typically write and program
with death or black metal playing. I find the music helps me focus and
the lack of intelligible lyrics keeps it from distracting me.
</p>
<h2>
A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech
stack?
</h2>
<p>
My blog is hosted at Netlify and I pay for the pro plan while staying
well under its limits, but this allows me the piece of mind to rebuild
the site regularly to update <a href="https://coryd.dev/now">my now
page</a> and other dynamically populated elements like
<a href="https://coryd.dev/links/">my links page</a>.
</p>
<p>
I moved my domains to DNSimple last year after Gandi was acquired.
</p>
<p>
The code for my site is versioned and
<a href="https://github.com/cdransf/coryd.dev">available to view at
GitHub</a>. I use a GitHub action to trigger hourly rebuilds of my site,
another to post content from a feed that combines my blog posts, shared
links, read books and watched movies to Mastodon, another to add my blog
posts to my README, another to test my site’s performance using a
<a href="https://speedlify.coryd.dev/">Speedlify instance</a> and yet
another to retrieve and cache the chart data for music I’ve listened to
over the last week from
<a href="https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/building-a-scrobbler-using-plex-webhooks-edge-functions-and-blob-storage/">the
charts I derive from Plex</a> (this is then syndicated to Mastodon via
the aforementioned feed and action).
</p>
<h2>
Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do
anything differently?
</h2>
<p>
If I were to start a blog today, I suppose I’d start from where I’ve
arrived at now, but I don’t think I could’ve arrived here without the
experience and discovery I went through along the way. I’m not a
particularly great designer, so I favor simplicity and performance in
presentation and, from a technical perspective, 11ty really lends itself
to that. I think I’ve found a set of tools and a community that I deeply
enjoy engaging with.
</p>
<h2>
Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does
it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some
revenue? And what’s your position on people monetising personal blogs?
</h2>
<p>
The expenses to run my site are fairly straightforward: hosting
(Netlify), analytics (Clicky) and feed hosting/analytics (Feedpress). A
quick estimate for a given year would be around $400 which I’m happy
with for something I enjoy so much. There’s also a tiny fee monthly for
a Backblaze B2 bucket I use to cache JSON used to populate my links page
(they’re fetched from the Readwise Reader API which is paginated and
rate-limited — this allows me to persist link data and puts less of a
burden on their service).
</p>
<p>
I’m not opposed to bloggers monetizing their sites, but I appreciate
when, say, content is clearly marked as sponsored. I have a Buy Me a
Coffee link in my site’s navigation, but nothing outside of that — if
someone wants to send something along I appreciate it and, if not,
that’s totally fine too!
</p>
<p>
I support a few larger publications that started on and have since left
Substack. Among my favorites are Paris Marx’s
<a href="https://disconnect.blog/">Disconnect</a> and
<a href="https://www.garbageday.email/">Garbage Day</a>.
</p>
<h2>
Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out?
And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?
</h2>
<p>
I’ll start off by saying I <em>love</em> the resurgence of blogs and
personal sites we’re seeing. I have a
<a href="https://coryd.dev/blogroll">blogroll</a> on my site with some
of my favorites (they’re also bundled into a .opml file that you can
download). <a href="https://rknight.me/">Robb Knight</a>’s blog remains
one of my favorites — the design is stellar and he’s constantly
experimenting with and adding new features. I also thoroughly enjoy
<a href="https://notes.neatnik.net/">Adam Newbold</a>’s writing and
seeing what he’s working on for omg.lol. I could go on and on I love
<a href="https://gkeenan.co/avgb">Keenan</a>’s writing,
<a href="https://blog.mayank.co/">Mayank</a> is a gifted developer and
similarly talented writer, <a href="https://sarajoy.dev/">Sara Joy</a>
is exceedingly kind and has created awesome projects like
<a href="https://rs.sjoy.lol/">RS.S JOY.lol dev</a>. The internet’s
changing and seeing everyone writing and building makes me so happy.
</p>
<h2>
Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?
</h2>
<p>
If you want to mentor some great, deserving folks, check out
<a href="https://www.underdogdevs.org/">Underdog Devs</a>. If you’re
building with Eleventy we’d love to have you
<a href="https://11tymeetup.dev/">present at the meetup</a>. The best
book I’ve finished this year has been
<a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/05de5de3-3572-4d50-b70e-651909502ca1"><em>NoMeansNo:
From Obscurity to Oblivion</em></a> — they’re my favorite band so,
naturally, I’m biased, but it’s a fun read and is built around
interviews with the band, their friends, family and other popular
musicians.
</p>
<p>
I don’t have any active side projects at the moment (but I’m kicking
around some ideas) — fitting everything in is tough! I’d love to build
something that makes it easier for small bands to quickly build
lightweight websites that they can host anywhere and really bring my
journey full circle — a static site generator as a service with portable
code and easy CMS integration? More robust than LinkTree, with less
overhead than Squarespace and more open than both. I’m more interested
in supporting musicians than I am in monetizing anything I suppose.
</p>
<p>
I’m also excited to see what Robb Knight is cooking up with
<a href="https://echofeed.app/">EchoFeed</a>.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for reading! I post a lot on <a href="https://coryd.dev/">my
site</a> and on <a href="https://social.lol/@cory">Mastodon</a> so come
say hi!

and no-emissions buses</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Or, if you’re the oil and gas industry, you could donate it to the
former president of the United States to help cover his mounting legal
fees.
</p>
<p>
According to new analysis by the strategic communications group Climate
Power, allies of Big Oil pumped more than $6.4 million into Donald
Trump’s joint fundraising committee in just the first three months of
2024 — on pace to surpass the $6.9 million the industry contributed in
all of 2023. “From the private equity firm execs to investors to
anti-climate activists like Linda McMahon, Trump’s Small Business
administrator — they all want Trump to undo our climate and clean energy
progress,” Alex Witt, Climate Power’s senior advisor on oil and gas,
told me. “And they want their jobs back.”
</p>
<p>
It’s no secret that the oil and gas industry has
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/11/10/trump-oil-gas-donors-climate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bolstered
Trump’s money-strapped campaign</u></a>. The recent slate of donations
to a fundraising vehicle called the Trump 47 Committee, has allowed the
former president to accept large checks from individuals and prioritize
the allotment of those funds. In this way, the Trump 47 Committee works
like a one-stop shop for well-heeled supporters like Linda McMahon,
formerly Trump’s Small Business Administration head and a vocal
proponent and investor in
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220123133244/https://www.journalinquirer.com/page_one/mcmahon-has-stake-in-oil-pipeline-plan-she-supports/article_7a0531a9-29ce-503b-ac4b-0dc314bd0c56.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Keystone XL pipeline</u></a> and
<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/linda-mcmahon-connecticut_n_576301" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>promoter
of offshore drilling</u></a>, and Kelcy Warren, the billionaire CEO of
the pipeline operator Energy Transfer Partners. Both maxed out the
committee’s $814,600 allowed contribution.
</p>
<p>
Trump 47 is technically a joint fundraising committee, a type of entity
allowed by the Federal Election Commission to bundle donations going to
multiple channels. This is nice for donors, who can cut a single check
that then gets divided among various buckets — in this case, the Trump
campaign, the Save America PAC, the RNC, and 39 different state
committees, in that sequence. Critics say this form of fundraising is
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/04/17/campaign-spending-megadonors-joint-fundraising-committees/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
way around election laws</u></a> that aim to limit how much a wealthy
individual can donate to a given candidate. Importantly, super PACs
<em><em>can’t</em></em> donate to candidates or their campaigns, or
<a href="https://campaignlegal.org/update/super-pacs-cant-coordinate-candidates-heres-what-happened-when-one-did" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>coordinate
things like messaging with them</u></a>; the money raised by a joint
fundraising committee <em><em>is</em></em> directed by a candidate
(including into PACs), giving them fuller influence over the donations.
(Joe Biden uses joint fundraising committees, too.)
</p>
<p>
The Trump 47 Committee has
<a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2024/03/21/trumps-invite-to-major-donors-prioritizes-the-committee-paying-his-legal-bills-over-the-rnc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>prioritized</u></a>
funneling these donations toward a PAC that covers the president’s legal
fees, rather than toward the Republican National Committee, which is
<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/republican-national-committee-finances-money-limos-1854842" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>also
struggling financially</u></a>. While this strategy does not allow
donors to get around the individual contribution limit of $5,000 per
year to a political action committee, it <em><em>does</em></em> mean
that after the first $6,600 of a donation made to the Trump 47 Committee
(which goes toward Trump’s primary and general election accounts), the
subsequent $5,000 of each donation is earmarked for the Save America
PAC.
</p>
<p>
As a “leadership PAC,” Save America can’t be used on Trump’s campaign
activities; instead, it is structured to cover administrative expenses.
That has kept it plenty busy: The PAC has covered fees for 70 different
lawyers and law firms,
<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/24/trump-super-pac-funds-save-america-spending/73026734007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>USA
Today</em></em></u><u> reports</u></a>, with legal spending making up
about 85% of its overall use. Between January and the end of March, Save
America put

total of $8.5 million</u></a> toward Trump’s legal woes, including $5.5
million in
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-campaign-fundraising-february-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>March
alone</u></a>. (Fossil fuel allies have also
<a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2024/02/02/oil-industry-backs-trump-with-big-money-1-00139227" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>donated
large amounts</u></a> to MAGA Inc., a PAC that has
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/20/trump-legal-bills-fundraising-reports/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>refunded
millions</u></a> to Save America.)
</p>
<p>
The higher donation limits of a JFC make it more appealing for
supporters who want to cut big checks, and most individuals quickly pass
the $6,600 threshold. In my review of the 30 oil and gas industry
executives, investors, and allies who donated to the Trump 47 Committee,
according to Climate Power, I found none who donated less than $100,000.
</p>
<p>
The Trump campaign has been
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-campaign-fundraising-rnc-c0e8f1e7b59f70c5237e13a3462e5790" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>quick
to defend itself</u></a> against allegations that it is prioritizing
ex-president over party by pointing out that “out of an individual
donor’s maximum contribution of $824,600, less than 1% goes to Save
America.”<strong> </strong>(The Trump campaign had not replied to
Heatmap’s request for comment by press time.) It’s true that of the $6.4
million Big Oil allies donated to the Trump 47 Committee this year,
roughly 2% has ended up in Save America’s coffers, per my own back of
the envelope math.
</p>
<p>
What’s shocking isn’t how much money this amounts to in the grand scheme
of the obscene amounts of capital going toward defending Trump, however.
Rather, it’s that oil and gas allies — including Ray Washburn, on
Sunoco’s board of directors;
<a href="https://yorktownenergy.com/team/peter-leidel/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Peter
Leidel</u></a>, an oil and coal company director; and Robert Mercer,
who’s
<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mercers-trump-climate-denial_n_5c76b643e4b0031d9564572e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>funded</u></a>
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/08/greenpeace-exposes-sceptics-cast-doubt-climate-science" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate
misinformation</u></a> — have given
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-09/trump-got-7-4m-from-energy-sector-donors-making-him-their-2024-pick" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gobs
of money to</u></a> help defeat criminal charges against a former holder
of, and candidate for, the presidency of the United States. For this
there is no precedent. Fossil fuel interests “have made it super clear
that they are willing to help pay Trump’s legal defense to help keep him
out of jail,” Witt told me.
</p>
<p>
As an especially ironic footnote, Biden has
<a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2024/01/30/biden-administration-oil-drilling-permits-outpace-trump-ee-00138376" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in
certain senses</u></a> been <em><em>better</em></em> for the oil and gas
industry than his predecessor. A
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/01/09/the-energy-202-oil-industry-worries-about-trump-trade-and-shutdown-standoffs/5c34f4101b326b66fc5a1be3/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
unpredictable leader</u></a>, Trump was evidently a second or third
choice among for many of the fossil fuel industry’s biggest donors among
the crowded field of Republican candidates, both in 2016 and this time
around. Oil and gas magnate Harold Hamm, for example, initially
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/harold-hamm-gives-to-trump-after-avoiding-him/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>avoided</u></a>
committing to a Trump second term — only to come around to such an
extent that he was even rumored to have
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/billionaires-sought-help-fund-trump-bond-civil-fraud-case-sources-say-2024-03-26/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>helped
the former president meet</u></a> his recent $454 million bond.
</p>
<p>
It’s, frankly, a canny move. Plenty has already been written about Big
Oil effectively
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/meet-the-top-house-recipients-of-oil-and-gas-money/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>buying
influence over policy</u></a>. Just yesterday, Senator Ron Johnson of
Wisconsin, who has received
<a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/politics/politifact/2022/08/20/fact-check-did-ron-johnson-take-700000-from-fossil-fuel-industry/65410713007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$750,000</u></a>
from the fossil fuel industry since his election in 2010,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/oil-hearing-exxon-bp-chevron-shell" target="_self"><u>pulled
the Senate’s Big Oil disinformation hearing off track</u></a> by ranting
about “climate change alarmism.”
</p>
<p>
It doesn’t take much creativity to imagine
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>what
Trump might do</u></a> for his friends if he retakes the highest office.
</p>
<p>
“There’s absolutely no doubt that he would deliver Big Oil’s wish list
wrapped up in a bow,” Witt said.

id="russian-troops-enter-base-housing-us-military-in-niger-us-official-says">Russian
troops enter base housing US military in Niger, US official says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Russian military personnel have entered an air base in
Niger that is hosting U.S. troops, a senior U.S. defense official told
Reuters, a move that follows a decision by Niger’s junta to expel U.S.
forces.</p>
<p>The military officers ruling the West African nation have told the
U.S. to withdraw its nearly 1,000 military personnel from the country,
which until a coup last year had been a key partner for Washington’s
fight against insurgents who have killed thousands of people and
displaced millions more.</p>
<p>A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Russian forces were not mingling with U.S. troops but were using a
separate hangar at Airbase 101, which is next to Diori Hamani
International Airport in Niamey, Niger’s capital.</p>
<p>The move by Russia’s military, which Reuters was the first to report,
puts U.S. and Russian troops in close proximity at a time when the
nations’ military and diplomatic rivalry is increasingly acrimonious
over the conflict in Ukraine.</p>
<p>It also raises questions about the fate of U.S. installations in the
country following a withdrawal. “(The situation) is not great but in the
short-term manageable,” the official said.</p>
<p>Asked about the Reuters report, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin
played down any risk to American troops or the chance that Russian
troops might get close to U.S. military hardware.</p>
<p>“The Russians are in a separate compound and don’t have access to
U.S. forces or access to our equipment,” Austin told a press conference
in Honolulu.</p>
<p>“I’m always focused on the safety and protection of our troops … But
right now, I don’t see a significant issue here in terms of our force
protection.”</p>
<p>The Nigerien and Russian embassies in Washington did not immediately
respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The U.S. and its allies have been forced to move troops out of a
number of African countries following coups that brought to power groups
eager to distance themselves from Western governments. In addition to
the impending departure from Niger, U.S. troops have also left Chad in
recent days, while French forces have been kicked out of Mali and
Burkina Faso.</p>
<p>At the same time, Russia is seeking to strengthen relations with
African nations, pitching Moscow as a friendly country with no colonial
baggage in the continent.</p>
<p>Mali, for example, has in recent years become one of Russia’s closest
African allies, with the Wagner Group mercenary force deploying there to
fight jihadist insurgents.</p>
<p>Russia has described relations with the United States as “below zero”
because of U.S. military and financial aid for Ukraine in its effort to
defend against invading Russian forces.</p>
<p>The U.S. official said Nigerien authorities had told President Joe
Biden’s administration that about 60 Russian military personnel would be
in Niger, but the official could not verify that number.</p>
<p>After the coup, the U.S. military moved some of its forces in Niger
from Airbase 101 to Airbase 201 in the city of Agadez.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear what U.S. military equipment remained at
Airbase 101.</p>
<p>The United States built Airbase 201 in central Niger at a cost of
more than $100 million. Since 2018 it has been used to target Islamic
State and al Qaeda affiliate Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen
(JNIM) fighters with armed drones.</p>
<p>Washington is concerned about Islamic militants in the Sahel region,
who may be able to expand without the presence of U.S. forces and
intelligence capabilities.</p>
<p>Niger’s move to ask for the removal of U.S. troops came after a
meeting in Niamey in mid-March, when senior U.S. officials raised
concerns including the expected arrival of Russia forces and reports of
Iran seeking raw materials in the country, including uranium.</p>
<p>While the U.S. message to Nigerien officials was not an ultimatum,
the official said, it was made clear U.S. forces could not be on a base
with Russian forces.</p>
<p>“They did not take that well,” the official said.</p>
<p>A two-star U.S. general has been sent to Niger to try to arrange a
professional and responsible withdrawal.</p>
<p>While no decisions have been taken on the future of U.S. troops in
Niger, the official said the plan was for them to return to U.S. Africa
Command’s home bases, located in Germany.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-03, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog</p>
<p>More than 2,000 people have been arrested at protests on college and
university campuses around the country opposing Israel’s military
strikes on Gaza since the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas,
and the subsequent humanitarian crisis there. It is unclear how many of
the protesters are students, as many of those arrested have not been
affiliated with the universities, or how many of the arrests will result
in charges—sometimes arrests at protests are designed simply to clear an
area.</p>

that seemed to many of us to be nuts. Some of us joined cults. Others,
urban communes. Others, utopian communities in the countryside.</p>

id="austin-us-sees-no-indications-of-intent-to-hurt-us-troops-building-gaza-pier">Austin:
US sees no indications of intent to hurt US troops building Gaza
pier</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said late Thursday
he does not see signs that Hamas is going to attack U.S. forces who are
building a pier off the coast of Gaza to deliver aid to the war-torn
strip by sea.</p>
<p>“I don’t see any indications currently that there is an active intent
to do that,” Austin told reporters at a press conference in Hawaii.</p>
<p>Austin stressed that the top commander of U.S. forces in the Middle
East, CENTCOM chief Gen. Erik Kurilla, has put several security measures
in place to keep the troops who are building the pier and helping with
aid distribution safe.</p>
<p>“Our allies are also providing security in that area as well, and so
it’s going to require that we continue to coordinate with them very
closely to ensure that if anything happens that, you know, our troops
are protected,” Austin said.</p>
<p>The new port is just southwest of Gaza City. Last week a mortar
attack targeted the port site but officials said no one was hurt.</p>
<p>“This is an accident, a very serious accident waiting to happen,”
Bradley Bowman, the senior director of the Center on Military and
Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told
VOA.</p>
<p>Bowman, who is also a U.S. Army veteran, said Thursday that efforts
to feed those in desperate need are “laudable,” but security concerns
since the inception of this U.S. mission appear to remain unanswered
while some of the plans are still being developed.</p>
<p>“The kind of terrorists, the kind of person – I hesitate to use that
term – that would … wage the October 7 terror attack, use human shields
and hold innocent men, women and children as hostages, those are the
very same people that will not hesitate to attack those trying to bring
food and water to hungry and thirsty people,” Bowman said.</p>
<p>Crews from the USNS Roy P. Benavidez and several Army vessels started
building the floating platform for the operation last week, according to
a senior military official. Next will come construction of the causeway,
which will be anchored to the shore by the Israel Defense Forces.</p>
<p>U.S. and Israeli officials have said they hope to complete
construction and begin operations this month.</p>
<p>The senior military official told reporters the Pentagon expects
deliveries to “begin at about 90 trucks a day … and then quickly
increase to 150 trucks a day.”</p>
<p>Aid has been slow to get into Gaza because of long backups of
vehicles at Israeli inspection points. The U.S. and other nations have
been air-dropping food into Gaza, but each military plane only holds
about one to three truckloads of food, a U.S. official told VOA.</p>
<p>Aid organizations have said several hundred truckloads of food are
needed in Gaza each day.</p>
<p>Israel attacked Hamas in Gaza following Hamas’ October 7 terror
attack on Israel, which killed 1,200 people and saw hundreds more taken
hostage. In the nearly seven months since the attack, more than 34,000
Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to Gazan health
officials.</p>

At some point some real jerk-of-a-boss told his team, “I don’t care if
it’s not done. Ship it anyway and we’ll charge the customer to get the
rest,” and it actually worked. And now we get games that require DLCs to
play anything. I hate that we fell for it and that guy probably got

remains committed to diplomacy despite North Korea’s nuclear
escalation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The U.S. says it has been trying to engage North Korea
by sending messages repeatedly despite Pyongyang’s apparent lack of
interest in dialogue and its escalation of threats in the region.</p>
<p>“We have sent such messages in multiple ways – through third parties
and directly, orally and in writing – and have included specific
proposals on humanitarian cooperation and other topics for discussion,”
a State Department spokesperson said.</p>
<p>“We have also emphasized our willingness to discuss practical steps
both sides could take to address the security situation in the region,”
the spokesperson continued via email to VOA’s Korean Service on April
26.</p>
<p>“To date, however, the DPRK has shown no indication it is interested
in engaging. Instead, we have seen a marked increase in the scope and
scale of DPRK provocations, which have only served to raise regional
tensions and increase the risk of accidental or unintentional
escalation,” the spokesperson added.</p>
<p>North Korea’s official name is the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea.</p>
<p>North Korea has been conducting multiple missile and rocket tests,
including what it said was its first nuclear counterattack drills using
“super-large” artillery rockets carrying mock nuclear warheads on April
22.</p>
<p>Pyongyang has also ramped up its cooperation with Russia, sending
arms to support Moscow’s fight against Ukraine. Russia has been shipping
refined petroleum to North Korea above the limit of 500,000 barrels
annually set by the U.N. Security Council, White House national security
spokesperson John Kirby said Thursday.</p>
<p>The North Korean mission to the U.N. did not respond to a VOA inquiry
on its reaction to the U.S. description of its efforts made to resume
talks.</p>
<p>Dialogue between the two has been deadlocked since October 2019 when
working-level talks failed to reconcile differences over
denuclearization and sanctions relief that became apparent a few months
earlier at a summit in Hanoi.</p>
<p>Washington has maintained that it is open to renewed dialogue on
Pyongyang’s nuclear program without preconditions.</p>
<p>Former U.S. officials suggested that the Biden administration
provided the unusually detailed account of its efforts to engage
Pyongyang in response to criticisms saying it has not done enough.</p>
<p>“The Biden team is quite sensitive to the attacks coming from
‘liberals,’ especially critics who claim the administration has not
attached sufficient priority to North Korea and has not done enough to
pursue diplomacy with Pyongyang,” said Evans Revere, a former State
Department official with extensive experience negotiating with North
Korea.</p>
<p>Revere added that some of these critics are arguing that Washington
needs to change its approach, offer concessions and engage in arms
control and threat reduction talks with North Korea. He said this
explains not only the administration’s detailed description of its
efforts at talks but its willingness to discuss “interim steps” toward
denuclearization.</p>
<p>Two senior U.S. officials said in March that Washington is willing to
consider such steps and discuss sanctions and confidence-building
measures.</p>
<p>Robert Rapson, who served as charge d’affaires and deputy chief of
mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, said the Biden
administration may be trying to address China’s call for talks between
Washington and Pyongyang.</p>
<p>“It’s possible Beijing may have laid out a quid pro quo for any
support with North Korea by calling on the U.S. to up its efforts to
engage with Pyongyang – hence the statement” from the State Department,
said Rapson.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a news conference in
Beijing after talks with Chinese officials that he “encouraged” Beijing
“to press Pyongyang to end its dangerous behavior and engage in
dialogue.”</p>
<p>Joseph DeTrani, who served as the special envoy for six-party
denuclearization talks with North Korea from 2003 to 2006, said, “The
Biden administration wants to make it clear, for the record and as we
approach the November presidential election, that the administration was
proactive in its policy toward North Korea and they did everything
possible” to have Pyongyang “return to negotiations.”</p>

tax service to audit wealthy more, fix disparity on lower-income
Blacks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. tax agency, said
Thursday that it has taken steps to address a wide disparity in audit
rates between Black taxpayers and other filers. And it said it is more
closely examining the returns of larger numbers of wealthy people and
major companies.</p>
<p>“We are overhauling compliance efforts to advance our commitment to
fair, equitable, and effective tax administration and hold ourselves
accountable to taxpayers we serve,” according to an annual update from
the agency.</p>
<p>A study from January 2023 involving university researchers and the
Treasury Department found that IRS data-driven algorithms selected Black
taxpayers for auditing at up to 4.7 times the rate of non-Black
taxpayers. The study said the IRS disproportionately audited people who
claim the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is aimed at low- to
moderate-income workers and families: While Black taxpayers accounted
for 21% of the claims for that tax break, they were the focus of 43% of
the audits concerning the credit.</p>
<p>“We have taken swift initial action to dramatically reduce the number
of those audits. We have also made changes to the selection criteria for
those audits,” IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel said.</p>
<p>Werfel, who was sworn in a little more than a year ago, has testified
before Congress about the issue and last September he wrote to the
Senate Finance Committee that the IRS would make changes.</p>
<p>The discriminatory audits, he told reporters, “degrade trust in our
tax system.”</p>
<p>Werfel and the IRS have tried over the past year to show how money
from the Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden’s big climate,
health and tax law, has helped to modernize the agency and improve
taxpayer services.</p>
<p>He also said that people making less than $400,000 per year would not
be subject to more audits because of the new funding.</p>
<p>Noting the promise to keep audit rates for people making $400,000 per
year and less at 2018 levels, he said on Thursday that “we haven’t in
any way exceeded that rate.”</p>
<p>He added: “There is no new wave of audits coming for middle and low
income” taxpayers — “that is not in our plans in any way, shape or
form.”</p>
<p>The IRS is focusing the next year on using the funding boost to
conduct higher rates of audits on suspected wealthy tax cheats after
having collected hundreds of millions of back taxes this year.</p>
<p>Ensuring that people pay their taxes is one of the tax collection
agency’s biggest challenges. The audit rate of millionaires fell by more
than 70% from 2010 to 2019 and the rate on large corporations dropped by
more than 50%.</p>
<p>The IRS plans to raise audit rates on companies with assets of more
than $250 million to 22.6% in 2026, from an 8.8% rate in the tax year
2019. It also plans to increase audit rates by tenfold on large complex
partnerships with assets of more than $10 million.</p>
<p>“While the IRS has accomplished a lot so far with IRA funding,” he
said, “we need to do much more to make improvements and transform the
IRS for the benefit of taxpayers.”</p>

id="arizonas-governor-signs-bill-to-repeal-1864-abortion-law">Arizona’s
governor signs bill to repeal 1864 abortion law</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>phoenix — Democratic Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has relegated a
Civil War-era ban on most abortions to the past by signing a bill
Thursday to repeal it. </p>
<p>Hobbs said the move was just the beginning of a fight to protect
reproductive health care in Arizona. The repeal of the 1864 law that the
state Supreme Court recently reinstated won’t take effect until 90 days
after the legislative session ends, which typically happens in June or
July. </p>
<p>Abortion rights advocates say they’re hopeful a court will step in to
prevent what could be a confusing landscape of access for girls and
women across Arizona as laws are introduced and then reversed. </p>
<p>The effort to repeal the long-dormant law, which bans all abortions
except those done to save a patient’s life, won final legislative
approval Wednesday in a 16-14 vote of the Senate, as two GOP lawmakers
joined with Democrats. </p>
<p>Hobbs denounced “a ban that was passed by 27 men before Arizona was
even a state, at a time when America was at war over the right to own
slaves, a time before women could even vote.” </p>
<p>“This ban needs to be repealed, I said it in 2022 when Roe was
overturned, and I said it again and again as governor,” Hobbs said
during the bill signing. </p>
<p>In early April, Arizona’s Supreme Court voted to restore the 1864 law
that provides no exceptions for rape or incest and allows abortions only
if the mother’s life is in jeopardy. The majority opinion suggested
doctors could be prosecuted and sentenced to up to five years in prison
if convicted. </p>
<p>Democrats, who are the minority in the Legislature, struck back with
the help of a handful of Republicans in the House and Senate to advance
a repeal in a matter of weeks to Hobbs’ desk. </p>
<p>A crowd of lawmakers — mostly women — joined in the signing ceremony
with celebratory airs, including taking selfies and exchanging
congratulations among Democrats. </p>
<p>The scene stood in sharp contrast to Wednesday’s vote in the Senate
that extended for hours as Republicans described their motivations in
personal, emotional and even biblical terms — including graphic
descriptions of abortion procedures and amplified audio recordings of a
fetal heartbeat. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, across the country, an abortion rights initiative in South
Dakota submitted far more signatures than required to make the ballot
this fall. In Florida, a ban took effect against most abortions after
six weeks of pregnancy, before many people even know they are
pregnant. </p>
<p>In Arizona, once the repeal takes effect in the fall, a 2002 statute
banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy will become the state’s
prevailing abortion law. </p>
<p>Whether the 1864 law will be enforced in the coming months depends on
who is asked. The anti-abortion-rights group defending the ban, Alliance
Defending Freedom, maintains county prosecutors can begin enforcing it
once the Supreme Court’s decision becomes final, which hasn’t yet
occurred. </p>
<p>Planned Parenthood Arizona filed a motion Wednesday asking the court
to prevent a pause in abortion services until the repeal takes effect.
Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes has joined in that action. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court set deadlines next week for briefings on the
motion.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-03, from: Memo Garcia blog</p>
<p>For me, lateral thinking is: Solving problems using an indirect and
creative approach. Using reasoning that is not immediately obvious and
involving ideas that might not be obtainable by using traditional
step-by-step logic. One “simple” approach to “think outside the box” is:
Understanding WHAT you want to achieve. Understanding WHY you want to
achieve it. Knowing the rules of the game constraints like environment,
budget, physical limitations, etc. Reframing WHAT you want in a way that
ignores these rules of the game.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-03, from: Memo Garcia blog</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about how we interact with technology, and
I’ve come to realize that being familiar with something doesn’t always
mean it’s simple. In fact, it can sometimes make things more
complicated. For example, when I’m working on code or documentation, I
find myself getting too close to the issue. It’s easy to lose sight of
the bigger picture and get caught up in the details. That’s why it’s
important for us to take a step back, look at our work from a different
perspective, and ask for feedback.</p>

id="judge-declares-mistrial-in-lawsuit-filed-by-former-abu-ghraib-prisoners">Judge
declares mistrial in lawsuit filed by former Abu Ghraib prisoners</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ALEXANDRIA, Virginia — A judge declared a mistrial Thursday after a
jury said it was deadlocked in the trial of a military contractor
accused of contributing to the abuse of detainees at the Abu Ghraib
Prison in Iraq two decades ago. </p>
<p>The mistrial came in the jury’s eighth day of deliberations. The
deliberations went far longer than the trial itself. </p>
<p>The eight-member civil jury in Alexandria deadlocked on accusations
the civilian interrogators who were supplied to the U.S. Army at Abu
Ghraib in 2003 and 2004 had conspired with soldiers there to abuse
detainees as a means of “softening them up” for questioning. </p>
<p>The trial was the first time a U.S. jury heard claims brought by Abu
Ghraib survivors in the 20 years since photos of detainee mistreatment —
accompanied by smiling U.S. soldiers inflicting the abuse — shocked the
world during the U.S. occupation of Iraq. </p>
<p>Reston, Virginia-based CACI had argued that it wasn’t complicit in
the detainees’ abuse. It said that its employees had minimal interaction
with the three plaintiffs in the case and that any liability for their
mistreatment belonged to the government, not CACI. </p>
<p>Multiple jurors told The Associated Press that most of the jury sided
with the plaintiffs, but they declined to give an exact numerical
breakdown among the eight-member panel. </p>
<p>CACI, as one of its defenses, has argued it shouldn’t be liable for
any misdeeds by its employees if they were under the control and
direction of the Army. </p>
<p>The plaintiffs’ lawyers tried to bar CACI from making that argument
at trial, but the jury was allowed to consider it. </p>
<p>Both sides argued about the scope of the doctrine. Fundamentally,
though, if CACI could prove its interrogators were under the command and
control of the Army at the time any misconduct occurred, then the jury
was instructed to find in favor of CACI. </p>
<p>The issue of who controlled CACI interrogators occupied a significant
portion of the trial. CACI officials testified that they basically
turned over supervision of the interrogators to the Army. </p>
<p>Lawyers for the plaintiffs argued otherwise, and introduced evidence
including CACI’s contract with the Army, which required CACI to
supervise its own employees. Jurors also saw a section of the Army Field
Manual that pertains to contractors and states that “only contractors
may supervise and give direction to their employees.” </p>
<p>In their note explaining their deadlock, the jury said the Field
Manual was one of the pieces of evidence over which they disagreed. </p>
<p>The jurors who spoke to AP said there was conflicting evidence in the
case about whether CACI retained control of its employees while they
were in Abu Ghraib. </p>
<p>The plaintiffs can seek a retrial. </p>
<p>Asked if they would do so, one of their lawyers, Baher Azmy with the
Center for Constitutional Rights, said that “the current expectation is
that we’ll continue to fight.” </p>
<p>The lawsuit was first filed in 2008 and was delayed by 15 years of
legal wrangling and multiple attempts by CACI to have the case
dismissed. </p>
<p>CACI’s lawyers declined to comment as they left court. A company
spokesperson did not respond to an email seeking comment. </p>
<p>While it took a monumental effort on the plaintiffs’ part to get the
case to trial, it’s possible that a retrial might be easier to conduct
than normal. Many of the witnesses testified through recorded
depositions that could simply be replayed. The three plaintiffs, though,
provided live testimony — one in person and the other two through video
hookups from Iraq.</p>

<h2 id="us-journalist-held-in-russian-prison-for-400-days">US journalist
held in Russian prison for 400 days</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>united nations — Four hundred days.</p>
<p>That’s how long American journalist Evan Gershkovich has been held in
a Russian prison.</p>
<p>Russia’s Federal Security Service detained him while he was on
assignment for U.S. newspaper The Wall Street Journal in the city of
Yekaterinburg and accused him of espionage.</p>
<p>The newspaper and the U.S. government have denied the charges against
the now 32-year-old reporter.</p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Thursday at a
U.S.-hosted event on the eve of World Press Freedom Day that reporters
are too often wrongfully detained for “simply telling the truth.”</p>
<p>“That was Evan’s crime. Reporting the facts about Russia’s illegal
war in Ukraine,” she said.</p>
<p>Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in March 2022.
Gershkovich was arrested a day after publishing a report on how the war
had hurt Russia’s economy.</p>
<p>Thomas-Greenfield said the Biden administration will not rest until
Gershkovich is reunited with his family. His parents and sister were
present at the event.</p>
<p>Mariana Katzarova, U.N. special rapporteur on the situation of human
rights in the Russian Federation, told the gathering by video from
Bulgaria that she is very concerned that Gershkovich has been held for
over a year without a trial or evidence.</p>
<p>“The arrest and detention of Evan raises serious concerns about his
personal safety, as well as the safety of all foreign journalists
conducting their legitimate business in Russia,” she said.</p>
<p>In October 2023, dual U.S.-Russian national Alsu Kurmasheva, 47, who
works for VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, was also
arrested in Russia. She remains jailed on charges of failing to
self-register as a so-called foreign agent and spreading what Moscow
views as false information about the Russian military. If convicted, she
could face up to 15 years in prison.</p>
<p>Kurmasheva was in Russia to visit her elderly and ailing mother.</p>
<p>Katzarova said Russia has one of the highest conviction rates in the
world.</p>
<p>“Once charged, the likelihood of being found guilty in the Russian
court is very high,” she said, “raising concerns about the fairness and
independence of the judiciary in Russia and about the rights of the
accused to a fair trial.”</p>
<p>David Rohde, an American journalist who was kidnapped by the Taliban
in Afghanistan in 2008 but escaped after seven months in captivity, told
the gathering that the source of attacks on journalists has shifted in
the past several years.</p>

<h2 id="us-defense-secretary-meeting-with-pacific-allies-in-hawaii">US
defense secretary meeting with Pacific allies in Hawaii</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>pentagon — U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was in Hawaii on
Thursday to meet with leaders from Australia, Japan and the Philippines
amid increasing concerns about Chinese military aggression in the
Pacific.</p>
<p>Defense officials said the talks would continue the allies’ “historic
progress” on cooperation in their defense industries and military
activities, including air and missile defense.</p>
<p>Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and
Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, called the
quadrilateral group an “anti-aggression coalition” whose efforts protect
“many countries around the world who depend on the ability for
commercial vessels to sail freely and unimpeded through the Taiwan
Strait and the South China Sea.”</p>
<p>“The single biggest reason for what we’re witnessing in Hawaii this
week is the increasingly aggressive behavior of the People’s Republic of
China,” Bowman told VOA.</p>
<p> “I think Japan, Australia and the Philippines understand that
investments in deterrence are far less costly than dealing with a war
that could have been prevented, and they understand that deterrence will
be much stronger and more effective if they work with the United States
and they work with each other,” he said.</p>
<p>Austin was to meet with Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister
for Defense Richard Marles on Thursday following Australia’s commitment
last month to increase defense spending by 20% over the next decade.</p>
<p>Austin also planned to meet with Japanese Minister of Defense Minoru
Kihara. During an April state visit in Washington, U.S. President Joe
Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced deepening
military cooperation, including creation of a trilateral air defense
architecture with Australia and trilateral exercises with the United
Kingdom.</p>
<p>Trilateral session</p>
<p>The U.S., Japan and Australia were to convene a trilateral meeting
following the bilateral talks, where a senior defense official said they
were expected to sign a new trilateral agreement on strategic research
and development.</p>
<p>Austin then planned to host a quadrilateral meeting with Filipino
Secretary of National Defense Gilberto Teodoro and their Japanese and
Australian counterparts.  It will be the second such meeting of the four
countries’ defense ministers.</p>
<p>A senior defense official, speaking to reporters ahead of the
meeting, said talks would  focus on deterring actors from activities
that could “undermine peace and stability in the region, whether it’s in
East Asia, the East China Sea, South China Sea or the Pacific
Islands.”</p>
<p>Tensions have risen between China and the Philippines in the South
China Sea, with China’s coast guard using water cannons last month to
threaten Filipino fishing ships. China has also used collision and
ramming tactics, undersea barriers and a military-grade laser to stop
Philippine resupply and patrol missions.</p>
<p>Bowman said he expected Beijing to complain about the talks as an
attempt to form a coalition like NATO in the Pacific.</p>
<p>“I think as a general rule, the People’s Republic of China wants to
deal with everything in the region in a bilateral way that allows
Beijing to take advantage of power asymmetries. … The bully on the
playground … doesn’t want to deal with four or five kids at the same
time,” he said.</p>
<p>Last month, Austin spoke with Chinese Admiral Dong Jun in the first
dialogue between the two countries’ defense chiefs in nearly 17
months.</p>
<p>The Pentagon said Austin and his Chinese counterpart discussed
“defense relations” and global security issues ranging from Russia’s
unprovoked war in Ukraine to recent provocations from North Korea. A
Pentagon press release said Austin stressed the importance of “respect
for high seas freedom of navigation as guaranteed under international
law, especially in the South China Sea.” </p>
<p>Beijing has asserted its desire to control access to the South China
Sea and bring Taiwan under its control, by force if necessary.</p>
<p>Biden has said U.S. troops will defend the democratically run island
from attack.</p>

<h2 id="microservices-vs-monoliths">Microservices vs monoliths</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-03, from: Memo Garcia blog</p>
<p>Which architecture should I choose? I don’t think this is the right
question to ask. A better question would be, given the current state of
my service/product, which architecture will provide what I’m looking
for? For example, performance, independent deployments, application
boundaries, etc. For example, many people mention that we should start
with a monolith and while I agree with some of the arguments (simplified
development and deployment, consistent performance), it tends to ignore
the fact that it might be better to prioritize freedom and
experimentation at early stages rather than performance.</p>

<p>GitHub actions are a problem because they lock you by the balls and
you cannot reproduce your pipelines. Getting to depend on all those
small Actions saves 5 minutes today, only to make migrations immensely
painful tomorrow. Build, package, and release software should be written
as standalone scripts that in principle could even run in the
developer’s machine. Moving them to CI is just changing the machine that
will run the scripts.</p>

<h2 id="risc-os-open-5.30-arrives-with-raspberry-pi-wi-fi-support">RISC
OS Open 5.30 arrives with Raspberry Pi Wi-Fi support</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>This is, in a way, a mature OS with an ecosystem and an aftermarket.
(Which, we feel we must explicitly spell out, means that quite a few of
those third-party applications and drivers will cost you money.) There
are emulators that will let you run 20th century Acorn apps that you can
find online, but this isn’t an emulated vintage environment like Amiga
Forever. It’s not meant for running games from thirty years ago. This is
a native bare-metal OS, built on 1980s roots but updated for 21st
century hardware. It’s also not an experimental project with little
practical use, like Redox OS or Serenity OS, interesting though those
are. ↫ Liam Proven at The Register I grew up with RISC OS and still run
a RISC OS machine to this day. As Liam Proven explains affectionately in
this article, while as an operating system it’s missing many features we
now take for granted (memory protection, pre-emptive multitasking,
compositing), some of the user interface ideas it implements still
manage to feel advanced compared to modern-day desktops (no need for
menu bars, no clunky file dialogues, elegant mouse button assignments).
The fact it’s found a home on the Raspberry Pi and continues to support
an active community is testament to its enduring appeal and the amazing
work of the RISC OS Open project. Some additional notes from Thom: this
new release supports 7 ARM platforms, most notably the Raspberry Pi
Zero, 1, 2, 3 and 4 (but not the 5), and it even supports WiFi on the 3
and 4, which is an absolutely incredible achievement. The number of
fixed bugs and addressed issues is massive, and there’s even more to
come later during the year, as The Register’s article notes. I was
waiting on this release to spur me on to buy a new Raspberry Pi (my only
other Pi is our Pi-Hole), so I’ll definitely be on the lookout for a
good deal. This release deserves my full attention for OSNews.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security recently released its 2024
Artificial Intelligence (AI) Roadmap. But for AI applications to enhance
operations as the department envisions, the roadmap needs to include
real-world testing and experimental efforts.</p>

<h2 id="the-basic-programming-language-turns-60">The BASIC programming
language turns 60</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Sixty years ago, on May 1, 1964, at 4 am in the morning, a quiet
revolution in computing began at Dartmouth College. That’s when
mathematicians John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz successfully ran the
first program written in their newly developed BASIC (Beginner’s
All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) programming language on the
college’s General Electric GE-225 mainframe. Little did they know that
their creation would go on to democratize computing and inspire
generations of programmers over the next six decades. ↫ Benj Edwards at
Ars Technica Even I have used BASIC in the past, when I was a child and
discovered QBasic (or possibly GW-BASIC, I’m a bit hazy on the details)
and started messing around with it. My experiences with BASIC didn’t
lead to a path of ever more complex programming languages, but for huge
numbers of people, it did – it’s wild just how many people over a
certain age got their programming start with BASIC in the 8 bit home
computer era. I mean, 30 GOTO 10 is such a widespread morsel of
knowledge it made its way into all kinds of popular media, such as a few
Easter egg jokes in Futurama. BASIC has effectively achieved
immortality.</p>

iGPU</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Qualcomm’s Adreno 6xx architecture has been superseded Adreno 7xx,
but it’s still used in countless devices, including the current-gen
Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3. Here, I’ll be looking at the Adreno 640 GPU in the
Snapdragon 855. Zarif98 on Reddit kindly provided a OnePlus 7 Pro, and
I’ll be using that to check out Adreno 640. Compared to the older
Snapdragon 821’s Adreno 530, Adreno 640 dramatically increases compute
throughput while still working within a very constrained power and
thermal envelope. Process node improvements help, and TSMC’s 7 nm
process should be far better than the 14 nm Samsung node used in the
Snapdragon 821. But cell phone SoC constraints meant Qualcomm couldn’t
go around copy-pasting basic GPU building blocks and call it a day. ↫

Microsoft, years of security debt come crashing down</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Years of accumulated security debt at Microsoft are seemingly
crashing down upon the company in a manner that many critics warned
about, but few ever believed would actually come to light.  Microsoft is
an entrenched enterprise provider, owning nearly one-quarter of the
global cloud infrastructure services market and, as of Q1 last year,
nearly 20% of the worldwide SaaS application market, according to
Synergy Research Group. Though not immune to scandal, in the wake of two
major nation-state breaches of its core enterprise platforms, Microsoft
is facing one of its most serious reputational crises. ↫ David Jones at
Cybersecurity Dive It’s almost like having the entire US government
dependent on a single vendor is a bad idea. Just spitballing here.</p>

<h2 id="ways-to-make-sense-of-elon-musks-supercharger-massacre">3 Ways
to Make Sense of Elon Musk’s Supercharger Massacre</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-02, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjE2MzQzOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NDc5MTE1N30.TWRTk4XNOenD5v9O3IFR2p4VTNcat8TEj9hJGci48eo/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
“Delete, delete, delete,” Elon Musk reportedly told his biographer,
Walter Isaacson, describing his approach to management. “Delete any part
or process you can. You may have to add them back later. In fact, if you
do not end up adding back at least 10% of them, then you didn’t delete
enough.”
</p>
<p>
Musk has taken his own advice: He is slicing to the bone. Earlier this
week, he dismissed the head of Tesla’s Supercharger network, Rebecca
Tinucci, as well as her more than 500-person team. As of today, Tesla
has only a barebones crew, at best, tasked with maintaining and
expanding its high-speed car charging network. It has already
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/30/tesla-pulling-back-supercharger-plans-firing-team/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pulled
out</u></a> of a planned expansion in New York City.
</p>
<p>
Musk also laid off what remained of the company’s policy and new vehicle
teams. These severe cuts follow layoffs announced in March, when Musk
dismissed about 10% of Tesla’s employees. According to <em><em>Electrek,
</em></em>the two events
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/05/01/elon-musk-throwing-weight-tesla-wrecking-ball/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>may
be related</u></a>: Musk asked Tinucci to make deeper cuts in her team
in April, she pushed back, and he fired her to set an example. The
company has cut more than 14,000 employees worldwide since the beginning
of the year.
</p>
<p>
The news is — and there is no way of sugarcoating this — either sort of
stupid, bad, or very bad for the electric vehicle transition. Here are
three ways of looking at it:
</p>
<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>It’s worrisome for other automakers
</h3>
<p>
Over the past year, every other major automaker in the United States has
switched to Tesla’s charging plug, the North American Charging Standard,
or NACS. They have struck deals that will let them use much of Tesla’s
existing Supercharger network; Ford is in the process of mailing its
drivers a free NACs adapter plug. These agreements were meant to give
consumers more certainty about the EV transition: No matter what car
they bought, they would be able to use most of Tesla’s superior charging
network.
</p>
<p>
Now, that certainty is gone. Which chargers will work in the future? How
much more will the Tesla network expand? And what will happen to those
deals with automakers now that the Supercharger team is gone? The
employees laid off this week included those who worked closely with
other companies.
</p>
<p>
At least publicly, Ford is keeping its cool. “Our plans for our
customers do not change,” Marty Günsberg, communications director for
Ford’s electric vehicle division, told Heatmap. And yet contractors and
others with business in front of Tesla’s charging team were left
completely in the dark Tuesday, their emails bouncing back from
addresses that no longer existed, according to
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/tesla-layoffs-shake-confidence-in-the-ev-charging-future/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em>E&amp;E
News</em></u></a>. No other equivalent charging network exists in the
U.S., meaning there’s no other easy place for them to go.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>It’s about hype
</h3>
<p>
Musk, for his part, has intimated that the company will begin to look
into wireless charging. Although wireless charging may make slightly
more sense for self-driving cars — the car could drive itself into a
given spot, <em><em>et</em></em> <em><em>voilà!</em></em> — it is a
puzzling decision from a man who has said the only real constraints are
those imposed by the laws of physics. More than half of current and
prospective EV owners
<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/features/mckinsey-center-for-future-mobility/our-insights/exploring-consumer-sentiment-on-electric-vehicle-charging" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>say
that they worry</u></a> about charger availability and convenience, yet
wireless charging
<a href="https://www.anker.com/blogs/chargers/wireless-charging-vs-wired" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>is
slower and less efficient</u></a> than wired charging, meaning it will
require <em><em>more </em></em>charging spots and each vehicle will have
to stay there longer.
</p>
<p>
So again we must ask, why? The answer may lie in the animal spirits of
the market — and Elon’s dependence on the market for his personal
wealth. Tesla’s stock has more or less held steady since the cuts. As my
colleague Matthew Zeitlin
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-supercharger-layoffs" target="_self"><u>wrote</u></a>,
Musk has spun the layoffs as part of a corporate turn away from selling
electric vehicles, chargers, and home batteries and toward achieving
artificial intelligence and autonomous driving.
</p>
<p>
That is partly because Musk must keep justifying — or, if we really want
to be blunt, <em><em>propping up </em></em>— Tesla’s astronomical share
price, which itself is premised on the idea that Tesla is a technology
company, not a car company. In order to do that, he must continually
steer his sometimes-profitable company toward the buzziest, most
hyped-up phenomenon in the economy. Never mind his <em><em>actually
existing EV charger business</em></em>; that can’t justify the fantasy
of the share price. He needs to find something new.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>It’s a bad sign
</h3>
<p>
One of the more useful ways of understanding Elon Musk is that he seeks
to create and control private infrastructure. SpaceX creates privatized
access to rocket launches. Starlink allows for privatized access to the
global, satellite-provided internet. The Hyperloop — to the degree that
it
<a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/hyperloop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>existed
at all</u></a> — sought to create a privatized and individualized form
of mass transit. (Musk, fittingly,
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-awkward-dislike-mass-transit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hates</u></a>
public transit.) Even Musk’s purchase of Twitter, now rechristened X,
reflected a desire to enclose the public sphere.
</p>
<p>
And for the past year, you could understand Tesla in the same light.
Sure, Tesla was an electric vehicle company. But it was rapidly becoming
an infrastructure company. Through its deals with other automakers, it
was cementing itself as the premier provider of electric vehicle
charging in the United States. It was also the part of the company that
elicited the least suspicion from Tesla’s many critics. Drivers might
not always be able to rely on a third-party charger, but a Tesla
Supercharger? It worked.
</p>
<p>
It hasn’t always been this way. For years, the Supercharger network
seemed like Tesla’s key competitive advantage, its
<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/economicmoat.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Warren
Buffett-style moat</u></a>. If you wanted access to America’s most
famous and reliable fast-charging network, you had to buy a Tesla. But
starting
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/30/24145621/tesla-layoff-supercharger-ev-charging-nacs-elon-musk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>with
Ford</u></a> a year ago, Musk struck deals with other automakers
allowing their cars to use some of its charger network. At the same
time, Tesla also
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-standards-and-major-progress-for-a-made-in-america-national-network-of-electric-vehicle-chargers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bowed</u></a>
to federal pressure and
<a href="https://www.sae.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>standardized</u></a>
its NACS charger with SAE International. That helped it
<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/27/tesla-biden-electric-car-charging-00143431" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>win
more than $17 million in grants</u></a> from the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law to build even more chargers.
</p>
<p>
Why pull back now? None of the options is very encouraging. The most
hopeful answer is Tesla-specific: Maybe demand for the automaker’s
vehicles is sinking so quickly that Musk is, in essence, reaching for
things he can throw overboard. Tesla has historically relied on Chinese
consumers to buoy its sales, but it has
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-03/tesla-also-losing-ground-in-china-as-it-disappoints-globally" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hemorrhaged
market share</u></a> in China as
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ford-gm-stellantis-byd" target="_self"><u>the
country’s home-grown automakers</u></a> have come out with newer and
often superior EVs. But things there took a turn for the better earlier
this week as Musk won
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/boss-battery-giant-catl-visits-elon-musks-hotel-beijing-reuters-witness-2024-04-29/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>approval
(albeit conditional)</u></a> to use Tesla’s so-called Full Self-Driving
software on Chinese roads. And even if a sales slump were the
explanation, why also ditch the team working on new vehicles at Tesla?
</p>
<p>
The other possibilities are bleaker. BloombergNEF
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-09/tesla-tsla-charging-network-has-become-a-serious-business" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
ballparked</u></a> that Tesla’s charging business could generate $740
million in annual profits by 2030. But that relies on Musk’s estimate
that the Supercharging business has a 10% margin. If that margin has
since shrunk — or if its chargers just aren’t getting used as much as
Tesla once anticipated — then further investment right now might not
make sense.
</p>
<p>
That’s a problem, though, as most prospective buyers say that there need
to be even <em><em>more </em></em>public chargers before they would
consider buying an EV. If the economics don’t justify a further
investment in chargers, however, even with all that apparently pent up
demand, then the country is in a pickle. In that case, Musk’s decision
looks self-defeating, a panicky and downturn-averse reaction that will
ultimately undercut the market for Tesla’s cars.
</p>
<p>
About the only bright spot here is that Musk has surrendered hundreds of
the most talented charging employees to the market. Tesla excelled at
using a mix of policy and engineering prowess to integrate their
chargers into local utilities’ systems and rate structures; other
automakers can now snap up the people with those skills.

<p>
When Gogoro rolled out its new high-performance electric scooter, the
Pulse, the world
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/01/29/gogoro-launches-new-pulse-electric-scooter/">got
its first glimpse </a>of an entirely new side of the company. Best known
for its battery-swapping system and cute, brightly-colored scooters, the
Pulse launched an edgy new look for Gogoro. But even more importantly,
it also showed off an entire suite of new high-tech innovations.
</p>
<p>
And so when I received an invite to be the first Westerner to test ride
the Pulse and share the experience with the world, I jumped on it. Every
company seems to proclaim that their new e-scooter is like none other
before, but only the Gogoro Pulse is one of the few that can truly mean
it. This electric scooter marks a paradigm shift in what is possible for
this form factor and with Gogoro’s swappable battery standard.

it worthy of the performance grade the Honda division is known for? Even
more, is it worth the price tag? You be the judge.

<li>One key moment from the Big Oil hearing
</h3>
<p>
Democratic lawmakers testified at a congressional hearing yesterday that
Big Oil companies were guilty of decades of “denial, disinformation, and
doublespeak” on climate change. The hearing followed the release of
damning internal documents suggesting executives from major fossil fuel
producers sought to “deceive the public about the enormous climate
crisis we are in and the role that Big Oil has played in bringing it
about,” said Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight
committee.

Jillian Goodman was watching</a> the hearing and found the most
interesting part to be when Sharon Eubanks, who led the Department of
Justice case against Big Tobacco, called for an end to the hand-wringing
about what should be done, and suggested the DOJ swiftly launch an
investigation into the petroleum industry, the outcome of which could
force it to change the way it does business. And that, Eubanks said, is
the point of all this — not extracting money, although that’s nice too,
but rather to force companies to operate in a more open and honest
fashion. “I myself am not a lawyer, of course, but it might be time to
listen to Eubanks,” Goodman wrote. “She seems to know what she’s talking
about.”

published in <em>PLOS Climate</em> shows how climate change is driving
power outages in New York. Between 2017 and 2020, about 40% of the power
outages that plagued the state were the result of extreme weather events
– mainly flooding and intense precipitation. Many of the areas most
exposed to outages have overlapping vulnerabilities, like low-quality
housing or lack of green space. “Eastern Queens, upper Manhattan and the
Bronx of NYC, the Hudson Valley, and Adirondack regions were more
burdened with severe weather-driven outages,” the study found. In
Queens, neighborhoods such as Jamaica, Flushing, and Richmond Hills
experienced more than 100 outages over three years. “We’re focusing on
New York state, but power outages are a growing problem nationally,”

blow</a> to a long-standing climate lawsuit brought by 21 young people
against the U.S. government. <em>Juliana v. United States</em> was
originally filed in 2015 by plaintiffs aged between 8 and 18 who said
the government’s support for fossil fuels had contributed to the climate
crisis and violated their constitutional rights. The case was ordered
dismissed in 2020 when the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals basically
said Congress, not judges, should decide the nation’s climate policies.
A federal judge in Oregon allowed the plaintiffs to adjust their suit
and said it could go to trial. But the Biden administration petitioned
the court to dismiss the case, and so it has.

Venting natural gas into the atmosphere produces a flame that can be
detected by current satellite imaging technology. Some oil and gas
facilities have started using “enclosed” flaring devices, which they
claim can reduce noise and light disturbances for surrounding
communities. But “it also means [flaring is] not visible from space by
most of the methods used to track flare volumes,” said Eric Kort, a
climate and space sciences professor at the University of Michigan.

The fund will raise money to help communities that are vulnerable to
extreme weather build resilience and adapt, starting with California’s
Central Valley and Imperial Valley. The crowdsourcing site is seeding
the fund with $1.5 million, and all donations are tax-deductible. The
platform told <em><em>Axios</em></em> that natural disaster crowdfunding
campaigns are becoming more common as climate change leads to more
frequent extreme weather events. The site has seen a 90% increase in
natural disaster fundraisers over the last five years.

<h2 id="indieweb-carnival-natural-creativity">IndieWeb Carnival: Natural
creativity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-02, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I spend the vast majority of my time doing creative work. I code for a living, sometimes I design for a living. I code as a hobby, sometimes I do design as a hobby. I also write. Being creative ain’t easy. At least not for me. I sit at my desk, staring at the same screen day after day and sometimes it’s hard to find inspiration. But every time I find myself stuck I can get unstuck with one simple trick: I leave.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
My creative environment is when I’m outside, not trying to do anything
creative. And this is especially true when I’m walking in nature. I’m
not the first one to realise that there’s a connection between walking
in nature and creativity. There’s something about moving through space
that makes my brain work differently.
</p>
<p>
Nature is, more often than not, my creative environment. Back in 2019, I
started a very random project called
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/writing-hiking-and-sharing">From the
Summit</a>. It was an attempt to capture this exact phenomenon, the
bursts of creativity born from moving through space. It’s easily my
favourite digital experiment.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the day though, the only environment that matters, when it
comes to creativity, is the mental space I’m in. That’s why I find
nature so useful. The cadence of the walk, the sounds, the light, the
smell. All the senses are engaged when I’m outside in nature and as a
result, my brain becomes more creative.
</p>
<p>
The next time you’re creatively stuck, if you can, go for a walk in
nature. You won’t regret it.

<p>Today, Florida’s ban on abortions after six weeks—earlier than most
women know they’re pregnant—went into effect. The Florida legislature
passed the law and Florida governor Ron DeSantis signed it a little more
than a year ago, on April 13, 2023, but the new law was on hold while
the Florida Supreme Court reviewed it. On April 1 the court permitted
the law to go into operation today.</p>

Distributed PostgreSQL Introduces Automatic DDL Replication and
Snowflake Sequences for Postgres</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-02, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
New capabilities advance state of the art in Postgres logical
replication
</p>
<p>
Alexandria, VA - April 17, 2024 - pgEdge, Inc., the leading company
dedicated to distributed Postgres, today unveiled two major advances in
logical replication for the widely adopted open-source PostgreSQL
database. These are automatic DDL (Data Definition Language)
replication, and snowflake sequences, an innovative solution to the
problem of maintaining unique sequence identifiers across a distributed
Postgres cluster. pgEdge Distributed PostgreSQL is the first and only
fully distributed PostgreSQL database solution that is open (source
available) and completely based on the PostgreSQL database itself.
</p>
<p>
Automatic Replication of DDL Commands. DDL is used to create and modify
Postgres objects like tables, indexes, views and constraints through
command statements like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP. DML (data manipulation
language) is used to perform operations on the data within those
database objects through command statements such as SELECT, INSERT,
UPDATE, and DELETE.
</p>
<p>
Traditionally, logical replication in Postgres only allowed for the
replication of DML statements and not DDL. Manual efforts were required
on each node to modify table definitions through DDL commands that had
to be executed on every node.
</p>
<p>
With the introduction of automatic DDL replication on pgEdge, developers
can now update the database schema on a single node and have it
automatically propagated to other nodes in the cluster. This feature
makes it far easier to support distributed Postgres applications where
the database schema is frequently updated because of active development
or maintenance.
</p>
<p>
Snowflake Sequence in Postgres Extension: Managing sequences in a
distributed PostgreSQL environment can be complex, especially in
multi-master replication scenarios. A Postgres sequence provides a
unique integer number to use as an ID for the database table and its
records. If you insert new records it will assign the next number in the
sequence without issue.
</p>
<p>
In a distributed application, however, the sequence must be updated
across different regions and if each node updates the sequence
independently you will have conflicts that cannot be resolved. For
example, if a sequence is being used as a primary key, the next value of
the sequence on a node in the US could be selected at the exact same
time the next value of the sequence is selected on a node in Australia,
resulting in a primary key conflict.
</p>
<p>
To address this challenge, pgEdge has integrated snowflake sequences
into a Postgres extension. A snowflake sequence allows for the
utilization of a guaranteed unique sequence within a cluster without the
need for application code or schema modifications. By automatically
installing the Snowflake extension in pgEdge Platform and pgEdge Cloud
databases, users can easily maintain unique sequence numbers across
different regions, eliminating conflicts and enhancing scalability.
</p>
<p>
An exclusive presentation and paper on the Snowflake extension will be
showcased at the Silicon Valley Postgres conference in San Jose this
week.
</p>
<p>
“By offering these cutting-edge capabilities built on open,
standard-based Postgres, we demonstrate our ongoing commitment to making
advanced distributed Postgres capabilities available to the Postgres
community. Our goal is to make it easier and faster to deliver
distributed Postgres applications that are always on, always available
and always responsive,” remarked Phillip Merrick, Co-founder and CEO of
pgEdge.
</p>
<p>
Availability Automatic DDL Replication and Snowflake Sequences are
available now within both pgEdge Platform (self hosted) or pgEdge Cloud
(fully managed cloud service).
