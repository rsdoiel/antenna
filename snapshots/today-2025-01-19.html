I must say, I’m becoming a big fan of Facebook’s new “ad breaks”.
They’re disruptive enough to the infinite scroll that I realize it’s
happening and can close the app. My usage has already dropped by 30%.
</p>
<p>
I find joy in dark patterns that backfire. This is exactly like those
racist policies locking up some products at Walgreens to prevent
shoplifting.

<strong><a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/tiktok/download-all-videos">TIL:
Downloading every video for a TikTok account</a></strong>
</p>
<p>TikTok may or may not be banned in the USA within the next 24 hours
or so. I figured out a gnarly pattern for downloading every video from a
specified account, using browser console JavaScript to scrape the video
URLs and <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">yt-dlp</a> to fetch
each video. As a bonus, I included a recipe for generating a Whisper
transcript of every video with
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/mlx-whisper/">mlx-whisper</a> and a
hacky way to show a progress bar for the downloads.</p>

<h2 id="deepseek-api-docs-rate-limit">DeepSeek API Docs: Rate Limit</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-18, updated: 2025-01-18, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/rate_limit">DeepSeek
API Docs: Rate Limit</a></strong>
</p>
This is surprising: DeepSeek offer the only hosted LLM API I’ve seen
that doesn’t implement rate limits:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
DeepSeek API does NOT constrain user’s rate limit. We will try out best
to serve every request.
</p>
<p>
However, please note that when our servers are under high traffic
pressure, your requests may take some time to receive a response from
the server.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Want to run a prompt against 10,000 items? With DeepSeek you can
theoretically fire up 100s of parallel requests and crunch through that
data in almost no time at all.
</p>
<p>
<p>As more companies start building systems that rely on LLM prompts for
large scale data extraction and manipulation I expect high rate limits
will become a key competitive differentiator between the different
platforms.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-from-red-teaming-100-generative-ai-products">Lessons
From Red Teaming 100 Generative AI Products</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-18, updated: 2025-01-18, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07238">Lessons From Red
Teaming 100 Generative AI Products</a></strong>
</p>
New paper from Microsoft describing their top eight lessons learned red
teaming (deliberately seeking security vulnerabilities in) 100 different
generative AI models and products over the past few years.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Microsoft AI Red Team (AIRT) grew out of pre-existing red teaming
initiatives at the company and was officially established in 2018. At
its conception, the team focused primarily on identifying traditional
security vulnerabilities and evasion attacks against classical ML
models.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Lesson 2 is “You don’t have to compute gradients to break an AI system”
- the kind of attacks they were trying against classical ML models turn
out to be less important against LLM systems than straightforward
prompt-based attacks.
</p>
<p>
They use a new-to-me acronym for prompt injection, “XPIA”:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Imagine we are red teaming an LLM-based copilot that can summarize a
user’s emails. One possible attack against this system would be for a
scammer to send an email that contains a hidden prompt injection
instructing the copilot to “ignore previous instructions” and output a
malicious link. In this scenario, the Actor is the scammer, who is
conducting a cross-prompt injection attack (XPIA), which exploits the
fact that LLMs often struggle to distinguish between system-level
instructions and user data.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
From searching around it looks like that specific acronym “XPIA” is used
within Microsoft’s security teams but not much outside of them. It
appears to be their chosen acronym for
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12173">indirect prompt
injection</a>, where malicious instructions are smuggled into a
vulnerable system by being included in text that the system retrieves
from other sources.
</p>
<p>
Tucked away in the paper is this note, which I think represents the core
idea necessary to understand why prompt injection is such an insipid
threat:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Due to fundamental limitations of language models, one must assume that
if an LLM is supplied with untrusted input, it will produce arbitrary
output.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>When you’re building software against an LLM you need to assume that
anyone who can control more than a few sentences of input to that model
can cause it to output anything they like - including tool calls or
other
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/markdown-exfiltration/">data
exfiltration vectors</a>. Design accordingly.</p>
