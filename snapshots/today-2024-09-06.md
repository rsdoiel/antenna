## Kremlin accuses US of unacceptable pressure on Russian media

date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA

Moscow — The Kremlin on Friday accused the United States of applying unacceptable pressure on Russian media after the U.S. Justice Department charged Russian TV contributor Dimitri Simes and his wife with schemes to violate U.S. sanctions. 


The two indictments were announced just one day after the U.S. took several legal actions against Russia to combat alleged efforts to meddle in the 2024 presidential elections, including charging two employees of the Russian state media network RT and sanctioning RT and its top network editor. 


Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who has said Russia is not seeking to interfere in the U.S. presidential election, told reporters that Washington was trying to ensure that Moscow's own perspective on world affairs was not available to people. 


"Washington continues to try to put pressure on Russia, on Russian citizens, and even on the Russian media, which is engaged in informing both citizens inside our country and world public opinion about what is happening, from our perspective," said Peskov. 


"Washington does not even accept that there should be options out there for anyone to get news from our perspective.  


This is nothing other than blatant pressure. We strongly condemn this stance as unacceptable," he said. 


Moscow still grants accreditation to Western journalists to work in Russia, though many have left since the start of the Ukraine war in 2022 and the arrest of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich on spying charges in March 2023. 


Gershkovich, who denied the charges, was freed in a prisoner swap last month. 


Russia has said it will take retaliatory measures against U.S. media in response to Washington's moves against RT. 


Asked what those measures would be, Peskov said Russia carefully evaluated the editorial policies of various foreign media outlets and would take those factors into account when making any decisions, on what he suggested would be a case-by-case basis.

## When a president swayed the decisions of the Federal Reserve

date: 2024-09-06, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Federal Reserve independence has come into the spotlight recently, with former President Donald Trump indicating he thinks the president should have some influence in the Fed&#8217;s actions. Today, we wind the clock back to when exactly that happened: In 1971, President Richard Nixon devised a scheme to sway then-Federal Reserve Chair Arthur Burns — and the direction of the U.S. economy — in the run-up to reelection. But first: Hiring was weaker than expected in August.</p>

## US IRS enforcement efforts recover $1.3 bln in unpaid taxes, Treasury says

date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA

Washington  — The U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service said on Friday that they have recovered $1.3 billion in unpaid taxes from wealthy individuals under new enforcement initiatives funded by $60 billion in IRS modernization spending from the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act.  


Why it’s important 


Republicans in Congress have long vowed to rescind the 10-year IRS funding passed in 2022, arguing that it would unfairly harass Americans on their taxes. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump vowed on Thursday to rescind all unspent funds from the Inflation Reduction Act, which include billions of dollars earmarked for the IRS.  


The IRS has planned to spend about $10.6 billion of those funds through end of the 2024 fiscal year, which concludes on Sept. 30, leaving nearly $50 billion that could be recouped. But budget forecasters say that doing so would increase the federal budget deficit by more than $100 billion over a decade because the agency would forego stepped-up enforcement.  


By the numbers  


The Treasury said that in the first six months of a new initiative to target 125,000 wealthy individuals who have not filed tax returns since 2017, it has collected $172 million from 21,000 non-filing taxpayers.  


Another initiative to target wealthy individuals with more than $1 million in income and $250,000 in unpaid, recognized tax debts has brought in $1.1 billion to Treasury coffers.   


U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the audit rate for millionaires fell by 80% due to budget cuts at the IRS.  


"During the previous [Trump] administration, as audit rates on high-income taxpayers fell, the share of audits on taxpayers with incomes under $200,000 increased," Yellen said in remarks to be delivered at an IRS service center in Austin, Texas. "In 2019, the top one percent of Americans was estimated to owe over one-fifth of unpaid taxes, leaving ordinary Americans to shoulder the burden."

## US job growth misses expectations in August; unemployment rate slips to 4.2%

date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA

Washington — U.S. employment increased less than expected in August, but a drop in the jobless rate to 4.2% suggested an orderly labor market slowdown continued and probably did not warrant a big interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve this month.  


Nonfarm payrolls increased by 142,000 jobs last month after a downwardly revised 89,000 rise in July, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 160,000 jobs after a previously reported 114,000 gain in July. Estimates ranged from 100,000 to 245,000 jobs.  


The smaller-than-expected increase in payrolls likely does not signal a deterioration in labor market conditions.  


August payrolls have a tendency to initially print weaker relative to the consensus estimate and recent trend before being revised higher later. Hiring typically picks up in the education sector, which is anticipated by the model that the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data.  


The start of the new school year, however, varies across the country, which can throw off the so-called seasonal factors. The initial August payrolls counts have been revised higher in 10 of the last 13 years. Layoffs remain at historic low levels.  


The drop in the unemployment rate followed four straight monthly increases, which had lifted it near a three-year high of 4.3% in July. Early on Friday, financial markets saw a roughly 43% probability of a half-point rate cut at the Fed's Sept. 17-18 policy meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool. The odds of a 25 basis point rate reduction were around 57%.  


Average hourly earnings increased 0.4% in August after falling 0.1% in July. Wages increased 3.8% year-on-year after advancing 3.6% in July. Still-solid wage growth continues to underpin the economy through consumer spending.

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">C3S</small></p><p>“During the past three months of 2024, the globe has experienced the hottest June and August, the hottest day on record, and the hottest boreal summer on record,” said Samantha Burgess, deputy director of C3S. “This string of record temperatures is increasing the likelihood of 2024 being the hottest year on record. The temperature-related extreme events witnessed this summer will only become more intense, with more devastating consequences for people and the planet unless we take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”</p><h3>2. Trump says climate change’s effect on sea levels is ‘not our problem’</h3><p>During a speech at the Economic Club of New York yesterday, former President Donald Trump <a href="https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1831749709767045344?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_pTQPNsAKKkOFIAFl-VsRP5jTA4g3l5MWfvCTGGUJg6rdVoQD_ppEd93AlS2gKkmxx6TGp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that because of climate change, “the ocean is going to go down 100th of an inch within the next 400 years,” and dismissed this as “not our problem.” This appears to be a warped variation of his repeated claim that “the ocean is going to rise one eighth of an inch over the next 400 years.” He’s said this many times, occasionally subbing in “200 to 300 years” for 400 years. Either way, he’s incorrect. “Trump’s numbers are orders of magnitude off the mark,” <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-fact-check?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_pTQPNsAKKkOFIAFl-VsRP5jTA4g3l5MWfvCTGGUJg6rdVoQD_ppEd93AlS2gKkmxx6TGp" rel="noopener" target="_self">wrote Heatmap’s Jeva Lange</a> in her epic historical fact check of Trump’s various climate statements. “The oceans are on track to rise 3.5 feet to 7 feet along America’s coastlines by 2100,” Lange said. Back in 2022, Michael Oppenheimer, director of the Center for Policy Research on Energy and the Environment at Princeton University, <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/nov/17/donald-trump/trump-vastly-understates-how-much-experts-expect-s/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_pTQPNsAKKkOFIAFl-VsRP5jTA4g3l5MWfvCTGGUJg6rdVoQD_ppEd93AlS2gKkmxx6TGp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called</a> Trump’s sea-level calculation “so far from accurate as to appear to have been entirely fabricated.”</p><h3>3. U.S. and China find some common ground during climate talks</h3><p>The U.S. and China had “excellent discussions” during climate talks this week in Beijing, climate envoy John Podesta <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/us-china-still-have-some-differences-climate-finance-us-envoy-says-2024-09-06/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_pTQPNsAKKkOFIAFl-VsRP5jTA4g3l5MWfvCTGGUJg6rdVoQD_ppEd93AlS2gKkmxx6TGp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> today. The two nations came closer to being on the same page about climate finance and greenhouse gas emissions cuts. “Notwithstanding some friction in our bilateral relationship, we can find places to collaborate for the good of our people and the good of our climate,” Podesta said. As <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-06/podesta-says-us-and-china-narrowed-differences-in-climate-talks?srnd=green&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_pTQPNsAKKkOFIAFl-VsRP5jTA4g3l5MWfvCTGGUJg6rdVoQD_ppEd93AlS2gKkmxx6TGp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a>, this is likely the last opportunity for the world’s two biggest emitters to try to find common ground ahead of the U.S. presidential election and the COP29 climate summit in November.</p><h3>4.

## China's halt of foreign adoptions leaves questions about pending cases

date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA

beijing — The Chinese government is ending its intercountry adoption program, and the U.S. is seeking clarification on how the decision will affect hundreds of American families with pending applications. 


In a phone call with U.S. diplomats in China, Beijing said it “will not continue to process cases at any stage” other than those cases covered by an exception clause. The embassy is seeking clarification in writing from China's Ministry of Civil Affairs, the U.S. State Department said Thursday. 


“We understand there are hundreds of families still pending completion of their adoption, and we sympathize with their situation,” the State Department said. 


At a daily briefing Thursday, Mao Ning, a spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said China is no longer allowing foreign adoptions of the country's children, with the only exception for blood relatives to adopt a child or a stepchild. 


She didn't explain the decision other than to say that it was in line with the spirit of relevant international conventions. 


Many foreigners have adopted children from China over the decades, visiting the country to pick them up and then bringing them to a new home overseas.  


U.S. families have adopted 82,674 children from China, the most from any foreign country. 


China suspended international adoptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The government later resumed adoptions for children who had received travel authorization before the suspension in 2020, the U.S. State Department said in its latest annual report on adoptions.  


A U.S. consulate issued 16 visas for adoptions from China from October 2022 through September 2023, the first in more than two years, the State Department report said. It wasn't clear if any more visas had been issued since then. 


In January, Denmark’s only overseas adoption agency said it was winding down operations after concerns were raised about fabricated documents and procedures, and Norway’s top regulatory body recommended stopping overseas adoptions for two years pending an investigation into several cases. 


Beijing's announcement also has followed falling birth rates in the country. The number of newborn babies fell to 9.02 million in 2023, and the overall population declined for the second consecutive year.

## Copper Almost Killed This Arizona Town. Now Copper Could Save It.

date: 2024-09-06, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzU5NTE1NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NDk3NjAzNH0.BxViUYYnzEmUCZvDKJA8l7Ox473Mzv83RQK_oxpUFhU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">In the town of Superior, Arizona, there is a hotel. In the hotel, there is a room. And in the room, there is a ghost.</p><p>Henry Muñoz’s father owned the building in the early 1980s, back when it was still a boarding house and the “Magma” in its name, Hotel Magma, referred to the copper mine up the hill. One night, a boarder from Nogales, Mexico, awoke to a phantom trying to pin her to the wall with the mattress; naturally, she demanded a new room. When Muñoz, then in his fearless early 20s, heard this story from his father, he became curious. Following his swing shift at the mine, Muñoz posted himself to the room with a case of beer and passed the hours until dawn drinking and waiting for the spirit to make itself known. </p><p>Muñoz didn’t see a ghost that night, but he has since become well acquainted with others in town. There is the Mexican bakery, which used to sell pink cookies but now opens only when the late owner’s granddaughter feels up to it. There’s the old Magma Club, its once-segregated swimming pool — available one day a week to Hispanics — long since filled in. Muñoz can still point out where all the former bars were on Main Street, the ones that drew crowds of carousing miners in the good years before copper prices <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/19/business/commodities-worrisome-stagnation-in-copper.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>plunged in 1981</u></a> and Magma boarded up and left town. Now their dusty windows are what give out-of-towners from nearby Phoenix reason to <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g28924-i139-k862433-Hey_Local_Experts_What_s_with_Superior-Arizona.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>write off</u></a> Superior as “dead.”</p><p>“What happens when a mine closes, the hardship that brings to people — today’s generation has never experienced that,” Muñoz told me.</p><p>Superior is home to about 2,400 people, less than half its population when the mine was booming. To tourists zipping past on U.S. 60 to visit the Wild West sites in the Superstition Mountains, it might look half a step away from becoming a ghost town, itself. As recently as 2018, pictures of Main Street were used as stock photos to illustrate things like “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-16/geographic-economic-inequality-is-growing-in-the-u-s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>America’s worsening geographic inequality</u></a>.”</p><p>But if you take the exit into town, it’s clear something in Superior is changing. The once-haunted boarding house has undergone a multi-million-dollar renovation into a boutique hotel, charging staycationers that make the hour drive south from Scottsdale $200 a night. Across the street, Bellas Cafe whips up terrific sandwiches in a gleaming, retro-chic kitchen. The Chamber of Commerce building, a little further down the block, has been painted an inviting shade of purple. And propped in the window of some of the storefronts with their lights on, you might even see a sign: WE SUPPORT RESOLUTION COPPER.</p><p>Resolution Copper’s offices are located in the former Magma Hospital, where Muñoz was born and where his mother died. People in hard hats and safety vests mill about the parking lot, miners without a mine, which is not an unusual sight in Superior these days — no copper has been sold out of the immediate area in over two decades. And yet just a nine-minute drive further up the hill and another 15-minute elevator ride down <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-arizona-copper-mine/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the deepest mine shaft in the country</u></a> lies one of the world’s largest remaining copper deposits. It’s estimated to be 40 billion pounds, enough to meet a quarter of U.S. demand, according to the company’s analysis. </p><p>That’s “huge,” Adam Simon, an Earth and environmental sciences professor at the University of Michigan, told me, and not just in terms of sheer size. </p><p>“Copper is the most important metal for all technologies we think of as part of the energy transition: battery electric vehicles, grid-scale battery storage, wind turbines, solar panels,” Simon said. In May, he <a href="https://www.ief.org/focus/ief-reports/copper-mining-and-vehicle-electrification" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>published a study</u></a> with Lawrence Cathles, an Earth and atmospheric sciences researcher at Cornell University, which looked at 120 years of copper-mining data and found that just to meet the demands of “business as usual,” the world will need 115% more of the material between 2018 and 2050 than has been previously mined in all of human history, even with recycling rates taken into account. </p><p>Aluminum, used in high-voltage lines, is sometimes floated as a potential substitute, but it’s not as good of a conductor, and copper is almost always the preferred metal in batteries and electricity <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/magnets-and-electricity.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>generation</u></a>. Renewables are particularly copper-intensive; one offshore wind turbine can <a href="https://www.energymonitor.ai/tech/renewables/weekly-data-why-keeping-an-eye-on-copper-is-vital-for-the-energy-transition/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>require up to 29 tons</u></a>. What lies in the hills behind Superior, then, represents “millions of electric vehicles, millions of wind turbines, millions of solar panels. And it’s also lots of jobs, from top to bottom — jobs for people with bachelor’s degrees in engineering, mining, geology, and environmental science, all the way down to security officers and truck drivers,” Simon said. He added: “The world will need more copper year over year for both socioeconomic improvement in the Global South and also the energy transition, and neither of those can happen without increasing the amount of copper that we produce.”</p><p>Muñoz insisted to me that the promises of jobs and a robust local economy are a kind of Trojan horse. “Everybody’s getting drunk and having a good time: ‘Oh, look at the gift they brought us!’” he said of Superior’s support for Resolution Copper. “But at night, they’re going to sneak out of that horse, and they’re going to leave an environmental disaster.” </p><p>For now, though, the copper has just one catch: Resolution isn’t allowed to touch it.</p><p><br/></p><p class="drop-caps">If not for a painted sign declaring the ground HOLY LAND, there would be nothing visible to suggest the 16 oak-shaded tent sites over Resolution Copper’s ore body were anything particularly special. The Oak Flat campground is less than five miles past Superior, but at an elevation of nearly 4,000 feet, it can feel almost 10 degrees Fahrenheit cooler. On the late June day that I visited with Muñoz, Sylvia Delgado, and Orlando “Marro” Perea — the leaders of the Concerned Citizens and Retired Miners Coalition — the floor of the East Valley was 113 degrees Fahrenheit, and the altitude offered only limited relief. </p><p>Directly below us and to the east of the campground, beneath a bouldery, yucca-studded desert, lies the copper deposit. At 7,000 or so feet deep, extracting it would require an advanced mining process called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDPLBAA93hc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>block caving</u></a>, in which ore is collected from below through what is essentially a controlled cave-in, like sand slipping through the neck of an hourglass. </p><p>Muñoz, a fifth-generation miner, prefers the metaphor of going to the dentist. “They drill out your tooth and refill it: that’s basically traditional cut-and-fill mining,” he told me. “Block cave, on the other hand, would be going to the dentist and having them pull out the whole molar. It just leaves a vacant hole.” In this case, the resulting cavity would be almost two miles wide and over 1,000 feet deep by the time the ore was exhausted sometime in the 2060s.</p><p>Even four decades is just a blink of an eye for Oak Flat, though, where human history goes back at least 1,500<em> </em>years; anthropologists say the mine’s sinkhole would <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Archaeological-Sites-with-Apache-Affinities-in-the-Oak-Flat-National-Register-Historic_tbl1_322035020" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>swallow</u></a> countless Indigenous burial locations and archeological sites, including petroglyphs depicting antlered animals that Muñoz and Perea showed me hidden deep in the rocks. Even more alarmingly, the subsidence would obliterate Chí'chil Biłdagoteel, the Western Apache’s name for the lands around Oak Flat, which are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2021/04/12/oak-flat-apache-sacred-land/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sacred</u></a> to at least 10 federally recognized tribes. The members of the San Carlos Apache who are leading the opposition effort, and use the location for a four-day-long girlhood coming-of-age ceremony, say it is <a href="https://www.niwrc.org/restoration-magazine/june-2021/oak-flat-chichil-bildagoteel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the only place</u></a> where their prayers can reach the Creator directly. </p><p>Mining and Indigenous sovereignty have been at odds in Arizona for over a century. “The Apache is as near the <em><em>lobo</em></em>, or wolf of the country, as any human being can be to a beast,” <em><em>The New York Times</em></em> wrote in 1859, claiming the tribe was “the greatest obstacle to the operations of the mining companies” in the area. Three years later, the U.S. Army’s departmental commander ordered Apache men killed “wherever found,” the social archaeologist John Welch writes in his eye-opening <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322035020_Earth_Wind_and_Fire_Pinal_Apaches_Miners_and_Genocide_in_Central_Arizona_1859-1874/download" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>historical survey</u></a> of the region, in which he also advocates for using the term “genocide” to describe the government’s policies. That violence still casts a shadow in Superior: Apache Leap, an astonishing escarpment that looms over the town and backs up against Oak Flat, is named for a legend that cornered Apache warriors jumped to their deaths from its cliffs rather than surrender to the U.S. Cavalry. </p><p>As the Apache were being forced onto reservations and into residential boarding schools during the late 1890s, a treaty with the government set aside Oak Flat for protection. The land was later <a href="https://www.resolutionmineeis.us/sites/default/files/project-files/20-fr-7336.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fortified against mining</u></a> by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, with the federal protections reconfirmed by the Nixon administration in the 1960s. (The defunct Magma Mine that fueled the first copper boom in Superior is located just off this 760-acre “Oak Flat Withdrawal Area.”)</p><p>In 1995, the enormity of the Oak Flat ore body — and the billions it would be worth if it could be accessed — started to become apparent. The British and Australian mining companies Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton formed a U.S. subsidiary, Resolution Copper, which bought the old Magma mine and began to lobby Arizona politicians to sign over the neighboring parcel of Oak Flat. Between 2004 and 2013, lawmakers from the state introduced 11 different land transfer bills into Congress, none of which managed to earn broad support.</p><p>Then, in December 2014, President Barack Obama signed a must-pass defense spending bill. On <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206051206/https://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/12/10/re-raiding-native-sacred-places-defense-authorization-everything-wrong-congress" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>page 1,103</u></a> was a midnight rider, inserted by Arizona Republican Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake, which authorized a land transfer of 2,400 acres of Tonto National Forest, including Oak Flat, to Resolution Copper in exchange for private land the company had bought in other parts of the state. (Flake previously worked as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/29/opinion/selling-off-apache-holy-land.html?_r=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>paid lobbyist</u></a> for a Rio Tinto uranium mine, and the company <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/rio-tinto-group/recipients?candscycle=2020&id=D000028746&toprecipscycle=2014" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>contributed</u></a> to McCain’s 2014 Senate campaign.)</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Heatmap Illustration / Esri, TomTom, Garmin, FAO, NOAA, USGS, © OpenStreetMap contributors, and the GIS User Community</small></p><p>The senators’ rider also included an odd little twist. While the National Environmental Policy Act requires the Forest Service to conduct an environmental impact statement for a potential mine, the bill stipulated that the land transfer to Resolution Copper had to be completed within a 60-day window of the final environmental impact statement’s release, <em><em>regardless</em></em> of what the FEIS found.</p><p>After six years of study, the FEIS was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/24/trump-mining-arizona-holy-land-oak-flat-tribes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rushed to publication</u></a> by President Donald Trump in the final five days of his term, triggering that 60-day countdown. President Biden rescinded Trump’s FEIS once he took office in 2021, pending <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2021/03/01/forest-service-delays-oak-flat-land-swap-copper-mine-plan/6875101002/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>further consultation</u></a> with the tribes, but the clock will begin anew once a revised FEIS is released, potentially later this year. (The new FEIS was expected last summer, but the Forest Service has since reported <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mrv2cr6o0eu5wmps2oe5b/USDOJ-Correspondence-to-9th-Cir.-Court_18May2023_Update-concerning-timeline-for-EIS-completion.pdf?rlkey=76tdqz2srs6siz7vh5o1nyzsw&e=1&dl=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>there is no timeline</u></a> for its release. The agency declined to comment to Heatmap for this story, citing ongoing litigation.)</p><p>A spokesperson for Resolution Copper told me that the company is “committed to being a good steward of the land, air, and water throughout the entirety of this project,” and described programs to restore the local ecology and preserve certain natural features, including Apache Leap. “At each step,” the spokesperson said, “we have taken great care to solicit and act upon the input of our Native American and other neighbors. We have made many changes to the project scope to accommodate those concerns and will continue those efforts over the life of the project.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Apache Stronghold — the San Carlos Apache-led religious nonprofit opposing the mine — filed a lawsuit to block the land transfer, arguing that the destruction of Oak Flat infringes on their First Amendment right to practice their religion. The lower courts <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2024/03/01/appeals-court-rejects-bid-to-block-resolution-copper-mine-at-oak-flat/72810397007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>haven’t agreed</u></a>, citing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyng_v._Northwest_Indian_Cemetery_Protective_Ass%27n" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>controversial</u></a> 1988 decision against tribes who made a similar argument in defense of a sacred grove of trees in California. Apache Stronghold, joined by the religious liberty group <a href="https://www.becketlaw.org/case/apache-stronghold-v-united-states/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Becket</u></a>, is now asking the U.S. Supreme Court to hear its case, a decision that is <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2021/03/01/forest-service-delays-oak-flat-land-swap-copper-mine-plan/6875101002/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>expected any day now</u></a>. Nearly everyone I spoke with for this story, however, was pessimistic that the Justices would agree to hear the battle over Oak Flat, meaning the lower court’s ruling against Apache Stronghold would stand.</p><p><strong><br/></strong></p><p class="drop-caps">If Mila Besich could have it her way, Biden would visit Superior. He’d marvel at Apache Leap and Picketpost Mountain, visit the impressive new Superior Enterprise Center — paid for partially with money from his 2021 American Rescue Plan Act — and maybe wrap up the day with a purple scoop of prickly pear ice cream from Felicia’s Ice Cream Shop. And, most importantly, he’d <a href="https://copperarea.com/thank-you-president-biden-please-come-visit-arizonas-copper-corridor/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hear her pitch</u></a>: that “Superior and the state of Arizona have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to be the leader in advancing your green energy strategy.” She says Superior — and America — needs this mine.</p><p>Superior is a blue town, and Besich, its mayor, is a Democrat, which means she has found herself in the awkward position of defending Resolution Copper against colleagues like Congressman Raúl Grijalva of Tucson and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who have introduced unsuccessful bills in Congress to prevent the land transfer. There is something of a bitter irony, too, in seeing her party <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifp9UtoxA3Q" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tout the economic upsides of the energy transition</u></a> while standing in the way of Superior’s mine, which would employ an average of 1,434 workers per year and add over $1 billion annually to Arizona’s economy during its lifespan, according to the FEIS.</p><p>“Every mayor wants more jobs in their community,” Besich told me simply. But, she also pointed out, “Copper is critical to the green economy, so if we want the green economy, we should want to be mining American copper.”</p><p>Superior, of course, isn’t just any town. “Everybody here either worked in the mines or had family that worked in the mines,” James Schenck, a former employee of Resolution Copper who supports the mine and serves as the treasurer for Rebuild Superior, a nonprofit working to diversify the local economy, told me. “They understand the downsides, and some of them, for a while, were having a hard time understanding how this is different than what went on before.”</p><p>Though everyone seems to be on cordial terms — at one point during my visit, I was having lunch with Muñoz and Delgado when Besich walked in, and everyone smiled politely at one another — there are still clear factions. A Facebook group for locals warns against “posts concerning DRAMA, POLITICS, RELIGION, and MINING,” presumably the same topics to be avoided at family Thanksgivings.</p><p>The critical mineral experts I talked to for this story, though, said Schenck is largely right on that point. “Mining in 2024 is radically different than mining in 1954 or in 1904,” Simon told me. “It is really surgical.” </p><p>Muñoz is one of those in town who still isn’t buying it, and has converted his garage into an interpretive center for exposing the perceived infiltrators. As soft classic rock played over the speakers and a fan whirred to keep us cool, he showed me the 3D model he had commissioned of the Oak Flat sinkhole, with a miniature Eiffel Tower subsumed in its crater for scale. Laid out on a table on the other side of the room was a row of six dictionary-thick, spiral-bound sections of the FEIS, their most pertinent sections bookmarked. On the walls, Muñoz had hung pictures of comparable tailings sites in other parts of the world — cautionary tales of the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/MINING-TAILINGS1/0100B4S72K1/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hazards</u></a> posed during the long lifespan of mines. (Including the water demands, <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/09082024/arizona-copper-mining-water-impact/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>no small concern in a place like Arizona</u></a>, which opens a whole <em><em>other</em></em> can of worms).</p><p>“I use my experience to educate the people,” Muñoz said. “This isn’t what it’s made out to be. They’re going to play you.”</p><p>Muñoz was employed at the Magma Copper mine until 1982, when he was 27. “One day they said, ‘We’re shutting down.’ They folded up just like a carnival does on Monday morning,” he recalled. The abrupt departure devastated Superior: <em><em>In These Times</em></em> <a href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/in-an-arizona-town-left-behind-dreams-for-the-future" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>described</u></a> the following years as an “economic cataclysm” for the town. By 1989, the median household income was just $16,118 compared to $36,806 in Queen Creek, the nearest Phoenix suburb just a 45-minute drive away.</p><p>“I witnessed grown men cry,” Muñoz said. “Men who’d been in the mines pretty close to 30 years — they never knew nothing else.” His father, the former boarding house owner, was among them: “He had limited writing abilities and what have you. He was 58. People lost their homes here. They lost their cars. There were divorces. Some people committed suicide. The drinking, the drugs. It was a bad time.”</p><p>Muñoz went on food stamps and unemployment. “This generation that is coming up, they’ve never experienced that,” he said. “They’ve never experienced a repossession note in the mail from the bank. They’ve never experienced a disconnection notice hanging from your front door knob. And they’ve never experienced calling up the utilities and saying, ‘Hey, can you wait until Friday when my unemployment check comes in?’”</p><p>Superior’s story isn’t unique; Arizona’s Copper Triangle is a constellation of hollowed-out company towns. Like many other out-of-work Magma miners, Muñoz eventually found a job at San Manuel, a BHP-owned <a href="https://blog.azgs.arizona.edu/blog/2020-02/when-ground-comes-tumbling-down-subsidence-accompanies-block-caving" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>block cave mine</u></a> about an hour south of Superior. Then, in 1999, copper prices stuttered again, and by 2003, it shut down, too. </p><p>Muñoz had just returned from a car show in San Manuel when we met in his garage, and he reported it was still a sorry sight. “The main grocery store is closed, the Subway, all the buildings are boarded up, and the schools are shut down,” he said. The mine “just abandoned that town.”</p><p><strong><br/></strong></p><p class="drop-caps">Even as Muñoz and the Concerned Citizens and Retired Miners Coalition work with Apache Stronghold and national environmentalist groups like <a href="https://www.hechoonline.org/blog/blog-the-community-must-know-resolution-copper-mines-ugly-truth" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>HECHO</u></a>, the <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/michael-brune/2020/12/save-oak-flat" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Sierra Club</u></a>, and the <a href="https://blog.nwf.org/2024/08/protect-oak-flat-how-to-help/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>National Wildlife Federation</u></a> try to block Resolution Copper’s mine, there is a distinct feeling in Superior of its inevitability. Schenck, the treasurer for Rebuild Superior, told me he suspects just “10% or 15%” of people in town are “against the project.” </p><p>“My personal belief is this copper deposit is going to be developed at some point,” Schenck said. “It’s too important.”</p><p>Besich, the mayor, gave this impression too. “What people need to understand is, this ore body is not going anywhere,” she said. “Someone will mine it in the future.” She views Superior and the copper industry as partners in an “arranged marriage,” and her job as mayor is helping them “figure out how to get along.”</p><p>From the outside, though, Resolution Copper looks more like a sugar daddy. To date, Rio Tinto and BHP have spent <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/arizona-copper-mine-fight-religion-politics-cb06ab89" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more than $2 billion combined</u></a> pursuing the Oak Flat mine, including pumping money into the Chamber of Commerce building, the Enterprise Center, and the fire department. When the town of Kearny, downstream of the mine’s proposed tailings site, needed a new ambulance, Resolution Copper offered <a href="https://copperarea.com/kearny-ambulance-transitions-to-cvrmc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>to help foot the bill</u></a>.

Rio Tinto and BHP “remain committed to influencing U.S. government decisions about the use of public lands and minerals, regardless of additional harms to those lands, to Native Americans, or to National Register historic sites and sacred places,” the archaeologist Welch wrote in his Oak Flat study.</p><p>Rio Tinto is infamous even in the mining industry for its poor history of handling community- and heritage-related concerns. To pick a recent example, the company drew international condemnation for its 2020 destruction of the Juukan Gorge cave in Western Australia, a sacred site to the Aboriginal people that had evidence of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/26/rio-tinto-blasts-46000-year-old-aboriginal-site-to-expand-iron-ore-mine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>continuous human occupation</u></a> going back to the Ice Age. Though Rio Tinto had the legal right to destroy the 45,000-year-old caves, “it is hard to believe community engagement is being taken seriously” by the company, Glynn Cochrane, a former Rio Tinto senior advisor, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230603042713/https://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=c12ebf73-b3ae-41c5-bd40-c884f1495467&subId=687693" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said in a testimony</u></a> in the aftermath.

Tribal members who support the mine or work for Resolution Copper are often cited by non-Native supporters as proof of Apache Stronghold’s supposedly arbitrary defense of Oak Flat.

U.S. copper smelters are <a href="https://www.rosemontminetruth.com/rosemont-will-destroy-santa-rita-mountains-to-export-copper-overseas/#:~:text=There%20are%20only%20three%20smelters%20in%20the%20U.S." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>already at capacity</u></a>, meaning Resolution Copper would likely send much if not all of the raw copper extracted at Oak Flat <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/2022/04/12/resolution-copper-mine-would-destroy-sacred-land-smelt-china/9515287002/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>to China</u></a> for processing. (Rio Tinto’s largest shareholder is the Aluminum Corporation of China.) The spokesperson for Resolution Copper told me that it’s the company’s priority to process the ore domestically, and Rio Tinto does have its own facility in the U.S., the Kennecott copper smelting facility in Utah. Yet it hasn’t committed publicly to processing the Arizona ore there, and it’s far from clear that it even has the capacity to do so. </p><p>For Simon, the University of Michigan professor, that shouldn’t be a deterrent: “If we mine more copper here and it just means we have to export it — who cares?” he pushed back. “If it has to go to China and they smelt it, then you send it to China and they smelt it. Climate is the prize, and if we want to mitigate our impact, we’ve got to do it. There are no ifs, ands, or buts.”</p><p>Oak Flat is also located outside of Superior’s town limits, meaning the community would only recoup about $500,000 in tax revenue, on the high end, from the mine annually, according to the 2021 FEIS — Schenek told me the town’s budget is around $3 million, so it’s hardly insignificant, though it is peanuts compared to the $38 million the state would reap. The FEIS additionally estimated that only about a quarter of the mine’s eventual employees would actually “seek to live in or near Superior;” many would choose instead to commute the hour or so from Phoenix’s Maricopa County. </p><p>Because of technological advances in mining and robotics, the mine also won’t bring back the physical jobs locals remember from the 1970s — by Resolution Copper’s <a href="https://www.hcn.org/issues/48-2/how-a-huge-arizona-mining-deal-was-passed/#:~:text=admitted%20that%20Chavez%20is%20probably%20right" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>own admission</u></a>. Besich, at least, isn’t bothered by this detail: “In all reality, I don’t see my children and their peers wanting to do the manual physical labor that my grandfather, my father, and certainly my great-grandfather did,” she told me. “So the change in technique is good, and I think that it’s actually better for the environment in the long term.” She added that Resolution Copper’s investment in things like local infrastructure and worker training programs will compensate for the comparably insignificant tax revenue the town will otherwise receive, ensuring Superior gets a fair cut of the bonanza.</p><p>What supporters and opponents of the mine can agree on is that Superior must avoid the devastation of the 1980s if or when the Oak Flat mine is exhausted in 40 or more years. Besich and Schenck told me their vision is for Superior to be a town with a mine, not a mining town. But is such a thing even possible? In recent years, Superior has tried to position itself as an outdoor recreation gateway to the many <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/lgnmqx/popular_oak_flat_climbing_sites_in_arizona_are/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climbing routes</u></a> and hiking trails in the area. Yet I struggle to imagine anyone would want to vacation or recreate so close to a massive mining operation. </p><p>Muñoz believes Superior should throw itself entirely into tourism, which brings in three times as much revenue as the copper industry in Arizona. He dismissed arguments that losing the mine this far into negotiations and preparations would set the town <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/pinal/2021/04/14/superior-mayor-mila-besich-says-resolution-copper-mine-necessary-towns-success/7220885002/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>back two decades</u></a>, telling me about a conversation he had with Vicky Peacey, the president of Resolution Copper. “She said, ‘How do I tell my 300-plus employees that they don’t have a job?’” he recalled. “I said, ‘The same way BHP told the 3,300 in San Manuel <em><em>they</em></em> didn’t have a job. Magma Copper didn’t have a problem telling us we didn’t have a job in ‘82.”</p><p>Whatever gets decided about Oak Flat will reverberate far beyond Superior, though. “We’ve got to keep our eyes on the prize,” Simon told me. “And if the prize is mitigating human impacts on climate, and that requires the energy transition, and that requires copper, and we have a potential mine in Arizona that would provide 500,000 tons of copper every year for decades — we need to do that.”</p><p><br/></p><p class="drop-caps">At the end of my day in Superior, I went with Muñoz and Delgado, another former miner, to visit the haunted boarding house. </p><p>The renovated interior was surprisingly beautiful, decorated with period-appropriate details like iron bed frames, clawfoot bathtubs, and lace curtains that softened the harshness of the mid-afternoon light. Though even the FEIS warns that “mining in Arizona has followed a ‘boom and bust’ cycle, which potentially leads to great economic uncertainty,” it was with a pang that I imagined the building one day falling back into disrepair. It, and the town, had survived too much. </p><p>After peeking into Room 103, where Muñoz had passed his tipsy night all those decades ago, we asked the friendly woman working the front desk if she’d had any supernatural experiences herself — surely she’d seen the mattress-flipping phantom, or swinging chandeliers, or perhaps a <a href="https://copperarea.com/white-boots-ghost-magma-mine/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>white-boot miner</u></a> who’d come down from the hills?</p><p>To our disappointment, she shook her head. For now, whatever ghosts there once might have been in Superior had gone.</p><p><em>Editor’s note: This story has been updated to include comment from Resolution Copper.</em><br/></p>

## Venezuela says detained US sailor entered 'without any type of document'

date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA

Caracas, Venezuela  — A U.S. Navy sailor held in Venezuela since late last month was arrested for entering "without any type of document," the South American country's attorney general said Thursday.


An American official on Wednesday announced the sailor had been detained at a time of soaring tensions between Washington and Caracas in the aftermath of disputed elections in Venezuela, with the opposition party claiming it can prove were stolen.


In his first comments on the matter, Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab said the sailor "entered without any type of document, without any means of subsistence for what he came to do in the country."


He said the sailor held dual U.S. and Mexican nationalities.


For its part, the Pentagon said the sailor had been in Venezuela on "personal travel."


"This wasn't something that was authorized," Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters.


"The U.S. Navy is looking into this. We're working with the State Department," she said, adding that: "Of course, we'd like to see the sailor returned home."


Venezuela was rocked by protests after President Nicolas Maduro was declared the winner of a disputed July 28 election, with 25 civilians and two soldiers killed and more than 2,400 people arrested.


The opposition claims it won by a landslide, and the United States, the European Union and several Latin American countries have refused to recognize Maduro's claimed victory without seeing detailed voting results.


On Monday, Washington seized Maduro's plane in the Dominican Republic and flew it to Florida, a move the Venezuelan leader condemned as "piracy" but which Washington said was necessary due to sanctions violations.


The following day, Washington denounced an arrest warrant issued for opposition presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia and warned of further action against Maduro.


The U.S. State Department has warned Americans against traveling to Venezuela for reasons including crime, unrest and wrongful detention.

## In Haiti, Blinken announces $45 million new aid, calls for renewed security mission mandate

date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA

Port-au-Prince, Haiti — During a trip to Haiti on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced $45 million in new humanitarian aid for the Caribbean nation, which has been wracked by violence for years.  


He also called for the renewal of the United Nations mandate for the Multinational Security Support, or MSS, mission to combat the armed gangs that dominate much of the capital.


"At this critical moment, you do need more funding. We do need more personnel to sustain and carry out the objectives of this mission," Blinken told a news conference on a rare visit to Port-au-Prince.


The top U.S. diplomat said he plans to convene a ministerial meeting at the coming U.N. General Assembly to encourage greater international contributions to address Haiti's security, economic, and humanitarian needs.


The MSS mandate is set to expire at the beginning of October.  U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is reportedly exploring the possibility of changing the mission into a traditional U.N. peacekeeping operation, a move that would ease funding, provide more equipment and enable use of military forces rather than only police officers.


Blinken said that while the MSS mission itself needs to be renewed, it also needs to ensure that it is "reliable” and “sustainable."


“A peacekeeping operation would be one such option.  I think there are others,” he told reporters on Thursday.


Blinken's visit to Port-au-Prince underscores U.S. support for Haiti as the country grapples with gang violence.


On Thursday, Blinken met with Edgard Leblanc Fils from Haiti's Transitional Presidential Council.


"Both concurred on the critical need to make timely advancements on election preparations," State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.


Apart from Fils, Blinken also held talks with Prime Minister Garry Conille, MSS head Godfrey Otunge and Normil Rameau, head of the Haitian National Police.


The United States and Canada are the top funders of the MSS in Haiti. The first-year estimated cost for the mission is $589 million. The U.S. has already provided $309 million — $200 million toward the MSS mission base and $109 million in financial support.


Gang-related violence and drug trafficking have fueled political instability and insecurity in Haiti, leading to unbearable conditions for Haitians.


At least 80% of Port-au-Prince is no longer under Haitian authorities’ control, with violence spreading to other parts of the country.


In the past year, displacement in Haiti has tripled as gang violence grips the Caribbean nation. The U.N. says at least 578,000 people have been displaced because of violence, including murders, kidnappings and rapes.


The situation is further exacerbated by widespread hunger, with nearly half the 11.7 million population facing acute food insecurity.


 After Haiti, Blinken arrived in Santo Domingo later Thursday.  His visit follows the start of Dominican Republic President Luis Abinader's second term in mid-August.    


The Dominican Republic will host the 2025 Summit of the Americas, where Western Hemisphere leaders will address shared challenges and policy issues facing the region.

## In Haiti, Blinken pledges $45M in aid, calls for renewal of security mission

date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA

state department — During a trip to Haiti on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced $45 million in new humanitarian aid for the Caribbean nation, which has been wracked by violence for years.


"At this critical moment, you do need more funding. We do need more personnel to sustain and carry out the objectives of this mission," Blinken told a news conference on a rare visit there.


During the visit, Blinken also called for renewing a U.N. mandate for an international security mission to Haiti to fight armed gangs that control much of the country's capital.


The mandate, first approved for 12 months, is set to expire at the beginning of October. Blinken said a U.N. peacekeeping mission could help bring a more sustainable peace to Haiti.


"Much remains to be done, and we're determined to continue," he said. "It's starting to move."


"The Haitian people, not Haitian gangs, will write the country's future," Blinken said.




Blinken's visit to Port-au-Prince underscores U.S. support for Haiti, with additional humanitarian assistance anticipated as the country grapples with gang violence.


On Thursday, Blinken also met with Edgard Leblanc Fils, the head of Haiti's Transitional Presidential Council, in Port-au-Prince, a State Department spokesperson said.


"Both concurred on the critical need to make timely advancements on election preparations," spokesperson Matthew Miller said.


Blinken also will visit the Dominican Republic. His trip to Santo Domingo follows the start of Dominican Republic President Luis Abinader's second term in mid-August.


A senior State Department official told reporters on Wednesday that the United States is prioritizing efforts with its international partners to set up a structure that ensures "a reliable source of financing and staffing" for a security mission in Haiti.


U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is reportedly considering the possibility of transitioning a largely U.S.-funded multinational security force into a traditional U.N. peacekeeping operation.




"A formal PKO [peacekeeping operation] is one of the ways that we could accomplish that, but we're looking at multiple ways to do that," said Brian Nichols, assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs.


With about a month left in the mandate of the U.N.-ratified, Kenya-led Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS) in Haiti, progress has been limited, and many pledges remain unfulfilled.


"The one-year anniversary of the mission is October 2, and we're going to work to ensure that it's poised for success and renewal of its mandate in whatever form that takes," Nichols told VOA on Wednesday.


Multinational security assists police 


Gang-related violence and drug trafficking have fueled political instability and insecurity in Haiti, leading to an unbearable living situation for the Haitian people.


In October 2022, Haiti requested the deployment of an international force to assist the Haitian National Police in combating heavily armed gangs and facilitating humanitarian aid. In October 2023, the U.N. Security Council authorized the MSS.


The United States and Canada are the top funders of the MSS in Haiti. The first-year estimated cost for the mission is $589 million. The U.S. has already provided $309 million — $200 million toward the MSS mission base and $109 million in financial support.




During a visit to Haiti in July, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield announced an additional $60 million in humanitarian assistance for the Haitian people, along with providing armored vehicles for the national police.


Apart from Fils, Blinken met with MSS head Godfrey Otunge and was also to meet Prime Minister Garry Conille and Normil Rameau, head of the Haitian National Police.


Gang violence grips nation


At least 80% of Port-au-Prince is no longer under the control of the Haitian authorities, with violence spreading to other parts of the country.


In the past year, displacement in Haiti has tripled as gang violence grips the Caribbean nation. The United Nations reports that at least 578,000 people have been displaced due to violence, which includes murders, kidnappings and rapes.


The situation is exacerbated by widespread hunger, with nearly half the 11.7 million population facing acute food insecurity.


Gangs, some aligned with political elites, accumulated their control over territory and illicit markets during the tenure of the unpopular former Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who took office after the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in July 2021, according to a Congressional Research Service report.


Henry resigned in April 2024 following the formation of a Transitional Presidential Council.

## Father of Georgia school shooting suspect arrested on murder, manslaughter charges

date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA

WINDER, Ga. — The father of a 14-year-old boy accused of fatally shooting four people at a Georgia high school and wounding nine others was arrested Thursday and faces charges including second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter for allowing his son to possess a weapon, authorities said.


It's the latest example of prosecutors holding parents responsible for their children's actions in school shootings. In April, Michigan parents Jennifer and James Crumbley were the first to be convicted in a U.S. mass school shooting. They were sentenced to at least 10 years in prison for not securing a firearm at home and acting indifferently to signs of their son's deteriorating mental health before he killed four students in 2021.


Colin Gray, 54, the father of Colt Gray, was charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter, two counts of second-degree murder and eight counts of cruelty to children, Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Chris Hosey said at a news conference.




"These charges stem from Mr. Gray knowingly allowing his son, Colt, to possess a weapon," Hosey said. "His charges are directly connected with the actions of his son and allowing him to possess a weapon."


In Georgia, second-degree murder means that a person has caused the death of another person while committing second-degree cruelty to children. It is punishable by 10 to 30 years in prison. Involuntary manslaughter means that someone unintentionally causes the death of another person.


Authorities have charged 14-year-old Colt Gray as an adult with murder in the shootings Wednesday at Apalachee High School outside Atlanta. Arrest warrants obtained by the AP accuse him of using a semiautomatic assault-style rifle in the attack, which killed two students and two teachers and wounded nine other people.


The teen denied threatening to carry out a school shooting when authorities interviewed him last year about a menacing post on social media, according to a sheriff's report obtained Thursday.


Conflicting evidence on the post's origin left investigators unable to arrest anyone, the report said. Jackson County Sheriff Janis Mangum said she reviewed the report from May 2023 and found nothing that would have justified bringing charges at the time.


"We did all we could do with what we had at the time," Mangum told The Associated Press in an interview.


When a sheriff's investigator from neighboring Jackson County interviewed Gray last year, his father said the boy had struggled with his parents' separation and often got picked on at school. The teen frequently fired guns and hunted with his father.


"He knows the seriousness of weapons and what they can do, and how to use them and not use them," Colin Gray said according to a transcript obtained from the sheriff's office.


The teen was interviewed after the sheriff received a tip from the FBI that Colt Gray, then 13, "had possibly threatened to shoot up a middle school tomorrow." The threat was made on Discord, a social media platform popular with video gamers, according to the sheriff's office incident report.


The FBI's tip pointed to a Discord account associated with an email address linked to Colt Gray, the report said. But the boy said "he would never say such a thing, even in a joking manner," according to the investigator's report.


The investigator wrote that no arrests were made because of "inconsistent information" on the Discord account, which had profile information in Russian and a digital evidence trail indicating it had been accessed in different Georgia cities as well as Buffalo, New York.


The attack was the latest among dozens of school shootings across the U.S. in recent years, including especially deadly ones in Newtown, Connecticut; Parkland, Florida; and Uvalde, Texas. The classroom killings have set off fervent debates about gun control and frayed the nerves of parents whose children are growing up accustomed to active-shooter drills. But there has been little change to national gun laws.


Classes were canceled Thursday at the Georgia high school, though some people came to leave flowers around the flagpole and kneel in the grass with heads bowed.


Gray was being held Thursday at a regional youth detention facility. His first court appearance was scheduled for Friday morning.


He has been charged in the deaths of students Mason Schermerhorn and Christian Angulo, both 14, and teachers Richard Aspinwall, 39, and Christina Irimie, 53, according to Hosey.


At least nine other people — eight students and one teacher at the school in Winder — were wounded and taken to hospitals. All were expected to survive, Barrow County Sheriff Jud Smith said.


It was the 30th mass killing in the U.S. so far this year, according to a database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in partnership with Northeastern University. At least 127 people have died in those killings, which are defined as events in which four or more people die within a 24-hour period, not including the killer — the same definition used by the FBI.

## Who is alleged Chinese agent Linda Sun?

date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA

washington — Linda Sun, the Chinese American political aide accused this week of acting as an agent of Beijing, rose rapidly in New York state politics on her way to a job as deputy chief of staff to Governor Kathy Hochul.


She climbed the ladder with stints as public relations director to a Taiwanese American member of Congress and an assignment as the deputy chief diversity officer in the office of the previous governor.


But according to the indictment made public this week, she used her position to tamp down public criticism of China's treatment of its Uyghur minority and to prevent interactions between Taiwanese government officials and senior New York state officials.


In return, the indictment alleges, Beijing rewarded her with millions of dollars in bribes and business deals.


Sun and her husband, Chris Hu, were arrested Tuesday, accused of violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act by illegally acting as agents of the Chinese government. Other charges include visa fraud, alien smuggling and money laundering conspiracy. Hu was also charged with conspiracy to commit bank fraud and abuse of identification.


Court appearance


The two naturalized U.S. citizens made their first appearance in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn on Tuesday. During the arraignment, they pleaded not guilty and were released on a combined $2 million bail. They are not allowed to travel outside New York, New Hampshire and Maine.


In a statement shared with VOA Mandarin, Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu dismissed the allegations.


"I am not aware of the specific details. But in recent years, the U.S. government and media have frequently hyped up the so-called 'Chinese agents' narratives, many of which have later been proven untrue," he said.


He added that "China requires its citizens overseas to comply with the laws and regulations of the host country, and we firmly oppose the groundless slandering and smearing targeting China."




Barnard graduate


Sun was born in China in 1983 and moved to the U.S. with her parents at age 5. She is fluent in Chinese.


She got her undergraduate degree in political science from Barnard College in 2006. According to a campus magazine, she first got involved in public service at age 8 by translating forms and filing tax returns for her parents.


She obtained her master's degree in education from Columbia University in 2009, but her path turned to politics.


In 2008, she met Grace Meng, the U.S. representative for New York's 6th Congressional District. Meng was campaigning at the time and was said to be impressed by Sun's energy and initiative.


Sun joined Meng's campaign as public relations director and then became chief of staff for the Taiwanese American congresswoman.


In 2012, Sun became the director of Asian American Affairs and Queens regional representative in the governor's office. She also served as the deputy chief diversity officer in former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's administration from 2018 to 2020 and then was deputy chief of staff to Hochul from 2021 to 2022.


Alleged effort to silence


As a deputy chief diversity officer, she called on ethnic minorities to have a seat at the table through government programs.


However, according to the indictment, Sun sought to silence voices in the U.S. speaking out for China's Uyghur Muslim minority, whom the Chinese government has long been accused of oppressing. She allegedly had an argument with Hochul's speechwriter, who had insisted the then-lieutenant governor should mention the Uyghur situation in China in a Lunar New Year speech to the Chinese American community.


The indictment said Sun successfully prevented Taiwanese government officials, including former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, from interacting with senior New York state officials, while facilitating Chinese delegations' trips to the U.S. with fraudulent invitation letters.


In return for Sun's political assistance, the indictment says, the Chinese government financially rewarded her with millions of dollars and aided Hu's commercial activities in China.


Using the illegal funds, the couple is alleged to have bought a 2024 Ferrari, a $2.1 million apartment in Hawaii and a $3.55 million Long Island single-family home.


Sun and Hu are scheduled to next appear in court on September 25.

## Windows App SDK 1.6 released

date: 2024-09-05, from: OS News

We are proud to announce that version 1.6 of the Windows App SDK is now available! Whether you’re looking for the incredible performance boost and footprint reduction of Native AOT support, enhancements for deploying your package, or quality of life improvements for controls like PipsPager and RatingControl, WinAppSDK 1.6 offers a raft of new features, performance boosts&#160;and structural changes that enable you to make your native Windows apps better than ever before.&#160; The Windows App SDK provides&#160;a rich set of APIs and tools to help you build beautiful and fast Windows desktop apps, including any C++ Win32 or C# .NET app. You can harness the modern controls and polish of WinUI 3, which ships as part of the WinAppSDK, or if you have an existing app that uses Win32 such as WPF, you can take advantage of only the parts of the SDK that you need. The WinAppSDK also stays up to date with frequent and OS-independent releases so your app can always access the latest innovations. ↫ Duncan MacMichael at the Windows Blogs There&#8217;s actually quite a few nice and welcome updates in version 1.6, most prominently the aforementioned Native AOT. This stands for native Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation, and, as the name suggests, compiles your application ahead of time for the architecture it&#8217;s going to run on. This reduces the size of the application package and greatly improves the startup time. Another welcome improvement is that the embedded Edge WebView2 SDK is no longer hard-coded, but a NuGet reference, so developers can choose to use any version of the webview they want, preferably the newest version. There&#8217;s a lot more in here, so if you&#8217;re a Windows developer trying to use the latest set of tools from Microsoft &#8211; this one&#8217;s for you.

## US imposes new sanctions on Russian Arctic gas as Kremlin struggles to find buyers

date: 2024-09-05, from: VOA News USA

London — The United States announced new sanctions Thursday on ships that transport Russian gas from Moscow's Arctic LNG 2 terminal in Russia’s Murmansk region.


The measures target the owners of two LNG tankers, the New Energy and the Mulan. The U.S. State Department said the New Energy had used "deceptive shipping practices, including shutting off its automatic identification system, to load cargo from the U.S.-sanctioned Arctic LNG 2 project."


It comes as a new analysis shows Russia appears to be struggling to find buyers for its liquefied natural gas, or LNG, from its flagship Arctic LNG 2 project amid tightening Western sanctions, forcing Moscow to store the gas in a huge container vessel in the Arctic Sea.




The Arctic LNG 2 project was meant to produce almost 19.8 million metric tonnes of LNG every year to sell primarily to Asian markets, potentially earning billions of dollars for Novatek, the private company that runs the project, and the Kremlin.


Instead, Russia is struggling to sell the gas, according to analyst Tom Marzec-Manser, head of gas analytics at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services. He has been using satellite and ship-tracking data to monitor LNG vessels servicing the Arctic LNG 2 facility.


“So far, we’re aware of three cargoes that have been loaded from Arctic LNG 2 ... and all of them really have not gone anywhere. In recent days, what we’ve seen is that two of them have had to offload their cargo onto this huge floating storage unit that Russia's Novatek has had moored up near Murmansk for over a year and never used — it's also under sanctions. They're offloading these cargoes into the storage unit because they can't find a buyer,” Marzec-Manser told VOA.


He said that storage unit, named the Saam, will rapidly fill up if Russia can’t find buyers, creating a bottleneck and potentially forcing Novatek to halt production.




Putin’s flagship


Arctic LNG 2 was a flagship development for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who pledged that it would one day help Russia to become the world’s biggest producer of LNG.


“Production of liquefied natural gas in the Russia Arctic zone will have increased three-fold by 2030, up to 64 million tons per year. … Of course, it will contribute significantly in the development of our northern regions and in the strengthening of Russian technological sovereignty,” Putin told delegates at the Eastern Economic Forum in the Russian city of Vladivostok in September 2023.


Earlier sanctions


That goal now seems unlikely. The West, led by the United States, imposed sanctions on Novatek and businesses linked to Arctic LNG 2 following Moscow’s February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Crucially, according to Marzec-Manser, that included the vessels intended to transport the gas.


“So, there's a whole fleet of cargo vessels that are sitting in shipyards in Asia, which are specifically designed to flow through the Arctic seas. They're called ‘ice-class’ vessels, and they've not been able to sell them to Novatek because of these sanctions,” Marzec-Manser said.


“What Novatek then did was to say, ‘Right, what we're going to try and do is buy really old LNG vessels, which aren't designed for the Arctic waters, but we can at least shuttle them backwards and forwards during the summer months.’ But then the U.S. has sanctioned those vessels, as well,” he told VOA.


Kremlin response


Russia is looking for ways to circumvent the sanctions. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in April that “attempts to squeeze Russia out of energy markets and switch to more expensive markets are continuing,” adding that Moscow “will look for ways to overcome these illegal obstacles, unfair competition and illegal actions.”


Analysts say Russia is assembling a so-called “dark fleet” of LNG vessels that are difficult to track.


“It's a game of cat and mouse, and as we see, new vessels which are owned by unknown Middle Eastern entities entering Russian waters, it's only then that you can properly join the dots to say, well, this is clearly being used to service some of these [LNG] projects, and it's only then that the sanctions come in,” Marzec-Manser told VOA.


Novatek did not respond to VOA requests for comment.


Russia is still able to sell LNG and other hydrocarbon products from oil and gas fields that are not subject to Western sanctions. However, the state-owned gas giant Gazprom recorded a net loss of $6.9 billion in 2023 — its first annual loss in more than 20 years — as Moscow cut supplies to European customers following the invasion of Ukraine and the West’s imposition of sanctions.


The United States is now by far the world’s biggest supplier of LNG, with two-thirds of it exported to Europe.

## US warns Russian hackers: 'We are onto you'

date: 2024-09-05, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The United States has charged five Russian intelligence officers and one Russian civilian in connection with a major cyberattack, described by U.S. prosecutors as the first shot in the Kremlin's war against Ukraine.


The Justice Department unsealed the superseding indictment Thursday, accusing the Russians of carrying out the January 2022 "WhisperGate" malware attack that sought to debilitate Ukraine's civilian infrastructure ahead of the Russian invasion the following month.


"The WhisperGate campaign included the targeting of civilian infrastructure and Ukrainian computer systems wholly unrelated to the military or national defense, that include government agencies responsible for emergency services in Ukraine, the judiciary, food safety and education, seeking to sap the morale of the Ukrainian public," said U.S. Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen.


The attack "could be considered the first shot of the war," said FBI Special Agent in Charge Bill DelBagno, speaking alongside Olsen during a news conference in Baltimore, Maryland.


DelBagno said the WhisperGate campaign also targeted the United States and dozens of NATO allies, going as far as to infiltrate a U.S. government agency based in Maryland while simultaneously accessing U.S. bank accounts.


"The FBI, along with our law enforcement partners and allies, will relentlessly hunt down and counter these threats," he said. "This type of cyber warfare will not be tolerated. The scope of Russia's crimes cannot be ignored."


Thursday's superseding indictment, the result of an FBI operation named “Toy Soldier,” builds on charges first filed in June against 22-year-old Russian Amin Stigal, a civilian accused of leveraging malware to aid Russian intelligence ahead of the invasion of Ukraine.


As part of the attack, Stigal and the agents with Unit 21955 of Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff, or GRU, used the cyberinfrastructure of some U.S.-based companies to launch what first appeared to be ransomware attacks, but which were actually designed to wipe out critical data.




The new indictment names Stigal’s Russian GRU accomplices as Vladislav Borovkov, Denis Denisenko, Yuriy Denisov, Dmitriy Goloshubov and Nikolay Korchagin.


FBI officials said the GRU unit has also operated under the names Cadet Blizzard, Ember Bear and Dev-0586, carrying out cyberattacks on critical infrastructure across Europe, Central America and Asia.


In addition to the new charges, U.S. officials said they are offering a reward of up to $10 million for each of the Russians named in the criminal complaint.


The officials said they are also working with Interpol to serve notices that could help lead to the arrest of the six Russians.


"They are marked people," Olsen said. "We know who they are. There's a reward on their head, and we're going to pursue them relentlessly."


"The message is clear," he said. "To the GRU, to the Russians, we are onto you."


In addition to the charges, the FBI and its partners on Thursday issued a cybersecurity advisory telling organizations and companies to fix known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by the GRU's Unit 21955.


The Russian Embassy in Washington has yet to respond to a VOA request for comment.


A key Ukrainian official praised the U.S. indictments and the multinational work that helped make it possible.


"This is a very vivid example of how cooperation, international joint work will and actually can facilitate in this effort to struggle with such a strong and unfortunately quite big enemy as Russia,” said Ivan Kalabashkin, the deputy head of Cyber for the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU).


Kalabaskin, speaking at a cybersecurity conference in Washington Thursday, said Ukraine is suffering from between 10 and 15 major Russian cyberattacks a day, warning the threat is unlikely to diminish.


“The Russians are working very thoroughly on building their offensive [cyber] capacities,” he said. “They are teaching their students at the university, the civil universities, how to attack systems … how to attack infrastructure.”


Meanwhile, some U.S. allies announced their own plans to crack down on Russian intelligence.


Estonia on Thursday announced it has attributed a 2020 cyberattack on three of its government ministries and is seeking the arrest of three members of the GRU's Unit 21955.


"Russia's aim was to damage national computer systems, obtain sensitive information and strike a blow against our sense of security," Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said in a statement.


"Estonia condemns any malign activity, including cyberactivity that threatens our institutions, our citizens and our security," Tsahkna said.


Thursday's charges by the U.S. against Russian agents are the latest in a series of measures by Washington to crack down on what it describes as Moscow's malign activity.


Earlier Thursday, the U.S. Justice Department charged a U.S. television presenter for Channel One Russia and his wife with sanctions evasion.




On Wednesday, the U.S. charged two Russian nationals employed by the Kremlin-backed RT media outlet with funneling almost $10 million to a U.S.-based media company to spread pro-Russian disinformation.




The Justice Department on Wednesday also announced the takedown of 32 internet domains linked to what officials described as a separate Russian operation aimed at influencing the U.S. presidential election.

## A Windows Control Panel retrospective amidst a concerning UX shift

date: 2024-09-05, from: OS News

Unsurprisingly, this change has not been met with a lot of enthusiasm by the average Windows user, and with Microsoft now&#160;officially recommending users migrate over to the Settings app, it seems that before long we may have to say farewell to what used to be an intrinsic part of the Windows operating system since its first iterations. Yet bizarrely, much of the Control Panel functionality doesn’t exist yet in the Settings app, and it remain an open question how much of it can be translated into the Settings app user experience (UX) paradigm at all. Considering how unusual this kind of control panel used to be beyond quaint touch-centric platforms like Android and iOS, what is Microsoft’s goal here? Have discovered a UX secret that has eluded every other OS developer? ↫ Maya Posch I like the Windows Control Panel, and approaches like it. They&#8217;re easy to use, they allow you to have multiple settings panels open at the same time, they can be easily extended by third parties &#8211; for better or worse &#8211; and they make it easy to find things with colourful, recognisable icons. The current Windows Settings application is a massive regression, as is the change from macOS&#8217; iconic and incredibly user-friendly System Preferences to the new System Settings application. KDE also moved to a sidebar design I&#8217;m not a fan of, and GNOME has had a similar unpleasant, monochrome sidebar, too. It&#8217;s not big enough of an issue to make a huge deal out of, and the KDE sidebar settings application is at least marginally usable, but I really do wish someone would have the guts to undo this general trend, because it&#8217;s getting harder and harder to find the settings I want at a glance, and not allowing you to open multiple settings panels at the same time is a huge loss. And a small note: this article uses the Windows 3.x Control Panel as its starting point, but both Windows 1.x and 2.x had a Control Panel as well. It&#8217;s an old concept, for sure.

## The Internet Archive just lost its appeal over ebook lending

date: 2024-09-05, from: OS News

The Internet Archive has lost its appeal in a fight to lend out scanned ebooks without the approval of publishers. In a&#160;decision on Wednesday, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that permitting the Internet Archive’s digital library would “allow for widescale copying that deprives creators of compensation and diminishes the incentive to produce new works.” The decision is another blow to the nonprofit in the&#160;Hachette v. Internet Archive&#160;case. In 2020, four major publishers — Hachette, Penguin Random House, Wiley, and HarperCollins —&#160;sued the Internet Archive&#160;over claims its digital library constitutes “willful digital piracy on an industrial scale.” ↫ Emma Roth If you&#8217;re a library and scan books and offer a lending service, you&#8217;re committing &#8220;willful digital piracy on an industrial scale&#8221;. If you scan the entire goddamn internet without any regard for licensing or copyright and regurgitate chunks of it on command, you&#8217;re a visionary, a revolutionary, a genius.

And when that first prototype reactor turns on, the feverish headlines about harnessing the power of the sun and the stars here on Earth will at least be somewhat justified. Fusion is going to be a massive scientific achievement, but in a practical sense, it might not matter.</p><p>“We can make it work,” Egemen Kolemen, fusion expert and associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Princeton University, told me. “But at what price?”</p><p>Figuring out fusion is one thing, penciling out the economics another. There’s a nontrivial chance that fusion could become a scientific reality but remain too expensive to make a dent in the barriers to decarbonization. </p><p>How this plays out largely depends on what the grid looks like by the mid-2030s, when the leading fusion startups think we’ll see the first demonstration reactors come online. President Biden wants to fully decarbonize the electricity sector by 2035. And as ambitious — or, as many say, unrealistic — as that may be, how close we get and how we get there will determine what opportunities remain for fusion.</p><p>By the mid-2030s, the cost of building new fission reactors could come down significantly; if The Nuclear Company <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/the-nuclear-company-reactors" target="_self"><u>has its way</u></a>, we’ll have built a 6 gigawatt fleet of standard nuclear plants by then. Or maybe <a href="https://heatmap.news/terrapower-bill-gates-nuclear" target="_self"><u>small, modular reactors</u></a> will finally prove out, squeezing much of the market space for fusion. And then there’s all the other emergent, grid-firming tech in various stages of development. Think <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/battery-hydrostor-nostromo-energy-vault" target="_self"><u>long-duration battery storage</u></a>, <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/fervo-energy-tim-latimer-drilling-costs" target="_self"><u>enhanced geothermal</u></a>, and hydrogen for starters.</p><p>“Batteries go down in price, hydrogen goes down, you know, two orders of magnitude, whatever. And then you say, we’re okay, we don’t need an extra [energy] source,” Kolemen told me. “So we have to be very clear that that’s an option as well.”</p><p>Needless to say, investors know it’s a gamble. “This is venture, of course there’s a chance that it might not be economically feasible,” Gabriel Kra, managing director and co-founder at climate tech VC Prelude Ventures, told me. “That’s not a reason, in any case, not to try.” Prelude Ventures has invested in two fusion companies, Thea Energy and Xcimer Energy, while venture capitalists on the whole have poured $6.7 billion into fusion since 1992, <a href="https://www.fusionindustryassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-global-fusion-industry-report-FIA.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according to the Fusion Industry Association</u></a>, the vast majority of that in the past three years.</p><p>Many of these same venture firms are also placing big bets on other energy solutions that promise to provide many of the same benefits as fusion, such as <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/fervo-energy-tim-latimer-drilling-costs" target="_self"><u>Fervo</u></a>’s enhanced geothermal tech, or Koloma’s artificial intelligence-powered <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/hydrogen/the-245m-bid-to-pull-clean-hydrogen-straight-from-the-earth" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>geologic hydrogen</u></a> detection system, or <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91030532/ess-most-innovative-companies-2024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Form Energy’s</u></a> long-duration iron-air batteries. But because none of these brand new technologies has yet achieved meaningful scale, creating simple price forecasts or cost curve models isn’t possible. </p><p>A refrain I heard a few times, however, is that no matter the energy mix of the future, fusion’s viability isn’t simply a matter of dollars and cents. “Even if fusion doesn’t get as cheap as solar or wind, or even if it doesn’t get as cheap as natural gas, there’s still a huge place for it in the grid,” Kra said. </p><p>Siting fusion reactors near dense urban areas, for example, could help solve one of the principal issues with renewables. “Even now, it’s becoming difficult to find sites for solar and wind, and we have a fraction of what we would need,” Jacob Schwartz, a staff research physicist at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, told me. “If you really want a lot of firm power that can be much physically denser than these other resources, you might really want to build fusion.” Siting fusion next to demand centers would also reduce the need to permit and build long transmission lines, which can take <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/average-lead-times-to-build-new-electricity-grid-assets-in-europe-and-the-united-states-2010-2021" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a decade or more</u></a> if it happens at all. </p><p>Of course, fission reactors have these advantages too. A paper Schwartz and Kolemen<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435123000752?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=8be295e88de9c387" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u> published last year</u></a>, modeling fusion’s place in various net-zero grid scenarios from 2036 to 2050, found that in most of them, fusion plants would be primarily displacing fission. That is, if they made sense at all. The authors (including Princeton energy systems professor and Heatmap contributor Jesse Jenkins) also found that if the price of competing technologies creates at least a moderate market opportunity for fusion, we could wind up with 100 gigawatts or more of fusion capacity, about the size of the current domestic fission fleet. But if other technologies outperform and drop significantly in price, it’s possible that no commercial fusion plants would get built in that timeframe. </p><p>Kra, however, disagrees with a core assumption of the paper — that the U.S. will actually meet our carbon-free energy targets. “I don’t want to be a doomer, but I don’t think we’re going to decarbonize the grid by 2035,” Kra told me. “I think the first fusion plant that comes online, maybe between 2035 and 2040, will be displacing a fossil source at that moment in time.” </p><p>Looked at that way, the calculus changes. Fusion could become just another player in the renewables mix, slotting in alongside a plethora of other emergent and established carbon-free technologies to supplant fossil fuels in an all-of-the-above march towards zero emissions. It would still need to be cost-effective, of course, but if it’s framed as a possible successor to fossil fuels as opposed to a rival of existing clean energy sources, that’s a much better sales pitch.</p><p>That said, it’s going to take more than just reaching cost-parity with fission for fusion to take off. If that’s all we do, Kolemen told me, “it will have the exact same result, which is that nothing is going to be built.”</p><p>And even if fusion doesn’t end up penciling out for the U.S. grid, it may still in other areas of the world with less abundant renewable energy resources and rapid load growth. Phil Larochelle, the leader of Breakthrough Energy Ventures fusion investment strategy, told me that it’s really not the West that stands to benefit the most. </p><p>“You’ve got the rest of the world — call it, 80% of the world's population — who are trying to live a life of prosperity, like we do here.” But raising standards of living around the world means a huge increase in energy consumption. “And so then the question is, can you just kind of sneak across the finish line with wind, solar, storage, transmission, geothermal, a bit of natural gas?” Larochelle asked. While he said it should be possible, it wouldn’t allow for the flourishing vision of the future that he hopes to see. “Sustainable abundance for all. That’s, I think, where fusion really shines,” he told me.</p>

## Porting systemd to musl libc-powered Linux

date: 2024-09-05, from: OS News

A. Wilcox, the original creator of Adélie Linux, has ported systemd to musl, the glibc alternative. I have completed an initial new port of systemd to musl. This patch set does not share much in common with the existing OpenEmbedded patchset. I wanted to make a fully updated patch series targeting more current releases of systemd and musl, taking advantage of the latest features and updates in both. I also took a focus on writing patches that could be sent for consideration of inclusion upstream. The final result is a system that appears to be surprisingly reliable considering the newness of the port, and very fast to boot. ↫ A. Wilcox I absolutely adore Adélie Linux as a project, even if I don&#8217;t run it myself, since they have a very practical approach to software. Systemd is popular for a reason &#8211; it&#8217;s fast and capable &#8211; and it only makes sense for Adélie to offer it as a potential option, even when using musl. Choice is a core value of the open source and Linux world, and that includes the choice to use systemd, even for a distribution that has traditionally used something else. The port is already quite capable, and Wilcox managed to replace OpenRC on her system with systemd in-place, and it booted up just fine, and it also happened to boot in about a third of the time OpenRC did. It&#8217;s not ready for prime time yet, though, and most services are not yet packaged for systemd, an effort for which Adélie Linux intends to rely on upstream and cooperation with systemd experts from Gentoo and Fedora. They&#8217;re also working together with systemd, musl, and others to make any switching a user might want to do as easy as possible. A beta or anything like that is still a ways off, but it&#8217;s an impressive amount of progress already.

## Hunter Biden pleads guilty to federal tax charges to spare his family

date: 2024-09-05, from: VOA News USA

Los Angeles — President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, pleaded guilty Thursday to federal tax charges, a surprise move he said was meant to spare his family another painful and embarrassing criminal trial after his gun case conviction just months ago.


Hunter Biden's decision to plead guilty to misdemeanor and felony charges without the benefits of a deal with prosecutors came hours after jury selection was supposed to begin in the case accusing him of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes.


The president's son is facing potential prison time after his June conviction on felony gun charges in a trial that aired unflattering and salacious details about his struggles with a crack cocaine addiction. The tax trial was expected to showcase more potentially lurid evidence as well as details about Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, which Republicans have seized on to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt.


"I will not subject my family to more pain, more invasions of privacy and needless embarrassment," Hunter Biden said in an emailed statement after he entered his plea. "For all I have put them through over the years, I can spare them this, and so I have decided to plead guilty."


Although President Biden's decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential election muted the potential political implications of the tax case, the trial was expected to carry a heavy emotional toll for the president in the final months of his five-decade political career.


"Hunter put his family first today, and it was a brave and loving thing for him to do," defense attorney Abbe Lowell told reporters outside the federal courthouse in Los Angeles.


Hunter Biden, 54, quickly responded "guilty" as the judge read out each of the nine counts. The charges carry up to 17 years behind bars, but federal sentencing guidelines are likely to call for a much shorter sentence. He faces up to $1.35 million in fines.


Sentencing is set for December 16 in front of U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi, who was nominated to the bench by former President Donald Trump.


He faces sentencing in the Delaware case on Nov. 13 — the week after the general election. Those charges are punishable by up to 25 years in prison, though he is likely to get far less time or avoid prison entirely.


Hunter Biden showed no emotion as he walked out of the courthouse holding his wife's hand. He ignored questions shouted at him by reporters before climbing into an SUV and driving off.

## US-China rivalry on display at gathering of Pacific Islands leaders

date: 2024-09-05, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Efforts by Beijing to limit Taiwan's participation in the recently concluded Pacific Islands Forum underscore the intense and ongoing tug-of-war between Western democracies and China for influence in the region, analysts say.


During the Pacific Islands Forum, or PIF, which wrapped up Friday, Beijing ally Solomon Islands tried unsuccessfully to block Taiwan from future participation. Then, on Saturday, the PIF removed a reference to Taiwan in its final communique after Beijing's top Pacific diplomat expressed outrage at its inclusion.


The communique originally reaffirmed a 30-year-old agreement allowing Taiwan to take part in the PIF. That wording was later removed. Beijing's communist leaders insist that democratically ruled Taiwan is a part of China and have worked for decades to limit the island's participation in international organizations.


After the references to Taiwan were removed, Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday, "Taiwan issued the strongest condemnation on China's arbitrary intervention and unreasonable actions that undermine regional peace and stability.”


However, the ministry said the revision did not undermine Taiwan’s status at the forum or prevent it from participating in the future.


Asia Group senior adviser Kathryn Paik, who helped lead the creation of the first U.S.-Pacific Islands Forum Summit while at the U.S. National Security Council, said that while Taiwan's status as a development partner is still solid, what happened highlights the intensity of Beijing's efforts in the region.


"China has made gaining access and influence in the Pacific a top priority in recent years, sending savvy diplomats to the region. In fact, China currently has vastly more diplomats on the ground in more countries than the United States, outnumbering the U.S. in almost every location," Paik told VOA. "The pushback on the Solomon Islands' attempt — which was transparently an attempt by China — to remove Taiwan as a development partner to the PIF demonstrated the high regard that many nations have for Taiwan's contributions to Pacific development."


PIF officials did not explain why Taiwan was removed from the communique but stressed that the PIF would continue to welcome Taiwan at its regional meetings.




Nikkei Asia reported that Chinese Special Envoy for the Pacific Qian Bo told reporters Friday the reference was “a mistake” that “should be corrected.”


"Taiwan is part of China. Taiwan is not a dialogue partner of PIF, so China has the representation on behalf of the whole China, including Taiwan and the mainland," Qian said.


VOA reached out to the Chinese Embassy in Washington and the Solomon Islands for comment but has yet to receive a response.


Partnership through 2027


On Sunday, Taiwan announced an agreement with the Pacific Islands to extend the development partnership through 2027, according to a Foreign Ministry statement.


The statement also highlighted programs Taiwan has supported in the Pacific Islands, efforts that have focused on areas such as agriculture, education, medical care, communications technology, women's empowerment and basic infrastructure.


Commenting Tuesday on China's efforts at the PIF, the U.S. State Department backed Taiwan's continued right to attend regional meetings.


"The PRC's efforts to pressure Pacific Island countries to remove this reference fit a pattern of PRC coercion to constrain Taiwan's international position," a State Department spokesperson told VOA, using an abbreviation of the country’s formal name, the People’s Republic of China. "Taiwan is a highly capable, engaged, democratic and responsible member of the global community."


US Pacific territories


While China and the United States maintain status as partner nations in the PIF, U.S. territories Guam and American Samoa were granted status as associate members during last week's meetings. Although they do not have voting rights, they will be able to provide speakers at plenary sessions and nominate members to PIF working groups.


"The United States supports the U.S. Pacific territories' increased participation in the PIF and greater connectivity with PIF members," a State Department spokesperson told VOA.


The Asia Group's Paik said that having two U.S. territories "more tightly knit into the Pacific community" further reinforces that the U.S. is a Pacific nation and opens opportunities for the U.S. to influence decision-making at the forum.


Ivan Kanapathy, a former deputy senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council, agrees.


"This will provide more allied voices and reduce PRC influence, which often relies on elite capture," said Kanapathy, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University.


He added: "Washington must convince the region that it is willing to impose real costs on Beijing — more than just diplomatic statements."

## Britain halts criminal proceedings against movie producer Weinstein

date: 2024-09-05, from: VOA News USA

LONDON — Disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein won't face charges of indecent assault in Britain, prosecutors announced on Thursday.


The Crown Prosecution Service, which in 2022 authorized two charges of indecent assault against Weinstein, said it decided to discontinue proceedings because there was "no longer a realistic prospect of conviction.''


"We have explained our decision to all parties,'' the CPS said in a statement. ''We would always encourage any potential victims of sexual assault to come forward and report to police, and we will prosecute wherever our legal test is met."


Weinstein became the most prominent villain of the #MeToo movement in 2017 when women began to go public with accounts of his behavior. After the revelations emerged, British police said they were investigating multiple allegations of sexual assault that reportedly took place between the 1980s and 2015.


In June 2022, the Crown Prosecution Service said it had authorized London's Metropolitan Police Service to file two charges of indecent assault against Weinstein in relation to an alleged incident that occurred in London in 1996. The victim was in her 50s at the time of the announcement.


Unlike many other countries, Britain does not have a statute of limitations for rape or sexual assault.


Weinstein, who has denied that he raped or sexually assaulted anyone, remains in custody in New York while awaiting retrial in Manhattan, prosecutors said in August.


After the retrial, he is due to start serving a 16-year sentence in California for a separate rape conviction in Los Angeles, authorities said. Weinstein was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 while already serving a 23-year sentence in New York.


His 2020 conviction in Manhattan was thrown out earlier this year when the state's top court ruled that the judge in the original trial unfairly allowed testimony against Weinstein based on allegations that weren't part of the case.


Weinstein, the co-founder of the Miramax entertainment company and The Weinstein Company film studio, was once one of the most powerful people in Hollywood, having produced films such as "Pulp Fiction" and "The Crying Game."

	The Biden administration today is expected to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/05/fact-sheet-president-biden-visits-westby-wisconsin-announces-7-3-billion-for-clean-affordable-reliable-electricity-for-rural-america-the-largest-investment-in-rural-electrification-since-the-ne/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--6YipZIHvEJosA2BsAiXthvmTop4nv1U3RldrPDgxn8ivNHR_VO1cTCcwYEXonJG14AKBm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announce</a> $7.3 billion in grants for rural electric cooperatives to finance clean energy projects aimed at bringing reliable, affordable energy to rural Americans. The infusion, which comes from the Empowering Rural America (New ERA) program of the Inflation Reduction Act, is “the largest investment in rural electrification since FDR’s administration,” <a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/biden-announce-largest-investment-rural-091039512.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--6YipZIHvEJosA2BsAiXthvmTop4nv1U3RldrPDgxn8ivNHR_VO1cTCcwYEXonJG14AKBm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> White House Deputy Chief of Staff Natalie Quillian. The 16 cooperatives will have projects dotted across 23 states. The projects are expected to create 4,500 permanent jobs and prevent more than 43 million tons of greenhouse gas pollution each year. Biden will announce the news at the Dairyland Power Cooperative in Wisconsin. Dairyland will receive $573 million for solar and wind installations across Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, and Illinois. “One in five rural Americans will benefit from these clean energy investments, thanks to partnerships with rural electric cooperatives like Dairyland,” said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement. “Put simply, this is rural power, for rural America.”

CEO Jim Rowan blamed market forces, lack of EV charging infrastructure, and lower-than-expected customer demand for the change. The company said it will invest in plug-in hybrids for growth. “We are resolute in our belief that our future is electric,” Rowan said. “However, it is clear that the transition to electrification will not be linear, and customers and markets are moving at different speeds.” The walk-back follows similar moves from other carmakers including Ford. Volvo was one of the first legacy automakers to commit to a fully-electric future, and as the <em><em>Financial Times</em></em> <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7d4d392c-e676-4eb8-84a6-1665b44d0ec8?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--6YipZIHvEJosA2BsAiXthvmTop4nv1U3RldrPDgxn8ivNHR_VO1cTCcwYEXonJG14AKBm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a>, it “remains the most bullish about the transition.”

## Judge permits prosecutors to share fresh evidence in Trump election interference case

date: 2024-09-05, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The federal election interference case against Donald Trump inched forward Thursday, with a judge permitting prosecutors to file court documents later this month that could detail unflattering allegations about the former president as the Republican nominee enters the final weeks of his White House run. 


The order came hours after a court hearing, the first in the case in nearly a year, in which U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan sparred with a Trump lawyer who accused the government of trying to rush ahead with an "illegitimate" indictment in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election. Chutkan made clear she would not let the upcoming election affect how she proceeds, turning aside defense efforts to delay the process while also acknowledging that the case is nowhere close to a trial date. 


"There's no rush to judgment here," Chutkan said. 


Prosecutors and defense lawyers are at odds over the next steps in the case after the Supreme Court narrowed the scope of the prosecution by ruling that former presidents are entitled to broad immunity from criminal charges. The dueling proposals and testy courtroom exchanges Thursday reflected the extent to which the justices' July opinion had upended the path of the case that charges Trump with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 election in the run-up to the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021. 


By day's end, the judge permitted prosecutors to file by September 26 a legal brief that could include fresh details about Trump's failed efforts to cling to power four years ago. The brief is meant to defend a revised and stripped-down Trump indictment that special counsel Jack Smith's team filed last week to comply with the Supreme Court's immunity opinion. The filing is expected to include detailed allegations from the investigation, said Thomas Windom, a member of Smith's team. 


Trump lawyer John Lauro objected to the filing of the brief before the defense team has had a chance to seek the indictment's dismissal — and during the "sensitive time" before the election. 


"This process is inherently unfair, particularly during this sensitive time that we're in," Lauro said. 


That comment drew a rebuke from Chutkan, who said that the timing of the election was "not relevant" to how the case should proceed. 


"This court is not concerned with the electoral schedule," the judge said. At another point, she suggested that the defense was trying to delay the case because of the forthcoming election, cautioning, "That's not going to be a factor I consider at all." 


Trump lawyer suggests indictment 'illegitimate'


The new indictment filed by Smith's team last week removed allegations related to Trump's attempts to use the Justice Department's law enforcement powers to undo the election results, conduct for which the Supreme Court said he enjoyed immunity. But the Trump team believes the new indictment did not go far enough to comply with the 6-3 ruling, in part because it left intact allegations that Trump badgered his vice president, Mike Pence, to refuse to certify the counting of the electoral votes, Lauro said. 


"We may be dealing with an illegitimate indictment from the get-go," Lauro said. 


He told Chutkan that the Supreme Court's opinion required the outright dismissal of the case, a position the judge made clear she did not accept. She bristled again when he suggested that prosecutors were guilty of a "rush to judgment." 


"This case has been pending for over a year," Chutkan said, referencing the fact that the matter has been frozen since last December while Trump pursued his immunity appeal. "We're hardly sprinting to the finish here." 


She added, "We all know — we all know — that whatever my ruling on immunity is, it's going to be appealed. And the taking of that appeal will again stay this case. So, no one here is under any illusion that we're sprinting towards any particular trial date." 


Judge to determine which acts are 'official'


The Supreme Court held that former presidents are immune from prosecution for the exercise of their core constitutional functions and are presumptively immune for all other official duties. It now falls to Chutkan to determine which of the acts in the four-count indictment are official or not and which can remain part of the case in light of the opinion. 


Neither side envisions a trial happening before Election Day, especially given the amount of work ahead. 


Pushing back on the defense's claims that the special counsel wants to move too quickly, Windom noted that Trump's lawyers filed a lengthy brief seeking to overturn his New York hush money conviction and dismiss the case less than two weeks after the Supreme Court's ruling in July. 


"The defense can move comprehensively, quickly and well," said Windom. "So can we."  


Lauro told Chutkan that the case concerned momentous issues. "We are talking about the presidency of the United States," he said. Chutkan shot back: "I'm not talking about the presidency of the United States. I'm talking about a four-count indictment." 


The hearing ended without the judge issuing an order about future dates in the case. 


Trump was not in the courtroom and gave an economic speech in New York, though Smith was present. A not guilty plea was entered on his behalf for the revised indictment. 


Defense lawyers said they intend to file multiple motions to dismiss the case, including one that piggybacks off a Florida judge's ruling that said Smith's appointment was unconstitutional. 


The case is one of two federal prosecutions against Trump. The other, charging him with illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, was dismissed in July by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who said Smith's appointment as special counsel was unlawful. 


Smith's team has appealed that ruling. Trump's lawyers say they intend to ask Chutkan to dismiss the election case on the same grounds, though Chutkan noted in court Thursday that she did not find Cannon's opinion "particularly persuasive."

## Teen charged with killing 4 at Georgia high school had been focus of earlier tips about threats

date: 2024-09-05, from: VOA News USA

WINDER, Ga. — More than a year ago, tips about online posts threatening a school shooting led Georgia police to interview a 13-year-old boy, but investigators didn’t have enough evidence for an arrest. On Wednesday, that boy opened fire at his high school outside Atlanta and killed four people and wounded nine, officials said.


The teen has been charged as an adult in the deaths of Apalachee High School students Mason Schermerhorn and Christian Angulo, both 14, and instructors Richard Aspinwall, 39, and Christina Irimie, 53, Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Chris Hosey said at a news conference.


At least nine other people — eight students and one teacher at the school in Winder, about an hour’s drive northeast of Atlanta — were taken to hospitals with injuries. All were expected to survive, Barrow County Sheriff Jud Smith said.


The teen, now 14, was to be taken to a regional youth detention facility on Thursday.


Armed with an assault-style rifle, the teen turned the gun on students in a hallway at the school when classmates refused to open the door for him to return to his algebra classroom, classmate Lyela Sayarath said.


The teen earlier left the second period algebra classroom, and Sayarath figured the quiet student who recently transferred was skipping school again.


But he returned later and wanted back in the classroom. Some students went to open the locked door but instead backed away.


“I’m guessing they saw something, but for some reason they didn’t open the door,” Sayarath said.


When she looked at him through a window in the door, she saw the student turn and heard a barrage of gunshots.


“It was about 10 or 15 of them at once, back-to-back,” she said.




The math students ducked onto the floor and sporadically crawled around, looking for a safe corner to hide.


Two school resource officers encountered the shooter within minutes after a report of shots fired went out, Hosey said. The teen immediately surrendered and was taken into custody.


The teen had been interviewed after the FBI received anonymous tips in May 2023 about online threats to commit an unspecified school shooting, the agency said in a statement.


The FBI narrowed the threats down and referred the case to the sheriff’s department in Jackson County, which is adjacent to Barrow County.


The sheriff’s office interviewed the then-13-year-old and his father, who said there were hunting guns in the house but the teen did not have unsupervised access to them. The teen also denied making any online threats.


The sheriff’s office alerted local schools for continued monitoring of the teen, but there was no probable cause for arrest or additional action, the FBI said.




Hosey said the state Division of Family and Children’s Services also had previous contact with the teen and will investigate whether that has any connection with the shooting. Local news outlets reported that law enforcement on Wednesday searched the teen's family home in Bethlehem, Georgia, east of the high school.


“All the students that had to watch their teachers and their fellow classmates die, the ones that had to walk out of the school limping, that looked traumatized,” Sayarath said, “that’s the consequence of the action of not taking control.”


Authorities were still looking into how the teen obtained the gun used in the shooting and got it into the school with about 1,900 students in Barrow County, a rapidly suburbanizing area on the edge of metro Atlanta’s ever-expanding sprawl.


It was the latest among dozens of school shootings across the U.S. in recent years, including especially deadly ones in Newtown, Connecticut, Parkland, Florida, and Uvalde, Texas. The classroom killings have set off fervent debates about gun control and frayed the nerves of parents whose children are growing up accustomed to active shooter drills in classrooms. But they have done little to move the needle on national gun laws.




Before Wednesday, there had been 29 mass killings in the U.S. so far this year, according to a database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in partnership with Northeastern University. At least 127 people have died in those killings, which are defined as incidents in which four or more people die within a 24-hour period, not including the killer — the same definition used by the FBI.


On Wednesday evening, hundreds gathered in Jug Tavern Park in downtown Winder for a vigil. Volunteers handed out candles and also water, pizza and tissues. Some knelt as a Methodist minister led the crowd in prayer after a Barrow County commissioner read a Jewish prayer of mourning.


Christopher Vasquez, 15, said he attended the vigil because he needed to feel grounded and be in a safe place.


He was in band practice when the lockdown order was issued. He said it felt like a regular drill as students lined up to hide in the band closet.


“Once we heard banging at the door and the SWAT (team) came to take us out, that’s when I knew that it was serious,” he said. “I just started shaking and crying.”


He finally settled down once he was at the football stadium. “I just was praying that everyone I love was safe,” he said.

## Kamala Harris Has Other Things to Talk About Than Fracking

date: 2024-09-05, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzU4OTU0NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1OTQ2NzQzMH0.-JL0iiBTLKPwVrW6sk_VCBAIjl-AGgLB6R2phW9nTHg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Fracking is just about the last thing Kamala Harris wants to talk about right now, which may be understandable. In a CNN 
	<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/29/politics/harris-walz-interview-read-transcript/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>interview</u></a> last week — her first major sit-down since becoming the Democratic Party’s official nominee for president — she changed her earlier campaign position on whether the technique used to extract oil and natural gas should be banned. Cries of “Flip-flopper!” are a staple of shallow campaign coverage. The issue is a bit complicated, and could prove awkward in at least one battleground state. And she’d rather spend her limited time attacking Donald Trump on abortion and other issues where she has a clearer advantage.
</p><p>
	But when the fracking issue comes up again — and it will — Harris has a great story to tell, one that most Americans are probably unaware of. There’s a green energy revolution underway, but rather than celebrate it, Harris and many other Democratic politicians tend to tiptoe around the issue, apparently terrified that a single infelicitous sentence could turn the supposedly large numbers of pro-fossil fuel voters against them.
</p><p>
	We saw that dynamic in action on CNN, when interviewer Dana Bash homed right in on the fact that, running in the presidential primaries in 2020, Harris said she favored a ban on fracking. “Fracking, as you know, is a pretty big issue, particularly in your must-win state of Pennsylvania,” Bash said. “Do you still want to ban fracking?” Like almost every political reporter, Bash has no interest in the benefits and problems fracking presents, or whether banning it is a good or bad idea. The point is to zing Harris for her apparent flip-flop and speculate on whether it will move votes in one of the few swing states.
</p><p>
	Harris was determined to allay the concerns of any pro-fracking voters tuning in. “I would not ban fracking,” she said. “As vice president, I did not ban fracking. As president, I will not ban fracking.” Loud and clear!
</p><p>
	She did go on to argue that a fracking ban is unnecessary because the Inflation Reduction Act is creating large numbers of green energy jobs, so “we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking.” To the casual viewer, it probably seemed like a perfectly good answer, but it was also somewhat beside the point. The reason many would like to ban fracking isn’t that it holds back the creation of green jobs. It’s that it entrenches our reliance on fossil fuels and creates 
	<a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/fracking-gas-chemicals-health-pennsylvania" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>environmental and health problems</u></a> in the areas where it is deployed.
</p><p>
	Of course, all those considerations — jobs, the environment, and where we’re getting our energy now and in the future — are interrelated. Which is why there is an opportunity for Harris to use that question to focus voters’ attention on the transformation now taking place.
</p><p>
	With one party saying the only thing that matters in energy is drilling for more fossil fuels and the other telling people not to worry because they won’t stop us drilling for more fossil fuels, how many Americans know about the dramatic increase in renewable energy, especially solar, that is now underway? 
	<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=62864" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>According</u></a> to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, nearly 50 gigawatts of solar power will be added to the grid this year, accounting for 59% of all new electricity generation:

</p></center><p>Wind and solar now generate <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/us-wind-and-solar-on-track-to-overtake-coal-this-year/?" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more electricity</u></a> than coal. Even more remarkable is how inexpensive solar power has become. Since 1990, the price per kilowatt hour of a solar panel <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/solar-pv-prices" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has dropped</u></a> by 98%, and solar has become the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/electricity_generation/pdf/AEO2023_LCOE_report.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>least expensive</u></a> type of new energy to generate. With all the innovation taking place in the renewable energy world — a good deal of it spurred by the investments made by the Biden administration — energy prices are likely to keep coming down as more and more of our power is generated by renewables. </p><p>This is a triumphant story of human ingenuity, thoughtful government action, and the operation of the free market. Harris could use it to describe a glorious future of power that is cheap, clean, and nearly limitless, one she is trying to create and Trump is trying to impede. Given that “We won’t go back” is one of her campaign slogans, it would seem like a perfect fit for her. But like many Democrats, she seems wary of saying anything that might spook the relatively small number of people whose livelihoods depend on fracking.</p><p>Consider Pennsylvania, the only swing state where this issue is supposed to matter. From the discussion in the political press, you might think the state’s voters are almost unanimous in their devotion to fracking, but that’s just not true. Even there, the public is closely divided on the issue: <a href="https://www.pghcitypaper.com/news/new-poll-shows-majority-of-pennsylvanians-oppose-fracking-17800496" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Some polls</u></a> have found majorities of Pennsylvanians opposed to fracking, while <a href="https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/32525-how-americans-feel-about-fracking" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>others</u></a> show them split down the middle. And while Pennsylvania produces a lot of natural gas that way, the number of people who actually work in fracking in the state is extremely modest, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/01/1027822/fracking-boom-jobs-industry/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in the low five figures</u></a>. Yet the assumption of news coverage is that the contrast between the Biden administration’s emphasis on clean energy and Trump’s opposite “Drill, baby, drill” approach can only redound to Trump’s benefit; as one <em><em>Wall Street Journal</em></em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/fracking-boom-pennsylvania-trump-biden-voters-a360fd1b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>article</u></a> in April was headlined, “A Pennsylvania Fracking Boom Weighs on Biden’s Re-Election Chances.” The Pennsylvanians who are opposed to fracking because of its environmental impacts — or simply see it as something their state no longer needs — are shoved to the periphery of that kind of coverage. </p><p>So what if the next time she is asked about why she changed her mind about a fracking ban, Harris took the opportunity to explain to people what the future of energy is actually going to look like, and why it’s so encouraging? She’ll have to do that over the objection (or at the very least the indifference) of the reporters covering her campaign, who neither know nor care about the substance of the climate issue or energy policy. But she should do it anyway. Not only would it be right on the merits, it might even be good politics. </p>

Der Chaos Computer Club fordert erneut öffentliche und transparente Wahl- und Auswertungssoftware. Die vorläufige Sitzverteilung im sächsischen Landtag musste nachträglich korrigiert werden, weil die eingesetzte Auswertungssoftware versagt hat. Der Vorgang nährt Misstrauen in das Wahlsystem und führt zur Verbreitung wilder Verschwörungstheorien. Die seit jeher gepflegte Intransparenz gießt Öl in dieses Feuer.

## White House signals it may block sale of US Steel to Nippon Steel

date: 2024-09-05, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The White House is signaling an openness to blocking the acquisition of U.S. Steel by Nippon Steel, as a government review of the proposed takeover by the Japanese company is wrapping up. 


The Washington Post reported Wednesday that President Joe Biden plans to stop the deal from going forward. A White House official, insisting on anonymity to discuss the matter, did not deny the report and said Biden still needs to receive the official recommendation from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). That review could end as soon as this month. 


Biden had voiced his objections to the merger, backing his supporters in the United Steelworkers union who oppose the deal. The objection carries weight as U.S. Steel is headquartered in the swing state of Pennsylvania and is a symbol of Pittsburgh's industrial might in an election year when Republicans and Democrats alike are promising more domestic manufacturing jobs. 


Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, came out against the deal this week. Former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, has said he would block the merger if he were still in the White House. 


Stock in U.S. Steel fell roughly 17% on the news that Biden would stop the merger. 


The CFIUS review process generally pertains to business issues with national security implications. U.S. Steel spokesperson Amanda Malkowski said in an email that the company had not received any update on the process and that the company sees "no national security issues associated with this transaction, as Japan is one of our most staunch allies." 


"We fully expect to pursue all possible options under the law to ensure this transaction, which is best future for Pennsylvania, American steelmaking, and all of our stakeholders, closes," Malkowski said. 


A spokesman representing Nippon Steel said the company had not received any updates from the federal government on the review process. 


U.S. Steel on Wednesday hosted a rally in support of the acquisition. It said in a statement that without the Nippon Steel deal the company would "largely pivot away from its blast furnace facilities, putting thousands of good-paying union jobs at risk, negatively impacting numerous communities across the locations where its facilities exist, and depriving the American steel industry of an opportunity to better compete on the global stage."

## China's envoy not expelled; he left because term ended, says US

date: 2024-09-05, from: VOA News USA

washington — China's consul general in New York left his post as scheduled after completing his posting last month, the State Department said on Wednesday, hours after New York's governor said she asked for his expulsion in the aftermath of the arrest of a former aide who was accused of secretly acting as a Chinese agent.


State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters that Consul General Huang Ping "was not expelled."


"Our understanding is that the consul general reached the end of a regular scheduled rotation in August, and so rotated out of the position, but was not expelled," Miller said.


"But of course, when it comes to the status of particular employees of a foreign mission, I would refer you to the foreign country to speak to it. But there was no expulsion action."


China's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Huang Ping's status.


Governor asked for envoy's expulsion


Earlier on Wednesday, New York Governor Kathy Hochul told an event that she spoke by phone at the request of Secretary of State Antony Blinken to a high-ranking State Department official "and I had conveyed my desire to have the consul general from the People's Republic of China in the New York mission expelled."


"And I've been informed that the consul general is no longer in the New York mission," she said.


Miller said Hochul had spoken on Wednesday to Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell.


Asked by an audience member if she had been interviewed by investigators, including the FBI, Hochul said: "They asked me one question."


"I'm not able to talk about it but it had something to do with identifying whether or not something was my signature and that was it," she said.


Former aide charged 


Linda Sun, 41, a former aide to Hochul, was charged on Tuesday with secretly acting as an agent of the Chinese government in exchange for millions of dollars in compensation and gifts, including meals of gourmet duck.


Sun and her husband, Chris Hu, 40, pleaded not guilty to criminal charges before U.S. Magistrate Judge Peggy Kuo in Brooklyn, after being arrested on Tuesday morning.


Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn said that while working in state government, Sun blocked representatives of the Taiwanese government from meeting with officials and sought to arrange for a high-level New York state official to visit China. In exchange, Chinese government representatives allegedly arranged for millions of dollars in transactions for Hu, who had business activities in China.


Prosecutors said Sun and Hu used the money to buy a 2024 Ferrari Roma sports car, as well as property on New York's Long Island and in Honolulu worth about $6 million.


Hochul was not accused of any wrongdoing. Her office fired Sun in March 2023 after discovering evidence of misconduct and reported Sun's actions immediately to authorities. Her office also has assisted law enforcement throughout the process, a spokesperson for the governor said.


According to the website of China's consulate in New York, Huang Ping had been the consul general since November 2018. Prior to that, Huang, 61, served as a Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe and did stints as an official at the embassy in Washington and China's consulate in Chicago.

## Trump, Harris offer different futures for Ukraine as they vie for US presidency

date: 2024-09-05, from: VOA News USA

Ukraine faces wildly different prospects under a potential Donald Trump or Kamala Harris U.S. presidency. But as their campaigns race to the finish line, neither candidate has laid out exactly how they plan to deal with Russia’s war on Ukraine.  Experts say in that same space of time, the battlefield in Ukraine has itself radically changed, giving more power to Ukraine in determining its own fate. VOA White House correspondent Anita Powell reports from Washington.
