<h2 id="loongson-3a6000-a-star-among-chinese-cpus">Loongson 3A6000: a
star among Chinese CPUs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Computing power has emerged as a vital resource for economies around
the world. China is no exception, and the country has invested heavily
into domestic CPU capabilities. Loongson is at the forefront of that
effort. We previously covered the company’s 3A5000 CPU, a quad core
processor that delivered reasonable performance per clock, but clocked
too low to be competitive. Now, we’re going to look at Loongson’s newer
3A6000 CPU. The 3A6000 is also a quad core 2.5 GHz part, but uses the
newer LA664 core. Compared to the 3A5000’s LA464 cores, LA664 is a major
and ambitious evolution. While Loongson has kept the same general
architecture, LA664 has a larger and deeper pipeline with more execution
units. To sweeten the pie, LA664 gets SMT support. When properly
implemented, SMT can increase multithreaded performance with minimal die
area overhead. But SMT can be challenging to get right. ↫ Chips and
Cheese I’m always fascinated by China’s attempts at catching up to Intel
and AMD, but at the same time, there’s no chance in hell I’d ever use
any of it.</p>

<h2 id="secure-by-design-googles-perspective-on-memory-safety">Secure by
design: Google’s perspective on memory safety</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Google’s Project Zero reports that memory safety
vulnerabilities—security defects caused by subtle coding errors related
to how a program accesses memory—have been “the standard for attacking
software for the last few decades and it’s still how attackers are
having success”. Their analysis shows two thirds of 0-day exploits
detected in the wild used memory corruption vulnerabilities. Despite
substantial investments to improve memory-unsafe languages, those
vulnerabilities continue to top the most commonly exploited
vulnerability classes. In this post, we share our perspective on memory
safety in a comprehensive whitepaper. This paper delves into the data,
challenges of tackling memory unsafety, and discusses possible
approaches for achieving memory safety and their tradeoffs. We’ll also
highlight our commitments towards implementing several of the solutions
outlined in the whitepaper, most recently with a $1,000,000 grant to the
Rust Foundation, thereby advancing the development of a robust
memory-safe ecosystem. ↫ Alex Rebert and Christoph Kern at Google’s blog
Even as someone who isn’t a programmer, it’s impossible to escape the
rising tide of memory-safe languages, with Rust leading the charge. If
this makes the software we all use objectively better, I’ll take the
programmers complaining they have to learn something new.</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>White House — U.S. President Joe Biden is hosting Taoiseach of
Ireland Leo Varadkar on Friday for the annual St. Patrick’s Day
reception at the White House, amid calls to boycott the event by many in
Ireland who are outraged by staunch U.S. support of Israel in its war
against Hamas.</p>
<p>Speaking earlier this week in Boston, where almost a quarter of the
city’s population claims Irish descent, Varadkar cited Ireland’s “own
painful history,” and renewed calls for an “immediate cease-fire” in
Gaza, a step that goes beyond the six-week halt in fighting that Biden
is pushing for. </p>
<p>The Irish prime minister said he intends to warn Biden and
congressional leaders that if the West does not “see and respect the
equal value of a child of Israel and a child of Palestine,” the rest of
the world, particularly the Global South, will ignore calls to uphold
“rules and institutions that are the bedrock of the civilized
world.” </p>
<p>Polls show Ireland, a Catholic-majority European country, is one of
the most pro-Palestinian nations in the world. Many Irish cite their own
resistance against British rule as the reason for their support of the
Palestinian struggle against Israeli occupation.</p>
<p>Varadkar’s visit comes amid shifting public sentiment among Biden’s
Democratic Party on the war in Gaza. On Thursday, Democratic Senate
Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the highest-ranking Jewish elected
official in the U.S. and an avid supporter of Israel, stunned Israelis
by condemning Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an “obstacle
to peace” and calling for new elections in Israel.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Biden and Varadkar also are set to discuss support for Ukraine’s push
against Russian aggression amid a deadlock in the U.S. Congress over
funding for Kyiv. The Irish leader is expected to add his voice to the
chorus of European leaders urging House Republicans to pass the aid
package.</p>
<p>Northern Ireland</p>
<p>First Minister of Northern Ireland, Michelle O’Neill of Sinn Fein and
Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly of the Democratic Unionist
Party, or DUP, are also in Washington to take part in St. Patrick
celebrations.  </p>
<p>The two aim to deliver the message that Northern Ireland is open for
business following the recently restored power-sharing deal in Stormont,
the Northern Ireland Assembly, after two years of political infighting
between DUP, which favors continued governance with London, and Sinn
Fein, which broadly supports reunification with Ireland. </p>
<p>Biden, who often cites his Irish heritage, has long advocated for the
Good Friday Agreement, the 1998 peace deal that helped end 30 years of
bloody conflict over whether Northern Ireland should unify with Ireland
or remain part of the United Kingdom. </p>
<p>In his visit to Northern Ireland last year, the president promised
that American businesses are ready to invest once power-sharing and
stability is returned.</p>

id="judge-da-must-step-aside-or-remove-special-prosecutor-in-trump-case">Judge:
DA Must Step Aside or Remove Special Prosecutor in Trump Case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ATLANTA, GEORGIA — Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis must
step aside from the Georgia election interference case against Donald
Trump or remove the special prosecutor with whom she had a romantic
relationship before the case can proceed, the judge overseeing it ruled
Friday. </p>
<p>Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee did not find that
Willis’ relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade amounted to a
conflict of interest that should disqualify her from the case. However,
he said, the allegations created an “appearance of impropriety” that
infected the prosecution team. </p>
<p>“As the case moves forward, reasonable members of the public could
easily be left to wonder whether the financial exchanges have continued
resulting in some form of benefit to the District Attorney, or even
whether the romantic relationship has resumed,” the judge wrote. </p>
<p>“Put differently, an outsider could reasonably think that the
District Attorney is not exercising her independent professional
judgment totally free of any compromising influences. As long as Wade
remains on the case, this unnecessary perception will persist.” </p>
<p>A spokesperson for Willis did not immediately respond to a text
message seeking comment on the judge’s ruling Friday. </p>
<p>Willis hired Wade to lead the team to investigate and ultimately
prosecute Trump and 18 others accused of participating in a wide-ranging
scheme to illegally try to overturn Trump’s narrow loss to Democrat Joe
Biden in Georgia in 2020. Willis and Wade testified at a hearing last
month that they had engaged in a romantic relationship, but they
rejected the idea that Willis improperly benefited from it, as lawyers
for Trump and some of his co-defendants alleged. </p>
<p>McAfee wrote that there was insufficient evidence that Willis had a
personal stake in the prosecution. But he condemned what he described as
a “tremendous” lapse in judgment and the “unprofessional manner of the
District Attorney’s testimony.” Even so, he said dismissal of the case
was not the appropriate remedy to “adequately dissipate the financial
cloud of impropriety and potential untruthfulness found here.” </p>
<p>McAfee found no showing that the due process rights of Trump and the
other defendants had been violated or that the issues involved
prejudiced them in any way. He also said the disqualification of a
constitutional officer, like a district attorney, is not necessary “when
a less drastic and sufficiently remedial option is available.” </p>
<p>The judge said he believes that “Georgia law does not permit the
finding of an actual conflict for simply making bad choices — even
repeatedly — and it is the trial court’s duty to confine itself to the
relevant issues and applicable law properly brought before it.” </p>
<p>An attorney for co-defendant Michael Roman asked McAfee to dismiss
the indictment and prevent Willis and Wade and their offices from
continuing to prosecute the case. The attorney, Ashleigh Merchant,
alleged that Willis paid Wade large sums for his work and then
improperly benefited from the prosecution of the case when Wade used his
earnings to pay for vacations for the two of them. </p>
<p>Willis had insisted that the relationship created no financial or
personal conflict of interest that justified removing her office from
the case. She and Wade both testified that their relationship began in
the spring of 2022 and ended in the summer of 2023. They both said that
Willis either paid for things herself or used cash to reimburse Wade for
travel expenses. </p>
<p>The sprawling indictment charges Trump and more than a dozen other
defendants with violating Georgia’s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, known as RICO. The case uses a statute normally
associated with mobsters to accuse the former president, lawyers and
other aides of a “criminal enterprise” to keep him in power after he
lost the 2020 election to Biden. </p>
<p>Trump, Republicans’ presumptive presidential nominee for 2024, has
denied doing anything wrong and pleaded not guilty. </p>
<p>Earlier this week, the judge dismissed some of the charges against
Trump. </p>
<p>The six challenged counts charged the defendants with soliciting
public officers to violate their oaths. One count stemmed from a phone
call Trump made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a
fellow Republican, on Jan. 2, 2021, in which Trump urged Raffensperger
to “find 11,780 votes” for him to win the election in the state. </p>
<p>Another of the dismissed counts accused Trump of soliciting
then-Georgia House of Representatives Speaker David Ralston to violate
his oath of office by calling a special session of the legislature to
unlawfully appoint presidential electors. </p>
<p>McAfee said the counts did not allege sufficient detail regarding the
nature of the violations.</p>

<li>Construction is complete on South Fork Wind farm</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>The first utility-scale offshore wind farm in the
United States is finally up and running. South Fork Wind’s 12th and
final turbine was installed last month, and the project is now
delivering power to the Long Island grid, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul
<a href="https://us.orsted.com/news-archive/2024/03/south-fork-wind-powers-up-new-era-for-american-clean-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a>
yesterday. At full capacity, the 130-megawatt farm can generate enough
power for about 70,000 homes. Construction on the project took about two
years to complete. “This is just the beginning of New York’s offshore
wind future,” Hochul said. The offshore wind sector has faced economic
setbacks in the last year, with major projects delayed or canceled due
to supply chain problems and rising costs. But there’s “every indication
that there’s developer confidence in the sector,” Theodore Paradise, an
attorney specializing in offshore wind at the law firm K&amp;L Gates,
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/wind/the-first-big-us-offshore-wind-farm-is-open-heres-whats-next" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a><em>
Canary Media</em>. Two more projects – Massachusetts’ Vineyard Wind farm
and Rhode Island’s Revolution Wind farm – are expected to be completed
in coming months. States in the Northeast are planning to solicit
proposals for new projects amounting to 6 gigawatts of offshore wind
capacity and are developing cheaper and more efficient regional
transmission infrastructure. “Overall, we see the industry is moving
forward,” Paradise told <em>Canary</em>.

<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>U.S. hybrid sales are booming</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Hybrid car sales in the U.S. grew five times faster
than those of fully-electric vehicles last month,
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-automakers-race-build-more-hybrids-ev-sales-slow-2024-03-15/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to Morgan Stanley</a>. The rise in hybrid demand is fueled by customers
who may be interested in making the leap to an electric vehicle but
still have reservations about things like price, design, and range.
Whatever the reason, though, car makers and suppliers are responding
accordingly: <em>Reuters</em>
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-automakers-race-build-more-hybrids-ev-sales-slow-2024-03-15/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>
that Ford plans to double the share of hybrid F-150s to 20% of its
sales. Toyota plans to increase its hybrid offerings and overall hybrid
sales. German supplier Schaeffler will invest $230 million in an Ohio
factory to increase production of hybrid components. Hybrid production
in the U.S. could rise to as much as 20% of total light-vehicle
production by 2025, compared with 14% for EVs. “The industry shift
toward hybrids challenges the Biden administration’s pro-EV climate
policies, and environmental groups that want automakers to phase out
CO2-emitting internal combustion engines as quickly as possible,”
<em>Reuters</em> said.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Heatmap poll: Biden’s climate policy remains popular</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
As President Biden prepares to run for re-election, one fact has eluded
much notice: His climate change policies are pretty popular. An
exclusive Heatmap poll of 1,000 Americans conducted by Benenson Strategy
Group late last year found that most respondents backed the core ideas
behind Biden’s climate policies. They expressed the most support of
ideas meant to beef up the country’s manufacturing economy and build
more renewable electricity. Some key takeaways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Nearly 90% of Americans support encouraging domestic manufacturing.
</li>
<li>
85% support using tax incentives to make homes more energy efficient.
</li>
<li>
81% support funding research into carbon dioxide removal.
</li>
<li>
80% support investing in public transit.
</li>
<li>
78% support implementing policies that address environmental injustices.
</li>
<li>
A majority support a carbon tax.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
“At first I doubted the veracity of these results,”
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/bidens-climate-agenda-is-actually-popular" target="_self">said
Heatmap</a><a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/bidens-climate-agenda-is-actually-popular" target="_self">’</a><a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/bidens-climate-agenda-is-actually-popular" target="_self">s
Robinson Meyer</a>. And he’s probably not alone. Most Americans
underestimate public support for pro-climate policies. But Heatmap’s
results largely match other polling. And that is despite the
overwhelming public disappointment in Biden, whose approval rating has
fallen to 37%, an all-time low of his presidency. “At first glance,”
Robinson wrote, “Biden’s climate policy might seem to pose a paradox:
It’s really popular (at least facially), but nobody has seemed to
notice. That may persist through the November election. But it will not
be able to last for too long after that.”
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>EU expected to back track on green agriculture policies
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>After months of disruptive protests by angry farmers,
the European Union looks poised to weaken its climate proposals aimed at
the agriculture sector, <em>Bloomberg</em>
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-14/eu-set-to-water-down-climate-rules-to-placate-angry-farmers?srnd=green" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.
The new rules, expected as early as today, would reportedly let farmers
off the hook for things like promoting biodiversity, preventing soil
erosion, improving soil health, and reducing reliance on chemical
pesticides. “Taken together, they would enable farmers to get EU
subsidies even if they don’t meet the most basic environmental
standards,” <em>Politico</em>
<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-takes-the-ax-to-green-farming-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a>.
Farmers have argued the bloc’s environmental policies are too burdensome
at a time when their own operational costs are on the rise and food
prices have fallen. Last week the European Environment Agency released a
<a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/newsroom/news/europe-is-not-prepared-for" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>
warning that the EU is unprepared for climate change, singling out
agriculture as a sector where urgent action is needed “if the Continent
is to avoid catastrophic floods, years-long droughts and scorching
heatwaves,” <em>Politico</em> said.

bacteria-infected mosquitoes in an effort to control the nation’s dengue
emergency. The mosquito-borne virus is on the rise in South America;
already more than a million Brazilians have been infected in 2024. While
it is often asymptomatic, in some cases the disease can cause extreme
joint pain, and more than 35,000 people die from infections each year.
Climate change is making the dengue crisis worse by raising temperatures
and increasing rainfall in some areas, expanding mosquitoes’ breeding
grounds.<br/> <br/> The new program in Brazil involves breeding
mosquitoes infected with a bacteria called Wolbachia. “Wild females that
mate with Wolbachia-infected males produce eggs that don’t hatch,”
<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/03/15/1089845/brazil-dengue-wolbachia-mosquitos/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20country's%20anti,to%20grow%20inside%20the%20insects." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a>
<em>MIT Technology Review</em>. “Wolbachia-infected females produce
offspring that are also infected. Over time, the bacteria spread
throughout the population.” As one official put it: “We’re essentially
vaccinating mosquitoes against giving humans disease.”

fully aware what a privileged position it is, especially since the mess
that is Brexit.
</p>
<p>
(I wasn’t personally affected because of my existing Swedish
citizenship, but the whole thing left me livid. I remain especially
angry on behalf of all the people too young to vote in 2016, who had the
right to live, love and work anywhere in the EU ripped away from them.)
</p>
<p>
Being a creative and nerdy child that loved both art and physics, I went
into engineering at university, despite not knowing which field I wanted
to go into. I wanted to make stuff, and I wanted good job prospects. I
chose to specialise in communications electronics presumably because I
liked gadgets and the internet, but it was unfortunately not a great
fit. I found it both difficult and boring - it was super difficult to
work hard for something that wasn’t interesting to me. I noped out once
I’d made bachelor’s level of the intended integrated masters course.
</p>
<p>
I duly went to work in comms electronics and later semiconductor testing
before I left that industry. I hated being asked what I did for a
living, because I wasn’t happy. Next, I tried teaching physics to
teenagers, and while that was never boring, it was instead incredibly
stressful, so I left that too.
</p>
<p>
I then spent a decade in a cosy time-lapse niche, where the jobs ranged
across everything from building hardware through PCB design to video
editing, which was great. I worked for two different small companies
that both specialised in long-term time-lapse films of construction
projects.
</p>
<p>
My major hobby over a lot of this time has been swing dancing, and would
still be if not for covid. Other hobbies have included crochet, tall
ship sailing, cycling and photography. I really miss the dancing, but
dislike the illness risk. I don’t want to repeatedly bring covid home to
the family (which I have already done twice, despite being very
vaccinated and relatively careful).
</p>
<p>
After the career-hopping, I ended up with a poor self image - that I
must be inherently lazy, or work-shy. Three-ish years ago, after two
1-year maternity leaves in fairly quick succession had left me feeling
directionless, I decided to <del>nope out</del> pivot again, this time
into web development. I’d loved tinkering with making websites as a
teenager, and it turned out I still do!
</p>
<p>
I used my limited spare time to retrain, trying to catch up to modern
web development* and attending therapy (having a new baby just as the
covid lockdowns began was rough, fam). After lots of ignored
applications and a few bombed interviews, I saw THE job I wanted. I
threw everything I could at it, and got a friend to coach me before the
interview.
</p>
<p>
She turned my self story of work shyness and noping-out into one of
knowing myself, what engages me and what won’t work for me, of having
the courage to try or learn new things. I cried buckets. And I got the
job.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been a front end web developer for coming up 18 months. I love it.
I’m very into accessibility, because the web is for everyone.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><em>seriously, trying to catch up the last 10 years of change was
and still is a wild ride!</em>
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What's the story behind your blog?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
As you can probably tell from the previous answer, I can just keep
typing on about myself and my experiences, so I do. I have had several
blogs in different places online for years - going back to 1999 when it
was just a ‘news’ page on a hand coded website.
</p>
<p>
I did lock it all down and remove most searchable traces of myself when
I went into teaching. I sort of regret that, but you really don’t want
the teenagers you teach finding out so much stuff about you!
</p>
<p>
For years, lots of my writing sank into long posts on Facebook. I have
friends who still do that - I wonder if they should also try blogging.
Many of my Facebook friends are so thoughtful, eloquent, and insightful,
which makes me wonder how much interesting and profound thought is
disappearing into these platforms.
</p>
<p>
My current blog sprang to life during my pivot to web development. I was
building up a homepage and portfolio for my new career-to-be at the
time, and naturally it needed a blog. I found a couple of ancient posts
from old blogs and Facebook posts to seed it with, and I’ve been adding
to it ever since.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to
blogging?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
It’s a bit all over the place, to be honest. Sometimes a thought just
hits me and the words keep coming, which definitely happens more with
emotive content.
</p>
<p>
Other times it stutters - I started a long post about how my website’s
sliding tabs gimmick is made and never finished it, but I published it
unfinished anyway. I figured there was nothing wrong with writing in
public. If anyone takes an interest in it, I’ll add more or maybe even
complete it.
</p>
<p>
Since adopting both very short notes (I call them Short Thorts because I
try a bit too hard to be original) and week notes (a.k.a. Weak Notes.
Yeah..), the pressure to only write big, long, good blog posts has
lifted a bit. Sometimes I just bash out one of those instead, when I
want to output something brief that’s not only posted to Mastodon.
</p>
<p>
So many times I’ve thought “ooh, I could blog about that,” and then
poof, it’s gone. I should make a note of those ideas. Maybe even within
their own blog post… hm.
</p>
<p>
I tend towards chatty verbosity so the drafts are often written big, and
then chopped down. I’ve had to do that for these question responses too,
not that you can tell!
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe
the physical space influences your creativity?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I often start drafting blog posts on my phone, as I don’t really want to
be tethered to the laptop or desk. Sometimes the best stuff comes when I
have a spare moment between other things.
</p>
<p>
I do really like my computer setup and the sunny attic room I use as a
home office, but I already spend enough time in there while working the
day job.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your
tech stack?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
My domain is registered with PorkBun, and the website is hosted on
Netlify. I have considered other hosts, but I’m using a fair few of
Netlify’s handy features, like deploying from GitHub, Forms (to take
contact emails and handle the Guestbook posts), and rewrites.
</p>
<p>
I build the site with Astro, because it takes care of the blog’s
markdown files, and allows me to use vanilla HTML, CSS and JS to build a
static site, while also being able to use layouts and components and JS
variables in my markup.
</p>
<p>
I keep considering whether to build a CMS into it, but when I do a big
post I draft it wherever (sometimes in a draft email to nobody) and like
to finish it up in VS Code. For the short thorts I find
<a href="https://prose.io/">prose.io</a> to be really useful, which I
mostly use via my phone.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would
you do anything differently?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Because this blog has been through a few iterations already, and was
originally on a different domain - no, I don’t think so. I take so much
joy in building the site itself - the blogging is actually secondary to
that.
</p>
<p>
If however I was only into the writing, I would definitely pick
something simpler with a nice CMS that I could comfortably use on my
phone.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how
much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it
generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising
personal blogs?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
The domain costs about ten dollars a year. Currently everything else is
free - that might change if I change hosts - I don’t mind paying a
little for a good service. The site doesn’t generate any revenue.
</p>
<p>
Indirectly I suppose it’s a networking aid, and building your network
can eventually bring more income, maybe?
</p>
<p>
As for people monetising, why not if you can earn a bit of cash? I’d
prefer people managed to do that in non-invasive ways, i.e. without a
paywall, obnoxious modals, or tracking - or at least let me opt out of
the tracking.
</p>
<p>
The mommy bloggers of the 00’s suffered such a big backlash after
starting to monetise - I’d hope we’re cooler with it now.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth
checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing
next?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I have a brr, a Heydon and two Henries to recommend:
</p>
<p>
I don’t know what brr’s name is, probably because they chose not to
share it. But brr.fyi is wonderful. It’s recently fallen dormant, as
they’re no longer in Antarctica, but the blog remains extremely
interesting.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://brr.fyi/">brr.fyi</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Heydon Pickering writes and makes videos. His style is wry, pithy, and
in the videos somewhat unhinged!
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://heydonworks.com/">heydonworks.com</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://briefs.video/">briefs.video</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Henry Desroches has such style with his words and in his sites - here
are three, all wonderful in different ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://henry.codes/">henry.codes</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://stillness.digital/">stillness.digital</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://strange.website/">strange.website</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The second Henry is my husband. He’s blogged on and off for years, the
archive is now pretty impressive! I’m biased, of course. He thinks
deeply about a lot of things, and sometimes shares those thoughts.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.henryleach.com/">henryleach.com</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You interviewing any of those four would be very interesting for me!
</p>
<p>
For more recommendations of cool stuff, there’s my blogroll:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://sarajoy.dev/blog/roll/">sarajoy.dev/blog/roll/</a>
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with
us?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I sometimes I find words worth sharing in the books I read to my
children. I think this might have been from The Worrysaurus:<br /> “If
it’s not a happy ending, then it hasn’t ended yet.”
</p>
<p>
From me: Don’t be afraid to pivot. If you can afford it, plus the time
and the effort, do it. Share your experiences, we’re here to read about
them and support you :)
</p>
<p>
Finally, and rather less suitable for children, I’d like to
<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/just-walk-out-you-can-leave-running-skeleton">quote
dasharez0ne</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
JUST WALK OUT<br /> you can leave!!!<br /> IF IT SUCKS… HIT DA
BRICKS!!<br /> real winners quit
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Oh and your readers should feel free to come find me on Mastodon:

2024-03-15 A linkblog for IRC and Discord channels
</h1>
<p>
A while ago I wrote a bot called
<a href="2022-06-20_Discord_Bot">Norn</a> that optionally connects to an
IRC server and one or more Discord “servers”. It keeps notes for events,
for specific dates and for date ranges. It remembers answers to
questions or prompts. Yesterday I added the ability to remember links.
The links are exported to HTML and RSS files for all to see, so it
serves as a way to keep up for those who are not as strongly invested
into those online communities.
</p>
<p>
In all these these cases, the bot treats all the channels that have the
same name as “the same”. This can get weird. My hope, of course, is that
this is cool. We’ll see.
</p>
<p>
The first two links are specific for my use of Norn:

<h2 id="where-did-all-of-d.c.s-federal-workers-go">Where did all of
D.C.’s federal workers go?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-15, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
The campaign to shrink the federal government is working — in
Washington, D.C., at least. Data released by the Labor Department shows
that D.C. ranked dead last when it comes to growth in federal government
jobs last year. Most federal workers have always been based outside the
nation’s capital, but the pandemic turbocharged that, hitting the city’s
bottom line. Plus, why is it getting more expensive to do your taxes?

<p>date: 2024-03-15, updated: 2024-03-14, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
C++ guru Herb Sutter
<a href="https://herbsutter.com/2024/03/11/safety-in-context/">writes</a>
about how we can improve the programming language for better security.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The immediate problem “is” that it’s Too Easy By Default™ to write
security and safety vulnerabilities in C++ that would have been caught
by stricter enforcement of known rules for <i>type, bounds,
initialization</i>, and <i>lifetime</i> language safety.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
His conclusion:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We need to improve software security and software safety across the
industry, especially by improving programming language safety in C and
C++, and in C++ a 98% improvement in the four most common problem areas
is achievable in the medium term. But if we focus on programming
language safety alone, we may find ourselves fighting yesterday’s war
and missing larger past and future security dangers that affect software
written in any language…

<h2 id="carbon-removal-is-getting-gamified">Carbon Removal Is Getting
Gamified</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-15, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTc0MjI1Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNjYwNjgxN30.UgI-WObev-74Rh3qA-TyV0jZXWxX78Apf4JHB_nFOCM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
The Department of Energy wants YOU to purchase carbon removal. Well,
maybe not you, personally, but your city, state, or employer. And as an
incentive, it’s turning the buying process into the equivalent of an
arcade game, inviting companies to try to make it to the top of a new
carbon removal buyers leaderboard.
</p>
<p>
The agency soft-launched the concept on Thursday under the banner of the
“Voluntary Carbon Dioxide Removal Purchase Challenge.” There’s no prize
money associated with the challenge — it’s not even clear whether there
will be any winners. The goal is to encourage companies to make “bigger
and bolder” public commitments to purchase carbon removal. At least one
company, Google, has already
<a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/pledge-to-support-carbon-removal-solutions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said
it would commit $35 million</a> this year.
</p>
<p>
As the world has delayed climate action, developing the capacity to
remove carbon from the atmosphere has become an imperative. Scientists
now suggest it is
“<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3df3f408-57a0-4718-b8d6-f8629118b7eb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unavoidable</a>”
if we want to limit warming to internationally agreed-upon levels.
Carbon removal offers both a way to cancel out emissions from activities
like flying and growing food that could take decades to figure out how
to eliminate, and an antidote for some of the legacy carbon that’s
already been emitted.
</p>
<p>
But today, existing carbon removal methods and technologies are too
small-scale and expensive to make a meaningful difference. Many also
lack adequate techniques to measure and verify how effective they are.
That’s why last year the Department of Energy announced that it would
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/fecm/carbon-dioxide-removal-purchase-pilot-prize" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spend
$35 million</a> to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/carbon-removal-us-government" target="_self">purchase
carbon removal</a> from promising companies. The initial winners are
expected to be announced later this year.
</p>
<p>
With that program, the DOE was following in the footsteps of companies
like Stripe and Microsoft, both of which have put significant resources
toward
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-4-enhanced-rock-weathering" target="_self">vetting
carbon removal startups</a> and making early purchases of credits to
help get the industry off the ground. With this new challenge, the
agency said it aims to address non-financial barriers that are
preventing companies from buying carbon removal as part of their climate
strategies, such as a lack of transparency and a “lack of recognition
that carbon removal credit purchases are essential and valuable today.”
</p>
<p>
To join the challenge, a company or organization will be required to
purchase carbon removal credits “annually” and disclose the details to
the DOE. The agency will build a public inventory of carbon removal
credit buyers, suppliers, projects, standards and methodologies used,
and volume of carbon removal delivered.
</p>
<p>
Companies have no apparent incentive to participate other than to see
their names on the list, and possibly try and get to the top. In the
words of DOE, it offers a “a unique opportunity to enter the carbon
removal market with a splash!” (Exclamation point added by me.)
</p>
<p>
There is already a voluntary leaderboard tracking carbon removal
purchases and deliveries called
<a href="https://www.cdr.fyi/leaderboards" target="_blank">CDR.FYI</a>.
But not just anyone will be able to get on the DOE’s list. To qualify,
the purchases must also be “aligned with the requirements and assessment
criteria of DOE’s purchases.” The agency also said it would evaluate
additional carbon removal projects beyond those it has assessed for its
purchase pilot, and publish a list of available credits that have
garnered a government stamp of approval.
</p>
<p>
Sasha Stashwick, the policy director at Carbon180, a carbon removal
advocacy nonprofit, told me this is a promising step to building a
carbon removal market that doesn’t suffer from the integrity issues that
have plagued the voluntary carbon offsets markets.
</p>
<p>
“I think one of the key non market barriers is, how do you even define
what is a reputable ton of carbon removal? Alleviating that burden is
potentially huge,” she said. “The federal government is basically
saying, we’ll de-risk these projects for you. We’ll determine what is a
good project, and you can buy alongside us.”
</p>
<p>
The rules are preliminary, and the agency is
<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/03/14/2024-05269/notice-of-intent-regarding-launching-a-voluntary-carbon-dioxide-removal-purchasing-challenge-doe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accepting
comments</a> on the program until May 15. It expects to launch the
challenge later this year.

<p>date: 2024-03-15, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog</p>
<p>This morning, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), one of the
highest-ranking Jewish officials in the U.S. government, said Israelis
need to call new elections to replace Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
who, Schumer said, “has lost his way by allowing his political survival
to take precedence over the best interests of Israel.” Schumer, who is a
strong ally of Israel and who also blamed Hamas for the crisis in the
Middle East, warned that the deadly toll on civilians in Gaza under the
policies of Netanyahu’s government is “pushing support for Israel
worldwide to historic lows. Israel cannot survive if it becomes a
pariah.”</p>

Police Confirm 2 Dead in Fierce Storm that Damaged Homes, Businesses in
Ohio and Kentucky</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WINCHESTER, Ind. — Police in Ohio confirmed two deaths resulting from
a fierce storm system that unleashed suspected twisters and damaged
homes and businesses in parts of Ohio and Kentucky on Thursday.</p>
<p>Chief Deputy Joe Kopus of the Logan County Sheriff’s Department in
Logan County in Bellefontaine, Ohio, confirmed the fatalities in an
email early Friday to The Associated Press. He said there likely would
be more fatalities discovered, noting there was heavy damage in
Lakeview, Midway, Orchard Island and Russel’s Point.</p>
<p>The Indiana State Police said there are “many significant injuries”
after a tornado tore through the community of Winchester.</p>
<p>“There have been many, many significant injuries, but I don’t know
the number. I don’t know where they are. I don’t know what those
injuries are,” Indiana State Police Superintendent Douglas Carter told
reporters just before midnight Thursday. “There’s a lot that we don’t
know yet.”</p>
<p>Earlier in the night state police said they were investigating
reports of deaths but at the news conference Carter said there were “no
known fatalities.”</p>
<p>State officials called on Indiana Task Force One to help with search
efforts in Winchester, a town of 4,700 people located nearly 70 miles
(112 kilometers) northeast of Indianapolis, according to a post by the
rescue team on X. The team is one of 28 Department of Homeland Security
and Federal Emergency Management Agency-sponsored Urban Search and
Rescue teams in the United States.</p>
<p>“I’m shaken; it’s overwhelming,” Winchester Mayor Bob McCoy said. “I
heard what sounded like a train and then I started hearing sirens.”</p>
<p>He and his wife were hunkered in a closet during the twister, which
hit about 8 p.m.</p>
<p>“I’ve never heard that sound before; I don’t want to hear it again,”
McCoy said.</p>
<p>The suspected tornado damaged a Walmart store and a Taco Bell in
Winchester, Randolph County Sheriff Art Moystner told FOX59/CBS4. Travel
throughout the county is restricted to emergency management workers
only, he said.</p>
<p>At about the same time as the tornado hit Winchester, another
suspected twister touched down about 75 miles (120 miles) to the east in
Ohio. The tornado hit near the southern end of Indian Lake, impacting
the villages of Lakeview and Russells Point, said Sheri Timmers, a
spokesperson for Logan County, home to the villages.</p>
<p>“As far as we know, we have lots of injuries. We don’t know the
extent of the injuries,” Timmers said. “An RV park was impacted.”</p>
<p>Multiple buildings in the Indian Lake area were damaged, Timmers
said, but the full extent of the destruction was still being
assessed. </p>
<p>Whether anyone was missing in the aftermath, was not immediately
known.</p>
<p>“They’re right now doing some searching,” she said.</p>
<p>Amber Fagan, president and chief executive of the Indian Lake Area
Chamber of Commerce, called the village of Lakeview “completely
demolished,” saying homes, campgrounds and a laundromat were hard-hit by
the tornado.</p>
<p>“There’s places burning,” she said. “There’s power lines through
people’s windows.”</p>
<p>A shelter has been opened for anyone displaced.</p>
<p>In Ohio’s Huron County, emergency management officials posted on
Facebook that there was a “confirmed large and extremely dangerous
tornado” near Plymouth – some 75 miles (120 kilometers) northeast of
Indian Lake.</p>
<p>To the west of Winchester, Indiana, in Delaware County, emergency
management officials said initial assessments suggested that up to half
of the structures in the small town of Selma were damaged by a possible
tornado.</p>
<p>“We are relieved to report that only minor injuries have been
reported thus far, with one individual transported to the hospital for
treatment,” the Delaware County Emergency Management Agency said in a
news release. About 750 people live in Selma.</p>
<p>Earlier, storms damaged homes and trailers in the Ohio River
communities of Hanover and Lamb in Indiana.</p>
<p>The Ohio governor’s office said they did not have any information
about fatalities in the state.</p>
<p>Jefferson County Sheriff Ben Flint said storms destroyed three or
four single-family homes and four or five other structures and
demolished several uninhabited campers along the river.</p>
<p>“We were fortunate that no one was injured,” Flint told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Sgt. Stephen Wheeles of the Indiana State Police earlier said another
suspected tornado struck Jefferson County, damaging several homes and
downing trees and power lines.</p>
<p>He posted photos on X showing one home with its roof torn off and
another missing roof shingles as well as an image of a baseball-sized
hailstone.</p>
<p>Around 2,000 Duke Energy customers in Hanover lost power at one point
during the storms, the company reported.</p>
<p>In Kentucky, Trimble County Emergency Management Director Andrew
Stark said the storms damaged at least 50 structures, including
homes.</p>
<p>“We have a whole bunch of damage,” Stark told the Courier Journal of
Louisville.</p>
<p>Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear issued a statement saying a tornado
touched down along the Indiana state border in Gallatin and Trimble
counties and there were reports of a couple of minor injuries. He urged
Kentuckians to stay aware of the weather as more storms were expected
across the state Thursday evening and overnight.</p>
<p>“It does appear that there is some really significant damage,
especially to the town of Milton in Trimble County,” Beshear said. “We
think there are over 100 structures that are potentially damaged.”</p>
<p>The state’s emergency operations center was activated to coordinate
storm response, Beshear said.</p>
<p>Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb posted on Facebook Thursday night that the
Indiana Department of Homeland Security is monitoring the current
weather situation.</p>
<p>“Severe weather has impacted Hoosiers all across the state, and we
have emergency response personnel in the impacted areas,” he wrote.</p>
<p>The Indiana Department of Homeland Security posted on Facebook that
their staff are on scene in Randolph County, home to Winchester, working
with locals and that the State Emergency Operations Center has been
activated to an enhanced staffing level to respond to the storm.</p>
<p>A Facebook post on the Winchester Community High School page said all
the schools in that school district would be closed on Friday. Another
post said the high school had electricity and was open for emergency use
for people who “need somewhere warm and dry.”</p>
<p>Large pieces of hail also was reported in parts of the St. Louis area
Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>There were unconfirmed reports of tornadoes in Jefferson County,
Missouri, and Monroe County, Illinois, but no immediate reports of
damage.</p>
<p>Severe weather was possible into Thursday night from northeast Texas
to Indiana and Ohio, the National Weather Service said on X.</p>

Crossref</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-15, from: Crossref Blog</p>

<span>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2024/credential-checking.png" width="75%"/>
</figure>
<p></span></p>
</div>
It turns out that one of the things that is really difficult at Crossref
is checking whether a set of Crossref credentials has permission to act
on a specific DOI prefix. This is the result of many legacy systems
storing various mappings in various different software components, from
our Content System through to our CRM.
<p>
To this end, I wrote a basic application,
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/credcheck" target="_blank">credcheck</a>,
that will allow you to test a Crossref credential against an API.
</p>
<p>
There are two modes of usage. First, a command-line interface that
allows you to run a basic command and get feedback:
</p>
<p>
          Usage: cli.py [OPTIONS] USERNAME PASSWORD DOI
</p>
<p>
Second, you can use it as a programmatic library in Python:
</p>
<p>
          import cred<br>           credential =
cred.Credential(username=username, password=password, doi=doi)
</p>
<p>
          if not credential.is_authenticated():<br>           …
</p>
<p>
          if credential.is_authorised():<br>           …
</p>
<p>
The tool splits down authentication (whether the given username and
password are valid) and authorisation (whether the valid credentials are
usable against a specific DOI/prefix).
</p>
<p>
For technical information, the way this works is by attempting to run a
report on the specific DOI in question and then scraping the response
page. We hope, at some future point, that there will be a real API for
this, but for now this solves the problem as a bridge.

<h2 id="cloudnativepg-1.22.2-and-1.21.4-released">CloudNativePG 1.22.2
and 1.21.4 Released!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-15, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
The <strong>CloudNativePG Community</strong> is thrilled to unveil the
latest update for the <strong>CloudNativePG Operator</strong>, now
available for the supported versions 1.22 and 1.21.
</p>
<p>
Key enhancements in both supported minor releases are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
flexibility to configure the <code>wal_level</code> GUC in PostgreSQL
and disable WAL archiving via an annotation, granting you finer control
over your PostgreSQL environment
</li>
<li>
configurable duration of TLS certificates managed by the operator
</li>
<li>
introduction of the <code>publication</code> and
<code>subscription</code> command groups in the <code>cnpg</code> plugin
for <code>kubectl</code>, facilitating seamless management of PostgreSQL
native logical replication. This unlocks new possibilities for
imperative major online upgrades and online imports, enriching your data
management strategies.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Versions 1.22.2 and 1.21.4</strong> are <em>patch releases</em>
that include essential bug fixes, addressing issues such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
proper synchronization of PVC group labels to match those on the pods
</li>
<li>
check that volume snapshots are ready before initiating recovery
procedures, ensuring smoother operations and data integrity
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In adherence to Kubernetes best practices, we are transitioning from
client-side to server-side application of manifests starting from this
release. As a result, the <code>–server-side</code> option is now the
preferred choice when installing the operator.
</p>
<p>
We highly recommend updating the operator at your earliest convenience
to leverage these enhancements and bug fixes, ensuring a seamless and
efficient PostgreSQL experience.
</p>
<p>
Please refer to the following release notes for comprehensive insights
into each version:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.22/release_notes/v1.22/">release

<li>
<a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.21/release_notes/v1.21/">release
notes for 1.21.4</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We extend our gratitude for your continued support, and we are excited
to witness your enhanced experience with the updated CloudNativePG
Operator. Thank You.

<h2 id="bidens-climate-agenda-is-actually-popular">Biden’s Climate
Agenda Is Actually Popular</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-14, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTA5OTU3My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxNDk5ODM5M30.8JuthdR-tIFmA2N9NGM7tHzduLnU3ierm2_lQI0cbUY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
As President Joe Biden prepares to run for re-election, one fact has
eluded much notice: His climate change policies are pretty popular.
</p>
<p>
In an exclusive Heatmap poll of 1,000 Americans conducted by Benenson
Strategy Group late last year, most respondents backed the core ideas
behind Biden’s climate policies. They expressed the most support of
ideas meant to beef up the country’s manufacturing economy and build
more renewable electricity.
</p>
<p>
Nearly 90% of Americans, for instance, support encouraging domestic
manufacturing. They also support using tax incentives to make homes more
energy efficient (85%), funding research into carbon dioxide removal
(81%), investing in public transit (80%), and implementing policies that
address environmental injustices (78%).
</p>
<p>
That is despite the overwhelming public disappointment in Biden. Biden’s
approval rating
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-BIDEN/POLL/nmopagnqapa/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has
fallen to 37%</a>, an all-time low of his presidency, despite his
boisterous State of the Union performance. At first glance, Biden’s
climate policy might seem to pose a paradox: It’s really popular (at
least facially), but nobody has seemed to notice. That may persist
through the November election. But it will not be able to last for too
long after that.
</p>
<p>
The least popular policies are those that Biden has pursued only when he
has bipartisan support — or that he has not pursued at all. Making it
easier to build new fossil fuel pipelines, for instance, is supported by
62% of Americans, less than almost any other policy aimed at increasing
the country’s energy supply. A slight majority of Americans support
making it easier to build new nuclear power plants.
</p>
<h3>
The public generally supports climate policy
</h3>
<p>
At first I doubted the veracity of these results — some of Biden’s
policies are, after all, putting up autocrat-like ratings. A carbon tax
is polling 52 points above water.
</p>
<p>
But these results largely match other polling. Surveys reliably find
that about two-thirds of Americans would support some kind of carbon
tax. Last year, for instance, 68%of Americans backed “requiring fossil
fuel companies to pay a carbon tax,” according to
<a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
Yale poll</a>. These numbers have been remarkably stable over time. As
much as 67% of Americans backed a carbon tax in 2019, according to
<a href="https://epic.uchicago.edu/insights/voter-support-for-carbon-tax-may-depend-on-how-revenue-is-used/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
poll</a> from the University of Chicago and the Associated Press-NORC
Center on Public Affairs Research.
</p>
<p>
If these numbers surprise you, you’re not alone. Most Americans
<a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2023/06/most-americans-underestimate-the-popularity-of-policies-to-protect-the-climate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">underestimate</a>
public support for pro-climate policies. (Or at least, they
underestimate what <em>polling</em> finds about Americans’ support for
climate policies.)
</p>
<p>
The rub is that public support descends to more Earthly levels once you
start asking about concrete costs. Those who say they support a carbon
tax when told it will be imposed on fossil fuel companies, for instance,
may change their minds after fossil fuel companies pass that tax along
as higher prices. Another University of Chicago poll
<a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/is-the-public-willing-to-pay-to-help-fix-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a>
that most Americans were okay paying a monthly fee of $1 to fight
climate change. When asked if they’d pay $40 a month, support fell to
23%.
</p>
<h3>
Climate policy is hard to pass
</h3>
<p>
One of the more ironic aspects of Biden’s success is how rapidly
commentators have forgotten that climate change policy used to be seen
as uniquely difficult to legislate in the United States. In 1993, and
then again in 2010, the House of Representatives passed bills that would
have helped fight climate change. Each time, the Senate blocked the
legislation. The Senate also effectively blocked the adoption of the
Kyoto Protocol, the first international climate treaty, in the 1990s.
</p>
<p>
Through the decades, Congress passed energy bills meant to expand the
energy supply in an all-of-the-above way and changed the tax code to let
people and companies save money by building solar or wind energy. But
these policies expired every few years, and they failed to amount to a
unified climate strategy.
</p>
<p>
Other countries with other forms of government — China, the United
Kingdom, the European Union member states — didn’t have this problem.
(Which doesn’t mean that they’ve been perfect on climate change.)
America’s failure to pass climate policy became a singular indictment of
its bicameral system.
</p>
<p>
Why was it so hard to pass climate policy? The short answer is that for
years, climate advocates focused on one particular policy —
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/carbon-tax-2025" target="_self">carbon
pricing</a> — as a cure-all solution to climate change. And while carbon
pricing is backed up by economic theory, environmentalists and
economists struggled to generate the kind of durable, veto-proof support
that legislation needs to pass in today’s environment.
</p>
<p>
By design, carbon pricing raises the cost of energy — meaning that
opponents can paint it as a measure meant to increase the cost of
living. That didn’t work for voters in the persistently sluggish economy
of the 2010s, and it split Democrats’ coalition — of college-educated
liberals and lower-income workers — in half. (It also struggled to deal
with the political mise en scene. Washington’s interest in climate
policy has usually peaked during moments of <em>high </em>energy prices,
but the past decade’s fracking boom kept a lid on oil and natural gas
prices.)
</p>
<p>
But climate advocates also struggled for years against more
political-economic obstacles. As the political scientist Matto
Mildenberger
<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262538251/carbon-captured/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">documented</a>,
climate proposals have historically invited pro-business groups and
labor unions to team up and fight a common enemy. Because climate policy
targeted entire industries at once — and because these industries were,
naturally, especially sensitive to wholesale energy prices —
environmentalists had to take on labor <em>and</em> management at the
same time.
</p>
<p>
It didn’t help that many of the industries concerned had a special claim
to Democrats’ sensibilities. Until recently, many of the sectors most
affected by climate policy were unionized at a higher rate than the
average. Even today, more than 20% of utility workers belong to a union,
for example, as compared to 6% of workers in the private sector. These
rates were even higher in the recent past. About 16% of automaking
workers
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/11/20/uaw-contract-ford-general-motors-stellantis/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">are
represented by unions</a> today, but union membership stood at 60%
within living memory. Even in 2010, about one in 10 American workers in
the mining, quarrying, and fossil-fuel extraction industries were
represented by a union, which was also above the national rate at the
time.
</p>
<p>
Democrats dealt with these problems by abandoning most broad-scale
attempts to tax fossil fuels. During the Trump administration,
progressives chose to focus instead on using industrial policy and
regulations to rein in carbon-intensive sectors — instead of raising the
cost of fossil fuels, perhaps a climate law could lower the cost of
clean alternatives. And instead of raising energy prices — thereby
annoying voters and discouraging high-profile industries — perhaps
policy could lower them. Hence the Inflation Reduction Act.
</p>
<p>
This approach succeeded! And yet many of the IRA’s policies have
struggled to attract public attention. Even though the IRA is Biden’s
signature legislative achievement — comparable to President Barack
Obama’s Affordable Care Act — Biden has largely avoided the specific
backlash that greeted that law. Obamacare was
<a href="https://www.kff.org/interactive/kff-health-tracking-poll-the-publics-views-on-the-aca/#?response=Favorable--Unfavorable&aRange=all" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about
10 points underwater</a> in 2010, even as Obama himself was about as
popular as he was unpopular. Biden, by contrast, is incredibly disliked
—
<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he
is now 17 points underwater</a>, a nadir for his presidency — yet the
IRA’s core ideas remain well-liked.
</p>
<p>
That is politically inconvenient for Biden and it raises difficult
long-term questions for progressives. Biden and Democrats have seemingly
given voters what they want — and it’s not clear that the voters care.
</p>
<h3>
This is a long-term policy problem for Donald Trump
</h3>
<p>
But for the would-be Grover Cleveland to Biden’s Benjamin Harrison, it
might be <em>more </em>of a problem. If elected, Trump has promised to
repeal parts of the Inflation Reduction Act. His
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change" target="_self">rhetoric
on climate change</a> hasn’t really changed since the 2016 election,
when he argued that it was “job-killing.” Meanwhile, he hates electric
vehicles, claiming that “they don’t go far, they cost too much, and
they’re all going to be made in China.”
</p>
<p>
Yet it’s the electric vehicles made in America that are going to get
him. If Trump repeals the IRA’s subsidies, then domestic manufacturing
will suffer. The EV industry
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ev-battery-manufacturing-energizes-southern-communities-battery-belt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has
created</a> roughly 70,000 jobs over the past three years, and many of
those roles are in electorally decisive states, including Georgia and
Michigan. Trump has promised to act as a “Day One dictator,” but even
then, he will still be at least partly constrained by the desires and
interests of the local and state-level Republicans who support him — and
<em>they </em>will need those jobs and investment to continue.
</p>
<p>
Of course, there’s no guarantee that these policies will produce
political support. In Texas, an explosion of renewable construction has
led not to surging public support for clean energy, but to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/renewable-energy-texas-senate-voting" target="_self">a
state-led “war” on wind and solar</a>. (That said, renewables don’t
generate local jobs and economic activity in the same long-term way that
factories do.) Yet these policies don’t ever have to be <em>popular
</em>to be <em>durable </em>— in part because voters won’t organize
around them until they’re threatened. Biden’s climate policies — no
matter how popular — will probably never win him reelection. But they
could very well protect his legacy long after he’s gone.

id="husband-of-american-journalist-jailed-in-russia-brings-campaign-to-washington">Husband
of American Journalist Jailed in Russia Brings Campaign to
Washington</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The husband and two daughters of an American journalist
jailed in Russia are in Washington this week to call on the U.S.
government to do more to help secure the reporter’s release. </p>
<p>Alsu Kurmasheva, a dual U.S.-Russian national, has been jailed in
Russia since October 2023 on charges of failing to register as a
so-called foreign agent and spreading what Moscow views as false
information about the Russian army. </p>
<p>Kurmasheva is a Prague-based editor at the Tatar-Bashkir service of
VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, or RFE/RL. The
journalist and her employer reject the charges, which carry a combined
maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.</p>
<p>Since Kurmasheva’s jailing, her husband, Pavel Butorin, has
consistently called for her immediate release. He and their daughters
traveled from Prague to Washington this week as part of the campaign to
secure Kurmasheva’s release.  </p>
<p>“I’m here because I think that the U.S. government can and should do
more for her release,” Butorin told VOA.  </p>
<p>Butorin is the director of Current Time TV, a Russian-language TV and
digital network led by RFE/RL in partnership with VOA.</p>
<p>While in Washington, Butorin met with State Department officials, but
he did not specify to VOA what was discussed during those
meetings.  </p>
<p>“We are making — I will say, cautiously — some progress toward the
designation of Alsu as a wrongfully detained American journalist,”
Butorin said. “I appreciate the support and attention that Alsu’s case
has been given by the administration.” </p>
<p>For months, Butorin, RFE/RL and international press freedom groups
have called on the State Department to declare Kurmasheva wrongfully
detained, which would open up additional resources to help secure her
release.  </p>
<p>Russia’s embassy in Washington did not immediately reply to a VOA
email requesting comment.  </p>
<p>Kurmasheva is one of two American journalists jailed in Russia.  </p>
<p>The other — The Wall Street Journal’s Evan Gershkovich — has been
jailed in Russia since March 2023 on espionage charges that he, his
employer and the U.S. government deny. The 32-year-old is set to mark
one year behind bars on March 29.</p>
<p>The State Department has declared Gershkovich wrongfully
detained. </p>
<p>A State Department spokesperson said U.S. officials have pressed the
Russian government for access to Kurmasheva, but those requests have not
yet been granted.</p>
<p>“We are deeply concerned about Alsu Kurmasheva’s detention,” the
spokesperson told VOA in a statement.  </p>
<p>“The Department of State continuously reviews the circumstances
surrounding the detentions of U.S. nationals overseas, including those
in Russia, for indicators that they are wrongful,” the spokesperson said
regarding a potential wrongful detention determination. </p>
<p>“I’ve been, again, assured that Alsu’s case is a priority. I’ve heard
U.S. officials say that they do think that she is a political prisoner,
and they’re working hard on her release,” Butorin said.  </p>
<p>Butorin added that the most just resolution would be for Moscow to
drop the charges against his wife, who initially traveled to Russia in
May 2023 for a family emergency. Her passports were confiscated when she
tried to leave the country in June, and she was waiting for them to be
returned when she was detained in October.  </p>
<p>“The charges are absurd — spurious. She’s not a criminal. We know her
as a devoted mother to her daughters,” Butorin said. He added that the
situation has taken a toll on their two children. </p>
<p>“My daughters have had to grow up very quickly over these past nine
months. It’s been an incredibly stressful situation for our family,” he
said. “They want their mother back.”</p>

Say They’re Open to Delay in Trump Hush Money Trial</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — New York prosecutors said Thursday that they were open to
delaying the start of Donald Trump’s New York hush money criminal trial
by up to a month to give the former president’s lawyers time to review
evidence that was only recently turned over. </p>
<p>The Manhattan district attorney’s office said in a court filing that
it was not opposed to pushing the start of the trial back for up to 30
days. Jury selection in the trial is scheduled to begin March 25. </p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers are seeking a 90-day delay or the dismissal of
charges against Trump, alleging violations of what’s known as the
discovery process, where the sides exchange evidence. The new records
came from the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan, which previously
investigated the hush money arrangement at the heart of Trump’s New York
criminal case. </p>
<p>The defense has also sought to delay the trial until after the
Supreme Court rules on Trump’s presidential immunity claims, which his
lawyers say could apply to some of the allegations and evidence in the
hush money case. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments
April 25. </p>
<p>The judge in the hush money case, Juan Manuel Merchan, has yet to
rule on either request. </p>
<p>Since March 4, Trump’s lawyers have received at least 84,000 pages of
records from the federal prosecutor’s office in Manhattan, including a
batch of 31,000 pages on Wednesday, according to a court filing. </p>
<p>The records pertain to a federal investigation that touched on the
hush money matter and led to prison time for former Trump lawyer Michael
Cohen. </p>
<p>Federal prosecutors in 2018 charged Cohen with campaign finance
violations related to the hush money payments, with evading taxes
related to his investments in the taxi industry and with lying to
Congress. </p>
<p>Cohen, who blamed Trump for his legal problems, pleaded guilty and
served about a year in prison before being released to home confinement
because of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
<p>He is now a key prosecution witness in the Manhattan district
attorney’s case. Trump and his lawyers have portrayed Cohen as
completely untrustworthy.</p>

id="blinken-to-visit-philippines-to-reinforce-alliance-amid-south-china-sea-tensions">Blinken
to Visit Philippines to Reinforce Alliance Amid South China Sea
Tensions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken heads
to the Philippines next week, following a recent trade mission there by
U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. The visit comes amid escalating
tensions between the Philippines and China over maritime disputes in the
South China Sea. </p>
<p>“Secretary Blinken will travel to Manila to reaffirm our unwavering
commitment to our Philippine allies” and “promote peace and stability in
the South China Sea,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said
during a Thursday briefing. </p>
<p>Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has announced his meeting
with Blinken on March 19, with a focus on issues of cooperation and
security.</p>
<p>“The secretary’s visit will also underscore the importance of our
strong bilateral ties, which for 75 years, have been critical to
advancing our shared vision for a free and open connected, prosperous,
secure and resilient Indo-Pacific region,” Miller said. </p>
<p>During Commerce Secretary Raimondo’s trade and investment mission to
Manila this week, she announced plans to invest more than $1 billion in
the Philippines’ tech sector and help double the number of semiconductor
factories in the country. Washington’s move is seen as boosting Manila’s
chip sector amid intense competition with Beijing. </p>
<p>Blinken will start his trip late Thursday, heading first to Vienna
for a meeting of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs. His
trip will include a stop in Seoul where South Korea is hosting a Summit
for Democracy.</p>
<p>The meeting between Marcos and Blinken is set against a backdrop of
increasing tension over territorial disputes in the South China Sea
between Manila and Beijing. Marcos has committed to upholding the
Philippines’ maritime claims, following Chinese President Xi Jinping’s
call for military preparedness for potential sea conflicts.  </p>
<p>A recent collision near the waters around Second Thomas Shoal (known
as Ren’ai Shoal in China) has further strained the relationship between
the two countries. The rich fishing ground is about 200 kilometers (124
miles) from the nearest Philippines island and 1,500 kilometers (932
miles) from China. </p>
<p>On March 5, the Philippine Coast Guard said Chinese ships carried out
dangerous maneuvers and fired water cannons on Philippine vessels,
causing multiple collisions, and damaging at least one Philippine
vessel.   </p>
<p>China accused the Philippines of intruding on its territory “without
the permission of the Chinese government.” A PRC spokesperson said the
Chinese foreign ministry “has lodged solemn representations with the
Philippines and expressed strong protest.” </p>
<p>According to an international tribunal’s legally binding decision
issued in July 2016, Second Thomas Shoal is located within the exclusive
economic zone of the Philippines, and China has no lawful maritime
claims to the waters around the low-tide feature. </p>
<p>Beijing has rejected the ruling, claiming “indisputable sovereignty”
over most of the South China Sea. </p>
<p>The United States said it stands with the Philippines. The State
Department issued a strong statement on March 5 to condemn “the PRC’s
repeated obstruction of Philippine vessels” and said Beijing’s actions
“show disregard for the safety and livelihoods of Filipinos and
international law.” </p>
<p>The White House has announced that it will host Japanese Prime
Minister Kishida Fumio for an official visit on April 10. Japanese media
outlet The Asahi Shimbun reported that leaders from Japan, the United
States and the Philippines are planning a summit in Washington around
that time.</p>

Aide Navarro, Convicted of Contempt of Congress, Must Report to
Prison</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — An appeals court denied Trump White House official Peter
Navarro ’s bid to stave off his jail sentence on contempt of Congress
charges Thursday.</p>
<p>Navarro has been ordered to report to a federal prison by March 19.
He argued he should stay free as he appeals his conviction for refusing
to cooperate with a congressional investigation into the January 6,
2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>But a three-judge panel of the federal appeals court in Washington
disagreed, finding his appeal wasn’t likely to reverse his conviction.
His attorneys did not immediately return messages seeking comment but
have previously indicated he would appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Navarro was the second Trump aide convicted of contempt of Congress
charges. Former White House adviser Steve Bannon previously received a
four-month sentence, but a different judge allowed him to remain free
pending appeal.</p>
<p>Navarro was found guilty of defying a subpoena for documents and a
deposition from the House January 6 committee. He served as a White
House trade adviser under then-President Donald Trump and later promoted
the Republican’s baseless claims of mass voter fraud in the 2020
election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Navarro has said he couldn’t cooperate with the committee because
Trump had invoked executive privilege. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta
barred him from making that argument at trial, however, finding that he
didn’t show Trump had actually invoked it.</p>

Targets VOA Reporter in Latest Round of Sanctions Against Americans</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A Voice of America reporter was among more than 200 U.S.
citizens sanctioned by the Russian government on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced Thursday that it
was sanctioning Jeff Seldin, who covers national security at VOA. Seldin
was among several reporters, including some from The Washington Post and
The New York Times, to be included in this latest spate of sanctions
against U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>In total, 227 American citizens were included in this round of
sanctions over what the Russian government said was “anti-Russian
activity.”</p>
<p>“Entry to the Russian Federation is closed to 227 Americans involved
in the development, implementation and justification of the Russophobic
course of the current U.S. administration,” the Russian foreign ministry
said in a statement on its website.</p>
<p>The announcement came just one day before the beginning of
presidential elections in Russia that President Vladimir Putin is almost
guaranteed to win.</p>
<p>Other journalists who were sanctioned included The Washington Post’s
Joseph Marks, Joseph Menn, Ellen Nakashima and Tim Starks. Robert Worth
from The New York Times was also on the list.</p>
<p>Seldin directed VOA to the outlet’s public relations team.</p>
<p>“VOA’s mandate is to provide accurate, objective, and comprehensive
news and information to every part of the world,” the outlet said in a
statement. “We stand by Jeff’s reporting and will not be deterred from
serving our audience in Russia.”</p>
<p>Seldin isn’t the first VOA journalist to be sanctioned by Moscow.
VOA’s former acting director, Yolanda Lopez, was sanctioned by the
Russian government in May 2023.</p>
<p>Government officials, including U.S. State Department spokesperson
Matthew Miller, were included on the new list.</p>
<p>“We are deeply concerned by the Kremlin’s escalating attempts to
restrict freedom of expression and media freedom in Russia,” a State
Department spokesperson told VOA in a statement.</p>
<p>“In the strongest possible terms, we condemn the Kremlin’s continued
attempts to intimidate, repress, and punish independent journalists and
civil society voices, including through the use of censorship laws to
punish criticism of Russia’s brutal war,” the statement continued.</p>
<p>Moscow also sanctioned a slew of professors from various universities
including Harvard, Yale and Columbia.</p>
<p>For Peter Clement, who teaches courses on Russian security policy at
Columbia, being included in this round of sanctions didn’t come as a
shock.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t surprised. It’s consistent with past Russian policy to
issue what they view as reciprocal sanctions,” Clement told VOA.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has blocked more than 2,000 Americans from entering
Russia in what it says is a response to U.S. sanctions against Russian
individuals and companies.</p>
<p>The United States and other Western countries have hit Russia with a
massive wave of sanctions in response to its war against Ukraine.</p>
<p>Some information in this report came from Agence France-Presse.</p>

<p>
Tesla is starting to offer LFP battery pack retrofits for earlier Model
3 vehicles as it starts running out of the old battery pack.
</p>
<p>
However, it is still only for people under warranty. Tesla is not big on
payable battery pack upgrades – not that it is often needed anyway.

economic opportunity. But rather than chasing higher-paying jobs, more
Americans are reluctant to move — and housing costs have something to do
with it. Plus, there’s plenty of economic data on the table to discuss:
Wholesale inflation came in warm but not hot, retail sales rebounded,
and unemployment has stayed under 4% for 25 months now.

<a href="https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/photos/14870/images/cropped/Population_Distribution_GOH_Rhino.jpg?1513549364" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">once
roamed</a> from Pakistan to Bangladesh, but their numbers plummeted in
the 20th century. Many cultures throughout Asia believe rhino horns have
medicinal properties, making the creatures they’re attached to
vulnerable to poaching. Rajas and royals prized rhinos as trophy kills.
Farmers, also, retaliated with violence against rhinos that pillaged
their crops. By 1970 there were just 95 rhinos in the national park, a
wilderness bigger than New York City.
</p>
<p>
Eventually, however, the government realized that wildlife protection
attracts dollars. For decades now, the United States Agency for
International Development and non-governmental organizations like the
World Wildlife Fund have supported Nepal’s efforts to boost conservation
and lessen human wildlife conflict. Between 2011 and 2020 alone, $57
million of USAID funding went to programs aimed at protecting
biodiversity here. Soldiers now patrol the park to stifle poaching.
</p>
<p>
But while the rhino population has rebounded to nearly 700 in Chitwan,
the animals themselves are hardly thriving. As temperatures rise,
there’s been less rain during monsoon season. Warming temperatures have
fueled invasive species like American creeper vines that have taken over
rhino habitat and grow three inches daily. Climate change has also dried
up staple rhino foods like elephant grass and aquatic plants. Now, there
are too many rhinos and not enough forest, which forces the animals out
of the park and into the city. (The same goes
<a href="https://english.onlinekhabar.com/nepal-tiger-problem.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">for
tigers</a>.)
</p>
<p>
The particular rhino wading near us is named Meghauli. Each morning,
like clockwork, he comes
<a href="https://twitter.com/gunsnrosesgirl3/status/1748680578730275073/video/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">out
of the forest</a> and
<a href="https://twitter.com/pubity/status/1685358264244912128/video/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">into
town</a>. Meghauli is a bona fide
<a href="https://twitter.com/kiranjoshi235/status/1760135228822343795" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">social
media star</a>. When he thuds down the road traffic stops and a parade
of hypnotized Nepalis and foreigners

<a href="https://twitter.com/KapilKoirala9/status/1556499499828527104/video/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">touch</a>
his leathery hide.
</p>
<p>
Meghauli was hand-raised by park staff after he was found alone, wounded
from a tiger attack. Fed on 18 liters of buffalo milk a day, he grew big
and strong — and also lost his fear of humans. Four years later he was
released, but he kept returning because it’s easier to find food in town
than in the increasingly dry and crowded jungle.
</p>
<p>
Rhinos are everywhere in the populated regions around the park — wading
in streams, but also painted in murals, memorialized in hotel names, and
depicted in statues. The uncomfortable truth is that the rhinos’ plight
has also created a lucrative tourist opportunity. Rajendra Dhami, who
runs a tea shop in front of Meghauli’s main crossing point, a shallow
river with basking crocodiles and waiting tourists, tells me the rhinos
have become a big attraction. “People come to see rhinos since we have
them,” he says. “That means more money for us.”
</p>
<p>
A pair of young Brits and an Indian family of nine are currently
gathered, waiting for Meghauli, but Dhami insists that for the most
part, it doesn’t matter which rhino shows up. “We have lots of problems
in Nepal,” he tells me, “but we share with wildlife.”
</p>
<p>
It’s true visitors often choose hotels and shops near wildlife. But a
recent 20-year
<a href="https://csc.apf.gov.np/admin-panel/docs/20190307145026.pdf#page=77" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study
found</a> that nature-based tourism rarely impacts locals, in part
because hotel bookings are often made online with fancy tour operators
who act as middlemen and skim off revenue much the same way food
delivery sites take from restaurants. Meanwhile, just six of the 93
hotels here are owned or managed by indigenous people, according to the
Regional Hotel Association Chitwan. For most Nepalis, especially in poor
indigenous communities who rely on farming here, rhinos running around
is bad for bottom lines — and bellies.
</p>
<p>
“Cabbage, cauliflower, potatoes, rhinos like it all very much” says
Narayan Rijal, who has worked as a park guide for 15 years. ”That’s the
problem.”
</p>
<p>
But people, also, are hungry. Many here are in such need of food that
they’re invading rhino habitat to find fruits, honey, and meat.
Impoverished communities illegally enter the park to gather firewood, a
cycle that increases deforestation, shrinks habitat, and risks deadly
rhino, elephant, and
<a href="https://english.onlinekhabar.com/tiger-attack-in-chitwan.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tiger
attacks</a>.
</p>
<p>
Tulsi Magar, a guide at the local
<a href="https://sanctuarynepal.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sanctuary</a>
hotel, says many attacks are because farmers are so desperate to protect
their own food that they stand their ground and light fires to try and
scare off hungry rhinos. When Magar was 12, he also fought this way,
sleeping in a shed and narrowly avoiding losing his life to protect the
family’s radish harvest.
</p>
<p>
“It didn’t work,’ he remembers. “The rhinos won.”
</p>
<p>
Soldiers try their best to manage the rhinos, trailing them as they
leave the park to forage in farmers’ fields. Once they reach town,
soldiers often have to hit them with sticks or their rifle butts to get
them to return to the forest.
</p>
<p>
“They‘re not small animals,” an assistant warden says as a rooster crows
outside his office. “We try to push rhinos back into the core area. With
Meghauli no need for stick, we just push. We do our best.”
</p>
<p>
Meghauli has a lookalike named Madi, another rescue. Unlike Meghauli,
Madi is angry, park staff say, asking me to avoid using their names for
fear of speaking openly. “Madi even charged a few taxis by the airport,”
they admit. “He’s very aggressive.”
</p>
<p>
Rhinos have killed 55 people since 1998, including a
<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6905915/Australian-tourist-fights-life-mauled-rhino-safari-Nepal.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2019
attack on safari-going tourists</a>. Last year alone, rhinos killed
<a href="https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-3/2023/02/21/man-dies-in-chitwan-rhino-attack" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">five</a>.
“They’re more dangerous than tigers,” notes Isswari Chapagain who has
climbed trees to avoid charges.
</p>
<p>
Rhinos aren’t just a threat to locals, he says. They’re also a threat to
each other. Wild rhinos go nuts and attack orphans like Meghauli and
Madi if they smell people on them — another reason they keep coming back
to town.
</p>
<p>
As the park has become famous and rhinos have rebounded, human
activities like road expansion have been linked to a string of strange
deaths:
<a href="https://kathmandupost.com/national/2023/01/23/latest-killing-of-two-rhinos-in-chitwan-sanctuary-alarms-conservationists" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">165</a>
rhinos killed from falling into roadside ditches and septic tanks,
shocks from electric fences, disease (likely from proximity to
livestock), and at least six killed by poachers. In 2022 alone,
<a href="https://english.onlinekhabar.com/chitwan-national-park-rhino-deaths.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">36
rhinos died</a> from territorial fights, which are also connected to
warming temperatures and habitat loss. Construction on Chitwan’s three
main rivers changes their flow, shrinks space, increases food
competition and pushes rhinos into fields.
</p>
<p>
Rhinos are protected even if they attack or leave the park boundaries,
but people aren’t. If they’re attacked in the park, Nepalis can claim
government compensation (although guides cannot). If they’re at home
protecting their farms and a rhino mauls them, they get nothing, another
reason
<a href="https://phys.org/news/2022-12-rhino-nepal-burden-communities-infrastructure.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">researchers
accuse</a> the government of continuing to
<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14724049.2022.2139833" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prioritize
wildlife</a> over people.
</p>
<p>
Back under the bridge, I watch Meghauli blow bubbles under the water,
just like a kid.
</p>
<p>
When he rises, I see his massive body in full for the first time. He
seems gentle but it wouldn’t take much — a jerk of his head or a kick
from a leg — for him to kill someone. He exits the water and trudges up
the riverbank, then pauses to scan the highway. He faces me and sniffs
the air, then turns toward a potato field. It’s lunchtime.

id="trump-arrives-at-hearing-on-whether-to-dismiss-classified-documents-case">Trump
Arrives at Hearing on Whether to Dismiss Classified Documents Case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>FORT PIERCE, FLORIDA — Donald Trump arrived Thursday at a federal
courthouse in Florida, where a judge will hear arguments on whether to
dismiss the criminal case accusing the former president of hoarding
classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left the White
House. </p>
<p>The motorcade carrying the 2024 Republican presumptive presidential
nominee arrived shortly before the hearing was set to begin before U.S.
District Judge Aileen Cannon, who was nominated to the bench by
Trump. </p>
<p>The dispute centers on the Trump team’s interpretation of the
Presidential Records Act, which they say gave him the authority to
designate the documents as personal and maintain possession of them
after his presidency. </p>
<p>Special counsel Jack Smith’s team, by contrast, says the files Trump
is charged with possessing are presidential records, not personal ones,
and that the statute does not apply to classified and top-secret
documents such as those kept at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. </p>
<p>The Presidential Records Act “does not exempt Trump from the criminal
law, entitle him to unilaterally declare highly classified presidential
records to be personal records, or shield him from criminal
investigations — let alone allow him to obstruct a federal investigation
with impunity,” prosecutors wrote in a court filing last week. </p>
<p>It was not clear when Cannon might rule, but the outcome will
determine whether the case proceeds or whether, as Trump’s lawyers hope,
it is thrown out before ever reaching a jury — a rare action for a judge
to take. </p>
<p>Cannon is also expected to hear arguments Thursday on a separate but
related Trump team motion that says the statute that forms the bulk of
the criminal charges — making it a crime to willfully retain national
defense information — is unconstitutionally vague as it applies to a
former president. </p>
<p>It is not surprising that defense lawyers are seeking dismissal of
the case based on the Presidential Records Act given that the legal team
has repeatedly invoked the statute since the FBI’s August 2022 search of
Mar-a-Lago. </p>
<p>The law, enacted in 1978, requires presidents upon leaving office to
transfer their presidential records to the U.S. government for
management — specifically, the National Archives and Records
Administration — although they are permitted to retain personal records,
including diaries and notes that are purely private and not prepared for
government business. </p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers have said that he designated as personal property the
records he took with him to Mar-a-Lago, which prosecutors say included
top-secret information and documents related to nuclear programs and the
military capabilities of the U.S. and foreign adversaries. </p>
<p>Cannon has suggested in the past that she sees Trump’s status as a
former president as distinguishing him from others who have held onto
classified records. </p>
<p>After the Trump team sued the Justice Department in 2022 to get his
records back, Cannon appointed a special master to conduct an
independent review of the documents taken during the FBI’s Mar-a-Lago
search. That appointment was later overturned by a federal appeals
court. </p>
<p>More recently, even while ruling in favor of Smith’s team on a
procedural question, Cannon pointedly described the case as the
“first-ever criminal prosecution of a former United States President —
once the country’s chief classification authority over many of the
documents the Special Counsel now seeks to withhold from him (and his
cleared counsel) — in a case without charges of transmission or delivery
of national defense information.” </p>
<p>Trump faces 40 felony counts in Florida that accuse him of willfully
retaining dozens of classified documents and rebuffing government
demands to give them back after he left the White House. Prosecutors in
recent court filings have stressed the scope of criminal conduct that
they say they expect to prove at trial, saying in one that “there has
never been a case in American history in which a former official has
engaged in conduct remotely similar to Trump’s.” </p>
<p>They allege, for instance, that Trump intentionally held onto some of
the nation’s most sensitive documents — only returning a fraction of
them upon demand by the National Archives — and then urged his lawyer to
hide records and to lie to the FBI by saying he no longer was in
possession of them. He’s also charged with enlisting staff to delete
surveillance footage that would show boxes of documents being moved
around the property. </p>
<p>The hearing is the second this month in the case in Florida, one of
four prosecutions Trump confronts as he seeks to reclaim the White House
this year. Cannon heard arguments on March 1 on when to set a trial date
but has not ruled yet. Both sides have proposed summertime dates for the
trial to begin.</p>

US Investments in Philippines Seen Easing Reliance on China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Taipei, Taiwan — During a trade mission visit to Manila this week,
U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo announced plans to invest more
than $1 billion in the Philippines’ tech sector and help double the
number of semiconductor factories in the country.</p>
<p>Observers say the pledge and visit highlight the Southeast Asian
nation’s growing importance to Washington and will also help reduce the
Philippine economy’s reliance on China.</p>
<p>“U.S. companies have realized that our chip supply chain is way too
concentrated in just a few countries in the world,” Raimondo said in
remarks at a business forum on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“Forget about geopolitics. Just at that level of concentration, you
know the old adage, ‘Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.’ Why do we
allow ourselves to be buying so many of our chips from one or two
countries? That’s why we need to diversify,” Raimondo said.</p>
<p>American business executives from 22 businesses, including Alphabet’s
Google, Visa and Microsoft, joined Raimondo on the trip.</p>
<p>Possible expansion of chip industry</p>
<p>JC Punongbayan, resident economist and columnist of the online news
website Rappler.com, said that while the Philippines is one of the key
centers in the global electronics industry chain, it does not yet have
the ability to manufacture smartphone or computer chips. The Philippines
currently has 13 semiconductor factories that focus on assembly,
packaging and testing.</p>
<p>“This commitment by the U.S. government to boost the local
semiconductor industry is a welcome development because right now, even
if semiconductors have figured prominently in trade statistics, these
are not high value-added. So basically, we import a lot of components
and then export them after assembly and packaging,” Punongbayan told
VOA’s Mandarin Service.</p>
<p>“Hopefully, these investments by the U.S. government and private
sector partners will enable the Philippines to export higher value-added
goods in the future,” he said.</p>
<p>Punongbayan believes that at a time when the Philippines is working
hard to amend its regulations and hoping to attract more foreign direct
investment, the promised investment from U.S. companies could provide a
strong boost to the capital-starved country.</p>
<p>“We have had some difficulties when it comes to attracting foreign
investments. And in fact, from 2020 to 2023, foreign direct investments
dropped by more than 6% on an annual basis. So, we really need these
investments in order to boost the economy,” Punongbayan said.</p>
<p>“And the billion-dollar investment pledge of the U.S. is several
times the actual foreign direct investments that have come in recent
years — in fact, almost nine times the foreign direct investment from
the U.S. in 2023. These are very crucial to Philippine development,” he
said.</p>
<p>During Raimondo’s two-day visit, U.S. companies committed to invest
in the digital and energy sectors, areas that are in line with Manila’s
overall development plans and will help the Philippines’ industrial
upgrading and transformation, Punongbayan said.</p>
<p>Defense and economy</p>
<p>Dindo Manhit, president of the Stratbase ADR Institute for Strategic
and International Studies, a policy think tank in the Philippines, said
that over the years, the Philippines’ economic growth has been mainly
driven by strong consumption.</p>
<p>These investment commitments by U.S. companies will accelerate local
economic growth, Manhit said, benefiting both the public and private
sectors and positively affecting areas such as the Philippines’
manufacturing supply chain and business process outsourcing.</p>
<p>He said these investments could also allow Manila to fully understand
that strengthening its alliance with Washington will not only bring it
defense assistance but also economic security.</p>
<p>“Because we all share values, democratic values. We value jobs for
people. In the case of the Philippines, imagine if we can create jobs
that could provide better income for Filipinos,” Manhit said. “Then we
will see the strong partnership with the U.S. not limited to national
security only, but also economic security.”</p>
<p>Washington’s pledges of economic support for the Philippines comes at
a time of rising tensions between Manila and Beijing over sovereignty
disputes in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Enrique
Manalo warned that Manila is facing severe “economic coercion” from
China. He also said the Philippines relies heavily on trade relations
with China and hopes to expand economic and trade connections with other
countries, including establishing formal free trade agreement
negotiations with the European Union as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Punongbayan said that despite the disputes in the South China Sea,
Manila continues to import a large amount of goods from China, which is
the largest source of the country’s trade deficit. That shows how
difficult it is for the country to decouple its economy from China, and
why it is imperative for Manila to lessen its dependence on Beijing.</p>
<p>Greater interest from the United States to invest in the Philippines
is a step in the right direction, he said.</p>
<p>“If we import a lot from China, then indirectly we are boosting
China’s economy at the same time. And of course, part of the revenues
coming from these payments to China will go to the Chinese government,”
Punongbayan said. “So indirectly, in a way, the Philippines is funding
China’s incursions in the West Philippine Sea.”</p>
<p>Manhit, however, said compared with other Southeast Asian countries,
the Philippine economy is not very dependent on China.</p>
<p>According to recent poll by Stratbase ADR Institute for Strategic and
International Studies, the country Filipinos most want to maintain good
economic relations with is the U.S., followed by Japan, while China
ranks at the bottom.</p>
<p>He said the poll not only shows that China does not have as strong an
economic influence on the Philippines as Beijing claims, but also that
Filipinos are unanimously willing to expand economic cooperation with
countries that share common democratic values, or values of human rights
and the rule of law.</p>

id="worlds-largest-drone-maker-expands-in-us-amid-rights-abuse-allegations">World’s
Largest Drone Maker Expands in US Amid Rights Abuse Allegations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Chinese drone maker DJI is expanding in the U.S. with
its first flagship store in New York City amid allegations of links to
human rights abuses and ties to China’s military.</p>
<p>DJI’s “first concept” North American store on New York’s Fifth Avenue
welcomes customers into a futuristic, minimalist space to shop. The
company describes itself on its website as “the world’s leader in civil
drones and creative camera technology.”</p>
<p>“We continue to see growing consumer demand throughout North America
as we expand our consumer product portfolio,” said Christina Zhang,
senior director of corporate strategy at DJI.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Shenzhen, China, the company was founded in 2006.
DJI, also known as Da Jiang Innovations, has become the world’s largest
drone maker, having achieved global dominance in less than 20 years. The
company now supplies 70% of the world’s consumer drones and nearly 80%
of U.S. consumer drones.</p>
<p>Abuse allegations</p>
<p>On March 5, the day of DJI’s official store opening in New York, the
Uyghur Human Rights Project (UHRP), a Washington research and advocacy
group, released a report titled Surveillance Tech Series: DJI’s Links to
Human Rights Abuses in East Turkistan.</p>
<p>The report accuses DJI of being involved in mass surveillance and
rights violations against Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz and other Muslim
communities in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, which the
group calls East Turkistan.</p>
<p>“DJI is directly involved in mass surveillance schemes in East
Turkistan and has supplied public security agencies with tools to
surveil and target Uyghurs, Kazakh, and Kyrgyz people,” the UHRP report
said. “Xinjiang public security departments entered into seven
procurement orders with DJI that were worth nearly US$300,000 between
2019 and 2022.”</p>
<p>The report stated that DJI sells drones to Xinjiang’s paramilitary
organization, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, which the
U.S. government sanctioned because of its “connection with serious
rights abuses against ethnic minorities” in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>“Other documents show tenders worth US$47,000 for DJI drones for the
Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps,” the UHRP report stated.</p>
<p>The report also said that a DJI drone captured footage of dozens of
individuals, seemingly Uyghur prisoners, blindfolded and shackled at a
train station in southern Xinjiang. The video, first released on YouTube
in 2019, garnered widespread media attention.</p>
<p>“It’s unethical to support a company that knowingly engages in
egregious rights violations,” Nuzigum Setiwaldi, the report’s author,
told Voice of America.</p>
<p>The U.S. and several Western parliaments have accused China of
genocide in Xinjiang, targeting Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim
populations. The U.N. human rights office released a report saying the
human rights violations in Xinjiang may amount to crimes against
humanity. China criticized Western nations for spreading “lies” about
human rights in Xinjiang and Tibet.</p>
<p>A spokesperson from DJI told VOA the company has not engaged in any
activities, including sales distribution and product development, that
violate or abuse human rights.</p>
<p>“Like other manufacturers, we do not have control over how our
products are used as they are available off the shelf,” wrote a DJI
spokesperson in an email response. “However, we have demonstrated –
through years of investments in product safety and security initiatives
– that our products are developed for peaceful and civilian use
only.”</p>
<p>Chinese military company or not?</p>
<p>In 2022, The Washington Post reported that DJI obscured ties to
Chinese government funding.</p>
<p>In the same year, the U.S. Department of Defense classified DJI as a
“Chinese military company.” As of January, DJI remains on the list of
such companies operating in the United States. The department said it
maintains companies on the list to counter China’s Military-Civil Fusion
strategy, which supports the modernization of the Chinese army.</p>
<p>Reuters reported that former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who
ran the U.S. Justice Department from 2015 to 2017 and is now with the
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison law firm, wrote a letter to
the Defense Department last July on behalf of DJI, urging the removal of
her client from the Pentagon’s Chinese military companies list.</p>
<p>In her letter, Lynch cited the importance and urgency of such a move
because of the wide use of and dependence on DJI products by a variety
of U.S. stakeholders.</p>
<p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned in
January that Chinese-made drones posed “significant risk” to U.S.
national security and critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>“[T]he PRC’s 2017 National Intelligence Law compels Chinese companies
to cooperate with state intelligence services, including providing
access to data collected within China and around the world,” CISA said
in its cybersecurity guidance on Chinese manufactured drones or unmanned
aircraft systems (UAS).</p>
<p>However, DJI’s spokesperson told VOA that DJI “is not a Chinese
military company.”</p>
<p>According to DJI, the company remains one of the few drone companies
that clearly “denounce and actively discourage” the use of drones in
combat.</p>
<p>“We do not pursue business opportunities for combat use or
operations. Our distributors, resellers and other business partners
globally have also committed to following this policy when they sell and
use our products,” DJI spokesperson said.</p>

clean hydrogen. The funding will also help support fuel cell production,
as well as research into “recovery, recycling, and reuse of clean
hydrogen materials and components.” This is the first distribution of

<li>Shell walks back some emissions pledges
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Oil giant Shell is watering down its commitment to
scale back carbon emissions in the next few years. The company pledged
in 2021 to reduce its “net carbon intensity” by 20% by 2030, but has
adjusted that to between 15% and 20%, according to its latest energy
transition strategy update. The goal of a 45% reduction by 2035 has been
scrapped entirely. Net carbon intensity is a bit of a confusing term.
Shell

it as “emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell.” The
<em>Financial Times

it</a> “an accounting treatment that allows Shell to offset the carbon
produced by its oil and gas business against its growing sales of
lower-carbon products.”<br/> <br/> “The change reflects Shell’s move
away from supplying renewable power to homes,”
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e9552bb251&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>

it aims to “reduce customer emissions” – or Scope 3 emissions – from its
oil products by 15% to 20% by 2030. How? By “reducing sales of oil
products, such as petrol and diesel, as we support customers as they
move to electric mobility and lower-carbon fuels, including natural gas,
LNG and biofuels.” The company claims it can still get to net-zero
emissions by 2050.

Greece</a> for failing to manage flood risk. Under the European Green
Deal, all EU member states are required to comply with water rules that
help ensure, among other things, good management of river basins to help
prepare for floods. The commission said that “Greece has so far not
reviewed, adopted nor reported its river basin management plans,” and it
is therefore referring the country to the EU’s high court. Greece isn’t
the only country under pressure: The commission has also sued Bulgaria,
Cyprus, Spain, Ireland, Malta, Portugal, and Slovakia for their own
reporting failures. But the lawsuit against Greece comes five months
after the country experienced historic floods in its Thessaly plain,
“devastating crops and livestock and raising questions about the
Mediterranean country’s ability to deal with an increasingly erratic
climate,”

operations in the U.S. may be emitting three times as much methane as

methane emissions because the gas often leaks from oil wells and gas

measurements from aerial surveys over six major oil- and gas-producing
regions in the U.S. – suggests we’ve been underestimating the size of
these leaks, making projects like the

<li>The U.K. has more giant redwoods than California

<p>
Most people associate giant sequoias with the forests of California, but
new research finds the trees are far more plentiful in Britain. The
giant redwood was introduced to the UK in 1853 and has since thrived.
There are an estimated 500,000 sequoias in the UK, compared with 80,000

drought threaten California’s redwoods, “in the UK our climate is more
temperate, wetter, and so it is actually likely better suited to these
trees in the long run,” said Dr Mathias Disney from University College
London, one of the authors of the study.
</p>
<p>
To estimate the UK trees’ biomass, the researchers used laser scanning
to measure the height of 97 trees from three locations. Here they are,

On Wednesday, the House of Representatives’ passed a bill with
bipartisan support that would force parent company ByteDance to either
divest — to sell off — TikTok or see the app banned from U.S. app
stores. But could such a divestiture happen? And would TikTok still be
TikTok? Also on the program: The stock market is on a tear. Zanny Minton
Beddoes, editor of The Economist, calls it “rational exuberance.”

Marking the Web’s 35th Birthday: A Shorter Letter</h2>

2024-03-13 Marking the Web’s 35th Birthday: A Shorter Letter
</h1>
<p>
I think there are people with more interesting ideas than what Tim
Berners-Lee has to say, given what I just read.
<a href="https://medium.com/@timberners_lee/marking-the-webs-35th-birthday-an-open-letter-ebb410cc7d42">His
post</a> is on Medium so I had to read in eww, the browser built into
Emacs. 😂 The most interesting fragment was this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
collectivise their solutions, and … overturn the online world being
dictated by profit to one that is dictated by the needs of humanity
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s pretty much out of context because it follows something like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
there is a need, an urgent need, for others to do the same, to back the
morally courageous leadership that is rising
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
How weird is that? I started thinking. Where is that morally courageous
leadership that is rising? Are they morally courageous but not in other
ways? Is their morality courageous because their morals aren’t
recognized as morals or their morals might seem amoral to others? Or is
amorality considered moral in the mainstream? Or isn’t it rather that
the mainstream knows full well what is moral but can’t help the systemic
pressures of having to earn money? Why isn’t he advocating for system
change? Is that what collectivisation is about? What exactly are we
collectivising? The solutions? The products? The capital? Or is he just
saying that the morally ambiguous but courageous leaders have ideas that
we, collectively, ought to support? And the “fundamental change” he has
in mind are “Contract for the Web” and “Solid Protocol”? I… I don’t
know… We must “champion the efforts of those visionary individuals who
are actively working to build a new, improved system”? It just feels so
weird. How about this alternative:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
We need a web that is built for the people, by the people.
</li>
<li>
We need free ourselves from the shackles and fetters of corporations.
</li>
<li>
Remove corporations and their representatives from all governing bodies
and committees.
</li>
<li>
All positions to be paid positions. Don’t let those on the corporate
payrolls take over.
</li>
<li>
One human, one vote. No strings attached. Don’t tie votes to membership
fees. This is for all of humanity.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
It took me two minutes to write something that seemed a bit more
visionary than what Tim Berners-Lee had in mind and if you like it,
please don’t champion me but talk to some friends and do a little thing,
no matter how small, to support a few more people on the web. Run a
forum, a wiki, provide email services, run a fediverse instance, run a
HTML course at the library, collect money for a mutual aid fund,
something, anything. The only conditions are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
it must be a concrete thing that you are actually doing
</li>
<li>
it must benefit more people than are involved in doing it
</li>
</ol>
<p>
It’s OK to cap it. But it’s important to start it. Just make it a point
to enable somebody else. And just like that, we’re taking back the web.

<h2 id="china-says-us-tiktok-vote-follows-logic-of-a-bandit">China Says
US TikTok Vote Follows ‘Logic of a Bandit’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIJING — China on Thursday said the U.S. House of Representatives’
approval of a bill that would force TikTok to sever ties with its
Chinese parent company or be banned in the United States follows
“entirely the logic of a bandit.”</p>
<p>The short-video app has soared in popularity worldwide but its
ownership by Chinese technology giant ByteDance — and alleged
subservience to Beijing’s ruling Communist Party — has fueled concern in
Western capitals.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly
approved a bill that would force TikTok to divest from its parent
company or face a nationwide ban.</p>
<p>The bill is yet to pass the Senate, where it is expected to face a
tougher test to become law.</p>
<p>“The bill passed by the United States House of Representatives puts
the United States on the opposite side of the principles of fair
competition and international economic and trade rules,” foreign
ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a regular press conference.</p>
<p>“If so-called reasons of national security can be used to arbitrarily
suppress excellent companies from other countries, then there is no
fairness and justice at all,” he said.</p>
<p>“When someone sees a good thing another person has and tries to take
it for themself, this is entirely the logic of a bandit.</p>
<p>“The United States’ handling of the TikTok incident will allow the
world to see more clearly whether the United States’ so-called rules and
order are beneficial to the world, or whether they only serve the United
States itself.”</p>

<h2 id="biden-keeps-israel-close-but-netanyahu-away">Biden Keeps Israel
Close, but Netanyahu Away</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — With increasingly frequent and vocal expressions of
frustration, U.S. President Joe Biden appears to be distancing himself
from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has vowed that
international pressure will not prevent Israel from achieving “total
victory” in its war against Hamas.</p>
<p>The rift is fueling speculation that the U.S. might restrict the
supply of American weapons, particularly if Netanyahu moves to “finish
the job” against Hamas in Rafah, where more than a million displaced
Palestinians are sheltered.</p>
<p>Placing conditions on military aid would be Washington’s strongest
leverage to affect Israel’s conduct of the war, which has killed more
than 31,000 Palestinians according to Gaza’s health ministry.</p>
<p>While U.S. media have quoted anonymous administration sources saying
they are considering that option, officially the White House has
declined to “entertain hypotheticals.”</p>
<p>“The president has been very clear about our position on Rafah,”
national security adviser Jake Sullivan said during Tuesday’s White
House briefing. “A military operation in Rafah that does not protect
civilians, that cuts off the main arteries of humanitarian assistance,
and that places enormous pressure on the Israel-Egypt border, is not
something that he can support.”</p>
<p>Biden himself was ambiguous about whether invading Rafah would cross
a red line, saying he would never abandon Israel. At the same time, he
rebuked the Netanyahu government for the way it has gone after Hamas
following the militant group’s Oct. 7 attack that killed 1,200 people in
Israel and took more than 240 hostage.</p>
<p>“The defense of Israel is still critical, so there’s no red line
[where] I’m going to cut off all weapons, so they don’t have the Iron
Dome to protect them,” he said in a recent interview with MSNBC, even as
he underscored that Israel “cannot have 30,000 more Palestinians
dead.”</p>
<p>However, the president is telegraphing his rebukes. Caught on a hot
mic while speaking to a Democratic senator last week, Biden said that he
has told Netanyahu they are heading for a “come to Jesus” meeting, an
expression for having a blunt conversation.</p>
<p>Told by an aide that he could be heard, Biden said, “Good. That’s
good.”</p>
<p>Electoral goals</p>
<p>Biden’s increasingly public criticism of Netanyahu comes as he ramps
up his campaign for reelection in November. The president faces
competing constituencies within his Democratic base.</p>
<p>He cannot afford to give Republicans an opportunity to capture
pro-Israel votes. But he also needs to stop progressive Democrats, young
voters, Muslim and Arab Americans from abandoning him, as threatened by
the significant portion of voters in some Democratic primaries who
marked their ballots “uncommitted” to signal their outrage at the
president’s support for Israel.</p>
<p>To address his domestic politics and foreign policy goals, Biden is
“performing a political amputation of Bibi,” said Laura Blumenfeld, a
senior fellow at Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International
Studies, using a nickname for Netanyahu.</p>
<p>The goal, Blumenfeld told VOA, is to separate what Biden considers
Netanyahu’s “toxic war policies” from the state of Israel so that the
president can follow his political instincts: to protect Israel from
further attacks and facilitate the release of hostages “without
sacrificing his moral core.”</p>
<p>Biden’s souring on Netanyahu may not be enough to appease
pro-Palestinian Americans, particularly if a cease-fire isn’t secured
soon. “Uncommitted” voters say they would abandon the president even
when Biden surrogates point out that the Republican presumptive nominee,
Donald Trump, known for his anti-Muslim rhetoric and policies, is likely
to give Israel freer rein over its war conduct.</p>
<p>“I’ve lived through four years of Trump,” said Samraa Luqman,
co-chair of the Abandon Biden campaign in Michigan. Palestinians, she
told VOA, “cannot live through another Joe Biden presidency.”</p>
<p>Trump has avoided stating an explicit position on the war other than
saying in a Fox News interview that Israel must “finish the problem” and
that the “horrible invasion” by Hamas “would have never happened” if he
were president.</p>
<p>Netanyahu hits back</p>
<p>In response to Biden’s criticism that Netanyahu is “hurting Israel
more than helping Israel,” the prime minister hit back, saying in an
interview with Politico that he has the support of the Israeli
people.</p>
<p>If Biden meant “that I’m pursuing private policies against the
majority, the wish of the majority of Israelis, and that this is hurting
the interests of Israel, then he’s wrong on both counts,” Netanyahu
said.</p>
<p>Only 15% of Israelis want Netanyahu to stay in office after the war
ends, according to a poll by Israel Democracy Institute. But 56% believe
that continuing the military offensive is the best way to recover the
hostages.</p>
<p>In general, Israelis are focused on toppling Hamas, said Jonathan
Rynhold, head of the Department of Political Studies at Israel’s
Bar-Ilan University. To them, protecting civilians and providing
humanitarian aid are “details,” he told VOA. “They don’t understand the
significance in America.”</p>
<p>Distrust in Netanyahu</p>
<p>Earlier this week, an annual threat assessment released by the U.S.
Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) cited deepening
“distrust of Netanyahu’s ability to rule” since the war broke. The prime
minister’s “viability as leader” may be in jeopardy, the report
said.</p>
<p>“It’s clear that the U.S. administration is going after Netanyahu,”
said Nimrod Goren, senior fellow for Israeli Affairs at the Middle East
Institute.</p>
<p>As the process toward a political transition in Israel begins, Goren
told VOA, the U.S. “is an actor in it.”</p>
<p>The ODNI report noted that “a different, more moderate government is
a possibility,” drawing ire from Israeli officials who felt snubbed
earlier this month when Israeli war Cabinet member Benny Gantz was
received by Vice President Kamala Harris, Sullivan and Democratic
congressional leaders.</p>
<p>Many see Gantz’s invitation to Washington as a sign of the
administration’s support, should the popular centrist politician become
Israel’s next prime minister.</p>
<p>Asked by VOA if Gantz’s visit is a signal that the administration is
looking forward to an Israeli government without Netanyahu, national
security communications adviser John Kirby flatly said, “No.”</p>

<p>While U.S. President Joe Biden has continued to support Israel’s war
against Hamas, he appears to be distancing himself from Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The apparent rift between the leaders has
fueled speculation that the U.S. might restrict military aid in a bid to
influence Israel’s conduct in Gaza. VOA’s White House Bureau Chief Patsy
Widakuswara has this story.</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-14, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog</p>
<p>After yesterday’s primary contests, we appear headed toward a
Biden-Trump rematch in 2024. But this year’s election is an entirely
different kettle of fish than that of 2020. In 2020 there were plenty of
red flags around Trump’s plans for a second term, but it was not until
after it was clear he had lost the election that he gave up all pretense
of normal presidential behavior. Beginning the night of the election, he
tried to overturn that election and to install himself as president,
ignoring the will of the voters, who had chosen Joe Biden. His attack on
the fundamental principle of democracy ended the tradition of the
peaceful transfer of power established in 1797 when our first president,
George Washington, deliberately walked behind his successor, John Adams,
after Adams was sworn into office.</p>

id="biden-to-raise-concern-over-nippon-steels-deal-for-us-steel">Biden
to Raise Concern Over Nippon Steel’s Deal for US Steel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden plans to express concern over
Nippon Steel’s proposed $14.9 billion purchase of U.S. Steel, a person
familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, pushing the U.S. company’s
stock nearly 13% lower on bets the deal could face greater political
opposition.</p>
<p>The issue has the potential to overshadow an April 10 summit between
Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida aimed at boosting the
long-standing security alliance between their countries in the face of
growing Chinese strength.</p>
<p>In December, Nippon Steel clinched a deal to buy the 122-year-old
iconic U.S. steelmaker for a hefty premium, betting that U.S. Steel
would benefit from the spending and tax incentives in Biden’s
infrastructure bill.</p>
<p>However, several Democratic and Republican U.S. senators have
criticized the deal, citing national security concerns or raising
questions about why the two companies did not consult U.S. Steel’s main
union ahead of the announcement.</p>
<p>Donald Trump, Biden’s rival in the November U.S. presidential
election, has said he would block the acquisition of U.S. Steel if
elected. The White House said in December the deal needed to be
carefully scrutinized given U.S. Steel’s core role in producing a
material that is critical to national security. </p>
<p>The White House declined to comment on Wednesday, but a person
familiar with the matter said Biden would issue a statement about the
planned acquisition before Kishida arrives for his state visit.</p>
<p>U.S. officials and lawyers have drafted the statement, and the White
House has privately informed the Japanese government of Biden’s
decision, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the
news.</p>
<p>Japan’s top government spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi declined to
comment on the report. “The Japan-U.S. alliance is stronger than ever,
and the two countries will continue to work together … in the field of
economic security,” Hayashi, chief cabinet secretary, told reporters on
Thursday, echoing recent remarks by Japanese officials.</p>
<p>Matthew Goodman, a trade and economics expert at Washington’s Council
on Foreign Relations think tank, said the issue could overshadow the
summit and be damaging for Kishida, who is already struggling
politically at home.</p>
<p>“A prime minister of Japan has to demonstrate that he has the U.S.
relationship not only under control, but that he’s enhancing it,”
Goodman said. “So, to the extent this runs counter to that narrative
politically at home, it’s problematic.”</p>
<p>Goodman said he thought the case of the acquisition being a risk to
U.S. national security was “dubious” and questioning investments from a
supposedly trusted security partner could be very damaging to the
relationship.</p>
<p>“It’s much more to do with politics in an election year when both
nominees are appealing to support from steel workers and unions,” he
said of Biden and Trump.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel said they welcomed
the Biden administration’s scrutiny of the transaction, as “an objective
and comprehensive review of this transaction will demonstrate that it
strengthens U.S. jobs, competition, and economic and national
security.”</p>
<p>Goodman said there have been long-standing concerns in the United
States about Japanese labor practices and “non-support for unionization
of workers in Japanese-owned factories in the U.S. well beyond
steel.”</p>
<p>The companies said they have had “active, dedicated discussions with
the United Steelworkers, which are ongoing.” </p>
<p> U.S. Steel, founded in 1901 by some of the biggest U.S. magnates,
including Andrew Carnegie, J.P. Morgan and Charles Schwab, became
intertwined with the industrial recovery following the Great Depression
and World War II.</p>
<p>Last year, the Pittsburgh-based company launched a formal review of
its strategic options after rebuffing a takeover offer from steelmaker
Cleveland-Cliffs.</p>
<p>Its shares had come under pressure following several quarters of
falling revenue and profit, making it an attractive takeover target for
rivals looking to add a maker of steel used by the automobile
industry.</p>
<p>U.S. Steel shares closed 12.8% lower at $40.86 on Wednesday, well
below Nippon’s offer of $55 per share.</p>

Talks About Roads, Bridges, While Protesters Shout About Death in
Gaza</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Milwaukee, Wisconsin — U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday visited
Wisconsin, a key swing state that he narrowly won in 2020, meeting with
community members at a once shuttered but now thriving children’s
community center to sell them on how he believes his economic policies
are making their lives better.</p>
<p>Biden’s approval ratings in the Badger State have recently slumped,
and on Wednesday afternoon, as Biden chatted privately with campaign
volunteers at his new campaign headquarters in Milwaukee, less than a
block away, several dozen protesters took aim at one reason why.</p>
<p>“Free, free, free Palestine!” the group members yelled as they waved
Palestinian flags.</p>
<p>“Hey, Joe, what do you say, how many kids did you kill today,” they
also shouted.</p>
<p>Inside the White House’s carefully managed events on Wednesday, the
scene was different. Biden announced $3.3 billion in initiatives aimed
at fixing transportation and infrastructure. He did not, during his
public remarks, mention Gaza or any foreign policy issues.</p>
<p>“Everything we’re doing is connecting people with opportunity, not
disconnecting people from opportunity,” Biden said, speaking at a
community sports center that was shuttered during the pandemic but has
since reopened.</p>
<p>“These projects will increase access to health care, schools, jobs,
and will strengthen communities by covering highways with public spaces,
creating new transit routes, adding sidewalks, bridges, bike lanes and
more,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said to reporters aboard Air
Force One.</p>
<p>The White House referred questions to the campaign when asked if
Biden would meet with any Arab Americans in Wisconsin or Michigan, where
he heads Thursday.</p>
<p>VOA asked Ben Wikler, chairman of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin,
whether Biden had met — or would meet — with any concerned parties about
the situation in Gaza.</p>
<p>“President Biden believes that every person’s life is profoundly
valuable,” he replied. “From Palestine, Israel and around the world.
He’s working to move forward towards a just and peaceful enduring
solution, as he said in the State of the Union address. And that is the
thing that will make the biggest difference for the profound feelings
that people have about this crisis.”</p>
<p>The two main political contenders are taking a very different
approach in this Midwestern state.</p>
<p>Biden said success in a closely contested state like Wisconsin “comes
down to knocking on doors.”</p>
<p>On Wednesday, he lingered inside his new Wisconsin campaign
headquarters — in the largest city, Milwaukee — where he met with
Democratic volunteers behind closed doors for more than an hour.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, supporters of Biden rival Donald Trump this week submitted
petitions in Wisconsin to force a recall election against the state’s
top Republican, who refused calls to decertify Biden’s legitimate,
narrow win in 2020.</p>
<p>When asked if the Biden campaign had faith in the state’s election
process, Wikler was emphatic.</p>
<p>“Wisconsin has consistently been rated as among the best states in
the country when it comes to administering elections,” he said. “That

Here’s a screen shot of the new software that came out today, the
blogroll feature on <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a>.
</p>
<p>
It’s a
<a href="https://www.manton.org/2024/03/13/more-updates-from.html">post</a>
on <a href="https://www.manton.org/">Manton’s blog</a>, viewed in the

2024 &amp; 2023</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-14, from: LLVM Blog</p>
<p>
The LLVM organization was accepted to participate in Google Summer of
Code in 2024. Soon, prospective participants will begin submitting their
project proposals, and mentors will review them to select those who will
spend a significant amount of time this year contributing to various
parts of LLVM.
</p>
<p>
But first, let’s look back and see what we had in 2023. The Google
Summer of Code 2023 was very successful for the LLVM project. Overall,
we received 54 proposals for 24 open projects. Out of this set of
proposals, 20 projects were successfully completed and covered many
different aspects of LLVM and its subprojects.

With a successful end to 2023, the LLVM Project is excited to
participate in GSOC 2024. If you are interested in participating, here
are some guidelines:
</p>
<h3 id="1-project-ideas">
<ol type="1">
<li>Project ideas
</h3>
<p>
Please take a look on list of projects at
<a href="https://llvm.org/OpenProjects.html#gsoc24">Open Projects</a>
page. Projects also have topics below on
<a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/tag/gsoc2024">LLVM Discourse</a>
having #gsoc24 tag, so you can ask mentors about details of the project,
skills required, etc.
</p>
<h3 id="2-way-to-submitting-a-proposal">
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Way to submitting a proposal
</h3>
<p>
We encourage you to discuss your proposal before submitting to GSoC
system. Having your proposal discussed ensures that your proposal will
be well aligned with the project. Please do not hijack other threads
(e.g. with mentor Q&amp;A) and create a separate new thread to discuss
your proposal. The ideal proposal will contain:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A descriptive title
</li>
<li>
Information about you, including contact information. Please do not
forget to include:
<ul>
<li>
Your prior compiler and compiler-related experience, if any
(e.g. studies at the University, prior contributions)
</li>
<li>
Whether you have any prior contributions to LLVM. If yes, please provide
links to these contributions.
</li>
<li>
Your past open source participation and contributions, if any
</li>
<li>
Your knowledge of programming languages (e.g. C, C++, Python, Rust,
etc.) and your estimate of your level of experience
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Information about your proposed project. This should be fairly detailed
and include a timeline.
</li>
<li>
Information about other commitments that might affect your ability to
work during the GSoC period (exams, classes, holidays, other jobs,
weddings, etc.). Also, if the project allows both medium- and large-size
participation, indicate the intended size of the project and the
timeframe of your participation.
</li>
</ul>
