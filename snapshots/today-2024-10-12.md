## Hackers Advertise Stolen Verizon Push-to-Talk ‘Call Logs’

date: 2024-10-12, from: 404 Media Group

The breach does not appear to impact the main consumer Verizon network, and instead involves the company’s push to talk (PTT) product, marketed to public sector agencies and enterprises.

**@Dave Winer's linkblog** (date: 2024-10-12, from: Dave Winer's linkblog)

Why does American television and press “both-sides” our politics?  Why are such different presidential candidates presented as equally flawed?  Why do the outrages of Trump, for example at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, lead to the humiliation of Biden?

Trump&#39;s top general calls former president &quot;fascist&quot; and &quot;dangerous&quot; threat. (Not exactly news, but it’s nice to see one pub report it, even if it is just a quote.)

<p>One of the features of using a custom email address with every service or website is that it's easy to see when information gets sold to third parties. Today's inbox let me know it's time to shut down my Macy's alias, and also that Macy's as a company is in some trouble. </p><p>Selling off customer data for reasons other than partnering or targeted advertisements is a short term cash grab move. Interestingly their stock price isn't showing this despiration yet. If I were a market gambler this might be something I'd try to capitalize on.</p>

## A Brief History of Defragging

date: 2024-10-11, from: Michael Tsai

Howard Oakley: All storage media, including memory, SSDs and rotating hard disks, can develop fragmentation, but most serious attention has been paid to the problem on hard disks. This is because of their electro-mechanical mechanism for seeking to locations on the spinning platter they use for storage. To read a fragmented file sequentially, the read-write [&#8230;]

## Using NSDockTilePlugIn

date: 2024-10-11, from: Michael Tsai

Mario Guzm&#225;n (Mastodon): Customizing an application&#8217;s Dock tile when the application itself is not running requires that you write a plug-in. The plug-in&#8217;s principal class must implement the NSDockTilePlugIn protocol.The name of the plugin is indicated by a NSDockTilePlugIn key in the application&#8217;s Info.plist file.The plugin is loaded in a system process at login time [&#8230;]

## Virtualizing iOS on Apple Silicon

Nick Botticelli (via Hacker News): Now, to get started, a strategy for approaching the daunting task of running iOS on vma2 is needed. I found the most success with reusing a fully macOS 12.0.1 bootchain and simply replacing the system (OS) image, along with its associated mtree, root_hash, and trustcache files, with that of the [&#8230;]

## Introducing Torre, a new way to translate

date: 2024-10-11, from: Peter Warden

I&#8217;m excited to announce Torre, a new product that translates instantly between Spanish and English. A lot of native English speakers I talk to don&#8217;t understand why a better approach to translation is needed, since there have been phone apps around for years. The best way I&#8217;ve found to explain is &#8220;Can you imagine watching [&#8230;]

## Artist Left with Heavy Fees by Copyright Troll Law Firm

date: 2024-10-11, from: Authors Union blogs

The final outcome of the case: the plaintiff was ordered to cover $102,404 in fees and $165.72 in costs for the defendant. This should serve as a cautionary tale for would-be plaintiffs: copyright lawsuits, like any other type of litigation, are primarily meant to address the damages plaintiffs actually suffered, and the final settlement should make plaintiffs whole again—that is, as if no infringement has ever occurred. Copyright lawsuits (or the threat to sue) should not be undertaken as a way to create brand new income streams.

I would switch to any podcatcher that let me edit my subscription list outside their app, because I use that list in different contexts, also because I’d like to share my list with others, also because there are lots of others, aka influencers who’d like to too. You’d own the market if you did this.
