## Harris' doctor reports she's in 'excellent health'

date: 2024-10-12, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is in “excellent health” and “possesses the physical and mental resiliency” required to serve as president, her doctor said in a letter released Saturday that summarizes her medical history and status.


Dr. Joshua Simmons, a U.S. Army colonel and physician to the vice president, wrote that Harris, 59, maintains a healthy, active lifestyle and that her most recent physical, in April, was “unremarkable.”


She “possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief,” he wrote in a two-page letter.


Harris' campaign hopes to use the moment to draw a contrast with Republican Donald Trump, who has released only limited information about his health over the years, and raise questions about his fitness to serve, according to a campaign aide who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.


Trump has released very little health information, including after his ear was grazed by a bullet during an assassination attempt in July.


Simmons, who said he has been Harris’ primary care physician for the past 3½ years, said the vice president has a history of allergies and urticaria, also known as hives, for which she has been on allergen immunotherapy for the past three years.


Simmons said Harris’ latest blood work and other test results were “unremarkable.”


Also in the report: Harris wears contact lenses for mild nearsightedness; her family history includes maternal colon cancer; she is up to date on preventive care recommendations, including having a colonoscopy and annual mammograms.


As Harris' office released the medical report, her campaign highlighted recent media reports raising questions about Trump's health and mental acuity and his failure to provide information about health status and medical history.


Trump, 78, eagerly questioned President Joe Biden's health when the 81-year-old president was seeking reelection. Since Biden was replaced on the ticket with Harris, Trump's own health has drawn more attention.


Last November, Trump marked Biden's birthday by releasing a letter from his physician that reported the former president was in “excellent” physical and mental health.


The letter, posted on Trump’s social media platform, contained no details to support its claims — measures such as weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels, or the results of any test.

## US airstrikes target multiple militant camps in Syria

date: 2024-10-12, from: VOA News USA

BEIRUT — A series of U.S. airstrikes targeted several camps run by the Islamic State group in Syria in an operation the U.S. military said will disrupt the extremists from conducting attacks in the region and beyond.


The U.S. Central Command said the airstrikes were conducted Friday, without specifying in which parts of Syria. About 900 U.S. troops have been deployed in eastern Syria alongside the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces that were instrumental in the fight against IS militants.


Despite their defeat, attacks by IS sleeper cells in Iraq and Syria have been on the rise over the past years, with scores of people killed or wounded.


The Islamic State group seized territory at the height of its power and declared a caliphate in large parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014 but was defeated in Iraq in 2017. In March 2019, the extremists lost the last sliver of land they once controlled in eastern Syria.


The U.S. military said the strikes will disrupt the ability of the Islamic State group to plan, organize and conduct attacks against the United States, its allies and partners, as well as civilians throughout the region and beyond.


It said battle damage assessments were underway and there were no civilian casualties.


Last month, Iraq’s military said that Iraqi forces and American troops killed a senior IS commander who was wanted by the United States, as well as several other prominent militants.


At its peak, the group ruled an area half the size of the United Kingdom where it enforced its extreme interpretation of Islam, which included attacks on religious minority groups and harsh punishment of Muslims deemed to be apostates.

Why does American television and press “both-sides” our politics?  Why are such different presidential candidates presented as equally flawed?  Why do the outrages of Trump, for example at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, lead to the humiliation of Biden?

## Animal lovers try to counter the deadly risk of Chicago high-rises for migrating birds

date: 2024-10-12, from: VOA News USA

chicago — With a neon-green net in hand, Annette Prince briskly walks a downtown Chicago plaza at dawn, looking left and right as she goes.


It's not long before she spots a tiny yellow bird sitting on the concrete. It doesn't fly away, and she quickly nets the bird, gently places it inside a paper bag and labels the bag with the date, time and place.


"This is a Nashville warbler," said Prince, director of the Chicago Bird Collision Monitors, noting that the bird must have flown into a glass window pane of an adjacent building. "He must only weigh about two pennies. He's squinting his eyes because his head hurts."


For rescue groups like the Chicago Bird Collision Monitors, this scene plays out hundreds of times each spring and fall after migrating birds fly into homes, small buildings and sometimes Chicago's skyscrapers and other hulking buildings.


A stark sign of the risks came last fall, when 1,000 migrating birds died on a single night after flying into the glass exterior of the city's lakefront convention center, McCormick Place. This fall, the facility unveiled new bird-safe window film on one of its glass buildings along the Lake Michigan shore.


The $1.2 million project installed tiny dots on the exterior of the Lakeside Center building, adorning enough glass to cover two football fields.


Doug Stotz, senior conservation ecologist at the nearby Field Museum, hopes the project will be a success. He estimated that just 20 birds have died after flying into the convention's center's glass exterior so far this fall, a hopeful sign.


"We don't have a lot of data since this just started this fall, but at this point, it looks like it's made a huge difference," Stotz said.


But for the birds that collide with Chicago buildings, there is a network of people waiting to help. They also are aiming to educate officials and find solutions to improve building design, lighting and other factors in the massive number of bird collision deaths in Chicago and worldwide.


Prince said she and other volunteers walk the streets downtown to document what they can of the birds that are killed and injured.




"We have the combination of the millions of birds that pass through this area because it's a major migratory path through the United States, on top of the amount of artificial lighting that we put out at night, which is when these birds are traveling and getting confused and attracted to the amount of glass," Prince said.


Dead birds are often saved for scientific use, including by Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History. Rescued birds are taken to local wildlife rehabilitation centers to recover, such as the DuPage Wildlife Conservation Center in suburban Illinois.


On a recent morning, veterinarian Darcy Stephenson at DuPage gave a yellow-bellied sapsucker anesthetic gas before taping its wings open for an X-ray. The bird arrived with a note from a rescue group: "Window collision."


Examining the results, she found the bird had a broken ulna — a bone in the wing.


The center takes in about 10,000 species of animals annually and 65% of them are avian. Many are victims of window collisions and during peak migration in the fall, several hundred birds can show up in one day.


"The large chunk of these birds do actually survive and make it back into the wild once we're able to treat them," said Sarah Reich, head veterinarian at DuPage. "Fractures heal very, very quickly in these guys for shoulder fractures. Soft tissue trauma generally heals pretty well. The challenging cases are going to be the ones where the trauma isn't as apparent."


Injured birds go through a process of flight testing, then get a full physical exam by the veterinary staff and are rehabilitated before being set free.


"It's exciting to be able to get these guys back out into the wild, especially some of those cases that we're kind of cautiously optimistic about or maybe have an injury that we've never treated successfully before," Reich said, adding that these are the cases "clinic staff get really, really excited about."

## Louisiana's Cajun and Creole heritage will be celebrated at 50th annual festival

date: 2024-10-12, from: VOA News USA

new orleans, louisiana — Louisiana's Cajun and Creole heritage takes center stage this weekend when the Festivals Acadiens et Creoles marks a half-century of honoring and celebrating the culture through music, arts, food and community. 


What started as a one day concert in 1974 to entertain 150 French-speaking journalists gathered in Lafayette — considered the heart of Cajun country — has grown into a three-day event and possibly one of the largest Cajun and Zydeco festivals in the world, organizers said. And, they note, the entire event is free. 


Barry Jean Ancelet, one of the event's organizers, said when the idea formed 50 years ago, nobody knew if anyone would even come to hear the music. 


"Cajun music at that time was largely considered 'old people's music,'" he said. "You've got to remember, we were in the throes of Rock 'n' Roll at the time. The people here loved it when they encountered it in dance halls, but this concert was designed to call attention to the music in a different way, to point out its value. They had to sit — not dance — and pay attention. And they ended up hearing it in a different way. It was so successful. We ended up turning it into an annual event where we could call positive attention to this important asset and get people to consider it." 




The festival, now held annually in Lafayette's Girard Park, brings together multi-generations of musicians and artists who annually fight to preserve a culture that continues to evolve. 


"We've always been about celebrating the past and handing it off to the future," Ancelet said. "If you value and respect evolution, the culture will produce things that will continue to surprise you. It all comes out in the wash. What's good will last and what's not, won't." 


Festival co-founder Pat Mould said the festival is a "self-celebration of who we are, how we live, what we eat, the music and how we speak." 


"If you know nothing and want to learn about the culture, this one weekend out of the year allows you to find out everything. Everything you want to know is represented at the festival. It's a quick study of Cajun and Creole living," he said. 


Event features homegrown talent


On tap musically for the Friday through Sunday event are performances by 60 musicians — all homegrown talent — including Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys, Wayne Toups, CJ Chenier, Nathan and the Zydeco Cha Chas, Chubby Carrier and the Bayou Swamp Band, The Revelers, Beausoleil avec Michael Doucet and The Lost Bayou Ramblers. 


On Friday, contemporary artists will pay tribute to the 1974 concert house band that included Zydeco pioneer Clifton Chenier, Cajun accordion maker Marc Savoy, the Balfa Brothers, a Cajun music ensemble of five brothers, Cajun accordion players Nathan Abshire and Blackie Forrester, and Jimmy C. Newman, a country music and Cajun singer-songwriter and long-time star of the Grand Ole Opry. 


"Get ready for Louisiana pure fun," said Carrier, who's scheduled to perform with his band on Sunday. "Get ready to eat some really good food and have the time of your life." 


"People all over the word have these dates circled on their calendar," he continued. "It's an event that helps the younger generations continue the traditions. I'm a third generation Zydeco musician. This is a family oriented festival that brings people together of all ages." 


A 'celebration of everything Cajun'


Riley, who's been performing at this festival since 1988, said he keeps returning for several reasons but especially because it helps preserve the culture. 


"It's important to see us on stage, singing and speaking in French. That has an effect on people who come to see us and helps them fall in love with the culture," he said. 


"There are a lot of events leading up to the weekend that focuses on the importance of the language, the culture, the food and, of course, the music. There's none other that celebrates it like this one. I think it's the biggest complete celebration of everything Cajun. It's also inclusive of different generations, bands with lineage. That's key," he said. 


Riley, now 55, said he's very proud that his three children play music. 


"It's a beautiful thing for my family and others like mine," he said. "Having your kids play with you is awesome. Most kids don't want to have anything to do with what their parents do. Mine think what I do is fun and it is." 


Riley said when he first started there weren't too many young bands playing Cajun music. 


"There was real fear that the music would die off and dissipate like the language," he said. "The opposite has happened. More young folks are preserving and playing this music than ever. The Zydeco scene down here is packed with young people. It's super vibrant and alive. The same with the Cajun scene as well."

## Nazi-looted Monet artwork returned to family generations later

date: 2024-10-12, from: VOA News USA

NEW ORLEANS — On the eve of World War II, Nazis in Austria seized a pastel by renowned impressionist artist Claude Monet, selling it off and sparking a family's decadeslong search that culminated Wednesday in New Orleans.


At an FBI field office, agents lifted a blue veil covering the Monet pastel and presented Adalbert Parlagi's granddaughters with the artwork over 80 years after it was taken from their family. Helen Lowe said she felt that her grandfather would be watching and that he would be "so, so proud of this moment."


Monet's 1865 Bord de Mer depicts rocks along the shoreline of the Normandy coast, where Allied forces stormed the beaches of Nazi-occupied France during D-Day in 1944, marking a turning point in the war. The Monet pastel is one of 20,000 items recovered by the FBI Art Crime Team out of an estimated 600,000 artworks and millions of books and religious objects stolen by the Nazis.


"The theft was not random or incidental, but an integral part of the Nazis' plan to eliminate all vestiges of Jewish life in Germany and Europe, root and branch," U.S. State Department Holocaust adviser Stuart E. Eizenstat said in a March speech.


After Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938, Adalbert Parlagi, a successful businessman and art lover, and his wife, Hilda, left behind almost everything they owned and fled Vienna, using British license plates to drive across the border, their granddaughters said. Though the Parlagis hadn't identified as Jewish for years and baptized their children as Protestants, they were still considered Jewish under Nazi laws, according to Austrian government records. Other relatives were killed in concentration camps.


The Parlagis attempted to ship their valuable carpets, porcelain and artworks out of Vienna to London, but found out later that their property had been seized and auctioned off by the Gestapo to support the Third Reich.


Multiple international declarations decried trading in Nazi-looted art, beginning with Allied forces in London in 1943. The 1998 Washington principles, signed by more than three dozen countries, reiterated the call and advocated for the return of stolen art.


Yet Adalbert Parlagi's efforts were stonewalled by the Vienna auctioneer who had bought and sold the Monet pastel and another artwork owned by Parlagi. The records were lost after the fighting in Vienna, the auctioneer told Adalbert in a letter shortly after World War II, according to an English translation of a document prepared by an Austrian government body reviewing the Parlagi family's art restitution claims.


"I also cannot remember two such pictures either," the auctioneer said.




Many survivors of World War II and their descendants ultimately give up trying to recover their lost artwork because of the difficulties they face, said Anne Webber, co-founder of the London-based nonprofit Commission for Looted Art in Europe, which has recovered more than 3,500 looted artworks.


"You have to just constantly, constantly, constantly look," Webber said.


Adalbert Parlagi and his son Franz kept meticulous ownership and search records. After Franz's death in 2012, Françoise Parlagi stumbled upon her father's cache of documents, including the original receipt from her grandfather's purchase of the Monet pastel. She reached out to Webber's commission for help in 2014.


The commission's research team reviewed archives and receipts, contacted museums and art experts and scoured the internet, but initially found "absolutely no trace," Webber said. Then, in 2021, the team discovered online that a New Orleans dealer acquired the Monet in 2017 and sold it to a Louisiana-based doctor and his wife.


The FBI investigated the commission's research and, earlier this year, a federal court ruled the pastel should be returned to the Parlagis' descendants.


"There was never a question" of returning the art to the rightful owners after learning of its sordid history, said Bridget Vita-Schlamp, whose late husband had purchased the Monet pastel.


"We were shocked, I'm not going to lie," she said.


The family recovered another work in March from the Austrian government but there are still six more artworks missing, including from acclaimed artists Camille Pissarro and Paul Signac. The U.S. is likely the "largest illegal art market in the world," said Kristin Koch, supervisory special agent with the FBI's Art Crime Program.


The art world has a greater responsibility to investigate the origins of artworks and a moral obligation to return looted works to their rightful owners, Webber said.


"They represent the life and the lives that were taken," Webber said. "They represent the world that they were exiled from."


The granddaughters of Adalbert and Hilda Parlagi say they are grateful for what they have already gotten back. Françoise Parlagi, a broad smile on her face, said she hoped to hang a copy of the pastel in her home. She said the moment felt "unreal."


"So many families are in this situation. Maybe they haven't even been trying to recover because they don't believe, they think this might not be possible," she said. "Let us be hope for other families."

## What makes a storm a hurricane? The dangers across 5 categories

## US voting systems, targets of conspiracy theories, get tested for accuracy, security

date: 2024-10-12, from: VOA News USA

ATLANTA — Voting machines have been at the center of a web of conspiracy theories after the 2020 U.S. election, with false claims that they were manipulated to steal the presidency from Donald Trump.


There was no evidence of widespread fraud or rigged voting machines in the election, and multiple reviews in the battleground states where the Republican president disputed his loss to Democrat Joe Biden confirmed the results as accurate. In 2023, Fox News agreed to pay Dominion Voting Systems, one of the largest voting machine companies, $787 million to avoid a trial in a defamation lawsuit.


In the years since his loss, Trump and his allies have continued to sow doubts about voting equipment. State and local election officials have tried to push back by explaining the layers of protection that surround voting systems and the measures they have in place to conduct fair and accurate elections.


In November's presidential election, nearly every ballot cast will have a paper record that can be used to obtain an accurate count even if there are errors or cyberattacks.


What is a voting machine?


Election officials rely on various pieces of technology. Every office does things a little bit differently.


Officials rely on a voter registration system that is a database of registered voters and have an election management system that workers use to create, issue and track ballots. They also use an election-night reporting system that reports unofficial results. Many jurisdictions use electronic pollbooks to check in voters at polling locations.


All this depends on software and computers, a reliance that carries risks that officials work to identify and address. For example, election officials often will isolate critical systems from the internet and use storage devices, such as secured USB sticks, to transfer data. They limit access to sensitive equipment to only those who need it and have logs that track and monitor the devices.


When an internet connection is needed, election officials will often use private networks to limit the risk of malicious activity and take other steps to scan their systems for potential vulnerabilities and threats.


Voters in much of the country fill out ballots by hand, and then that ballot will be scanned and counted electronically. A few places, mostly small towns in the Northeast, will count their ballots by hand.


In some areas, voters use a computer to mark their ballots electronically and then get a printout of their choices that they insert into a scanner for counting. In other cases, the ballot is cast electronically, and a paper record is printed that summarizes the votes cast. That record is then available if a hand count is needed.


Are voting machines connected to the internet?


With a few exceptions, no. There are some jurisdictions in a few states that allow for ballot scanners in polling locations to transmit unofficial results, using a mobile private network, after voting has ended on Election Day and the memory cards containing the vote tallies have been removed.


Election officials who allow this say it provides for faster reporting of unofficial election results on election night. They say the paper records of the ballots cast are used to authenticate the results during postelection reviews, and that those records would be crucial to a recount if one was needed.


Computer security experts have said this is an unnecessary risk and should be prohibited.


Are voting machines secure?


Election officials say they have worked extensively to shore up security around their voting equipment after an effort by Russia to scan state voter registration systems for vulnerabilities in 2016.


There was no evidence then that any data was changed or deleted, but it led the federal government to declare the nation's election systems as critical infrastructure. That allows the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to provide free cybersecurity reviews and vulnerability testing to election offices nationwide.




"Today, eight years later, because of all the incredible work by election officials to strengthen the security and resiliency of our election process, election infrastructure has never been more secure, and the election stakeholder community has never been stronger," the agency's director, Jen Easterly, told reporters in September.


Computer security experts have called for more to be done and for election officials to limit the use of certain technology, specifically machines that mark ballots for voters. A long-running court battle in Georgia has sought to compel the state to get rid of these machines in favor of hand-marked paper ballots.


Experts have also raised particular concern about a series of security breaches that occurred after the 2020 election as Trump allies sought access to voting systems in Georgia and elsewhere as they tried to prove their unsubstantiated claims. The experts have warned that the public release of critical election software because of the breaches has raised "serious threats" and have called for a federal investigation.


How do election officials ensure accuracy?


Election officials say there are safeguards in place to ensure that voting systems are not manipulated. That begins with physical security, such as locked rooms with limited access and the use of tamper-evident seals. In addition, voting equipment is tested before the election, a process that includes running test ballots through the equipment to ensure votes are being counted correctly.


Postelection reviews are conducted to identify any mistakes or errors that may have occurred.


Around 98% of all ballots cast in this year's election will include a paper record, according to a report by the Brennan Center for Justice based on data collected by Verified Voting, a nonpartisan group that tracks voting equipment in the U.S. Officials say that's important for ensuring that any error or cyberattack will not prevent officials from producing an accurate record of the vote.

## Florida residents slog through aftermath of Hurricane Milton

date: 2024-10-12, from: VOA News USA

LITHIA, Florida — Florida residents slogged through flooded streets, gathered up scattered debris and assessed damage to their homes on Friday after Hurricane Milton smashed through coastal communities and spawned a barrage of deadly tornadoes.


At least 10 people were dead, and rescuers were still saving people from swollen rivers, but many expressed relief that Milton wasn't worse. The hurricane spared densely populated Tampa a direct hit, and the lethal storm surge that scientists feared never materialized.


Gov. Ron DeSantis warned people to not let down their guard, however, citing ongoing safety threats including downed power lines and standing water that could hide dangerous objects.


"We're now in the period where you have fatalities that are preventable," DeSantis said. "You have to make the proper decisions and know that there are hazards out there."


As of Friday night, the number of customers in Florida still without power had dropped to 1.9 million, according to poweroutage.us. St. Petersburg's 260,000 residents were told to boil water before drinking, cooking or brushing their teeth, until at least Monday.


Also Friday, the owner of a major phosphate mine disclosed that pollution spilled into Tampa Bay during the hurricane.


The Mosaic Company said in a statement that heavy rains from the storm overwhelmed a collection system at its Riverview site, pushing excess water out of a manhole and into discharges that lead to the bay. The company said the leak was fixed Thursday.


Mosaic said the spill likely exceeded a 66,245-liter minimum reporting standard, though it did not provide a figure for what the total volume might have been.


Calls and emails to Mosaic seeking additional information about Riverview and the company's other Florida mines received no response, as did a voicemail left with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.


The state has 25 such stacks containing more than 1 billion tons of phosphogypsum, a solid waste byproduct of the phosphate fertilizer mining industry that contains radium, which decays to form radon gas. Both radium and radon are radioactive and can cause cancer. Phosphogypsum may also contain toxic heavy metals and other carcinogens, such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury and nickel.


Florida's vital tourism industry has started to return to normal, meanwhile, as Walt Disney World and other theme parks reopened. The state's busiest airport, in Orlando, resumed full operations Friday.




Arriving just two weeks after the devastating Hurricane Helene, Milton flooded barrier islands, tore the roof off the Tampa Bay Rays ' baseball stadium and toppled a construction crane.


Crews from the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office on Friday were assisting with rescues of people, including a 92-year-old woman, who were stranded in rising waters along the Alafia River. The river is 40 kilometers long and runs from eastern Hillsborough County, east of Tampa, into Tampa Bay.


In Pinellas County, deputies used high-water vehicles to shuttle people back and forth to their homes in a flooded Palm Harbor neighborhood where waters continued to rise.


Ashley Cabrera left with her 18- and 11-year-old sons and their three dogs, Eeyore, Poe and Molly. It was the first time since Milton struck that they had been able to leave the neighborhood, and they were now headed to a hotel in Orlando.


"I'm extremely thankful that we could get out now and go for the weekend somewhere we can get a hot meal and some gas," Cabrera said. "I thought we'd be able to get out as soon as the storm was over. These roads have never flooded like this in all the years that I've lived here."


Animals were being saved, too. Cindy Evers helped rescue a large pig stuck in high water at a strip mall in Lithia, east of Tampa. She had already rescued a donkey and several goats after the storm.


"I'm high and dry where I'm at, and I have a barn and 9 acres (3.6 hectares)," Evers said, adding that she will soon start to work to find the animals' owners.


In the Gulf Coast city of Venice, Milton left behind dozens of centimeters of sand in some beachfront condos, with one unit nearly filled. A swimming pool was packed full of sand, with only its handrails poking out.


Some warnings were heeded and lessons learned. When 2.4 meters of seawater flooded Punta Gorda during Hurricane Helene last month, 121 people had to be rescued, Mayor Lynne Matthews said. Milton brought at least 1.5 meters of flooding, but rescuers only had to save three people.


"So people listened to the evacuation order," Matthews said.


Heaps of fruit were scattered across the ground and trees toppled over after both Milton and Hurricane Helene swept through Polk County and other orange-growing regions, Matt Joyner of trade group Florida Citrus Mutual said Friday.


Milton arrived at the start of the orange growing season, so it is still too early to evaluate the full scope of the damage.


Florida has already seen orange production diminish over the years, with the industry still recovering from hurricanes of years past while also waging an ongoing battle against a deadly greening disease. Milton could be the knockout punch for some growers, Joyce said.


In the western coastal city of Clearwater, Kelvin Glenn said it took less than an hour early Thursday for water to rise to his waist inside his apartment. He and seven children, ranging in age from 3 to 16, were trapped in the brown, foul floodwaters for about three hours before an upstairs neighbor opened their home to them.


Later that day, first responders arrived in boats to ferry them away from the building.


"Sitting in that cold, nasty water was kind of bad," Glenn said.


Short-term survival is now turning into long-term worries. A hotel is $160 a night. Everything inside Glenn's apartment is gone. And it can take time to get assistance.


"I ain't going to say we're homeless," Glenn said. "But we've got to start all over again."


The Federal Emergency Management Agency has enough money to deal with the immediate needs of people impacted by Helene and Milton but will need additional funding at some point, FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell said Friday.


The disaster assistance fund helps pay for the swift response to hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and other disasters. Congress recently replenished the fund with $20 billion — the same amount as last year.

## Meta removes fake accounts in Moldova ahead of presidential election

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

STOCKHOLM — Meta Platforms said on Friday that it had removed a network of group accounts targeting Russian speakers in Moldova ahead of the country's October 20 election, for violation of the company's policy on fake accounts.


Authorities in Moldova, an ex-Soviet state lying between Romania and Ukraine, said they had blocked dozens of Telegram channels and chat bots linked to a drive to pay voters to cast "no" ballots in a referendum on European Union membership held alongside the presidential election.


Pro-European President Maia Sandu is seeking a second term in the election and called the referendum on joining the 27-member bloc as the cornerstone of her policies.


The fake Meta accounts posted criticism of Sandu, pro-EU politicians and close ties between Moldova and Romania, and supported pro-Russia parties in Moldova, the company said.


The company said its operation centered on about a dozen fictitious, Russian-language news brands posing as independent entities with presence on multiple internet services, including Meta-owned Facebook and Instagram, as well as Telegram, OK.ru and TikTok.


Meta said it removed seven Facebook accounts, 23 pages, one group and 20 accounts on Instagram for violating its "coordinated inauthentic behavior policy."


About 4,200 accounts followed one or more of the 23 pages and about 335,000 accounts followed one or more of the Instagram accounts, Meta said.


In Chisinau, the National Investigation Inspectorate said it had blocked 15 channels of the popular Telegram messaging app and 95 chat bots offering voters money. Users were told the channels "violated local laws" on political party financing.


It had traced the accounts to supporters of fugitive businessman Ilan Shor — members of the banned party bearing his name or the "Victory" electoral bloc he had set up in its place from his base of exile in Moscow.


Moldovan police said on Thursday that they searched homes of leaders linked to Shor as part of a criminal investigation into election-meddling. Police have said tens of thousands of voters were paid off via accounts in a Russian bank to derail the vote.


Shor was sentenced to 15 years in jail in absentia last year in connection with the 2014 disappearance of $1 billion from Moldovan banks. He denies allegations of trying to bribe voters.


Sandu accuses Moscow of trying to topple her government while Moscow has accused her of fomenting "Russophobia."

## US sues Virginia over alleged violation of federal election law

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

washington  — The U.S. Department of Justice said Friday that it had sued the state of Virginia for violating the federal prohibition on systematic efforts to remove voters within 90 days of an election.


On August 7, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin signed an executive order requiring the commissioner of the Department of Elections to certify that the department was conducting "daily updates to the voter list" to remove, among other groups, people who are unable to verify that they are citizens to the Department of Motor Vehicles.


U.S. citizens who were identified and notified and did not affirm their citizenship within 14 days would be removed from the list of registered voters, the Justice Department said. It said this practice has led to citizens having their voter registrations canceled ahead of the November 5 election.


"By canceling voter registrations within 90 days of Election Day, Virginia places qualified voters in jeopardy of being removed from the rolls and creates the risk of confusion for the electorate," said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke.


"Congress adopted the National Voter Registration Act’s quiet period restriction to prevent error-prone, eleventh-hour efforts that all too often disenfranchise qualified voters," Clarke added.


The department said it was seeking injunctive relief that would restore the ability of affected eligible voters to cast their votes unimpeded on Election Day and would prohibit future violations.


Youngkin called the move politically motivated and an attempt to interfere in the election.


"With the support of our attorney general, we will defend these common sense steps that we are legally required to take with every resource available to us," he said in a statement on Friday.


Republicans across the U.S. have pushed against noncitizen voting, which is already illegal, ahead of the November election. Some election officials have warned that the move could penalize eligible voters.

## Experts: Future of US-South Korea defense cost-sharing deal remains uncertain

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

washington  — U.S. national security experts say it is unclear whether a new cost-sharing agreement with South Korea, hailed by the State Department as “a significant accomplishment,” will survive if former President Donald Trump returns to the White House next year.


Concluded last week and effective from 2026, the five-year Special Measures Agreement, or SMA, requires South Korea to raise its contribution to the cost of stationing of U.S. troops in the country by 8.3% to $1.47 billion in the first year.


The two allies reached the agreement earlier than expected, a move widely seen as key for Seoul and Washington to clinch before the U.S. presidential election in November, in which Trump is the Republican Party candidate.


The U.S. State Department hailed the agreement as a “a significant accomplishment for both sides” in a statement released on October 4.


But Trump, both in office and as a candidate, has consistently demanded that South Korea contribute significantly more to the cost of supporting U.S. forces in Korea. Most recently in April, Trump told Time magazine that “I want South Korea to treat us properly,” adding that Seoul is “paying virtually nothing for” the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea.


‘Trump factor’


John Bolton, a former White House national security adviser during the Trump administration, told VOA Korean by phone on Friday that “it’s very likely that Trump would ask to renegotiate it.”


“I know that the administration [of President Joe Biden] here tried to rush the coming-to-an-agreement on it, so that Trump couldn’t meddle with it, but that won’t slow him down at all,” said Bolton, who also served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in 2005-06.


“He never thinks his predecessors make good enough deals, and in part, it’s not just the question of economics, but he doesn’t understand collective defense alliances,” Bolton said.


“He thinks that not just with respect to the Republic of Korea, but also with NATO or Japan or whatever that we’re defending, these countries don’t pay us enough money.” The Republic of Korea is South Korea’s formal name.


Bruce Klingner, the senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation, pointed out the pact is “an executive agreement,” which makes it easier for Trump to undo since it does not require approval from Congress.


“We really don’t know whether he would just see it as a done deal, or if he will seek to renegotiate it upward, where South Korea would pay much more,” Klingner said.


“If you take a step back, it’s in our strategic interest to have allies, it’s in our strategic interest to have our forces stationed overseas, because actually, they’re less costly to the United States when they’re stationed overseas than when they’re stationed domestically.”


Robert Rapson, who served as charge d'affaires and deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, told VOA Korean last week that he was concerned that the agreement wouldn't pass muster with a Trump administration should the former president win a second term in November.


“Given his demands and expectations of U.S. allies with respect to security burden sharing, my strong fear is that he will seek to renegotiate today’s agreement with a much higher number in mind,” said Rapson, who was directly involved in the two sets of SMA negotiations in 2013-14 and in 2019-21.


Evans Revere, who served as acting U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, told VOA Korean on Thursday via email that he suspected there was “considerable dissatisfaction with the recently concluded SMA agreement in the Trump camp,” knowing how strongly the former president feels about the burden-sharing issue.


Revere said he could not rule out the possibility that Trump will come up with “a demand to reopen talks on the SMA issue, and toward that end, he might make major new demands of Seoul” if he takes office again.


'It's in our interest'


Other former government officials, like Klingner, believe it is too early to predict whether Trump will try to revise the cost-sharing agreement between the U.S. and South Korea.


Richard Armitage, who served as deputy secretary of state during the George W. Bush administration, told VOA Korean on Wednesday on the phone, “He might try, but let’s not get fearful about this too soon.”


“If he comes to the White House, he will have a secretary of state, defense, national security adviser, et cetera, who may have slightly different views and can help moderate Mr. Trump.”


“Seoul and Washington understand that Trump is very transactional,” Armitage said. “But American soldiers are not Hessians. We’re not for rent. We’re in Korea because it’s in our interest.”


VOA Korean contacted the Trump campaign this week and asked what Trump’s stance was on the newly reached agreement, but did not receive a reply by the time this article was published.

## US soldier sentenced to 14 years in prison for trying to assist Islamic State

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

washington — A U.S. Army soldier was sentenced to 14 years in prison for attempting to help the Islamic State conduct a deadly ambush of U.S. troops, the Department of Justice said on Friday.


Cole Bridges, also known as Cole Gonzales, 24, will undergo supervised release for 10 years following his release from prison, the department said.


Bridges, who was a private first class at the time of his arrest, was charged in 2021 with giving "military advice and guidance on how to kill fellow soldiers to individuals he thought were part of ISIS," the department said.


Bridges pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in June 2023. He joined the Army in 2019.


Before joining, according to the department, he began researching and consuming online propaganda "promoting jihadists and their violent ideology, and began to express his support for ISIS and jihad on social media."

## Boeing lawyers argue for settlement opposed by relatives of those killed in 737 Max crashes

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

fort worth, Texas — Relatives of passengers who died in two crashes of Boeing 737 Max planes came to a federal court in Texas on Friday to listen as their lawyers asked a judge to throw out a plea agreement that the aircraft manufacturer struck with prosecutors and put the company on trial.


Their lawyers argued that Boeing's punishment — mainly a fine amounting to about $244 million — would be too light for misleading regulators about a flight-control system that malfunctioned before the crashes. They accused Boeing and the Justice Department of airbrushing facts and ignoring that 346 people died in the crashes.


U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor asked a Boeing lawyer why he should accept the prepackaged plea deal and a sentence negotiated by a defendant.


The Boeing lawyer, Ben Hatch, said Boeing "is a pillar of the national economy and the national defense” and needs to know the punishment before it agrees to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud, a felony. Otherwise, he said, the company could be disbarred from federal contracting.


“All the employees of the company, the shareholders of the company and a global and national supply chain ... all of those are put into doubt if the sentencing" isn't known, possibly for months, Hatch said.


The answer stunned and angered relatives of the victims.


“Boeing is too important for the economy — they're too big to jail. That's what he's saying,” Michael Stumo, whose daughter Samya died in the second crash, said after the hearing. “It allows them to kill people with no consequences because they're too big and because their shareholders won't like it.”


The government joined Boeing in asking the judge to accept the deal that they struck in July.


Sean Tonolli, senior deputy chief of the Justice Department's fraud section, said the conspiracy count is the most serious crime prosecutors can bring — they can't prove that Boeing's deception of regulators caused the crashes. And, he said, going to trial is risky.


“We are confident in our case, but we don’t take for granted that we might not win," he said.


The judge, who had received written arguments from all sides before the hearing in Fort Worth, asked questions but gave no indication if he is leaning one way or the other. He has expressed sympathy for the passengers' families before, writing in a 2023 ruling about "Boeing’s egregious criminal conduct.”


“You have given me a lot to think about,” O'Connor said to all the lawyers as Friday's hearing ended. “I'll get a ruling out just as soon as I can.”


In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a single felony count of conspiracy to commit fraud for allegedly deceiving Federal Aviation Administration regulators who were writing pilot-training requirements for the Max.


The FAA approved minimal, computer-based training for Boeing 737 pilots before they could fly the Max, the latest version of the 737. That helped Boeing by avoiding the need for training in flight simulators, which would have raised the cost for airlines to operate the Max.


Airlines began flying the Max in 2017. The first crash occurred in Indonesia in October 2018, followed in March 2019 by the second, in Ethiopia.


The plea agreement calls for Boeing to pay a fine of up to $487.2 million, but the fine would be cut in half by giving the company credit for $243.6 million it paid as part of a $2.5 billion settlement in 2021 to avoid prosecution. The Justice Department decided in May that Boeing violated terms of that settlement, leading to the new plea deal.


Boeing, which is based in Arlington, Virginia, would also invest $455 million in compliance and safety programs, and be placed on probation for three years.


The case is among a host of issues with which the manufacturer most contend.


Talks broke down this week with striking factory workers who assemble some of the company’s best-selling planes. The company withdrew its offer and S&P Global Ratings put it on its credit watch list, citing increased financial risk because of the labor unrest.


On Thursday, the company filed a complaint over what it calls unfair labor practices against the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Boeing in its complaint with the National Labor Relations Board said that the union’s public narrative is misleading and has made it difficult to reach a resolution.

## US expands sanctions against Iran's oil industry after attack on Israel

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

washington — The United States hit Iran's oil and petrochemicals sectors with fresh sanctions Friday in response to Tehran's October 1 attack against Israel, designating dozens of new companies and firms.  


In a statement Friday, the Treasury Department said it was going after Iran's so-called "shadow fleet" of ships involved in selling Iranian oil in circumvention of existing sanctions, designating 10 companies and 17 vessels as "blocked property" over their involvement in "shipments of Iranian petroleum and petrochemical products." 


The State Department announced it was sanctioning an additional six firms and six ships for "knowingly engaging in a significant transaction for the purchase, acquisition, sale, transport, or marketing of petroleum or petroleum products from Iran." 


The sanctions form part of the U.S. response to Iran's attack, in which it launched some 200 ballistic missiles against Israel in retaliation for the killing of Tehran-backed militant leaders and a general from Iran's Revolutionary Guards. 


Israel has said its response to Iran's second direct attack against its territory this year would be "deadly, precise, and surprising." 


U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters last week that Israel should consider "other alternatives than striking oil fields," amid reports it was planning to do so.  


"In response to Iran's attack on Israel, the United States is taking decisive action to further disrupt the Iranian regime's ability to fund and carry out its destabilizing activity," Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. 


"Today's sanctions target Iranian efforts to channel revenues from its energy industry to finance deadly and disruptive activity — including development of its nuclear program, the proliferation of ballistic missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles," she added.  


Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington had made clear after the October 1 attack that Tehran would face consequences. 


"To that end, we are taking steps today to disrupt the flow of revenue the Iranian regime uses to fund its nuclear program and missile development, support terrorist proxies and partners, and perpetuate conflict throughout the Middle East," he said in a statement.

<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgwNTYzNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4OTk4Mjk2M30.kuVlX3L_fl1HJr5V87YQw1GAt-KaSOW4MQ_WIl7l2rQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">As the southeastern U.S. recovers from hurricanes Helene and Milton, the destruction the storms have left behind serves to underline the obvious: The need for technologies that support climate change adaptation and resilience is both real and urgent. And while nearly all the money in climate finance still flows into mitigation tech, which seeks to lower emissions to alleviate tomorrow’s harm, at long last, there are signs that interest and funding for the adaptation space is picking up. </p>
<p>The emergence and success of climate resilience advisory and investment firms such as Tailwind Climate and The Lightsmith Group are two signs of this shift. Founded just last year, Tailwind recently published <a href="https://www.tailwindclimate.com/taxonomy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a taxonomy</u></a> of activities and financing across the various sectors of adaptation and resilience solutions to help clients understand opportunity areas in the space. Next year, the firm’s co-founder Katie MacDonald told me, Tailwind will likely begin raising its first fund. It’s already invested in one company, UK-based <a href="https://www.cryogenx.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Cryogenx</u></a>, which makes a portable cooling vest to rapidly reduce the temperature of patients experiencing heatstroke.</p>
<p>As for Lightsmith, the firm held the final close of its <a href="https://lightsmithgp.com/news-posts/lightsmith-group-closes-inaugural-186-million-growth-equity-climate-fund-the-first-to-focus-on-climate-resilience-and-adaptation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$186 million growth equity fund</u></a> for climate adaptation solutions in 2022, which co-founder and managing director Jay Koh told me is one of the first, if not <em><em>the</em></em> first fund with a climate resilience focus. As Koh sees it, the evolution of climate adaptation and resilience technologies can be broken up into three stages, the first being “reactive and incremental.” That’s largely where we’re at right now, he said — think rebuilding a dam higher after it’s been breached in a flood, or making a firebreak broader after a destructive wildfire. Where he’s seeing interesting companies emerge, though, is in the more proactive second stage, which often involves anticipating and preparing for extreme weather events. “Let’s do a lot more data and analytics ahead of time. Let’s deploy more weather satellites. Let’s look at <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/ai-fire-prevention" target="_self"><u>deploying artificial intelligence</u></a> and other technologies <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/brightband-ai-weather-forecasts" target="_self"><u>to do better forecasting</u></a>,” Koh explained to me. </p>
<p>The third and final stage, he said, could be categorized as “systemic or transcendent adaptation,” which involves systems-level changes as opposed to incremental improvements. Source Global, one of Lightsmith’s portfolio companies which makes solar-powered hydropanels that produce affordable drinking water, is an example of this. As Koh told me, “It’s not simply improving the efficiency of desalination filters by 5% or 10%. It’s saying, listen, we’re going to pull water out of the air in a way that we have never done before.”</p>
<p>But while the activity and interest around adaptation tech may be growing, the money just isn’t there yet. “We’re easily $50 [billion] to $60 billion below where we need to be today,” MacDonald told me. “And you know, we’re on the order of around $150 [billion] to $160 billion below where we need to be by 2030.” Everyone else I spoke with echoed the sentiment. “The latest statistics are that less than 5% of total climate finance tracked on planet Earth is attributable to adaptation and climate resilience,” Koh said. “Of that, less than 2% is private investment.”</p>
<p>There’s a few reasons why early-stage investors especially may be hesitant to throw their weight behind adaptation tech despite the clear need in the market. Amy Francetic, co-founder and managing general partner at Buoyant Ventures, which focuses on early-stage digital solutions for climate risk, told me that the main customer for adaptation solutions is often a government entity. “Municipalities and other government contracts, they’re hard to win, they’re slow to win, and they don’t pay that much, either, which is the problem.” Francetic told me. “So it’s not a great customer to have.”</p>
<p>One of Buoyant’s portfolio companies, the now defunct StormSensor, reinforced this lesson for Francetic. The company used sensors to track water flow within storm and sewage systems to prevent flooding and was able to arrange pilot projects with plenty of water agencies — but few of them converted into paying contracts. “The municipalities were willing to spend money on an experiment, but not so many of them had a larger budget.” Francetic told me. The same dynamic, she said, is also at play in the utility industry, where you often hear about new tech succumbing to “death by pilot.”</p>
<p>It’s not all doom and gloom, though, when it comes to working with larger, risk-averse agencies. AiDash, another of Lightsmith’s portfolio companies that uses artificial intelligence to help utilities assess and address wildfire risk, has five utility partnerships, and earlier this year <a href="https://www.aidash.com/news/aidash-closes-its-oversubscribed-series-c-funding-round-at-58-5-million/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>raised $58.5 million</u></a> in an oversubscribed Series C round. Francetic and MacDonald both told me they’re seeing the conversation around climate adaptation evolve to include more industry stakeholders. In the past, Francetic said, discussing resilience and adaptation was almost seen as a form of climate doomerism. “They said, oh, why are you doing that? It shows that you’re giving up.” But now, MacDonald told me that her experience at this year’s climate week in New York was defined by productive conversations with representatives from the insurance industry, banking sector, and venture capital arena about injecting more capital into the space. </p>
<p>Bill Clerico, the founder and managing partner of the venture firm Convective Capital, is also deeply familiar with the tricky dynamics of climate adaptation funding. Convective, founded in 2022, is solely dedicated to <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/ai-fire-prevention" target="_self"><u>wildfire tech</u></a> solutions. The firm’s portfolio companies span a range of technologies that address suppression, early identification, prevention, and insurance against damages, and are mainly looking to work with utilities, governments, and insurance companies. When I talked to Clerico back in August, he (understatedly) categorized these establishments as “not necessarily the most fast-moving or innovative.” But the bleak silver lining, he told me, is that extreme weather is forcing them to up their tempo. “There is so much destruction happening so frequently that it’s forcing a lot of these institutions to think about it totally differently and to embrace newer, more novel solutions — and to do it quickly.” </p>
<p>People, it seems, are starting to get real. But investors and startups alike are also just beginning to define exactly what adaptation tech encompasses and what metrics for success look like when they’re less measurable than, say, the tons of carbon sucked out of the atmosphere via direct air capture, or the amount of energy produced by a fusion reactor. </p>
<p>“Nobody wakes up in the morning and buys a loaf of adaptation. You don’t drive around in an adaptation or live in an adaptation,” Koh noted. “What you want is food, transport, shelter, water that is resilient and adapted to the effects of climate change.” What Koh and the team at Lightsmith have found is that many of the companies working on these solutions are hiding in plain sight. “They call themselves business continuity or water efficiency or agricultural precision technologies or supply chain management in the face of weather volatility,” Koh explained. </p>
<p>In this way, the scope of adaptation technology balloons far beyond what is traditionally climate-coded. <a href="https://lightsmithgp.com/news-posts/lightsmith-leads-16-6-million-investment-round-in-digital-health-leader-beep-saude-supporting-climate-resilience-in-healthcare/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Lightsmith recently invested</u></a> in a Brazil-based digital health company called Beep Saude, which enables patients to get rapid, in-home diagnostics, vaccination services, and infusion therapies. It falls under the umbrella of climate adaptation tech, Koh told me, because rising temperatures, increased rainfall, and deforestation in the country have led to a rapid increase in mosquitoes spreading diseases such as dengue fever and the Zika virus. </p>
<p>Naturally, measuring the efficacy of solutions that span such a vast problem space means a lot of customization. “Your metric might be, how many people have asked for water in a drought-prone area?” MacDonald told me. “And with health, it might be, how many children are safe from wildfire smoke during fire season? And for ecosystems, it might be, how many hectares of ecosystem have been saved as a means to reduce storm surge?” Insurance also brings up a host of additional metrics. As Francetic told me, “we measure things like lives and livelihoods covered or addressed. We measure things like losses covered or underwriting dollars spent on this.”</p>
<p>No matter how you categorize it or measure it, the need for these technologies is not going away. “The drivers of adaptation and climate resilience demand are physics and time,” Koh told me. “Whoever develops climate resilience and adaptation technology will have a competitive advantage over any other company, any other society, and the faster that we can scale it up, and the smarter and more equitable we are about deploying it, the better off we will all be.”</p>

## Biden again blasts disinformation after second hurricane batters South

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

WHITE HOUSE — During a briefing Friday on recovery efforts after Hurricane Milton at the White House, U.S. President Joe Biden again warned about the spread of "disgusting" and "dangerous" misinformation and disinformation about the federal government's response to recent storms.


Responding to a reporter's question, Biden said that misleading information hurts people who need the most help. "Widowers, people in hospitals, people who are by themselves and they don't know, and they lose contact, and they get scared to death," he said.


"We're breaking through with it. We're breaking through with the truth," he said, noting that Republican governors and mayors have supported his call to stop the spread of disinformation.


Former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has been spreading disinformation about the government's response, including that the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, is limiting payouts to disaster survivors to $750, and that funding for Americans who are affected by the disaster was used up to provide housing for undocumented immigrants.


"I think those who have been spreading these lies to try to undermine the opposition are going to pay a price for it," Biden said, adding that Trump is not solely to blame but has the "biggest mouth."




Biden provided an update on the federal government's response to hurricanes Milton and Helene flanked by his top aides, including Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas. He was joined virtually by Vice President Kamala Harris from her campaign stop in Arizona.


Harris again warned companies against taking advantage of the storms to increase profit.


"Any company or individual that is using this crisis to jack up prices through illegal fraud or price gouging, whether it be at the gas pump, the airport or the hotel counter, we will be monitoring, and there will be a consequence," she said.


Milton deaths


Authorities in Florida said Friday that Hurricane Milton was responsible for at least 16 deaths, and that more than 2 million people remained without power as evacuees returned to their homes to assess the damage and begin cleaning up from the storm.


As of midday Friday, the website poweroutage.us reported 2.3 million people remained without power. Late Thursday, Biden said more than 50,000 line workers and 1,000 federal personnel were on the ground to respond.


The storm made landfall late Wednesday near Siesta Key in Sarasota County as a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 205 kilometers per hour. It carved a path of destruction across central Florida, affecting many communities still cleaning up from Hurricane Helene two weeks earlier.


While the state's western coast felt the direct hit from the storm, Milton also spawned tornados that affected the southeastern part of the state. Local media reported more than 19 tornadoes touched down even before the hurricane made landfall. Tornadoes are believed responsible for several deaths.




State government officials and the Florida National Guard reported more than 1,000 people were rescued since the storm made landfall.


The U.S. Coast Guard reported one of its aircrews rescued a man Wednesday clinging to a cooler floating in the Gulf of Mexico 48 kilometers off the Florida coast. It said the man was later taken to Tampa General Hospital for medical treatment.


State officials said while total damage assessments are still being made, the storm could have been much worse. The population center of Tampa was spared a direct hit, and the predicted record-setting storm surge did not materialize.


Meanwhile, scientists said climate change made Hurricane Milton stronger and more dangerous.


In a report issued Friday, the nonprofit group Weather Attribution said Milton went through an "explosive intensification" from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane in 24 hours.


The group said the rapid intensification was driven and sustained by very high sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico.


Some information for this report came from Reuters, The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.

## Back-to-back hurricanes reshape 2024 campaign’s final stretch

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — A pair of unwelcome and destructive guests named Helene and Milton have stormed their way into this year's U.S. presidential election.


The back-to-back hurricanes have jumbled the schedules of Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, both of whom devoted part of their recent days to tackling questions about the storm recovery effort.


The two hurricanes are forcing basic questions about who as president would best respond to deadly natural disasters, a once-overlooked issue that has become an increasingly routine part of the job. And just weeks before the November 5 election, the storms have disrupted the mechanics of voting in several key counties.


Vice President Harris is trying to use this as an opportunity to project leadership, appearing alongside President Joe Biden at briefings and calling for bipartisan cooperation. Former President Trump is trying to use the moment to attack the administration's competence and question whether it is withholding help from Republican areas, despite no evidence of such behavior.


Adding to the pressure is the need to provide more money for the Small Business Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which would require House Republicans to work with the Democratic administration. Biden said Thursday that lawmakers should address the situation immediately.


Timothy Kneeland, a professor at Nazareth University in Rochester, New York, who has studied the issue, said, “Dealing with back-to-back crises will put FEMA under more scrutiny and, therefore, the Biden administration will be under a microscope in the days leading up to the election.


“Vice President Harris must empathize with the victims without altering the campaign schedule and provide consistent messaging on the widespread devastation that makes FEMA’s work even more challenging than normal,” Kneeland said.




Already, Trump and Harris have separately gone to Georgia to assess hurricane damage and pledge support, and Harris has visited North Carolina, requiring the candidates to cancel campaign events elsewhere and use up time that is a precious resource in the final weeks before any election. Georgia and North Carolina are political battlegrounds, raising the stakes.


Campaign language altered


The hurricane fallout is evident in the candidates' campaign events as well.


On Thursday, the first question Harris got at a Univision town hall in Las Vegas came from a construction worker and undecided voter from Tampa, Florida. Ramiro Gonzalez asked about talk that the administration has not done enough to support people after Helene, and whether the people in Milton's path would have access to aid — a sign that Trump’s messaging is breaking through with some potential voters.


Harris has called out the level of misinformation being circulated by Republicans, but her fuller answer revealed the dynamics at play just a few weeks before an election.


“I have to stress that this is not a time for people to play politics,” she said.




On the same day, Trump opened his speech at the Detroit Economic Club by praising Republican governors in the affected states and blasting the Biden-Harris administration.


“They’ve let those people suffer unjustly,” he said about those affected by Helene in North Carolina.


Voting systems affected


The storms have also scrambled the voting process in places. North Carolina’s State Board of Elections has passed a resolution to help people in the state's affected counties vote. Florida will allow some counties greater flexibility in distributing mail-in ballots and changing polling sites for in-person voting. But a federal judge in Georgia said Thursday the state doesn't need to reopen voter registration despite the disruptions by Helene.


Tension and controversy have begun to override the disaster response, with Biden on Wednesday and Thursday saying that Trump has spread falsehoods that are “un-American.”


Candace Bright Hall-Wurst, a sociology professor at East Tennessee State University, said that natural disasters have become increasingly politicized, often putting more of the focus on the politicians instead of the people in need.


“Disasters are politicized when they have political value to the candidate," she said. "This does not mean that the politicization is beneficial to victims.”


As the Democratic nominee, Harris has suddenly been a major part of the response to hurricanes, a role that traditionally has not involved vice presidents in prior administrations.


On Thursday, she participated virtually at a Situation Room briefing on Milton while she was in Nevada for campaign activities. She has huddled in meetings about response plans and on Wednesday phoned into CNN live to discuss the administration's efforts.


At a Wednesday appearance with Biden to discuss Milton ahead of it making landfall, Harris subtly tied back the issues into her campaign policies to stop price gouging on food and other products.


“To any company that — or individual that — might use this crisis to exploit people who are desperate for help through illegal fraud or price gouging — whether it be at the gas pump, the airport or the hotel counter — know that we are monitoring these behaviors and the situation on the ground very closely and anyone taking advantage of consumers will be held accountable,” she said.


Harris warned that Milton “poses extreme danger.” It made landfall in Florida late Wednesday and left more than 3 million without power. But the storm surge never reached the same levels as Helene, which led to roughly 230 fatalities and for a prolonged period left mountainous parts of North Carolina without access to electricity, cell service and roads.


Misinformation about Helene


Trump and his allies have seized on the aftermath of Helene to spread misinformation about the administration's response. Their debunked claims include statements that victims can only receive $750 in aid, as well as false charges that emergency response funds were diverted to immigrants.


The former president said the administration's response to Helene was worse than the George W. Bush administration's widely panned handling of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which led to nearly 1,400 deaths.


“This hurricane has been a bad one; Kamala Harris has left them stranded," Trump said at a recent rally in Juneau, Wisconsin. “This is the worst response to a storm or a catastrophe or a hurricane that we’ve ever seen ever. Probably worse than Katrina, and that’s hard to beat, right?"


Asked about the Trump campaign's strategic thinking on emphasizing the hurricane response, campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it reflects a pattern of “failed leadership” by the Biden administration that also includes the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and security at the U.S. southern border.


John Gasper, a Carnegie Mellon University professor who has researched government responses to natural disasters, said storm victims generally want to ensure foremost that they get the aid they need.


“These disasters essentially end up being good tests of leadership for local, state and federal officials in how they respond," he said.


But Gasper noted that U.S. politics have gotten so polarized and other issues such as the economy are shaping the election, such that the debate currently generating so much heat between Trump and the Biden administration might not matter that much on Election Day.

## US lawmakers seek answers from telecoms on Chinese hacking report

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers asked AT&T, Verizon Communications, and Lumen Technologies on Friday to answer questions after a report that Chinese hackers accessed the networks of U.S. broadband providers. 


The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday hackers obtained information from systems the federal government uses for court-authorized wiretapping, and said the three companies were among the telecoms whose networks were breached. 


House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Republican, and the top Democrat on the committee Representative Frank Pallone along with Representatives Bob Latta and Doris Matsui asked the three companies to answer questions. They are seeking a briefing and detailed answers by next Friday. 


"There is a growing concern regarding the cybersecurity vulnerabilities embedded in U.S. telecommunications networks," the lawmakers said. They are asking for details on what information was seized and when the companies learned about the intrusion. 


AT&T and Lumen declined to comment, while Verizon did not immediately comment. 


It was unclear when the hack occurred. 


Hackers might have held access for months to network infrastructure used by the companies to cooperate with court-authorized U.S. requests for communications data, the Journal said. It said the hackers had also accessed other tranches of internet traffic. 


China's foreign ministry said on Sunday that it was not aware of the attack described in the report but said the United States had "concocted a false narrative" to "frame" China in the past.

<p>Stocks are increasingly an important source of household wealth. Thanks to the booming stock market, U.S. household wealth surged to a record high last year, per Federal Reserve data. But there are continued racial differences in stock ownership, which has big implications for the racial wealth gap. We&#8217;ll learn more.

## Blinken warns China against provocations toward Taiwan

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

VIENTIANE, LAOS — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken Friday warned China against military provocations toward Taiwan, following Beijing's strong reaction to an annual speech by the leader of the self-ruled democracy.


“I can tell you that with regard to the so-called Ten Ten speech, which is a regular exercise, China should not use it in any fashion as a pretext for provocative actions,” Blinken told reporters during a press conference in Vientiane, Laos. 


He was referring to October 10, known as Double Ten Day, when Taiwan celebrates the founding of the Republic of China in 1912, just months after an uprising that began on October 10, 1911.


The People's Republic of China celebrates its national day on October 1, marking the founding of the country in 1949. 


China has continued to ramp up its military threats against Taiwan, following President Lai Ching-te's Thursday speech, which rejected China’s claim of sovereignty over the island.




Blinken was in Vientiane for meetings with leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and participated in the East Asia Summit. 


He said there is a strong desire among all ASEAN countries, along with others present, to maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, with neither side taking actions that undermine the status quo.


Earlier on Friday, Taiwan detected 20 Chinese military aircraft and 10 naval vessels around Taiwan. Thirteen of the aircraft crossed the median line and entered Taiwan’s northern and southwestern Air Defense Identification Zone, according to a posting on social media platform X by Taiwan’s defense ministry.




Between Wednesday and Thursday, Taiwan also detected 27 Chinese military aircraft, nine naval vessels, and five official ships.


In Beijing, Chinese officials said Taiwan “has no so-called sovereignty.”


Mao Ning, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry, slammed Lai, accusing him of having "the ill intention of heightening tensions in the Taiwan Strait for his selfish political interest.”


Taiwan has been self-ruled since 1949, when Mao Zedong's communists took power in Beijing after defeating Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang nationalists in a civil war, prompting the nationalists' relocation to the island.


Washington switched its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing to counter the then-Soviet Union in 1979.  


Since then, relations between the U.S. and Taiwan have been governed by the Taiwan Relations Act that Congress passed in April 1979, under which the U.S. provides defense equipment to Taiwan.




 


In September, Taiwan President Lai said if China’s claims over Taiwan are truly based on concerns about territorial integrity, it should also seek to reclaim the 600,000 square kilometers of land it ceded to Russia in the 19th century — an area almost the size of Ukraine.

This should serve as a cautionary tale for would-be plaintiffs: copyright lawsuits, like any other type of litigation, are primarily meant to address the damages plaintiffs actually suffered, and the final settlement should make plaintiffs whole again—that is, as if no infringement has ever occurred. Copyright lawsuits (or the threat to sue) should not be undertaken as a way to create brand new income streams.

## Maybe let’s just not talk about politics at work?

date: 2024-10-11, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve just softened the boundaries a little bit and allowed politics to creep into the workplace,&#8221; says Sean Westwood, director of the Polarization Research Lab at Dartmouth. As part of <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/collection/office-politics/">our Office Politics series</a> in the lead-up to the election, we&#8217;re focusing on how companies intensify or ease political divides. Today: the argument for just not talking about politics or other divisive matters at work. But first, Trump and Harris turn their attention to automakers.</p>

## US still believes Iran has not decided to build a nuclear weapon, US officials say

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The United States still believes that Iran has not decided to build a nuclear weapon despite Tehran's recent strategic setbacks, including Israel's killing of Hezbollah leaders and two largely unsuccessful attempts to attack Israel, two U.S. officials told Reuters.


The comments from a senior Biden administration official and a spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) added to public remarks earlier this week by CIA Director William Burns, who said the United States had not seen any evidence Iran's leader had reversed his 2003 decision to suspend the weaponization program.


"We assess that the Supreme Leader has not made a decision to resume the nuclear weapons program that Iran suspended in 2003," said the ODNI spokesperson, referring to Iran's leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.


The intelligence assessment could help explain U.S. opposition to any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear program in retaliation for a ballistic missile attack that Tehran carried out last week.


U.S. President Joe Biden said after that attack he would not support an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites, but did not explain why he had reached that conclusion. His remarks drew fierce criticism from Republicans, including former President Donald Trump.


U.S. officials have long acknowledged that an attempt to destroy Iran's nuclear weapons program might only delay the country's efforts to develop a nuclear bomb and could even strengthen Tehran's resolve to do so.


"We're all watching this space very carefully," the Biden administration official said.


Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment but Tehran has repeatedly denied ever having had a nuclear weapons program.




Key Iran ally weakened


In the past weeks, Israel's military has inflicted heavy losses on Hezbollah, the most powerful member of the Iran-backed network known as the Axis of Resistance. The group's setbacks have included the killing of its leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike last month.


The weakening of a key Iranian ally has prompted some experts to speculate that Tehran may restart its efforts to acquire a nuclear bomb to protect itself.


Beth Sanner, a former U.S deputy director of national intelligence, said the risk of Khamenei reversing his 2003 religious dictum against nuclear weapons is "higher now than it has been" and that if Israel were to strike nuclear facilities Tehran would likely move ahead with building a nuclear weapon.


That would still take time, however.


"They can't get a weapon in a day. It will take months and months and months," said Sanner, now a fellow with the German Marshall Fund.


Iran is now enriching uranium to up to 60% fissile purity, close to the 90% of weapons grade, at two sites, and in theory it has enough material enriched to that level, if enriched further, for almost four bombs, according to a yardstick of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the U.N. watchdog.


The expansion in Iran's enrichment program has reduced the so-called breakout time it would need to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb to "a week or a little more," according to Burns, from more than a year under a 2015 accord that Trump pulled out of when president. Actually making a bomb with that material would take longer. How long is less clear and the subject of debate.


Possible Israeli attack


Israel has not yet disclosed what it will target in retaliation for Iran's attack last week with more than 180 ballistic missiles, which largely failed thanks to interceptions by Israeli air defenses as well as by the U.S. military.


The United States has been privately urging Israel to calibrate its response to avoid triggering a broader war in the Middle East, officials say, with Biden publicly voicing his opposition to a nuclear attack and concerns about a strike on Iran's energy infrastructure.


Israel, however, views Iran's nuclear program as an existential threat.


The conflicts in the Middle East between Israel and Iran and Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Gaza and Yemen have become campaign issues ahead of the November 5 presidential election, with Trump and his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, positioning themselves as pro-Israel.


Speaking at a campaign event last week, Trump mocked Biden for opposing an attack on Iran's nuclear sites, saying: "That's the thing you wanna hit, right?"


Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence officer and government official, said Iran still had space to compensate for setbacks dealt to its proxies and missile force without having to resort to developing a nuclear warhead.


"The Iranians have to recalculate what's next. I don't think at this point they will rush to either develop or boost the (nuclear) program toward military capacity," he said.


"They will look around to find what maneuvering space they can move around in."

## Blinken tells ASEAN the US is worried about China's actions in South China Sea

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

VIENTIANE, Laos — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Southeast Asian leaders Friday that the U.S. is concerned about China's "increasingly dangerous and unlawful" activities in the disputed South China Sea during an annual summit meeting and pledged the U.S. will continue to uphold freedom of navigation in the vital sea trade route.


The 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ meeting with Blinken followed a series of violent confrontations at sea between China and ASEAN members Philippines and Vietnam, which have fueled concerns that China’s increasingly assertive actions in the waterways could spiral into a full-scale conflict.


China, which claims almost the entire sea, has overlapping claims with ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei, as well as Taiwan. About a third of global trade transits through the sea, which is also rich in fishing stocks, gas and oil.


Beijing has refused to recognize a 2016 international arbitration ruling by a U.N.-affiliated court in the Hague that invalidated its expansive claims and has built up and militarized islands it controls.


"We are very concerned about China’s increasingly dangerous and unlawful activities in the South China Sea which have injured people, harm vessels from ASEAN nations and contradict commitments to peaceful resolutions of disputes," said Blinken, who is filling in for President Joe Biden, in his opening speech at the U.S.-ASEAN summit. "The United States will continue to support freedom of navigation, and freedom of overflight in the Indo Pacific."


The United States has no claims in the South China Sea but has deployed navy ships and fighter jets to patrol the waters in a challenge to China’s claims.




Chinese and Philippine vessels have clashed repeatedly this year, and Vietnam said last week that Chinese forces assaulted its fishermen in the disputed sea. China has also sent patrol vessels to areas that Indonesia and Malaysia claim as exclusive economic zones.


The United States has warned repeatedly that it’s obligated to defend the Philippines — its oldest treaty ally in Asia — if Filipino forces, ships or aircraft come under armed attack, including in the South China Sea.


Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. complained to summit leaders on Thursday that his country "continues to be subject to harassment and intimidation" by China. He said it was "regrettable that the overall situation in the South China Sea remains tense and unchanged" due to China’s actions, which he said violated international law. He has called for more urgency in ASEAN-China negotiations on a code of conduct to govern the South China Sea.


Singaporean leader Lawrence Wong earlier this week warned of "real risks of an accident spiraling into conflict" if the sea dispute isn't addressed.


Malaysia, who takes over the rotating ASEAN chair next year, is expected to push to accelerate talks on the code of conduct. Officials have agreed to try and complete the code by 2026, but talks have been hampered by sticky issues including disagreements over whether the pact should be binding.


Chinese Premier Li Qiang was defiant during talks on Thursday. He called South China Sea a "shared home" but repeated China’s assertion that it was merely protecting its sovereign rights, officials said. Li also blamed meddling by "external forces" who sought to "introduce bloc confrontation and geopolitical conflicts into Asia." Li didn’t name the foreign forces, but China has previously warned the U.S. not to meddle in the region’s territorial disputes.


In another firm message to China, Blinken said the United States believed "it is also important to maintain our shared commitment to protect stability across the Taiwan Strait." China claims the self-ruled island of Taiwan as its own territory and bristles at other countries’ patrolling the body of water separating it from the island.


Blinken also attended an 18-nation East Asia Summit, along with the Chinese premier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and leaders from Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand.


ASEAN has treaded carefully on the sea dispute with China, which is the bloc's largest trading partner and its third largest investor. It hasn't marred trade relations, with the two sides focusing on expanding a free trade area covering a market of 2 billion people.


Blinken said the annual ASEAN summit talks were a platform to address other shared challenges including the civil war in Myanmar, North Korea’s "destabilizing behavior" and Russia’s war aggression in Ukraine. He said the U.S. remained the top foreign investor in the region and aims to strengthen its partnership with ASEAN.

## Hurricane Milton disrupts Yom Kippur plans for Jews in Florida

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

WINTER PARK, Florida — Many Jews worldwide will mark Yom Kippur in fasting and prayer at their synagogues this weekend.


But for the faithful in Florida, destructive Hurricane Milton has disrupted plans for observing the Day of Atonement — the holiest day of the year in the Jewish faith — that begins Friday evening and caps off the High Holy Days that began with Rosh Hashana on October 2.


Across the storm-threatened areas, rabbis and their congregants spent part of the Days of Awe — the span between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur — protecting their homes and synagogues as Milton churned off the coast, spiraling into a Category 5 storm. Many — though not all — evacuated, heeding the voluntary and mandatory orders, and found safekeeping for their synagogues' Torah scrolls and themselves.


Milton hit Florida's Gulf Coast on Wednesday as a Category 3 cyclone, with damaging winds, heavy rains and tornadoes. By Thursday, the storm had moved eastward into the Atlantic Ocean.


Why this rabbi decided against evacuating before storm


Rabbi Yitzchok Minkowicz evacuated most of his family ahead of the storm, but chose to ride it out with his son, also a rabbi, at Chabad Lubavitch of Southwest Florida near Fort Myers. The center is hosting people displaced by the storm, including doctors, first responders and elderly who cannot evacuate.


It's important to be "with the people and for the people," and provide emotional and spiritual support, he said as the storm approached.




Near midnight Thursday, the Chabad center and the rest of the neighborhood lost power, said Minkowicz, making them among the millions without it. The center was spared from the storm surge, but homes and other buildings in the area were not, he said.


"Our pressing need is for Power so that we can help our community & hold Yom Kippur services," Minkowicz told The Associated Press via email Thursday. "We're praying for this to be resolved asap."


The center planned to host Yom Kippur observances regardless of the storm. He said it was similar two years ago, when the holy day followed the major hurricane, Ian.


"Yom Kippur is a day that you open up your soul to God and you totally connect with God," Minkowicz said. "When you go through a hurricane, anything materialistic is not important. They're already in that zone where they're totally focused on God."


Congregation Beth Am in the Tampa Bay area also lost power and plans to hold Yom Kippur services online, said Rabbi Jason Rosenberg of the Reform synagogue.


"It's important to keep perspective. Having a service online is not what anybody wants, but it could've been a lot worse," he said. "This feels like a blessing."


The storm underscored one of Yom Kippur's annual reflections.


An implicit question, he said before Milton's landfall, is "If this was going to be your last year on earth, how would you want to act differently? ... When you've got a historical storm, a potentially life-threatening and life-altering storm bearing down on you, that message is really present."


Milton disrupts Yom Kippur and October 7 commemoration


Like most of her congregants, Rabbi Nicole Luna had evacuated after helping secure Temple Beth El in Fort Myers, and entrusting several Torah scrolls to congregants should the threatened surge devastate the synagogue.


While the congregation braved Hurricanes Irma in 2017 and Ian in 2022, Milton's timing hit especially hard, having already forced the postponement of community-wide commemoration of Hamas attacking Israel on October 7, 2023. The war that followed is ongoing.


"It just feels like too much for our hearts to carry right now," Luna said from Miami ahead of the storm. "It's all very heavy."


After the storm passed through, Luna told her congregation that their synagogue had emerged undamaged, though it lost power.


She announced plans for a service via Zoom on Friday evening, and in-person services Saturday.


"We hope by Saturday more traffic lights will be restored but please only come if you can safely navigate the roads," she said in her message.


Luna said she was grateful for the "big outpouring of support" she received from fellow rabbis across the East Coast of Florida, who were opening their temples for the holidays to evacuees and have emphasized they can come as they are since few grabbed "holiday-appropriate clothing" in the rush to escape Milton's fury.


The Chabad of Southwest Broward near Fort Lauderdale is hosting several evacuees from areas most affected by the storm, ranging from a mother with her newborn to an elderly couple, said director Rabbi Pinny Andrusier. They are invited to spend Yom Kippur with the Cooper City-based group, including sharing kosher meals before and after the day of fasting.


"We were spared, thank God," Andrusier said of the storm. "We've been able to open up our doors" for those in the hurricane zone.


Synagogue skips holding Yom Kippur services


Hundreds of Jewish families on Longboat Key, a barrier island off Sarasota Bay, won't be able to observe Yom Kippur in their synagogue for the very first time in their 45-year history, said Shepard Englander, CEO of The Jewish Federation of Sarasota-Manatee.


Access to the island, specifically the John Ringling Causeway, was closed ahead of the storm. The congregation decided it wasn't worth risking Milton's might for Day of Atonement services. They had celebrated Rosh Hashana in their building despite a number of nearby homes being damaged by Hurricane Helene, which made landfall last month.


Englander said he and his family evacuated from their home on a riverbank outside Sarasota and were hunkered down at a friend's home inland. From there, he was trying to make sure community members from Longboat Key and other temples that won't have services can say their prayers and break their daylong Yom Kippur fast at a newly constructed conference center in Sarasota with food items like blintzes, bagels, cream cheese and smoked salmon.


Ahead of the storm, people were scattered in the region at emergency shelters or staying with family or friends, Englander said.


"It's in difficult times that you really understand the power of community," he said. "And this is a caring, tight-knit, generous Jewish community."

## 12 rescued from Colorado gold mine where elevator mishap killed 1 person

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

denver — Twelve people were rescued Thursday night after being trapped for about six hours at the bottom of a former Colorado gold mine when an elevator malfunctioned at the tourist site, authorities said. One person died in the accident.


The elevator was descending into the Mollie Kathleen Gold Mine near the town of Cripple Creek when it had a mechanical problem around 150 meters beneath the surface, creating a "severe danger for the participants," and one person was killed, Teller County Sheriff Jason Mikesell said.


The 12 adults who were trapped were about 305 meters below ground, but they had access to water and the atmosphere was considered good. They were safe and in communication with authorities with radios while waiting, Mikesell said.


They were in good spirits after they were rescued, and authorities gave them pizza once they were out and told them everything that had happened, he said. While at the bottom, authorities had told them only that there was an elevator issue.


Mikesell said during a nighttime briefing that authorities do not know yet what caused the malfunction and an investigation is underway. Engineers worked to make sure the elevator was working safely again before bringing the stranded visitors back up on it. They had been prepared to bring them up by rope if necessary, had they not been able to get the elevator fixed.


Mikesell declined to reveal the identification of the victim.


The incident, which was reported to authorities at about noon, happened during the final week of the Mollie Kathleen Gold Mine season before it shuts down for the winter, Mikesell said.


Earlier in the afternoon — while the 12 were stuck at the bottom — 11 other people who were riding the elevator were rescued. Four had minor injuries. The sheriff did not elaborate on how they were injured.


The elevator ride typically takes about two minutes, travelling about 152 meters per minute, according to the mine's website.


Mikesell said the last time there was an incident was in the 1980s when a couple of people were trapped on the elevator. Nobody died in that incident.


Mines that operate as tourist attractions in Colorado must designate someone to inspect the mines and the transportation systems daily, according to the state Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety. Mikesell said he didn't know the date of the last inspection. Records of the inspections weren't immediately available online.


Gov. Jared Polis sent state resources including a mine rescue team.
