<h2
id="i-still-dont-think-companies-serve-you-ads-based-on-spying-through-your-microphone">I
still don’t think companies serve you ads based on spying through your
microphone</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-02, updated: 2025-01-02, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
One of my weirder hobbies is trying to convince people that the idea
that companies are listening to you through your phone’s microphone and
serving you targeted ads is a conspiracy theory that isn’t true. I wrote
about this previously:
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/14/ai-trust-crisis/#facebook-dont-spy-microphone">Facebook
don’t spy on you through your microphone</a>.
</p>
<p>
(Convincing people of this is basically impossible. It doesn’t matter
how good your argument is, if someone has ever seen an ad that relates
to their previous voice conversation they are likely convinced and
there’s nothing you can do to talk them out of it. Gimlet media did
<a href="https://gimletmedia.com/amp/shows/reply-all/z3hlwr">a great
podcast episode</a> about how impossible this is back in 2017.)
</p>
<p>
This is about to get even harder thanks to this proposed settlement:
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/apple-agrees-to-pay-95m-delete-private-conversations-siri-recorded/">Siri
“unintentionally” recorded private convos; Apple agrees to pay $95M</a>
(Ars Technica).
</p>
<p>
Apple are spending $95m (nine hours of profit), agreeing to settle while
“denying wrongdoing”.
</p>
<p>
What actually happened is it turns out Apple were capturing snippets of
audio surrounding the “Hey Siri” wake word, sending those back to their
servers and occasionally using them for QA, without informing users that
they were doing this. This is bad.
</p>
<p>
The Reuters 2021 story
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-must-face-siri-voice-assistant-privacy-lawsuit-us-judge-2021-09-02/">Apple
must face Siri voice assistant privacy lawsuit -U.S. judge</a> reported
that:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
One Siri user said his private discussions with his doctor about a
“brand name surgical treatment” caused him to receive targeted ads for
that treatment, while two others said their discussions about Air Jordan
sneakers, Pit Viper sunglasses and “Olive Garden” caused them to receive
ads for those products.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The claim from that story was then repeated in
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/apple-pay-95-million-settle-siri-privacy-lawsuit-2025-01-02/">the
2025 Reuters story</a> about the settlement.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/apple-agrees-to-pay-95m-delete-private-conversations-siri-recorded/">Ars
Technica story</a> reframes that like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The only clue that users seemingly had of Siri’s alleged spying was
eerily accurate targeted ads that appeared after they had just been
talking about specific items like Air Jordans or brands like Olive
Garden, Reuters
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/apple-pay-95-million-settle-siri-privacy-lawsuit-2025-01-02/">noted</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Crucially, this was never <em>proven in court</em>. And if Apple settle
the case it never will be.
</p>
<p>
Let’s think this through. For the accusation to be true, Apple would
need to be recording those wake word audio snippets and transmitting
them back to their servers for additional processing (likely true), but
then they would need to be feeding those snippets <em>in almost real
time</em> into a system which forwards them onto advertising partners
who then feed that information into targeting networks such that next
time you view an ad on your phone the information is available to help
select the relevant ad.
</p>
<p>
That is <em>so far fetched</em>. Why would Apple do that? Especially
given both their brand and reputation as a privacy-first company
combined with the large amounts of product design and engineering work
they’ve put into preventing apps from doing exactly this kind of thing
by enforcing permission-based capabilities <em>and</em> ensuring a
“microphone active” icon is available at all times when an app is
listening in.
</p>
<p>
I really don’t think this is happening - in particular for Siri wake
words!
</p>
<p id="argued-these-points">
I’ve
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/14/ai-trust-crisis/#facebook-dont-spy-microphone">argued
these points before</a>, but I’ll do it again here for good measure.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
You don’t notice the hundreds of times a day you say something and
<em>don’t</em> see a relevant advert a short time later. You see
thousands of ads a day, can you remember what <em>any</em> of them are?
</li>
<li>
The tiny fraction of times where you see an ad that’s relevant to
something you’ve just said (hence breaking through your filter that
prevents you from seeing most ads at all) stick in your head.
</li>
<li>
Human beings are pattern matching machines with a huge bias towards
personal anecdotes. If we’ve seen direct evidence of something
ourselves, good luck talking us out of it!
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I think the truth of the matter here is much more pedestrian: the
quality of ad targeting that’s possible just through apps sharing data
on your regular actions within those apps is shockingly high… combined
with the fact that it turns out just knowing “male, 40s, NYC” is often
more than enough - we’re all pretty basic!
</p>
<p>
I fully expect that this Apple story will be used as “proof” by
conspiracy theorists effectively forever.

I find the idea of predicting six months ahead in terms of LLMs hard to

<h2 id="ending-a-year-long-posting-streak">Ending a year long posting
streak</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-02, updated: 2025-01-02, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
A year ago today I wrote about
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jan/2/escalating-streaks/">Tom
Scott’s legendary 10 year YouTube streak</a>, in which he posted a new
video once a week for the next ten years. Inspired by that, I also
started my own.
</p>
<p>
I set myself the goal of posting something to my blog every day for a
year.
</p>
<p>
Given how much happened in my chosen field of
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/31/llms-in-2024/">Large
Language Models over the course of 2024</a> this wasn’t as hard as I had
expected!
</p>
<p>
One of the lessons I learned from Tom is that it’s much healthier for a
streak to have a predetermined end - that way the streak can act as a
goal that doesn’t turn into an ongoing imposition.
</p>
<p>
I’m calling it: this streak is done. According to
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/dashboard/streaks-with-post-count/">my
custom dashboard</a> I hit 367 days - December 31st 2023 to December
31st 2024, inclusive (it was a leap year) - 1,151 posts in total.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/jan-streak.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" alt="Table of data. Row 1 has duration in days=1, start date=2025-01-02, end date=2025-01-02, num posts=1. Row 2 has duration in days=367, start date=2023-12-31, end date=2024-12-31, num posts=1151. Row 3 has duration in days=1, start date=2023-12-23, end date=2023-12-23, num posts=1. Row 4 has duration in days=4, start date=2023-12-18, end date=2023-12-21, num posts=6." />
</p>
<p>
I’m going to drop back to a much more reasonable target of at least one
long-form post per week and at least three days per week with a link or
quote - see
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/">My approach
to running a link blog</a> for how I think about that kind of content.
</p>
<p>
Posting daily has been fun, but it definitely impacted my productivity
on my other projects. My blog runs on UTC so it also resulted in a minor
panic coming up to 4pm Pacific coast time if I hadn’t posted anything
yet!
</p>
<p>
Almost every post in the streak came out in 2024, so my
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?year=2024">faceted search
engine for 2024</a> provides a way to explore them.
</p>
<p>
My <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/">2024 archive page</a> also
serves up this illustrative tag cloud:

Decline of Software Engineering</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-02, updated: 2025-01-02, from: Tom Kellog blog</p>
<p>There’s a common refrain that “AI won’t replace software engineers”,
often with the resolution, “you’ll be replaced by software engineers
that use AI”, implying that AI will be used to make software engineers
more productive and efficient. I argue that software engineers will be
replaced by normies, non-engineers (accountants, lawyers, etc.) that are
empowered to create their own software to solve their own problems.</p>

<p>
Carbonfact’s customers are clothing brands and factories. Our mission is
to measure (and ultimately reduce) the carbon footprint of their
products. We need primary data to do this: purchase orders, bills of
materials, energy consumption data, etc.
</p>
<p>
Each customer has a unique IT setup, which makes it challenging to scale
to hundreds/thousands of customers. Our success as a business depends on
our ability to not reinvent the wheel for each customer.
