<h1>
Challenges players face
</h1>
<p>
I’m running Arden Vul as an open table. Sessions are generally less than
2h long. There are maybe a dozen players, maybe half of them regulars.
Arden Vul is a megadungeon. The PDF has about 1200 pages. There are many
entrances, many levels, many factions, and so on. As it is a
megadungeon, players can choose for themselves what difficulty level
they want to go for. Conversely, if there’s a new player with a level 1
character, they can all agree to stick to lower level characters in
order to make an adventure party that promises an entertaining evening
for all.
</p>
<p>
Recently, I’ve started noticing that the setup introduces some player
challenges that I hadn’t thought of.
</p>
<p>
If the party is powerful and the opposition is strong but clearly less
powerful, then frontal assaults “work” but at the same time the session
only lasts for a certain number of hours and endless fighting killing
many dozens of goblins turns out to be somewhat boring.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, countless waves of weak opposition are both boring and sap
away time. Even if the characters aren’t hurt, time is lost.
</p>
<p>
These are challenges that attack player entertainment somewhat like
character death or long character creation, I feel.
</p>
<p>
You know how regular combat in the game attacks the player characters.
Some elements of it also attack player resources. This is mostly related
to character death. The result forces the player to do things they
dislike: start with a new character that has fewer levels, fewer
connections, less money, or incurs some other loss. Furthermore, if
character creation takes a very long time, then the player has to spend
the time thinking up a new build, a new concept.
</p>
<p>
In a way, an opposition that acts like a morass, wasting time unless the
players find another way to circumvent the problem, is a similar attack
upon the enjoyment of players. No amount of attack bonuses and
initiatives won helps against waves of undead if you can’t turn them or
hold them off some other way.
</p>
<p>
But there is more!
</p>
<p>
Since the megadungeon has a lot of doors and secrets that need keys, and
artefacts that are required for certain goals or quests, it’s important
to note who has what, and where it was found. I don’t want there to be a
virtual pool of plot items in a bag of holding that is always with the
group currently adventuring because even though everybody likes it now I
dread the first total party kill where I announce that all the plot
items are now lost. That’ll be the end of the campaign for sure.
</p>
<p>
I confess that I also hope on some level that knowing who has what
plot-relevant item increases interactivity as people start to realize
that for this or that to happen, they need to contact the player of the
character who’s the owner of a particular item.
</p>
<p>
But yes, if players stop showing up, their characters don’t show up and
the items they have, both magic items they found and plot items they
hold, effectively disappear from the game.
</p>
<p>
So this is an additional player challenge of their organisational
skills. Can they keep track of the items? Can they organise hand-overs?
</p>
<p>
Arden Vul is also a megadungeon where hints can be found in the hundreds
of rumours, wall scribbles, frescos, mosaics, and so on. But if nobody
collects and studies them, the information is effectively lost. If one
player keeps notes on paper, or in their Google Docs, that information
is effectively lost to the others.
</p>
<p>
I know that as a player in the Barrowmaze I’m also not a great organiser
of rumours heard and information gathered. There is space for
improvement!
</p>
<p>
So this is another player challenge, but not it’s about information
sharing. Can they build a knowledge repository somewhere, that helps
them distribute information and collect hypothesises and conclusions?
</p>
<p>
The same is true about the ruins explored, entrances found, and perhaps
more importantly, the places where no entrances were found but also they
left before making absolutely sure. In a few sessions, players don’t
remember where they’ve been and they don’t remember whether an area was
fully explored. This duplicates effort and lost opportunities.
</p>
<p>
All in all, this is a sort of price to pay for the freedom players have
in this kind of setup.

<h2 id="us-launches-follow-up-strike-on-houthi-radar-site">US Launches
Follow-Up Strike on Houthi Radar Site</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The United States launched a follow-up strike against a
Houthi target in Yemen early Saturday, after officials said they were
not satisfied with the damage inflicted during the initial round of
airstrikes late Thursday. </p>
<p>U.S. Central Command said it launched the additional strike from the
USS Carney, a guided missile destroyer, firing multiple Tomahawk Land
Attack Missiles to take out a radar site that it said presented a
continuing threat to maritime traffic.   </p>
<p>The strike comes a little more than a day after the U.S. and British
militaries carried out dozens of strikes against Houthi positions in
Yemen in retaliation for weeks of Houthi attacks that have disrupted
shipping and damaged vessels transiting the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.
   </p>
<p>Early Friday, Houthi militants launched an anti-ship ballistic
missile, U.S. military officials confirmed, though it did not hit any
ships.   </p>
<p>U.S. and British officials had expressed optimism Friday that the
initial strikes late Thursday, which are now being described as two
waves of strikes, were successful.   </p>
<p>A U.S. defense official told VOA on Friday that the
initial assessment indicates the first wave of precision strikes late on
Thursday degraded the ability of the Houthis to launch further attacks.
       </p>
<p>The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to
discuss operational details, said a more comprehensive assessment of the
strikes was still underway. But the sentiment echoed other early
assessments by senior U.S. officials, who have described the damage to
Houthi capabilities as “significant.”      </p>
<p>“We feel very confident about where our munitions struck,” Lieutenant
General Douglas Sims, the director of the Joint Staff, told reporters
Friday. “But we don’t know at this point the complete battle damage
assessment.”</p>
<p> More than 150 munitions aimed at Houthis</p>
<p>U.S. Central Command late Thursday said that U.S. fighter jets, naval
vessels and submarines hit more than 60 targets at 16 locations across
Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen, including command and control nodes,
munitions depots, launching systems, and production
facilities.        </p>
<p>But, Sims said Friday, the U.S. and Britain launched a second wave of
strikes against another 12 locations 30 minutes to an hour after the
initial strikes were carried out.         </p>
<p>The additional sites, each with multiple targets, “had been
identified as possessing articles that could be potentially used against
forces, maritime and air,” he said, noting the strikes were taken in
self-defense.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said, in all, more than 150 precision guided munitions
were aimed at Houthi targets, including Tomahawk missiles.    </p>
<p>At least three U.S. guided missile cruisers and destroyers — the USS
Gravely, the USS Philippine Sea, and the USS Mason — took part in the
strikes along with an Ohio-class submarine, fighter jets from the USS
Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier, and U.S. Air Force jets.    </p>
<p>A separate statement Friday from the British Defense Ministry said
four of its Typhoon fighter jets, accompanied by an air refueling
tanker, used laser-guided bombs to hit two locations: a drone launch
site in Bani, in northwestern Yemen, and an airfield in Abbs used to
launch cruise missiles and drones at ships in the Red Sea.    </p>
<p>“Early indications are that the Houthis’ ability to threaten merchant
shipping has taken a blow,” the ministry said.   </p>
<p>Retaliation likely, say US officials </p>
<p>Despite the optimistic strike assessments, U.S. officials said they
believe the Houthis are likely to retaliate.    </p>
<p>“My guess is that the Houthis are trying to figure things out on the
ground and trying to determine what capabilities still exist for them,”
Sims said. “Their rhetoric has been pretty strong and pretty high, and I
would expect that they will attempt some sort of retaliation.”   </p>
<p>“I would hope they wouldn’t,” he added, describing the Houthi efforts
as “generally fruitless.”    </p>
<p>But the White House repeated its warning Friday that the Houthis
would face additional consequences if their attacks
persisted.       </p>
<p>“We will make sure that we respond to the Houthis if they continue
this outrageous behavior, along with our allies,” U.S. President Joe
Biden said in response to reporters’ questions during a stop at a coffee
shop in Pennsylvania on Friday.    </p>
<p>Reporters asked him if the Houthis are terrorists, and he replied, “I
think they are.” In 2021, his administration removed the Houthis from
the State Department’s list of foreign terrorist organizations. </p>
<p>Also Friday, the U.S. unveiled new sanctions aimed at commodity
shipments that have been funding the Houthis and their Iranian backers.
        </p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Department officials imposed sanctions on a
Hong-Kong-based company and another company in the United Arab Emirates,
both of which have been working with Sa’id al-Jamal, a financier who has
been supporting both the Houthis and Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard
Corps Quds Force.    </p>
<p>“We will take all available measures to stop the destabilizing
activities of the Houthis and their threats to global commerce,”
Treasury Undersecretary Brian Nelson said in a statement.    </p>
<p>Since mid-November, the Houthis have launched at least 28
attacks, affecting citizens, cargo and vessels from more than 50
countries, according to the U.S.            </p>
<p>U.S. officials have said that Biden made the decision to launch
Thursday’s strikes following a Houthi attack on shipping lanes in the
Red Sea and Gulf of Aden on Tuesday that involved 18 one-way attack
drones, two cruise missiles and one ballistic
missile.                </p>
<p>U.S. combat jets, along with U.S. and British military vessels,
responded by shooting down the drones and missiles, averting any damage
to ships or injuries to their crews in the area.        </p>
<p>Last week, the United States and 12 allies issued a statement warning
the Houthis of unspecified consequences if their attacks on shipping in
the Red Sea continued.                </p>
<p>The statement followed the launch in mid-December of Operation
Prosperity Guardian by the United States, Britain and nearly 20 other
countries to protect ships from Houthi attacks.                </p>
<p>Since the launch of Prosperity Guardian, at least 1,500 vessels have
passed safely through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which connects the Red
Sea with the Gulf of Aden.      </p>
<p>The U.N. Security Council adopted its own resolution Wednesday,
calling on the Houthis to stop the attacks immediately.           </p>
<p>But Russia, which abstained in the vote, called for an emergency
meeting of the council Friday evening to discuss the strikes. Ambassador
Vassily Nebenzia called the U.S.-British strikes a “blatant armed
aggression against another country.” He argued that the strikes did not
meet the conditions for self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N.
Charter.  </p>
<p>“Article 51 does not apply to the situation with commercial
shipping,” Nebenzia said. “The right to self-defense cannot be exercised
in order to ensure the freedom of shipping. Our American colleagues know
this fact very well.”   </p>
<p>In a statement Friday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said
attacks against international shipping in the Red Sea area are “not
acceptable” and endanger the safety and security of global supply chains
and have a negative impact on the economic and humanitarian situation
worldwide. He urged the Houthis to immediately cease their attacks and
called for all parties to respect the Security Council resolution in its
entirety.  </p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the Council that the
strikes were consistent with international law and Article 51. She said
Washington does not take such strikes lightly and they were only carried
out “after non-military options proved inadequate to address the
threat.”   </p>

<p>date: 2024-01-13, from: San Jose Mercury News</p>
<p>A long weekend of ferocious winter weather loomed across the U.S. on
Saturday, as a continuing wave of Arctic storms threatened to break
low-temperature records in the nation’s heartland, spread cold and snow
from coast to coast and cast a chill over everything ranging from
football playoffs to presidential campaigns.</p>

US Delivered Private Message to Iran About Houthi Attacks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden said Saturday the United States
had delivered a private message to Iran about Iran-backed Houthis
responsible for attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea. </p>
<p>“We delivered it privately, and we’re confident we’re well-prepared,”
Biden told reporters at the White House before departing to the Camp
David presidential retreat for the weekend. </p>
<p>The Houthi movement threatened a “strong and effective response”
after the United States carried out another strike in Yemen overnight,
further ratcheting up tensions as Washington vows to protect shipping
from attacks by the Iran-aligned group. </p>
<p>The latest strike, which the U.S. said hit a radar site, came a day
after dozens of American and British strikes on Houthi facilities in
Yemen. </p>
<p>White House spokesperson John Kirby said Friday the initial strikes
had hit the Houthis’ ability to store, launch and guide missiles or
drones, which the group has used to threaten shipping. </p>
<p>He said Washington had no interest in a war with Yemen. </p>
<p>Biden, whose administration removed the Houthis from a State
Department list of “foreign terrorist organizations” in 2021, was asked
by reporters Friday whether he felt the term “terrorist” described the
movement now. “I think they are,” Biden said.</p>

Tech workers and gig workers need each other (13 Jan 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-13, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Tech workers and gig workers need each other: Each
disenshittifies the other. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This
day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent
publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects,
current reading Tech workers and gig workers need each other (permalink)
We’re living in the enshittocene, in which the forces of
enshittification are turning everything from our cars to our streaming
services to our dishwashers into thoroughly enshittifified piles of
shit. Call it the Great Enshittening:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/09/lead-me-not-into-temptation/#chamberlain
How did we arrive at this juncture? Is it the end of the zero rate
interest policy? Was it that the companies that formerly made useful
things that we valued underwent a change in leadership that drove them
to make things worse? Is Mercury in retrograde? None of the above. There
have been many junctures in which investors demanded higher returns from
firms but were not able to force them to dramatically worsen their
products. Moreover, the leaders now presiding over the rapid unscheduled
disassembly of once-useful products are the same people who oversaw
their golden age. As to Mercury? Well, I’m a Cancer, and as everyone
knows, Cancers don’t believe in astrology. The Great Enshittening isn’t
precipitated by a change in how greedy and callous corporate leaders
are. Rather, the change is in what those greedy, callous corporate
leaders can get away with. Capitalists hate capitalism. For a corporate
executive, the fact that you have to make good things, please your
customers, pay your workers, and beat the competition are all bugs, not
features. The best business is one in which people simply pay you money
without your having to do anything or worry that someday they’ll stop.
UBI for the investor class, in other words. Douglas Rushkoff calls this
“going meta.” Don’t sell things, provide a platform where people sell
things. Don’t provide a platform, invest in the platform. Don’t invest
in the platform, buy options on the platform. Don’t buy options, buy
derivatives of options. A more precise analysis comes from economist
Yanis Varoufakis, who calls this technofeudalism. Varoufakis draws our
attention to the distinction between profits and rents. Profit is the
income a capitalist receives from mobilizing workers to do something
productive and then skimming off the surplus created by their labor. By
contrast, rent is income a feudalist derives from simply owning
something that a capitalist or a worker needs in order to be productive.
The entrepreneur who opens a coffee shop earns profits by creaming off
the surplus value created by the baristas. The rentier who owns the
building the coffee shop rents gets money simply for owning the
building. The coffee shop owner can never rest. At any moment, another
coffee shop can open down the street and lure away their customers and
their baristas. When that happens, the coffee shop goes bust and the
owner is ruined. But not the landlord! After the coffee shop goes bust,
the landlord’s asset is more valuable – an empty storefront just down
the street from the hottest coffee shop in town. Capitalists hate
capitalism. Faced with a choice of retaining their workers by paying
them a fair wage and treating them well, or by saddling them with
noncompetes that make it impossible to work for anyone else in the same
field, and obligations to repay tens of thousands of dollars for
“training” if they quit, bosses will take the latter every time. Go
meta, baby. Same for competition. Faced with the choice of competing to
win the most customers with the best products, or merging so that
customers have nowhere else to go, even the bitterest of rivals find it
remarkably easy to intermarry until our corporations landscape is so
interbred the dominant firms all have Habsburg jaws. Think:
Facebook-Instagram. Disney-Fox. Microsoft-Activision:
https://locusmag.com/2021/07/cory-doctorow-tech-monopolies-and-the-insufficient-necessity-of-interoperability/
Enshittification has complex underlying dynamics and a reliable
procession of stages, but the effect is quite straightforward: things
are enshittified when they become worse for the people who use them and
the suppliers who makes them, but nevertheless, the users keep using and
the suppliers keep supplying. There are four forces that stand in the
way of enshittification, and as each of these forces grows weaker,
enshittification proliferates. The first and most important of these
constraints is competition. Capitalists claim to love competition
because it keeps firms sharp: they must constantly find ways to improve
products and cut costs or be swept away by a superior alternative.
There’s a degree of truth here, but that’s not the whole story. For one
thing, competition can “improve” things that we would rather see
abolished. Critics of the GDPR, the EU’s landmark privacy law, often
point to the devastation that enforcing privacy law had on the European
ad-tech industry, driving small firms out of business. But these firms
were the most egregious privacy offenders, because they had the least to
lose, lacking the dominant position of US-based Big Tech surveillance
companies. Having the least to lose, they were the most reckless with
their privacy invasions – but they were also the least equipped to pay
expensive enablers from giant corporate law firms to hold off European
enforcers, and so they were obliterated. The resulting lack of
competition is fine, as far as privacy goes: we don’t want competition
in the field of “who is most efficient at violating our human rights”:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/04/fighting-floc-and-fighting-monopoly-are-fully-compatible
But there’s another benefit to competition: disorganization. A sector
with hundreds of medium-sized, competing companies is a squabbling mob,
incapable of agreeing on the site for an annual meeting. An industry
dominated by a handful of firms is a cartel, handily capable of
presenting a unified front to policy makers, and their commercial
coziness provides them with vast war-chests they can use to suborn
governments and capture their regulators:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/06/05/regulatory-capture/ Competition is
the first constraint. When there’s competition, corporate managers fear
that you will respond to enshittification by defecting to a rival,
costing them money. They don’t care about your satisfaction, but they do
care about your money, and competition hitches their ability to satisfy
you to their ability to get paid by you. Competition has been circling
the drain for 40 years, as the “consumer welfare” theory of antitrust,
hatched by Reagan’s court sorcerers at the University of Chicago School
of Economics, took hold. This theory insists that monopolies are
evidence of “efficiency” – if everyone shops at one store, that’s
evidence that it’s the best store, not evidence that they’re cheating.
For 40 years, we’ve allowed companies to violate antitrust law by
merging with major competitors, acquiring fledgling rivals, and using
investor cash to sell below cost so that no one else can enter the
market. This has produced the inbred industrial hulks of today, with
five or fewer firms dominating everything from eyeglasses to banking,
sea freight to professional wrestling:
https://www.openmarketsinstitute.org/learn/monopoly-by-the-numbers The
endless and continuous weakening of competition has emboldened corporate
enshittifiers, who operate on the logic of Lily Tomlin in her role as an
AT&amp;T spokeswoman: “We don’t care. We don’t have to. We’re the phone
company”: https://vimeo.com/355556831 But the drawdown of competition
has also enabled regulatory capture, by converting cutthroat adversaries
to kissing cousins. These companies have convinced their regulators not
to enforce privacy, consumer protection or labor laws, provided that the
gross violations of these laws are accomplished via apps. This is where
tech exceptionalism is warranted: while the bosses that run these
companies aren’t any nobler – or more wicked – than the Robber Barons of
yore, they are equipped with a digital back-end for their businesses
that let them change the rules of the game from moment to moment. Think
of labor law: as Veena Dubal writes, gig-work companies practice
algorithmic wage discrimination, turning your paycheck into a slot
machine that pays out more when you are more selective about which jobs
you take, and which then docks your pay by tiny increments as you become
less discriminating about answering the app’s call:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/12/algorithmic-wage-discrimination/#fishers-of-men
This is a plain violation of labor law, but the fiction that gig workers
are contractors, combined with the opacity and speed of the wage
discrimination back-end, lets the companies get away with it. But the
monsters who hatched this scam are no worse than their forebears, nor
are they any smarter. Any black-hearted coal-boss memorialized in a
Tennessee Ernie Ford song would have gladly practiced algorithmic wage
discrimination – but there just weren’t enough green-eyeshade
accountants in the back office to change the payout from second to
second. I call this “twiddling” – turning the knobs on the back end to
continuously adjust the business logic that the firm operates on:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/twiddler/ Twiddling is everywhere,
and it is only possible because “it’s not a crime if we use an app” has
been accepted by (captured) regulators. Think of Amazon’s “pricing
paradox,” where deceptive search results – which Amazon makes $38b/year
on – allow the company to offer lower prices, but charge higher ones:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/06/attention-rents/#consumer-welfare-queens
The first constraint on enshittification is competition – the fear that
you’ll lose money when a disgusted customer take their business
elsewhere. The second constraint is regulation – the fear that a
regulator’s punishment will eat up all the expected gains from an
enshittificatory move, or even exceed those gains, leading to a net
loss. But the less competition there is in a sector, the easier it is
for the remaining companies to capture their regulators. Say goodbye to
that second constraint. But there’s another constraint – another one
that’s unique to technology, and genuinely exceptional. That’s
self-help. Digital technology is infinitely flexible, which is why
managers can twiddle the business logic and change the rules on a dime.
But it’s a double-edged sword. Users can twiddle back. The universal
nature of digital products means it’s always technically possible to
disenshittify the enshittified products in your world. Mercedes wants to
charge you rent on your accelerator pedal via a monthly subscription?
Just mod the car by toggling the “subscription paid” bit and get the
accelerator for free:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/24/rent-to-pwn/#kitt-is-a-demon HP
tricks you into installing a “security update” that sneakily disables
your printer’s ability to recognize and use third-party ink? Just roll
back the operating system and you won’t be forced to spend
$10,000/gallon to print out your boarding passes and shopping lists:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer
Self-help – AKA “adversarial interoperability” – isn’t just a way to
override the greedy choices of corporate sadists. It’s a way to hold
those sadists in check. It’s a constraint. Imagine a boardroom where
someone says, “I calculate that if we make our ads 25% more invasive and
obnoxious, we can eke out 2% more in ad-revenue.” If you think of a
business as a transhuman colony organism that exists to maximize
shareholder value, this is a no-brainer. But now consider the rejoinder:
“If we make our ads 25% more obnoxious, then 50% of our users will be
motivated to type, ‘how do I block ads?’ into a search engine. When that
happens, we don’t merely lose out on the expected 2% of additional
revenue – our income from those users falls to zero, forever.” Self-help
is the third constraint on enshittification. But when competition fails,
and regulatory capture ensues, companies don’t just gain the ability to
flout the law – they get to wield the law, too. Tech firms have
cultivated a thicket of laws, rules and regulations that make self-help
measures very illegal. This thicket is better known as “IP,” a term that
is best understood as meaning “any policy that lets me control the
conduct of my competitors, my customers and my critics”:
https://locusmag.com/2020/09/cory-doctorow-ip/ To put an ad-blocker in
an app, you have to reverse-engineer it. To do that, you’ll have to
decrypt and decompile it. That step is a felony under Section 1201 of
the DMCA, carrying a five-year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine.
Beyond that, ad-blocking an app would give rise to liability under the
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (a law inspired by the movie Wargames!),
under “tortious interference” claims, under trademark, copyright and
patent. More than 50% of web users have installed an ad-blocker:
https://doc.searls.com/2023/11/11/how-is-the-worlds-biggest-boycott-doing/
But zero percent of app users have installed an ad-blocker, because they
don’t exist, because you’d go to prison if you made one. An app is just
a web-page wrapped in enough IP to make it a felony to add an ad-blocker
to it. This is why self-help, the third constraint, no longer applies.
When a corporate sadist says, “let’s make ads 25% more obnoxious to get
2% more revenue,” no one says, “if we do that, our users will all
install blockers.” Instead, the response is, “let’s make ads 100% more
obnoxious and get an 8% revenue boost!”
https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/16/23763227/uber-video-advertising-ads-taxi-food-delivery-apps
Which brings me to the final constraint: workers. Tech workers have
historically enjoyed enormous bargaining power, thanks to a dire
shortage of qualified personnel. While this allowed tech workers to
command high salaries and cushy benefits, it also led many workers to
conceive of themselves as entrepreneurs-in-waiting and not workers at
all. This made tech workers very exploitable: their bosses could sell
them on the idea that they were doing something heroic, which warranted
“extremely hardcore” expectations – working 16 hour days, sleeping under
your desk, sacrificing your health, your family and your personal life
to meet deadlines and ship products (“Real artists ship” – S. Jobs). But
the flip side of this appeal to heroism is that it only worked to the
extent that it convinced workers to genuinely care about the things they
made. When you miss you mother’s funeral and pass on having kids in
order to meet deadline and ship a product, the prospect of making that
product worse is unthinkable. Confronted by the moral injury of
enshittifying a product you care about, and harming the users you see
yourself as representing, many tech workers balked at the prospect.
Because tech workers were scarce – and because there were plenty of
employment prospects for workers who quit – they could actually prevent
their bosses from making their products worse:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/25/moral-injury/#enshittification But
those days are behind us, too. Mass tech worker layoffs have gutted tech
workers’ confidence. When Google lays off 12,000 tech workers just
months after a stock buyback that would have paid their wages for the
next 27 years, they deliver two benefits to their shareholders. It’s not
just the short-term gains from the financial engineering – there’s the
long-term gain of gutting worker power and stripping away the final
impediment to enshittification:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/10/the-proletarianization-of-tech-workers/
No matter how strong an individual tech worker’s bargaining power was,
it was always brittle. Long before googlers were being laid off in
five-digit cohorts, they were working in an environment where harassment
and predation were just part of the job. The 20,000+ googlers who walked
off the job in 2018 were an important step towards replacing the system
where each tech worker’s power was limited to their moment-to-moment
importance to their bosses’ plans with a new system based on a
collective identity. Only through collective action and solidarity –
unions – could tech workers hope to truly resist all the moral injuries
of their bosses enshittification imperatives. No surprise then, that
tech unions are on the rise:
https://abookapart.com/products/you-deserve-a-tech-union But what is a
little surprising – and very heartening! – is what happens when techies
start to self-identify as workers: they come to understand that they
share common cause with the other workers at the bottom of the tech
stack. Think of Amazon’s tech workers walking out in solidarity with
Amazon’s warehouse workers:
https://gizmodo.com/tech-workers-speak-out-in-support-of-amazon-warehouse-s-1842839301
Superficially, the bottom rank of the tech industry is as different from
the tech workers at the top as you can imagine. Tech workers are
formally employed, with stock options, health care and theme-park
“campuses” with gyms and gourmet cafeterias. The gig workers who pack,
drive, deliver and support tech products aren’t even employees – they’re
misclassified as contractors. They don’t get free massages – they get AI
bosses that monitor their eyeballs and dock their paychecks for peeing:
https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/11/robots-stole-my-jerb/#computer-says-no
Gig workers desperately need unions, but they also derive extraordinary
benefits from self-help measures. When an app is your boss, another app
can make all the difference to your working conditions. Take Para, an
app that fights algorithmic wage discrimination by allowing gig workers
to collectively and automatically refuse any job where the pay is below
a certain threshold, forcing the algorithm to pay everyone more:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/tech-rights-are-workers-rights-doordash-edition
Para is fighting a grim legal and technical battle against companies
like Doordash, whose margins depend on atomized workers with atomized
apps, prohibited from countertwiddling. This is a surprisingly effective
tactic: in Indonesia, gig workers co-ops create suites of “tuyul” apps
that modify the behavior of their bosses’ apps’, unilaterally securing
concessions that they lack the bargaining power to secure by other
means: https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/08/tuyul-apps/#gojek Tuyul apps
and other forms of countertwiddling aren’t a substitute for
unionization, they’re an adjunct to it. The union negotiator whose
rank-and-file are able to modify the apps that monitor and control their
working conditions operates from a position of strength. “Please give my
members more bathroom breaks” is a lot weaker than, “If you want my
members to stop hacking their apps so they can piss when they need to,
you’re going to have to give them official bathroom breaks.” This is
where solidarity between the high-paid tech workers at the keyboard and
low-paid tech workers on the delivery bikes comes in. Together, they can
wring more concessions from their bosses, sure. But unionized coders can
give their unionized delivery riders the apps they need to
countertwiddle and increase the bargaining leverage of all the workers
in the union. And when unionized coders’ bosses force them to put
enshittifying anti-features in the apps they care about, unionized
front-line workers can run counter-apps that disenshittify them. Other
sectors are already working through versions of this. The ouster of the
old corrupt leadership of the Teamsters ushered in a new, radical era
that produced historic wage and working condition gains for drivers and
the abolition of the two-tier contract system that eventually destroys
any union that tries it. That change in leadership was possible because
the Teamsters organized the Harvard Grad Students, and those Harvard
kids memorized the union rulebook. At the historic conference where the
old guard was abolished, it was teamwork between the union rank-and-file
and the rules-lawyers from Harvard that turned the proceedings around:
https://theintercept.com/2023/04/07/deconstructed-union-dhl-teamsters-uaw/
We are deep into the enshittocene and it is terribly demoralizing. But
by understanding the constraints that kept enshittification at bay, we
can rebuild them, and shore them up. Labor organizing among all kinds of
tech workers isn’t just a way to get a better deal for those workers –
it’s key to the disenshittification of all our lives. Hey look at this

With the start of a new year, I thought it would be appropriate to

2024. Unfortunately, many of us are quick to express frustration with

Pastor David Hegg pretty much described himself while accusing others of

of “buying into” something that he has not validated/verified (i.e. I
once tried and I failed to verify the existence of God). But I can’t

to Remain From Estate of Heiress Considered Last Hawaiian Princess</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HONOLULU — In life, Abigail Kawananakoa embodied the complexities of
Hawaii: Many considered her a princess — a descendant of the royal
family that once ruled the islands.</p>
<p>But she was also the great-granddaughter of a sugar baron and
inherited vast wealth thanks to Westerners who upended traditional ways
of life through the introduction of private property and the diversion
of water for industrial plantations.</p>
<p>Now, more than a year after her death at age 96 and the bitter
battles over her fortune in the twilight of her life, her estate has
been settled. And recently finalized court documents show that after
doling out tens of millions to various people — including former
housekeepers, other longtime employees and her wife — there will be at
least $100 million left to support Native Hawaiian causes.</p>
<p>Kawananakoa cared deeply about advancing Hawaiian culture, and
resolving her estate is meaningful to Hawaiians because it is the last
of what’s known as “alii,” or royal, trusts, which were set up by
royalty to benefit Native Hawaiians, said Dr. Naleen Naupaka Andrade,
executive vice president of Native Hawaiian health for The Queen’s
Health System. The health system was created from a trust established by
Queen Emma in 1859.</p>
<p>“Quite frankly, the needs of Hawaiians in education, in social
welfare, in housing, in health far exceed the capacity of these trusts,”
she said. “They augment what federal and state dollars should be doing
for Hawaii’s Indigenous peoples.”</p>
<p>Fate of foundation</p>
<p>Many have been watching where the money ends up because of concerns
about the fate of the foundation Kawananakoa set up to benefit
Hawaiians. Kawananakoa’s trust will perpetuate Native Hawaiian culture
and language, Andrade said.</p>
<p>According to documents in the probate case for her estate, $40
million will go to her wife. Settlements have also been reached with
about a dozen other people who had claims, including someone described
in court documents as her “hanai” son, referring to an informal adoption
in Hawaiian culture.</p>
<p>Legal wrangling over Kawananakoa’s trust, which now has a value of at
least $250 million, began in 2017 after she suffered a stroke. She
disputed claims that she was impaired, and married Veronica Gail Worth,
her partner of 20 years, who later changed her name to Veronica Gail
Kawananakoa.</p>
<p>In 2020, a judge ruled that Abigail Kawananakoa was, in fact,
impaired, and thus unable to manage her property and business affairs.
The estate has been overseen by a trustee.</p>
<p>She inherited her wealth as the great-granddaughter of James
Campbell, an Irish businessman who made his fortune as a sugar
plantation owner and one of Hawaii’s largest landowners. She held no
formal title but was a living reminder of Hawaii’s monarchy and a symbol
of Hawaiian national identity that endured after the kingdom was
overthrown by American businessmen in 1893.</p>
<p>Over the years, some insisted Kawananakoa was held up as royalty only
because of her wealth. They disputed her princess claim, saying that had
the monarchy survived, a cousin would be in line to be the ruler, not
her.</p>
<p>Her causes</p>
<p>She put her money toward various causes, including scholarships,
medical bills and funerals for Native Hawaiians. She supported protests
against a giant telescope because of its proposed placement on Mauna
Kea, a sacred mountain in Hawaiian culture; donated items owned by King
Kalakaua and Queen Kapiʻolani for public display, including a 14-carat
diamond from the king’s pinky ring; and maintained ʻIolani Palace —
America’s only royal residence, where the Hawaiian monarchy dwelled, and
which now serves mostly as a museum.</p>
<p>“Historically significant items” belonging to Kawananakoa will be
delivered to the palace, said a statement issued by trustee Jim Wright
on behalf of her foundation.</p>
<p>Her trust has been supporting causes dear to her, including
programming at the palace such as night tours and cultural dinners, and
paying for students at Hawaiian-focused schools to visit cultural sites
and experience symphony performances in Hawaiian, Wright said.</p>
<p>After Internal Revenue Service clearance, the foundation will receive
the leftover money, which Wright estimated to be at least $100 million,
to fund similar efforts.</p>
<p>Kauikeolani Nani’ole, an educator at Halau Ku Mana Public Charter
School in Honolulu, said her school recently received money from the
trust for busing to community events.</p>
<p>“In those small ways, they make big impacts for schools like us,” she
said.</p>
<p>She called Kawananakoa an “unsung alii” because she often donated to
causes and people anonymously.</p>
<p>Fostering culture</p>
<p>According to documents establishing her foundation in 2001,
Kawananakoa wanted it to “maintain, support, preserve and foster the
traditional Hawaiian culture in existence prior to 1778” — the year the
first European explorer, Captain James Cook, reached the islands. That
includes Hawaiian music, religion, language and art.</p>
<p>Andrade recently visited Kawananakoa’s crypt at Mauna ʻAla, also
known as the Royal Mausoleum State Monument, which is the burial place
of Hawaiian royalty. She laid an offering of maile leaves entwined with
white ginger — a flower Kawananakoa loved.</p>
<p>“All of the pilikia, all of the trouble, that occurred in the last
several years after she became ill — what was lost in all that was her
love of her people,” Andrade said. “Her deep, deep love and the
thoughtfulness she had, and the foresight she had before she became ill
about wanting to leave a legacy for her people that could make a
difference.”</p>

airstrikes late Thursday.</p>
<p>U.S. Central Command said it launched the additional strike from the
USS Carney, a guided missile destroyer, firing multiple Tomahawk Land
Attack Missiles to take out a radar site that it said presented a
continuing threat to maritime traffic.</p>
<p>The strike comes a little more than a day after the U.S. and British
militaries carried out dozens of strikes against Houthi positions in
Yemen, in retaliation for weeks of Houthi attacks that have disrupted
shipping and damaged vessels transiting the Red Sea and Gulf of
Aden.</p>
<p>Houthi militants did launch an anti-ship ballistic missile early
Friday, U.S. military officials confirmed, though it did not hit any
ships.</p>
<p>U.S. and British officials expressed optimism Friday that the
initial strikes late Thursday, which are now being described as two
waves of strikes, were successful.</p>
<p>A U.S. defense official told VOA on Friday that the
initial assessment indicates the first wave of precision strikes late
Thursday degraded the ability of the Houthis to launch further
attacks.</p>
<p>The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to
discuss operational details, said a more comprehensive assessment of the
strikes was still underway. But the sentiment echoed other early
assessments by senior U.S. officials, who have described the damage to
Houthi capabilities as “significant.” </p>
<p>“We feel very confident about where our munitions struck,” Lieutenant
General Douglas Sims, the director of the Joint Staff, told reporters
Friday. “But we don’t know at this point the complete battle damage
assessment.”</p>
<p>U.S. Central Command late Thursday said that U.S. fighter jets, naval
vessels and submarines hit more than 60 targets at 16 locations across
Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen, including command and control nodes,
munitions depots, launching systems, and production facilities.</p>
<p>But Sims said Friday, the U.S. and Britain launched a second wave of
strikes against another 12 locations 30 minutes to an hour after the
initial strikes were carried out.</p>
<p>The additional sites, each with multiple targets, “had been
identified as possessing articles that could be potentially used against
forces, maritime and air,” he said, noting the strikes were taken in
self-defense.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said, in all, more than 150 precision guided munitions
were aimed at Houthi targets, including Tomahawk missiles.</p>
<p>At least three U.S. guided missile cruisers and destroyers (the USS
Gravely, the USS Philippine Sea, and the USS Mason) took part in the
strikes along with an Ohio-class submarine, fighter jets from the USS
Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier, and U.S. Air Force jets.</p>
<p>A separate statement Friday from the British Defense Ministry said
four of its Typhoon fighter jets, accompanied by an air refueling
tanker, used laser-guided bombs to hit two locations: a drone launch
site in Bani, in northwestern Yemen, and an airfield in Abbs, used to
launch cruise missiles and drones at ships in the Red Sea.</p>
<p>“Early indications are that the Houthis’ ability to threaten merchant
shipping has taken a blow,” the ministry said.</p>
<p>Despite the optimistic strike assessments, U.S. officials have said
they believe the Houthis are likely to retaliate.</p>
<p>“My guess is that the Houthis are trying to figure things out on the
ground and trying to determine what capabilities still exist for them,”
Sims said. “Their rhetoric has been pretty strong and pretty high, and I
would expect that they will attempt some sort of retaliation.”</p>
<p>“I would hope they wouldn’t,” he added, describing the Houthi efforts
as “generally fruitless.”</p>
<p>But the White House repeated its warning Friday that the Houthis
would face additional consequences if their attacks persist.</p>
<p>“We will make sure that we respond to the Houthis if they continue
this outrageous behavior, along with our allies,” President Joe Biden
said in response to reporters’ questions during a stop at a coffee shop
in Pennsylvania on Friday.</p>
<p>Also Friday, the U.S. unveiled new sanctions aimed at commodity
shipments that have been funding the Houthis and their Iranian
backers.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Department officials imposed sanctions on a
Hong-Kong-based company and another company in the United Arab Emirates,
both of which have been working with Sa’id al-Jamal, a financier who has
been supporting both the Houthis and Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard
Corps Quds Force.</p>
<p>“We will take all available measures to stop the destabilizing
activities of the Houthis and their threats to global commerce,”
Treasury Undersecretary Brian Nelson said in a statement.</p>
<p>Since mid-November, the Houthis have launched at least 28
attacks, affecting citizens, cargo and vessels from more than 50
countries, according to the U.S.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have said that Biden made the decision to launch
Thursday’s strikes following a Houthi attack on shipping lanes in the
Red Sea and Gulf of Aden on Tuesday that involved 18 one-way attack
drones, two cruise missiles and one ballistic missile.</p>
<p>U.S. combat jets, along with U.S. and British military vessels,
responded by shooting down the drones and missiles, averting any damage
to ships or injuries to their crews in the area.</p>
<p>Last week, the United States and 12 allies issued a statement warning
the Houthis of unspecified consequences if their attacks on shipping in
the Red Sea continued.</p>
<p>The statement followed the launch in mid-December of Operation
Prosperity Guardian by the United States, Britain and nearly 20 other
countries to protect ships from Houthi attacks.</p>
<p>Since the launch of Prosperity Guardian, at least 1,500 vessels have
passed safely through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which connects the Red
Sea with the Gulf of Aden.</p>
<p>The U.N. Security Council adopted its own resolution Wednesday,
calling on the Houthis to stop the attacks immediately.</p>
<p>But Russia, which abstained in the vote, called for an emergency
meeting of the council Friday evening to discuss the strikes. Ambassador
Vassily Nebenzia called the U.S.-British strikes a “blatant armed
aggression against another country.” He argued that the strikes did not
meet the conditions for self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N.
Charter.</p>
<p>“Article 51 does not apply to the situation with commercial
shipping,” Nebenzia said. “The right to self-defense cannot be exercised
in order to ensure the freedom of shipping. Our American colleagues know
this fact very well.”</p>
<p>In a statement Friday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said
attacks against international shipping in the Red Sea area are “not
acceptable” and endanger the safety and security of global supply chains
and have a negative impact on the economic and humanitarian situation
worldwide. He urged the Houthis to immediately cease their attacks and
called for all parties to respect the Security Council resolution in its
entirety.</p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the Council that the
strikes were consistent with international law and Article 51. She said
Washington does not take such strikes lightly and they were only carried
out “after non-military options proved inadequate to address the
threat.”</p>

<p>Last week, after President Joe Biden went to Valley Forge and then
spoke in Pennsylvania, I got a chance to sit down with him to ask a few
questions. What I wanted to hear from him illustrates the difference
between journalists and historians. Journalists are trained to find
breaking stories and to explain them clearly so that their audience is
better informed about what is happening in the world. What they do is
vitally important to a democracy, and it is hard work. One of the
reasons I always try to call out the names of journalists whose articles
I’m describing is to highlight that there are real people working hard
to dig out the stories we all need to know and that we are all part of a
community trying together to figure out what’s happening in this
country.</p>

Ordered to Pay Legal Fees of New York Times, Three Reporters</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — Former President Donald Trump was ordered Friday to pay
nearly $400,000 in legal fees to The New York Times and three
investigative reporters after he sued them unsuccessfully over a
Pulitzer Prize-winning 2018 story about his family’s wealth and tax
practices.</p>
<p>The newspaper and reporters Susanne Craig, David Barstow and Russell
Buettner were dismissed from the lawsuit in May. Trump’s claim against
his estranged niece, Mary Trump, that she breached a prior settlement
agreement by giving tax records to the reporters is still pending.</p>
<p>New York Judge Robert Reed said that given the “complexity of the
issues” in the case and other factors, it was reasonable that Donald
Trump be forced to pay lawyers for the Times and the reporters a total
of $392,638 in legal fees.</p>
<p>“Today’s decision shows that the state’s newly amended anti-SLAPP
statute can be a powerful force for protecting press freedom,” Times
spokesperson Danielle Rhoads Ha said, referring to a New York law that
bars baseless lawsuits designed to silence critics. Such lawsuits are
known as SLAPPs or strategic lawsuits against public participation.</p>
<p>“The court has sent a message to those who want to misuse the
judicial system to try to silence journalists,” Rhoads Ha said.</p>
<p>Trump’s niece</p>
<p>In a separate ruling Friday, Reed denied a request by Mary Trump –
now the sole defendant – that the case be put on hold while she appeals
his June decision that allowed Donald Trump’s claim against her to
proceed.</p>
<p>Mary Trump’s lawyers declined to comment.</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s lawyer, Alina Habba, said they remained disappointed
that the Times and its reporters were dropped from the case. She said
they were pleased that the court had “once again affirmed the strength
of our claims against Mary and is denying her attempt to avoid
accountability.”</p>
<p>“We look forward to proceeding with our claims against her,” Habba
said.</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s lawsuit, filed in 2021, accused the Times and its
reporters of relentlessly seeking out Mary Trump as a source of
information and persuading her to turn over confidential tax records. He
contended that the reporters were aware her prior settlement agreement
barred her from disclosing the documents, which she’d received in a
dispute over family patriarch Fred Trump’s estate.</p>
<p>The Times’ reporting challenged Donald Trump’s claims of self-made
wealth by documenting how his father, Fred Trump, had given him at least
$413 million over the decades, including through tax avoidance schemes.
Mary Trump identified herself in a book published in 2020 as the source
of the documents.</p>
<p>The Times’ story said that Donald Trump and his father avoided gift
and inheritance taxes by methods including setting up a sham corporation
and undervaluing assets to tax authorities. The Times said its report
was based on more than 100,000 pages of financial documents, including
confidential tax returns for the father and his companies.</p>
<p>‘Personal vendetta’</p>
<p>Donald Trump, who sought $100 million in damages, alleged Mary Trump,
the Times and the reporters “were motivated by a personal vendetta”
against him. He accused them of engaging “in an insidious plot to obtain
confidential and highly sensitive records which they exploited for their
own benefit.”</p>
<p>In dismissing the Times and its reporters from the lawsuit, Reed
wrote that legal news gathering is “at the very core of protected First
Amendment activity.”</p>
<p>Mary Trump, 58, is the daughter of Donald Trump’s brother, Fred Trump
Jr., who died in 1981 at age 42. She is an outspoken critic of her
uncle, whom she has regarded as “criminal, cruel and traitorous.”</p>
<p>In July, Mary Trump filed a counterclaim against Donald Trump under
New York’s anti-SLAPP law, arguing that Donald Trump’s lawsuit was
“purely retaliatory and lacking in merit” and intended to “chill her and
others from criticizing him in the future.”</p>

Asks Court to Intervene Over Texas Blocking US Border Agents</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>McALLEN, Texas — The Justice Department on Friday asked the Supreme
Court to order Texas to stop blocking Border Patrol agents from a
portion of the U.S.-Mexico border where large numbers of migrants have
crossed in recent months, setting up another showdown between Republican
Governor Greg Abbott and the Biden administration over immigration
enforcement.</p>
<p>The request comes after Texas put up fencing to take control of a
nearly 20-hectare public park along the Rio Grande in Eagle Pass, which
was a crossing point for thousands of migrants entering from Mexico last
year. Although a similar power struggle played out in the same region
more than a year ago, the area Texas closed off this week prevents
federal agents from accessing a larger and more visible crossing
spot.</p>
<p>Along one stretch, armed Texas National Guard members and their
vehicles are preventing Border Patrol agents from accessing the river,
the Justice Department said in a court filing. The Texas National Guard
also allegedly used a military Humvee to keep Border Patrol agents off
an access road.</p>
<p>“Because Border Patrol can no longer access or view this stretch of
the border, Texas has effectively prevented Border Patrol from
monitoring the border,” the Justice Department wrote in a filing.</p>
<p>Abbott told reporters that Texas has the authority to control access
to any geographic location in the state.</p>
<p>“That authority is being asserted,” Abbott said.</p>
<p>The closure of Shelby Park was an escalation of the governor’s border
enforcement efforts known as Operation Lone Star. The state and federal
government are involved in multiple legal disputes over actions Texas
has taken since 2023, including the use of buoys in the middle of the
international river, the installment of razor wire, and an upcoming law
that will allow police to arrest migrants.</p>
<p>Abbott defended closing off the park as he faced backlash from
Democrats for telling conservative radio host Dana Loesch last week that
Texas has done everything to curb illegal crossings short of shooting
people. Loesch had asked Abbott how far Texas could go on the border
before someone might arrest him.</p>
<p>“The only thing that we’re not doing is we’re not shooting people who
come across the border because of course the Biden administration would
charge us with murder,” he said as he discussed a New York City lawsuit
against charter bus companies that he has used to transport migrants
from Texas.</p>
<p>Mexico’s foreign relations secretary denounced Abbott’s comments,
saying they could lead to violence and are dehumanizing to migrants.</p>
<p>On Friday, Abbott said he was making a distinction of what Texas can
and cannot do on the border. “I was asked to point out where the line is
drawn about what would be illegal and I pointed out something that is
obviously illegal,” he said.</p>
<p>Texas notified the Eagle Pass government on Wednesday that the
Department of Public Safety would be closing public access to Shelby
Park.</p>
<p>Concern grew when Border Patrol noted it, too, lost access to the
park, which agents use to launch boats into the Rio Grande. The area
also served as a staging area where federal officers would take migrants
into custody and process them. The Border Patrol’s access to the site
for surveillance was similarly curtailed.</p>
<p>The Justice Department’s emergency request to the Supreme Court says
agents no longer have access to a 4-kilometer stretch of the border in
the region. The filing was made as part of the U.S. government’s lawsuit
over the concertina wire the state installed along roughly 48 kilometers
near Eagle Pass.</p>
<p>The union for Border Patrol agents, the National Border Patrol
Council, praised the state’s move.</p>
<p>“By taking control of an area where so many illegal aliens are simply
surrendering, he’s freeing up BP agents to patrol areas with high
numbers of illegal aliens who attempt to escape arrest,” the union said
in a message on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>
<p>In 2022, a Texas pecan farm got caught in a similar dispute between
Abbott and the Biden administration when the Texas Department of Public
Safety moved in without the landowner’s consent and revoked a lease
between the landowner and Border Patrol.</p>
<p>The state’s policies have been called into question not only by
outside critics but internally when a trooper’s account over denying
water and urgent medical care made headlines in July.</p>

<p>
An ‘Old Millennial’ cracks the code of TikTok, discovering ludicrous
concepts — like “Give Israel to Hamas” — with no adults in the room, but
trying to ignore the online chatter is a non-starter because then the
mainstream loses any legitimacy.

id="apple-airdrop-leaks-user-data-like-a-sieve.-chinese-authorities-say-theyre-scooping-it-up.">Apple
AirDrop leaks user data like a sieve. Chinese authorities say they’re
scooping it up.</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Chinese authorities recently said they’re using an advanced
encryption attack to de-anonymize users of AirDrop in an effort to crack
down on citizens who use the Apple file-sharing feature to
mass-distribute content that’s outlawed in that country. According to a
2022 report from The New York Times, activists have used AirDrop to
distribute scathing critiques of the Communist Party of China to nearby
iPhone users in subway trains and stations and other public venues. A
document one protester sent in October of that year called General
Secretary Xi Jinping a “despotic traitor.” A few months later, with the
release of iOS 16.1.1, the AirDrop users in China found that the
“everyone” configuration, the setting that makes files available to all
other users nearby, automatically reset to the more contacts-only
setting. Apple has yet to acknowledge the move. Critics continue to see
it as a concession Apple CEO Tim Cook made to Chinese authorities. ↫ Dan
Goodin at Ars Technica The most damning aspect of this story is that
Apple has been aware of this vulnerability in AirDrop since 2019, and
has not addressed it in any way. The use of AirDrop by dissidents in
China to spread critique of the Chinese government has been well-known,
so it’s not entirely unreasonable to conclude that Apple has been weary
of closing this security vulnerability in order to not offend China – as
further evidenced by the sudden changes to AirDrop as mentioned above.
What’s going to be interesting now is what Apple is going to do about
this. Are they going to finally address this security hole, and thereby
risking offending China? Will it fix the hole, but only in
non-totalitarian countries? Will it just leave it open? Whatever they
do, they’ll end up offending someone.</p>

Impulse Labs debuted its much anticipated induction stove at the
Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week. Coming to grips with
this high-tech culinary wonder is a little bit like that meme of an
<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/galaxy-brain" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expanding
brain</a>.
</p>
<p>
At first glance,
the<a href="https://www.impulselabs.com//#Product" target="_blank">
Impulse Cooktop</a> is just a sexy-looking, $5,999 appliance: sleek
black glass, burners that resemble a DJ turntable, knobs that add a
satisfying analog touch to an otherwise fully digital interface.
</p>
<p>
But then you learn it also has integrated temperature sensors that keep
the burners at the precise temperature you want.
</p>
<p>
And then you learn that the stove has a battery in it, which means that
unlike most other induction stoves, it can plug into a standard 120-volt
outlet. You don’t have to get a pricy circuit upgrade, or an even
pricier electrical panel upgrade, to install it.
</p>
<p>
Plus, the battery delivers enough power to boil a liter of water in 40
seconds. And you can still cook if the power goes out. And
<a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/residential-clean-energy-credit" target="_blank">its
eligible for a 30% tax credit</a> .
</p>
<p>
And then, your brain explodes when you learn the battery is a smart
energy storage device that can charge up when power is cheap in the
morning so that you save money when you use it in the evening, when
power prices are highest. You can also participate in programs that will
pay you to dispatch power from your stove to the grid when demand is
high.
</p>
<p>
Who knew a stove could, or should, do so much?

<p>
I caught up with Sam D’Amico, the mastermind behind
<a href="https://www.impulselabs.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Impulse
Labs</a>, while he was at CES, to learn more about the story behind the
stove. We talked about pizza, why induction cooking is the wedge to
getting whole homes off gas, and his vision for putting a battery in
every appliance. Our conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What’s your background? What were you up to before founding
Impulse?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I graduated Stanford in 2012. In 2013 I got my masters. When I was
there, I was on the solar car team and actually wrote battery management
firmware as part of that. That gave me my first taste in
electrification. You had to build a full EV and drive it across
Australia. Then I immediately got sucked into consumer electronics and
worked on a number of devices, including Google Glass, Oculus.
</p>
<p>
Part of the thesis for Impulse is, home appliances really haven’t seen a
lot of innovation in 50 years or so. There’s been a number of advances
in consumer electronics, so being able to take a lot of the talent and
supply chain and experience from that and apply it to the appliance
space is underleveraged.
</p>
<p>
<strong>You were working on all these computer electronics, and then
somehow you got interested in stoves. I understand it had something to
do with making the perfect pizza. Could you tell me that story?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I was in Japan at a conference, and we went to this pizza place and they
cooked my pizza in like 45 seconds. And I’m like, that is insane. I
think it’s called Savoy Pizza, you should definitely go to it. Tastiest
pizza I’ve ever had. Super memorable. And then I’m like, I want to do
that. But can I make it a tabletop device in my house?
</p>
<p>
And so I was getting obsessive with how to replicate that, but I
realized you couldn’t do it on a 120-volt plug. I basically realized you
had to put a battery in the appliance to be able to boost the power
above what a 120 volt provides. All of the oven and smart appliance
companies were really focused on AI and computer vision at that time,
because they couldn’t innovate on the performance characteristics — they
were topped out. And I realized this was an end run around that. You
could actually make something that was three times better on the
performance side, not have to worry about AI features that maybe no one
is going to use, and really do some innovation.
</p>
<p>
That started me thinking about the bigger picture. I realized you could
use that storage for the building. And then that kind of expanded into
what became Impulse.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Did you figure out how to cook a pizza in 45 seconds?</strong>
</p>
<p>
So the first product is a cooktop. The idea here was we realized that
the key appliance to getting gas out of the home was the stove. People
don’t know what the fuel source is for all of their other appliances,
including ovens. The big thing with gas stoves is that the user
experience is the flame. So being able to address that, we thought, was
fundamental to building decarbonization.
</p>
<p>
Utility companies know this. They know that getting people to get a gas
stove is the way to get them off electric heat and on to gas heat. The
wedge is actually the gas stove. So by producing an appliance that is
just way more compelling, we can sever that dependency.
</p>
<p>
When we do an oven, I think we will have that pizza feature. I think the
ballpark of performance of around 45 seconds is possible.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What was the process like of testing stoves and trying to figure
out what the perfect stove is?</strong>
</p>
<p>
That was the fun part. We started buying hot plates and stoves and
tearing them down. We basically realized that a lot of this stuff just
hadn’t been attempted because the power wasn’t available. So the first
thing we did was try to crank a ton of power into the stove. So we were
like, let’s do 10 kilowatts, because 10 is a big number. That let us
boil a liter of water in 40 seconds. We had that demo working in March
or April of 2022.
</p>
<p>
But we realized immediately that this was too much performance unless
you could solve the controls problem. The reason why people complain
about warped pans and various other things is because the stove gets too
hot. We then started tearing down all the hot plates and stoves we could
find that had temperature sensors in them, and we realized that no one’s
actually addressed this, and we found that there was a lot of leverage
there that let us unlock the full performance of the stove. And so we’re
monitoring the temperature in real time, making sure that we’re
delivering the appropriate amount of power for the level you want to
set, so that it holds a specific temperature.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you need to use your stove all day, like for cooking a whole
Thanksgiving dinner, is that possible with this? Or will the battery
drain and then you can’t use it for a little bit?</strong>
</p>
<p>
You’re going to be okay, yes. You’ll drain the battery if you’re, let’s
say, boiling a big pot of water for pasta. But then once it’s at
temperature, you’re not going to be drawing more than what a 120-volt
plug would draw. Maybe you’re stir-frying something. That pan, when it’s
heating up, maybe it’s drawing a couple kilowatts for a minute, but then
once everything’s up to temperature, you’re drawing hundreds of watts,
and the battery is charging.
</p>
<p>
So basically, the average power draw [when you cook] is appropriate for
even a 120-volt plug. It’s just that the peak power is more like an EV
charger, or like an electric radiant heater, or something crazy. And
that mismatch between peak and average is where the opportunity for
putting batteries in appliances really shines.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The battery is like a quarter of a Tesla Powerwall. How valuable
can that be for the grid?</strong>
</p>
<p>
There’s a couple of ways to weigh how valuable that is. In Southern
California, which has really strong time-of-use energy rates, in the 4
to 9 pm slot, [using electricity during] that peak window is like 20
cents more expensive per kilowatt-hour than outside that window. So if
you charge the battery outside the window and then you discharge the
battery, whether it’s cooking or it’s putting power back into the house,
inside that window, it’s worth hundreds of dollars a year in terms of
energy bill savings.
</p>
<p>
We’ve got a full computer in there. It will basically pull those rate
tables and make those choices semi-autonomously. We’re likely going to
expose some level of choice to the end user, but we haven’t finalized
the design.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What’s your pitch to the average consumer? How do you get people
interested in having batteries in their appliances?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I think there’s a very direct pitch, which is, we are making the best
possible appliances. It will make you a better cook. You will be able to
do things faster and more efficiently.
</p>
<p>
Two is, you will be like, “I want to get an induction stove, I heard
that’s a good thing to get.” And then your electricians will come by and
tell you that you only have 10 amps available on your electric panel,
and you’re going to be sad. And so we also solve that problem.
</p>
<p>
And then the third one is, now we’ve put some energy storage in your
house. There’s 140 million homes in America. If we can intercept three
major appliances per home, or four major appliances per home, that’s
like 1.4 terawatt-hours of storage deployment potential. There’s an
opportunity to deploy storage every year just by people upgrading their
appliances. And so that’s part of the end game. Utilities will like that
because it means they don’t have to invest in all this expensive
transmission infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Do you want to make other products besides stoves?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Yeah. We want to make the best appliances across the board. There’s a
number of logical options, anything that has high peak but low average
draw is the low hanging fruit. So you can imagine ovens — they draw
power when they pre-heat. Water heaters are another one, where it’s
like, if you’re taking a shower, it consumes a ton of power, but when
you’re not, it doesn’t. Laundry is another one. I also want to emphasize
that we’re making relatively high-end, premium appliances to start, but
this architecture scales down fairly well to mid-range products. It’s
just that as a startup, just as Tesla started with sports cars, we have
to kind of start with the lower-volume, higher-margin products and then
scale up from there.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How do people get one?</strong>
</p>
<p>
You can preorder it today on ImpulseLabs.com. There’s about 45% in
federal discounts available. Because this thing has a battery and an
inverter, it’s an energy storage product. It gets a 30% investment tax
credit. A big change under the IRA was that stationary batteries, sold
separately from solar, get that credit now. And then there’s also an
$840 electric stove rebate that is available under the IRA. That one is
income gated and expected to roll out in the fall. Our products are
going to be available in Q4, so we expect the timing to be appropriate
where all those rebates and credits will be available.

id="judges-in-ny-dc-trump-cases-are-latest-targets-in-swatting-surge">Judges
in NY, DC Trump Cases Are Latest Targets in ‘Swatting’ Surge</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ATLANTA — Bomb threats and false reports of shootings at the homes of
public officials, state capitols and courthouses have surged in recent
weeks, including some connected to court cases against former President
Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The judges overseeing the civil fraud case against Trump in New York
and the criminal election subversion case against him in Washington,
D.C., have both been targeted in recent days. Also, Justice Department
special counsel Jack Smith was the subject of a fake emergency call
Christmas Day.</p>
<p>A series of public officials from across the political spectrum were
targeted by swatting over the holidays, and capitol buildings and
courthouses in states across the U.S. were locked down and evacuated
last week after receiving bomb threats. No explosives were found, and no
one was hurt.</p>
<p>The FBI said Thursday that investigators have seen a widespread
increase in threats of violence and take them seriously. “When the
threats are made as a hoax, it puts innocent people at risk, is a waste
of law enforcement’s limited resources and costs taxpayers,” the agency
said in a statement. </p>
<p>Here’s a look at the spike in threats: </p>
<p>What is ‘swatting’?</p>
<p>Swatting is the act of making a prank call to emergency services to
prompt a response at a particular address. The goal is to get
authorities, particularly a special weapons and tactics (SWAT) team, to
show up.</p>
<p>Some of the recent calls have featured the voice of a man calling
himself “Jamal,” claiming he had shot his wife because she was sleeping
with another man and saying he was holding the boyfriend hostage,
demanding $10,000.</p>
<p>Who in the courts has been targeted?</p>
<p>In New York, authorities responded to a bomb threat at the Long
Island home of Judge Arthur Engoron early Thursday morning, the day
after the judge issued a ruling preventing the former president from
delivering his own closing statements in the civil fraud case against
him. Nothing amiss was found. </p>
<p>The false report came days after a fake emergency call reporting a
shooting at the home of U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is
overseeing Trump’s Capitol attack criminal case in Washington, D.C. </p>
<p>Smith was also the target of fake shooting report at his home, a
person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press. The person
spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the investigation. Smith
and his family have been the subject of numerous threats and
intimidating messages since he was appointed and Trump began posting
messages about them online, prosecutors have said in court
documents. </p>
<p>What other public officials have been targeted?</p>
<p>Public officials targeted by swatting range from Republican U.S.
Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia to Maine Secretary of
State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat who removed Trump from the state’s
presidential primary ballot under the Constitution’s insurrection
clause. </p>
<p>Other high-profile targets in recent days include U.S. Senator Rick
Scott of Florida, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and Ohio Attorney General
Dave Yost. </p>
<p>In Greene’s case, a man called the Georgia suicide hotline Christmas
morning, claiming that he had shot his girlfriend at Greene’s home and
was going to kill himself next, police said. The call was quickly
transferred to police, who determined it was a swatting attempt after
contacting a private security detail for Greene, who has been targeted
multiple times. </p>
<p>In Wu’s case, a male caller on the same day claimed he had shot his
wife and had tied her and another man up at the Boston mayor’s address.
Wu, a Democrat, has also been targeted by many swatting calls since she
took office in 2021. </p>
<p>How widespread is the problem?</p>
<p>Hundreds of cases of swatting occur annually, with some using caller
ID spoofing to disguise their number. And those targeted extend far
beyond public officials. </p>
<p>Police have for months reported a huge surge in fake claims about
active shooters at schools and colleges. There have also been reports of
hundreds of swatting incidents and bomb threats against synagogues and
other Jewish institutions since the Israel-Hamas war began. </p>
<p>The FBI said earlier this year that it had begun to create a database
to track swatting incidents nationwide.</p>
<p>Do false threats pose other risks?</p>
<p>Such calls have proven dangerous, even deadly. </p>
<p>In 2017, a police officer in Wichita, Kansas, shot and killed a man
while responding to a hoax emergency call. Earlier this year, the city
agreed to pay $5 million to settle a related lawsuit, with the money to
go to the two children of Andrew Finch, 28. </p>
<p>In 2015, police in Maryland shot a 20-year-old man in the face with
rubber bullets after a fake hostage situation was reported at his
home. </p>
<p>In addition to putting innocent people at risk, police and officials
say they worry about diverting resources from real emergencies. </p>
<p>What kind of response could this prompt?</p>
<p>No arrests have been made in the recent threats, but some lawmakers
have moved for heftier penalties. </p>
<p>Ohio earlier this year made it a felony offense to report a false
emergency that prompts response by law enforcement. And Virginia
increased the penalties for swatting to up to 12 months in jail. Similar
bills are pending in other states and Congress. </p>
<p>In Georgia, Lieutenant Governor Burt Jones promised “an end to this
madness” after his home in a small town south of Atlanta was swatted on
Wednesday, only to have a bomb threat called in to his office on
Thursday. </p>
<p>“Let me be clear — I will not be intimidated by those attempting to
silence me,” Jones wrote on social media platform X.</p>

gathering – 20th January</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-12, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>It’s time to for anyone interested in RISC OS programming to get the
fire (or other heat source) going again, and gather around the computer
for another friendly fireside chat. The next one takes place on 20th
January, 2024 – next Saturday. Kicking off at 7:30pm, the meeting will
as usual be held online using the Zoom video conferencing system, which
means that as long as you have that running on a computer or other
device, you can join in from wherever you are. The aim of these fireside
chats…</p>

brings ‘sender’ setting</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-12, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>The main commercial email client for RISC OS is Messenger Pro from
R-Comp, and the company has just released version 9.01 – a very small
increment in its version number (Messenger Pro 9 was released in the run
up to the 2022 Wradfold Show; Wakefield, but in Bradford), but a change
that may be quite important for some users. The main reason for the
small increment is an addition to the settings, whereby any given user
can now specify what should be used for the “Sender”. Setting this
header correctly…</p>

8%</a> of the world’s oil and gas. Because of its pivotal location
between the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal — and
thus the Red Sea, which feeds into the canal — connects the huge flow of
goods and commodities from the Middle East and Asia to Europe.
</p>
<p>
On Thursday,
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/02/israel-gaza-war-risk-wider-conflict-us-iran-houthi-ships-red-sea" target="_blank">conflict
in the Red Sea</a> and its surrounding waterways reached a new pitch,
with United States and allied forces
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/11/politics/us-strikes-houthis-yemen/index.html" target="_blank">striking
several targets</a> in Yemen as a response to weeks of attacks on
shipping and naval assets in the area. The Houthis, a rebel group backed
by Iran that controls large portions of the country, including the
capital, have justified their attack as a response to Israeli strikes in
the Gaza Strip.
</p>
<p>
So far, according to market researcher Rory Johnston, author of the
<em>Commodity Context </em>newsletter, the effect on the global oil
market has been muted.
</p>
<p>
Some oil tankers rerouted away from the Red Sea,
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/oil-tankers-divert-red-sea-after-us-uk-strikes-yemen-2024-01-12/" target="_blank">according
to <em>Reuters</em></a>; of the roughly 2,000 ships diverted in total,
Johnston said, “only a few dozen have been tankers,” although that
number rose Friday morning. While oil prices
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/011124-oil-futures-crude-rallies-at-open-as-us-uk-launch-strikes-against-houthis" target="_blank">jumped</a>
around 3% early Friday,
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">they
have since gone roughly flat on the day</a>. So far, missiles from Yemen
“had a narrow miss” with a Russian oil tanker in the Gulf of Aden,
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-12/houthis-fire-missile-400-meters-from-russian-oil-carrier?utm_source=twitter&utm_content=middleeast&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_medium=social&sref=f2E6A62x" target="_blank"><em>Bloomberg</em>
reported</a>.
</p>
<p>
“This’ll be the test, but I don’t yet have any reason to believe that it
will be a material factor for oil markets,” Johnston told me. “[The]
ultimate question will be how the Houthis respond.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
The Houthi attacks have been going on for
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/yemen-navy-warship-missiles-intercepted-2f5fc9c8a3737f762b29d5c53ec08a5b" target="_blank">months</a>,
but the major energy producers in the Middle East have yet to curtail
their production and exports, Eurasia analyst Greg Brew told
me.<br/><br/>“Overall, the crisis in the Red Sea represents a disruption
risk to oil and gas, but not a threat to supply,” Brew said. “Tankers
have alternate routes, and while a diversion of oil and gas shipments on
par with the container ship diversion would add premiums to oil and gas
prices and might bring slight inventory draws in consumer markets,
they’re unlikely to seriously upset energy flows.”
</p>
<p>
It’s not just fossil fuels that are affected by turmoil in the Red Sea.
Tesla’s Berlin plant will pause production for two weeks because of
delays in getting parts. Citing both the plant delays and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/hertz-tesla-ev-selloff" target="_blank">Hertz’s
decision</a> to sell off tens of thousands of Teslas from its rental
fleet, Morgan Stanley analysts declared in a note to clients “EV
Momentum Hits the Skids.”
</p>
<p>
The alternative route from the Middle East to Europe runs around the
Cape of Good Hope, an added distance of around 6,000 miles and
<a href="https://www.drewry.co.uk/container-insight-weekly/weekly-feature-articles/january-freight-loop---red-sea-crisis-impact-assessment-for-global-shippers" target="_blank">two
extra weeks</a> of shipping time. If more ships are forced to detour
around Africa, that doesn’t just mean higher costs and longer waits, it
also means more emissions. Shipping accounts for
<a href="https://unctad.org/news/transport-newsletter-article-no-99-fourth-quarter-2022" target="_blank">about
3%</a> of global greenhouse gas emissions, a figure that could rise if
global supply chains become less efficient.<del></del>
</p>
<p>
The Suez Canal is not the only global shipping chokepoint under
pressure. The Panama Canal — through which
<a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/key-decision-point-coming-panama-canal" target="_blank">about
6%</a> of global trade flows — has had to reduce the number of ships it
allows through due to an
<a href="https://heatmap.news/the-panama-canal-is-drying-up">ongoing
drought</a> that has lowered levels in the artificial waterway that
feeds the canal system. Last year was the “second driest year in
recorded history of the Panama Canal Watershed,” according to the Panama
Canal Authority, with the driest October on record.
</p>
<p>
The Authority announced recently that it would up the number of ships
allowed through every day from 22 to 24, although typically in January,
36 ships
<a href="https://pancanal.com/en/panama-canal-to-increase-daily-transits-to-24-starting-in-january/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">would
be able go to go through</a>.

House Speaker Insists He’s Sticking to Budget Deal but Announces No Plan
to Stop Shutdown</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — House Speaker Mike Johnson insisted Friday he is
sticking with the bipartisan spending deal he struck with the other
congressional leaders, but he offered no clear path for overcoming
hard-right opposition within his own party to prevent a partial
government shutdown next week.</p>
<p>Johnson emerged from days of testy meetings behind closed doors at
the Capitol to read a terse statement. Just months on the job, the new
speaker is trying to set the record straight that he will not renege on
the budget deal he made earlier this week. But in his first big test as
the new leader, he has yet to show how he will quell the revolt from his
right flank that ousted his predecessor.</p>
<p>“Our top-line agreement remains,” Johnson, a Republican from
Louisiana, said, referring to the budget accord reached January 7.</p>
<p>“We are getting our next steps together, and we are working toward a
robust appropriations process,” he said. “So, stay tuned for all
that.”</p>
<p>It’s the same intractable political dilemma that led a core group of
right-flank Republicans to boot Representative Kevin McCarthy from the
speaker’s office last year as they revolted against the deal he struck
with the other congressional leaders and President Joe Biden signed into
law.</p>
<p>Lawmakers during the first work week of the new year are furious
that, after spending much of 2023 watching hard-right Republicans fight
the leaders, they are quickly careening toward another crisis with just
a week to go before the January 19 deadline to fund parts of the
government or risk a shutdown yet again.</p>
<p>As some Republicans from the Freedom Caucus again raise the threat of
a motion to oust the speaker over the deal, other Republicans are
furious they are starting 2024 with the same problems of governing.</p>
<p>In the morning before Johnson made his statement, he met with about
two dozen House Republicans, more of them centrist-leaning voices,
urging him not to go back on his word and stick with the deal.</p>
<p>The centrists assured Johnson they have his back.</p>
<p>“I just can’t imagine the House wants to relive the madness,” said
Representative French Hill of Arkansas, who had helped McCarthy
negotiate the initial agreement with Biden and the other leaders.</p>
<p>“This concept of trying to break a deal that was negotiated, it’s a
foreign concept,” said Republican Representative Mario Diaz-Balart of
Florida. “What you would be asking is for the speaker to basically break
his word and lie. That’s just something you can’t ask him to do.”</p>
<p>Since Congress resumed from the holiday break, Johnson has been holed
up in his office at the Capitol receiving a steady stream of Republican
lawmakers trying to force his hand.</p>
<p>Just two days into the workweek, the House hit a crisis Wednesday
when hard-right Republicans forced the chamber to a standstill. They
voted against a routine procedural rules package as a way to demand the
speaker’s attention.</p>
<p>They are pressing Johnson to refuse the deal, with its $1.66 trillion
in spending for the year, and to instead consider a temporary measure
that would keep the government open but force 1% across-the-board cuts
that are required to kick in if the broader package falls apart.</p>
<p>The hard-right flank is also insisting that new immigration policies
be included, which they say would stop the record flow of migrants at
the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>Republican Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona said in floor remarks
that Republicans should “shut the government down until you shut the
border down.”</p>
<p>But by Friday it was more centrist lawmakers making their way to
Johnson’s office, many of them who serve on the appropriations panels
writing the spending bills, urging him to hold firm to the deal he
struck.</p>
<p>Some have suggested that Johnson should consider trying to pass a
temporary measure that would fund the government for several more weeks,
into March.</p>
<p>Biden signed the spending framework into law as part of a deal he
struck last spring with McCarthy. It was agreed to by the other
congressional leaders from both parties and approved by the House and
Senate as part of an effort to raise the nation’s debt limit to avert a
federal default.</p>
<p>In the time since, congressional leaders have been working to devise
the top-line spending numbers. McCarthy could never deliver on the final
numbers before he was ousted after reaching across the aisle to pass a
temporary measure in September and prevent a shutdown at that time.</p>
<p>Johnson and the other leaders, Democrats and Republicans in the House
and Senate, picked up where they left off and reached a top-line deal at
the start of the year that the speaker is now trying to have
approved.</p>

id="buffalo-supermarket-gunman-who-killed-10-will-face-death-penalty-in-federal-hate-crimes-case">Buffalo
Supermarket Gunman Who Killed 10 Will Face Death Penalty in Federal Hate
Crimes Case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>buffalo, new york — Federal prosecutors will seek the death penalty
against a white supremacist who killed 10 Black people at a Buffalo
supermarket, they said in a court filing Friday.</p>
<p>Payton Gendron, 20, is already serving a sentence of life in prison
with no chance of parole after he pleaded guilty to state charges of
murder and hate-motivated domestic terrorism in the 2022 attack.</p>
<p>New York does not have capital punishment, but the Justice Department
had the option of seeking the death penalty in a separate federal hate
crimes case. Gendron had promised to plead guilty in that case if
prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty.</p>
<p>In a notice announcing the decision to seek the death penalty, Trini
Ross, the U.S. attorney for western New York, wrote that Gendron had
selected the supermarket “in order to maximize the number of Black
victims.”</p>
<p>The notice cited a range of factors for the decision, including the
substantial planning leading to the shooting and the decision to target
at least one victim who was “particularly vulnerable due to old age and
infirmity.”</p>
<p>Relatives of the victims had expressed mixed views on whether they
thought federal prosecutors should pursue the death penalty.</p>
<p>“I’m not necessarily disappointed in the decision. … It would have
satisfied me more knowing he would have spent the rest of his life in
prison being surrounded by the population of people he tried to kill,”
Mark Talley, whose 63-year-old mother Geraldine Talley was killed, said
Friday.</p>
<p>“I would prefer he spend the rest of his life in prison suffering
every day,” he added.</p>
<p>This is the first time Attorney General Merrick Garland has
authorized a new pursuit of the death penalty. Under his leadership, the
Justice Department has permitted the continuation of two capital
prosecutions and withdrawn from pursuing death in more than two dozen
cases.</p>
<p>There was no immediate comment from other victims’ families or
prosecutors.</p>
<p>The Justice Department has made federal death penalty cases a rarity
since the election of President Joe Biden, a Democrat who opposes
capital punishment. Garland instituted a moratorium on federal
executions in 2021 pending a review of procedures. Although the
moratorium does not prevent prosecutors from seeking death sentences,
the Justice Department has done so sparingly.</p>
<p>It successfully sought the death penalty for an antisemitic gunman
who murdered 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue, which had been
authorized as a death penalty case before Garland became attorney
general. It also went ahead last year with an effort to get the death
sentence against an Islamic extremist who killed eight people on a New
York City bike path, though a lack of a unanimous jury meant that
prosecution resulted in a life sentence.</p>
<p>The Justice Department has declined to pursue the death penalty in
other mass killings. It passed on seeking the execution of a gunman who
killed 23 people at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas.</p>
<p>On May 14, 2022, Gendron attacked shoppers and workers with a
semi-automatic rifle at a Tops Friendly Market in Buffalo after driving
more than 200 miles (320 kilometers) from his home in rural Conklin, New
York.</p>
<p>He chose the business for its location in a predominantly Black
neighborhood and livestreamed the massacre from a camera attached to his
tactical helmet.</p>
<p>The victims, who ranged in age from 32 to 86, included eight
customers, the store security guard and a church deacon who drove
shoppers to and from the store with their groceries. Three people were
wounded but survived.</p>
<p>The rifle Gendron fired was marked with racial slurs and phrases
including “The Great Replacement,” a reference to a conspiracy theory
that there’s a plot to diminish the influence of white people.</p>

<h2 id="pluralistic-the-cult-of-mac-12-jan-2024">Pluralistic: The Cult
of Mac (12 Jan 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-12, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links The Cult of Mac: You cannot reason a person out of a
position they did not reason themself into in the first place. Hey look
at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2014, 2019, 2023
Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current
writing projects, current reading The Cult of Mac (permalink) Apple’s
most valuable intangible asset isn’t its patents or copyrights – it’s an
army of people who believe that using products from a $2.89 trillion
multinational makes them members of an oppressed religious minority
whose identity is coterminal with the interests of Apple’s shareholders.
Take the App Store. Apple blocks third parties from offering rival app
stores for its iOS platform, which means you can only install apps that
have been blessed by Apple. That blessing is contingent on the software
authors involved giving $0.30 out of every dollar you spend in their
apps to Apple. This has two effects: first, it makes certain products
impossible to offer. The gross margin on an audiobook is 20%. Apple
takes a 30% cut of sales. Try to sell audiobooks in an app, and you’ll
lose money on every sale. That’s why non-Apple audiobook stores like
Libro.fm and Downpour require you to buy your books in a browser, which
hamstrings them and gives Apple an unbeatable advantage (Apple doesn’t
charge itself 30% on every transaction, obviously). But at least you can
buy audiobooks on Apple Books. There are plenty of services whose gross
margins are lower than 30%. Apple’s 30% App Tax renders these unviable,
and if Apple doesn’t deign to offer its own in-house monopoly version,
the service is simply unavailable as an iPhone app. But that’s not the
only bad outcome. Some lucky service providers are able to pay the Apple
Tax by gouging Apple’s customers, raising prices to pay the danegeld.
That’s the second effect. This is obviously bad for industry. Take the
news media: some people think the thing that Big Tech steals from the
news is the news itself. That’s a frankly bizarre argument: including
the news in a search index or providing a forum where people can talk
about the news is not bad for the news. News you’re not allowed to find
or talk about isn’t news, it’s a secret. But Big Tech most assuredly
steals from the news: it steals money. The ad-tech duopoly takes 51% out
of every ad dollar. Social media holds news subscribers to ransom and
requires “boosting” payment to reach the people who’ve asked to see
their articles. And the mobile duopoly takes 30% out of every in-app
subscription dollar:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/06/save-news-we-must-open-app-stores
The mobile duopoly likes to talk about the “mobile ecosystem,” but it’s
no ecosystem – it’s a pair of walled gardens:
https://crookedtimber.org/2022/12/08/your-platform-is-not-an-ecosystem/
It’s a planned economy run by a pair of corporate executives who
deliberate in secret and are accountable only to their shareholders.
Thankfully, some regulators are alive to the hazards of this
technofeudal arrangement and are taking firm measures:
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-13/apple-set-to-be-hit-by-eu-antitrust-order-in-app-store-fight-with-spotify
These regulators couch their enforcement action in terms of defending an
open market, but the benefits to app makers is only incidental. The real
beneficiaries of an open app world is Apple customers. After all, it’s
Apple customers who bear the 30% app tax when it’s priced into the apps
they buy and the things they buy in those apps. It’s Apple customers who
lose access to apps that can’t be viably offered because the app tax
makes them money-losing propositions. It’s Apple customers who lose out
on the ability to get apps that Apple decides are unsuitable for
inclusion in its App Store. That’s where the Cult Of Mac steps in to
cape for the $3 trillion behemoth. The minority of Apple customers for
whom their brand loyalty is a form of religious devotion insist that “no
Apple customer wants these things.” This is such obvious nonsense that
it can only be described as an article of faith, not a reasoned
position. If rival app stores – ones that had different editorial
standards and different payment policies – existed, the only people who
could possibly use them are Apple customers. Android users won’t be
using an alternative iOS store. Symbian users aren’t going to be
installing apps from an iOS store offered by someone other than Apple.
If it’s true that “Apple customers don’t want non-Apple app stores,”
then Apple wouldn’t need to use technological countermeasures and legal
threats to prevent them from coming into existence. These non-Apple app
stores would fail on their own terms. This is a point I first raised in
The Guardian in 2015, with a satirical piece called “If Dishwashers Were
iPhones” – a letter from a charismatic smart dishwasher company called
Absterge, explaining why it’s unreasonable for customers to expect to
their dishes from third-party dish vendors:
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/13/if-dishwashers-were-iphones
The comments on that article are wild. It’s just a litany of people
saying, “If you want to choose where you buy your apps, you shouldn’t
buy an iPhone.” That this is exactly the same argument the fictional
Absterge CEO makes about his dishwasher (“People who don’t want to go
the Absterge way don’t have to”) is lost on them. As far as they’re
concerned, any Apple customer who wants have the final say over how
their $1,000 pocket computer works isn’t a true Apple customer. This is
a very weird idea. But weirder still is how it captured lawmakers, like
the former Canadian Heritage Minister James Moore. In 2010, Moore and
his colleague, the disgraced sex pest Tony Clement, tabled a bill that
would make it illegal for Canadians to modify their iPhones (and other
gadgets) to work in ways that benefited them at the expense of corporate
shareholders. They ran a consultation on this measure, and the responses
overwhelmingly rejected it (6138 submissions opposed to the measure, 54
in support!). They pressed ahead anyway:
https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2010/04/copycon-final-numbers/ When the
public demanded an explanation for this, Moore said that opponents of
the measure were “radical extremists”:
https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/copyright-debate-turns-ugly-1.898216
This was a bridge too far. I am a bestselling Canadian author whose
copyright-related income comes from royalties, not industry campaign
contributions. The idea that the Heritage Minister would brand me a
“radical extremist” got my goat, so I picked a fight with him on
Twitter, where he unwisely took the bait:
https://web.archive.org/web/20130407101911if_/http://eaves.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/Conversations%20between%20@doctorow%20and%20@mpjamesmoore.jpg
Moore’s responses were straight out of the comments from “If iPhones
Were Dishwashers.” Quoth the Minister: “Don’t use Mac. There are other
options out there.” Remember: the only people who could use an
alternative iOS store are Apple customers. Moore – a Minister from the
Conservative Party – went on record saying that if you want to use your
private, personal property in ways that the corporation that
manufactured it objects to you, the government should step in to defend
the corporation from you. This is not the property-worshiping,
market-based ideology the Conservative Party claims to support. The only
way to square that circle is if somehow, the people who want to install
apps on their phones without the manufacturer’s approval are not really
customers. They’re pretenders. Apostates. They’re holding it wrong:
https://www.wired.com/2010/06/iphone-4-holding-it-wrong/ These religious
apologetics for Apple’s business practices are a devastatingly effective
defense against the public outcry that would accrue to any other
business that abused its customers in similar fashion. Every time Apple
finds a new way to rip off its customers, the cult is there to insist
that those aren’t true Apple customers at all! Think of Apple’s
years-long war on repair. When Apple gets a veto over where you fix the
small, slippery, glass object you carry everywhere and hence break a
lot, they can get up to all kinds of mischief. They can gouge you on
parts and service charges, sure. But they can also simply rule out
fixing your device at all, declaring it beyond repair. This prompts you
to buy another gadget from them, and they get to offer you a trade-in.
That means that your old gadget gets “recycled” by Apple, who – uniquely
among electronics manufacturers – drops all its “recycled” gadgets in
giant shredders, ensuring that parts from old phones don’t find their
way into the secondary market for use by independent repair:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/05/22/apples-cement-overshoes/ Apple isn’t
coy about all this! Tim Apple’s 2019 shareholders letter spelled it out
explicitly: Apple’s revenues are falling because its customers are
fixing their phones rather than replacing them:
https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/
Apple led the coalition that killed dozens of state right to repair
bills for years. When repair advocates pointed out that this was
creating mountains of immortal ewaste that included tons of conflict
minerals, Apple’s religious adherents stepped into insist that Apple
customers preferred to get their iPhone fixed by Apple and its approved
depots. Again, this is obvious nonsense. If it were the case that No
True Apple Customer would patronize a third-party repair depot, then
Apple could simply step out of the way of right to repair campaigns and
those independent phone fixit places would sink without a trace. People
who own Android devices don’t get their phones fixed with unauthorized
iPhone parts. The chorus of credulous, faithful shouters gives Apple
enormous cover to get up to the worst behavior. Apple keeps making
announcements about its commitment to repair that get trumpeted to the
heavens, even though these announcements barely bother to cover up how
Apple will continue to block repair in practice:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/22/vin-locking/#thought-differently This
reality-distortion field is remarkably durable. It remains intact even
when rivals take the exact opposite position and demonstrate exactly
what a real, non-pretextual pro-repair policy looks like:
https://www.404media.co/google-formally-endorses-right-to-repair-will-lobby-to-pass-strong-repair-laws/
A key tenet of the Cult Of Mac is that Apple’s sins are actually
virtues, because all its monopolistic conduct is in service to its
users’ privacy and security. After all, this is the company that faced
down the FBI when the US government tried to force it to weaken its
encryption:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/04/fbi-could-have-gotten-san-bernardino-shooters-iphone-leadership-didnt-say
And it’s true, they did! They also added anti-tracking features that
shut down Facebook’s ability to spy on iOS users, a move that Facebook
claims cost it $10b in the first year alone (you love to see it):
https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/96-of-us-users-opt-out-of-app-tracking-in-ios-14-5-analytics-find/
But Apple’s commitment to your privacy and security is always
contingent, and when its own profits are on the line, the company will
swiftly stuff you and your safety out the airlock. Apple refused to
weaken its security for the FBI, but when China threatened its access to
cheap manufacturing and hundreds of millions of customers, Apple
eviscerated its products:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/11/foreseeable-consequences/#airdropped
Apple blocked Facebook from spying on you, but when it wanted to build
its own surveillance advertising empire, it switched iOS spying back on,
gathering exactly the same data as Facebook had, but for its own sole
use, and then lied about it:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/14/luxury-surveillance/#liar-liar And
then there’s iMessage, Apple’s default messaging service – “default” in
the sense that there’s no way to use other messaging apps without taking
additional steps. IMessage has end-to-end encryption – but only when
you’re communicating with other Apple customers. The instant an Android
user is added to a chat or group chat, the entire conversation flips to
SMS, an insecure, trivially hacked privacy nightmare that debuted 38
years ago – the year Wayne’s World had its first cinematic run. About
41% of American mobile phone users have an Android phone, which means
that any time an Apple customer tries to have a conversation with a
colleague, a merchant, a loved one, a friend or a family member, there’s
a 4 in 10 chance it’s going out “in the clear,” with zero privacy
protections. This is not good for Apple customers. It exposes them to
continuous, serious privacy risks. Our mobile devices are keepers of our
most intimate secrets, and when mobile security fails, the consequences
are grave, as Apple discovered in the hardest way possible, ten years
ago: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_celebrity_nude_photo_leak
Apple’s answer to this is grimly hilarious. The company’s position is
that if you want to have real security in your communications, you
should buy your friends iPhones. Presumably, if those friends – or
merchants, or colleagues – don’t want to change operating systems and
throw away their device and all their apps, you should just stop talking
to them:
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tim-cook-says-buy-mom-210347694.html One
of the clinical signs that someone is in a cult is that they are
encouraged to isolate themselves from people who aren’t also in that
cult:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_to_facilitate_abuse#In_cults But
there are billions of Apple customers and only a small (but vocal and
obnoxious!) minority of those customers are actual cult members, which
means that there are billions of people who’d prefer to have private,
secure communications with everyone in their lives, not just their
fellow Apple customers. That’s where Beeper Mini comes in: it’s a
third-party Android version of iMessage that builds on the work of a
teenager who reverse-engineered iMessage and found a way to let Android
users receive secure messages sent by Apple customers:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/07/blue-bubbles-for-all/#never-underestimate-the-determination-of-a-kid-who-is-time-rich-and-cash-poor
This was an immense service to Apple customers, correcting a gaping
security vulnerability in Apple’s flagship product, that had been
deliberately introduced, putting the company’s profits ahead of its
customers’ safety and privacy. Apple immediately rolled out a series of
countermeasures to block Beeper Mini. When The Verge’s David Pierce
asked them why, Apple said they did it to protect their customers’
security (!!):
https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23995150/beeper-imessage-android-apple-statement
The company claimed that there was some nonspecific way in which Beeper
Mini weakened the security of Apple customers, though they offered no
evidence in support of that claim. Remember, the gold standard for
security claims is proof-of-concept code, not hand-waving:
https://nostarch.com/gtfo For its part, Beeper engaged in a brief but
intense cat-and-mouse game with Apple, taking countermeasures and
countercountermeasures to preserve Apple customers’ access to secure
communications with Android users:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/12/without-interoperability-apple-customers-will-never-be-secure
Apple used its $3 trillion megaphone to condemn Beeper Mini all the
while, even after Beeper published the source code for Beeper Mini so
that anyone could verify for themselves that nothing nefarious was going
on: https://blog.beeper.com/p/beeper-moving-forward Meanwhile, Apple’s
cultists rallied behind the company. Not only would No True Apple
Customer ever want to have secure communications with an Android user,
but it was unfair for Beeper to profit by accessing Apple’s messaging
infrastructure, which Apple has to pay to maintain. This is some serious
upside-down cult logic. Beeper isn’t accessing Apple’s infrastructure:
Apple’s customers are accessing Apple’s infrastructure. If there were no
Apple customers trying to talk to Android users, there would be no load

<h2 id="i-own-an-ev-but-wont-rent-one-on-vacation.-heres-why.">I Own an
EV But Won’t Rent One on Vacation. Here’s Why.</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-12, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTA3MTIzOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NTc2MDM5N30.Q_wNTq71uXDY9RmUAd60YT3JCpCsRPvFg2XUm1XUSNo/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
A year ago, before a vacation to see the eruption of the Hawaiian
volcano Kīlauea, I found myself scrolling through my rental car options.
A few users on the car-sharing service Turo offered up their Tesla Model
3s, and I was tempted by the idea of driving electric on holiday just as
I would at home. One problem: There are no superchargers on the Big
Island. I opted instead for a dependable, decade-old Hyundai Sonata —
one that cost half as much per day.
</p>
<p>
An electric rental car is an easier sell in a big city with plenty of
fast chargers. Even so, it appears that Americans at large are making
the same choice that I did. Rental car giant Hertz made a big
<a href="https://newsroom.hertz.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tom-brady-reveals-all-electrifying-new-hertz-ads-featuring" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">splash</a>
by adding Teslas to its fleet in 2021 and using NFL legend Tom Brady to
advertise them. Now, instead of scaling up to 25% EV by this year as it
had
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/14/hertz-is-going-electric-with-big-implications-for-ev-and-auto-market.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">once
planned</a>, Hertz says it will
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-11/hertz-to-sell-20-000-evs-in-shift-back-to-gas-powered-cars?sref=5dj0X2VO" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sell
off</a> a third of its EVs because of weak demand and higher costs. The
company plans to use the money to shift back toward more
gasoline-powered cars.
</p>
<p>
I can’t say I’m surprised. EVs are, at least for this moment, an awkward
fit for America’s rental car economy.
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, a rental is a great way for someone with no time behind
the wheel of an EV to experience the reality of ownership. As a member
of the car press, I got to test a Model 3 for several days before I
bought my own. Believe me: A brief test drive from the dealership is
nothing compared to what you’ll learn from puttering around in one of
Hertz’s EVs for a few days, getting accustomed to its user interface and
to the task of recharging. If you’re thinking about buying an electric
car and you have a vacation in the near future, I’d encourage you to
take the opportunity. An EV rental car is also an attractive option for
lowering a vacation’s environmental footprint, since you’re probably
already flying in a carbon-spewing airplane.
</p>
<p>
A rental car is also a good excuse to drive something fun or goofy. On a
business trip a decade ago, I fulfilled a boyhood daydream by taking the
bright red Jeep Wrangler and bombing around the San Francisco Bay Area
with the top down (thanks, corporate card). A weekend car rental offers
the chance to hop in a Tesla, which remains an usual or exotic
experience in most places outside of California. However, Hertz’s
struggles suggest that allure isn’t enough to overcome the higher cost
of renting an EV. Especially when the bottom-dollar beater gets you
where you’re going, if not in style.
</p>
<p>
The biggest issue, of course, is the fear of the unknown. Because so few
Americans own a pure EV, renting one means learning a new driving
paradigm — a chore, if not an outright headache. The last thing most
people want to do while traveling to a conference in Boston or
vacationing to the beaches of Los Angeles is to figure out how to put a
Tesla into reverse or worry whether there’s a supercharger close to the
hotel.
</p>
<p>
In truth,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/arguments-against-evs-bad" target="_self">it’s
not so bad</a>. Once you’re inside an electric vehicle, the experience
is built to be as idiot-proof as possible. Most modern EVs feature a big
touchscreen with a map that will route you to available charging
locations. The car will make sure to warn you, repeatedly, if it thinks
you’re letting the battery get too low or straying too far from
available chargers.
</p>
<p>
As much as the vehicle’s UI strives to inspire confidence, though, it’s
easy to see why drivers who don’t already own EVs feel wary. The Biden
administration’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/manchin-ev-tax-credit-rules" target="_self">big
push</a> may indeed expand America’s charging infrastructure. For now,
though, there are still plenty of horror stories of people beset by
busted plugs, slow chargers, long lines, or lousy interfaces. Vacation
is supposed to be about decompressing, not range anxiety. Until chargers
become much more reliable and get closer to ubiquitous, travelers will
choose the known quantity: pump gas and put away the climate part of
their brain.
</p>
<p>
That’s not to say EVs are doomed in the rental car market, or that
tourists will forever spew carbon emissions from the backs of their
battered Nissan Altimas and Honda CR-Vs. As <em>Bloomberg</em> reports,
Hertz is paying close attention to GM’s attempts to revive the Chevrolet
Bolt and introduce an electrified Equinox crossover as entry-level EVs
in the low $30,000s. At that level, an agency could rent out EVs at
prices more competitive with their traditional gas-burners. As EVs grow
cheaper to rent and drivers grow more confident about charging, some of
them will think hard about renting electric — especially in times of
spiking gas prices. Perhaps a day will come when companies require their
traveling employees to rent EVs instead of combustion cars as a way to
keep costs down or to contribute to the firm’s green claims.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, the question of rental EVs hovers in the same moment of
uncertainty that clouds everything EV.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/are-ev-sales-really-slowing-data" target="_self">Sales
of electrics are not slowing</a>, despite reports to the contrary.
However the legacy automakers <em>are</em> seriously struggling with
their electric transitions. Heatmap’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/electric-cars-partisanship-problem" target="_self">reporting</a>
has shown a major partisanship-based gap in EV buying interest, and that
drivers in much of the country aren’t nearly as interested in buying
electric cars as Ford and GM have suddenly become in selling them. The
bad vibes are enough to make one wonder whether those living outside of
large, EV-friendly large cities will ever embrace owning an EV, let
alone become comfortable enough to rent one the next time they fly the
family to Disney World.

Meets Top China Foreign Minister Candidate Before Taiwan Elections</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken held talks with
veteran Chinese diplomat Liu Jianchao on Friday morning, a day before
Taiwan’s presidential and legislative elections — a test for efforts to
stabilize tensions between the United States and China. </p>
<p>Washington has cautioned Beijing against using the elections as a
pretext for instability in the Taiwan Strait. </p>
<p>In keeping with a long-standing precedent, the United States is
sending a bipartisan delegation to Taiwan after the election.   </p>
<p>The U.S. delegation includes members of the Congressional Taiwan
Caucus; Laura Rosenberger, who chairs the American Institute in Taiwan;
and former officials who served under both Democratic and Republican
administrations.   </p>
<p>Direct message </p>
<p>Liu, who heads the Chinese Communist Party’s International Liaison
Department, is the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit the United
States since U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping
met on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit
south of San Francisco on November 15. </p>
<p>A source familiar with the meeting said that in diplomacy, it is
crucial to convey messages directly to China on “the importance of peace
and stability in the region ahead of the Taiwan elections, and in light
of recent PRC provocations in the South China Sea.” </p>
<p>In a statement, the State Department said Blinken “reiterated the
importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait
and in the South China Sea.”</p>
<p>“The two sides had a constructive discussion on a range of bilateral,
regional and global issues, including areas of potential cooperation and
areas of difference,” said State Department spokesperson Matthew
Miller.</p>
<p>“The secretary emphasized the importance of resolving the cases of
American citizens who are wrongfully detained or subject to exit bans in
China and raised U.S. concerns about PRC human rights abuses,” Miller
said in a statement late Friday.</p>
<p>The sending of the U.S. delegation to Taipei after the elections is
perceived as an effort to preempt a strong reaction from Beijing. </p>
<p>A Chinese spokesperson repeated Beijing’s assertion on Friday that
Taiwan’s elections are China’s internal affairs, and that China opposes
any form of official contact between the U.S. and Taiwan. </p>
<p>China claims sovereignty over the self-ruled democracy.  The U.S.
acknowledges but has never endorsed Beijing’s position. </p>
<p>The winner of Taiwan’s presidential election will be inaugurated on
May 20. The transition period in the coming months is seen as sensitive
in cross-strait relations. </p>
<p>Liu is seen as a leading contender to be China’s next foreign
minister, according to some media reports and analysts.</p>
<p>It is unusual for the minister of the International Liaison
Department, a unit under the Communist Party’s Central Committee, to
visit the United States, according to Bonnie Glaser, managing director
of the Indo-Pacific Program at the German Marshall Fund. </p>
<p>“The most likely explanation for this visit, and the reason that he
is being received by Blinken, is that Liu is likely to be China’s next
foreign minister. The visit provides an opportunity for the U.S. to take
his measure in advance of his formal appointment, likely at the upcoming
National People’s Congress” in early March, Glaser told VOA. </p>
<p>In a blog post by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and
International Studies, or CSIS, Liu was described as China’s “shadow
foreign minister.”  </p>
<p>“China still has the same leader, Xi Jinping, whose overall views and
vision have not changed. Shifts in other personnel or a more engaging
tone may not make a huge difference in the content of China’s foreign
policy,” said the CSIS blog.</p>
<p>Senior U.S. officials attending Friday’s meeting include the State
Department’s top diplomat on East Asian and Pacific affairs, Daniel
Kritenbrink, and its China coordinator, Mark Lambert. </p>
<p>World Economic Forum  </p>
<p>Communication between the world’s two largest economies will continue
after Taiwan’s elections, as senior U.S. and Chinese officials are to
attend next week’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Blinken
and Chinese Premier Li Qiang will attend the annual economic meetings at
the Swiss mountain resort. </p>
<p>Blinken’s talks with Chinese officials are described as efforts to
maintain open lines of communication, responsibly manage differences
between the two nations and address various issues. These include global
and regional security concerns, such as Russia’s war against Ukraine, as
well as peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. </p>
<p>According to some estimates, about half of all global trade flows
through the Taiwan Strait, and its stability is critical to the global
economy. </p>

is facing a budget mess. It’s not alone.</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-12, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
California, home of the fifth largest economy in the world, has a budget
deficit of between $38 billion and $68 billion, depending on the
estimate. But even with the economy doing pretty well across the
country, other states have budget woes as well, many of which were
papered over by federal pandemic aid. Also on the program: a look at
falling wholesale prices and increased oversight of Boeing.

<h2 id="my-night-at-the-dean-campaign">My night at the Dean
campaign</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-12, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I’d love to tell you a story about the time I had the authority to post
to the Dean campaign home page, and they deleted a post I wrote on the
night of the famous
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6i-gYRAwM0">Dean Scream</a>
that might have saved the campaign. They were trying to make the story
go away. As we know the story didn’t go away.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2008/03/22/iWasAtDeanHqTheNightTheyDi.html">2008</a>:
“The campaign had video that showed clearly that the press was actively
trying to kill his candidacy. They had a website, and they had enough
money to pay for the bandwidth to run it. They knew what the press was
trying to do. They could have fought it. But they didn’t.”
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/12/15/deanForAmericaBumperSticker.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">That
night I became friends with Nicco Mele, he was the webmaster at Dean who
<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/10/28/itsAWrap.html#remindsMeOfAStory">gave</a>
me the power. I was in their Burlington headquarters at the moment the
whole thing imploded, the night of the Iowa caucus. I’ve also become
friends with Joe Trippi, the campaign manager for Dean in 2008. They
probably accelerated the adoption of online media in American politics
by a decade or more. However, a lot of the ideas from that time are
gone, but hopefully not forever.
</p>
<p>
The biggest idea was that it gave people a sense of belonging, that they
weren’t powerless to influence or even control the US government. We all
felt that the war in Iraq was wrong, Dean gave Americans a way to say
that clearly, with their own actions. I think if we want to achieve our
destiny in the 2024 election, we need to get some of that into the
campaign, or democracy won’t prevail.
</p>
<p>
There’s a story about how Trump makes people feel like they belong in
<a href="https://wapo.st/3U224ud">the Washington Post</a> written by
Philip Bump that Joe and Nicco should read if they haven’t. This is
something Trump gets that the Democrats have forgotten they know. People
don’t vote on policy, they vote to belong to something they believe
might fix things, whatever that means to them.

SwiftUI-ficating Godot on iPad is the ultimate Yak Shaving exercise.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday I figured “quick win, remove the menu” and that turned into
“wire up the Godot new scene” and that turned into “oh but that needs to

callbacks everywhere.
</p>
<p>

<strong></strong>Tesla will suspend operations at its Berlin gigafactory

<li>Hertz suggests its EV rentals are in more accidents than gas
guzzlers
</h3>
<p>
Car-rental company Hertz is making a “dramatic about-face” on electric
vehicles,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e58847caef&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a><em>
Bloomberg Green</em>. The firm will sell off 20,000 EVs – about a third
of its EV fleet – and use the money to buy gas-powered cars. One analyst
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=49974df18e&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggested</a>
the sell-off could boost Hertz’s cashflow by up to $300 million over the
next year or so. The company has given several reasons for the move:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Lack of demand from customers
</li>
<li>
Unexpected loss in resale value due to Tesla’s steep price cuts (most of
the vehicles in Hertz’s EV fleet are Teslas)
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=2226261793&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Increased
collisions</a> and higher repair costs
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Why more accidents? Perhaps customers who rent EVs don’t understand how
the driving experience differs from that of a gasoline vehicle,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=5dda1206b4&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posited</a>
Stephen Scherr, Hertz’s chief executive. EVs are much heavier, after
all, and they accelerate more quickly. While

schools</a> are starting to incorporate EVs into their driver’s ed
courses, a small learning curve still exists for most Americans, and a
road trip probably isn’t the best time to confront it.
</p>
<p>
Hertz says it isn’t abandoning EVs entirely, but wants to let the market
develop. The upshot for anyone looking to buy a cheap EV is that “now
would be a really good time to pop over to Hertz’s sales page and start
browsing,”
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=a1860725c4&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>

little as $20,000.

budget deficit and is eyeing climate programs. The initiatives on the
chopping block include clean transportation, forest maintenance,
watershed resilience, and coastal protection. The state’s Extreme Heat

wildfire reduction programs could see $100.7 million in cuts.
Environmentalists lamented the news; Newsom’s office insisted the
state’s climate goals were still a priority, noting that more than $10
billion in funding from the Inflation Reduction Act will help soften the
blow.

from Australian nonprofit Renew suggests countries take a lesson from
the Spanish city of Seville, which began naming heatwaves in 2022 to
create a “heat culture” in which the public is more aware of and
prepared for looming dangerous temperatures. “Naming heatwaves is about
letting people know that this is a serious issue,”

<p>date: 2024-01-12, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
This is the 20th edition of <em>People and Blogs</em>, the series where
I ask interesting people to talk about themselves and their blogs. Today
we have Rachel Smith and her blog,
<a href="https://rachsmith.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">rachsmith.com</a>
</p>
<p>
Rachel is an Australian developer, working at CodePen and she’s been
suggested by three of the previous guests so I had to get her on
P&amp;B.
</p>
<p>

<hr />
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce
yourself?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I’m Rach, a 37 year old from Australia. I’m a mum to two little ones and
I work as a developer at CodePen.
</p>
<p>
I always loved computers as a kid and the internet as a teen, but I
struggled to find a place for me until I discovered front-end
development as a profession in 2011.
</p>
<p>
I spent the first half of my career working in digital advertising,
allowing me to live abroad working for agencies in the UK and USA, and
the second half working on a single product (CodePen). Working for
CodePen has allowed me to expand my skills far beyond the front end, and
now I do a bit of everything.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What's the story behind your blog?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
This is actually somewhere around the seventh attempt at keeping a blog.
I had two LiveJournals and a Blogspot as a teen. Since I started my
career as a developer I’ve had maybe three different self-hosted blogs,
that I tore down and started again, as well as a now-defunct CodePen
blog that had code-tutorial style posts. This iteration is the one that
has stuck the longest.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to
blogging?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Something that has been really helpful with my blog was actually to stop
thinking about it in terms of a “blog”, and more of a “digital garden”.
I can default to perfectionistic thinking if I’m not careful, and I used
to treat blog posts like a finished piece that needed to be polished
until it was just right before publishing. By changing my “blog posts”
to “notes”, it changes the way I think about writing them and gets me to
publish far more often.
</p>
<p>
I do all of my writing in an <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>
vault. It keeps my personal notes as well as the published ones. When I
want to publish a note I run a script that copies the note content to
the directory holding my website’s content.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe
the physical space influences your creativity?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Before having kids, I could be quite precious about needing a specific
environment to get any work done. Now, it is certainly nice to be able
to write in a peaceful setting, but I’m also able to do it from anywhere
- on the phone in my car, at the kitchen bench with Paw Patrol playing
in the background.
</p>
<p>
One thing I will say is by far the biggest environmental factor that
influences my creativity is how much I am on my phone. If I’m on my
phone consuming all the time, there is no space for having thoughts
about what to write. If I put the phone away, the ideas arrive.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your
tech stack?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I write all my posts in Markdown and use
<a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> to publish them on the web. All
the content is kept in a GitHub repository with the site’s code. The
site is hosted for free with Netlify.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would
you do anything differently?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
If I were to do it all again, I think I would make an effort to save
more of the old posts I had on previous versions of this blog. I’m like
the opposite of a hoarder - I think nothing of tossing things away as I
love the idea of a fresh start. But sometimes I think it would be nice
to go back and read what I wrote 10 years ago.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how
much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it
generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising
personal blogs?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
All I have to pay for in the running of my blog is the analytics
(Plausible) and the domain registration.
</p>
<p>
I’ve had a couple of ad networks offer to place ads on my blog but I’ve
always turned them down. My audience is quite small, but very engaged
and loyal. Annoying my regular readers wouldn’t be worth the small
amount income I’d make from an attempt at monetisation.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth
checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing
next?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I love reading blogs via RSS and am subscribed to about 30 personal blog
feeds, including many of the people you’ve featured in this series
already, so it is hard to choose favourites. I intend to add a blogroll
to my site soon.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of blogrolls, I would suggest you interview
<a href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/">Stefan Judis</a>. His website is
goals.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with
us?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
If you desire to write on your own blog but something is holding you
back I would say: don’t make assumptions about what people will or won’t
find interesting or useful. Every time I think I’m sharing something
“too niche” I am surprised at the interest from readers.
</p>

<em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Tesla is suspending manufacturing
at its only European electric car factory as attacks in the Red Sea
disrupt supplies. The company said longer delivery times created a gap
in its supply chains as shipping companies avoid the route. And as
Taiwan prepares to go the polls, its tense relationship with Beijing
dominates campaigns — yet for many residents, the economy is among the
biggest issues.

Smart Device Manufacturer Liability and Redress for Third-Party
Cyberattack Victims
</p>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> Smart devices are used to facilitate cyberattacks
against both their users and third parties. While users are generally
able to seek redress following a cyberattack via data protection
legislation, there is no equivalent pathway available to third-party
victims who suffer harm at the hands of a cyberattacker. Given how these
cyberattacks are usually conducted by exploiting a publicly known and
yet un-remediated bug in the smart device’s code, this lacuna is
unreasonable. This paper scrutinises recent judgments from both the
Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and the Supreme Court of the
Republic of Ireland to ascertain whether these rulings pave the way for
third-party victims to pursue negligence claims against the
manufacturers of smart devices. From this analysis, a narrow pathway,
which outlines how given a limited set of circumstances, a duty of care
can be established between the third-party victim and the manufacturer
of the smart device is proposed…

Really Terrifyingly Good Satire’: A New Mexico Passive Home Builder on
Showtime’s ‘The Curse’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-12, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTA0OTI5OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NTI3ODc2OX0.hrPKSbdsTsfCPdX5odqYqeuIGZV9aY0D4ijrhwpI4dM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Edie Dillman lives in the
<a href="https://trendmagazineglobal.com/when-passive-is-powerful/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
first certified passive house in New Mexico</a>. She and her architect
husband, Jonah Stanford, are founders of a company called B.Public
Prefab that builds and supplies prefabricated panels for highly energy
efficient homes.
</p>
<p>
So when <em>The Curse</em> began to air on Showtime this past fall,
following an aspiring HGTV host couple Asher and Whitney Siegel, played
by Canadian awkwardness spelunker and conceptual comic Nathan Fielder
alongside America’s sweetheart Emma Stone, who are trying to get their
show, “Flipanthropy” — during which they build and sell passive homes in
Española, a town half an hour north of Santa Fe — picked up by the
network, Dillman and her husband found out about it.
</p>
<p>
“I was aware the second it launched,” Dillman told me. “There’s some
very obvious correlations of a husband and wife team doing passive homes
in northern New Mexico, for sure. So people started texting saying, ‘are
you watching this? This is horribly painful.’ They were right.”
</p>
<p>
The show plumbs new depths of discomfort for Fielder, who before this
was best known for his conceptual reality shows <em>Nathan For You</em>
and <em>The Rehearsal</em>. <em>The Curse</em> opens with a producer
dabbing the eyes of an elderly woman dying of cancer with water and even
blowing menthol on them to get her to cry when the Siegels offer her son
a job at the upscale coffee shop they’ve brought into town. And it only
gets more uncomfortable from there: Asher takes a $100 bill away from a
young girl after giving it to her on camera and spills a Powerade on a
former coworker in order to steal from his computer; the poor little
girl’s father, meanwhile, goes through what might be the most
uncomfortable chiropractor appointment of all time (some viewers thought
he had died), courtesy of Whitney.
</p>
<p>
Dillman seemed good-natured about the whole thing, even acknowledging
that “any press is good press” and that the show was probably the most
media attention the passive house community has ever gotten.
</p>
<p>
She was also refreshingly forthright about her own position — literally.
“I think it’s fair to tell you, as a journalist writing about this, I’m
sitting in my own home that is a certified passive house and has the
plaque that is almost identical to the plaque they have in the show, so
it’s a little too close to home,” she said. “Be kind in your
reporting.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
<em>The Curse</em> is not a broadside against the passive house
movement, which began in Germany in the 1980s and is based on using
advanced building techniques — namely lots of insulation and thick
windows that eliminate
“<a href="https://blog.passivehouse-international.org/what-is-a-thermal-bridge/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thermal
bridging</a>,” where big differences in temperature create air flows
that lead to inefficient air loss — to minimize the amount of energy
needed to heat and cool a home. The target of the show is more the
narcissism of do-gooders, how publicly virtuous behavior can mask and
enable private avarice (the couple at the center of the show have an
ultimate plan to goose the value of property they own in the town;
Stone’s character is also the daughter of notorious Santa Fe slum lords)
and how reality TV warps everything it touches.
</p>
<p>
But the vehicle <em>The Curse</em> chooses for its narcissistic,
selfish, and emotionally damaged protagonists is nevertheless an oddly
specific one. Not only have Whitney and Asher explicitly ripped off the
design of their passive homes from artist Doug Aitken, whose designs
famously feature mirrored exteriors, there’s even a German character
clearly based on Passive House founder Wolfgang Feist who is brought in
to explain the principles of passive homes.
</p>
<p>
The show does correctly identify some of the precise anxieties of the
passive house movement. Any number of FAQs and guides to passive houses
address the exact issues that come up in <em>The Curse</em>, such as
whether you can open windows and doors
or<a href="https://blog.passivehouse-international.org/summer-comfort-passive-house/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
how homes are cooled in hot weather</a>.
</p>
<p>
One buyer on the show tosses out an induction stove because he wants to
be able to stir-fry, while in perhaps the series’s cringiest scene,
another prospective buyer couple pulls out of a deal in part because of
how long it takes for their prospective home to cool when a door is
opened. The male half of the couple is already sweating when he enters
the house and almost immediately asks for a glass of water. While trying
to air himself out, he asks if there’s enough wattage for some air
conditioning units.
</p>
<p>
“The answer to that is you don’t need one,” Whitney says, explaining
that because the home “functions like a thermos,” it will never go below
65 degrees Fahrenheit or above 78.
</p>
<p>
“But 78 is sweltering,” the man says, before Whitney and Asher explain
that because they had opened the door, it will take five to seven
<em>hours</em> for the temperature to adjust.
</p>
<p>
The scene, Dillman said, “was a really funny exaggeration, and what’s
painful is we often use the thermos analogy.”
</p>
<p>
But, she told me in a follow-up email, “I just want to say that opening
doors and windows does not create hours of discomfort. My teenagers were
horrified by that scene, as they have lived in a passive house for 12
years and have never experienced anything like that.”
</p>
<p>
Dillman noted that passive homes <em>can</em> have air conditioning and
gas ranges, although for maximum carbon reduction and air quality,
electrified cooking is best. The way the show depicts perfectionism,
meanwhile, is “rightly satirized,” she said. Still, the idea of “a
perfect home that you can’t open windows and doors,” was “really
damaging and inaccurate — funny, but inaccurate.”
</p>
<p>
Dillman said few of the projects her company works on actually clear the
passive house certification bar. “People are interested in the benefits,
but not necessarily the gold star,” she told me.
</p>
<p>
Those benefits and how they’re achieved are explained at great length in
<em>The Curse</em> — to the point that the third main character, an
unctuous reality TV producer Dougie played by Benny Safdie, just about
loses it. “This shit sucks, alright,” he says. “And it’s boring — really
boring. I’m watching a guy talk about air for four minutes.”
</p>
<p>
But <em>The Curse</em> also milks drama from some of the thornier facets
of the passive house movement, especially where it intersects with
politics. When the couple drops out of buying the sweltering home, Asher
calls another prospective buyer, who rolls up in a pickup truck sporting
a pro-cop Blue Lives Matter decal. He loves the home — other “eco” homes
he’s looked at “don’t even consider” thermal bridging, and he “love[s]
that they’re basically off the grid.”
</p>
<p>
Instead of accepting that sustainable building practices can be
appealing to people besides liberal do-gooders, Whitney — whose own
goals of getting “Flipanthropy” picked up by HGTV, increasing the value
of the real estate she and her husband own, and, most importantly,
getting people to like and respect her are only glancingly associated
with sustainability per se — goes near-catatonic with Asher.
</p>
<p>
“I actually loved that,” Dillman said. While she acknowledged that the
stereotypical buyer of a passive home is a “white, liberal, do-gooder
sustainability nut,” she also recognized that the energy independence a
passive house offers might just as obviously appeal across the political
spectrum. “It’s where the right and left somewhat come together and
really agree,” Dillman told me.
</p>
<p>
While some of the downsides of passive home construction depicted on
<em>The Curse</em> were “super inaccurate,” Dillman said, “I think
seeing the humor in it and the morality is important.”
</p>
<p>
“I mean,” she added, “it’s really terrifyingly good satire.”

Britain Blast Houthi Targets in Yemen, Killing at Least 5 Fighters</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>the pentagon — The United States, Britain and a handful of other
allies answered dozens of Houthi attacks on international shipping in
the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden with a series of powerful airstrikes
designed to severely degrade the Iranian-backed group’s
capabilities.</p>
<p>U.S. Central Command late Thursday said the series of strikes hit
more than 60 targets at 16 locations in Houthi-controlled parts of
Yemen, including command and control nodes, munitions depots, launching
systems, and production facilities.</p>
<p>“We hit them pretty hard, pretty good,” a U.S. defense official,
speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the
operation, told VOA, adding the strikes also targeted Houthi radar
installations and air defense systems which did not fire back.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Houthi rebel group said the strikes killed at
least five fighters and wounded six others, without specifying the
targets that were hit.</p>
<p>The U.S. and British strikes, carried out with the help of Australia,
Canada, the Netherlands and Bahrain, were launched from fighter jets,
surface vessels and submarines, the defense official said.</p>
<p>The U.S. alone, dropped more than 100 precision guided munitions on
the Houthi installations, officials said, with the naval vessels and
submarines firing Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles to take out the intended
targets.</p>
<p>The official also said the targets were chosen both because of their
threat to shipping and the lack of a civilian presence.</p>
<p>In a statement from the White House late Thursday, U.S. President Joe
Biden called the strikes a “direct response to unprecedented Houthi
attacks” on international shipping, saying they were necessary after
attempts at diplomacy were ignored.</p>
<p>“These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States
and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow
hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation in one of the world’s
most critical commercial routes,” Biden said. “I will not hesitate to
direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of
international commerce as necessary.”</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak likewise condemned the Houthi
attacks as destabilizing, confirming the participation of British
fighter jets in Thursday’s strikes.</p>
<p>“Their reckless actions are risking lives at sea and exacerbating the
humanitarian crisis in Yemen,” Sunak said in a statement. “This cannot
stand.”</p>
<p>It is the first time Houthi targets inside Yemen have been struck
since the militants began attacking ships in the Red Sea following
Hamas’ assault on Israel on October 7.</p>
<p>U.S. officials late Thursday were still studying the impact of the
strikes against the Houthis, but an initial assessment suggested the
damage to Houthi capabilities is “significant.”</p>
<p>“We were going after very specific capability in very specific
locations with precision munitions,” said a senior U.S. military
official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity in order
to discuss the operation.</p>
<p>“This was a significant action,” added a senior U.S. administration
official. “[We have] every expectation that it will degrade in a
significant way, the Houthis, a capability to launch exactly the sorts
of attacks that they have conducted over the period of recent
weeks.”</p>
<p>There have been 27 attacks launched from Houthi-held areas of Yemen
since mid-November, impacting citizens, cargo and vessels from more than
50 countries, according to the U.S.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said in one instance last month, U.S. defensive action
prevented a Houthi attack from hitting and likely sinking a commercial
ship full of jet fuel.</p>
<p>The most recent Houthi attack, involving the launch of an anti-ship
ballistic missile, took place earlier Thursday. The missile landed in
the Gulf of Aden near a commercial vessel, causing no injuries or
damage.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in the
Middle East and South Asia, said the Houthis launched a complex attack
using 18 one-way attack drones, two cruise missiles and one ballistic
missile from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen toward Red Sea shipping
lanes where dozens of merchant vessels were transiting.</p>
<p>U.S. combat jets, along with U.S. and British military vessels,
responded by shooting down the drones and missiles, averting any damage
to ships or injuries to their crews in the area.</p>
<p>The senior U.S. administration official said it was Tuesday’s massive
attack by the Houthis that prompted Biden to order Thursday strikes.</p>
<p>Before the U.S. and British-led strikes late Thursday, multiple U.S.
officials warned both the Houthis and Iran against what they described
as reckless and illegal behavior.</p>
<p>“There will be consequences,” Pentagon press secretary Major General
Pat Ryder said Thursday in response to a question from VOA.</p>
<p>“The Houthis are funded, trained, equipped by Iran to a large degree.
And, so, we know that Iran has a role to play in terms of helping to
cease this reckless, dangerous and illegal activity,” he said.</p>
<p>Last week, the United States and 12 allies issued a statement warning
the Houthis of unspecified consequences if their attacks on shipping in
the Red Sea continued.</p>
<p>“Let our message now be clear: We call for the immediate end of these
illegal attacks and release of unlawfully detained vessels and crews,”
the statement said.</p>
<p>Signatories on the statement included Britain, Australia, Canada,
Germany and Japan.</p>
<p>The statement followed the launch in mid-December of Operation
Prosperity Guardian by the United States, Britain and nearly 20 other
countries to protect ships from Houthi attacks.</p>
<p>Since the launch of Prosperity Guardian, at least 1,500 vessels have
passed safely through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which connects the Red
Sea with the Gulf of Aden.</p>
<p>The commander of U.S. Navy operations in the Middle East last week
called it “the largest surface and air presence in the southern Red Sea
in years.”</p>
<p>The U.N. Security Council issued its own resolution Wednesday,
calling on the Houthis to stop the attacks immediately.</p>
<p>There are questions, however, as to whether the statements, backed
now by the U.S. and British strikes against the Houthis, will do
anything to deter Tehran.</p>
<p>“Iran has the luxury of really fighting a, what I would call, a
hidden-hand operation with very few Iranians on the ground,” the former
commander of U.S. Central Command, retired General Kenneth “Frank”
McKenzie, told a webinar on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“They’re choking world shipping in the Bab el-Mandeb [Strait] at a
very low, very low price for Iran,” he said.</p>
<p>But McKenzie argued that even if Iran continues to encourage the
Houthis, the risk of a wider regional escalation is slim.</p>
<p>“I do not believe the escalation ladder leads out of Yemen. I believe
it stays in Yemen,” he said. “And I believe Iran will leave their
partners down there, their proxies down there, to their fate.”</p>
<p>U.S. officials said while they were bracing for the Houthis to try to
mount some sort of response to the strikes, a slew of initial claims of
attacks late Thursday appeared to be nothing more than
disinformation.</p>
<p>This is not the first time the U.S. military has targeted Houthi
launch sites in Yemen in response to militant attacks against vessels in
nearby waters. In October 2016, the American destroyer USS Nitze
launched Tomahawk cruise missiles at three radar sites along Yemen’s Red
Sea coast in order to degrade the Houthi’s ability to track and target
ships.</p>

Russia Trade Soared In 2023 As Commerce with US Sank</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIJING — Trade between China and Russia hit a record high in 2023,
official data from Beijing showed on Friday, as commerce with the United
States fell for the first time in four years on the back of geopolitical
tensions.</p>
<p>China-Russia trade reached more than $240 billion, customs figures
showed, overshooting a goal of $200 billion set by the neighbors in
bilateral meetings last year.</p>
<p>The figure is a record for the two countries, who have grown closer
politically and economically since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in
2022.</p>
<p>Beijing has drawn criticism from Western countries for its stance on
the Ukraine war, on which China insists it is neutral.</p>
<p>It has refused to criticize Moscow’s invasion.</p>
<p>The trade figures represented a year-on-year increase of 26.3%,
according to the data.</p>
<p>In contrast, trade between the U.S. and China fell for the first time
since 2019.</p>
<p>Commerce with the United States was valued at $664 billion last year,
down 11.6% from 2022.</p>
<p>Wang Lingjun, vice minister of the General Administration of Customs,
told a news conference that the country’s trade would face more hurdles
in 2024.</p>
<p>“The complexity, severity and uncertainty of the external environment
are on the rise, and we need to overcome the difficulties and make more
efforts to further promote the growth of foreign trade,” he said.</p>
<p>The figures also showed China’s exports fell 4.6% over the year, the
first retreat since 2016, while imports were down 5.5%.</p>
<p>Friday also saw gloomy economic figures on the domestic front, with
data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showing deflation in
China continued for the third straight month in December.</p>
<p>The consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.3% on-year.</p>
<p>China slipped into deflation in July for the first time since 2021
and following a brief rebound the following month, prices have been in
constant decline since September.</p>
<p>Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected a drop of 0.4% last month,
having sunk 0.5% in November.</p>
<p>While deflation suggests goods were cheaper, it poses a threat to the
broader economy as consumers tend to postpone purchases, hoping for
further reductions.</p>
<p>A lack of demand can then force companies to cut production, freeze
hiring or lay off workers, while potentially also having to discount
existing stocks – dampening profitability even as costs remain the
same.</p>
<p>By way of comparison, inflation in the United States stood at 3.4% in
December.</p>
<p>Inflation in China for the whole of 2023 rose by an average of 0.2%,
in contrast to other major economies, which saw prices soar once
again.</p>
<p>The NBS also said producer prices sank 2.7%, the 15th consecutive
month of declines.</p>
<p>The PPI index, which measures the cost of goods leaving factories and
provides an insight into the health of the economy, fell 3% in
November.</p>

id="us-britain-blast-dozens-of-houthi-targets-in-yemen-in-retaliatory-strikes">US,
Britain Blast Dozens of Houthi Targets in Yemen in Retaliatory
Strikes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>the pentagon — The United States, Britain and a handful of other
allies answered dozens of Houthi attacks on international shipping in
the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden with a series of powerful airstrikes
designed to severely degrade the Iranian-backed group’s
capabilities.</p>
<p>U.S. Central Command late Thursday said the series of strikes hit
more than 60 targets at 16 locations in Houthi-controlled parts of
Yemen, including command and control nodes, munitions depots, launching
systems, and production facilities.</p>
<p>“We hit them pretty hard, pretty good,” a U.S. defense official,
speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the
operation, told VOA, adding the strikes also targeted Houthi radar
installations and air defense systems which did not fire back.</p>
<p>The U.S. and British strikes, carried out with the help of Australia,
Canada, the Netherlands and Bahrain, were launched from fighter jets,
surface vessels and submarines, the defense official said.</p>
<p>The U.S. alone, dropped more than 100 precision guided munitions on
the Houthi installations, officials said, with the naval vessels and
submarines firing Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles to take out the intended
targets.</p>
<p>The official also said the targets were chosen both because of their
threat to shipping and the lack of a civilian presence.</p>
<p>In a statement from the White House late Thursday, U.S. President Joe
Biden called the strikes a “direct response to unprecedented Houthi
attacks” on international shipping, saying they were necessary after
attempts at diplomacy were ignored.</p>
<p>“These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States
and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow
hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation in one of the world’s
most critical commercial routes,” Biden said. “I will not hesitate to
direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of
international commerce as necessary.”</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak likewise condemned the Houthi
attacks as destabilizing, confirming the participation of British
fighter jets in Thursday’s strikes.</p>
<p>“Their reckless actions are risking lives at sea and exacerbating the
humanitarian crisis in Yemen,” Sunak said in a statement. “This cannot
stand.”</p>
<p>It is the first time Houthi targets inside Yemen have been struck
since the militants began attacking ships in the Red Sea following
Hamas’ assault on Israel on October 7.</p>
<p>U.S. officials late Thursday were still studying the impact of the
strikes against the Houthis, but an initial assessment suggested the
damage to Houthi capabilities is “significant.”</p>
<p>“We were going after very specific capability in very specific
locations with precision munitions,” said a senior U.S. military
official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity in order
to discuss the operation.</p>
<p>“This was a significant action,” added a senior U.S. administration
official. “[We have] every expectation that it will degrade in a
significant way, the Houthis, a capability to launch exactly the sorts
of attacks that they have conducted over the period of recent
weeks.”</p>
<p>There have been 27 attacks launched from Houthi-held areas of Yemen
since mid-November, impacting citizens, cargo and vessels from more than
50 countries, according to the U.S.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said in one instance last month, U.S. defensive action
prevented a Houthi attack from hitting and likely sinking a commercial
ship full of jet fuel.</p>
<p>The most recent Houthi attack, involving the launch of an anti-ship
ballistic missile, took place earlier Thursday. The missile landed in
the Gulf of Aden near a commercial vessel, causing no injuries or
damage.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in the
Middle East and South Asia, said the Houthis launched a complex attack
using 18 one-way attack drones, two cruise missiles and one ballistic
missile from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen toward Red Sea shipping
lanes where dozens of merchant vessels were transiting.</p>
<p>U.S. combat jets, along with U.S. and British military vessels,
responded by shooting down the drones and missiles, averting any damage
to ships or injuries to their crews in the area.</p>
<p>The senior U.S. administration official said it was Tuesday’s massive
attack by the Houthis that prompted Biden to order Thursday strikes.</p>
<p>Before the U.S. and British-led strikes late Thursday, multiple U.S.
officials warned both the Houthis and Iran against what they described
as reckless and illegal behavior.</p>
<p>“There will be consequences,” Pentagon press secretary Major General
Pat Ryder said Thursday in response to a question from VOA.</p>
<p>“The Houthis are funded, trained, equipped by Iran to a large degree.
And, so, we know that Iran has a role to play in terms of helping to
cease this reckless, dangerous and illegal activity,” he said.</p>
<p>Last week, the United States and 12 allies issued a statement warning
the Houthis of unspecified consequences if their attacks on shipping in
the Red Sea continued.</p>
<p>“Let our message now be clear: We call for the immediate end of these
illegal attacks and release of unlawfully detained vessels and crews,”
the statement said.</p>
<p>Signatories on the statement included Britain, Australia, Canada,
Germany and Japan.</p>
<p>The statement followed the launch in mid-December of Operation
Prosperity Guardian by the United States, Britain and nearly 20 other
countries to protect ships from Houthi attacks.</p>
<p>Since the launch of Prosperity Guardian, at least 1,500 vessels have
passed safely through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which connects the Red
Sea with the Gulf of Aden.</p>
<p>The commander of U.S. Navy operations in the Middle East last week
called it “the largest surface and air presence in the southern Red Sea
in years.”</p>
<p>The U.N. Security Council issued its own resolution Wednesday,
calling on the Houthis to stop the attacks immediately.</p>
<p>There are questions, however, as to whether the statements, backed
now by the U.S. and British strikes against the Houthis, will do
anything to deter Tehran.</p>
<p>“Iran has the luxury of really fighting a, what I would call, a
hidden-hand operation with very few Iranians on the ground,” the former
commander of U.S. Central Command, retired General Kenneth “Frank”
McKenzie, told a webinar on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“They’re choking world shipping in the Bab el-Mandeb [Strait] at a
very low, very low price for Iran,” he said.</p>
<p>But McKenzie argued that even if Iran continues to encourage the
Houthis, the risk of a wider regional escalation is slim.</p>
<p>“I do not believe the escalation ladder leads out of Yemen. I believe
it stays in Yemen,” he said. “And I believe Iran will leave their
partners down there, their proxies down there, to their fate.”</p>
<p>U.S. officials said while they were bracing for the Houthis to try to
mount some sort of response to the strikes, a slew of initial claims of
attacks late Thursday appeared to be nothing more than
disinformation.</p>
<p>This is not the first time the U.S. military has targeted Houthi
launch sites in Yemen in response to militant attacks against vessels in
nearby waters. In October 2016, the American destroyer USS Nitze
launched Tomahawk cruise missiles at three radar sites along Yemen’s Red
Sea coast in order to degrade the Houthi’s ability to track and target
ships.</p>

<p>PORTLAND, Ore. — Tyrone McDougald wore a long-eared, leopard-print
hat as he sorted through racks of warm clothes at a homeless service
center in Portland, Oregon. He was already wearing multiple layers, but
with no roof of his own, he grabbed two more coats to help him face a
bitter cold snap arriving in the Northwest.</p>
<p>“I’m hoping that I can get in a shelter,” he said. “That would
relieve a lot of the burden.”</p>
<p>An approaching storm was expected to deliver snow to Portland, a city
more accustomed to winter rain, by Saturday. It’s one of a number of
sprawling storms bringing everything from what the National Weather
Service called “life-threatening wind chills” in South Dakota to the
possibility of tornadoes in the South.</p>
<p>School and flights were canceled in advance in parts of the South and
Midwest. Republican candidates campaigning ahead of Monday’s Iowa
caucuses were contending with a blizzard warning covering most of the
state, and Nikki Haley’s campaign canceled three Friday events and said
it would be hosting “telephone town halls.”</p>
<p>Advocates were particularly worried about homeless people as well as
older residents who might be snowed or iced in, especially in the
Pacific Northwest, where the winters are typically mild.</p>
<p>In one hour Thursday, during the lunch service at Blanchet House, a
homeless services nonprofit in Portland, about 165 warm clothing items
were claimed — including the coats McDougald grabbed.</p>
<p>Julie Showers, the nonprofit’s spokesperson, said people were
desperate for dry clothes and shoes after days of cold rain.</p>
<p>“We worry about frostbite, hypothermia,” she said. “There are a lot
of people experiencing homelessness in Portland that are in mental
health crisis … and slowly become hypothermic laying on the street
because they don’t understand how cold it’s getting.”</p>
<p>McDougald said he’s spent the past two years unhoused: “I’m hoping I
don’t have to do another whole winter out here.”</p>
<p>In the Chicago area, which could see more than 15 centimeters of snow
by Saturday, advocates also worried for the growing population of
migrants sent up from the U.S.-Mexico border. Hundreds are staying in
eight parked “warming buses” to avoid sleeping outside while they await
space in city-run shelters.</p>
<p>Among them was Angelo Travieso, a Venezuelan bused up from Texas. He
wore a light jacket and sandals with socks.</p>
<p>“I slept sitting because there is almost no space left,” he said.
“The buses are also small and you practically have to stay inside
because of the heating, because it is deadly cold outside.”</p>
<p>In Portland and Seattle, temperature highs were expected to hover
around zero to -3.3 Celsius and lows in the low 20s and about -5 C to
-7.7 C from Friday through at least Monday.</p>
<p>The homelessness agency in King County, home to Seattle, activated
its highest tier of severe weather operations through at least Tuesday,
working with cities to open 24/7 shelters and with transit partners to
provide transportation to shelters.</p>
<p>Seattle City Hall served as a shelter for up to 40 people Thursday
night.</p>
<p>Multnomah County, home to Portland, provided outreach groups earlier
in the week with clothing and cold weather supplies to distribute to
people living outside, including wool blankets, tarps, tents and
sleeping bags, said spokesperson Denis Theriault.</p>
<p>Cold spells in the past have been deadly for Portland’s homeless
population. Two people died of cold in 2022, an annual county report on
homeless deaths found. That was down from eight deaths from hypothermia
in 2021 — the same year four people also died of overheating during the
unprecedented and devastating “heat dome” that saw temperatures soar to
an all-time high of 46.7 Celsius in Portland and smashed heat records
across the region. The heat wave killed hundreds across Oregon,
Washington and British Columbia.</p>
<p>Portland winters do not include regular or extended periods of snow,
so the city’s transportation department only salts or de-ices about a
third of the street grid.</p>
<p>Past snow and ice storms have effectively paralyzed the city,
including in 2017 and in 2021, when freezing rain coated roads in
dangerous ice and many ice-laden trees snapped and fell on power lines,
cutting power to hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
<p>Last February, nearly 28 centimeters fell in what amounted to the
second snowiest day in the city’s history, taking drivers by surprise
and stranding them on freeways for hours.</p>
<p>Norman Chusid, owner of the Ankeny Hardware in southeast Portland,
said he had to keep his store open two hours past closing on Wednesday
to serve all the customers. The store has been selling 3 to 5 tons of
ice melt every day, he said.</p>
<p>“Snow shovels have been going like crazy,” he said.</p>
<p>At higher elevations, heavy snow, high winds and whiteout conditions
were expected to envelop the Cascade Mountains and make travel “very
difficult to impossible,” the weather service said. Fresh snow already
blanketed the Cascades earlier in the week.</p>
<p>An avalanche at a ski resort near Lake Tahoe in California on
Wednesday swept up four people, killing one.</p>
<p>Outside a tent in Seattle’s International District on Thursday, David
Dodds said he had lots of experience in the cold: He’d been homeless in
Alaska.</p>
<p>“During the cold snaps, maybe that’d be time to make a new friend or
two,” he said. “Two warm bodies under the same blanket will go a long
ways. … This cold, when temperature drops, it’s no joke, and you can
wind up dead.”</p>

<p>This is a Rom Image and hard disc image of RISC OS, built from the

uses code from approx 2000-2002, compiled up with a set of contempory

the emulator RPCEmu. ↫ Peter Howkins I’m not particularly well-versed in

<p>date: 2024-01-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>While GNU Hurd predates the Linux kernel, its hardware support has
been woefully behind with very limited and dated hardware support
compared to modern PC/server hardware. Not only that, its been largely
x86 limited but during Q4’2023 the developers involved have made
progress on x86_64 support and begun tackling AArch64 porting. Developer
Samuel Thibault shared that the GNU Hurd 64-bit port now has enough
packages in the debian-ports archive to be able to bootstrap a chroot. A
64-bit Debian + GNU Hurd build daemon is getting setup and the other
infrastructure work is coming along. ↫ Michael Larabel In addition, work
has started to port Hurd to POWER9, and someone is working on bringing
the Ladybird web browser to Hurd, for a more modern browsing experience,
among many other points of progress.</p>

better collect feedback on usability and focus on completing the

Casual ableism aside, that phrase “Your life is just a series of your

I’ve had some recent experiences with people wealthier than me where I
felt this acutely. Nothing malicious, but a realization of “Oh, that’s
not a concern for you.” You or your kids want some expensive thing but
it’d be fun? Buy now. Don’t like paying taxes and want a workaround? Buy
now. Don’t like something about your house or car or body? Buy now.

<p>
To be fair, I see this effect of wealth in my own life too. Don’t want
to <em>make dinner</em> or <em>drive to a restaurant</em>? Then don’t!
That’s for the plebeians. I would <em>prefer not to</em> so I’ll use my
tech salary to have a person on a gig app do that for me. I will – for a

<h2 id="us-uk-strike-back-at-several-houthi-sites-in-yemen">US, UK
Strike Back at Several Houthi Sites in Yemen</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>pentagon — The United States and Britain have launched a massive
attack against Iranian-backed Houthis inside Yemen in retaliation for
more than two dozen recent attacks against vessels transiting
international shipping lanes in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.</p>
<p>A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were
not authorized to speak to the press, said American and British military
assets struck more than a dozen Houthi targets Thursday, ranging from
radar systems and airfields to drone and missile storage sites.   </p>
<p>“We hit them pretty hard, pretty good,” a U.S. defense official,
likewise talking on the condition of anonymity, told VOA, adding the
strikes also targeted Houthi radar installations and air defense systems
which did not fire back.</p>
<p>The U.S. and British strikes, carried out with the help of Australia,
Canada, the Netherlands and Bahrain, were launched from fighter jets,
surface vessels and submarines, the defense official said.</p>
<p>The official also said the targets were chosen both because of their
threat to shipping and the lack of a civilian presence.</p>
<p>In a statement from the White House late Thursday, U.S. President Joe
Biden called the strikes a “direct response to unprecedented Houthi
attacks” on international shipping, saying they were necessary after
attempts at diplomacy were ignored.</p>
<p>“These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States
and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow
hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation in one of the world’s
most critical commercial routes,” Biden said. “I will not hesitate to
direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of
international commerce as necessary.”</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak likewise condemned the Houthi
attacks as destabilizing, confirming the participation of British
fighter jets in Thursday’s strikes.</p>
<p>“Their reckless actions are risking lives at sea and exacerbating the
humanitarian crisis in Yemen,” Sunak said in a statement. “This cannot
stand.”</p>
<p>It is the first time Houthi targets inside Yemen have been struck
since the militants began attacking ships in the Red Sea following
Hamas’ assault on Israel on October 7.</p>
<p>U.S. officials late Thursday were still studying the impact of the
strikes against the Houthis, but an initial assessment suggested the
damage to Houthi capabilities is “significant.”</p>
<p>“We were going after very specific capability in very specific
locations with precision munitions,” said a senior U.S. military
official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity in order
to discuss the operation.</p>
<p>“This was a significant action,” added a senior U.S. administration
official. “[We have] every expectation that it will degrade in a
significant way, the Houthis, a capability to launch exactly the sorts
of attacks that they have conducted over the period of recent
weeks.”</p>
<p>There have been 27 attacks launched from Houthi-held areas of Yemen
since mid-November, impacting citizens, cargo and vessels from more than
50 countries, according to the U.S.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said in one instance last month, U.S. defensive action
prevented a Houthi attack from hitting and likely sinking a commercial
ship full of jet fuel.</p>
<p>The most recent Houthi attack, involving the launch of an anti-ship
ballistic missile, took place earlier Thursday. The missile landed in
the Gulf of Aden near a commercial vessel, causing no injuries or
damage.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in the
Middle East and South Asia, said the Houthis launched a complex attack
using 18 one-way attack drones, two cruise missiles and one ballistic
missile from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen toward Red Sea shipping
lanes where dozens of merchant vessels were transiting.</p>
<p>U.S. combat jets, along with U.S. and British military vessels,
responded by shooting down the drones and missiles, averting any damage
to ships or injuries to their crews in the area.</p>
<p>The senior U.S. administration official said it was Tuesday’s massive
attack by the Houthis that prompted Biden to order Thursday strikes.</p>
<p>Before the U.S. and British-led strikes late Thursday, multiple U.S.
officials warned both the Houthis and Iran against what they described
as reckless and illegal behavior.</p>
<p>“There will be consequences,” Pentagon press secretary Major General
Pat Ryder said Thursday in response to a question from VOA.</p>
<p>“The Houthis are funded, trained, equipped by Iran to a large degree.
And, so, we know that Iran has a role to play in terms of helping to
cease this reckless, dangerous and illegal activity,” he said.</p>
<p>Last week, the United States and 12 allies issued a statement warning
the Houthis of unspecified consequences if their attacks on shipping in
the Red Sea continued.</p>
<p>“Let our message now be clear: We call for the immediate end of these
illegal attacks and release of unlawfully detained vessels and
crews,” the statement said.</p>
<p>Signatories on the statement included Britain, Australia, Canada,
Germany and Japan.</p>
<p>The statement followed the launch in mid-December of Operation
Prosperity Guardian by the United States, Britain and nearly 20 other
countries to protect ships from Houthi attacks.</p>
<p>Since the launch of Prosperity Guardian, at least 1,500 vessels have
passed safely through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which connects the Red
Sea with the Gulf of Aden.</p>
<p>The commander of U.S. Navy operations in the Middle East last week
called it “the largest surface and air presence in the southern Red Sea
in years.” </p>
<p>The U.N. Security Council issued its own resolution Wednesday,
calling on the Houthis to stop the attacks immediately.</p>
<p>There are questions, however, as to whether the statements, backed
now by the U.S. and British strikes against the Houthis, will do
anything to deter Tehran.</p>
<p>“Iran has the luxury of really fighting a, what I would call, a
hidden-hand operation with very few Iranians on the ground,” the former
commander of U.S. Central Command, retired General Kenneth
“Frank” McKenzie, told a webinar on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“They’re choking world shipping in the Bab el-Mandeb [Strait] at a
very low, very low price for Iran,” he said.</p>
<p>But McKenzie argued that even if Iran continues to encourage the
Houthis, the risk of a wider regional escalation is slim.</p>
<p>“I do not believe the escalation ladder leads out of Yemen. I believe
it stays in Yemen,” he said. “And I believe Iran will leave their
partners down there, their proxies down there, to their fate.” </p>
<p>U.S. officials said while they were bracing for the Houthis to try to
mount some sort of response to the strikes, a slew of initial claims of
attacks late Thursday appeared to be nothing more than
disinformation.</p>
<p>This is not the first time the U.S. military has targeted Houthi
launch sites in Yemen in response to militant attacks against vessels in
nearby waters. In October 2016, the American destroyer USS Nitze
launched Tomahawk cruise missiles at three radar sites along Yemen’s Red
Sea coast in order to degrade the Houthi’s ability to track and target
ships.</p>

report.</p>

<h2 id="dropout">Dropout</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-12, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
Have you heard about <a href="http://dropout.tv">Dropout</a>? Spun off
from College Humor, Dropout is a paid streaming service with hours and
hours of high quality improv content. For $6/month (less than half a
Netflix) you get access to a large swath of independently produced shows
that are a guaranteed laugh.
</p>
<p>
Here’s five shows I love on Dropout and chances are if you’re reading
this, you’d like them too.
</p>
<h2>
Game Changer
</h2>
<p>
Game Changer is a game show where the contestants don’t know what game
they’re playing until the show starts. The contestants are all College
Humor talent and have comedy and improv skills in spades.

</two-column>
<p>
The series has reached new heights in the last two seasons with even
more ambitious games, including but not limited to: a <em>The
Bachelor</em> clone, a <em>Survivor</em> clone,
<a href="https://youtu.be/VbF1AJPqP1M">an improvised musical</a>, a
surprise escape room, an improvised Shakespearean play, and many more.
</p>
<h2>
Make Some Noise
</h2>
<p>
A spin-off of Game Changer, this show is pure improv in the exact style
of “Whose Line Is It Anyway?” This is my favorite of all the shows.
Pure, corny, improv games. There’s even an improv karaoke episode with
Wayne Brady from the US version of <em>Whose Line</em> to tie up the
head nod perfectly.

<p>
Just when you think you’ve seen all the goofs to be goofed, newer cast
members like Jake Wysocki and Vic Michaelis show up to inject new life
and take it even further over the top.
</p>
<h2>
Play It By Ear

<p>
Another Game Changer spin-off, Play It By Ear is a 30-minute five act
improv musical. All you fellow thespians out there will love it.

<h2>
Dimension 20
</h2>
<p>
Say hi, intrepid heroes! Dimension 20 is an “actual play” series where
comedians play DnD. It’s got great set pieces, funny goofs and top tier
DMs like Brennan Lee Mulligan and Aabria Iyengar. I started with Tiny
Heist featuring the McElroy Brothers (and their dad) from The Adventure
Zone podcast and would recommend that as a starting point, but they’re
all fun and have different settings, stories, and players. I’m sure you
can find one you like.

<h2>
Total Forgiveness
</h2>
<p>
Now for something completely different. Total Forgiveness is a show
about how far two people would go to forgive their student loans. Grant
and Ally subject each other to weekly dares that prey on each other’s
fears and insecurities approaching Jackass levels of impropriety.

<h2>
Supporting small production companies
</h2>
<p>
Production on new Dropout content stopped during to the WGA and
SAG-AFTRA strikes. Being web content, Dropout was technically exempt
from the strike but decided to stand in solidarity with their writers
and actors. That’s an admirable move for a small production company.
</p>
<p>
It’s fun to support smaller media ventures and Dropout feels like one of
the chaotic good ones. You can even
<a href="https://www.dropout.tv/checkout/subscribe/gift?code=dropoutfullyear&amp;plan=yearly">gift
a subscription</a> to someone in your life who likes TTRPGs or improv
comedy (or both). Highly recommend. There’s also a lot of free episodes
on YouTube, so hopefully this post has already blessed your algorithm.

strong biofilm and multi-virulent vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus via natural alkaloid-based porous nanoparticles: perspective
towards near future eradication</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-12, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
As a growing direction, nano-based therapy has become a successful
paradigm used to address the phytogenic delivery-related problems in
overcoming multivirulent vancomycin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus
aureus</italic> (VRSA) infection.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
Hence, our aim was to develop and assess a novel nanocarrier system
(mesoporous silica nanoparticles, MPS-NPs) for free berberine (Free-BR)
as an antimicrobial alkaloid against strong biofilm-producing and
multi-virulent VRSA strains using <italic>in vitro</italic> and
<italic>in vivo</italic> mouse model.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results and discussion
</title>
<p>
Our outcomes demonstrated vancomycin resistance in 13.7% of
<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic>S. aureus</italic>)
strains categorized as VRSA. Notably, strong biofilm formation was
observed in 69.2% of VRSA strains that were all positive for
<italic>icaA</italic> gene. All strong biofilm-producing VRSA strains
harbored a minimum of two virulence genes comprising
<italic>clfA</italic> and <italic>icaA</italic> with 44.4% of them
possessing all five virulence genes (<italic>icaA</italic>,
<italic>tst</italic>, <italic>clfA</italic>, <italic>hla</italic>, and
<italic>pvl</italic>), and 88.9% being multi-virulent. The study
findings affirmed excellent <italic>in vitro</italic> antimicrobial and
antibiofilm properties of BR-loaded MPS-NPs. Real-time quantitative
reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assay displayed the downregulating
role of BR-loaded MPS-NPs on strong biofilm-producing and multi-virulent
VRSA strains virulence and <italic>agr</italic> genes in both <italic>in
vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> mice models. Additionally,
BR-loaded MPS-NPs supplementation has a promising role in attenuating
the upregulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines’ genes in
VRSA-infected mice with attenuation in pro-apoptotic genes expression
resulting in reduced VRSA-induced apoptosis. In essence, the current
study recommends the future scope of using BR-loaded MPS-NPs as
auspicious alternatives for antimicrobials with tremendous
antimicrobial, antibiofilm, anti-quorum sensing (QS), and anti-virulence
effectiveness against problematic strong biofilm-producing and
multi-virulent VRSA-associated infections.

id="mucosal-microbiome-of-surgically-treated-terminal-ileal-crohns-disease">Mucosal
microbiome of surgically treated terminal ileal Crohn’s disease</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-12, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Crohn’s disease (CD) is associated with changes in the microbiome. The
role of these changes and their precise association with disease course
and activity remain ambiguous. In this prospective single-center study,
the mucosal microbiome of surgical CD and non-CD patients was compared
at the time of surgery. Microbial analyses were individually performed
for ileal and colonic tissue samples obtained during surgery using
16S-rRNA-gene amplicon sequencing. Three groups out of the 46 included
patients were formed: 1) a study group of CD of patients who received
ileocecal resection due to CD involvement (CD study, n=10); 2) a control
group of non-CD of patients who received intestinal resection due to
indications other than CD (non-CD control, n=27); and 3) a second
control group of CD who underwent resection of the intestine not
affected by CD (CD non-affected control, n=9). Species richness and
Shannon diversity were not different between all formed groups and
regions analyzed (p&gt;0.05). Several significant taxonomic differences
were seen at the phylum-, order-, and genus-levels between the formed
groups, such as a decrease of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> (phylum-level)
and an increase of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and
<italic>Escherichia/Shigella/Pseudescherichia</italic> (genus-level) in
CD study – colon vs. the non-CD control – colon (p ≤ 0.05). The CD
non-affected control presented the largest amount of differentially
abundant taxa in comparison to the other groups. These results underline
that CD is accompanied by changes in affected and non-affected
intestinal regions compared to non-CD controls. This study contributes
the mucosal microbiome of a well-defined subset of surgical CD patients
without confounding aspects of the fecal microbiome or regional
microbial differences to the existing literature.

id="dissecting-exp2-sequence-requirements-for-protein-export-in-malaria-parasites">Dissecting
EXP2 sequence requirements for protein export in malaria parasites</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-12, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Apicomplexan parasites that reside within a parasitophorous vacuole
harbor a conserved pore-forming protein that enables small-molecule
transfer across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM). In
<italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites that cause malaria, this nutrient
pore is formed by EXP2 which can complement the function of GRA17, an
orthologous protein in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii.</italic> EXP2,
however, has an additional function in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>
parasites, serving also as the pore-forming component of the protein
export machinery PTEX. To examine how EXP2 can play this additional
role, transgenes that encoded truncations of EXP2, GRA17, hybrid
GRA17-EXP2, or EXP2 under the transcriptional control of different
promoters were expressed in EXP2 knockdown parasites to determine which
could complement EXP2 function. This revealed that EXP2 is a unique
pore-forming protein, and its protein export role in <italic>P.
falciparum</italic> cannot be complemented by <italic>T. gondii</italic>
GRA17. This was despite the addition of the EXP2 assembly strand and
part of the linker helix to GRA17, which are regions necessary for the
interaction of EXP2 with the other core PTEX components. This indicates
that the body region of EXP2 plays a critical role in PTEX assembly
and/or that the absence of other <italic>T. gondii</italic> GRA proteins
in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> leads to its reduced efficiency of
insertion into the PVM and complementation potential. Altering the
timing and abundance of EXP2 expression did not affect protein export
but affected parasite viability, indicating that the unique
transcriptional profile of EXP2 when compared to other PTEX components
enables it to serve an additional role in nutrient exchange.

id="characteristics-of-the-gut-microbiota-of-patients-with-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-plaques-positive-for-bacterial-genetic-material">Characteristics
of the gut microbiota of patients with symptomatic carotid
atherosclerotic plaques positive for bacterial genetic material</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-12, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
The gut microbiota (GM) is believed to be closely associated with
symptomatic carotid atherosclerosis (SCAS), yet more evidence is needed
to substantiate the significant role of GM in SCAS. This study, based on
the detection of bacterial DNA in carotid plaques, explores the
characteristics of GM in SCAS patients with plaque bacterial genetic
material positivity, aiming to provide a reference for subsequent
research.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We enrolled 27 healthy individuals (NHF group) and 23 SCAS patients
(PFBS group). We utilized 16S rDNA V3-V4 region gene sequencing to
analyze the microbiota in fecal samples from both groups, as well as in
plaque samples from the carotid bifurcation extending to the origin of
the internal carotid artery in all patients.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Our results indicate significant differences in the gut microbiota (GM)
between SCAS patients and healthy individuals. The detection rate of
bacterial DNA in plaque samples was approximately 26%. Compared to
patients with negative plaques (PRSOPWNP group), those with positive
plaques (PRSOPWPP group) exhibited significant alterations in their GM,
particularly an upregulation of 11 bacterial genera (such as Klebsiella
and Streptococcus) in the gut, which were also present in the plaques.
In terms of microbial gene function prediction, pathways such as
Fluorobenzoate degradation were significantly upregulated in the GM of
patients with positive plaques.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
In summary, our study is the first to identify significant alterations
in the gut microbiota of patients with positive plaques, providing
crucial microbial evidence for further exploration of the pathogenesis
of SCAS.

genomic analysis of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes in
Staphylococcus aureus isolates from patients and retail meat</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-12, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is a significant human pathogen
that poses a threat to public health due to its association with
foodborne contamination and a variety of infections. The factors
contributing to the pathogenicity of <italic>S. aureus</italic> include
virulence, drug resistance, and toxin production, making it essential to
monitor their prevalence and genetic profiles. This study investigated
and compared the genomic characteristics of <italic>S. aureus</italic>
isolates from retail meat and patients in Saudi Arabia.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
A total of 136 <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates were obtained between
October 2021 and June 2022:84 from patients and 53 from meat samples in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates were
identified using conventional methods and MALDI-TOF MS, and
methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) was identified
using VITEK2 and BD Phoenix systems. MRSA was confirmed phenotypically
using chromogenic agar, and genotypically by detecting
<italic>mec</italic>A. Genomic data were analyzed using BactopiaV2
pipeline, local BLAST, and MLST databases.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Antibiotic resistance genes were prevalent in both meat and patient
<italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates, with high prevalence of
<italic>tet</italic>38, <italic>bla</italic>Z, and
<italic>fos</italic>B. Notably, all <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates
from patients carried multidrug-resistant (MDR) genes, and a high
percentage of <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates from meat also
harbored MDR genes. Phenotypically, 43% of the <italic>S.
aureus</italic> isolates from meat and 100% of the patients’ isolates
were MDR. Enterotoxin genes, including <italic>sel</italic>X,
<italic>sem</italic>, and <italic>sei</italic>, exhibited high
compatibility between meat and patient <italic>S. aureus</italic>
isolates. Virulence genes such as <italic>cap, hly/hla, sbi</italic>,
and <italic>isd</italic> were found in all <italic>S. aureus</italic>
isolates from both sources.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Our study established a genetic connection between <italic>S.
aureus</italic> isolates from meat and patients, showing shared
antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. The presence of these genes
in meat derived isolates underscores its role as a reservoir. Genomic
relatedness also suggests potential transmission of resistance between
different settings. These findings emphasize the necessity for a
comprehensive approach to monitor and control <italic>S. aureus</italic>
infections in both animals and humans.

id="functional-characterization-of-plasmodium-vivax-hexose-transporter-1">Functional
characterization of Plasmodium vivax hexose transporter 1</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-12, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
<italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> is the most widely distributed human
malaria parasite. The eradication of vivax malaria remains challenging
due to transmission of drug-resistant parasite and dormant liver form.
Consequently, anti-malarial drugs with novel mechanisms of action are
urgently demanded. Glucose uptake blocking strategy is suggested as a
novel mode of action that leads to selective starvation in various
species of malaria parasites. The role of hexose transporter 1 in
<italic>Plasmodium</italic> species is glucose uptake, and its blocking
strategies proved to successfully induce selective starvation. However,
there is limited information on the glucose uptake properties via
<italic>P. vivax</italic> hexose transporter 1 (PvHT1). Thus, we focused
on the PvHT1 to precisely identify its properties of glucose uptake. The
PvHT1 North Korean strain (PvHT1<sub>NK</sub>) expressed <italic>Xenopus
laevis</italic> oocytes mediating the transport of [<sup>3</sup>H]
deoxy-D-glucose (ddGlu) in an expression and incubation time-dependent
manner without sodium dependency. Moreover, the PvHT1<sub>NK</sub>
showed no exchange mode of glucose in efflux experiments and
concentration-dependent results showed saturable kinetics following the
Michaelis-Menten equation. Non-linear regression analysis revealed a Km
value of 294.1 μM and a Vmax value of 1,060 pmol/oocyte/hr, and
inhibition experiments showed a strong inhibitory effect by glucose,
mannose, and ddGlu. Additionally, weak inhibition was observed with
fructose and galactose. Comparison of amino acid sequence and tertiary
structure between <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P.
vivax</italic> HT1 revealed a completely conserved residue in glucose
binding pocket. This result supported that the glucose uptake properties
are similar to <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, and PfHT1 inhibitor
(compound 3361) works in <italic>P. vivax</italic>. These findings
provide properties of glucose uptake via PvHT1<sub>NK</sub> for
carbohydrate metabolism and support the approaches to vivax malaria drug
development strategy targeting the PvHT1 for starving of the parasite.
