November 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: O’Reilly Radar</p>
<p>October had many language model releases. The mid-size models, and
even the small models, are catching up to frontier models like GPT-4.5o
in performance. But the release that blew us all away wasn’t a language
model: It was Claude’s computer use API. Computer use allows you to
teach Claude how to use a computer: how […]</p>

<h2 id="ghc-9.12.1-alpha2-is-now-available">GHC 9.12.1-alpha2 is now
available</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: Glasgow Haskell Compiler</p>
<h1>
GHC 9.12.1-alpha2 is now available
</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">
Zubin Duggal - 2024-11-05
</h4>
<p>
The GHC developers are very pleased to announce the availability of the
second alpha release of GHC 9.12.1. Binary distributions, source
distributions, and documentation are available at
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.1-alpha2">downloads.haskell.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
We hope to have this release available via ghcup shortly.
</p>
<p>
GHC 9.12 will bring a number of new features and improvements,
including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The new language extension
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0522-or-patterns.rst">OrPatterns</a>
allowing you to combine multiple pattern clauses into one.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0569-multiline-strings.rst">MultilineStrings</a>
language extension to allow you to more easily write strings spanning
multiple lines in your source code.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Improvements to the OverloadedRecordDot extension, allowing the built-in
<code>HasField</code> class to be used for records with fields of non
lifted representations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0409-exportable-named-default.rst">NamedDefaults</a>
language extension has been introduced allowing you to define defaults
for typeclasses other than <code>Num</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
More deterministic object code output, controlled by the
<code>-fobject-determinism</code> flag, which improves determinism of
builds a lot (though does not fully do so) at the cost of some compiler
performance (1-2%). See
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/12935">#12935</a> for
the details
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
GHC now accepts type syntax in expressions as part of
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0281-visible-forall.rst">GHC
Proposal <span>#281</span></a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The WASM backend now has support for TemplateHaskell.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
… and many more
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A full accounting of changes can be found in the
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.1-alpha2/docs/users_guide/9.12.1-notes.html">release
notes</a>. As always, GHC’s release status, including planned future
releases, can be found on the GHC Wiki
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/GHC-status">status</a>.
</p>
<p>
We would like to thank GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake pool, Well-Typed,
Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, the Haskell Foundation, and
other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial and in-kind
support has facilitated GHC maintenance and release management over the
years. Finally, this release would not have been possible without the
hundreds of open-source contributors whose work comprise this release.
</p>
<p>
As always, do give this release a try and open a
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if
you see anything amiss.

<h2 id="notes-on-binary-soup">Notes on binary soup</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: Marginallia log</p>
<p>I recently put together a small library called Slop, for intermediate
on-disk data representation for the search engine, replacing a few
ad-hoc formats I had in place before. This post isn’t so much an attempt
to convince anyone else to use this library, as it makes trade-offs
catering to a fairly niche use case, but to explore some of its design
ideas, as it all came together very nicely, in the hopes that other
libraries can draw ideas from it.</p>
