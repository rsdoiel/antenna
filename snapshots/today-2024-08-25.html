Street Week Ahead — ‘Super Bowl’ Nvidia earnings stand to test searing
AI trade</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — The rally in U.S. stocks faces an important test […]  with
earnings from chipmaking giant Nvidia NVDA.O, whose blistering run has
powered markets throughout 2024.  </p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 .SPX has pared a sharp drop it suffered after U.S.
economic worries contributed to a sell-off at the beginning of the month
and again stands near a fresh all-time high.  </p>
<p>Nvidia, whose chips are widely seen as the gold standard in
artificial intelligence, has been at the forefront of that rally,
jumping by more than 30% since its recent lows. The stock is up some
150% year-to-date, accounting for around a quarter of the S&amp;P 500’s
17% year-to-date gain.  </p>
<p>The company’s Aug. 28 earnings report, coupled with guidance on
whether it expects corporate investments in AI to continue, could be a
key inflection point for market sentiment heading into what is
historically a volatile time of the year. The S&amp;P 500 has fallen in
September by an average of 0.78% since World War Two, the worst
performance of any month, according to CFRA data.  </p>
<p>“Nvidia is the zeitgeist stock today,” said Mike Smith, a portfolio
manager at Allspring Global Investments, which holds the company’s
shares in its portfolios. “You can think of their earnings four times a
year as the Super Bowl.”  </p>
<p>Some investors are getting ready for fireworks. Traders are pricing
in a swing of around 10.3% in Nvidia’s shares the day after the company
reports earnings, according to data from options analytic firm ORATS.
That’s larger than the expected move ahead of any Nvidia report over the
last three years and well above the stock’s average post-earnings move
of 8.1% over that same period, ORATS data showed.   </p>
<p>The results come at the end of an earnings season during which
investors have taken a less forgiving view of big tech companies whose
earnings failed to justify rich valuations or prodigious spending on AI.
Examples include Microsoft MSFT.O, Tesla TSLA.O and Alphabet GOOGL.O,
whose shares are all down since their July reports.  </p>
<p>Nvidia’s valuations have also climbed, as the stock soared about 750%
since the start of 2023, making it the world’s third-most valuable
company as of Thursday, while also drawing comparisons to the dotcom
bubble of more than two decades ago. The company’s shares trade at about
37 times forward 12-month earnings estimates, compared with a 20-year
average of 29 times, according to LSEG Datastream.  </p>
<p>Market sentiment could depend as much on Nvidia’s guidance as its
results. Evidence that it sees robust demand will be a bullish sign that
companies are continuing to invest rather than pull back in anticipation
of an economic slowdown, said Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager,
equities, at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management.  </p>
<p>Nvidia’s “connection to the largest companies in the U.S. stock
market makes this a must-watch event,” he said. “The biggest piece that
investors want to know is whether there is sustainability and what
demand will look like in ’25 and ’26,” he said.  </p>
<p>The trajectory of monetary policy and the U.S. economy also looms
large for investors. In a Friday morning speech in Jackson Hole,
Wyoming, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell offered an explicit
endorsement of interest rate cuts, saying further cooling in the job
market would be unwelcome.  </p>
<p>Investors will be watching U.S. labor market data on Sept. 6 for
evidence of whether last month’s unexpected downshift in employment
carried over to August. Signs that employment is continuing to weaken
could bring back the recession fears that rocked markets earlier this
month.  </p>
<p>A tight presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris, a
Democrat, and Republican former President Donald Trump may also whip up
market uncertainty in the weeks ahead.  </p>
<p>The August surge in stocks may make it difficult for markets to make
much more headway in the near term even if Nvidia’s earnings impress
Wall Street, said John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds,
which holds shares of the chipmaker.  </p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 trades at 21 times expected earnings, far above its
long-term average of 15.7.  </p>
<p>“The stock market as a whole is still trading at stretched valuations
so the bar remains high,” Belton said.</p>

Specifically, its a low-cost cruise missile startup, which the Financial
Times reports would be suitable for use in a potential war between the
US and China. The cruise missiles are 10x smaller and 10x cheaper than
today’s alternatives, but presumably still murder people.

<p>
“There is “a very interesting situation where geopolitical heat and the

pragmatic,” said the founder of one start-up that was in the same group
of YC-funded companies as Ares. […] “People support builders doing cool,

Very interesting indeed. Certainly, you can make money by selling
weapons of war. But should you? And in what world is killing people
“cool stuff”?

too much of a surprise. But for a while there, in the wake of the

different direction. It’s disappointing to see that this was ephemeral

Copilot falsely accuses court reporter of crimes he covered</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>German journalist Martin Bernklau typed his name and location into
Microsoft’s Copilot to see how his culture blog articles would be picked
up by the chatbot, according to German public broadcaster SWR. The
answers shocked Bernklau. Copilot falsely claimed Bernklau had been
charged with and convicted of child abuse and exploiting dependents. It
also claimed that he had been involved in a dramatic escape from a
psychiatric hospital and had exploited grieving women as an unethical
mortician. Copilot even went so far as to claim that it was
“unfortunate” that someone with such a criminal past had a family
and, according to SWR, provided Bernklau’s full address with phone
number and route planner. ↫ Matthias Bastian So why did Copilot (which
is just OpenAI’s ChatGPT with sparkles) claim Bernklau did all sorts of
horrible things? Well, his occupation – journalist – is a dead giveaway.
He has written a lot of articles covering court proceedings in Tübingen
on abuse, violence, and fraud cases, and since Copilot is just spicy
autocorrect, it has no understanding of context and pinned the various
crimes he covered on Bernklau. Adding in his address, phone number, and
a damn planned route to his home is just the very disgusting icing on
this already disgusting cake. What makes matters even worse, if you can
believe it, is that Bernklau has absolutely no recourse. He contacted
the public prosecutor’s office in Tübingen, but they stated they can’t
press charges because the accusations coming from Copilot aren’t being
made by a real person. And to make it still even worse, Microsoft just
threw its hands in the air and absolved itself of any and all
responsibility by pointing to its terms of service, in which Microsoft
discards liability for content generated by Copilot. Convenient. This is
nothing short of a nightmare scenario that can utterly destroy someone’s
life, and the fact that Microsoft doesn’t care and the law isn’t even
remotely prepared to take serious matters like these on is
terrifying.</p>

id="hurricane-hone-sweeps-past-hawaii-dumping-enough-rain-to-ease-wildfire-fears">Hurricane
Hone sweeps past Hawaii, dumping enough rain to ease wildfire fears</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HONOLULU — Hurricane Hone passed just south of Hawaii early Sunday,
dumping enough rain for the National Weather Service to call off its red
flag warnings that strong winds could cause wildfires on the drier sides
of islands in the archipelago.</p>
<p>Hone had top winds of 80 mph (130 kph), according to a 2 a.m.
advisory from the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu, and was
moving west near the southernmost point of the Big Island, close enough
to sweep the coast with tropical storm force winds and to drop up to a
foot (30 centimeters) or more of rain on the windward and
southeast-facing slopes of the Big Island, with locally higher amounts
possible. </p>
<p>Hurricane Gilma, meanwhile, increased to a Category 4 hurricane
Saturday night, but it was still about 1,480 miles (2,380 kilometers)
east of Hilo and forecast to weaken into a depression before it reaches
Hawaii.</p>
<p>“Hone’s main threats to the state continue to be the potential for
heavy rainfall leading to flooding, damaging winds and large surf along
east-facing shores,” the weather service advised early Sunday. </p>
<p>Some Big Island beach parks were closed due to dangerously high surf
and officials were preparing to open shelters if needed, Big Island
Mayor Mitch Roth said.</p>
<p>Hone, whose name is Hawaiian for “sweet and soft,” poked at memories
still fresh of last year’s deadly blazes on Maui, which were fueled by
hurricane-force winds. Red flag alerts are issued when warm
temperatures, very low humidity and stronger winds combine to raise fire
dangers. Most of the archipelago is already abnormally dry or in
drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.</p>
<p>“They gotta take this thing serious,” said Calvin Endo, a Waianae
Coast neighborhood board member who lives in Makaha, a leeward Oahu
neighborhood prone to wildfires.</p>
<p>The Aug. 8, 2023, blaze that torched the historic town of Lahaina was
the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century, with 102 dead. Dry,
overgrown grasses and drought helped spread the fire.</p>
<p>For years, Endo has worried about dry brush on private property
behind his home. He’s taken matters into his own hands by clearing the
brush himself, but he’s concerned about nearby homes abutting overgrown
vegetation.</p>
<p>“All you need is fire and wind and we’ll have another Lahaina,” Endo
said Saturday. “I notice the wind started to kick up already.”</p>
<p>The cause of the Lahaina blaze is still under investigation, but it’s
possible it was ignited by bare electrical wire and leaning power poles
toppled by the strong winds. The state’s two power companies, Hawaiian
Electric and the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative, were prepared to shut
off power if necessary to reduce the chance that live, damaged power
lines could start fires, but they later said the safety measures would
not be necessary as Hone blew past the islands. </p>
<p>Roth said a small blaze that started Friday night in Waikoloa, on the
dry side of the Big Island, was brought under control without injuries
or damage.</p>

rapper Macklemore cancels Dubai gig over alleged UAE role in Sudan
war</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Dubai, United Arab Emirates — U.S. rapper Macklemore has announced he
is cancelling an upcoming show in Dubai over the UAE’s involvement in
the conflict in Sudan, charges the Gulf state has denied.</p>
<p>The rapper best known for hits like 2012’s “Thrift Shop” made the
announcement in a post on social media on Saturday.</p>
<p>“I have decided to cancel my upcoming show in Dubai this October,” he
said.</p>
<p>“Over the last several months I’ve had a number of people reach out
to me, sharing resources and asking me to cancel the show in solidarity
with the people of Sudan,” he said.</p>
<p>“Until the UAE stops arming and funding the RSF I will not perform
there,” Macklemore added, referring to the paramilitary Rapid Support
Forces that have been battling the Sundanese army.</p>
<p>War has raged since April 2023 between the Sudanese army, under the
country’s de facto ruler Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the RSF, which is
commanded by Burhan’s former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.</p>
<p>For months, the army has accused the UAE of supporting the RSF.</p>
<p>In June, Sudan’s ambassador to the United Nations Al-Harith Idriss
al-Harith Mohamed called Abu Dhabi’s financial and military support for
the RSF the “main reason behind this protracted war.”</p>
<p>The UAE has denied allegations of RSF support as “disinformation,”
saying that it’s efforts are focused exclusively towards de-escalation
and alleviating Sudan’s humanitarian suffering.</p>
<p>Macklemore has released socially aware music in the past, supporting
LGBTQ+ rights while also criticizing ills including poverty and
consumerism.</p>
<p>In his latest track released in May, Macklemore voices support for
Palestinians and also praises students across the United States
protesting against Israel’s war in Gaza.</p>
<p>The song, “Hind’s Hall,” is named after a building at Columbia
University that students recently occupied and renamed after Hind Rajab,
a six-year-old Palestinian girl killed in Gaza.</p>

after floods, Vermont businesses struggling to get visitors to
return</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>burke, vermont — Two bouts of flooding from storms in July has
hampered businesses and destinations in an economically depressed
section of northern Vermont, with some still closed as they continue to
repair damage and others urging visitors, who were deterred by the
weather, to make the trip. </p>
<p>Kingdom Trails, a popular destination for mountain bikers, draws tens
of thousands of visitors a year. But the storms that hit the region on
July 10 and July 30 washed away some roads and bridges, damaged homes
and trails, and discouraged visitors at the height of the season. </p>
<p>Businesses and destinations are picking up the pieces, with some
still closed in nearby Lyndonville, while others want to get the word
out that they are very much open. </p>
<p>“I can’t stress enough that we are open and our community is
welcoming people,” said Abby Long, executive director of Kingdom Trails.
“We’re encouraging folks to not only come visit Kingdom Trails and have
an awesome time but sign up to volunteer mucking and gutting houses for
the morning and then relax on the trails in the afternoon.” </p>
<p>The storms caused $300,000 in damages to the trails — and that
doesn’t account for the loss of membership revenue, she said. The trails
were closed for about a day and a half as crews worked furiously to get
them back open. The cost of repairs comes on top of the $150,000 in
damages suffered in last summer’s flooding. </p>
<p>“That is not sustainable,” Long said. </p>
<p>So far, 341 businesses in Vermont have reported flood damage to the
state this year, according to Economic Development Commissioner Joan
Goldstein. Last summer, about 1,100 businesses were affected, she
said. </p>
<p>In Lyndonville, a popular diner that had been in business since 1978
will not be reopening after getting damaged in the July 10 storms. The
owner of the Miss Lyndonville Diner is having repairs done and plans to
sell the restaurant. She told the Caledonian Record that the flooding
convinced her it was time to retire. </p>
<p>Leaving ski industry</p>
<p>The nearby Village Sport Shop, which also has been in business for
nearly 50 years, has decided to close its flooded Lyndonville shop and
exit the ski industry, according to a social media post by the
business. </p>
<p>“With the multiple flooding events we have endured and the evolution
we have needed to take as a business, we have come to the decision it is
time to turn our focus towards the summer side of the business and
relieve ourselves from the flood risks the lowest lying real estate on
the strip endures,” the post said. The business has a trailside bicycle
shop in East Burke. </p>
<p>A bagel shop and a Walgreens drugstore were still temporarily closed
as they recover from the flood damage. </p>
<p>On Tuesday, President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration
making federal funding available to help individuals and communities
recover from the July 9-10 flooding from the remnants of Hurricane
Beryl. Governor Phil Scott has requested a separate disaster declaration
for the July 30 storms and flooding. </p>
<p>In May, Vermont became the first state to enact a law requiring
fossil fuel companies to pay a share of the damage caused by extreme
weather fanned by climate change. But officials have acknowledged that
collecting any money will depend on litigation against a
much-better-resourced oil industry. </p>
<p>In Burke, a town of about 1,650 that is home to the Burke Mountain
ski area, Kingdom Trails is a huge economic driver, said Town
Administrator Jim Sullivan. </p>
<p>“It’s traumatic, it’s unbelievable the extent that it ripples out,”
he said. “If Kingdom Trails can’t open, people cancel their reservations
at the Airbnbs and at the inns. We have restaurants that are counting on
all of those people coming here. And it’s just a chain event that
eventually dwindles where you have these absolutely beautiful days and
you just don’t have the people here that we normally would have if we
didn’t have this devastation.” </p>
<p>‘Screeching halt’</p>
<p>The East Burke Market was having a really good summer but when the
trails closed down, business “came to a bit of a screeching halt,” said
co-owner Burton Hinton. </p>
<p>Each of the storms caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in road
and property damage, Sullivan said. The town lost a bridge in the July
10 flooding and the whole mountain road in the storm weeks later, he
said. </p>
<p>“We’re still waiting for some direction from the federal government.
In the meantime, everybody has really come together and done a great job
of helping each other. True community,” he said. </p>
<p>About 60 student-athletes who race in cross-country mountain biking
with the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Cycling League, and 40 coaches,
were in Burke to train at Kingdom Trails when the latest flooding hit on
July 30. </p>
<p>The group had to pivot to ride on gravel for a few days but then some
trails reopened quickly, said Michael Morrell, with the National
Interscholastic Cycling Association, who was with them. </p>
<p>“The trail system up here and the trail crew are just so efficient,
and the trails, many of the trails, they drain very well,” he said on
August 1. </p>
<p>Still, he said he felt terrible for those reliant on getting tourists
to visit the local trails. </p>
<p>“I feel so bad that their roads are closed,” Morrell said. ” … We’re
just glad that we can help support them in any way we can.”</p>

<h2 id="us-crossword-fan-creates-puzzles-celebrating-black-heritage">US
crossword fan creates puzzles celebrating Black heritage</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — It started a couple of years ago when Juliana Pache was
doing a crossword puzzle and got stuck.</p>
<p>She was unfamiliar with the reference that the clue made. It made her
think about what a crossword puzzle would look like if the clues and
answers included more of some subjects that she was familiar with,
thanks to her own identity and interests — Black history and Black
popular culture.</p>
<p>When she couldn’t find such a thing, Pache decided to do it herself.
In January 2023, she created blackcrossword.com, a site that offers a
free mini-crossword puzzle every day. And Tuesday marked the release of
her first book, Black Crossword: 100 Mini Puzzles Celebrating the
African Diaspora.</p>
<p>It’s a good moment for it, nearly 111 years after the first crossword
appeared in a New York newspaper. Recent years have seen an increasing
amount of conversation around representation in crossword puzzles, from
who’s constructing them to what words can be used for answers and how
the clues are framed. There’s been a push to expand the idea of the
kinds of “common knowledge” players would have to fill them out.</p>
<p>“I had never made a crossword puzzle before,” Pache, 32, said with a
laugh. “But I was like, ‘I can figure it out.’”</p>
<p>And she did.</p>
<p>Made ‘with Black people in mind’</p>
<p>Each puzzle on Pache’s site includes at least a few clues and answers
connecting to Black culture. The tagline on the site: “If you know, you
know.”</p>
<p>The book is brimming with the kinds of puzzles that she estimates
about 2,200 people play daily on her site — squares made up of five
lines, each with five spaces. She aims for at least three of the clues
to be references to aspects of Black cultures from around the world.</p>
<p>Pache, a native of the New York City borough of Queens with family
ties to Cuba and the Dominican Republic, had a couple of goals in mind
when she started. Primarily, she wanted to create something that Black
people would enjoy.</p>
<p>“I’m making it with Black people in mind,” she said. “And then if
anyone else enjoys it, they learn things from it, that’s a bonus but
it’s not my focus.”</p>
<p>She’s also trying to show the diversity in Black communities and
cultures with the clues and words she uses, and to encourage people from
different parts of the African diaspora to learn about each other.</p>
<p>“I also want to make it challenging, not just for people who might be
interested in Black culture, but people within Black culture who might
be interested in other regions,” she said. “Part of my mission with this
is to highlight Black people from all over, Black culture from all over.
And I think … that keeps us learning about each other.”</p>
<p>What, really, is ‘general knowledge’?</p>
<p>While on the surface if might just seem like a game, the knowledge
base required for crosswords does say something about what kind of
knowledge is considered “general” and “universal” and what isn’t, said
Michelle Pera-McGhee, a data journalist at The Pudding, a site that
focuses on data-driven stories.</p>
<p>In 2020, Pera-McGhee undertook a data project analyzing crossword
puzzles through the decades from a handful of the most well-known media
outlets. The project assessed clues and answers that used the names of
real people to determine a breakdown along gender and race
categories.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the data indicated that for the most part, men were
disproportionately more likely than women to be featured, as well as
white people compared to racial and ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>It’s “interesting because it’s supposed to be easy,” Pera-McGhee
said. “You want … ideally to reference things that people, everybody
knows about because everyone learns about them in school or whatever. …
What are the things that we decide we all should know?”</p>
<p>There are efforts to make crosswords more accessible and
representative, including the recently started fellowship for puzzle
constructors from underrepresented groups at The New York Times, among
the most high-profile crossword puzzles around. Puzzle creators have
made puzzles aimed at LGBTQ+ communities, at women, using a wider array
of references as Pache is doing.</p>
<p>Bottom line, “it is really cool to see our culture reflected in this
medium,” Pache said.</p>
<p>And, Pera-McGhee said, it can be cool to learn new things.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of enriching to have things in the puzzle that you don’t
know about,” she said. “It’s not that the experience of not knowing is
bad. It’s just that it should maybe be spread out along with the
experience of knowing. Both are kind of good in the crossword-solving
experience.”</p>

weather leads to summer snowfall in western mountains of US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, California — An unusually cold weather system
from the Gulf of Alaska interrupted summer along the West Coast of the
United States on Saturday, bringing snow to Washington state’s Mount
Rainier and a lookout point of California’s Sierra Nevada.</p>
<p>Photos posted by the National Weather Service and local authorities
showed a white-covered peak from Rainier and a dusting of snow at
Minaret Vista, a lookout point southeast of Yosemite National Park in
California’s Sierra Nevada.</p>
<p>Madera County Deputy Sheriff Larry Rich said it was “definitely
unexpected” to see snow at Minaret Vista in August.</p>
<p>“It’s not every day you get to spend your birthday surrounded by a
winter wonderland in the middle of summer,” he said in a statement. “It
made for a day I won’t soon forget, and a unique reminder of why I love
serving in this area. It’s just one of those moments that makes working
up here so special.”</p>
<p>Snow also fell overnight on Mammoth Mountain, a ski destination in
California, with the National Weather Service warning hikers and campers
to prepare for slick roads.</p>
<p>More light snow was possible in California on the crest of the Sierra
Nevada, mostly around Tioga Pass and higher elevations of Yosemite
National Park, the National Weather Service said.</p>
<p>August snow has not occurred in those locations since 2003,
forecasters said.</p>
<p>Tioga Pass rises to more than 9,900 feet (3,017 meters) and serves as
the eastern entryway to Yosemite. But it is usually closed much of each
year by winter snow that can take one or two months to clear.</p>
<p>“While this snow will not stay around very long, roads near Tioga
Pass could be slick and any campers and hikers should prepare for winter
conditions,” the weather service wrote.</p>
<p>While the start of ski season is at least several months away, the
hint of winter was welcomed by resorts.</p>
<p>“It’s a cool and blustery August day here at Palisades Tahoe, as a
storm that could bring our first snowfall of the season moves in this
afternoon!” the resort said in a social media post Friday.</p>
<p>The “anomalous cool conditions” will spread over much of the western
U.S. by Sunday morning, according to the National Weather Service’s
Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.</p>
<p>Despite the expected precipitation, forecasters also warned of fire
danger because of gusty winds associated with the passage of the cold
front.</p>
<p>At the same time, a flash flood watch was issued for the burn scar of
California’s largest wildfire so far this year from Friday morning
through Saturday morning.</p>
<p>The Park Fire roared across more than 671 square miles (1,748 square
kilometers) after it erupted in late July near the Central Valley city
of Chico and climbed up the western slope of the Sierra.</p>
<p>The fire became California’s fourth largest on record, but it has
been substantially tamed recently. Islands of vegetation continue to
burn within its existing perimeter, but evacuation orders have been
canceled.</p>
<p>California’s wildfire season got off to an intense start amid extreme
July heat. Blazes fed on dried-out vegetation that grew during
back-to-back wet years. Fire activity has recently fallen into a
relative lull.</p>
<p>Forecasts call for a rapid return of summer heat as the cold front
departs.</p>

id="on-taiwan-visit-haley-says-isolationist-policy-for-us-not-healthy">On
Taiwan visit, Haley says isolationist policy for US not ‘healthy’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TAIPEI, Taiwan — Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki
Haley said on a visit to Taiwan Saturday that an isolationist policy
isn’t “healthy” and called on the Republican Party to stand with her
country’s allies, while still putting in good words for the party’s
nominee, Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Haley, who ran against Trump for the Republican presidential
nomination, told reporters in the capital, Taipei, that supporting U.S.
allies, including Ukraine and Israel, is vital. She underscored the
importance of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory, to be
brought under control by force if necessary.</p>
<p>“I don’t think the isolationist approach is healthy. I think America
can never sit in a bubble and think that we won’t be affected,” she
said.</p>
<p>While the U.S. doesn’t formally recognize Taiwan, it is the island’s
strongest backer and main arms provider. However, Trump’s attempt to
reclaim the presidency has fueled worries. He said Taiwan should pay for
U.S. protection in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek published in
July and dodged answering the question of whether he would defend the
island against a possible Chinese military action.</p>
<p>When Haley shuttered her own bid for the Republican nomination, she
did not immediately endorse Trump, having accused him of causing chaos
and disregarding the importance of U.S. alliances abroad. But in May she
said she would be voting for him, while making it clear that she felt
her former boss had work to do to win over voters who supported her.</p>
<p>On Saturday, she spoke in Trump’s favor. She said that having
previously served with Trump’s administration, “we did show American
strength in the world,” pointing to their pushback against China and
their sanctioning of Russia and North Korea, among other efforts.</p>
<p>“I think that all of that strength that we showed is the reason that
we didn’t see any wars, we didn’t see any invasions, we didn’t see any
harm that happened during that time. I think Donald Trump would bring
that back,” she said.</p>
<p>Trump has claimed that if elected, he would end the conflict in
Ukraine before Inauguration Day in January. But Russia’s United Nations
ambassador said he can’t. Trump’s public comments have varied between
criticizing U.S. backing for Ukraine’s defense and supporting it, while
his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, has been a leader of Republican efforts
to block what have been billions in U.S. military and financial
assistance to Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022.</p>
<p>Concerns among Ukraine and its supporters that the country could lose
vital U.S. support have increased as Trump’s campaign surged.</p>
<p>Haley criticized Trump’s rival, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris,
saying she would “do exactly” what President Joe Biden had done. She
said Harris was part of his administration when the Taliban took over
Afghanistan in 2021, when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and when the
Hamas-Israel war broke out last year.</p>
<p>“She was in the situation room right next to Joe Biden. She was there
making the exact same decisions. Those decisions have made the world
less safe,” she said.</p>
<p>Haley added that while the Republicans and Democrats may not
currently concur on much, they agree on “the threats of China,” adding
that Taiwan is now looking “to make sure that if China starts a fight
with them, that they are prepared to make sure that they can fight
back.”</p>
<p>She said her party should stand with the country’s allies and make
sure that U.S. shows strength around the world. She also said any
authoritarian regime and “communists” harming or hurting other free
countries should be a personal matter to the U.S.</p>
<p>“We don’t want to see communist China win. We don’t want to see
Russia win. We don’t want to see Iran or North Korea win,” she said.</p>
<p>Haley met Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te during this week’s trip.
She called for more international backing for the self-ruled island, a
coordinated pushback against China’s claims over it, and for Taiwan to
become a full member of the United Nations.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said Saturday that 38 warplanes and 12
vessels from China were detected around the island during a 24-hour
period from Friday morning. Thirty-two of the planes crossed the middle
of the line of the Taiwan Strait, an unofficial boundary that’s
considered a buffer between the island and mainland.</p>

<h2 id="adding-16-kb-page-size-to-android">Adding 16 KB page size to
Android</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>A page is the granularity at which an operating system manages
memory. Most CPUs today support a 4 KB page size and so the Android OS
and applications have historically been built and optimized to run with
a 4 KB page size. ARM CPUs support the larger 16 KB page size. When
Android uses this larger page size, we observe an overall performance
boost of 5-10% while using ~9% additional memory. In order to improve
the operating system performance overall and to give device
manufacturers an option to make this trade-off, Android 15 can run with
4 KB or 16 KB page sizes. ↫ Steven Moreland Android 15 has been reworked
to be page-size agnostic, meaning that a single binary can run on either
4 KB or 16 KB versions of Android. Any assumptions about page size have
been removed from Android as well, the EROFS and F2FS file systems as
well as UFS are now compatible with 16 KB, and a whole lot more things
have been changed and refactored to make this transition as effortless
as possible. Application developers do need to do a few things, though.
They’ll need to recompile their binaries with 16 KB alignment, after
which they’ll need to be tested in a 16 KB version of an Android device
or emulator. To make this possible, starting with Android 15 QPR1, the
Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro will get a new develop option that will reboot
the device in 16 KB mode. In addition, Android Studio will gain a 16 KB
emulator target as well. The 16 KB page size is an ARM-only feature, so
people running the emulator on x86 devices will emulate the 16 KB page
size, in which “the Kernel runs in 4 KB mode, but all addresses exposed
to applications are aligned to 16 KB”. Of course, Google urges Android
developers to test for 16 KB page sizes as soon as possible.</p>

id="nasa-decides-to-keep-2-stranded-astronauts-in-space-until-february">NASA
decides to keep 2 stranded astronauts in space until February</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — NASA decided Saturday it’s too risky to
bring two astronauts back to Earth in Boeing’s troubled new capsule, and
they’ll have to wait until next year for a ride home with SpaceX. What
should have been a weeklong test flight for the pair will now last more
than eight months.</p>
<p>The seasoned pilots have been stuck at the International Space
Station since the beginning of June. A cascade of vexing thruster
failures and helium leaks in the new capsule marred their trip to the
space station, and they ended up in a holding pattern as engineers
conducted tests and debated what to do about the trip back.</p>
<p>After almost three months, the decision finally came down from NASA’s
highest ranks on Saturday. Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will come
back in a SpaceX spacecraft in February. Their empty Starliner capsule
will undock in a week or two and attempt to return on autopilot.</p>
<p>As Starliner’s test pilots, the pair should have overseen this
critical last leg of the journey, with touchdown in the U.S. desert.</p>
<p>It was a blow to Boeing, adding to the safety concerns plaguing the
company on its airplane side. Boeing had counted on Starliner’s first
crew trip to revive the troubled program after years of delays and
ballooning costs. The company had insisted Starliner was safe based on
all the recent thruster tests in space and on the ground.</p>
<p>The astronauts</p>
<p>Retired Navy captains with previous long-duration spaceflight
experience, Wilmore, 61, and Williams, 58, anticipated surprises when
they accepted the shakedown cruise of a new spacecraft, although not
quite to this extent.</p>
<p>Before their June 5 launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, they said
their families bought into the uncertainty and stress of their
professional careers decades ago. During their lone orbital news
conference last month, they said they had trust in the thruster testing
being conducted. They had no complaints, they added, and enjoyed
pitching in with space station work.</p>
<p>Wilmore’s wife, Deanna, was equally stoic in an interview earlier
this month with WVLT-TV in Knoxville, Tennessee, their home state. She
was already bracing for a delay until next February: “You just sort of
have to roll with it.”</p>
<p>There were few options.</p>
<p>The SpaceX capsule currently parked at the space station is reserved
for the four residents who have been there since March. They will return
in late September, their stay extended a month by the Starliner dilemma.
NASA said it would be unsafe to squeeze two more into the capsule,
except in an emergency.</p>
<p>The docked Russian Soyuz capsule is even tighter, capable of flying
only three — two of them Russians wrapping up a yearlong stint.</p>
<p>So, Wilmore and Williams will wait for SpaceX’s next taxi flight.
It’s due to launch in late September with two astronauts instead of the
usual four for a routine six-month stay. NASA yanked two to make room
for Wilmore and Williams on the return flight in late February.</p>
<p>NASA said no serious consideration was given to asking SpaceX for a
quick stand-alone rescue. Last year, the Russian Space Agency had to
rush up a replacement Soyuz capsule for three men whose original craft
was damaged by space junk. The switch pushed their mission beyond a
year, a U.S. space endurance record still held by Frank Rubio.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>History of problems</p>
<p>Starliner’s woes began long before its latest flight.</p>
<p>Bad software fouled the first test flight without a crew in 2019,
prompting a do-over in 2022. Then parachute and other issues cropped up,
including a helium leak in the capsule’s propellant system that nixed a
launch attempt in May. The leak was deemed isolated and small enough to
pose no concern. But more leaks sprouted following liftoff, and five
thrusters also failed.</p>
<p>All but one of those small thrusters restarted in flight. But
engineers remain perplexed as to why some thruster seals appear to
swell, obstructing the propellant lines, then revert to their normal
size.</p>
<p>These 28 thrusters are vital. Besides being needed for space station
rendezvous, they keep the capsule pointed in the right direction at
flight’s end as bigger engines steer the craft out of orbit. Coming in
crooked could result in catastrophe.</p>
<p>With the Columbia disaster still fresh in many minds — the shuttle
broke apart during reentry in 2003, killing all seven aboard — NASA
embraced open debate over Starliner’s return capability. Dissenting
views were stifled during Columbia’s doomed flight, just as they were
during Challenger’s in 1986.</p>
<p>Despite Saturday’s decision, NASA isn’t giving up on Boeing.</p>
<p>NASA went into its commercial crew program a decade ago wanting two
competing U.S. companies ferrying astronauts in the post-shuttle era.
Boeing won the bigger contract: more than $4 billion, compared with
SpaceX’s $2.6 billion.</p>
<p>With station supply runs already under its belt, SpaceX aced its
first of now nine astronaut flights in 2020, while Boeing got bogged
down in design flaws that set the company back more than $1 billion.
NASA officials still hold out hope that Starliner’s problems can be
corrected in time for another crew flight in another year or so.</p>

<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>
I love hanging out in <a href="https://reeder.app">Reeder</a>. I
subscribe to thousands of feeds, and it handles them well for me. But it
does make it hard for me to prune them once I’m subscribed.
</p>
<p>
I found myself looking at this screen this afternoon:

<p>
And I thought to myself: you know what? I don’t need to be subscribed to
Axios. This isn’t the kind of article I’m looking to consume on a
regular basis.
</p>
<p>
So, uh, how do I unsubscribe from it?
</p>
<p>
There’s nothing here that allows me to unsubscribe from the feed while
I’m looking at this post. There’s <em>also</em> nothing that tells me
which folder it’s in, so I can go looking for the feed and unsubscribe
it there. I’m actually not really sure where I filed it. And I can’t
search for feeds by name. Sure, I could have a better, more organized
system, but really, I could use more help.
</p>
<p>
This contextual menu also doesn’t help me:

So until I go through my subscriptions folder by folder, I’m stuck
reading pieces about the Harris campaign mocking Trump, which, to be
honest, I really don’t care about.

<p>
Regardless, it’s my favorite feed reader. But I come up against this
issue surprisingly regularly.

<h2 id="thoughts-on-symbols">Thoughts on symbols</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-24, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Yesterday &lt;a href=&quot;https://symbol.fediverse.info/&quot;&gt;this proposal for a new symbol&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse&quot;&gt;fediverse&lt;/a&gt; was making the rounds. People made comments on it. People always make comments. We all do. Some liked it, some thought it reminds a bunch of snowflakes (it kinda does), others think it’s not bad but the old one is better. Every time someone “rebrands” something this type of reaction is pretty common. My first thought when I saw it was “Does the fediverse need a symbol?”.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
In their proposal, the first thing they explain is how this is a
typographical character that can be copy pasted everywhere. Cool, I
guess. The second is the original meaning of the symbol:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It refers to groups of stars in the sky, akin to constellations.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Then they explain why they think it’s a good symbol:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We suggest that it’s a very fitting symbol for the fediverse, a galaxy
of interconnected spaces which is decentralised and has an
astronomically-themed name. It represents several stars coming together,
connecting but each their own, without a centre.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’m no astrophysicist, and if what I’m saying is wrong I’m sure
<a href="https://briankoberlein.com/">Brian</a> will correct me, but I’m
pretty sure galaxies do have a centre. And also, the last thing you want
is to have “several stars coming together” because that’s gonna end
badly.
</p>
<p>
Also, and probably quite fittingly, stars in the sky only give us here
on earth the illusion of being in some way connected while in reality
there’s no connection and are all incredibly far apart. But hey, maybe
that was an intentional secret meaning behind this starry-themed symbol
they picked. But I digress.
</p>
<p>
After describing the meaning they then explain what the fediverse is and
only then they address the most important question which is why do you
need a symbol in the first place.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Thanks to the interconnected nature of the fediverse, it usually doesn’t
matter if someone is a member of one platform or another. What matters
is that they can follow each other as part of the fediverse. A single
symbol to represent that belonging can often be more relevant than
individual icons for each service.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This, to me, means absolutely nothing. But also, I think trying to unify
people behind a silly symbol is the wrong move. And it’s also a
misguided effort. A new symbol doesn’t solve anything and doesn’t help
your cause. Also, <em>“A single symbol to represent that belonging can
often be more relevant than individual icons for each service”</em>
belonging to what? I am no fediverse citizen but I do consider myself a
good citizen of the web. I try my best to make it a better place and I
try to encourage people to own their corners of the web. Am I excluded
from your fancy club because I don’t “federate”? Are you saying I don’t
belong? I’m asking this rhetorically, because frankly speaking, I
couldn’t give less of a fuck about belonging to some arbitrary
definition.
</p>
<p>
Stop trying to make everything about symbols and flags and tribes. It’s
not helping.

id="feds-actions-spoke-louder-than-words-in-inflation-fight-research-shows">Fed’s
actions spoke louder than words in inflation fight, research shows</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>JACKSON HOLE, Wyoming — The Federal Reserve’s credibility in the eyes
of financial markets helped in its battle against inflation over the
past two years, but it had to be earned afresh with interest rate hikes
that backed up policymakers’ verbal promises to restore price stability,
according to new research presented at the Kansas City Fed’s annual
research conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.</p>
<p>A strong perception in financial markets that a central bank is
committed to inflation control can make monetary policy more effective,
prompting markets to shift financial conditions faster and lowering
inflation with a less-serious hit to economic growth than would
otherwise be the case.</p>
<p>While investors came to believe that the U.S. central bank under the
leadership of Fed Chair Jerome Powell was serious about defending its 2%
inflation target, that belief only formed over time and after the
officials began raising the policy interest rate in March 2022 and
accelerated the rate hikes over that summer, the researchers found.</p>
<p>“Forecasters and markets were highly uncertain about the monetary
policy rule prior to ‘liftoff’ and learned about it from the Fed’s rate
hikes,” economists Michael Bauer from the San Francisco Fed, Carolin
Pflueger from the University of Chicago, and Adi Sunderam from the
Harvard Business School, found in their research. “Substantial rate
hikes were apparently necessary for perceptions to shift. … The public
did not fully understand the Fed’s strategy and policy rule prior to
liftoff.”</p>
<p>The research serves as a warning of sorts against central bankers
putting too much weight on the power of “talk therapy” — or the ability
to influence economic outcomes with words and promises alone.</p>
<p>Earning public trust</p>
<p>The Fed in recent years has been characterized by a surfeit of
speeches and public comments by its officials, whether by the head of
the central bank, other members of its presidentially appointed Board of
Governors, or its 12 regional bank presidents, under the notion that
more transparency is good for public accountability and makes policy
more effective.</p>
<p>Fed officials in the recent inflation battle often noted that public
belief in their commitment to the inflation target would help on its own
to lower the pace of price increases, shorten the time it took for
tighter monetary policy to have an impact, and lower inflation with less
damage to the job market and other aspects of the “real” economy.</p>
<p>The researchers found, however, that while the Fed under Powell
eventually earned the benefit of public trust, it also wasn’t a
given.</p>
<p>The research used survey data to quantify how professional
forecasters perceived the Fed would respond to higher inflation and
found that even as prices began rising in 2021 the expected Fed response
to inflation was near zero.</p>
<p>While that could have been attributed to several factors, including a
belief that inflation would ease on its own, the researchers concluded
it was because forecasters weren’t sure how the central bank would
react.</p>
<p>After the first rate increase in March of 2022, however, perceptions
began to shift, with forecasters eventually expecting the Fed to respond
on an almost one-for-one basis to any rise in inflation.</p>
<p>The change in perceptions coincided with policymakers shifting from
the initial quarter-percentage-point move to the first of four
75-basis-point hikes in June 2022, and with a stern speech by Powell at
that year’s Jackson Hole conference that reaffirmed his intent to defend
the inflation target despite the economic pain it might cause.</p>
<p>As market perceptions about the Fed’s sensitivity to inflation
increased, “interest rates became significantly more sensitive to
inflation data surprises,” the research found, adding that “the increase
in the perceived inflation response likely aided the transmission of
monetary policy to the real economy and improved the Fed’s
inflation-unemployment tradeoff.”</p>
<p>For future policymakers, the researchers said, the conclusion is
clear: Actions speak louder than words.</p>
<p>“Policy rate actions contribute to, and may even be necessary for,
the effectiveness of communication, particularly when uncertainty about
the monetary policy framework is high,” they found, suggesting the Fed’s
quarterly Summary of Economic Projections could be changed to make the
central bank’s “reaction function” more explicit. “A timely policy rate
response to inflation matters not only for influencing immediate
financial conditions, but also for signaling that policymakers are
serious.”</p>

<p>
This <a href="https://symbol.fediverse.info/">proposed image for the
fediverse</a> is good; I like it a lot.
</p>
<p>
But I don’t know that the combative language on this site is helpful.
The Meta iconography isn’t right, I agree, but there’s something off
about calling them “a large corporation that is joining in as late”
(sic).
</p>
<p>
For one thing, Meta is early; for another, it seems to me that we want
companies to participate? I don’t think seeking ideological purity is
useful (and run the risks of the movement shooting itself in the foot).
</p>
<p>
Whatever you think about Meta’s goals for participating, I do also think
Meta’s presence gives the network a sort of legitimacy that it was
otherwise struggling to achieve. That’s a net benefit: we must grow the
network.
</p>
<p>
I also agree with
<a href="https://www.manton.org/2024/08/24/i-like-the.html">the

<h2 id="babe-ruths-called-shot-jersey-could-auction-for-up-to-30m">Babe
Ruth’s ‘called shot’ jersey could auction for up to $30M</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DALLAS, Texas — Nearly a century after Babe Ruth called his shot
during the 1932 World Series, the jersey worn by the New York Yankees
slugger when he hit the home run to center field could sell at auction
for as much as $30 million.</p>
<p>Heritage Auctions is offering up the jersey Saturday night in
Dallas.</p>
<p>Ruth’s famed, debated and often imitated “called shot” came as the
Yankees and Chicago Cubs faced off in Game 3 of the World Series at
Chicago’s Wrigley Field on October 1, 1932. In the fifth inning, Ruth
made a pointing gesture while at bat and then hit a home run off Cubs
pitcher Charlie Root.</p>
<p>The Yankees won the game 7-5 and swept the Cubs the next day to win
the series.</p>
<p>That was Ruth’s last World Series, and the “called shot” was his last
home run in a World Series, said Mike Provenzale, the production manager
for Heritage’s sports department.</p>
<p>“When you can tie an item like that to an important figure and their
most important moment, that’s what collectors are really looking for,”
Provenzale said.</p>
<p>Heritage said Ruth gave the road jersey to one of his golfing buddies
in Florida around 1940 and it remained in that family for decades. Then,
in the early 1990s, that man’s daughter sold it to a collector. It was
then sold at auction in 2005 for $940,000, and that buyer consigned it
to Heritage this year.</p>
<p>In 2019, one of Ruth’s road jerseys dating to 1928-30 sold for $5.64
million in an auction conducted at Yankee Stadium. That jersey was part
of a collection of items that Ruth’s family had put up for sale.</p>

Bubble about to Burst?</h2>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I had a knee-jerk initial reaction to this post - <em>what</em> open
source bubble?! - but Tara Tarakiyee makes some important points here
about our dependence on open source code and how that might change over
time.
</p>
<p>
The through line to all of them is about money.
<a href="https://opensource.org/blog/community-input-drives-the-new-draft-of-the-open-source-ai-definition">The
OSI’s new “open source AI” definition</a> is loose because AI vendors
likely couldn’t make money otherwise (although whether they can make
money <em>anyway</em> is still up for debate); source-available licenses
have become prevalent because it’s easier to sell commercial licenses
and therefore make a living building software; much open source software
was precariously funded through European Commission Next Generation
Internet grants,
<a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/Criticism-programmed-EU-cuts-funding-for-free-software-and-the-open-web-9841882.html">which
are now evaporating</a>.
</p>
<p>
While we can stand for pure open source values all we like, the people
who build open source software need to make a living: food must go on
the table and they need a roof over their heads. Ideally their
compensation would extend beyond those basic necessities.
</p>
<p>
This has been the perennial problem for open source: how can it be
sustainable for the people who build it? We’re not launching into a
post-monetary Star Trek future any time soon. In the meantime, people
need to be paid for their work, or open source runs the risk of being a
hobbyist-only endeavor.
</p>
<p>
People won’t pay for software that they don’t need to pay for. I suspect
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model">open-core, which
opens the core of a software platform while monetizing high-value
extensions</a>, is the best answer we can hope for. But even that might
not be realistic.

Andy Jassy on using Amazon Q, the company’s generative AI assistant for
software development, internally:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“The average time to upgrade an application to Java 17 plummeted from
what’s typically 50 developer-days to just a few hours. We estimate this
has saved us the equivalent of 4,500 developer-years of work (yes, that
number is crazy but, real).”
</p>
<p>
“The benefits go beyond how much effort we’ve saved developers. The
upgrades have enhanced security and reduced infrastructure costs,
providing an estimated $260M in annualized efficiency gains.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Of course, Amazon is enormous, and any smaller business will need to
scale down those numbers and account for efficiencies that may have
occurred between engineers there.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, these are incredible figures. The savings are obviously
real, allowing engineers to focus on actual work rather than the
drudgery of upgrading Java (which is something that absolutely nobody
wants to spend their time doing).
</p>
<p>
We’ll see more of this - and we’ll begin to see more services which
allow for these efficiency gains between engineers across smaller
companies, startups, non-profits, and so on. The dumb companies will use
this as an excuse for reductions in force; the smart ones will use it as
an opportunity to accelerate their team’s productivity and build stuff
that really matters.

id="canadian-rail-arbitration-hearing-ends-without-decision-strike-looms">Canadian
rail arbitration hearing ends without decision; strike looms</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TORONTO — A workers’ union Friday threatened a strike at one of
Canada’s two major freight railroads, only hours after the company’s
trains restarted following a potentially devastating stoppage. A
government-ordered arbitration hearing wrapped up without a decision,
and Canadian National trains were expected to keep moving at least
through Monday morning.</p>
<p>CN and Canadian Pacific Kansas City Ltd. locked out their workers
Thursday when negotiations over a new labor contract reached a deadline
without an agreement. That resulted in a near total shutdown of freight
rail in the country for more than a day, until Canadian National resumed
its service Friday morning. Trains operated by CPKC remain parked, and
its workers, who had already been on strike since Thursday, stayed on
the picket line Friday.</p>
<p>The government forced the companies and the union, Teamsters Canada
Rail Conference, into arbitration overseen by the Canada Industrial
Relations Board — an order the union is challenging. Friday’s nine-hour
hearing ended with no order from the board.</p>
<p>The union filed a 72-hour strike notice against CN on Friday morning
shortly after it announced that it planned to challenge the arbitration
order, union spokesperson Marc-Andre Gauthier said.</p>
<p>If the board orders the union back to work, “the TCRC will lawfully
abide by the decision, but will undertake steps to challenge to the
fullest extent,” the Teamsters said in a statement. “Unfortunately, this
will not provide immediate relief, but the Union is prepared to appeal
to federal court if necessary.”</p>
<p>Canadian National, which has about 6,500 workers involved in the
dispute, said the impact of the strike notice will depend on the timing
of the Canada Industrial Relations Board’s decision. “It is in the
national interest of Canada that the CIRB rule quickly, before even more
harm is caused,” the railroad said in a written statement. CPKC has
about 3,000 engineers, conductors and dispatchers involved.</p>
<p>Perrin Beatty, president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce,
said the union’s latest actions “will prolong the damage to our economy
and jeopardize the wellbeing and livelihoods of Canadians, including
union and nonunion workers across multiple industries.”</p>
<p>Labor Minister Steven MacKinnon announced the decision to force the
parties into binding arbitration Thursday afternoon, more than 16 hours
after the lockout shut down the railroads, saying the economic risk was
too great to allow them to continue. The government had declined to
order arbitration two weeks ago. MacKinnon said he had hoped that
negotiations between the companies and the union on a new contract would
succeed.</p>
<p>“This is not about disobeying the minister’s order. It’s about
exercising our right,” Teamsters Canada President Francois Laporte said
Friday in announcing the strike. “We will exercise our right within the
legal framework.”</p>
<p>Canadian National trains had begun rolling at 7 a.m. across Canada,
said CN spokesperson Jonathan Abecassis. The development initially
appeared to at least partially end a work stoppage that threatened to
wreak havoc on the economies of Canada and the United States. Both
countries, across all industries, rely on railroads to deliver their raw
materials and finished products.</p>
<p>“While CN is focused on its recovery plan and powering the economy,
Teamsters are focused on getting back to the picket line and holding the
North American economy hostage to their demands,” Abecassis said
following the union’s strike notice.</p>
<p>Getting even one of the railroads running again is a relief for
businesses. In most past rail labor disputes, only one of the Canadian
railroads stopped and the economy was able to weather that
disruption.</p>
<p>The negotiations that began last year are hung up on issues around
the way workers are scheduled and contract rules designed to prevent
fatigue. The railroads had proposed shifting away from the current
system that pays workers based on the number of miles they travel, to a
system based on the hours they work. The railroads said the switch would
make it easier to provide predictable schedules. But the union resisted
because it feared the proposed changes would erode hard-fought
protections against fatigue and jeopardize safety.</p>
<p>In Canada, another issue at CN is the railroad’s intention to expand
a system that allows it to temporarily relocate workers to other parts
of its network when it’s short on employees in a certain region.</p>
<p>Regarding wages, the railroads said they both offered raises in line
with other recent deals in the industry for what are already well-paying
jobs. Canadian National has said its engineers make about $150,000 and
conductors earn roughly $121,000 for working 160 days a year, although
some of their time off is spent stuck at hotels on the road between
train trips while getting required rest. CPKC says its pay is
comparable.</p>
<p>Nearly all of Canada’s freight handled by rail — worth more than $730
million a day and adding up to more than 375 million tons of freight
last year — stopped Thursday along with rail shipments crossing the U.S.
border.</p>
<p>About 30,000 commuters in Canada were also affected because their
trains use CPKC’s lines. CPKC and CN’s trains continued operating in the
U.S. and Mexico during the lockout.</p>
<p>Billions of dollars of goods move between Canada and the U.S. via
rail each month, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of goods and services shipped across borders,” Sean
O’Brien, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said
at a rally in Calgary, Alberta, on Friday. “If this company chooses to
continue its bad behavior, then it is going to have an impact. … They’ve
got a lot of decisions they need to make. And they need to make the most
important decision: Reward these workers with what they’ve earned and
don’t try to diminish safety just so they need to feed their bottom
lines.”</p>

id="hone-approaches-hawaii-big-island-under-tropical-storm-warning">Hone
approaches Hawaii; Big Island under tropical storm warning</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HONOLULU, HAWAII — Tropical Storm Hone was approaching the southern
edges of Hawaii on Saturday with gusts of wind and heavy rain,
potentially inflicting flooding and wind damage on the Big Island over
the weekend and raising the risk of wildfires on the drier sides of the
islands.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service has issued a tropical storm warning for
Hawaii County, which includes all of the Big Island, and a red flag
warning for the leeward sides of all islands.</p>
<p>Hone, which means “sweet and soft” in Hawaiian, had top winds of 105
kilometers per hour (65 miles per hour) early Saturday. It will likely
strengthen into a Category 1 hurricane as it passes near or south of the
Big Island from Saturday night into early Sunday, according to the
National Hurricane Center in Miami.</p>
<p>The Hawaii Tourism Authority told travelers it’s still safe to come
to the islands but recommended that people postpone outdoor
activities.</p>
<p>“We are not advising visitors to cancel their trips,” the agency said
in a news release.</p>
<p>Hone was centered 465 kilometers (290 miles) east-southeast of Hilo
and 805 kilometers (500 miles) east-southeast of Honolulu early
Saturday.</p>
<p>The eastern and southeastern parts of the Big Island could get 11 to
25 centimeters (5 to 10 inches) of rain. The island could get sustained
winds of 32 to 64 kph (20 to 40 mph) and gusts near 97 kph (60 mph).</p>
<p>The dry air north of the storm will spread arid conditions across the
archipelago on Saturday, combining with strong winds to raise wildfire
risks. Most of the state is already abnormally dry or in drought,
according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.</p>
<p>The weather service’s red flag warning will be in effect from 10 a.m.
to 6 p.m. Saturday. It issues the alert when warm temperatures, very low
humidity and stronger winds combine to raise fire dangers. Winds are
expected to be strongest where they blow downslope from higher terrain,
over headlands and through passes, the hurricane center advised.</p>
<p>The situation recalls last year’s deadly wildfires on Maui, which
were fueled by hurricane-force winds. But Hone’s wildfire risks are
lower, said Laura Farris, a weather service meteorologist in
Honolulu.</p>
<p>The August 8, 2023, blaze that torched the historic town of Lahaina
caused the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century. Powerful
winds whipped up in part by a hurricane passing to Hawaii’s south helped
fuel the flames that killed 102 people. Dry, overgrown grasses and
drought helped spread the fire.</p>
<p>The state’s two power companies, Hawaiian Electric and the Kauai
Island Utility Cooperative, said they would be monitoring conditions
this weekend and ready to shut off power if necessary to reduce the
chance that live, damaged powerlines could start fires.</p>
<p>The cause of the Lahaina blaze is still under investigation, but it’s
possible it was ignited by bare electrical wire and leaning power poles
toppled by the strong winds.</p>
<p>Moving westward across the Pacific behind Hone was Category 2
Hurricane Gilma, but it was expected to weaken over cooler waters as it
encounters drier air in coming days and was forecast to become a
tropical depression by Wednesday. Gilma may bring rain to Hawaii, but
it’s not clear how much, Farris said.</p>

id="they-dont-make-em-like-that-any-more-borland-turbo-pascal-7">They
don’t make ’em like that any more: Borland Turbo Pascal 7</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>All, in all, It was much easier to program for Windows using Turbo
Pascal 7 than with anything else. Not only did it provide a programming
model that matched the way the Windows user interface worked, the
application itself had a Windows graphical interface – many Windows
programming tools at that time actually ran under MSDOS, and were
entirely text-based. TP 7 also had fully-graphical tools for designing
the user interface elements, like menus and icons. Laying out a menu
using a definition file with an obscure format, using Windows Notepad,
was never an agreeable experience. Microsoft did produce graphical tools
for this kind of operation, but Turbo Pascal combined them into a
seamless IDE. All I had to do to build and run my programs was to hit
the F7 key. I could even set breakpoints for the debugger, just by
clicking a line of code. As I said, common enough today, but
revolutionary for early Windows programming. ↫ Kevin Boone Even as a
mere child who didn’t even know what programming was, I was aware of
Turbo Pascal. It was a name that you just encountered all over the place
as a DOS and Windows 3.x user, even if you didn’t know what it was. The
author of this article, Kevin Boone, even claims Turbo Pascal
“contributed to the widespread uptake, and eventual domination, of
Microsoft Windows on desktop PCs”, which is not something I can verify
because I was far too young, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it holds
water. This article made me wonder if Pascal is easy to learn, and if
someone wanting to learn programming can do worse than start with a
Windows 3.x virtual machine and Turbo Pascal. Sure, it’s probably not
very relevant today, but it might serve as a good, solid base to work
from? I have no idea.</p>

history deepdive: why do we have different frame types?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>The history of Ethernet is fascinating. The reason why we have three
different frame types is that DIX used the Ethernet II frame that is
prevalent today, while IEEE intended to use a different frame format
that could be used for different MAC layers, such as token bus, token
ring, FDDI, and so on. The IEEE were also inspired by HDLC, and modeled
their frame header more in alignment with the OSI reference model that
had the concept of SAPs. When they discovered that the number of
available SAPs weren’t enough, they made an addition to the 802 standard
to support SNAP frames. In networks today, Ethernet II is dominant, but
some control protocols may use LLC and/or SNAP frames. ↫ Daniel Dib I
just smiled and nodded.</p>

<h2>
Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?
</h2>
<p>
I’m a totally blind, gay, writer of fiction and nonfiction. I work in
the audio description space as a writer and Blind Quality Control
specialist/editor, but I also write fiction podcast scripts as well as
novellas and novels. I publish books, and I’m a vibrant advocate for
digital accessibility with regards to blind access.
</p>
<p>
My main love is writing. I love writing fiction stories because I
believe it’s the best kind of education.
</p>
<p>
As for the types of fiction I write, I write romance. Diverse romance,
specifically. I’ve dabbled in erotica, but my work leans more towards
the romance side of the coin with not a lot of smut. I do write about
people like me, awkward, but empathetic people and their love journeys.
Others have also said I’m a great humor writer, but I don’t consider
myself gut busting funny, but others would disagree!
</p>
<p>
Lastly, I write screenplays and TV show seasons, but my main writing
love has always been writing romance books and novellas and fiction
podcast scripts.
</p>
<p>
I’m also an accessibility consultant. Trust me, I don’t love the
accessibility consulting, but I’m passionate about accessibility and
accessible design because it’s how I can access the web.
</p>
<p>
As for my hobbies? I read a lot of books, consume a lot of fiction
podcasts, and eat a lot of cookies. I’m a digital nomad so I work
entirely remotely.
</p>
<h2>
What’s the story behind your blog?
</h2>
<p>
I knew that I always wanted my own website. I didn’t want to be beholden
to any tech corporation hosting my content, let alone censor me because
people find sex gross but somehow find hateful opinions to be just fine
and dandy. My blog is all over the place. Blind readers will get
tutorials on how to use something with a screen reader. Publishing
people will get thoughts and opinions about disability representation in
the industry and the media published by various publishers. Other people
will find snapshots of experiences and how I feel about them. My blog
isn’t one thing. It’s a mix mash of things.
</p>
<p>
I always wanted a space of my own to just dump thoughts and stories and
otherwise onto the internet without having a corporation control what I
can say or who sees it. With an RSS feed, my writings aren’t controlled
by an algorithm or someone paying to drown out my post with their latest
sponsored content.
</p>
<p>
I didn’t like where WordPress was headed with their Gutenberg editor at
all, so I went looking for a static site generator I could use. I know
how to read code, and I know how to write in some internet languages,
but I really didn’t want to host my own site. I wanted to pay someone to
host my stuff but also let me to exact control sometimes. Also, I needed
a platform that was going to be screen reader accessible from the
beginning. Very few publishing platforms are screen reader accessible,
so my options are limited, but I didn’t want to do Micro Blogging. I
like writing long content because lengthy writing lends itself to more
introspection and thought.
</p>
<p>
I knew I didn’t want to narrow down my blog to a particular theme. I
knew it was going to be me. It was going to be a platform to promote my
work, for me to tell stories, and for me to talk to other people. I
finally found a web host that was willing to host my blog for a fee.
</p>
<h2>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?
</h2>
<p>
If I am doing a nonfiction piece, I gather up all links and references
in a text editor and just keep a running list of references and links
until I’m done with that post. I write to old boy bands like Simple Plan
and similar. I also write to environmental sounds, or I have a playlist
of mood songs and use that when I want to really lean into a fiction
scene. When I write novels, I write all the best/most interesting scenes
first, then I go back and write what happens before and after the most
interesting scenes. Same for screenplays and fiction podcast scripts.
</p>
<h2>
Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the
physical space influences your creativity?
</h2>
<p>
I always write at a desk with a full keyboard. I never write on my phone
unless I have a Bluetooth keyboard with me. If I write in public, I
always people watch and eavesdrop on random conversations because that’s
fantastic ways to study people and how they interact with others. I
write a lot in libraries because I don’t have to buy anything, and I can
reserve rooms all day if I want to write away from home, all for free.
</p>
<h2>
A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech
stack?
</h2>
<p>
The blog is currently a CMS called ClassicPress hosted by Project Army.
As for how I write, if I write in HTML or similar, I then write in
Markdown or a similar fashion in a plain text editor. I write all my
novels in plain text and or Markdown then convert them later. I write
all my screenplays and fiction podcast scripts in Fountain. Those are
all plain text solutions. After I’m all done, I convert the plain text
screenplay or novel into a formatted book or formatted screenplay using

<h2>
Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do
anything differently?
</h2>
<p>
If I had to start over, I’d go with a static site generator first
because it will have better longevity than a CMS database. I wouldn’t
change anything else. The title, content, anything.
</p>
<h2>
Financial question since the Web is obsessed with money: how much does
it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost, or does it generate some
revenue? And what’s your position on people monetizing personal blogs?
</h2>
<p>
I pay about $200 biannually for my blog to be hosted. I rely entirely on
donations and a shared funding model where people financially sponsor my
hosts and otherwise to keep me online. I’m fully reader supported, and
the blog doesn’t make a profit. I’m not intending to sell people’s data
or have ads on my blog. That’s just a poor reader experience. I often
joke that if you want to take me offline, just stop donating to me,
because that will be the day I finally just let the blog go.
</p>
<h2>
Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out?
And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?
</h2>
<p>
I highly recommend the podcast/blog Reid my Mind radio. I also think you
should check out Jonathan Mosen blog. I listen to more podcasts than I
read any particular blog, which is ironic because I have over 100 RSS
feeds, but I don’t have any particular blog recommendations. I do
recommend people read some fanfiction on Archive of Our Own, though!
</p>
<h2>
Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?
</h2>
<p>
Because I’m such a fiction podcast guru, I’d highly recommend checking
out the Fiction Podcast the Bright Sessions or the Two Princes. I’d also
suggest the best place, I think, to find fiction podcasts is
<a href="https://www.theend.fyi/">https://www.theend.fyi/</a> but I also
recommend watching any movie with audio description enabled and not
looking at the screen. You can find movies with audio description at

<h2 id="north-korea-condemns-new-us-nuclear-strategic-plan-report">North
Korea condemns new US nuclear strategic plan report</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Seoul, South Korea — North Korea vowed Saturday to advance its
nuclear capabilities, reacting to a report that the United States had
revised its own nuclear strategic plan.</p>
<p>The country will “bolster up its strategic strength in every way to
control and eliminate all sorts of security challenges that may result
from Washington’s revised plan,” the official Korean Central News Agency
(KCNA) reported.</p>
<p>The New York Times reported this week that a U.S. plan approved by
President Joe Biden in March was to prepare for possible coordinated
nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea.</p>
<p>The highly classified plan for the first time reorients Washington’s
deterrent strategy to focus on China’s rapid expansion in its nuclear
arsenal, the Times said.</p>
<p>KCNA said North Korea’s foreign ministry “expresses serious concern
over and bitterly denounces and rejects the behavior of the U.S.”</p>
<p>It added North Korea vowed to push forward the building of nuclear
force sufficient and reliable enough to firmly defend its
sovereignty.</p>
<p>Pyongyang and Moscow have been allies since North Korea’s founding
after World War II and have drawn even closer since Russia’s 2022
invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The United States and Seoul have accused North Korea of providing
ammunition and missiles to Russia for its war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Pyongyang, which has declared itself an “irreversible” nuclear
weapons power, has described allegations of supplying weapons to Russia
as “absurd.”</p>
<p>However, it did thank Russia for using its United Nations veto in
March to effectively end monitoring of sanctions violations just as UN
experts were starting to probe alleged arms transfers.</p>
<p>China, also a key ally of North Korea, presents itself as a neutral
party in Russia’s offensive on Ukraine and says it is not sending lethal
assistance to either side, unlike the United States and other Western
nations.</p>
<p>But it is a close political and economic ally of Russia, and NATO
members have branded Beijing a “decisive enabler” of the war.</p>
<p>Moscow has looked to Beijing as an economic lifeline since the
Ukraine conflict began, with the two boosting trade to record highs as
Russia faces heavy sanctions from the West.</p>

in Virginia find colonial-era garden, clues about slaves who tended
it</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>williamsburg, virginia — Archaeologists in Virginia are uncovering
one of colonial America’s most lavish displays of opulence: an
ornamental garden where a wealthy politician and enslaved gardeners grew
exotic plants from around the world. </p>
<p>Such plots dotted Britain’s colonies and served as status symbols for
the elite. They were the 18th-century equivalent of buying a
Lamborghini. </p>
<p>The garden in Williamsburg belonged to John Custis IV, a tobacco
plantation owner who served in Virginia’s colonial legislature. He is
perhaps best known as the first father-in-law of Martha Washington. She
married future U.S. President George Washington after Custis’ son Daniel
died. </p>
<p>Historians also have been intrigued by the elder Custis’ botanical
adventures, which were well-documented in letters and later in books.
And yet this excavation is as much about the people who cultivated the
land as it is about Custis. </p>
<p>“The garden may have been Custis’ vision, but he wasn’t the one doing
the work,” said Jack Gary, executive director of archaeology at Colonial
Williamsburg, a living history museum that now owns the property.
“Everything we see in the ground that’s related to the garden is the
work of enslaved gardeners, many of whom must have been very
skilled.” </p>
<p>Posts, paths</p>
<p>Archaeologists have pulled up fence posts that were 3 feet (1 meter)
thick and carved from red cedar. Gravel paths were uncovered, including
a large central walkway. Stains in the soil show where plants grew in
rows. </p>
<p>The dig also has unearthed a pierced coin that was typically worn as
a good-luck charm by young African Americans. Workers have also found
the shards of an earthenware chamber pot, or portable toilet, that
likely was used by people who were enslaved. </p>
<p>Animals appear to have been intentionally buried under some fence
posts. They included two chickens with their heads removed, as well as a
single cow’s foot. A snake without a skull was found in a shallow hole
that had likely contained a plant. </p>
<p>“We have to wonder if we’re seeing traditions that are non-European,”
Gary said. “Are they West African traditions? We need to do more
research. But it’s features like those that make us continue to try and
understand the enslaved people who were in this space.” </p>
<p>The museum tells the story of Virginia’s colonial capital through
interpreters and restored buildings on 300 acres (120 hectares), which
include parts of the original city. Founded in 1926, the museum did not
start telling stories about Black Americans until 1979, even though more
than half of the 2,000 people who lived there were Black, the majority
enslaved. </p>
<p>In recent years, the museum has boosted efforts to tell a more
complete story, while trying to attract more Black visitors. It plans to
reconstruct one of the nation’s oldest Black churches and is restoring
what is believed to be the country’s oldest surviving schoolhouse for
Black children. </p>
<p>There also are plans to re-create Custis’ Williamsburg home and
garden, known then as Custis Square. Unlike some historic gardens, the
restoration will be done without the benefit of surviving maps or
diagrams, relying instead on what Gary described as the most detailed
landscape archaeology effort in the museum’s history. </p>
<p>The garden disappeared after Custis’ death in 1749. But the dig has
determined it was about two-thirds the size of a football field, while
descriptions from the time refer to lead statues of Greek gods and
topiaries trimmed into balls and pyramids. </p>
<p>Correspondence with Briton</p>
<p>The garden’s legacy has lived on through Custis’ correspondence with
British botanist Peter Collinson, who traded plants with other
horticulturalists around the globe. From 1734 to 1746, Custis and
Collinson exchanged seeds and letters via merchant ships crossing the
Atlantic. </p>
<p>The men possibly introduced new plants to their respective
communities, said Eve Otmar, Colonial Williamsburg’s master of historic
gardening. For instance, Custis is believed to have made one of
Williamsburg’s earliest written mentions of growing tomatoes, known then
as “apples of love” and native to Mexico and Central and South
America. </p>
<p>Custis’ gardeners also planted strawberries, pistachios and almonds,
among 100 other imported plants. It’s not always clear from his letters
which were successful in the Virginia climate. A recent pollen analysis
of the soil indicates the past presence of stone fruits, such as peaches
and cherries, which weren’t a big surprise. </p>
<p>The garden existed at a time when European empires and slavery were
still expanding. Botanical gardens often were used for discovering new
cash crops that could enrich colonial powers. </p>
<p>But Custis’ garden was primarily about showing off his wealth. A
study of the area’s topography placed his garden in direct view of
Williamsburg’s only church house at the time. Everyone would have seen
the garden’s fence, but few were invited inside. </p>
<p>Exotic lily</p>
<p>Custis delighted his guests with the likes of the crown imperial
lily, which was native to the Middle East and parts of Asia, and boasted
clusters of drooping, bell-shaped flowers. </p>
<p>“In the 18th century, those were unusual things,” Otmar said. “Only
certain classes of people got to experience that. A wealthy person today
— they buy a Lamborghini.” </p>
<p>The museum is still trying to learn more about the people who worked
in the garden. </p>
<p>Crystal Castleberry, Colonial Williamsburg’s public archaeologist,
has met with descendants of the more than 200 people who were enslaved
by the Custis family on his various plantations. But there is too little
information in surviving documents to determine if an ancestor lived and
worked at Custis Square. </p>
<p>Two people, named Cornelia and Beck, were listed as property with the
Williamsburg estate after Daniel Custis died in 1757. But their names
prompt only more questions about who they were and what happened to
them. </p>
<p>“Are they related to one another?” Castleberry asked. “Do they fear
being split up or sold? Or are they going to be reunited with loved ones
on other properties?”</p>

id="florida-quietly-removes-lgbtq-travel-info-from-state-website">Florida
quietly removes LGBTQ+ travel info from state website</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Key West, Fort Lauderdale, Wilton Manors and
St. Petersburg are among several Florida cities that have long been top
U.S. destinations for LGBTQ tourists. So it came as a surprise this week
when travelers learned that Florida’s tourism marketing agency quietly
removed the “LGBTQ Travel” section from its website sometime in the past
few months.</p>
<p>Business owners who cater to Florida’s LGBTQ tourists said Wednesday
that it marked the latest attempt by officials in the state to erase the
LGBTQ community. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis previously championed a
bill to forbid classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender
identity, and supported a ban on gender-affirming care for minors, as
well as a law meant to keep children out of drag shows.</p>
<p>“It’s just disgusting to see this,” said Keith Blackburn, who heads
the Greater Fort Lauderdale LGBT Chamber of Commerce. “They seem to want
to erase us.”</p>
<p>The change to Visit Florida’s website was first reported by NBC News,
which noted a search query still pulls up some listings for
LGBTQ-friendly places despite the elimination of the section.</p>
<p>John Lai, who chairs Visit Florida’s board, didn’t respond to an
email seeking comment Tuesday. Dana Young, Visit Florida’s CEO and
president, didn’t respond to a voicemail message Wednesday, and neither
did the agency’s public relations director.</p>
<p>Visit Florida is a public-private partnership between the state of
Florida and the state’s tourism industry. The state contributes about
$50 million each year to the quasi-public agency from two tourism and
economic development funds.</p>
<p>Florida is one of the most popular states in the U.S. for tourists,
and tourism is one of its biggest industries. Nearly 141 million
tourists visited Florida in 2023, with out-of-state visitors
contributing more than $102 billion to Florida’s economy.</p>
<p>Before the change, the LGBTQ section on Visit Florida’s website had
read, “There’s a sense of freedom to Florida’s beaches, the warm weather
and the myriad activities — a draw for people of all orientations, but
especially appealing to a gay community looking for a sense of belonging
and acceptance.”</p>
<p>Blackburn said the change and other anti-LGBTQ policies out of
Tallahassee make it more difficult for him to promote South Florida
tourism since he encounters prospective travelers or travel promoters
who say they don’t want to do business in the state.</p>
<p>Last year, for instance, several civil rights groups issued a travel
advisory for Florida, saying that policies championed by DeSantis and
Florida lawmakers are “openly hostile toward African Americans, people
of color and LGBTQ+ individuals.”</p>
<p>But visitors should also understand that many Florida cities are
extremely inclusive, with gay elected officials and LGBTQ-owned
businesses, and they don’t reflect the policies coming from state
government, Blackburn added.</p>
<p>“It’s difficult when these kinds of stories come out, and the state
does these things, and we hear people calling for a boycott,” Blackburn
said. “On one level, it’s embarrassing to have to explain why people
should come to South Florida and our destination when the state is doing
these things.”</p>

id="sidelined-at-the-dnc-pro-palestinian-democrats-still-see-progress">Sidelined
at the DNC, pro-Palestinian Democrats still see progress</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Chicago — Hundreds of pro-Palestinian delegates were sidelined at the
Democratic National Convention that ended with Vice President Kamala
Harris reaffirming her support for Israel.</p>
<p>“The people of Israel must never again face the horror that a
terrorist organization called Hamas caused on October 7,” she said in
her speech accepting the party’s presidential nomination Thursday
evening.</p>
<p>As anti-war protesters filled the streets throughout the week, 270
pro-Palestinian Democrats calling themselves “cease-fire delegates”
signed a petition demanding Harris, if she’s elected, enact an arms
embargo on Israel.</p>
<p>The unheeded petition was pushed by leaders of the “Uncommitted”
movement, which garnered hundreds of thousands of votes in Democratic
primaries across the nation.</p>
<p>These delegates staged a sit-in outside Chicago’s United Center, the
convention’s venue, to protest the Democratic National Committee, who
denied a speaking request for Tanya Haj-Hassan, a pediatric doctor who
treats wounded children in Gaza.</p>
<p>The DNC, according to Uncommitted National Movement spokesperson
Layla Elabed, didn’t want Harris to be “overshadowed.”</p>
<p>Asked by VOA for a reaction to Elabed’s claim, the Harris campaign
said, “There have been a number of speakers who have spoken about the
war in Gaza and the need to secure a cease-fire and hostage deal.”</p>
<p>Uncommitted delegates</p>
<p>Elabed spoke to VOA on behalf of the 30 “Uncommitted” delegates who
voted present in the nomination roll call. That’s less than 1% of the
roughly 4,700 delegates who voted for Harris.</p>
<p>The pro-Palestinian group, however, was given a speaking opportunity
Monday in a panel event outside of the convention.</p>
<p>Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a Muslim sympathetic to the
Palestinian cause who spoke on the panel, was given time at the
convention main stage on Wednesday. However, he did not mention Gaza in
his speech.</p>
<p>The war in Gaza is “not the topic that I would decide” to speak
about, Ellison told VOA before his speech, indicating that pragmatism is
key to affect change within the party.</p>
<p>“I’m not one of those people who believe that we vote for perfection.
What we vote for is conversation,” he said.</p>
<p>Party platform supports Israel</p>
<p>As the convention kicked off, Democrats voted to adopt the party’s
platform that recommitted support for Israel, a cease-fire for hostage
release deal and the two-state solution.</p>
<p>Pro-Palestinian delegates tried to include language backing
enforcement of laws that ban giving military aid to individuals or
security forces that commit gross violations of human rights.</p>
<p>“What we are asking is that our tax dollars not be used to kill men,
women and children. This is not a controversial demand and is actually
more aligned with our Democratic values,” Elabed said.</p>
<p>Compared to Biden, Harris appears to offer more sympathy for
Palestinian suffering, repeating Thursday of the “devastating” situation
in Gaza over the past 10 months.”</p>
<p>“So many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for
safety, over and over again,” she said in her convention speech. “The
scale of suffering is heartbreaking.”</p>
<p>But policy-wise she signaled continuity from the current
administration.</p>
<p>“President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel
is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and
the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security,
freedom and self-determination,” she said in her speech to thunderous
applause.</p>
<p>Harris’ current and former aides say her Israel policy is unlikely to
diverge from President Joe Biden. Halie Soifer, national security
adviser to Harris while she was in the Senate, said that the vice
president has always been a “strong supporter of the U.S.-Israel
relationship,” while upholding humanitarian values.</p>
<p>“She does not want to see the suffering of innocent civilians, nor do
the vast majority of Americans and Jewish Americans,” said Soifer, who
is now CEO of Jewish Democratic Council of America.</p>
<p>“We don’t have to view it through binary lens,” she told VOA. “We
support both.”</p>
<p>Not discouraged</p>
<p>Uncommitted delegates say they’re not discouraged.</p>
<p>Inga Gibson, a delegate from Hawaii, a state where seven out of 31
delegates are uncommitted, said she has made “tremendous progress” with
her fellow delegates.</p>
<p>“I found that a lot of people are really with us on this issue, but
they don’t know where to begin or how to get involved,” she told
VOA.</p>
<p>She and other uncommitted delegates gave out keffiyehs, “Democrats
for Gaza” flyers and “No More Bombs” pins. The pro-Palestinian symbols
are emblematic of a key area of disagreement among Democrats – how much
support to give to Israel.</p>
<p>Pro-Israel delegates say it should not create division within the
party.</p>
<p>“We can all do better to try to understand the complications of the
conflict,” Andrew Lachman, a delegate from California told VOA. “We’re
all concerned about the civilians of Gaza, but we’re also concerned
about the people of Israel and their safety and security.”</p>
<p>Polls show an increasing number of Americans want their leaders to
reduce support for Israel. Some say Harris missed an opportunity.</p>
<p>As a former prosecutor, Harris can and should strictly enforce laws
and suspend weapons even to allies who violate international or U.S.
law, said Nancy Okail, president and CEO of the Center for International
Policy, a left-leaning think tank.</p>
<p>“She could make clear this doesn’t just apply to their misuse by
Israel to cause disproportionate civilian harm in Gaza, but to their
misuse by Netanyahu’s extremist government to dispossess and abuse
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>Turning protest into agenda</p>
<p>Scholars of social movements say it takes time and work to turn
protests into a political agenda. Elisabeth Clemens, a sociologist from
the University of Chicago, said that includes building coalitions,
negotiating and compromising.</p>
<p>“Finding a way forward that almost never gets all the way to where
the protesters hoped it would get but is nevertheless an important
change,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>And on an issue as complicated as the Middle East peace process,
there are different pressures exerted on multiple sides.</p>
<p>“American domestic politics only garners a slice of that,” she
said.</p>
<p>Elabed said they’re in for the long game.</p>
<p>“Our strategy is not to abandon the Democratic Party, but to
essentially revolutionize the Democratic Party and listen to its core
base.”</p>
<p>For now, the vice president is their best bet.</p>
<p>“I don’t care what you think, you need to win to have power,” Ellison
said. “Harris, the numbers are up everywhere. The chances for success
are higher.”</p>

<h2 id="vibe-check-34">Vibe Check №34</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-24, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
The temperatures soared over 100ºF and the yard is dead and everything
smells roasted. But the ten day forecast shows a ten degree dip and that
is cause for celebration. Another school year has started. My son has
started middle school and my daughter is now in third grade. It’s
shocking how fast life goes. And on the workfront, the pace is picking
up now that everyone has come back from summer vacation.
</p>
<p>
A lot has transpired since the previous vibe check (vacations, new pets,
rock shows). To start it off, my family escaped the heat and went to San
Diego (as is the custom) for one good week and one awful week…
</p>
<h2>
San Diego: The First Good Week
</h2>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/sandiego.jpg" alt="Left: a pink beach drink. Right a dark sunset over Mission Bay San Diego" />
</p>
<p>
We flew out to Phoenix to join up with my wife’s family and caravan out
to San Diego. We had a family dinner the night before and got to see my
one year old grandnephew for the first time in a long while. He’s a
sweet kid but does not want his Granduncle Dave holding him yet.
</p>
<p>
The next day we loaded up the beach gear and drove to a resort in
Mission Beach in San Diego for a four day stay. We had a great time with
my wife’s family letting the cousins run loose while grown-ups played
tennis, pickleball, and I played my annual round of golf with my male
in-laws. After four days of big family time we scooted up to Encinitas
to stay for two nights with our Austin friends whose summer rental had a
guest house.
</p>
<p>
Encinitas was super charming. We stayed near
<a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g32355-d12186525-Reviews-Beacon_s_Beach-Encinitas_California.html">Beacons
Beach</a> which is one of those cool beaches at the bottom of a
cliffside. We beached pretty hard. My daughter and her oldest bestie
pranced up and down the shoreline for hours and she even learned to
surf. The contrast between Mission and Encinitas couldn’t be more stark.
The trip could have ended there and would have been one of the best
vacations in the books. But we weren’t done! We planned to extend the
trip with a one-week rental in Mission Bay.
</p>
<h2>
San Diego: The Second Awful Week
</h2>
<p>
The minute we checked into our beachside rental the whole vibe shifted.
From tranquil Encinitas to getting blasted with the sounds (and smells)
of Mission Beach. Honking, motorcycles, bottles clanking, fighting,
garbage trucks, neighbors blasting bad music, and smells drifting up
from the alleyway. It felt like going from a yoga retreat to a frat
house. Then it got worse. That night our daughter said she didn’t feel
well and the next day my wife started going downhill.
</p>
<p>
A week of beach fun turned into spending thousands of dollars to be sick
inside a beach-adjacent summer rental watching SpongeBob Squarepants on
repeat. After three urgent care visits over two days the sick members of
our party had the required antibiotics to start feeling better. The next
day, we went home.
</p>
<p>
And –as if it couldn’t get any better– I got COVID on the plane ride
back. Ughck.
</p>
<h2>
We adopted two new pups
</h2>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/dogs.jpg" alt="One black dog with one brown eye and one blue eye and a black and white dog with pointy ears and two blue eyes, both staring at the camera" />
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Laneige (aka “Laney”) - A black lab mix with one brown eye and one blue
eye. She’s an attention thief who is not shy about demanding pets.
</li>
<li>
Rosebud - A lab mix with expressive pointy ears and two blue eyes (some
heeler in there?). She’s the more anxious of the two, but once
befriended will roll over for belly rubs.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Our kids have been asking for a new dog for over a year. Every day this
summer I’d step into the house and my daughter would spin a laptop
around to show me the new dogs she found on
<a href="https://www.austinpetsalive.org/">the Austin Pets Alive!
website</a>. She even wrote a song to try to convince me to get a dog.
🥺 They were dead set on a pup named “Laneige” (named by the shelter
after a Korean lip balm).
</p>
<p>
After dropping the kids off at grandma’s house for a long weekend, we
set our plan into action: adopt a dog and surprise the kids. But our
plans changed when the shelter brought out Laneige’s sister Rosebud
(also named after a lip balm) to our meet and greet. Her pointy ears and
blue eyes were too cute. We tend to play it more conservative when it
comes to big life choices but we decided to go full stupid for once and
surprise the kids with not one dog, but two dogs!
</p>
<p>
Names may change and we daily ask ourselves “Did we overdo it?” but
generally we’re happy with the new additions.

A year ago Brad Frost called my wife and I to share a wild idea for his
40th birthday party: get all his musician friends from all over the
world together on one stage for one night of rocking out. Over the
course of the next year we picked songs, learned parts, recorded tracks,
hoping –but never knowing– how it would all turn out when we assembled
in Pittsburgh for one night of rock.
</p>
<p>
It. Was. Phenomenal.
</p>
<p>
Nothing could have prepared me for the blast from the five piece horn
section. It sounded perfect. It felt big. Dozens of people on stage
playing together for the first time, but you wouldn’t know it. Music
–good music– filling the halls of an old church. I’m a foot away from a
bass guitar amp but I can’t hear the bass because there’s so much music
happening. In the crowd I see people listening to my wife sing –they’re
singing along– and it takes me back to when I first heard her sing at a
karaoke bar in Los Angeles when I fell in love with her.

Outside the main event, it felt good to put kindling on some
friendships. I got to see <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/">Chris</a>,
which is always pleasant to see the one person I’m guaranteed to have an
hour long conversation every week.
<a href="https://www.zachmeyer.com/">Zach</a> &amp; Danh (my co-hosts
from <a href="https://asidequest.simplecast.com/">Aside Quest</a>) flew
up on the same flight. But I got to see and chat with new and old
friends as well; <a href="https://ianfrostweather.com/">Ian</a>,

countless more folks. Since the US web development conference scene has
more or less imploded since the pandemic, this felt a bit like a family
reunion with some of my favorite people from around the world.
</p>
<p>
In the end,
<a href="https://frostapalooza.bradfrost.com/">Frostapalooza</a> was a
magical night celebrating the power of music and friendship. It feels a
bit like a dream now and when I explain it to people my words fall
short. An ephemeral joyous moment and I have no idea if I’ll do anything
like that in my life again. That’s special. The biggest thanks to Brad,
Melissa, and Ella who sacrificed a lot of time, money, and life-force to
pull it off.

<h2>
The stats, o the stats.
</h2>
<p>
Okay, quantifiers. Calm down. Here’s your beefsteak of itemized inputs
and outputs.

<h3>
🧠 Learning
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
When I got sick I did a deep dive in playing with
<a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> and building a vault. I’m
still on Notion (for now) but the jump is less intimidating. I like the
indie/privacy angle of Obsidian a lot but from a UX perspective it feels
“finicky” when mousing over content in a way that Notion doesn’t. The
level of customization is also nicer in Obsidian, but also a potential
endless rabbit hole for my distracted brain. Moving my “second brain” is
not a task I want to take lightly.
</li>
<li>
Watching countless Obsidian videos exposed me to a new organization
system: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d93SGaf82OM">August
Bradley’s “Pillars, Pipelines, and Vaults” (PPV) system</a>. I’m not
ready to ditch
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2022/04/productivity-sniped-by-para/">my
Notion PARA setup</a>, but the idea PPV introduces that I’m gravitating
towards is that my brain is a system of “Inputs” (links, books, and
notes vaults) and “Outputs” (blog posts, side projects, and task
pipelines) and those exist across “Areas” (pillars) in my life. Inputs
need organization (e.g. folders and/or tags) and outputs need a process
(e.g. <a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/09/my-notion-blogging-kanban/">a
kanban</a>). I think Obsidian fits this paradigm better than Notion.

📖 <strong>Reading</strong>

<p>
Not my best summer of reading but I’m enjoying the slower pace.

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://amzn.to/4ckSatD">Like, Comment, Subscribe</a> by Mark
Bergen - The history of YouTube. A great look into how this product
which changed the world evolved (and also failed to evolve).

<li>
<a href="https://amzn.to/4foUaD6">Read Write Own</a> by Chris Dixon - On
a recommendation I read a book about crypto. Shockingly, I didn’t
disagree with much here… except that crypto is the solution to the
problems outlined in the book. He spent chapters pitching ideas that
crypto could solve (decentralized social networks, carrying over video
game assets, etc) and those have since been debunked. There’s
<em>still</em> no job that crypto does better than a database.
Ultimately I think it’s a question of “Who benefits?” when it comes to
this technology and I think the answer is: the people who already own a
lot of it.
</li>
<li>
Humankind by Rutger Bregman - I’ve read this book before but it’s a
pleasant little dose of positivity. Are we humans that trample each
other while leaving a burning plane? Or are we humans that help each
other get off the plane? The answer might surprise you.
</li>
<li>
Slow Productivity by Cal Newport - I liked this book better than the
last but I think it suffers from the same problems all his books do…
he’s shielded by academia and not that busy of a person. I laughed out
loud when he used Jane Austen as an example of Slow Productivity
(paraphrasing) “After her father sold the farm and the school and they
moved to a beach town, she was able to slow down.” Like, yeah dude, I
could slow down too if my dad retired and sold the literal farm.

<strong>Anime</strong>
</p>

Goldenboy (1995) - Full of fan service but has a main character that
flips the genre on its head a bit.
</li>
<li>
Mob Psycho 100 S2 (2019) - Mob is at it again. Such a weird, fun series.
</li>
<li>
Gundam Breaker Battlogue (2021) - A short web series to promote a new
line of Gundam models. Not my favorite “Builder” series nor is it my
favorite line of Gundam models. Battlogue on all fronts feels rushed and
cheap.

need to pony up cash or figure out another way to race.

</p>
<p>
I built the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfmD1yYqP6k">Perfect Grade
Unleashed RX-78-2 Gundam</a> - The granddaddy of all granddaddies. This
was an incredible build start to finish. I stalled out for two weeks
over adhering some metal etching parts but I tried out different glues
and cements and ended up using a
<a href="https://www.scotchbrand.com/3M/en_US/p/d/cbgnhw011037/">Scotch
Restickable Glue Stick</a> (the same glue for Post-it Notes) and it
worked great.
</p>
<p>
From the inner frame to the outer shell of the body armor, this model is
jaw dropping. It has heft, but not too heavy. It poses but feels sturdy.
Bandai nestled in gimmicks everywhere but also so subtle you’d never
know they were there from a distance. I need to finish putting on all
the stickers, but it’s already so incredible to look at that I fear
over-decorating.
