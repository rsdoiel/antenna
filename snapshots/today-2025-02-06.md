## Quoting Andrej Karpathy

date: 2025-02-06, updated: 2025-02-06, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383"><p>There's a new kind of coding I call "vibe coding", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It's possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard.</p>
<p>I ask for the dumbest things like "decrease the padding on the sidebar by half" because I'm too lazy to find it. I "Accept All" always, I don't read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I'd have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can't fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away.</p>
<p>It's not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing. I'm building a project or webapp, but it's not really coding - I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.</p></blockquote>

## Fukuoka, Japan

date: 2025-02-06, from: mrusme blog

"Fukuoka is the sixth-largest city in Japan and the capital city of Fukuoka
Prefecture, Japan. The city is built along the shores of Hakata Bay, and has
been a center of international commerce since ancient times. The area has long
been considered the gateway to the country, as it is the nearest point among
Japan's main islands to the Asian mainland. Although humans occupied the area
since the Jomon period, some of the earliest settlers of the Yayoi period
arrived in the Fukuoka area. The city rose to prominence during the Yamato
period. Because of the cross-cultural exposure, and the relatively great
distance from the social and political centers of Kyoto, Osaka, and later, Edo
(Tokyo), Fukuoka gained a distinctive local culture and dialect that has
persisted to the present."

## Various Ways How I, a Gay Man, Use the Word “Mama”

date: 2025-02-06, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p><strong>&#8220;We’re OK, Mama&#8221;</strong><br /> When I’ve had great banter with the server the whole night, and she comes up to us to ask if there’s anything else we need before she brings the check.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;OK, Mama!!!&#8221;</strong><br /> Giving praise to a friend for any minor accomplishment.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;Mama, are you OK?&#8221;</strong> <br /> When my friend is going through a tough breakup, and he wants to dye his hair platinum blond and is now obsessed with catching the Knockdown Center Killer.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;OK, Mamá&#8221;</strong> <br /> After my Venezuelan mother reminded me to text my aunt for her birthday.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;Mama…&#8221;</strong><br /> When my friend has been at this new job for only six months, and they tell me they want to quit without a backup plan.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;Oh, Mama!&#8221;</strong> <br /> Johnny Bravo.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;Oh, Mama, we’re not doing that&#8221;</strong> <br /> At a party after I get cornered by my friend’s friend from Florida who wants to talk at me about the success of the DeSantis administration.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;Mama, don’t&#8221;</strong><br /> Whenever Jeremy Allen White is going to engage in self-sabotaging behavior in any piece of film or TV he’s in.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;Mama, please&#8221;</strong> <br /> When my boss is telling me we have to make the PowerPoint more digestible because the <span class="caps">CEO</span> of the company doesn’t understand the data.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;Oh no, you don’t, Miss Mama&#8221;</strong><br /> I’m babysitting, and my niece steals the remote from her younger brother because she wants to watch one of those weird YouTube videos where someone is just opening Kinder Surprise Eggs for an hour.</p> <p><strong>[<i>Head tilted down</i>] &#8220;Mama&#8221;</strong><br /> When my friend is about to text the guy that’s been ghosting her.</p> <p><strong>[<i>Head titled up, eyes widened</i>] &#8220;Mama&#8221;</strong><br /> When I’m bored at a party, and my friend takes out a joint.</p> <p><strong>[<i>Blink, blink, blink</i>] … … … &#8220;Mama&#8221;</strong><br /> Someone has just asked me to go to their improv show at 11 p.m. on a Tuesday.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;Yes, Mama!&#8221;</strong> <br /> When a guy who is flirting with me but I’m not interested in romantically asks me if I want to get coffee.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;Yes, Mamaaa!!!&#8221;</strong> <br /> When a guy I am flirting with responds, “Let’s do it, diva,” when I ask him to get coffee, so I pretend I wasn’t asking him out on a date.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;Not the place, Mama.&#8221;</strong> <br /> Waiting in line to get bagels, and my friend has just started going into graphic detail about his sex life, and I’m sex-positive and want to celebrate anyone comfortable in their own body, but I’m hungry, and perhaps there’s an internalized homophobia that I haven’t fully examined in therapy yet, so I feel embarrassed, and while I do consider that probably nobody is listening to our conversation, I cannot fight the urge to shut it down.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;Oh, it’s tough out there, Mama.&#8221;</strong> <br /> When my friend quit their job without a backup plan gets rejected from their fiftieth job application.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;Mama?&#8221;</strong> <br /> Hiking with my lesbian friend, and she is much further ahead, and I am now alone in the woods.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;Go off, Mama!&#8221;</strong><br /> We got a flat tire, and I want to call <span class="caps">AAA</span>, but my lesbian friend says she can change it herself.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;That’s what you get, Mama.&#8221;</strong> <br /> When my girlfriend has an ugly bridesmaid dress that she doesn’t want to wear after I warned her that being a bridesmaid was a bad idea.</p>

## S1: The $6 R1 Competitor?

date: 2025-02-05, updated: 2025-02-05, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://timkellogg.me/blog/2025/02/03/s1">S1: The $6 R1 Competitor?</a></strong></p>
Tim Kellogg shares his notes on a new paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19393">s1: Simple test-time scaling</a>, which describes an inference-scaling model fine-tuned on top of Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct for just $6 - the cost for 26 minutes on 16 NVIDIA H100 GPUs.</p>
<p>Tim highlight the most exciting result:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After sifting their dataset of 56K examples down to just the best 1K, they found that the core 1K is all that's needed to achieve o1-preview performance on a 32B model.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The paper describes a technique called "Budget forcing":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To enforce a minimum, we suppress the generation
of the end-of-thinking token delimiter and optionally append
the string “Wait” to the model’s current reasoning trace to
encourage the model to reflect on its current generation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's the same trick Theia Vogel described <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/22/r1py/">a few weeks ago</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the <code>s1-32B</code> model <a href="https://huggingface.co/simplescaling/s1-32B">on Hugging Face</a>. I found a GGUF version of it at <a href="https://huggingface.co/brittlewis12/s1-32B-GGUF">brittlewis12/s1-32B-GGUF</a>, which I ran using <a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a> like so:</p>
<pre><code>ollama run hf.co/brittlewis12/s1-32B-GGUF:Q4_0
</code></pre>
<p>I also found those 1,000 samples on Hugging Face in the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/simplescaling/s1K">simplescaling/s1K</a> data repository there.</p>
<p>I used DuckDB to convert the parquet file to CSV (and turn one <code>VARCHAR[]</code> column into JSON):</p>
<pre><code>COPY (
    SELECT 
      solution,
      question,
      cot_type,
      source_type,
      metadata,
      cot,
      json_array(thinking_trajectories) as thinking_trajectories,
      attempt
    FROM 's1k-00001.parquet'
) TO 'output.csv' (HEADER, DELIMITER ',');
</code></pre>
<p>Then I loaded that CSV into <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/">sqlite-utils</a> so I could use the <code>convert</code> command to turn a Python data structure into JSON using <code>json.dumps()</code> and <code>eval()</code>:</p>
<pre><code># Load into SQLite
sqlite-utils insert s1k.db s1k output.csv --csv
# Fix that column
sqlite-utils convert s1k.db s1u metadata 'json.dumps(eval(value))' --import json
# Dump that back out to CSV
sqlite-utils rows s1k.db s1k --csv &gt; s1k.csv
</code></pre>
<p>Here's that CSV <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/048385f27e351c11b488bd9737452fa7">in a Gist</a>, which means I can <a href="https://lite.datasette.io/?install=datasette-pretty-json&amp;csv=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/simonw/048385f27e351c11b488bd9737452fa7/raw/5270dacc5aa4a7385f9a6e3d691c81cf3595abc9/s1k.csv#/data/s1k?_facet=cot_type">load it into Datasette Lite</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of Datasette Lite showing cot_type 1, crossword 15, Link: 93, rowid: 93, solution: &quot;### Answer: INCIDENT ROOM ### Explanation: Definition: investigators' facility **Anagram of**(... changes) NOTICED MINOR.

## Here at DOGE, We’ve Streamlined Every Aspect of America’s Collapse

date: 2025-02-05, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p><i>&quot;Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent gave representatives of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency access to the federal payment system late on Friday, according to five people familiar with the change, handing Elon Musk and the team he is leading a powerful tool to monitor and potentially limit government spending. &#8212; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-federal-payments-system.html">New York Times</a></i></p> <div class='break'>- - -</div><p>A lot of people doubted that my Department of Government Efficiency (<span class="caps">DOGE</span>) could do what it set out to do. But I am proud to say that in just weeks, we have used the Tesla, SpaceX, and X playbook to make America’s collapse much more efficient.</p> <p>It’s been obvious for years that the US system was declining with great waste and sluggishness. For example, did you know that before <span class="caps">DOGE</span> came along, government spending was influenced by an ad hoc network of billionaires behind campaign contributions, dark money groups, and shadowy think tanks? It&#8217;s far more efficient to reduce redundancy by placing the entire US Treasury under the centralized control of just <i>one</i> billionaire private citizen (me).</p> <p>Or consider the waste and bloat in how the US government used to give away taxpayer dollars via an overcomplicated system of lobbying, tax breaks, and bloated contracts. This will become much more optimized once I force the entire US population to pay a 5 percent transaction fee to conduct Social Security transactions on X, The Everything Website (20 percent if they have pronouns in their bio).</p> <p>Plus, now I can Control+F SpaceX competitors, put them into bankruptcy with one click, and seamlessly Alt+Tab back to <i>Diablo IV</i>.</p> <p>We are also hustling to streamline and reduce redundancy in how Americans’ privacy is violated. Experian breaches, dark web data brokers, unregulated social media, Chinese <span class="caps">PLA</span> hacking? Who has time for it all? Now, we can get this done in one fell swoop by putting every US citizen’s Social Security number on a public Google Sheet administered by the nineteen-year-old who programmed Grok’s sense of humor.</p> <p>My record speaks for itself. I have led X, which will now be crowdsourcing air traffic control via live posts, to become incredibly efficient at serving up pornographic Adolf Eichmann memes.</p> <p>The decline of America’s creditworthiness has also been a halting, stop-start process every time the debt limit approaches. But now, <span class="caps">DOGE</span> will get it done for good, because the teenagers tracking the US government’s credit card balance have killed countless Neuralink monkeys.</p> <p>We are also working weekends to eliminate the middlemen in foreign collusion. Think of how it used to work: winking political speeches, hack-and-leak operations, pro-Kremlin <span class="caps">NATO</span> policies. What a cumbersome system! It is far simpler for me to snort some ketamine and DM Vladimir Putin my US Treasury login during our weekly Teams call.</p> <p>America’s downfall used to be so sprawling and overcomplicated&#8212;classic, low-IQ bureaucrats. Wealth inequality, white nationalism, transphobia, authoritarianism, conspiracy theories? Sure, they’re happening, but are they happening as straightforwardly as possible? Who is coordinating it all? Now I can say confidently the answers to those questions are (1) yes and (2) @ViktorOrbanFan1488, whose other main duty is leveling up my <i>Diablo IV</i> character.</p> <p>Americans cry out for speed and efficiency!</p> <p>For too long, our authoritarianism has been “creeping.”</p> <p>Our oligarchy: “quasi.”</p> <p>Our Nazis: “neo.”</p> <p>But now, Americans will get what they want: a stripped-down, streamlined speed run of 1920s Germany meets <i>Ex Machina</i>.</p> <p>I promise, America will soon be the Cybertruck of countries&#8212;uglier than you could have imagined, built for rich chuds, borderline inoperable, and on fire.</p>

## Gemini 2.0 is now available to everyone

date: 2025-02-05, updated: 2025-02-05, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-updates-february-2025/">Gemini 2.0 is now available to everyone</a></strong></p>
Big new Gemini 2.0 releases today:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gemini 2.0 Pro (Experimental)</strong> is Google's "best model yet for coding performance and complex prompts" - currently available as a free preview.</li>
<li><strong>Gemini 2.0 Flash</strong> is now generally available.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite</strong> looks particularly interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve gotten a lot of positive feedback on the price and speed of 1.5 Flash. We wanted to keep improving quality, while still maintaining cost and speed. So today, we’re introducing 2.0 Flash-Lite, a new model that has better quality than 1.5 Flash, at the same speed and cost. It outperforms 1.5 Flash on the majority of benchmarks.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That means Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite is priced at 7.5c/million input tokens and 30c/million output tokens - half the price of OpenAI's GPT-4o mini (15c/60c).</p>
<p>Gemini 2.0 Flash isn't <a href="https://ai.google.dev/pricing#2_0flash">much more expensive</a>:  10c/million for text/image input, 70c/million for audio input, 40c/million for output. Again, cheaper than GPT-4o mini.</p>
<p>I pushed a new <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> plugin release, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/releases/tag/0.10">llm-gemini 0.10</a>, adding support for the three new models:</p>
<pre><code>llm install -U llm-gemini
llm keys set gemini
# paste API key here
llm -m gemini-2.0-flash "impress me"
llm -m gemini-2.0-flash-lite-preview-02-05 "impress me"
llm -m gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05 "impress me"
</code></pre>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/411d032a84f02e8300b1f48df54913b7">the output</a> for those three prompts.</p>
<p>I ran <code>Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle</code> through the three new models. Here are the results, cheapest to most expensive:</p>
<p><strong>gemini-2.0-flash-lite-preview-02-05</strong></p>
<p><img alt="This is not great. The bicycle is a trapezoid. The pelican is very warped and has a orange diamond beak above its head." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-preview-02-05.svg" /></p>
<p><strong>gemini-2.0-flash</strong></p>
<p><img alt="The bicycle is better but the pelican is yellow and looks more like a baby chick. Its beak is squashed against the side of the image." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-2.0-flash.svg" /></p>
<p><strong>gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05</strong></p>
<p><img alt="This one is pleasingly avant-garde. The bicycle does at least have two wheels joined by a frame. The pelican is a fun shape, and it has a beak with a curved orange top and a curved yellow bottom." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05.svg" /></p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/e50eea6d4f746fb3bc5543d106ffa8e7">Full transcripts here</a>.</p>
<p>I also ran the same prompt I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/5/o3-mini-documentation/">tried with o3-mini the other day</a>:</p>
<pre><code>cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/simonw/datasette
cd datasette
files-to-prompt datasette -e py -c | \
  llm -m gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05 \
  -s 'write extensive documentation for how the permissions system works, as markdown' \
  -o max_output_tokens 10000
</code></pre>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/e20697b792dc62843f8ab5c25bfab15b">the result from that</a> - you can compare that to <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/4a13c4b10176d7b8e3d1260f5dcc9de3">o3-mini's result here</a>.

## An Open Letter to the Old Man Who Bartered with My Cancer-Patient Daughter at the Community Yard Sale Fundraiser

date: 2025-02-05, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p>Dear Old Man Who Bartered with My Cancer-Patient Daughter at the Community Yard Sale Fundraiser,</p> <p>Thank you for attending the Alex&#8217;s Lemonade Stand community yard sale last Saturday. By “attending,” of course, I mean “looming over my ten-year-old daughter’s card table and haggling over the price of a sequined stuffed seal as if your Social Security payments depended on it.”</p> <p>I imagine you saw the sign: <small><span class="caps">ALL</span> <span class="caps">PROCEEDS</span> <span class="caps">DONATED</span> TO <span class="caps">CHARITY</span></small>. The one my daughter painted with her one good hand while still hooked to a chemo pump like she’s the saddest science experiment ever.</p> <p>Or maybe you noticed the giant cardboard cutout of her: bald head gleaming and feeding tube affixed to her nose like a fashion accessory from the Underworld’s spring/summer collection. The only thing better than having cancer is reminding the whole goddamn neighborhood about it with oversized props.</p> <p>The table was covered with donated items: books, knickknacks, toys. Nothing priced over five dollars. This wasn’t Sotheby’s. This wasn’t even Goodwill. And yet, you, a grown man (and card-carrying member of <span class="caps">AARP</span> by my estimation) clutched a sequined stuffed seal like it was the Hope Diamond, and asked if I could knock it down from two dollars to one dollar.</p> <p>You saw a child with cancer sitting next to a sign that screamed, “All this money will help kids like me <i>not die</i>,” and you thought, <i>I think I’ll argue over the price of a mismatched salt shaker set</i>.</p> <p>When you woke up that morning and decided to show your face in public, did you think, <i>You know what today needs? A child with cancer being forced to justify her pricing structure to me.</i></p> <p>What is it that makes a functioning adult man look at a feeding tube and think, <i>Ah, but what about my bottom line?</i></p> <p>What were you going to do with that dollar you saved? Put it toward your retirement? Buy a hot dog at the Costco food court? Have you been saving up for a six-dollar latte, and my daughter&#8217;s blood cancer was in the way of your pumpkin spice destiny?</p> <p>Or was it about <i>principle</i>? Were you staging a stand against price gouging at pediatric cancer fundraisers? History will not remember you as its hero. There will be no documentaries called <i>The Man Who Saved Fifty Cents from Big Charity</i>.</p> <p>Don’t think I didn’t notice your wife trying to disappear into the bushes. She was shaking her head like she was trying to clear a swarm of bees, mouthing, <i>I don’t even like him!</i></p> <p>You stood there wearing cargo shorts with about sixteen functional pockets and an aggressive cologne and thought, <i>These kids may be sick, but I still need to save a dollar so I can afford the early-bird special at <span class="caps">IHOP</span>.</i> Do pancakes taste better after you make a bald child explain, “No, sir, the three-dollar stained-glass coaster set is not negotiable”?</p> <p>I hope that sequined stuffed seal becomes a cursed object in your life. Its beady gaze will follow you around your house. Your granddaughter will pick it up, stare into the teal galaxies of its plastic eyes, and say, &#8220;Grandpa, this is the saddest toy I&#8217;ve ever seen. Did a dying kid give this to you?&#8221;</p> <p>May the little gently used seal appear in your dreams. May it show up in strange places around your house: the bathroom mirror, your car dashboard, the freezer next to your generic-brand frozen waffles&#8212;its flip sequins spelling out: <small><span class="caps">ALL</span> <span class="caps">PROCEEDS</span> <span class="caps">COULD</span> <span class="caps">HAVE</span> <span class="caps">GONE</span> TO <span class="caps">KIDS</span> <span class="caps">WITH</span> <span class="caps">CANCER</span>, <span class="caps">YOU</span> <span class="caps">SELFISH</span> <span class="caps">PRICK</span></small>.</p> <p>One day, when you shuffle off this mortal coil and stare into the abyss of whatever budget-tier afterlife awaits you, that fucking sequined seal will be there waiting. I hope it waddles up, its eyes sparkling teal and orange in the flames, and squeaks out, “Remember me, asshole?”</p> <p>Back here in the mortal world, on the funeral home’s memorial page, I hope your family adds a link at the end of your obituary for people to make a donation to Alex’s Lemonade Stand in your dishonor.</p> <p>Sincerely,<br /> Elizabeth Austin (The Mom Hosting the &#8220;Kick a Cheap Old Man for Charity&#8221; Booth at This Year’s Community Yard Sale Fundraiser)</p>

## o3-mini is really good at writing internal documentation

date: 2025-02-05, updated: 2025-02-05, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/4a13c4b10176d7b8e3d1260f5dcc9de3">o3-mini is really good at writing internal documentation</a></strong></p>
I wanted to refresh my knowledge of how the Datasette permissions system works today. I already have <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/authentication.html">extensive hand-written documentation</a> for that, but I thought it would be interesting to see if I could derive any insights from running an LLM against the codebase.</p>
<p>o3-mini has an input limit of 200,000 tokens. I used <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> and my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/files-to-prompt">files-to-prompt</a> tool to generate the documentation like this:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre><span class="pl-c1">cd</span> /tmp
git clone https://github.com/simonw/datasette
<span class="pl-c1">cd</span> datasette
files-to-prompt datasette -e py -c <span class="pl-k">|</span> \
  llm -m o3-mini -s \
  <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>write extensive documentation for how the permissions system works, as markdown<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre></div>

<p>The <code>files-to-prompt</code> command is fed the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/tree/main/datasette">datasette</a> subdirectory, which contains just the source code for the application - omitting tests (in <code>tests/</code>) and documentation (in <code>docs/</code>).</p>
<p>The <code>-e py</code> option causes it to only include files with a <code>.py</code> extension - skipping all of the HTML and JavaScript files in that hierarchy.</p>
<p>The <code>-c</code> option causes it to output Claude's XML-ish format - a format that works great with other LLMs too.</p>
<p>You can see the output of that command <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/1922544763b08c76f0b904e2ece364ea">in this Gist</a>.</p>
<p>Then I pipe that result into LLM, requesting the <code>o3-mini</code> OpenAI model and passing the following system prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>write extensive documentation for how the permissions system works, as markdown</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Specifically requesting Markdown <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/2/openai-reasoning-models-advice-on-prompting/">is important</a>.</p>
<p>The prompt used 99,348 input tokens and produced 3,118 output tokens (320 of those were invisible reasoning tokens). That's <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/llm-prices">a cost</a> of 12.3 cents.</p>
<p>Honestly, <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/4a13c4b10176d7b8e3d1260f5dcc9de3">the results</a> are fantastic. I had to double-check that I hadn't accidentally fed in the documentation by mistake.</p>
<p>(It's possible that the model is picking up additional information about Datasette in its training set, but I've seen similar <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/adf64108d65cd5c10ac9fce953ab437e">high quality results</a> from other, newer libraries so I don't think that's a significant factor.)</p>
<p>In this case I already had extensive written documentation of my own, but this was still a useful refresher to help confirm that the code matched my mental model of how everything works.</p>
<p>Documentation of project internals as a category is notorious for going out of date. Having tricks like this to derive usable how-it-works documentation from existing codebases in just a few seconds and at a cost of a few cents is wildly valuable.

## Ambsheets: Spreadsheets for exploring scenarios

<p><strong><a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/ambsheets/">Ambsheets: Spreadsheets for exploring scenarios</a></strong></p>
Delightful UI experiment by Alex Warth and Geoffrey Litt at Ink &amp; Switch, exploring the idea of a spreadsheet with cells that can handle multiple values at once, which they call "amb" (for "ambiguous") values. A single sheet can then be used to model multiple scenarios.</p>
<p>Here the cell for "Car" contains <code>{500, 1200}</code> and the cell for "Apartment"  contains <code>{2800, 3700, 5500}</code>, resulting in a "Total" cell with six different values. Hovering over a calculated highlights its source values and a side panel shows a table of calculated results against those different combinations.</p>
<p><img alt="Spreadsheet showing budget items with values in cells: Column A shows Budget, Car, Apartment, Netflix, and TOTAL. Column B shows values including x̄ = 850 for Car with values 500 and 1,200; x̄ = 4,000 for Apartment with values 2,800, 3,700, and 5,500; Netflix shows 18; TOTAL row shows x̄ = 4,868 with values 3,318, 4,218, 6,018, 4,018, 4,918, and 6,718. Right side shows formula =sum(b3:b5), TABLE with aggregate avg dropdown, and STACKS visualization of the values." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/amb-sheets.jpg" /></p>
<p>Always interesting to see neat ideas like this presented on top of UIs that haven't had a significant upgrade in a very long time.

## AI-generated slop is already in your public library

date: 2025-02-05, updated: 2025-02-05, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.404media.co/ai-generated-slop-is-already-in-your-public-library-3/">AI-generated slop is already in your public library</a></strong></p>
US libraries that use the <a href="https://www.hoopladigital.com/">Hoopla</a> system to offer ebooks to their patrons sign agreements where they pay a license fee for anything selected by one of their members that's in the Hoopla catalog.</p>
<p>The Hoopla catalog is increasingly filling up with junk AI slop ebooks like "Fatty Liver Diet Cookbook: 2000 Days of Simple and Flavorful Recipes for a Revitalized Liver", which then cost libraries money if someone checks them out.</p>
<p>Apparently librarians already have a term for this kind of low-quality, low effort content that predates it being written by LLMs: vendor slurry.</p>
<p>Libraries stand against censorship, making this a difficult issue to address through removing those listings. </p>
<p>Sarah Lamdan, deputy director of the American Library Association says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If library visitors choose to read AI eBooks, they should do so with the knowledge that the books are AI-generated.</p>
</blockquote>
