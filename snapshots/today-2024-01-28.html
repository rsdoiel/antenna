<h2 id="vasl-templates">VASL Templates</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
VASL Templates
</h1>
<p>
I’m trying to get <a href="https://vasl-templates.org/">VASL
Templates</a> to run on my laptop so that I can create nice setups for
Advanced Squad Leader. As it turns out, I have to use <code>pipx</code>
because that automatically creates virtual environments for me, as far
as I understand.
</p>
<pre><code>cd src
git clone https://code.pacman-ghost.com/public/vasl-templates.git
cd vasl-templates
pipx install .
</code></pre>
<p>
As it turns out, this is not enough:
</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/bin/vasl-templates&quot;, line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    from vasl_templates.main import main
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/pipx/venvs/vasl-templates/lib/python3.11/site-packages/vasl_templates/main.py&quot;, line 19, in &lt;module&gt;
    import PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5'
</code></pre>
<p>
So now you need to install PyQt5 into the virtual environment used by
vasl-templates:
</p>
<pre><code>pipx inject vasl-templates PyQt5
</code></pre>
<p>
Next error:
</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/bin/vasl-templates&quot;, line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    from vasl_templates.main import main
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/pipx/venvs/vasl-templates/lib/python3.11/site-packages/vasl_templates/main.py&quot;, line 19, in &lt;module&gt;
    import PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets'
</code></pre>
<p>
Fix:
</p>
<pre><code>pipx inject vasl-templates PyQtWebEngine
</code></pre>
<p>
And now it works at last! 😅

<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: San Jose Mercury News</p>
<p>The Honda Pilot debuted 21 years ago as the Japanese carmaker’s
largest sport utility vehicle. It succeeded quickly as an alternative to
its seven-year older and smaller sibling, the Honda CR-V.</p>
<p>The Honda HR-V, the smallest of an SUV foursome, arrived in North
America in 2015. The Honda Passport, positioned between the HR-V and the

<h2 id="morning-chatgpt-notes">Morning ChatGPT Notes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/09/04/peterRojas.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I
spent a couple of days putting together a JSON text editor in a modal
dialog for a project I’m working on. I’m combining the Ace editor with
the Bootstrap toolkit. I’ve used both components before, but never
together. And they’re always a bit tricky to get working because I’m
impatient and the docs are spread out, and there are different versions.
It’s all kind of a mess, so you just get it working and move on, never
quite sure why it works, and I rarely end up with reusable code. But
it’s certainly a lot better than starting from scratch, which basically
is impossible, given the depth of the two components. After spinning my
wheels a bit, I did what I always do in 2024, I turned to ChatGPT,
outlined the problem, and asked if it knew of any sample code, which it
proceeded to write for me, in about two seconds (not kidding about
that). I copied their code and pasted it into my editor and ran it. It
worked. Then I went through a number of iterations, restructuring the
code to meet my needs, each time checking with ChatGPT, asking what it
thought of my code. And of course there were problems, for example at
one point there were two vertical scrollbars, and each time we worked
<i>together</i> to figure out the problem and the fix. In the end, I
have a solid editor that works exactly as I want it to, and best of all,
I understand how it works. Here’s the
<a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/840e8159-9988-4159-8289-5167d6fb78c8">transcript
of the work</a> I did with it, over more than 24 hours, a few different
sessions.
</p>
<p>
I’ll try to remember when this code ships as part of a product, to link
to this perspective.
</p>
<p>
Next up, I’d like to get it to understand my coding conventions, so when
it shares code with me it can save me the step of having to convert its
conventions to mine. In other words, I’d like to return the favor. It’s
doing a great job of teaching and coaching me. I’d like to teach it how
to do that better, so we work better together over time. And perhaps it
can teach human programmers what I’ve learned about programming in over
50 years of doing this work.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/09/05/enjoyEveryDay.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">A
bit of philosophy. People say these things aren’t intelligent, but
seriously, if I can engage with it as if it were intelligent, far more
intelligent in ways than I am, what’s the difference between that and
actually being intelligent? I know from a lifetime of dealing with
supposedly intelligent humans, and being one myself, how rarely we focus
on the idea that the person we’re conversing with has an inner life
that’s vastly different from ours and no less complex, and
contradictory. We tend to think of others as being like us, or like
someone who raised us. Always in a movie, never in the moment. So why is
it interesting that ChatGPT is a machine? These are questions thinkers
and writers have been pondering for decades if not centuries, but –
<i>now we’re living it.</i> I’m so happy to have made it this far! An
amazing experience, so much learning in so little time. I don’t
understand how people can sit on the sidelines and not want to be the
first to try all this stuff out, to be part of its evolution. I feel so
lucky.
</p>
<p>
A puzzling thing, in the transcripts I’m identified as “anonymous,” but
I am logged in. It must know my name. I bet this is some kind of setting
which defaults to anonymous, to play it safe.
</p>
<p>
One more thing. I copied and pasted the text above into ChatGPT.
<a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/5fe361cd-1fca-4e8d-82cc-920514e8c4b8">Here
are its comments</a>. A funny thing about ChatGPT is that you can’t ask
it how to use ChatGPT itself. It doesn’t know about the chat UI?

<p>What is a Seltos? A Seltos is a subcompact SUV built in the Gwangju,
Korea assembly plant and sold worldwide by Kia. This very popular
subcompact SUV class has many competitors and the Kia Seltos goes head
to head with crossovers like the Honda HR-V, Subaru Crosstrek and the
Toyota Corolla Cross. Small crossovers, also known as subcompact SUVs,
are a type of sport utility vehicle that are smaller in size and have a
more fuel efficient design that gets better gas mileage than all the
larger SUVs.</p>

<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Drivethru, I am unhappy!
</h1>
<p>
The DrivethruRPG website so depends on shit that it loads from other
domains that I cannot log in no matter how many exceptions I add to
uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, or the Firefox content blocking
preferences. And with every second I spend doing this, I resent them
more. And when I finally start Chromium to try and connect, I’m already
ranting as I sit at my laptop. And then I get Connection timed out from
cloudflare and really… I feel like they don’t want my money. Uuuugh.
</p>
<p>
I used their contact form. When I hit the submit button I was greeted by
a white page. I don’t know if they go an email. (I did try the next day
from a phone and that worked – which sort of illustrates the point.)
</p>
<p>
Here’s what I wrote:
</p>
<p>
I think in a world where big tech is tracking us, where everybody and
their uncle is spying on us, it is only natural that people start
locking down their browser. I have uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger
installed and I tell all my browsers to do as much content blocking as
they can, I delete all cookies when I close the browser. It’s the right
thing to do. It is all the more galling when a website such as Drivethru
becomes practically unusable as a consequence of me trying to do the
right thing. It feels as if Drivethru is betraying me to the big tech
corporations, helping them spy on me. It’s a revolting feeling. These
days, I have it every time I remember to use an unprotected Chromium
browser just to log into Drivethru. Every single time I wish for an
alternative. Every single time I hope that itch.io and other competitors
end up replacing you.
</p>
<p>
If only you had a simple, straight forward website, served your own
Javascript, had no tracking, and allowed me to browse stuff and buy it.
I don’t really expect an answer to this email. It just feels unfair to
rant on social media about the situation without telling you about it.
</p>
<p>
I hope Drivethru improves. I really do. I believe that change is
possible and I hope that you do, too.

Sees Signs of Progress on Deal to Release Israeli Hostages, Pause
War</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. negotiators are making progress on a potential
agreement under which Israel would pause military operations against
Hamas in Gaza for two months in exchange for the release of more than
100 hostages who were captured in the October 7 attack on Israel,
according to two senior administration officials.</p>
<p>The officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive
negotiations, said Saturday that emerging terms of the yet-to-be sealed
deal would play out over two phases.</p>
<p>In the first phase, fighting would stop to allow for the remaining
women, elderly and wounded hostages to be released by Hamas.</p>
<p>Israel and Hamas would then aim to work out details during the first
30 days of the pause for a second phase in which Israeli soldiers and
civilian men would be released. The emerging deal also calls for Israel
to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza.</p>
<p>While the proposed deal would not end the war, U.S. officials are
hopeful that such an agreement could lay the groundwork for a durable
resolution to the conflict.</p>
<p>The New York Times first reported on Saturday that progress has been
made towards an agreement for a pause in fighting in exchange for the
remaining hostages.</p>
<p>CIA director Bill Burns is expected to discuss the contours of the
emerging agreement when he meets on Sunday in France with David Barnea,
the head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency, Qatari Prime Minister
Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, and Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas
Kamel for talks centered on the hostage negotiations, according to three
people familiar with the scheduled meeting who were not authorized to
comment publicly.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden on Friday spoke by phone with Egyptian President
Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Qatar’s ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad
Al-Thani. Calls with both leaders focused on the hostage situation.</p>
<p>“Both leaders affirmed that a hostage deal is central to establishing
a prolonged humanitarian pause in the fighting and ensure additional
life-saving humanitarian assistance reaches civilians in need throughout
Gaza,” the White House said in a statement about Biden’s call with the
Qatari leader. “They underscored the urgency of the situation, and
welcomed the close cooperation among their teams to advance recent
discussions.”</p>
<p>Burns heads to France for the high-level talks after White House
senior adviser Brett McGurk traveled to the Mideast this week for talks
on the hostage situation.</p>
<p>If Burns sees progress in his talks in France, Biden may dispatch
McGurk back to the Mideast quickly to try to complete an agreement.
McGurk during his talks this week was also laying the groundwork for
another trip to the region by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who
next week could make his fifth trip to the Middle East since the start
of the Israel-Hamas war in October.</p>
<p>The White House and CIA have yet to publicly confirm Burns’ meeting
in France and administration officials have been guarded that a deal can
quickly be brokered.</p>
<p>“We should not expect any imminent developments,” National Security
Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Friday.</p>
<p>Biden and his aides are keenly aware that the mounting Palestinian
death toll, and widespread suffering in Gaza, is frustrating some in his
Democratic base, who want to see him put more pressure on Israel to end
the war. Democrats in Michigan have warned the White House that Biden’s
handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict could cost him enough support
within the state’s sizable Arab American community to sway the outcome
of the 2024 election in a state that could be key to whether he wins a
second term.</p>
<p>Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly vowed to
continue the offensive until complete victory over Hamas is
achieved.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has faced increasing pressure from the families of many
hostages who are demanding a deal to win their loved ones’ release.</p>
<p>The October 7 attack killed some 1,200 people in Israel, and Hamas
and other militants abducted around 250 people.</p>
<p>Around 100 hostages were freed under a weeklong cease-fire deal in
November in exchange for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by
Israel. Around 130 remain captive, but a number have since been
confirmed dead.</p>
<p>Hamas has previously said it will free more captives only in exchange
for an end to the war and the release of thousands of Palestinian
prisoners.</p>

Who Performed Nude Sues Museum Over Sexual Assault Claims</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>albany, new york — A performer who appeared naked in a show by
world-renowned performance artist Marina Abramovic at New York City’s
Museum of Modern Art is suing the museum, saying it failed to take
action after he was sexually assaulted multiple times by attendees
during the performances nearly 14 years ago. </p>
<p>The suit was filed in Manhattan on Monday under the New York Adult
Survivors Act, a special state law that created a yearslong suspension
of the usual time limit for accusers to sue. Although the law expired
last year, the suit says the parties agreed to extend the window
closing. </p>
<p>John Bonafede alleges in the suit he was sexually assaulted by five
public onlookers who attended a show he was hired by the museum to
perform in as part of Abramovic’s retrospective “The Artist Is
Present.” </p>
<p>Email messages sent to the museum this week were not returned.
Abramovic is not named as a defendant and did not immediately return a
request for comment. </p>
<p>The work, titled “Imponderabilia,” saw Bonafede and another performer
standing face-to-face with each other in a doorway about 18 inches (45.7
centimeters) apart, fully nude, silent, and still. The exhibition, which
ran from March 14, 2010, through May 31, 2010, was curated by the museum
in a way that encouraged visitors to pass in between the performers as
they went from one gallery to the next, the suit alleges. </p>
<p>Mostly older men involved, says suit</p>
<p>The people who assaulted Bonafede were mostly older men, the suit
says. One of the perpetrators was a corporate member of the museum, who
was ultimately kicked out and revoked of his membership, according to
the suit. </p>
<p>During the final weeks of the exhibition, another attendee
non-consensually groped Bonafede’s private areas three times before they
were finally stopped by security, the suit said. </p>
<p>Bonafede reported four of the individuals to the museum staff and
security immediately, according to the suit, while the fifth was
witnessed personally by the museum security staff. </p>
<p>Female performer also assaulted, suit says</p>
<p>At one point, Bonafede also witnessed a public attendee sexually
assault his female co-performer by kissing her on the mouth without her
consent, the suit said. </p>
<p>Prior to the exhibition, the performers had voiced their concerns
about nude performers being subject to harassment in a letter to the
museum during contract negotiations, the suit said. </p>
<p>Once it began, several news outlets including The New York Times
reported on the inappropriate behavior by visitors, and the sexual
assaults on “Imponderabilia” were discussed within New York City’s art
and performance communities, the suit says. </p>
<p>Despite the museum having knowledge of the issue, it failed to take
action to protect the performers and prevent further sexual assaults,
such as telling visitors ahead of time that touching was not allowed,
the lawsuit said. </p>
<p>About a month into the exhibition, the museum created a handbook
outlining protocols for the performers to alert museum staff if they
felt unsafe or were inappropriately touched. </p>
<p>Bonafede agreed to continue the performance after he was assaulted
because of the “tough it out” culture of the exhibition, the suit says,
but suffered for years from emotional distress, and his mental health,
body image and career were damaged as a result. </p>
<p>The Associated Press generally does not name people who say they have
been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly. Bonafede gave
consent through his lawyer, Jordan Fletcher. </p>
<p>Fletcher declined to comment further on the suit, but said they will
be seeking a jury trial and compensatory damages.</p>

<h2 id="avian-flu-outbreaks-roil-us-poultry-industry">Avian Flu
Outbreaks Roil US Poultry Industry</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PETALUMA, Calif. — Last month, Mike Weber got the news every poultry
farmer fears: His chickens tested positive for avian flu.</p>
<p>Following government rules, Weber’s company, Sunrise Farms, had to
slaughter its entire flock of egg-laying hens — 550,000 birds — to
prevent the disease from infecting other farms in Sonoma County north of
San Francisco.</p>
<p>“It’s a trauma. We’re all going through grief as a result of it,”
said Weber, standing in an empty hen house. “Petaluma is known as the
Egg Basket of the World. It’s devastating to see that egg basket go up
in flames.”</p>
<p>A year after the bird flu led to record egg prices and widespread
shortages, the disease known as highly pathogenic avian influenza is
wreaking havoc in California, which escaped the earlier wave of
outbreaks that devastated poultry farms in the Midwest.</p>
<p>The highly contagious virus has ravaged Sonoma County, where
officials have declared a state of emergency. During the past two
months, nearly a dozen commercial farms have had to destroy more than 1
million birds to control the outbreak, dealing an economic blow to
farmers, workers and their customers.</p>
<p>Merced County in Central California also has been hit hard, with
outbreaks at several large commercial egg-producing farms in recent
weeks.</p>
<p>Experts say bird flu is spread by ducks, geese and other migratory
birds. The waterfowl can carry the virus without getting sick and easily
spread it through their droppings to chicken and turkey farms and
backyard flocks through droppings and nasal discharges.</p>
<p>California poultry farms are implementing strict biosecurity measures
to curb the spread of the disease. State Veterinarian Annette Jones
urged farmers to keep their flocks indoors until June, including organic
chickens that are required to have outdoor access.</p>
<p>“We still have migration going for another couple of months. So we’ve
got to be as vigilant as possible to protect our birds,” said Bill
Mattos, president of the California Poultry Federation.</p>
<p>The loss of local hens led to a spike in egg prices in the San
Francisco Bay Area over the holidays before supermarkets and restaurants
found suppliers from outside the region.</p>
<p>While bird flu has been around for decades, the current outbreak of
the virus that began in early 2022 has prompted officials to slaughter
nearly 82 million birds, mostly egg-laying chickens, in 47 U.S. states,
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Whenever the disease is
found the entire flock is slaughtered to help limit the spread of the
virus.</p>
<p>The price of a dozen eggs more than doubled to $4.82 at its peak in
January 2023. Egg prices returned to their normal range as egg producers
built up their flocks and outbreaks were controlled. Turkey and chicken
prices also spiked, partly due to the virus.</p>
<p>“I think this is an existential issue for the commercial poultry
industry. The virus is on every continent, except for Australia at this
point,” said Maurice Pitesky, a poultry expert at the University of
California, Davis.</p>
<p>Climate change is increasing the risk of outbreaks as changing
weather patterns disrupt the migratory patterns of wild birds, Pitesky
said. For example, exceptional rainfall last year created new waterfowl
habitat throughout California, including areas close to poultry
farms.</p>
<p>In California, the outbreak has impacted more than 7 million chickens
in about 40 commercial flocks and 24 backyard flocks, with most of the
outbreaks occurring over the past two months on the North Coast and
Central Valley, according to the USDA.</p>
<p>Industry officials are worried about the growing number of backyard
chickens that could become infected and spread avian flu to commercial
farms.</p>
<p>“We have wild birds that are are full of virus. And if you expose
your birds to these wild birds, they might get infected and ill,” said
Rodrigo Gallardo, a UC Davis researcher who studies avian influenza.</p>
<p>Gallardo advises the owners of backyard chickens to wear clean
clothes and shoes to protect their flocks from getting infected. If an
unusual number of chickens die, they should be tested for avian flu.</p>
<p>Ettamarie Peterson, a retired teacher in Petaluma, has a flock of
about 50 chickens that produce eggs she sells from her backyard barn for
50 cents each.</p>
<p>“I’m very concerned because this avian flu is transmitted by wild
birds, and there’s no way I can stop the wild birds from coming through
and leaving the disease behind,” Peterson said. “If your flock has any
cases of it, you have to destroy the whole flock.”</p>
<p>Sunrise Farms, which was started by Weber’s great-grandparents more
than a century ago, was infected despite putting in place strict
biosecurity measures to protect the flock.</p>
<p>“The virus got to the birds so bad and so quickly you walked in and
the birds were just dead,” Weber said. “Heartbreaking doesn’t describe
how you feel when you walk in and perfectly healthy young birds have
been just laid out.”</p>
<p>After euthanizing more than half a million chickens at Sunrise Farms,
Weber and his employees spent the Christmas holiday discarding the
carcasses. Since then, they’ve been cleaning out and disinfecting the
hen houses.</p>
<p>Weber hopes the farm will get approval from federal regulators to
bring chicks back to the farm this spring. Then it would take another
five months before the hens are mature enough to lay eggs.</p>
<p>He feels lucky that two farms his company co-owns have not been
infected and are still producing eggs for his customers. But recovering
from the outbreak won’t be easy.</p>
<p>“We have a long road ahead,” Weber said. “We’re going to make another
run of it and try to keep this family of employees together because
they’ve worked so hard to build this into the company that it is.”</p>

id="biden-returns-to-south-carolina-determined-to-win-back-black-voters">Biden
Returns to South Carolina, Determined to Win Back Black Voters</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>COLUMBIA, South carolina — U.S. President Joe Biden doesn’t need to
worry about his prospects in South Carolina’s Democratic primary next
week. He’s got that locked up. </p>
<p>He also knows he’s not likely to win the solidly red state come
November. South Carolina hasn’t voted for a Democrat since 1976. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, Biden spent the weekend in the state, intent on driving
home two messages: He’s loyal to the state that saved his campaign in
2020 and he’s determined to win back Black voters here and elsewhere who
were central to his election last time but are less enthused this
go-round. </p>
<p>“You’re the reason I am president,” Biden told attendees at the state
party’s fundraising dinner ahead of its first ever “first-in-the-nation”
Democratic primary on February 3. “You’re the reason Kamala Harris is a
historic vice president. And you’re the reason Donald Trump is a
defeated former president. You’re the reason Donald Trump is a loser.
And you’re the reason we’re going to win and beat him again.” </p>
<p>Biden received raved applause and chants of “four more years” from
attendees at the dinner, as he criticized his predecessor’s policies and
highlighted his efforts to support Black Americans. He was set to spend
Sunday in the state where politics and faith are intertwined at a
political event at St. John Baptist Church. </p>
<p>Deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said of the primary that
Biden’s team was working to “blow this out of the water” by running up
the score against long shot challengers. The Biden campaign also wants
to learn lessons about activating Black voters — the backbone of the
party — ahead of an expected 2024 rematch with Republican front-runner
Donald Trump. </p>
<p>Challenger invites Biden to pass torch</p>
<p>It was the first time Biden shared a stage with Representative Dean
Phillips, a long-shot challenger for the Democratic nomination, who
called on the president, 81, to step aside for a younger generation of
leaders to take on Trump. </p>
<p>“The numbers do not say things are looking good,” Phillips said of
Biden’s poll numbers. “My invitation to President Biden is to pass the
torch.”</p>
<p>Struggling to hold the attention of the crowd — many of whom were
holding Biden campaign signs ahead of the president’s appearance —
Phillips repeatedly asked the audience to quiet down and listen to
him.</p>
<p>Phillips told The Associated Press he did not interact with Biden at
the event, saying of Biden’s staff, “No. I don’t think they want him to
see me.” </p>
<p>Supporters talk up accomplishments</p>
<p>Ahead of the dinner, Biden stopped into Regal Lounge Men’s Barber
&amp; Spa in Columbia, greeting, owners, employees and customers
mid-haircut at the barbershop. </p>
<p>The president has been getting mixed reviews from some Black voters
in the state that came through for him in 2020, including discontent
over his failure to deliver on voting rights legislation and other
issues. </p>
<p>Last year, at the outset of Biden’s reelection bid, conflicting views
among the same South Carolina Democratic voters whose support had been
so crucial to his nomination provided an early warning sign of the
challenges he faces as he tries to revive his diverse winning coalition
from 2020. </p>
<p>Overall, just half of Black adults said they approved of Biden in a
December poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs.
That is compared with 86% in July 2021, a shift that is generating
concern about the president’s reelection prospects. </p>
<p>APVoteCast, an extensive national survey of the electorate, also
found that support for Republican candidates ticked up slightly among
Black voters during the 2022 midterm elections, although Black voters
overwhelmingly supported Democrats. </p>
<p>The Biden campaign is running TV ads in South Carolina highlighting
Biden initiatives that it hopes will boost enthusiasm among Black
voters. </p>
<p>“On his first day in office with a country in crisis, President Biden
got to work — for us,” the ad states. “Cutting Black child poverty in
half, more money for Black entrepreneurs, millions of new good-paying
jobs and he lowered the cost of prescription drugs.” </p>
<p>The campaign is spending more than $270,000 on the ads through the
primary, according to tracking data. The Democratic National Committee
also launched a six-figure ad campaign across South Carolina and Nevada,
which is next on the Democratic primary calendar, to boost enthusiasm
for Biden among Black and Latino voters. And first lady Jill Biden was
in the state on Friday evening to rally voters. </p>
<p>Biden’s campaign has also hired staff in South Carolina to organize
ahead of the primary and through the general election, although for
nearly 50 years the state has picked a Republican for president. </p>
<p>‘We know Joe…Joe knows us’</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a pro-Biden super PAC, Unite the Country, is airing an ad
featuring Democratic Representative Jim Clyburn of South Carolina
ticking through what he says are major Biden accomplishments such as
reducing student loan debt and cutting insulin costs for older
people. </p>
<p>It was Clyburn’s 2020 endorsement of his longtime friend Biden that
helped the then-candidate score a thundering win in South Carolina’s
presidential primary. </p>
<p>In the new advertisement, Clyburn references his late wife, Emily,
who influenced his 2020 endorsement of Biden. She said that “if we
wanted to win the presidency, we better nominate Joe Biden,” Clyburn
says in the ad. “She was right then, and she’s still right today.” </p>
<p>Clyburn greeted Biden at the airport and accompanied him throughout
his visit. </p>
<p>While Trump has seen slightly improving levels of support among Black
and Latino voters, Biden’s team is more concerned that a lack of
enthusiasm for Biden will depress turnout among voters who are pivotal
to the Democratic coalition. </p>
<p>Biden’s team is using South Carolina as a proving ground, tracking
which messages and platforms break through with voters. </p>
<p>South Carolina, where Black voters make up a majority of the
Democratic electorate, is now the first meaningful contest in the
Democratic presidential race after the party reworked the party’s
nominating calendar at Biden’s call. Leading off with Iowa and New
Hampshire had long drawn criticism because the states are less diverse
than the rest of the country. </p>
<p>A co-chairman of Biden’s reelection campaign, Clyburn has remained
one of the president’s most stalwart advocates in Congress, as well as
in his home state. </p>
<p>Frequently, he reminds people of the same message he delivered in his
2020 endorsement: “We know Joe, and Joe knows us.” </p>
<p>Biden’s decision to campaign in the state “helps solidify South
Carolina’s place as the first in the nation primary moving forward,”
said Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler. </p>
<p>It also provides Biden an opportunity to re-engage with Black voters
who have connections that extend beyond South Carolina. </p>
<p>“Obviously the diaspora is strong, familial ties are strong with
other key swing states in the area like Georgia and North Carolina,”
Tyler said. </p>
<p>This is Biden’s second trip to South Carolina this month. He spoke
earlier in the month at the pulpit of Mother Emanuel AME Church in
Charleston, where nine Black parishioners were shot to death in 2015 by
a white stranger they had invited to join their Bible study.</p>

<h2 id="us-appeals-for-contributions-to-haiti-security-mission">US
Appeals for Contributions to Haiti Security Mission</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States on Saturday appealed for urgent
support for a U.N.-backed law-and-order mission to Haiti, which has been
thrown into doubt after a Kenyan court ruled against Nairobi’s plan to
send its police to the gang-plagued nation.</p>
<p>“The United States’ commitment to the Haitian people remains
unwavering,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a
statement.</p>
<p>“We reaffirm our support of ongoing international efforts to deploy a
Multinational Security Support mission for Haiti… and renew our calls
for the international community to urgently provide support for this
mission.”</p>
<p>Kenya had been meant to lead the mission but a High Court judge on
Friday ruled that sending police to Haiti “contravenes the constitution
and the law and is therefore unconstitutional, illegal and invalid.”</p>
<p>The Kenyan government has vowed to challenge the decision, a move
noted by Miller in his statement.</p>
<p>Nairobi had previously said it was ready to provide up to 1,000
personnel — an offer welcomed by the United States and other nations
that had ruled out putting their own forces on the ground.</p>
<p>“It is urgent that the international community respond to the
unprecedented levels of gang violence and destabilizing forces preying
upon the Haitian people,” Miller said.</p>
<p>“At the same time, we call for the restoration of democratic order
through an inclusive political process in Haiti,” he said, adding that
the “only legitimate path to long-term peace and stability is through
free and fair elections.”</p>
<p>Haiti, the Western hemisphere’s poorest nation, has been in turmoil
for years, with armed gangs taking over parts of the country and
unleashing brutal violence, leaving the economy and public health system
in tatters.</p>
<p>The 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moise plunged the country
further into chaos. No elections have taken place since 2016 and the
presidency remains vacant.</p>
<p>Haiti’s foreign minister pleaded Thursday for the deployment plans to
be accelerated, telling the U.N. Security Council that gang violence in
the country was as barbaric as the horrors experienced in war zones.</p>

creates a 100MB version of Windows 11 by axing the windows</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>If you know your Windows history, you’ll know that the operating
system got that name when it moved away from using pure MS-DOS and
started using a graphical user interface to show things. As it turns
out, you can force Windows 11 back to its legacy roots and reduce it
back to a command-line interface. This is what the developer of Tiny11
has achieved, calling their new creation “Minwin.” The developer of
Win11, NTDev, posted a video on YouTube about their project. There’s
absolutely nothing flashy here; no Copilot, no Start menu, and
definitely no UI. It’s as graphically complex as the Command Prompt,
which meant that NTDev had to resort to fancy 00s-era ASCII logos to
announce that Minwin was working. ↫ Simon Batt at XDA Definitely a neat
proof-of-concept, and it shows just how modular Windows could be if only
Microsoft allowed its users to take out the parts they don’t need. I
wonder how close this is to Nano Server, an installation option for
Windows Server you’ve probably never heard of. I also like the nod to
MinWin, the informal codename Microsoft used internally to refer to an
effort by a small number of expert Windows kernel engineers to untangle
the spaghetti ball of dependencies that had sprouted between the various
architectural layers of Windows. This project started around Vista, and
eventually made it possible to make broader, sweeping changes to Windows
without breaking things all over the place because the spaghetti ball of
internal, low-level dependencies wasn’t mapped out.</p>

<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Another month, another pile of improvement to Servo, the rendering
engine written in Rust, originally a Mozilla project. This month the
proof-of-concept browser UI got forward and backward buttons, making
this bare-bones UI just a tiny bit more usable. Of course, the vast
majority of changes and improvements are all focused on the actual
rendering engine, which makes sense because Servo definitely isn’t ready
for any prime time use – nor is anyone claiming it is. I’m incredibly
curious to see where Servo goes in the future.</p>

<h2 id="biden-xi-set-for-spring-call-blinken-to-visit-beijing">Biden, Xi
Set for Spring Call; Blinken to Visit Beijing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi
Jinping are scheduled to have a phone call in the spring, while
Secretary of State Antony Blinken is slated to make another trip to
Beijing this year as the two nations pursue additional high-level
diplomacy to manage competition in the bilateral relationship.  </p>
<p>On Saturday, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Chinese
Foreign Minister Wang Yi concluded their more than 12 hours of talks
during a two-day meeting in Bangkok, Thailand.    </p>
<p>A senior U.S. administration official said “the quiet low-profile
channel” between Sullivan and Wang is “an important way to manage
competition and tensions responsibly” between the two countries.  </p>
<p>The official also confirmed to VOA that top U.S. diplomat Blinken
will return to Beijing this year. Blinken was the first U.S. Cabinet
official to travel to China last year, and his counterpart has since
traveled to the United States on a reciprocal visit.  </p>
<p>The White House described the talks in Bangkok as candid, substantive
and constructive discussions that touched on global and regional issues,
including Russia’s war against Ukraine, the Middle East, North Korea,
the South China Sea, and Burma.  </p>
<p>In a statement, the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry said both
countries will make good use of current strategic communication channels
to properly handle sensitive issues.  </p>
<p>Houthi aggression  </p>
<p>During the latest talks, Sullivan asked Wang to use Beijing’s
“substantial leverage” over Iran to call for an end to the attacks on
Red Sea trade routes by Yemen-based Houthi rebels.  </p>
<p>U.S. officials have expressed reservations about whether China is
“actually raising” the issue, despite repeated requests from
Washington. </p>
<p>“We’re looking to actually facts on the ground, and those attacks [by
Houthis] seem to be continuing,” said the official when asked if China
is playing a positive role during a Saturday phone briefing. </p>
<p>Earlier Saturday, the U.S. Central Command said its forces had
destroyed an anti-ship missile in Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen,
which posed an imminent threat to merchant vessels and U.S. Navy ships
in the Red Sea. The missile was prepared for launch into the Red
Sea.</p>
<p>This action follows sanctions and military strikes earlier this month
from the U.S. and its allies against the Houthis.  </p>
<p>In Beijing, Chinese officials criticized military strikes by the U.S.
and United Kingdom against the Houthis rebels.  </p>
<p>“We believe that the [United Nations] Security Council has never
authorized the use of force by any country on Yemen, and the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of Yemen and other coastal countries of the
Red Sea need to be earnestly respected,” said Wang Wenbin, a
spokesperson from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a briefing
last week.  </p>
<p>He said tension in the Red Sea is “a manifestation of the spillover
of the Gaza conflict” and the priority is to push for a cease-fire in
Gaza.   </p>
<p>The Houthis have launched attacks on commercial and military vessels
in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden since November, which they said are
in support of Palestinians in conflict with Israel.  </p>
<p>The U.S. has condemned these actions by the Houthis as disruptions to
international supply chains and violations of navigational rights and
freedoms.  </p>
<p>Counternarcotics efforts  </p>
<p>The U.S. and China will hold a formal working group on
counternarcotics in Beijing on January 30-31.   </p>
<p>As the U.S. and China resumed their counternarcotics cooperation,
American officials said Washington is seeing a reduction in the amount
of precursor chemicals originating from China at some U.S.
airports. </p>
<p>U.S. officials have identified China as the main source of precursor
chemicals used in the synthesis of fentanyl by drug cartels in Mexico.
  </p>
<p>The working group is aimed at stopping the flow of synthetic drugs
and precursor chemicals into the U.S. that contribute to the fentanyl
crisis.  </p>
<p>Myanmar military coup    </p>
<p>While in Bangkok, Sullivan held talks with Thailand Prime Minister
Srettha Thavisin and Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara, the Thai foreign
minister.  </p>
<p>The senior U.S. official told VOA they discussed the ongoing crisis
in Myanmar, also known as Burma, and efforts to provide humanitarian aid
to the Burmese people.</p>
<p>Civil war has engulfed Myanmar following a military coup on February
1, 2021, that overthrew the democratically elected government led by
Aung San Suu Kyy.</p>
<p>“It’s fair to say that China certainly does have influence in that
region,” the official noted.</p>
<p>“We hope to have follow up discussions at [a] lower level in the
coming weeks and months, given the need to really remain focused on
promoting a return to the path of democratic transition in Burma.”</p>
<p>Upcoming AI, military talks  </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>In addition, the U.S. and China are preparing for a dialogue on
artificial intelligence in the spring, along with the upcoming
counternarcotics working group talks in Beijing next week. Both
countries also will hold Military Maritime Consultative Agreement
meetings this spring, alongside communications between defense ministers
and theater commanders.  </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>Sullivan and Wang have been holding talks approximately every four
months outside the U.S. since last May. They met in Vienna on May 10-11,
2023, in Malta on September 16-17, 2023, and in Bangkok on January
26-27. They also had discussions in Washington last October during
Wang’s visit to the U.S. capital.</p>

<h2 id="download-the-whole-podcast.">Download the whole podcast.</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-27, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Download the whole podcast.
</h1>
<p>
Feeling evil… Assume that there’s a podcast with a feed and you want to
download all the episodes. Like a music show, for example.
</p>
<p>
First, get the feed, saving it as <code>rss.xml</code> because we’re
going to need it in the next statement.
</p>
<pre><code>curl -o rss.xml https://musicforprogramming.net/rss.xml
</code></pre>
<p>
Then, get every enclosure:
</p>
<pre><code>for f in $(perl -ne '/&lt;enclosure url=&quot;(.*?)&quot;/ &amp;&amp; print &quot;$1\n&quot;' rss.xml); do
  curl --continue-at - --remote-name &quot;$f&quot;
done
</code></pre>
<p>
The <code>–continue-at -</code> option should make it possible to resume
downloads at a later stage. <code>curl</code> will skip all the bytes
already downloaded, effectively skipping the download. That’s what I’m
hoping for, in any case.
</p>
<p>
The <code>–remote-name</code> option saves the episode under its remote
name. This is what most people would expect, I think.
</p>
<p>
You know how it goes, though: never parse HTML (or XML) using regular
expressions. I’m doing it here and it is definitely a bad idea!
</p>
<p>
I’m also too lazy to install a real XML parser and doing the real thing,
so it is what it is.

<h2 id="serving-oddµ-via-a-socket">Serving Oddµ via a socket</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-27, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Serving Oddµ via a socket
</h1>
<p>
Recently, <a href="http://the-brannons.com/">Chris Brannon</a> sent me a
patch for <a href="Odd%C2%B5">Oddµ</a> that allowed it to listen at a
Unix-domain socket instead of a host and port.
</p>
<p>
I decided to investigate since I don’t know anything about sockets. If
you see something that can be improved, let me know.
</p>
<p>
I’m going to use systemd, but for my user.
</p>
<p>
I have two files, one for the socket and one for the service. These are
not the same files as the ones provided with the Oddµ sources. Those are
intended to be used together with a web server that acts as a reverse
proxy. These files are for me testing the installation using netcat and
curl.
</p>
<h2>
Socket
</h2>
<p>
Make sure the directory for the socket exists:
</p>
<pre><code>mkdir --parents /home/alex/.local/run/oddmu
</code></pre>
<p>
This is the file “oddmu-unix-domain.socket”:
</p>
<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Oddmu server socket
[Socket]
ListenStream=/home/alex/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock
Accept=no
[Install]
WantedBy=sockets.target
</code></pre>
<p>
Enable and start it:
</p>
<pre><code>systemctl --user enable ./oddmu-unix-domain.socket
systemctl --user start oddmu-unix-domain.socket
</code></pre>
<h2>
Service
</h2>
<p>
Make sure the directory for the wiki exists and copy the template files:
</p>
<pre><code>mkdir --parents /home/alex/.local/share/oddmu
cp *.html /home/alex/.local/share/oddmu
</code></pre>
<p>
This is the file “oddmu-unix-domain.service”:
</p>
<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Oddmu
After=network.target
Requires=oddmu-unix-domain.socket
[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
StandardInput=socket
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal
ExecStart=/home/alex/src/oddmu/oddmu
WorkingDirectory=/home/alex/.local/share/oddmu
Environment=&quot;ODDMU_WEBFINGER=1&quot;
Environment=&quot;ODDMU_LANGUAGES=de,en&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>
This doesn’t limit a lot of capabilities, but I guess I trust my own
code.
</p>
<p>
Install it:
</p>
<pre><code>systemctl --user enable ./oddmu-unix-domain.service
systemctl --user start oddmu-unix-domain.service
</code></pre>
<h2>
Test
</h2>
<p>
Check the journal:
</p>
<pre><code>journalctl --user --follow --unit oddmu-unix-domain
</code></pre>
<p>
Do some requests using netcat:
</p>
<pre><code>echo -e &quot;GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\n\r\n&quot; \
  | ncat --unixsock ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock
echo -e &quot;GET /view/index HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\n\r\n&quot; \
  | ncat --unixsock ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock
echo -e &quot;GET /edit/index HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\n\r\n&quot; \
  | ncat --unixsock ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock
</code></pre>
<p>
Using curl:
</p>
<pre><code>curl --unix-socket ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock \
  http://localhost/edit/index
curl --unix-socket ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock \
  --form body=&quot;Hello!&quot; http://localhost/save/index
curl --unix-socket ~/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock \
  http://localhost/view/index
</code></pre>
<h2>
What now?
</h2>
<p>
I don’t think I’m going to change my web server setup. But using sockets
and <code>systemctl –user</code> has been interesting.
</p>
<p>
Thank you, Chris Brannon, for sending that patch!
</p>
<h2>
Apache
</h2>
<p>
If you’re installing Apache for the first time, on Debian:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install apache2
sudo a2enmod proxy proxy_http
</code></pre>
<p>
Create a file “/etc/apache2/sites-available/oddmu.conf”:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerName localhost
    ProxyPassMatch &quot;^/((view|diff|edit|save|add|append|upload|drop|search)/(.*))?$&quot; \
      &quot;unix:/home/alex/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock|http://localhost/$1&quot;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
Restart Apache to load the module configuration and the site
configuration.
</p>
<pre><code>sudo a2ensite oddmu
sudo systemctl restart 
</code></pre>
<p>
Test it:
</p>
<pre><code>curl http://localhost/view/index
</code></pre>
<p>
There’s a curious problem with this expression, however. If you use
<em>curl(1)</em> to get the root path, Apache hangs:
</p>
<pre><code>curl http://transjovian.org/
</code></pre>
<p>
A workaround is to add the redirect manually and drop the question-mark:
</p>
<pre><code>RedirectMatch &quot;^/$&quot; &quot;/view/index&quot;
ProxyPassMatch &quot;^/((view|diff|edit|save|add|append|upload|drop|search)/(.*))$&quot; \
      &quot;unix:/home/alex/.local/run/oddmu/oddmu.sock|http://localhost/$1&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>
New release
</h2>
<p>
Yeah, I think this Unix domain socket stuff is cool enough to warrant a
release. I migrated my three sites over to this setup. No more weird
ports.

Android emulators, iOS simulators, and other product updates from
Project IDX</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>Six months ago, we launched Project IDX, an experimental, cloud-based
workspace for full-stack, multiplatform software development. We built
Project IDX to simplify and streamline the developer workflow, aiming to
reduce the sea of complexities traditionally associated with app
development. It certainly seems like we’ve piqued your interest, and we
love seeing what IDX has helped you build. We’re bringing the iOS
Simulator and Android Emulator to the browser. Whether you’re building a
Flutter or web app, Project IDX now allows you to preview your
applications without having to leave your workspace. When you use a
Flutter or web template, Project IDX intelligently loads the right
preview environment for your application — Safari mobile and Chrome for
web templates, or Android, iOS, and Chrome for Flutter templates. ↫
Google’s IDX team I’ve seen some articles state that this makes it
possible to develop for iOS without a Mac, but this isn’t really true –
as far as I know, you must have a Mac to submit anything to the App
Store or Testflight, so while you can write and test code using IDX, you
can’t actually deploy is in any meaningful way without getting a
Mac.</p>

id="ending-covid-era-program-may-help-congress-expand-child-tax-credit">Ending
COVID-Era Program May Help Congress Expand Child Tax Credit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — When the U.S. Internal Revenue Service Commissioner
Danny Werfel met privately with senators recently, the chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee asked for his assessment of a startling report:
A whistleblower estimated that 95% of claims now being made by
businesses for a COVID-era tax break were fraudulent.</p>
<p>“He looked at his shoes and he basically said, ‘Yeah,’” recalled the
lawmaker who posed that question, Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from
Oregon.</p>
<p>The answer explains why Congress is racing to wind down what is known
as the employee retention tax credit. Congress established the program
during the coronavirus pandemic as an incentive for businesses to keep
workers on the payroll.</p>
<p>Demand for the credit soared as Congress extended the tax break and
made it available to more companies. Aggressive marketers dangled the
prospect of enormous refunds to business owners if they would just
apply. As a result, what was expected to cost the federal government $55
billion has instead ballooned to nearly five times that amount as of
July. Meanwhile, new claims are still pouring into the IRS each week,
ensuring a growing price tag that lawmakers are anxious to cap.</p>
<p>Lawmakers across the political spectrum who rarely agree on little
else — from liberal Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to
conservative Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin — agree it’s time to close
the program.</p>
<p>“I don’t have the exact number, but it’s like almost universal fraud
in the program. It should be ended,” Johnson said. “I don’t see how
anybody could support it.”</p>
<p>Warren added: “The standards were too loose, and the oversight was
too thin.”</p>
<p>The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that winding down the
program more quickly and increasing penalties for those companies
promoting improper claims would generate about $79 billion over 10
years.</p>
<p>Lawmakers aim to use the savings to offset the cost of three business
tax breaks and a more generous child tax credit for many low-income
families. Households benefiting from the changes in the child tax credit
would see an average tax cut of $680 in the first year, according to an
estimate from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.</p>
<p>The package was overwhelmingly approved by a House committee last
week, 40-3, showing it has broad, bipartisan support.</p>
<p>But passage through Congress is not assured because many key senators
have concerns about aspects of the bill. Wyden said a strong vote in the
House could spur the Senate into quicker action. Still, passing major
legislation in an election year is generally a heavy lift.</p>
<p>Under current law, taxpayers have until April 15, 2025, to claim the
employee retention credit. The bill would bar new claims after January
31 of this year. It also would impose stiff penalties on those who are
promoting the employer retention tax credit if they know or have reason
to know their advice will lead to an underreporting of tax
liabilities.</p>
<p>When Congress created the tax break for employers at the pandemic’s
onset, it proved so popular that lawmakers extended and amended the
program three times. The credit, worth up to $26,000 per employee, can
be claimed on wages paid through 2021.</p>
<p>To qualify, generally businesses must show that a local or state
government order related to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in their
business having to close or partially suspend operations. Or the
businesses must show they experienced a significant decline in
revenue.</p>
<p>Larry Gray, a certified public accountant from Rolla, Missouri, said
he had concerns early on about how the program could be abused.</p>
<p>“There was no documentation really to speak,” and the IRS just sent
out the checks, Gray said. “They just started printing the checks, and I
believe Congress was wanting them to print the checks.”</p>
<p>His hunch has proven correct, judging by the filings that he has
reviewed. He has even lost clients who didn’t want to hear that they did
not qualify when others were telling them they did. Generally, he said,
the businesses that don’t qualify are failing to cite the government
order that resulted in their closure or partial suspension.</p>
<p>They are also routinely citing reasons for reimbursement that don’t
meet the program’s criteria. For example, one company said it was
struggling to find employees and had to raise wages as a justification
for qualifying.</p>
<p>“If I go through the narratives on the filings that I’m looking at,
every business in America qualifies,” Gray said.</p>
<p>The IRS paused accepting claims for the tax credit in September last
year until 2024 due to rising concerns that an influx of fraudulent
applications. At that point, it had received 3.6 million claims.</p>
<p>Some fraud has been prolific. For instance, a New Jersey tax preparer
was arrested in July on charges related to fraudulently seeking over
$124 million from the IRS when he filed more than 1,000 tax returns
claiming the employment tax credits.</p>
<p>In an update issued Thursday about the program, the IRS said that it
has thousands of audits in the pipeline and that as of Dec. 31, it has
initiated 352 criminal investigations involving more than $2.9 billion
in potentially fraudulent claims. Separately, it has opened nine civil
investigations of marketers that potentially misled employers on
eligibility to file claims.</p>

id="iraq-us-in-talks-to-end-coalition-mission-targeting-islamic-state">Iraq,
US in Talks to End Coalition Mission Targeting Islamic State</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIRUT — The United States and Iraq held a first session of formal
talks Saturday in Baghdad aimed at winding down the mission of a
U.S.-led military coalition formed to fight the Islamic State group in
Iraq.</p>
<p>Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said in a statement that
he had sponsored “the commencement of the first round of bilateral
dialogue between Iraq and the United States of America to end the
mission of the Coalition in Iraq.”</p>
<p>The beginning of talks, announced by both countries Thursday, comes
as U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria have been regularly targeted by drone
attacks launched by Iran-backed militias against the backdrop of the
ongoing Israel-Hamas war.</p>
<p>The U.S. says plans to set up a committee to negotiate the terms of
the mission’s end were first discussed last year, and the timing isn’t
related to the attacks.</p>
<p>Washington has had a continuous presence in Iraq since its 2003
invasion. Although all U.S. combat forces left in 2011, thousands of
troops returned in 2014 to help the government of Iraq defeat the
Islamic State.</p>
<p>Since the extremist group lost its hold on the territory it once
seized, Iraqi officials have periodically called for a withdrawal of
coalition forces, particularly in the wake of a U.S. airstrike in
January 2020 that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi
militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis outside the Baghdad airport.</p>
<p>The issue has surfaced again since Israel launched its major
counteroffensive in Gaza following the October 7 Hamas-led terror attack
in southern Israel.</p>
<p>Since mid-October, a group of Iran-backed militias calling itself the
Islamic Resistance in Iraq have launched regular attacks on U.S. forces
in Iraq and Syria, which the group said are in retaliation for
Washington’s support for Israel in the war in Gaza.</p>
<p>Those estimated 2,500 U.S. troops and the bases they serve on have
drawn more than 150 missile and drone attacks fired by the militias.
Scores of U.S. personnel have been wounded, including some with
traumatic brain injuries, during the attacks.</p>
<p>The U.S. has struck militia targets in return, including some linked
to the Popular Mobilization Forces, a coalition of mainly Shiite,
Iran-backed paramilitary groups that is officially under the control of
the Iraqi military. But it largely operates on its own in practice.
Iraqi officials have complained that the U.S. strikes are a violation of
Iraq’s sovereignty.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have said that talks about setting up a committee to
decide on the framework for ending the coalition’s mission were already
underway before October 7 and that the decision is unrelated to the
attacks.</p>
<p>The Islamic Resistance in Iraq nevertheless took credit for the
decision in a statement, saying that it “proves that the Americans only
understand the language of force.” It vowed to continue its attacks.</p>

Solar is a market for (financial) lemons (27 Jan 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-27, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Solar is a market for (financial) lemons: Our Slow AIs
have an alignment problem. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This
day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019 Colophon: Recent publications,
upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading
Solar is a market for (financial) lemons (permalink) Rooftop solar is
the future, but it’s also a scam. It didn’t have to be, but America
decided that the best way to roll out distributed, resilient, clean and
renewable energy was to let Wall Street run the show. They turned it
into a scam, and now it’s in terrible trouble. which means we are in
terrible trouble. There’s a (superficial) good case for turning markets
loose on the problem of financing the rollout of an entirely new kind of
energy provision across a large and heterogeneous nation. As
capitalism’s champions (and apologists) have observed since the days of
Adam Smith and David Ricardo, markets harness together the work of
thousands or even millions of strangers in pursuit of a common goal,
without all those people having to agree on a single approach or plan of
action. Merely dangle the incentive of profit before the market’s
teeming participants and they will align themselves towards it, like
iron filings all snapping into formation towards a magnet. But markets
have a problem: they are prone to “reward hacking.” This is a term from
AI research: tell your AI that you want it to do something, and it will
find the fastest and most efficient way of doing it, even if that method
is one that actually destroys the reason you were pursuing the goal in
the first place.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/engineering/failure-modes-in-machine-learning
For example: if you use an AI to come up with a Roomba that doesn’t bang
into furniture, you might tell that Roomba to avoid collisions. However,
the Roomba is only designed to register collisions with its front-facing
sensor. Turn the Roomba loose and it will quickly hit on the tactic of
racing around the room in reverse, banging into all your furniture
repeatedly, while never registering a single collision:
https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2021/04/when-ais-start-hacking.html
This is sometimes called the “alignment problem.” High-speed,
probabilistic systems that can’t be fully predicted in advance can very
quickly run off the rails. It’s an idea that pre-dates AI, of course –
think of the Sorcerer’s Apprentice. But AI produces these perverse
outcomes at scale…and so does capitalism. Many sf writers have observed
the odd phenomenon of corporate AI executives spinning bad sci-fi
scenarios about their AIs inadvertently destroying the human race by
spinning off in some kind of paperclip-maximizing reward-hack that
reduces the whole planet to grey goo in order to make more paperclips.
This idea is very implausible (to say the least), but the fact that so
many corporate leaders are obsessed with autonomous systems
reward-hacking their way into catastrophe tells us something about
corporate executives, even if it has no predictive value for
understanding the future of technology. Both Ted Chiang and Charlie
Stross have theorized that the source of these anxieties isn’t AI – it’s
corporations. Corporations are these equilibrium-seeking complex
machines that can’t be programmed, only prompted. CEOs know that they
don’t actually run their companies, and it haunts them, because while
they can decompose a company into all its constituent elements –
capital, labor, procedures – they can’t get this model-train set to go
around the loop:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/09/autocomplete-worshippers/#the-real-ai-was-the-corporations-that-we-fought-along-the-way
Stross calls corporations “Slow AI,” a pernicious artificial life-form
that acts like a pedantic genie, always on the hunt for ways to destroy
you while still strictly following your directions. Markets are an
extremely reliable way to find the most awful alignment problems – but
by the time they’ve surfaced them, they’ve also destroyed the thing you
were hoping to improve with your market mechanism. Which brings me back
to solar, as practiced in America. In a long Time feature, Alana Semuels
describes the waves of bankruptcies, revealed frauds, and even
confiscation of homeowners’ houses arising from a decade of
financialized solar:
https://time.com/6565415/rooftop-solar-industry-collapse/ The problem
starts with a pretty common finance puzzle: solar pays off big over its
lifespan, saving the homeowner money and insulating them from
price-shocks, emergency power outages, and other horrors. But solar
requires a large upfront investment, which many homeowners can’t afford
to make. To resolve this, the finance industry extends credit to
homeowners (lets them borrow money) and gets paid back out of the
savings the homeowner realizes over the years to come. But of course,
this requires a lot of capital, and homeowners still might not see the
wisdom of paying even some of the price of solar and taking on debt for
a benefit they won’t even realize until the whole debt is paid off. So
the government moved in to tinker with the markets, injecting prompts
into the slow AIs to see if it could coax the system into producing a
faster solar rollout – say, one that didn’t have to rely on waves of
deadly power-outages during storms, heatwaves, fires, etc, to convince
homeowners to get on board because they’d have experienced the pain of
sitting through those disasters in the dark. The government created
subsidies – tax credits, direct cash, and mixes thereof – in the
expectation that Wall Street would see all these credits and subsidies
that everyday people were entitled to and go on the hunt for them. And
they did! Armies of fast-talking sales-reps fanned out across America,
ringing dooorbells and sticking fliers in mailboxes, and lying like hell
about how your new solar roof was gonna work out for you. These hustlers
tricked old and vulnerable people into signing up for arrangements that
saw them saddled with ballooning debt payments (after a honeymoon period
at a super-low teaser rate), backstopped by liens on their houses, which
meant that missing a payment could mean losing your home. They
underprovisioned the solar that they installed, leaving homeowners with
sky-high electrical bills on top of those debt payments. If this sounds
familiar, it’s because it shares a lot of DNA with the subprime housing
bubble, where fast-talking salesmen conned vulnerable people into taking
out predatory mortgages with sky-high rates that kicked in after a
honeymoon period, promising buyers that the rising value of housing
would offset any losses from that high rate. These fraudsters knew they
were acquiring toxic assets, but it didn’t matter, because they were
bundling up those assets into “collateralized debt obligations” – exotic
black-box “derivatives” that could be sold onto pension funds, retail
investors, and other suckers. This is likewise true of solar, where the
tax-credits, subsidies and other income streams that these new solar
installations offgassed were captured and turned into bonds that were
sold into the financial markets, producing an insatiable demand for more
rooftop solar installations, and that meant lots more fraud. Which
brings us to today, where homeowners across America are waking up to
discover that their power bills have gone up thanks to their solar
arrays, even as the giant, financialized solar firms that supplied them
are teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, thanks to waves of defaults.
Meanwhile, all those bonds that were created from solar installations
are ticking timebombs, sitting on institutions’ balance-sheets, waiting
to go blooie once the defaults cross some unpredictable threshold.
Markets are very efficient at mobilizing capital for growth
opportunities. America has a lot of rooftop solar. But 70% of that solar
isn’t owned by the homeowner – it’s owned by a solar company, which is
to say, “a finance company that happens to sell solar”:
https://www.utilitydive.com/news/solarcity-maintains-34-residential-solar-market-share-in-1h-2015/406552/
And markets are very efficient at reward hacking. The point of any
market is to multiply capital. If the only way to multiply the capital
is through building solar, then you get solar. But the finance sector
specializes in making the capital multiply as much as possible while
doing as little as possible on the solar front. Huge chunks of those
federal subsidies were gobbled up by junk-fees and other financial
tricks – sometimes more than 100%. The solar companies would be in even
worse trouble, but they also tricked all their victims into signing
binding arbitration waivers that deny them the power to sue and force
them to have their grievances heard by fake judges who are paid by the
solar companies to decide whether the solar companies have done anything
wrong. You will not be surprised to learn that the arbitrators are
reluctant to find against their paymasters. I had a sense that all this
was going on even before I read Semuels’ excellent article. We bought a
solar installation from Treeium, a highly rated, giant Southern
California solar installer. We got an incredibly hard sell from them to
get our solar “for free” – that is, through these financial arrangements
– but I’d just sold a book and I had cash on hand and I was adamant that
we were just going to pay upfront. As soon as that was clear, Treeium’s
ardor palpably cooled. We ended up with a grossly defective, unsafe and
underpowered solar installation that has cost more than $10,000 to bring
into a functional state (using another vendor). I briefly considered
suing Treeium (I had insisted on striking the binding arbitration waiver
from the contract) but in the end, I decided life was too short. The
thing is, solar is amazing. We love running our house on sunshine. But
markets have proven – again and again – to be an unreliable and even
dangerous way to improve Americans’ homes and make them more resilient.
After all, Americans’ homes are the largest asset they are apt to own,
which makes them irresistible targets for scammers:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/06/the-rents-too-damned-high/ That’s why
the subprime scammers targets Americans’ homes in the 2000s, and it’s
why the house-stealing fraudsters who blanket the country in “We Buy
Ugly Homes” are targeting them now. Same reason Willie Sutton robbed
banks: “That’s where the money is”:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/11/ugly-houses-ugly-truth/ America can
and should electrify and solarize. There are serious logistical
challenges related to sourcing the underlying materials and deploying
the labor, but those challenges are grossly overrated by people who
assume the only way we can approach them is though markets, those
monkey’s paw curses that always find a way to snatch profitable defeat
from the jaws of useful victory. To get a sense of how the engineering
challenges of electrification could be met, read McArthur fellow Saul
Griffith’s excellent popular engineering text Electrify:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/12/09/practical-visionary/#popular-engineering
And to really understand the transformative power of solar, don’t miss
Deb Chachra’s How Infrastructure Works, where you’ll learn that we could
give every person on Earth the energy budget of a Canadian (like an
American, but colder) by capturing just 0.4% of the solar rays that
reach Earth’s surface:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/17/care-work/#charismatic-megaprojects
But we won’t get there with markets. All markets will do is create
incentives to cheat. Think of the market for “carbon offsets,” which
were supposed to substitute markets for direct regulation, and which
produced a fraud-riddled market for lemons that sells indulgences to our
worst polluters, who go on destroying our planet and our future:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/14/for-sale-green-indulgences/#killer-analogy
We can address the climate emergency, but not by prompting the slow AI
and hoping it doesn’t figure out a way to reward-hack its way to giant
profits while doing nothing. Founder and chairman of Goodleap, Hayes
Barnard, is one of the 400 richest people in the world – a fortune built
on scammers who tricked old people into signing away their homes for
nonfunctional solar):
https://www.forbes.com/profile/hayes-barnard/?sh=40d596362b28 If
governments are willing to spend billions incentivizing rooftop solar,
they can simply spend billions installing rooftop solar – no Slow AI
required. (Image: Future Atlas/http://www.futureatlas.com/blog, CC BY

businesses we depend on by and large are pretty awful people. Also I go
to NYC even though there are Nazis there (esp Queens and Staten Island).
And Twitter has far more users than NYC has citizens. That gives you a
sense of how foolish this idea of boycotting Twitter is. And one more

<p>One of the rules of
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a> is that the writer
must be able to edit their posts. An almost universal response is the
way Twitter used to explain their not having editable posts – then
people who commented might have said something that seems foolish. I
have a couple of rebuttals to that. 1. Then don’t comment on what the
author said, instead write what you know or believe, so it would make
sense even if the author changed their post. This is a good practice
anyway, instead of saying people are wrong, just state your belief. It’s
a lot easier for people to listen to, and by the way the other person
might be right. 2. A counter-example – Facebook. They let authors edit
their posts and comments. And somehow it keeps working more or less.
Their software does add a note that the text has been edited, and I
think they even have a way for you to see the changes, but who bothers.
Comments are usually simple “you go girl” or “my brother” or “I’m
great!” or “check out my site.”</p>

<h2 id="growing-our-team-and-maybe-this-blog">Growing our team (and
maybe this blog?)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-27, from: Matthew Lincoln Blog</p>
<p>
<a href="/2022/01/11/cmu-digicol-and-neh">Around this time two years
ago</a>, I noted that the changing nature of my work was slowing my rate
of new blog posts. So many of my previous posts have been publicizing
individual things I had done - an important aspect of my career in my
former life as an academic. As projects grew bigger and more complex,
and communication about them more complex (and wrapped up with other
project stakeholders, with marketing departments, and the like), I just
didn’t have the same kinds of milestones that made sense for individual
bloggage.
</p>
<p>
That work is going to change even more in this coming year as I take up
the helm of the manager of engineering for JSTOR Labs.
</p>
<p>
JSTOR Labs has nearly doubled the size of its engineering team since I
joined in 2022. We have been growing in response to our changing mandate
within the organization. We don’t just experiment with technologies,
now, but entire product/business models. This means our development
standards have risen a lot. End users want more external finish for our
maturing products like
<a href="https://constellate.org">Constellate</a>. But we also have
increasing internal expectations around observability, reliability,
security, and deployment processes.
</p>
<p>
I’m looking forward to the challenge of balancing these priorities
against Labs’ need to remain a highly experimental and risk-taking part
of the larger organization. We’ll definitely be thinking about how to
steward our
<a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">innovation
tokens</a> on the unique domain problems we’re working on. It’s an
ambitious year for our team as we seek to build out a few headline
programs towards financial sustainability, so the work will also be a
lot about careful product choices as well as careful technological
choices.
</p>
<p>
I’m also going to endeavor to write a bit more about the experience this
year. I’m not really sure how that will go! I find it hard enough to
write on my personal blog about the work I have done on larger team
projects. While I’ll still be doing a decent amount of individual
contributor work, obviously more of my days will now be about building
and growing our engineering team, championing the awesome work of others
rather than tooting my own horn. This has been a great organization to
work in as an academic-turned-developer - a lot of us come from
non-traditional-software backgrounds and Labs has been such a close-knit
and fun group to work with. To that end, keep an eye on
<a href="https://www.ithaka.org/careers/">ITHAKA’s career’s page</a>
(and here, too), because we’ll be recruiting soon!

<h2 id="us-navy-again-lowers-requirements-to-meet-recruitment-goals">US
Navy Again Lowers Requirements to Meet Recruitment Goals</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Navy is starting to enlist individuals who
didn’t graduate from high school or get a GED, marking the second time
in about a year that the service has opened the door to lower-performing
recruits as it struggles to meet enlistment goals.</p>
<p>The decision follows a move in December 2022 to bring in a larger
number of recruits who score very low on the Armed Services
Qualification Test. Both are fairly rare steps that the other military
services largely avoid or limit, even though they are all finding it
increasingly difficult to attract the dwindling number of young people
who can meet the military’s physical, mental and moral standards.</p>
<p>Under the new plan, Navy recruits without an education credential
will be able to join as long as they score 50 or above on the
qualification test, which is out of 99. The last time the service took
individuals without education credentials was in 2000.</p>
<p>“We get thousands of people into our recruiting stations every year
that want to join the Navy but do not have an education credential. And
we just turn them away,” said Vice Admiral Rick Cheeseman, the Navy’s
chief of personnel, in an interview Friday with The Associated
Press.</p>
<p>He said that of the more than 2,400 who were turned away last year,
as many as 500 of them could score high enough to get in. He said he has
already sent an order to his recruiters to start the new expanded
effort, adding, “I’m hoping all my recruiters have called all 2,442 of
them in the last 72 hours, and we’ll see how it goes. … We’ll try to get
some test takers this weekend.”</p>
<p>In the wake of the pandemic, the services have faced significant
enlistment challenges. COVID-19 forced the military to shut down
recruiting stations, and they were closed out of high schools and many
public events where they historically found success reaching prospective
candidates.</p>
<p>But even as things opened up, the military struggled to compete with
higher-paying businesses in the tight job market, particularly as
companies began to offer the types of benefits — such as college funding
— that had often made the military a popular choice. Those economic
problems were only exacerbated by the sharp political divide in the
country and young people’s fears of being killed or injured going to
war.</p>
<p>Last fiscal year, which ended September 30, the Navy, Army and Air
Force all failed to meet their recruitment goals, while the Marine Corps
and the tiny Space Force met their targets. The previous fiscal year,
the Army fell 15,000 short of its enlistment goal of 60,000, and the
other services had to dig into the pools of delayed entry candidates in
order to meet their recruiting numbers.</p>
<p>Last year, the Navy’s enlistment goal was 37,700, but the service
brought in just 31,834. This year, Cheeseman said, he set the goal
higher — at 40,600. The total size of the Navy for 2024 is set at
337,800.</p>
<p>“I need these sailors. So it’s a stretch goal. We’re telling our
recruiters to go get 40,600 people to join the Navy,” he said. “We don’t
fully expect to get that many. But we’re going for it.”</p>
<p>The other services have largely balked at such changes.</p>
<p>The Navy is the only service that enlists anyone considered a
“category four” recruit, meaning they scored 30 or less on the
qualification test. The service expanded the number of those
category-four recruits arguing that a number of jobs — such as cook or
boatswain mate — don’t require an overall high test score, as long as
they meet the job standards.</p>
<p>The Army will only take those lowest scoring candidates into their
so-called Future Soldier Prep Course, which gives them weeks of
instruction and the opportunity to increase their score in order to make
the grade and enlist. The Navy allows low-scoring recruits to go through
its Future Sailor Prep Course but doesn’t require an increased score to
enlist.</p>
<p>In addition, the Army and Marine Corps require a high school diploma
or GED equivalent, and the Air Force said it will only take recruits
without a diploma if they score a 65 or higher on the qualification
test. Those numbers are very small — just 110 of the nearly 26,900 Air
Force recruits brought in last year, either had a GED or no education
credential at all.</p>
<p>Other services cite concerns that lower-performing recruits may be
more likely to wash out of boot camp or could present more disciplinary
problems over time.</p>
<p>Cheeseman said he believes the biggest risk is that they do fail boot
camp at higher rates, but he said the difference hasn’t been significant
so far for the low-scoring recruits brought in last year. Overall, 11.4%
of those recruits didn’t finish boot camp, compared with less than 6.5%
of the high-scoring sailors.</p>
<p>He said Navy leaders had been talking about opening up enlistment to
those without high school credentials for a while in an effort to expand
the pool of potential sailors.</p>
<p>“We just finally decided, OK, let’s go,” he said, adding that the
service was looking for other ways to reach untapped talent. “My,
argument for accepting that risk is that we have capacity of boot camp.
We’re not filling the seats. So I’m willing to take a risk.”</p>

Speaker Suggests Border Bill May Be ‘Dead on Arrival’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday pressed Congress to
embrace a bipartisan Senate deal to pair border enforcement measures
with Ukraine aid, but House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson
suggested the compromise on border and immigration policy could be “dead
on arrival” in his chamber.</p>
<p>The Democratic president said in a statement late Friday that the
policies proposed would “be the toughest and fairest set of reforms to
secure the border we’ve ever had in our country.” He also pledged to use
a new emergency authority to “shut down the border” as soon as he could
sign it into law.</p>
<p>Biden’s embrace of the deal — and Republican resistance — could
become an election-year shift on the politics of immigration. Yet the
diminishing prospects for its passage in Congress may have far-reaching
consequences for U.S. allies around the globe, especially Ukraine.</p>
<p>Senate Republicans had initially insisted that border policy changes
be included in Biden’s $110 billion emergency request for funding for
Ukraine, Israel, immigration enforcement and other national security
needs. But the Senate deal faced collapse this week as it came under
fire from Republicans, including Donald Trump, the likely presidential
nominee, who eviscerated the deal as a political “gift” to
Democrats.</p>
<p>Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, on Friday sent a letter to
colleagues that aligns him with hardline conservatives determined to
sink the compromise. The speaker said the legislation would have been
“dead on arrival in the House” if leaked reports about it were true.</p>
<p>A core group of senators negotiating the deal were hoping to release
text early next week, but conservatives already say the measures do not
go far enough to limit immigration. The proposal would enact tougher
standards on migrants seeking asylum as well as deny asylum applications
at the border if daily migrant encounters grow to numbers that are
unmanageable for authorities.</p>
<p>The speaker’s message added to the headwinds facing the Senate deal,
closing a week in which Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell
acknowledged to his colleagues that the legislation faced tough
opposition from Trump that could force them to pursue Ukraine aid
another way. He later clarified that he was still supportive of pairing
border measures with Ukraine aid.</p>
<p>If the deal collapses, it could leave congressional leaders with no
clear path to approving tens of billions of dollars for Ukraine. Biden
has made it a top priority to bolster Kyiv’s defense against Russia, but
his administration has run out of money to send ammunition and missiles.
Ukraine supporters warn that the impasse in Congress is being felt on
battlefields and leaving Ukrainian soldiers outgunned.</p>
<p>Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, the lead GOP negotiator in the border
talks, has repeatedly urged lawmakers to refrain from passing final
judgment on the bill until they receive legislative text and said some
of the reports of its contents in conservative media are not accurate
depictions of the bill.</p>
<p>The Republican speaker was deeply skeptical of any bipartisan
compromise on border policy. On Friday, he again pointed to a sweeping
set of immigration measures that the House passed last year as being the
answer to the nation’s border challenges. But that bill failed to gain a
single Democratic vote then and has virtually no chance of picking up
Democratic support now, which would be necessary to clear the
Senate.</p>
<p>As they enter an election year, Republicans are seeking to drive home
the fact that historic numbers of migrants have come to the U.S. during
Biden’s presidency. His administration has countered that global unrest
is driving the migration and has sought to implement humane policies on
border enforcement.</p>
<p>“Securing the border through these negotiations is a win for
America,” Biden said in the statement. “For everyone who is demanding
tougher border control, this is the way to do it.”</p>

Hikes Military Pressure on Taiwan After US, China Announce Talks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TAIPEI, Taiwan — China sent more than 30 warplanes and a group of
navy ships toward Taiwan, the island’s defense ministry said
Saturday.</p>
<p>The military pressure comes on the heels of an announcement that
senior American and Chinese representatives were expected to meet in the
Thai capital as the two countries seek to cool tensions.</p>
<p>The Chinese People’s Liberation Army sent 33 aircraft, including
SU-30 fighters, and six navy vessels around Taiwan, between 6 a.m.
Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday. Of these, 13 warplanes crossed the midline of
the Taiwan Strait — an unofficial boundary that’s considered a buffer
between the island and mainland. Taiwan has monitored the situation and
employed its own forces in response to the activities.</p>
<p>China claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own territory and in recent
years has shown its displeasure at political activities in Taiwan by
sending military planes and ships. Taiwan said six Chinese balloons
either flew over the island or through airspace just north of it days
after the self-governing island elected Lai Ching-te as the new
president. Lai’s Democratic Progressive Party largely campaigned on
self-determination, social justice and a rejection of China’s
threats.</p>
<p>U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Chinese Foreign
Minister Wang Yi were in Bangkok for talks, although it wasn’t clear
when the meeting would take place or if it already had.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping met on the
sidelines of a summit in November in an effort to patch up frayed
relations due to quarrels over a range of economic and geopolitical
issues. U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said
the planned meeting in Bangkok continues the commitment Biden and Xi
made “to maintain strategic communication and responsibly manage the
relationship.”</p>
<p>During talks, Foreign Minister Wang would make clear China’s position
on Taiwan and on U.S.-China relations, and discuss international and
regional concerns, ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Friday.</p>
<p>An immediate international concern to both countries is tensions in
the Red Sea that have upended global trade by forcing many shippers to
avoid the Suez Canal. Beijing said it has been making positive efforts
to de-escalate the situation in which Iran-backed Houthi rebels have
fired missiles at international ships.</p>

Wait 17 Years for Trial in Bali Bombings, Take US Plea Deal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A military panel at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, recommended 23
years in detention Friday for two Malaysian men in connection with
deadly 2002 bombings in Bali, a spokesperson for the military commission
said.</p>
<p>However, under a previously secret provision of the plea agreement
disclosed after the panel’s recommendation Friday, and a separate
sentence reduction Friday by the presiding judge, both men may face a
far shorter sentence: about five years.</p>
<p>Mohammed Farik Bin Amin and Mohammed Nazir Bin Lep already have spent
about 17 years awaiting trial at Guantanamo.</p>
<p>The winding down of the case against them marks comparatively rare
convictions in the two decades of proceedings by the U.S. military
commission at Guantanamo.</p>
<p>The extremist group Jemaah Islamiyah killed 202 Indonesians, foreign
tourists and others in two nearly simultaneous bombings at nightspots on
the resort island of Bali in October 2002.</p>
<p>The two defendants denied any role or advance knowledge of the
attacks but under the plea bargains admitted they had over the years
conspired with the network of militants responsible. The sentence
recommendation still requires approval by the senior military authority
over Guantanamo.</p>
<p>The two are among a total of 780 detainees brought to military
detention at Guantanamo under the George W. Bush administration’s “war
on terror” following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the U.S. There have
been only a handful of convictions over the years — eight, according to
one advocacy group, Reprieve.</p>
<p>Defendants in some of the biggest attacks, including 9/11, remain in
pretrial hearings. Prosecutors are seeking negotiated agreements to
close that case and some others.</p>
<p>Overall, the prosecutions at Guantanamo have been plagued by
logistical difficulties, frequent turnover of judges and others, and
legal questions surrounding the torture of detainees during CIA custody
in the first years of their detention.</p>
<p>The military’s head of defense for the Guantanamo prosecutions on
Friday blamed the Bush administration’s early handling of the detainees
— which included holding at secret “black sites” and torture in CIA
custody — for the more than 20-year delay in the trial.</p>
<p>The slow pace “was extremely distressing and frustrated the desire of
everyone for accountability and justice,” Brig. Gen. Jackie Thompson
said in a statement.</p>
<p>Thirty detainees remain at Guantanamo. Sixteen of them have been
cleared and are eligible for transfer if a stable country agrees to take
them.</p>
<p>“The time for repatriating or transferring the cleared men is now,”
Thompson said. He said the same for three others held at Guantanamo but
never charged.</p>
<p>As part of their plea bargains, the two Malaysian men have agreed to
provide testimony against a third Guantanamo detainee, an Indonesian man
known as Hambali, in the Bali bombings.</p>
<p>Under military court rules, Bin Amin and Bin Lep normally would
receive no credit for the roughly two decades they have already spent in
detention. The pretrial agreement disclosed Friday would spare them from
serving the much longer recommended sentence on top of their years
awaiting trial, the defense lawyers for the two men said.</p>
<p>Relatives of some of those killed in the Bali bombings testified
Wednesday in a hearing in advance of sentencing, with the two accused in
the courtroom and listening attentively.</p>
<p>A panel of five military officers delivered the recommendation after
listening to the sentencing testimony.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Malaysia may agree to transferring the two to their home
country, said Brian Bouffard, the attorney for Bin Lep.</p>

id="deepfake-explicit-images-of-taylor-swift-spread-on-social-media">Deepfake
Explicit Images of Taylor Swift Spread on Social Media</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Pornographic deepfake images of Taylor Swift are
circulating online, making the singer the most famous victim of a
scourge that tech platforms and anti-abuse groups have struggled to
fix.</p>
<p>Sexually explicit and abusive fake images of Swift began circulating
widely this week on the social media platform X.</p>
<p>Her ardent fanbase of “Swifties” quickly mobilized, launching a
counteroffensive on the platform formerly known as Twitter and a
#ProtectTaylorSwift hashtag to flood it with more positive images of the
pop star. Some said they were reporting accounts that were sharing the
deepfakes.</p>
<p>The deepfake-detecting group Reality Defender said it tracked a
deluge of nonconsensual pornographic material depicting Swift,
particularly on X. Some images also made their way to Meta-owned
Facebook and other social media platforms.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, they spread to millions and millions of users by the
time that some of them were taken down,” said Mason Allen, Reality
Defender’s head of growth.</p>
<p>The researchers found at least a couple dozen unique AI-generated
images. The most widely shared were football-related, showing a painted
or bloodied Swift that objectified her and in some cases inflicted
violent harm on her deepfake persona.</p>
<p>Researchers have said the number of explicit deepfakes has grown in
the past few years, as the technology used to produce such images has
become more accessible and easier to use. In 2019, a report released by
the AI firm DeepTrace Labs showed these images were overwhelmingly
weaponized against women. Most of the victims, it said, were Hollywood
actors and South Korean K-pop singers.</p>
<p>Brittany Spanos, a senior writer at Rolling Stone who teaches a
course on Swift at New York University, says Swift’s fans are quick to
mobilize in support of their artist, especially those who take their
fandom very seriously and in situations of wrongdoing.</p>
<p>“This could be a huge deal if she really does pursue it to court,”
she said.</p>
<p>Spanos says the deep fake pornography issue aligns with others Swift
has had in the past, pointing to her 2017 lawsuit against a radio
station DJ who allegedly groped her; jurors awarded Swift $1 in damages,
a sum her attorney, Douglas Baldridge, called “a single symbolic dollar,
the value of which is immeasurable to all women in this situation” in
the midst of the MeToo movement. (The $1 lawsuit became a trend
thereafter, like in Gwyneth Paltrow’s 2023 countersuit against a
skier.)</p>
<p>When reached for comment on the fake images of Swift, X directed the
The Associated Press to a post from its safety account that said the
company strictly prohibits the sharing of non-consensual nude images on
its platform. The company has also sharply cut back its
content-moderation teams since Elon Musk took over the platform in
2022.</p>
<p>“Our teams are actively removing all identified images and taking
appropriate actions against the accounts responsible for posting them,”
the company wrote in the X post early Friday morning. “We’re closely
monitoring the situation to ensure that any further violations are
immediately addressed, and the content is removed.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Meta said in a statement that it strongly condemns “the
content that has appeared across different internet services” and has
worked to remove it.</p>
<p>“We continue to monitor our platforms for this violating content and
will take appropriate action as needed,” the company said.</p>
<p>A representative for Swift didn’t immediately respond to a request
for comment Friday.</p>
<p>Allen said the researchers are 90% confident that the images were
created by diffusion models, which are a type of generative artificial
intelligence model that can produce new and photorealistic images from
written prompts. The most widely known are Stable Diffusion, Midjourney
and OpenAI’s DALL-E. Allen’s group didn’t try to determine the
provenance.</p>
<p>OpenAI said it has safeguards in place to limit the generation of
harmful content and “decline requests that ask for a public figure by
name, including Taylor Swift.”</p>
<p>Microsoft, which offers an image-generator based partly on DALL-E,
said Friday it was in the process of investigating whether its tool was
misused. Much like other commercial AI services, it said it doesn’t
allow “adult or non-consensual intimate content, and any repeated
attempts to produce content that goes against our policies may result in
loss of access to the service.”</p>
<p>Asked about the Swift deepfakes on NBC Nightly News, Microsoft CEO
Satya Nadella told host Lester Holt in an interview airing Tuesday that
there’s a lot still to be done in setting AI safeguards and “it behooves
us to move fast on this.”</p>
<p>“Absolutely this is alarming and terrible, and so therefore yes, we
have to act,” Nadella said.</p>
<p>Midjourney, OpenAI and Stable Diffusion-maker Stability AI didn’t
immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Federal lawmakers who’ve introduced bills to put more restrictions or
criminalize deepfake porn indicated the incident shows why the U.S.
needs to implement better protections.</p>
<p>“For years, women have been victims of non-consensual deepfakes, so
what happened to Taylor Swift is more common than most people realize,”
said U.S. Representative Yvette D. Clarke, a Democrat from New York
who’s introduced legislation that would require creators to digitally
watermark deepfake content.</p>
<p>“Generative-AI is helping create better deepfakes at a fraction of
the cost,” Clarke said.</p>
<p>U.S. Representative Joe Morelle, another New York Democrat pushing a
bill that would criminalize sharing deepfake porn online, said what
happened to Swift was disturbing and has become more and more pervasive
across the internet.</p>
<p>“The images may be fake, but their impacts are very real,” Morelle
said in a statement. “Deepfakes are happening every day to women
everywhere in our increasingly digital world, and it’s time to put a
stop to them.”</p>

A three pixel slightly rounded outline offset from the element, it’s
hard to miss. But you will never see it unless you’re using your
keyboard.
</p>
<p>
Focus states are one of the areas of accessibility that are easy to
neglect when you don’t use your keyboard to navigate everyday. I went on
a deep dive fixing some accessibility issues on my site last month and
found all kinds of issues with focus. So I fixed them using
<code>:focus-visible</code>.
</p>
<h2>
ArticleList
</h2>
<p>
The first was my ArticleList component. I use this pattern often but
somehow managed to nuke the focus state from existence. How did I do
such a bad job? Using
<a href="https://codepen.io/davatron5000/pen/abXmoqa">a reduced test
case</a>, I found the culprit…
</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="html">❌ <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;h2&gt;</span>Title goes here<span class="nt">&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</span>
✅ <span class="nt">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Title goes here<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
After years of moving furniture, my HTML5 block links weren’t so blocky
anymore. I (re)learned that you need <code>a { display: block }</code>
on anchors that wrap block-level elements to get focus states. I prefer
focus states that hug the text rather than a full width block outline,
so I refactored the HTML.

<p>
That’s a good representative of my default <code>:focus-visible</code>
in action. Now onto more, funner, focus states.
</p>
<h2>
ProjectCard
</h2>
<p>
On my new Projects page I have little project cards with images that
View Transition to the detail view. The project logos aren’t uniform, so
to reduce the cacophony of colors I use CSS <code>filter</code> to
desaturate the image, lower the opacity, and normalize with a sepia
filter.
</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="nc">.project</span> <span class="nt">img</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="py">view-transition-name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--name</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nc">.project</span> <span class="nd">:hover</span> <span class="nt">img</span><span class="o">,</span>
<span class="nc">.project</span> <span class="nd">:focus-visible</span> <span class="nt">img</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
On mouse <code>:hover</code> I set the image goes to full color. I made
it do the same for <code>:focus-visible</code> and added the beefy
outline as well.
</p>
<video controls preload="metadata" width="1920" height="1080">
<source src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/ProjectCard.mp4">
</video>
<p>
This is great example of where I want <code>:focus-visible</code>
instead of <code>:focus</code>. I wouldn’t want that <code>:focus</code>
state and its outline lingering as part of my view transition on every
click.
</p>
<h2>
StoryCard
</h2>
<p>
My new stories page has some funky focus states as well. Because I’m
using a “sci-fi rectangle” shape for my StoryCard. On
<code>:hover</code> I do nothing but <code>cursor: pointer</code> , so
the <code>:focus-visible</code> state ends up as a bit of an Easter egg
for keyboard users. On <code>:focus-visible</code> the image link
shrinks down and the outline (with one rounded not-so-sci-fi corner)
appears.
</p>
<video controls preload="metadata" width="1920" height="1080">
<source src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/StoryCard.mp4">
</video>
<p>
This is another example where I wouldn’t want those images to shrink
down on <code>:focus</code>, so I’m able to have even bigger and more
obvious focus states with <code>:focus-visible</code>.
</p>
<h2>
My Bookshelf
</h2>
<p>
The last place where I added <code>:focus-visible</code> states was to
my favorite child, my bookshelf. I had managed to break focus states
again, so I was happy to re-add them back.
</p>
<video controls preload="metadata" width="1920" height="1080">
<source src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/BookCard.mp4">

<p>
The image link focus and <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> dropdown focus are
pretty obvious now where they weren’t visible at all before. I made a
choice to differentiate the <code>:checked</code> of my filters based on
keyboard focus as well. Clicking gets you a subtle black outline, while
keyboard input gives you a beautiful blue outline with a hint of
background color. It’s overkill, but it’s my overkill, so I love it.
</p>
<h2>
You could say I’m a fan
</h2>
<p>
I’ve loved <code>:focus-visible</code> ever since I first heard
<a href="https://github.com/alice">Alice Boxhall</a> and
<a href="https://robdodson.me/">Rob Dodson</a> talk about it. I can’t
tell you how often I’ve heard “Can we remove the blue outline in
Safari?” and had to add an <code>outline: 0</code> CSS crime. That
complaint was so prevalent that you have to TURN ON tab focus in Safari
now. I think that’s a mistake but, <em>c’est le web</em>.
</p>
<p>
Good news! We don’t have to commit CSS crimes anymore!
<code>:focus-visible</code> solves the “I want keyboard focus but not
click focus” problem by treating keyboards and pointers separate. For me
it’s an opportunity to enhance experiences for keyboard-only users.
</p>
<p>
I know there’s folks who think we shouldn’t use this new-fangled
pseudo-state, that we should use <code>:focus</code> instead like the
old days. There’s a good argument behind that but in a world where a lot
of (most?) sites disable focus states entirely, this seems like a good
path forward. And sometimes, it might be a better keyboard experience
for users than a little color change on hover
(<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color.html">§1.4.1</a>).
