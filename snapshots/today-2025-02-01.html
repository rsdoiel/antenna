<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: Gtk Developer blog</p>
<p>We just had a GTK hackfest at FOSDEM. A good time for an update on
whats new and exciting in GTK, with an eye towards 4.18. Requirements
You can no longer call gdk_display_get_default() or gdk_display_open()
before gtk_init(). This was causing problems due to incomplete
initialization, so we made it fail with a (hopefully clear) error …

<h2 id="openai-o3-mini-now-available-in-llm">OpenAI o3-mini, now
available in LLM</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, updated: 2025-01-31, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
OpenAI’s <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/">o3-mini is
out today</a>. As with other o-series models it’s a slightly difficult
one to evaluate - we now need to decide if a prompt is best run using
GPT-4o, o1, o3-mini or (if we have access) o1 Pro.
</p>
<p>
Confusing matters further, the benchmarks in
<a href="https://openai.com/index/o3-mini-system-card/">the o3-mini
system card</a> (PDF) aren’t a universal win for o3-mini across all
categories. It generally benchmarks higher than GPT-4o and o1 but not
across everything.
</p>
<p>
The biggest win for o3-mini is on the Codeforces ELO competitive
programming benchmark, which I think is
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01257">described by this 2nd January
2025 paper</a>, with the following scores:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
o3-mini (high) 2130
</li>
<li>
o3-mini (medium) 2036
</li>
<li>
o1 1891
</li>
<li>
o3-mini (low) 1831
</li>
<li>
o1-mini 1650
</li>
<li>
o1-preview 1258
</li>
<li>
GPT-4o 900
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Weirdly, that GPT-4o score was in an older copy of the System Card PDF
which has been replaced by an updated document that doesn’t mention
Codeforces ELO scores at all.
</p>
<p>
One note from the System Card that stood out for me concerning intended
applications of o3-mini for OpenAI themselves:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We also plan to allow users to use o3-mini to search the internet and
summarize the results in ChatGPT. We expect o3-mini to be a useful and
safe model for doing this, especially given its performance on the
jailbreak and instruction hierarchy evals detailed in Section 4 below.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is notable because the existing o1 models on ChatGPT have not yet
had access to their web search tool - despite the mixture of search and
“reasoning” models having very clear benefits.
</p>
<p>
o3-mini does not and
<a href="https://twitter.com/nikunjhanda/status/1885415728624656481">will
not</a> support vision. We will have to wait for future OpenAI reasoning
models for that.
</p>
<p>
I released
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-21">LLM
0.21</a> with support for the new model, plus its <code>-o
reasoning_effort high</code> (or <code>medium</code> or
<code>low</code>) option for tweaking the reasoning effort - details
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/728">in this issue</a>.
</p>
<p>
Note that the new model is currently only available for
<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/usage-tiers#tier-3-rate-limits">Tier
3</a> and higher users, which requires you to have spent at least $100
on the API.
</p>
<p>
o3-mini <a href="https://openai.com/api/pricing/">is priced</a> at
$1.10/million input tokens, $4.40/million output tokens - less than half
the price of GPT-4o (currently $2.50/$10) and massively cheaper than o1
($15/60).
</p>
<p>
I tried using it to summarize
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42890627">this
conversation about o3-mini on Hacker News</a>, using
<a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/claude-hacker-news-themes#user-content-adding-a--m-model-option">my
hn-summary.sh script</a>.
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>hn-summary.sh 42890627 -o o3-mini</pre>
</div>
<p>
Here’s
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/09e5922be0cbb85894cf05e6d75ae050">the
result</a> - it used 18,936 input tokens and 2,905 output tokens for a
total cost of 3.3612 cents.
</p>
<p>
Another characteristic worth noting is o3-mini’s token output limit -
the measure of how much text it can output in one go. That’s 100,000
tokens, compared to 16,000 for GPT-4o and just 8,000 for both DeepSeek
R1 and Claude 3.5.
</p>
<p>
Invisible “reasoning tokens” come out of the same budget, so it’s likely
not possible to have it output the full 100,000.
</p>
<p>
The model accepts up to 200,000 tokens of input, an improvement on
GPT-4o’s 128,000.
</p>
<p>
An application where output limits really matter is translation between
human languages, where the output can realistically be expected to have
a similar length to the input. It will be interesting seeing how well
o3-mini works for that, especially given its low price.
</p>
<p>
Update: Here’s a
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42894215#42895610">fascinating
comment</a> on this by professional translator Tom Gally on Hacker News:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I just did a test in which both R1 and o3-mini got worse at translation
in the latter half of a long text. […]
</p>
<p>
An initial comparison of the output suggested that, while R1 didn’t seem
bad, o3-mini produced a writing style closer to what I asked for in the
prompt—smoother and more natural English. But then I noticed that the
output length was 5,855 characters for R1, 9,052 characters for o3-mini,
and 11,021 characters for my own polished version. Comparing the three
translations side-by-side with the original Japanese, I discovered that
R1 had omitted entire paragraphs toward the end of the speech, and that
o3-mini had switched to a strange abbreviated style (using slashes
instead of “and” between noun phrases, for example) toward the end as
well. The vanilla versions of ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini that I ran the
same prompt and text through a month ago had had none of those problems.
</p>

black (25.1.0) adds a newline after docstring and before pass in an
exception class</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, updated: 2025-01-31, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/psf/black/issues/4571">Latest black
(25.1.0) adds a newline after docstring and before pass in an exception
class</a></strong>
</p>
I filed a bug report against Black when the latest release - 25.1.0 -
reformatted the following code to add an ugly (to me) newline between
the docstring and the <code>pass</code>:
</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-v">ModelError</span>(<span class="pl-v">Exception</span>):
    <span class="pl-s">"Models can raise this error, which will be displayed to the user"</span>

    <span class="pl-k">pass</span></pre>
<p>
Black maintainer Jelle Zijlstra confirmed that this is intended behavior
with respect to
<a href="https://github.com/psf/black/issues/4522">Black’s 2025 stable
style</a>, but also helped me understand that the <code>pass</code>
there is actually unnecessary so I can fix the aesthetics by
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/commit/deb8bc3b4f5219583009eeb2c600d0b14c852c78">removing
that entirely</a>.
</p>
<p>
I’m linking to this issue because it’s a neat example of how I like to
include steps-to-reproduce using
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/">uvx</a> to create
one-liners you can paste into a terminal to see the bug that I’m
reporting. In this case I shared the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Here’s a way to see that happen using <code>uvx</code>. With the
previous Black version:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre><span class="pl-c1">echo</span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>class ModelError(Exception):</span>
<span class="pl-s">    "Models can raise this error, which will be displayed to the user"</span>
<span class="pl-s">    pass<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> <span class="pl-k">|</span> uvx --with <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>black==24.10.0<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> black -</pre>
</div>
<p>
This outputs:
</p>
<pre><code>class ModelError(Exception):
    "Models can raise this error, which will be displayed to the user"
    pass
All done! ✨ 🍰 ✨
1 file left unchanged.
</code></pre>
<p>
But if you bump to <code>25.1.0</code> this happens:
</p>

Labors of Hercules, First-Time Homebuyer</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: McSweeney’s Internet Tendency</p>
<p>
Hercules, demigod and hero, in a fit of madness brought on by <span
class="caps">FOMO</span> and too much <span class="caps">HGTV</span>,
did consult with the Oracle of Delphi about buying a house. The Oracle,
in her wisdom, and in partnership with Redfin, advised Hercules, “You
know, there’s really never a bad time to get on the property ladder.”
And thus, Hercules did put an offer in on a house, and he did cry out,
“Oh shit,” when it was accepted, and subsequently, these Twelve Labors
were imposed upon him.

<p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Slaying of the Goodwill Acceptable Donations Policy by
Surreptitiously Dropping Off, Among Other Items That Should Have Just
Gone in the Trash, the Red Wine-Stained Skin of the Nemean Lion, Which
Hercules Only Wore Once
</p>
<p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Slaying of the Movers Who Broke Hercules’s Only Box of Plates,
Not with Violence, But by Leaving a Scathing Google Review Comparing
Them to a Nine-Headed Hydra with a Case of the Dropsies
</p>
<p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The Capture of the Elusive 2022 W2 Form Required to Finalize
Hercule’s Mortgage Application, Which Was Somehow Not in the Bankers Box

<p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The Capture of Hercules’s Signature on 400-ish Pages of Legal
Documents at the Escrow Company That, While Wildly Boring, Made Him
Nauseous When He Realized That by the Time His Mortgage Is Finally Paid
Off, He’ll Be Older Than Chronos
</p>
<p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>The Single Day Cleansing of Hercules’s Apartment in a Futile Attempt
to Obtain His Security Deposit Back from His Landlord Augeus, and the
Later Navigation of the Google Search Results for “Small Claims Court

Discovered the Washing Machine Is Leaking

<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>The Seizing Up of Hercules’s Lower Back from Going Too Hard with a
Rented Stanley Steemer While He Was Trying to Get the Stains That Look
Like a Stampede of Incontinent Cattle Ran Through the Living Room, All
of Which Were Covered by Staging Furniture at the Open House, Out of His
Carpets
</p>
<p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>The Retrieval of the Organic Golden Apples from Whole Foods Because
Hercules Hasn’t Eaten Anything Except for DoorDash Taco Bell for a Week

the Dog Sitters and Bringing Him Back to the New Home Where He Has
Nervous Diarrhea All Over Hercules’s Newly Cleaned Carpet
</p>
<p>
After Hercules had completed these labors, he invited his
half-brother/great-grandpa Perseus over to check out the new place.
Perseus, as a housewarming offering, did bring over a scented candle
from Bath and Body Works and then threw it out there that he’d be happy
anytime to petrify the <span class="caps">HOA</span> president with the
head of Medusa.
</p>
<p>
But then, because this is a Tragedy, Perseus also rudely pointed out
that, even though finishing the Labors was quite a feat, Hercules hadn’t
even started unpacking yet.

<h2>
A quarterly column from Carrie Brownstein, who is better at dispensing
advice than taking it.
</h2>
<p>
<span class="dropcap">Q:</span> <i>What is an appropriate amount of time
to stay at your friend’s art show if you’re not interested in the social
aspect of that kind of thing? I’m all about showing up to support
people, but I find the conversations at these events so tedious and
performative. And I hate who these events make me become: I find myself
trying to fit in, while also judging my friends, who are all of a sudden
talking differently and putting on airs. Should I just suffer through
them?</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>JD<br /> Los Angeles, CA</i>
</p>
<p>
<span class="dropcap">A:</span> I went to college in a small town where
we had to make our own fun. Lots of what we did was reimagine and
emulate big-city functions like art openings, musicals, and fashion
shows. Our events were scrappy, shambolic, and wonderful. They worked
because we intentionally aimed for gilded and saw no value in actual
gold. But when there’s a lack of self-awareness, these gatherings can
feel performative and contrived. That being said, I now live in a
medium-sized city, and the last time I attended one of these events, and
felt my skin begin to crawl when confronted with a mid-Atlantic accent
and Truman Capote cosplay, I started to think that maybe everyone—even
in New York or Paris or London—is simply acting out an idea of what it
means to be a partygoer or an art aficionado or an intellectual. So what
is the appropriate amount of time to stay at your friend’s art show?
However long you can stand to pretend along with the other fakers.
</p>
<div class="break">
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li>-
</div>
<p>
<span class="dropcap">Q:</span> <i>I’ve gone on a number of art museum
dates, but I’m not sure how good of an idea they are. They’re starting
to feel like screening tests that invariably detect a problem. On one
occasion, I was with someone I seemed to have a lot in common with, but
we ended up clashing over most of the canvases—he saw laziness where I
saw fleeting beauty; he saw bold defiance where I saw petulant
rebellion. It got so tense that we ended up leaving early.
</p>
<p>
Another time, my date paused at nearly every painting to say something
like “This painting is so me!” She projected herself onto everything,
from portraits to landscapes, relating each one back to herself. Her
constant self-comparison gave me the ick, and I decided to call things
off.
</p>
<p>
These experiences have me wondering if the art museum brings out the
worst in my dates, or in me. Should I stop taking future dates there, or
is this actually a good way to gauge someone’s character?</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Jess<br /> Chicago, IL</i>
</p>
<p>
<span class="dropcap">A:</span> Clashing over art should not be a
deal-breaker, as long as there is mutual respect in both delivery and
intent, a willingness to entertain opposing views, and perhaps the
concession that a right or wrong interpretation is beside the point. On
the other hand, “This painting is so me!” is an absolute deal-breaker
and your reaction was entirely appropriate. (At the very least, you’ve
spared yourself from ever having to hear the words, “This breakup is so
me!”)
</p>
<p>
As to your question, I do wonder if museum-going is best left for
further along in a potential relationship. While gently sparring over a
painting or sculpture can be stimulating, it can be irksome too. Also
irritating, I would think, is the constant affirmation and parroting of
our own views. Plus, you need to be wary of the mutual desire to
establish common interests early on, often while obfuscating more
nuanced or even contrary predilections. And while you posit museum-going
as a test of character, perhaps you’re simply struggling with the
age-old quandary of whether opposites attract or if shared interests
prevail. Or, to be less trite, maybe you deem yourself someone with good
taste and are thus looking for someone else with good (i.e., your own)
taste. No shame there! I probably wouldn’t date anyone who’d never heard
of Poly Styrene or Elaine May.
</p>
<p>
So might I suggest a deeper examination of what you’re looking for when
you say “character.” My hunch is you could replace “museum” with just
about any context, and face the same conundrum: finding a romantic
partner, someone who really sees you and loves you for who you are, is
really, really hard. It’s often easier to look for faults and reasons
not to try. Therefore, maybe gauging good character is less about how a
date responds to David Wojnarowicz and more about how vulnerable, silly,
sexy, gross, smart, and just plain stupid you can be with someone, and
finding someone who can be those same things around you. No judgment, no
ridicule. A person you can trust not only with your excellent taste in
culture, but with your heart. If art matters to you, witness it with
someone who matters to you as well. Sigh. This answer is so me! (I’ll
show myself out.)

<h2 id="an-oral-history-of-the-kidz-bop-cover-of-john-cages-433">An Oral
History of the Kidz Bop Cover of John Cage’s 4′33″</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: McSweeney’s Internet Tendency</p>
<h4>
Part One: The Kidz
</h4>
<p>
<strong>Dana Wilkinson, <i>Kidz Bop Producer</i>:</strong> People don’t
remember this, but there was a draft in the early 2000s. We’d show up at
some third-grader’s door, and they could only bring one duffle bag and a
handful of their homeland’s soil with them. We called them the Kidz
Korp.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Eileen Atwater, <i>Kidz Bop Kid</i>:</strong> The Kidz Korp was
run by Irving “Big Irv” Schopenhauer, who was a studio exec from the
1940s.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Harry Collins, <i>Kidz Bop Kid</i>:</strong> Big Irv was strict
but fair. We could only eat cat food and cigarettes, but we could have
all the cat food and cigarettes we wanted.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mike “Fancy Feast” Lewis, <i>Kidz Bop Kid</i> [<i>archival
interview</i>]:</strong> We all ate the cat food. I don’t know why I’m
the only one who got the nickname Fancy Feast… I’ll die a happy man if
no one ever calls me Fancy Feast again.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Ed. note: Mike “Fancy Feast” Lewis was killed in 2014 when his
tanning bed fused shut and burst into flames.</i>]
</p>
<p>
<strong>Harry Collins:</strong> Fancy Feast said that? Crazy.
</p>
<h4>
Part Two: The Piece
</h4>
<p>
<strong>Eileen Atwater:</strong> The whole idea behind John Cage’s
<i>4′33″</i> was that the sounds of everyday life were just as
interesting and engaging as those in a traditional piece of classical
music.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Harry Collins:</strong> He wanted you to listen to the sounds
you usually ignore. Like people breathing and birds chirping. I wasn’t
all that excited about it, but they kept telling us that if we didn’t do
what they said, they’d sell us to Randy Quaid, and he’d hunt us for
sport. So yeah, we fell in line.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Harvey Roth:</strong> We were all terrified of Randy Quaid. The
only movie they let us watch was <i>Caddyshack II</i>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Irving “Big Irv” Schopenhauer [<i>archival
interview</i>]:</strong> Well, ah, in the original piece, it’s mostly
people fidgeting and coughing and stuff. It wasn’t very kid-oriented. So
we thought, why not get a clown and let him do this thing? Then, we’ll
get audio of the kids in the audience reacting.
</p>
<h4>
Part Three: Showtime
</h4>
<p>
<strong>Dana Wilkinson:</strong> I don’t know where they found that
fucking clown. I think they paid him in cough syrup.
</p>
<p>
<i>When the piece begins, the first sounds you can hear are some
tentative giggles. Then, about forty-five seconds in, you hear Eileen
Atwater’s distinctive gasp.</i>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Eileen Atwater:</strong> People still recognize me, “Oh, are you
the little girl who gasps in <i>4′33″</i>?” What they don’t know is that
I gasped because the clown was trying to balance on a skateboard while
holding two lit torches, and I guess I was the only one who saw it
coming.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Harry Collins:</strong> The clown was juggling fire. We all knew
that was [record executive] Al Hirschfield’s idea, because Al
Hirschfield had a saying: “If a little fire is good, a lot of fire must
be great!” Poor guy. No one ever explained fire to him, I guess.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dana Wilkinson:</strong> Al Hirschfield? He was killed in 2014
when his tanning bed fused shut and burst into flames.
</p>
<p>
<i>In a cough-syrup-induced haze, the clown drops one of the torches.
The curtains immediately ignite. That’s when the kids start
screaming.</i>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mike “Fancy Feast” Lewis [<i>archival interview</i>]:</strong>
The first wave of screams is playful, like maybe it was all planned. I
don’t know; I was six, and I hadn’t slept in three months. I was
hallucinating that my blood was alive and trying to escape out of my
feet. I later found out I had mercury poisoning from all the cat food we
were eating.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dana Wilkinson:</strong> The curtains went up in flames, and the
kids were stampeding toward the exit. I tried to throw some of the cat
litter from the kids’ litter boxes on the clown, but I think he was
already dead by that point.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Al Hirschfield [<i>archival interview</i>]:</strong> The only
people who didn’t flee were me and Big Irv. He just kept screaming,
“Keep rolling! Keep rolling!” That’s mostly what you hear in the
finished recording: him yelling and me chanting the Mourner’s Kaddish
for the clown.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dana Wilkinson:</strong> Listen, if you’re gonna cry about every
clown that dies during a Kidz Bop recording session, you’ll never get
anything done. I learned that on my first day on the job.
</p>
<h4>
Part Four: The Legacy
</h4>
<p>
<strong>Eileen Atwater:</strong> It’s nice that it’s had such an impact
over the years.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Harry Collins:</strong> People come up to me all the time and
are like, “Is it true you watched a clown burn to death, and they
recorded it for a Kidz Bop album?” No one ever believes that to us, it
was just another Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mike “Fancy Feast” Lewis [<i>archival interview</i>]:</strong> I
can’t listen to it anymore. It just makes me crave cat food.
</p>
<p>
<i>Editor’s Note: </i>4′33″<i> composer John Cage passed away in 1992
when his tanning bed fused shut and burst into flames. His estate has
formally denounced the Kidz Korp.</i>

way to save memory with BytesIO</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, updated: 2025-01-31, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://pythonspeed.com/articles/bytesio-reduce-memory-usage/">The
surprising way to save memory with BytesIO</a></strong>
</p>
Itamar Turner-Trauring explains that if you have a <code>BytesIO</code>
object in Python calling <code>.read()</code> on it will create a full
copy of that object, doubling the amount of memory used - but calling
<code>.getvalue()</code> returns a <code>bytes</code> object that uses
no additional memory, instead using copy-on-write.
</p>
<p>
<p><code>.getbuffer()</code> is another memory-efficient option but it
returns a
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview">memoryview</a>
which has less methods than the <code>bytes</code> you get back from
<code>.getvalue()</code>- it doesn’t have <code>.find()</code> for
example.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;Via &lt;a href=&quot;https://lobste.rs/s/gvhivz/surprising_way_save_memory_with_bytesio&quot;&gt;lobste.rs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
