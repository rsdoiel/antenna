id="macos-sequia-will-nag-you-every-week-if-you-have-screenshot-apps-and-screen-recorders-installed">macOS
Sequia will nag you every week if you have screenshot apps and screen
recorders installed</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>With macOS Sequoia this fall, using apps that need access to screen
recording permissions will become a little bit more tedious. Apple is
rolling out a change that will require you to give explicit permission
on a weekly basis to these types of apps, and every time you reboot your
Mac. If you’ve been using the macOS Sequoia beta this summer in
conjunction with a third-party screenshot or screen recording app,
you’ve likely been prompted multiple times to continue allowing that app
access to your screen. While many speculated this could be a bug, that’s
not the case. ↫ Chance Miller Everybody is making comparisons to Windows
Vista, but I don’t think that’s fair at all. Windows Vista suffered from
an avelanche of permission dialogs because the wider Windows
application, driver, and peripheral ecosystem was not at all used to the
security boundaries present in Windows NT being enforced. Vista was the
first consumer-focused version of Windows that started doing this, and
after a difficult transition period, the flood of dialogs settled down,
and for a long time now you can blame Windows for a lot of things, but
it’s definitely not throwing up more permission dialogs than, say, an
average desktop-focused Linux distribution. In other words, Vista’s UAC
dialogs were a desperately necessary evil, an adjustment period the
Windows ecosystem simply had to go through, and Windows as a whole is
better off for it today. This, however, is different. This is Apple
having such a low opinion of its users, and such a deep disregard for
basic usability and computer ownership, that it feels entirely okay with
bothering its users with weekly – or more, if you tend to reboot – nag
dialogs for applications the user has already properly given permission
to. I don’t have any real issues with a reminder or permission dialog
upon first launching a newly installed screen recording application – or
when an exisiting application gains this functionality in an update –
but nagging users weekly is just beyond insanity. More and more it feels
like macOS is becoming an operating system for toddlers – or at least,
that’s how Apple seems to view its users.</p>

id="as-japan-marks-atomic-bombing-anniversaries-its-military-emerges-from-shadow-of-wwii">As
Japan marks atomic bombing anniversaries, its military emerges from
shadow of WWII</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Tokyo — Japan this week restated its aim to rid the world of atomic
weapons as it marks the 79th anniversary of the nuclear bombings of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki — even as the Japanese government seeks
assurances the United States would be willing to use its own nuclear
arsenal to protect Japan.</p>
<p>At 8:15 a.m. Tuesday — the time that the atomic bomb exploded 600
meters (1,969 feet) above Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 — people across
Japan marked a minute’s silence to remember the horrors visited on the
city.</p>
<p>“It is the mission of Japan, the only country to have suffered
nuclear war, to pass on the reality of the atomic bombings to future
generations,” Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told delegates
gathered in Hiroshima.</p>
<p>The manner of Japan’s defeat in World War II changed the country,
driving an aversion to war and military power that lasted for
generations. However, after decades of pacifism, the country is
undergoing profound changes in its attitude to military power amid
multiple regional threats, said Yee Kuang Heng, a professor of
international relations at the University of Tokyo.</p>
<p>“The DPRK’s [North Korea’s] nuclear missile programs; Chinese
military assertiveness and territorial claims in the East China Sea;
Russia’s closer military cooperation with China in the past couple of
years. These are underlying drivers that have been around for the past
couple of years,” Heng told VOA.</p>
<p>“There is Prime Minister Kishida’s oft-quoted fear that Ukraine today
could be East Asia tomorrow, especially with potential flashpoints close
to Japan, such as Taiwan.”</p>
<p>Those threats prompted Japan to last year announce a doubling of
defense spending, to 2% of gross domestic product by 2027.</p>
<p>Last week, the United States, Japan’s closest ally, announced a major
upgrade of its military command in the country. During the visit by U.S.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin,
Tokyo again sought assurances from the U.S. that it would be prepared to
use “extended deterrence” — that is, nuclear weapons — to defend
Japan.</p>
<p>“They have always had doubts about the American commitment to use all
their might to defend them. And that includes nuclear weapons, which
gives you some idea of just how somewhat paradoxical Japan’s supposed
nuclear allergy is,” said Grant Newsham, a senior fellow at the
Washington-based Center for Security Policy and a former U.S. Marines
colonel who served in Japan.</p>
<p>For decades, anger among Asian neighbors over Japan’s actions in
World War II prevented closer regional cooperation. That’s also
changing, said analyst Heng.</p>
<p>“Countries like the Philippines, they’ve recently signed very
important defense agreements with Japan, such as the Reciprocal Access
Agreement, actually the first Asian country to do so with Japan,” he
said. “South Korea, notably under President Yoon [Suk Yeol], has talked
up a more forward-looking relationship with Japan.”</p>
<p>But 79 years after the trauma of defeat — the destruction of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki — are the Japanese people ready to become a
military power once more?</p>
<p>“There’s a sea change also in the public opinion in my country as
well,” said Kunihiko Miyake of Japan’s Canon Institute for Global
Studies.</p>
<p>“We are not rabbits. We are tortoises. We are probably slow, but we
always go ahead, and one step forward at a time,” Miyake added. “Maybe
this time, two or three steps forward.”</p>
<p>China has reacted with anger to the rapid changes in Japan’s military
posture.</p>
<p>“During World War II, Japan invaded and colonized some Southeast
Asian countries, including the Philippines, and committed serious
historical crimes. Japan needs to seriously reflect on its history of
aggression and act prudently in the field of military security,” said
Lin Jian, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, during
a press conference last month.</p>
<p>At the same time, say analysts, Japan must secure itself against
multiple threats — not least from China itself.</p>

Paris Olympics wind down, Los Angeles swings into planning for 2028</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PARIS — From the City of Love to the City of Angels, planning for the
2028 Los Angeles Olympics is well underway and organizers are paying
close attention to what’s worked, and what hasn’t, so far in Paris. </p>
<p>It will be LA’s third time hosting the Olympics — the last time was
40 years ago — and first time hosting the Paralympic Games. </p>
<p>Janet Evans remembers sitting in the stands at the Los Angeles
Memorial Coliseum during the opening ceremony for the 1984 Summer
Olympics as a 12-year-old. </p>
<p>“I remember watching those athletes march out behind their country’s
flags in their beautiful opening ceremony uniforms and thinking, ‘I want
to do that,’” Evans said. </p>
<p>That was before she went on to win four gold medals and set world
records as a U.S. Olympic swimmer. Now, as chief athlete officer for
LA2028, the organizing committee bringing the Games to LA, she is
focused on giving a voice to athletes and their concerns. </p>
<p>“Having lived in three Olympic Villages and having competed in three
Olympic Games … it’s really important to understand what the athletes
are experiencing,” Evans said. </p>
<p>Much of the focus will be on hearing from athletes about their
concerns after the Games are over. But Evans said some of the concerns
that have been floated in the last few weeks — reports of uncomfortable
beds, limited air conditioning and food shortages — won’t be an issue in
LA, which plans to house the athletes on the UCLA campus. </p>
<p>“We feed thousands of students a day. UCLA houses thousands of
students a day and so we’re tried and tested and true,” she said. “I eat
the food once a week, at least, at UCLA, which is delicious. So I can
vouch for that.” </p>
<p>As for concerns specific to Los Angeles, top of mind for many is the
gridlocked traffic on freeways and streets in the City of Dreams and
Hollywood. </p>
<p>Evans said the plan is to work around some challenges by making
deliveries for athletes late at night, work with companies to implement
a more robust work-from-home plan for employees in the Southern
California region for the duration of the Games and institute “Olympic
lanes” to ensure athletes can “get from point A to point B
quicker.” </p>
<p>The official handoff to Los Angeles will take place on Sunday evening
during the closing ceremony in Paris. Evans hopes the buildup in the
next four years and LA’s own opening ceremony will inspire a new
generation of spectators to follow their dreams. </p>
<p>“That’s what the Olympics do — they change people’s lives,” Evans
said. “I think that’s why everyone loves the Olympics. It brings people
together.”</p>

<h2 id="the-feds-are-coming-for-solar-scammers">The Feds Are Coming for
Solar Scammers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzEzMzc5Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NTcyMjA5N30.uVQLn5snq71P-g0rTEN_gVc15e3wiw7XfmxiyQfMPZE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/>
<p>
Federal regulators are joining forces on a fresh effort to go after
solar energy scams and help the public parse potentially deceptive
business practices in the industry.
</p>
<p>
Treasury Department officials said Wednesday they will soon release a
consumer advisory warning against deceptive sales practices, officials
said at a public event featuring leaders at Treasury as well as the
Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. These
agencies are also releasing a slew of documents to help American
consumers gauge whether solar marketers are legitimate and encourage
people to report any potential fraudulent behavior in the sector to come
forward to the government for potential inquiry.
</p>
<p>
Solar energy fraud at the residential consumer level is a rare but
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/suburban-chicago-man-scammed-solar-panel-contractor/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>profoundly
painful phenomenon</u></a> that can acutely harm low- and middle-income
households. At the public event announcing the move, officials said they
took this step after seeing a rising amount of consumer losses due to
frauds and predatory behavior in the household solar space. More than a
quarter of a billion dollars in solar-related fraud has been reported
between January 2022 and June of this year, FTC Chair Lina Khan said.
The Internal Revenue Service issued a warning in July against new
efforts by fraudsters to cite the Inflation Reduction Act
<a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-warns-of-new-scam-targeting-clean-energy-tax-credit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in
predatory pitches</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
As Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said at the event, any time a
major law passes and unleashes federal dollars to support consumers, you
will “have people trying to take advantage” – but “like in most
industries, these bad actors represent a small number of solar
companies.”
</p>
<p>
CFPB Director Rohit Chopra, meanwhile, sounded a note of concern. “I’m
really worried about this,” he said, pointing to the 2007-2008 subprime
mortgage crisis and saying these behaviors pose the risk of
“undermin[ing] the growth and development of residential solar programs
in our country.”
</p>
<p>
Chopra pointed to a specific business practice regulators that can be
concerning: sales quotas and commissions. “Sometimes when those are set
in unreasonable ways, it can create the conditions where people who are
on the frontlines selling these products go too far.”

“AI”</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>When you’re shopping online, you’ll likely find yourself jumping
between multiple tabs to read reviews and research prices. It can be
cumbersome doing all that back and forth tab switching, and online
comparison is something we hear users want help with. In the next few
weeks, starting in the U.S., Chrome will introduce Tab compare, a new
feature that presents an AI-generated overview of products from across
multiple tabs, all in one place. Imagine you’re looking for a new
Bluetooth portable speaker for an upcoming trip, but the product details
and reviews are spread across different pages and websites. Soon, Chrome
will offer to generate a comparison table by showing a suggestion next
to your tabs. By bringing all the essential details — product specs,
features, price, ratings — into one tab, you’ll be able to easily
compare and make an informed decision without the endless tab switching.
↫ Parisa Tabriz Is this really what people want from their browser, or
am I just completely out of touch? I’m not at all convinced the latter
isn’t the case, but this just seems like a filler feature. Is this
really what all the AI hype is about? Is this kind of nonsense the end
game we’re killing the planet even harder for?</p>

<h2 id="digital-nudges">Digital nudges</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I design and code things for the web. I build them for myself, for friends, and clients. In doing that I have to make assumptions about how people behave. Because websites aren’t—usually—art pieces. They’re tools, used by people. People like yourself. And let me tell you: you’re quite unpredictable. When I build things for myself, I’m guided by a series of very simple principles:&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
Don’t waste their time
</li>
<li>
Don’t make things complicated for no reason
</li>
<li>
Don’t add pointless distractions
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The problem though, is that my way of experiencing the web is skewed by
the fact that I spend almost all my days working on this damn thing. And
so my assumptions on how people behave are sometimes incredibly wrong.
</p>
<p>
For example: the other day someone got in touch and asked if there’s a
way to support what I do
(<a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">there is</a>). This link is
present on literally every single page of my site, just below the end of
the content. It’s also present in every single post in my RSS feed. And
yet, some people don’t see it.
</p>
<p>
The same story is true for my
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/guestbook">guestbook</a>. The link to
it is right there, just below the end of this post. And yet, every time
I mention it directly in a post, a bunch of people sign it, as if it’s
the first time they see it mentioned even though there’s a link to it in
every single post on this site.
</p>
<p>
And every time something like this happens I’m left wondering if my
assumptions about what people notice on a site are just plain wrong.
Maybe there’s a reason why creators in other types of media keep
repeating the same damn thing—like and subscribe, leave a review—at
every occasion. Maybe the attention span online is so low that you need
to repeat something a thousand times before one goes through. Which is…
sad? I don’t know, part of me refuses to believe this because I have
high hopes for you all out there. I think we’re all collectively better
than this.
</p>

safety board plans to quiz officials about FAA oversight of Boeing
before a panel blew off a 737</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A federal safety board planned on Wednesday to probe the
Federal Aviation Administration’s oversight of Boeing and how it has
changed since a door plug blew off a Boeing 737 Max in midflight. </p>
<p>The National Transportation Safety Board is holding a two-day hearing
on the blowout during an Alaska Airlines flight in January.</p>
<p>Door plugs are installed on some 737s to seal a cutout left for an
extra exit that was not required on the Alaska jet. The plug on the
Alaska plane was opened at a Boeing factory to let workers fix damaged
rivets, but bolts that help secure the panel were not replaced when the
plug was closed.</p>
<p>A Boeing official said Tuesday that the company is redesigning door
plugs so they cannot be closed until they are properly secured.
Elizabeth Lund, who was named Boeing’s senior vice president of quality
shortly after the blowout, said the company hopes to complete the fix
within about a year, and that 737s already in service will be
retrofitted.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, safety board members were scheduled to question
representatives from Boeing and key supplier Spirit AeroSystems on their
safety systems. They also plan to ask FAA officials about the agency’s
monitoring of Boeing. including “changes in oversight methods.”</p>
<p>FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker told Congress in June that the
agency’s oversight was “too hands-off” before the blowout but has since
put more inspectors inside Boeing and Spirit factories. Whitaker is not
scheduled to testify.</p>
<p>The accident on Alaska Airlines flight 1282 occurred minutes after
takeoff from Portland, Oregon, on Jan. 5. The blowout left a hole in the
plane, oxygen masks dropped and the cockpit door flew open. Miraculously
there were no major injuries, and pilots were able to return to Portland
and land the plane safely.</p>

<p>date: 2024-08-07, updated: 2024-08-07, from: RAND blog</p>
<p>Despite Russia’s claims of robust arms production and export
capabilities, Moscow faces significant challenges. Declining sales,
reliance on outdated weaponry, and strained international relationships
indicate a stark contrast between state propaganda and the reality faced
by the Russian arms industry.</p>

We now know who the Veep wants as Veep: Vice President Kamala Harris
announced on Tuesday that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will be her running
mate in this year’s presidential election. But what does he bring to the
table economically? We’ll dig in. Plus, total household debt in the U.S.
is creeping up, and a new nonprofit aims to measure whether companies’

Grueskin in Columbia Journalism Review</a>]

<blockquote>
<p>
“What’s most important is that a disruptive start-up not be placed at
the mercy of the old organization—which might see the upstart as a
competitive threat and attempt to have it shut down or cause it to
fail.”
</p>
<p>
“[…] Newsroom managers must figure out if their current staff is
equipped—intellectually, emotionally, technologically—to handle the pace
of change in the business.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Interesting reflections here on newsrooms that split in order to
incubate future-facing innovation alongside their legacy businesses. It
seems like a good idea to me, if you can afford it: a pro-innovation
culture is likely to shed the bureaucracy and processes that may be
present in an older business. (This isn’t just true for newspapers vs
“digital”, whatever digital is: it’s also true for businesses that are
set in an older version of the web.)
</p>
<p>
The trouble is, as this article notes, that these innovative newsrooms
are likely to be so successful that they end up re-merging with the main
newsroom and falling under its control. At that point the culture of
innovation tends to die, which is something anyone in the tech industry
who watched Yahoo acquire startups in the mid-2000s will recognize
clearly.
</p>
<p>
So what’s the solution? I think there isn’t one. It may be more
effective for the innovative newsrooms to be spun off completely, so
that they aren’t so much parallel sides of the same organization as new
organizations entirely, with a more complete ability to reinvent how
they work. My guess is that this would extend far beyond new modes of
content and audience engagement and extend to the experience of working
itself. After all, that’s exactly what happened in tech - an exploration
that, depending on the organization, was often positive for tech
workers. Some people in news describe tech workers as “coddled”; I’d
describe it more as “free to invent”.

“Following President Joe Biden’s exit from the 2024 election, Democratic
supporters have gained a massive influx of energy and support all over
the Web. Hours after the president made his announcement, Heidi Li
Feldman, a law professor emeritus at Georgetown University, launched an
ActBlue fundraiser comprising of Mastodon users.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s been pretty successful: almost half a million dollars at the time
this article was written. It’s another example of how Mastodon users are
politically engaged, more active per capita than any other social
network, and ready to contribute.
</p>
<p>
It’s also a facet of Mastodon’s wider userbase that there were some
criticisms this money was being raised for the Presidential election
than, say, local mutual aid. From my perspective, both are important:
perhaps there’s a way to learn from this in order to fund a wider mutual
aid campaign, but contributing to an election campaign to stop an
authoritarian, nationalistic second Trump administration feels
incredibly important.
</p>
<p>
Political purity tests and fractions unfortunately are a feature of
Mastodon’s communities, and will likely continue to be - but one
positive way of looking at it is that it means they care, a lot, and are
interested in ways to improve the lives of vulnerable people. That’s an
incredibly good thing that should give us all hope for the future.

Decentralized</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>

Levine at Bloomberg</a>]
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Here’s a thing. It costs $1. If you buy one, the next one will cost $2.
If someone buys it, the next one will cost $4. Et cetera. The price of
the thing always goes up, leaving every buyer (except the most recent
one) with a large guaranteed profit. Of course they can’t sell the thing
to realize the profit, but that too is a benefit: If they can’t sell,
the price can’t go down.
</p>
<p>
“Man, 2019 was just amazing. That was an economic model that you could
<em>advertise</em>.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It genuinely is incredible. Matt Levine is incredulous that anyone could
think that they could avoid SEC regulation because something was
“decentralized” - but even then, BitCloud <em>wasn’t really
decentralized</em>.
</p>
<p>
In a way, I’m a little envious: it seems like one could have raised
millions and millions of dollars for some crypto venture and actually,
with complete impunity, openly spent it on something else that really
had nothing to do with a token scheme. Imagine what could have been
funded that way!
</p>
<p>
As Matt points out:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“And then you could just take the money! And be like “what, I told you I
wouldn’t spend it on developing the protocol, and I didn’t.”“
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What a time. Anyway, I’m sure nothing like it is happening in the tech
industry right now.

<ol type="1">
<li>Tim Walz supercharges Kamala Harris’ climate cred
</h3>
<p>
Vice President Kamala Harris yesterday tapped Minnesota Governor Tim
Walz to be her running mate in the 2024 presidential election,

the climate left</a>. Of all the finalists reportedly in contention,
Walz had the most impressive clean energy and environmental
accomplishments:

Within
<a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/1060123097?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8h1s4R5Czk7JBMWZ4wowX4Nd9ceBUpNkhoJPmFvbvdVWBbj_ZW7e0UJooBWUKr298lnWjW" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">months</a>
of being sworn in as governor of Minnesota in 2019, Walz set a goal for
his state to get its electricity from 100% carbon-free sources by 2050.
By the time Walz signed actual emissions legislation into law last year,
he’d set an even more ambitious timeline — carbon-free electricity by
2040. The bill also streamlined permitting, set a minimum wage for
employees constructing large-scale utility projects, and included an
environmental justice provision to keep energy from waste incineration
plants in frontline communities from counting toward the 2040 goal.
</li>
<li>
Walz secured a $2 billion budget package that included grid
improvements, solar panels on state-owned buildings, an electric-vehicle
rebate program, heat pump grants and rebates, a green bank, and more.
</li>
<li>
He signed a transportation bill to overhaul transit hubs, expand
passenger rail service, improve infrastructure, and offer electric bike
credits.
</li>

Earlier this summer, Walz announced a
<a href="https://mn.gov/governor/newsroom/press-releases/?id=1055-638440&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8h1s4R5Czk7JBMWZ4wowX4Nd9ceBUpNkhoJPmFvbvdVWBbj_ZW7e0UJooBWUKr298lnWjW" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$200
million grant</a> to reduce food-related pollution, including protecting
and restoring carbon-absorbing peatlands, improving food waste programs,
and replacing gas-powered agricultural machinery with trucks that run on
electricity or clean fuel.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In a statement, Evergreen Action Executive Director Lena Moffitt
applauded Walz’s “masterclass in how to govern in a way that
meaningfully improves people’s lives and sets the state up for a
thriving future.” Cassidy DiPaola, the communications director at Fossil
Free Media and a spokesperson for the Make Polluters Pay campaign,
likewise acknowledged Walz’s progress on green issues, nodding to his
“evolution into a climate champion.” She added that Walz has more than
proven himself at the state level and that “his ability to connect
climate policy to the everyday concerns of Midwestern and rural voters
could prove invaluable in building broader support for climate action.”

<li>New data shows how Americans are using the IRA
</h3>
<p>
The Treasury Department today released new data that offers the most
significant insight yet into how Americans are actually using the
Inflation Reduction Act. The numbers show more than 3 million households
used the IRA’s subsidies for homeowners last year, collectively saving
more than $8 billion on things like solar panels, batteries, heat pumps,
insulation, and other clean energy technologies and efficiency upgrades.
A closer look at the data reveals the rooftop solar tax credit was
especially popular, and particularly in sun belt states (no big
surprises there perhaps). Northeastern states leapt at the energy
efficiency tax credit, which encourages Americans to make energy
efficient changes to their home, e.g. installing a heat pump or a more
efficient water heater. But “not all of the data flatters the Biden
administration’s goals,”

Emily Pontecorvo and Robinson Meyer for Heatmap</a>. “The tax credits —
especially those that reward energy-efficient home upgrades — are used
in large part by richer households who have the money and wherewithal to
pay for costly upgrades to their homes in the first place.” Read their

a new kind of car paint</a> that it claims can reflect the sun’s
near-infrared rays and redirect the energy back into the atmosphere,

on a Nissan NV100 service vehicle as it drives around on the scorching
tarmac at Tokyo International Air Terminal. Early results have been
“impressive,” the company said in
<a href="https://europe.nissannews.com/en-GB/releases/nissan-trialing-cool-paint-technology?&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8h1s4R5Czk7JBMWZ4wowX4Nd9ceBUpNkhoJPmFvbvdVWBbj_ZW7e0UJooBWUKr298lnWjW" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a

temperatures by about 10 degrees Fahrenheit, and cutting exterior
surface temperatures by about 21 degrees. “A cooler cabin is not only
more pleasant to enter, but also requires less air-conditioning run-time
to cool the cabin to a comfortable temperature,” Nissan said. “This
helps reduce load to the engine, or in the case of an electric vehicle,
draw on the battery. In both powertrains, an improvement in efficiency
is expected, as well as occupant comfort.”

Storm Debby expected to make landfall in South Carolina again</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>white house — Tropical Storm Debby is expected to make landfall for a
second time in South Carolina late Wednesday or early Thursday, having
taken the lives of six people earlier in the week.  </p>
<p>The storm hit the southeast United States on Monday, initially making
landfall in Florida as a Category 1 Hurricane. It has since moved into
the western Atlantic but continues to cause concern as it is predicted
to regain some strength before hitting South Carolina again. </p>
<p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis issued an executive order on August 2,
prior to the storm making landfall, and declared a state of emergency in
61 counties. The order gave state officials the ability to distribute
resources to areas that were expected to be impacted by the storm. </p>
<p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre outlined the federal
government’s response to the story at a press briefing Tuesday. </p>
<p>“The Biden-Harris administration has been in close touch with
officials from affected states and FEMA has deployed staff to the region
to support as needed,” she said. </p>
<p>Federal support such as FEMA’s Urban Search and Rescue Teams, the
U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and more have been
deployed and will provide support to the impacted areas as needed. </p>
<p>Jean-Pierre continued, “The president has approved emergency
declaration requests from the governors of Florida, South Carolina and
Georgia, which will unlock additional federal resources.”   </p>
<p>The White House is also recommending that those who remain in
Tropical Storm Debby’s path to stay alert and visit ready.gov for safety
tips. </p>
<p>A series of disasters </p>
<p>Tropical Storm Debby comes less than a month after reports of power
outages that affected millions in Texas, resulting in seven reported
deaths due to heat exposure. The power issues were part of the aftermath
of Hurricane Beryl, which first hit the state on July 8. The storm also
comes just weeks after Illinois saw 25 tornadoes hit the Chicago area in
the span of two days. </p>
<p>As the summer’s climate disasters continue, affected areas will seek
the support of the federal government and Biden administration to help
offset damages and minimize the risk of casualties. The administration
has made climate change a key issue since President Joe Biden took
office in 2021. </p>
<p>“Climate-fueled disasters are impacting communities nationwide — and
it’s costing the U.S. billions every year,” White House spokesperson
Jeremy M. Edwards told VOA on Wednesday. </p>
<p>“That’s why President Biden is leading the most ambitious climate
agenda in history, including securing the Inflation Reduction Act, the
largest-ever climate investment, which provides billions to help
communities build resilience to these increasingly frequent and extreme
weather events.”   </p>
<p>The Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in 2022 and aims to
combat air pollution and climate change. The Biden administration faced
climate-based criticism in 2023 after it approved the Willow Project,
which allows for massive oil drilling in Alaska.   </p>
<p>Some $92.9 billion in damages from natural disasters were recorded in
2023, reaching a record high of 28 such events that cost more than $1
billion. As of July, the National Centers for Environmental Information
confirmed 15 disasters that have cost the U.S. more than $1 billion so
far in 2024.</p>

a cryptographically secure bootloader for RISC-V in Rust</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>It seems to be bootloader season, because we’ve got another one –
this time, a research project with very limited application for most
people. SentinelBoot is a cryptographically secure bootloader aimed at
enhancing boot flow safety of RISC-V through memory-safe principles,
predominantly leveraging the Rust programming language with its
ownership, borrowing, and lifetime constraints. Additionally,
SentinelBoot employs public-key cryptography to verify the integrity of
a booted kernel (digital signature), by the use of the RISC-V Vector
Cryptography extension, establishing secure boot functionality.
SentinelBoot achieves these objectives with a 20.1% hashing overhead
(approximately 0.27s additional runtime) when compared to an example
U-Boot binary (mainline at time of development), and produces a
resulting binary one-tenth the size of an example U-Boot binary with
half the memory footprint. ↫ Lawrence Hunter SentinelBoot is a project
undertaken at the University of Manchester, and its goal is probably
clear from the description: to develop a more secure bootloader for RISC
V devices. An additional element is that they looked specifically at
devices that receive updates over-the-air, like smartphones. In
addition, scenarios where an attacker has physical access to the device
in question were not considered, for obvious reasons – in such cases,
the attacker can just replace the bootloader altogether anyway, and no
amount of fancy Rust code is going to save you there. The details of the
implementation as described in the article are definitely a little bit
over my head, but the gist seems to be that the project’s been able to
achieve a much more secure boot process without giving up much in
performance. This being a research project with an intentionally limited
scope does mean it’s most just something that’ll immediately benefit all
of us, but it’s these kinds of projects that can really push the state
of the art and try out the viability of new ideas.</p>

<h2 id="explainer-tim-walzs-long-track-record-in-china">Explainer: Tim
Walz’s long track record in China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Taipei, Taiwan  — From teaching at a high school in China to his
experience serving on a key congressional committee that focuses on
relations between Beijing and Washington, Democratic vice-presidential
nominee Tim Walz has a decades-long connection with China dating back to
the pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989.</p>
<p>As an educator, Walz taught American History, culture, and English to
Chinese students at the Foshan No.1 High School in the southern Chinese
province of Guangdong in 1989, the year that saw hundreds of thousands
of Chinese students protesting against the ruling Chinese Communist
Party in Tiananmen Square.</p>
<p>“China was coming, and that’s the reason that I went,” Walz said in a
2007 interview with The Hill, a Washington D.C.-based news website.
During his one-year teaching stint in China, Walz was nicknamed “Fields
of China” by his students due to his kindness.</p>
<p>His time in China had an impact on his perspectives of Chinese
people’s lives under the ruling Communist Party.</p>
<p>“If they had the proper leadership, there are no limits on what they
could accomplish,” he said in an interview with the Star Herald in 1990,
describing teaching in China as “one of the best things” he has ever
done.</p>
<p>His interest in China didn’t stop there. Upon returning to the United
States, Walz and his wife set up a company named “Educational Travel
Adventures” to coordinate summer trips to China for American high school
students.</p>
<p>Five years after the Tiananmen Square protests and the Chinese
government’s violent crackdown, Walz returned to China with his wife for
their honeymoon and they brought along two American high school tour
groups. Walz continued running the summer exchange program to China for
American students with his wife until 2003.</p>
<p>Advocating human rights in China</p>
<p>After becoming a member of Congress in 2007, Walz continued to focus
on issues related to China. During his time in Congress, Walz served on
the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which focuses
exclusively on human rights issues in the country.</p>
<p>Walz quickly established himself as a vocal critic of the Chinese
government, holding regular meetings with high-profile activists from
China and Hong Kong, including prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong
and Tibet’s spiritual leader Dalai Lama.</p>
<p>In an interview with VOA in 2014, Walz recounted his impression of
witnessing the student-led protest in Tiananmen Square unfold. “I
remembered waking up and seeing the news on June Fourth that the
unthinkable had happened,” he said.</p>
<p>While most Americans at the time decided to leave China due to
security concerns following the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, Walz
said he felt it was “more important than ever to go” to China because he
wanted to ensure that “the story was told” and let the Chinese people
know that the outside world was with them.</p>
<p>In addition to engaging with activists from China and Hong Kong, Walz
also co-sponsored several resolutions on key human rights issues in
China, including demanding the release of Chinese Nobel laureate Liu
Xiaobo and Chinese activist Huang Qi, as well as co-signing the Hong
Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act in 2017.</p>
<p>In one of his congressional remarks in 2016, Walz highlighted the
importance of having “constructive dialogues” with Beijing to ensure
“the preservation of traditional Tibetan culture and Tibet’s fragile
ecology.”</p>
<p>“The U.S. was founded on the ideas of universal freedom, and I
believe that we must continue to urge the Chinese government to provide
less regulated religious freedom to the Tibetans,” he said at the
time.</p>
<p>Foreign policy boost</p>
<p>In addition to being a vocal critique of China’s human rights record,
Walz also expressed concerns about China’s attempt to expand its
presence in the South China Sea in 2016, citing Beijing’s efforts to
build artificial islands in the disputed water as the reason to oppose
Washington’s attempt to reduce military spending.</p>
<p>Despite his strong stance on China’s human rights record and military
posture, Walz continued to stress the importance of maintaining
cooperation with China. “I don’t fall into the category that China
necessarily needs to be an adversarial relationship,” he said in a video
interview with Agri-Pulse Communications.</p>
<p>“I think we need to stand firm on what they are doing in the South
China Sea, but there [are] many areas of cooperation that we can work
on,” Walz added.</p>
<p>Some analysts say Walz’s deep connections to China and track record
in U.S.-China diplomacy could potentially help the Democratic
presidential pair make more informed decisions on foreign policy,
especially on issues related to China.</p>
<p>“I think [his emergence as Democratic vice-presidential nominee] is
going to put a lot of people who care a lot about American foreign
policy in this part of the world at ease, knowing that there is someone
on the ticket who is informed, has spent time in the region, and is not
starting from square one when it comes to learning about American
foreign policy in East Asia,” said Lev Nachman, a political scientist at
National Taiwan University.</p>
<p>He said since Walz has expressed many humanistic views of the Chinese
people, Tibetan people, and Hong Kongers, the Minnesota governor could
add more nuance to the policy debate related to China in the United
States.</p>
<p>“He may be able to articulate the need to push back against China’s
authoritarianism and human rights violations in different parts of the
world in a way that doesn’t vilify Chinese citizens or doesn’t lean
antagonistically in this overtly scare tactic rhetoric that I think a
lot of U.S.-China discourse has turned into in the U.S.,” Nachman told
VOA by phone.</p>

<h2 id="the-first-ira-tax-credit-data-is-in">The First IRA Tax Credit
Data Is In</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzEyNzgwNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MzMyOTEyMn0.3v8nbVscS_4KIAg5wwW9axh9jsaQL49QbQ0Jx9cAVbg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
More than 3 million American households used the Inflation Reduction
Act’s subsidies for homeowners last year, collectively saving more than
$8 billion on things like solar panels, batteries, heat pumps,
insulation, and other clean energy technologies and efficiency upgrades.
</p>
<p>
That’s according to new data released Wednesday by the Treasury
Department, which provided the most significant insight yet into how
Americans are actually using the IRA. Polling had so far suggested that
Americans were curious —
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-climate-legacy" target="_self"><u>if
confused</u></a> — about the law’s benefits, but until today, there was
no official data available to back up those impressions.
</p>
<p>
The data sheds light on usage of two tax credits in particular, one of
which encourages Americans to make energy efficient changes to their
home, e.g. installing a heat pump or a more efficient water heater, the
other of which goes toward installing rooftop solar or another form of
zero-carbon energy generation.
</p>
<p>
Of the more than 137 million tax returns the government had processed by
late May, some 3.4 million of them — or approximately 2.5% — took
advantage of at least one of these two subsidies. That’s about 30% more
people than used similar, though less generous tax credits in 2021.
</p>
<p>
“The Biden Harris administration’s top economic priority is making life
more affordable for Americans,” Wally Adeyemo, the deputy secretary of
the Treasury, said during a briefing call this week. “The Inflation
Reduction Act is doing exactly that.”
</p>
<p>
Not all of the data flatters the Biden administration’s goals, however.
The tax credits — especially those that reward energy-efficient home
upgrades — are used in large part by richer households who have the
money and wherewithal to pay for costly upgrades to their homes in the
first place. Here are four takeaways from this first crucial look into
how the law is going.
</p>
<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Americans are using the tax credits more than projected — but that’s
mostly because of the popularity of rooftop solar.
</h3>
<p>
More than 1.2 million Americans used the residential clean energy tax
credit, which covers some of the cost of installing clean
electricity-generating technology. A comfortable majority of those
claiming the credit — some 750,000 — purchased rooftop solar panels.
</p>
<p>
When the IRA was first proposed in 2022, the Joint Committee on Taxation
<a href="https://www.jct.gov/publications/2022/jcx-22-22/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>projected</u></a>
the government would spend $2 billion on the residential clean energy
credit in 2023. In fact, it has spent more than triple that — a total of
$6.3 billion and counting. The Biden administration expects more claims
to appear as tax returns keep rolling in through November.

</center>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Uptake is more about geography and economics than politics.
</h3>
<p>
The top three states claiming the efficiency tax credit were Maine, New
Hampshire, and Vermont. These states have some of the strongest state
energy efficiency policies in the country, according to the American
Council for an Energy Efficient Economy’s
<a href="https://www.aceee.org/press-release/2022/12/scorecard-leading-states-cutting-costs-residents-energy-efficiency-more" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>state
scorecard</u></a>, giving homeowners the chance to stack multiple
subsidies to help them pay for upgrades. Northeast states also have some
of the
<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/guides/utilities/electricity-rates-by-state/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>most
expensive electricity in the country</u></a>, and
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/heating-oil/use-of-heating-oil.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>many
homes there still use fuel oil heating systems</u></a>, the priciest
option for home heating.

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
But another set of states dominated the clean energy tax credits, which
cover solar panels. The top three states to use that subsidy were
Nevada, Florida, and Arizona — some of the sunniest places in the
country, which have
<a href="https://www.seia.org/sites/default/files/2023-03/SEIA_Top10_Solar_States_2022-YIR%20copy.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>long

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
Ironically, West Virginia — home of Senator Joe Manchin, one of the
IRA’s architects — was dead last of states that used at least one of the
credits.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The federal government helped pay for nearly 600,000 new natural
gas-burning heating systems.
</h3>
<p>
The Inflation Reduction Act revived an earlier, expired tax credit that
helped Americans pay for energy efficient home upgrades and appliances.
But while the new program increased the amount households could get back
for installing electric heat pumps from $500 to $2,000, it also kept in
place subsidies for “qualified” natural gas heaters. The government
helped pay for taxpayers to install nearly 600,000 new natural
gas-burning space heating and water heating systems in 2023. Those
appliances have a useful life of at least 15 to 20 years.
</p>
<center>
<iframe aria-label="Column Chart" data-external="1" frameborder="0" height="525" id="datawrapper-chart-7EZ8w" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7EZ8w/2/" style="border: none;" title="Lots of Americans saved on heat pumps ... but more saved on new natural gas appliances" width="680">
</iframe>
</center>
<p>
The level of uptake is not necessarily surprising — the upfront cost of
a natural gas boiler or furnace is much lower than that of a heat pump
system. In many states, natural gas heating systems will
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/heat-pumps-national-renewable-energ-lab" target="_self"><u>also
result in lower energy bills</u></a> than a heat pump will.
</p>
<p>
Heat pump water heaters are more competitive on cost than space heaters,
so there the mismatch may be more of a marketing issue. With the federal
tax credit, the upfront cost can be nearly on par with natural gas water
heaters, and they actually
<a href="https://www.energystar.gov/products/ask-the-experts/heat-pump-water-heater-right-your-home" target="_blank"><u>beat
their natural gas-powered brethren</u></a> when it comes to energy bill
savings.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Wealthier Americans were more likely to take advantage of the IRA.
</h3>
<p>
On a call with reporters on Tuesday, Adeyemo pointed out that nearly
half the families who claimed one or both of the residential clean
energy credits had incomes lower than $100,000 in 2023.
</p>
<p>
That’s true. But roughly 75% of filers had incomes lower than $100,000
in 2023. When you look at how many people claimed each tax credit as a
percentage of the total number of filers <em><em>in that
bracket</em></em>, it’s clear that both tax credits are more frequently
adopted by higher income Americans.
</p>
<p>
There’s also an interesting split between the two credits. Wealthier
households were especially enthusiastic about efficiency upgrades —
roughly one in 25 of those bringing in more than $100,000 claimed the
energy efficiency tax credit.
</p>
<center>
<iframe aria-label="Grouped Bars" data-external="1" frameborder="0" height="299" id="datawrapper-chart-SVVoP" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SVVoP/1/" style="border: none;" title="Wealthier households were more likely to use the tax credits ... especially on efficiency upgrades" width="680">
</iframe>
</center>
<p>
Adeyemo also pointed out that, since people invest in their home’s
heating system rather rarely, the administration expects uptake to
increase over time.
</p>
<p>
“Our expectation is that as more American families become more familiar
with these tax credits, and they look for ways to save money, they’ll
continue to see this as a means to do so,” he said. “Given what we’ve
heard from some of the companies selling these products, our expectation
is that this will continue.”

<h2 id="drones-warn-new-yorkers-about-storm-dangers">Drones warn New
Yorkers about storm dangers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Gone is the bullhorn. Instead, New York City emergency
management officials have turned high-tech, using drones to warn
residents about potential threatening weather.</p>
<p>With a buzzing sound in the background, a drone equipped with a
loudspeaker flies over homes warning people who live in basement or
ground-floor apartments about impending heavy rains.</p>
<p>“Be prepared to leave your location,” said the voice from the sky in
footage released Tuesday by the city’s emergency management agency. “If
flooding occurs, do not hesitate.”</p>
<p>About five teams with multiple drones each were deployed to specific
neighborhoods prone to flooding. Zach Iscol, the city’s emergency
management commissioner, said the messages were being relayed in
multiple languages. They were expected to continue until the weather
impacted the drone flights.</p>
<p>Flash floods have been deadly for New Yorkers living in basement
apartments, which can quickly fill up in a deluge. Eleven people drowned
in such homes in 2011 amid rain from the remnants of Hurricane Ida.</p>
<p>The drones are in addition to other forms of emergency messaging,
including social media, text alerts and a system that reaches more than
2,000 community-based organizations throughout the city that serve
senior citizens, people with disabilities and other groups.</p>
<p>“You know, we live in a bubble, and we have to meet people where they
are in notifications so they can be prepared,” New York City Mayor Eric
Adams said at a press briefing on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Adams is a self-described “tech geek” whose administration has tapped
drone technology to monitor large gatherings as well as to search for
sharks on beaches. Under his watch, the city’s police department also
briefly toyed with using a robot to patrol the Times Square subway
station, and it has sometimes deployed a robotic dog to dangerous
scenes, including the Manhattan parking garage that collapsed in
2023.</p>

id="families-of-americans-detained-in-china-seek-action-after-us-russia-swap">Families
of Americans detained in China seek action after US-Russia swap</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Harrison Li, the son of Kai Li, a Chinese American
wrongfully detained in China since 2016, felt a mix of emotions after
witnessing the recent return of Americans wrongfully imprisoned in
Russia.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, President Joe Biden and the families of those released
celebrated the return of three Americans and a permanent resident,
including two journalists and an activist, as part of the largest
prisoner exchange since the Soviet era.</p>
<p>Kai Li is one of at least three Americans wrongfully detained in
China. He was arrested in Shanghai in September 2016 and in 2018 was
sentenced to 10 years in prison for espionage, which he has consistently
denied. The other two wrongfully detained by China are Texas businessman
Mark Swidan and California pastor David Lin.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department does not disclose the number of wrongful
detention cases due to privacy concerns and the sensitivity of efforts
to secure the release of wrongfully detained U.S. nationals.</p>
<p>“U.S. citizens are not required to register their travel to a foreign
country with us, and we do not maintain comprehensive lists of U.S.
citizens residing overseas,” a State Department spokesperson told VOA in
an email when asked about the total number of wrongfully detained
Americans in China.</p>
<p>For the past eight years, Harrison Li has urged two consecutive U.S.
administrations to secure his father’s release.</p>
<p>“Our family is extremely pleased to see the return of Paul Whelan,
Alsu Kurmasheva, and Evan Gershkovich back to the U.S. and wish them and
their families the best in the long road to recovery,” Li told VOA in a
written statement.</p>
<p>“Once again, President Biden has shown his willingness to make
difficult decisions that prioritize the safety of Americans unjustly
detained abroad … except in China.”</p>
<p>Li expressed frustration over the lack of attention given to his
father’s case by the U.S. administration.</p>
<p>“All we can do is once again remind the President that my dad has
suffered unjustly for almost 8 years now, and that he must act to
‘finish the job’ before it’s too late,” Li wrote.</p>
<p>Several members of Congress are also urging the Biden administration
to secure the release of Americans wrongfully detained in China.</p>
<p>Congressman Michael McCaul, chairman of the Committee on Foreign
Affairs, told VOA that Americans wrongfully detained in China and
elsewhere deserve to be home with their families.</p>
<p>“One American wrongfully detained abroad is too many,” he said. “As
wrongfully detained Americans returned home this week from Russia, we
cannot forget about those held around the world, including those in
China — particularly Mark Swidan, Kai Li, and David Lin.”</p>
<p>Families call for urgent action</p>
<p>Katherine Swidan, the mother of Mark Swidan, revealed that her son
has been on a hunger strike for many days. He has been detained in China
since 2012 on narcotics trafficking charges, which he denies.</p>
<p>“Mark’s been on a hunger strike for 115 days. He’s lost a lot of
weight, and he’s been sick. His leg was swollen, and they did a very
sparse medical exam,” Swidan told VOA.</p>
<p>According to Swidan, U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns visited
her son in the past.</p>
<p>“When he went to see Mark, he told Mark the next time I come to see
you, hopefully it will be to bring you home,” Swidan said.</p>
<p>That message left both her and Mark full of hope, but Mark continues
to experience disappointment and anger and has had suicidal
tendencies.</p>
<p>“When I talked to him, he said he was in a room with, like, nine
other people, seven to nine people. He is doing gardening, planting
stuff. But he is furious because he doesn’t understand why they are not
pushing for him to come home,” she said.</p>
<p>Renewed focus</p>
<p>Peter Humphrey, a former British reporter in China, was arrested in
2013 and sentenced to two and a half years in prison for illegally
obtaining citizen information. He was released early in June 2015 due to
health reasons and was deported after medical treatment in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Now a nonresident researcher at Harvard University’s Fairbank Center
for China Studies, Humphrey uses his experience to assist foreign
citizens detained in China and help them contact government officials.
He says he has supported some American detainees whose cases remained
unreported for fear that publicity would make their situations
worse.</p>
<p>Humphrey believes that after last week’s U.S.-Russia prisoner
exchange, the United States should refocus its attention on Americans
improperly detained in China and elsewhere.</p>
<p>“These people are arbitrarily detained, and the American government
should wake up and understand the fact that it is their duty of care to
protect American citizens in China who become victims of this false and
cruel process of Chinese justice,” he told VOA. “Some talks are
happening but not like significant progress.”</p>
<p>Travel advisory</p>
<p>A U.S. State Department spokesperson said the department has no
higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens
overseas.</p>
<p>“Secretary Blinken, Ambassador Burns, and other senior U.S.
government officials continue to advocate for the immediate and
unconditional release of wrongfully detained U.S. citizens in meetings
with PRC officials,” the spokesperson told VOA. “The U.S. mission in
China will continue to offer consular services to every U.S. citizen
detained in the PRC.”</p>
<p>The Department of State travel advisory is at Level 3 for mainland
China, recommending that U.S. citizens reconsider travel due to
arbitrary enforcement of local laws, exit bans and the risk of wrongful
detentions.</p>
<p>“The sad facts are that the PRC has blocked U.S. citizens, including
college students, minors, businesspeople and tourists from leaving the
country. U.S. citizens have been wrongfully detained by the PRC, and the
PRC often arbitrarily enforces its own laws,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Family appeals</p>
<p>Nelson and Cynthia Wells, whose son Nelson Wells Jr. was detained in
China in 2014 and sentenced to life imprisonment for “drug smuggling”
(later commuted to 22 years), have written letters to three consecutive
U.S. presidents about their son’s imprisonment but have never received a
response.</p>
<p>“We also don’t know if they received the letters,” they said. “I
really believe that if we’re high-profile people, well, if we’re famous,
or we’re a top athlete, or we have a lot of money, or we have any type
of political connections, then we might get some recognition,” Nelson
Wells told VOA.</p>
<p>The case has drawn the attention of U.S. Senators John Kennedy and
Bill Cassidy, who are advocating for Nelson Wells Jr. to be recognized
as “wrongfully detained.” Last October, Nelson and Cynthia Wells spoke
with House Speaker Mike Johnson, who assured them he continues to
address the issue.</p>

id="musks-x-sues-advertisers-over-alleged-massive-advertiser-boycott">Musk’s
X sues advertisers over alleged ‘massive advertiser boycott’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>wichita falls, texas — Elon Musk’s social media platform X has sued a
group of advertisers, alleging that a “massive advertiser boycott”
deprived the company of billions of dollars in revenue and violated
antitrust laws.</p>
<p>The company formerly known as Twitter filed the lawsuit Tuesday in a
federal court in Texas against the World Federation of Advertisers and
member companies Unilever, Mars, CVS Health and Orsted.</p>
<p>It accused the advertising group’s brand safety initiative, called
the Global Alliance for Responsible Media, of helping to coordinate a
pause in advertising after Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion in late
2022 and overhauled its staff and policies.</p>
<p>Musk posted about the lawsuit on X on Tuesday, saying “now it is war”
after two years of being nice and “getting nothing but empty words.”</p>
<p>X CEO Linda Yaccarino said in a video announcement that the lawsuit
stemmed in part from evidence uncovered by the U.S. House Judiciary
Committee, which she said showed a “group of companies organized a
systematic illegal boycott” against X.</p>
<p>The Republican-led committee had a hearing last month looking at
whether current laws are “sufficient to deter anticompetitive collusion
in online advertising.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit’s allegations center on the early days of Musk’s Twitter
takeover and not a more recent dispute with advertisers that came a year
later.</p>
<p>In November 2023, about a year after Musk bought the company, a
number of advertisers began fleeing X over concerns about their ads
showing up next to pro-Nazi content and hate speech on the site in
general, with Musk inflaming tensions with his own posts endorsing an
antisemitic conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>Musk later said those fleeing advertisers were engaging in blackmail
and, using a profanity, essentially told them to go away.</p>
<p>The Belgium-based World Federation of Advertisers and representatives
for CVS, Orsted, Mars and Unilever didn’t immediately respond to
requests for comment Tuesday.</p>
<p>A top Unilever executive testified at last month’s congressional
hearing, defending the British consumer goods company’s practice of
choosing to put ads on platforms that won’t harm its brand.</p>
<p>“Unilever, and Unilever alone, controls our advertising spending,”
said prepared written remarks by Herrish Patel, president of Unilever
USA. “No platform has a right to our advertising dollar.”</p>

plot to kill US officials, politicians tied to Pakistani man</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — An Iranian plot to kill former U.S. President Donald
Trump appears to have centered on a Pakistani man with ties to Tehran
who hoped to also target other high-profile politicians and
officials.</p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday unsealed charges against
46-year-old Asif Merchant, saying he traveled to the U.S. this April in
search of hitmen willing to take on multiple jobs.</p>
<p>But according to the criminal complaint, the plot fizzled after the
person Merchant contacted in his effort to carry out the scheme reached
out to law enforcement.</p>
<p>“This dangerous murder-for-hire plot exposed in [Tuesday’s] complaint
allegedly was orchestrated by a Pakistani national with close ties to
Iran and is straight out of the Iranian playbook,” FBI Director
Christopher Wray said in a statement.</p>
<p>“A foreign-directed plot to kill a public official, or any U.S.
citizen, is a threat to our national security and will be met with the
full might and resources of the FBI,” he said.</p>
<p>The criminal complaint unsealed in New York does not identify any
specific target for Merchant’s plot, but the release comes just weeks
after U.S. officials said they had increased security for the former
president due to a threat linked to Tehran.</p>
<p>And the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said Tuesday
that the threats were one and the same.</p>
<p>“I was previously briefed concerning the Iranian threat and the
circumstances of Mr. Merchant’s arrest and questioned then-Secret
Service Director Kimberly Cheatle on whether she had reviewed the
intelligence concerning the Iranian threat,” Republican Representative
Mike Turner said in a statement.</p>
<p>“She confirmed to me that she read the intelligence and was aware of
this Iranian murder-for-hire plot,” Turner added, referring to a July 22
hearing on the failures to prevent an unrelated assassination attempt
against Trump on July 13 during a campaign rally in western
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s charges are the latest in a growing list of foiled plots
designed to kill Americans and other enemies of Iran on U.S. soil.</p>
<p>This past January, the U.S. charged three men, one of whom was based
in Iran, in a plot to murder two U.S. residents in the state of
Maryland.</p>
<p>The U.S. has also brought charges in plots targeting Masih Alinejad,
an Iranian American human rights activist and VOA Persian TV host and a
murder-for-hire scheme targeting former U.S. national security adviser
Ambassador John Bolton.</p>
<p>Many of the recent threats, including the ones targeting Bolton and
Trump, stem from Tehran’s desire to seek revenge for the Trump-ordered
January 2020 drone strike in Baghdad that killed Qassem Soleimani, the
leader of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force.</p>
<p>“We have said many times that we’ve been tracking Iranian threats
against former politicians. We’ve been very clear about that,” White
House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday.</p>
<p>“We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the
highest priority,” she said. “We have invested extraordinary resources
in developing additional information about these threats, disrupting
individuals involved in these threats, enhancing protective arrangements
and potential targets of these threats, engaging with foreign partners
and directly warning Iran.”</p>
<p>The court-appointed lawyer for the defendant in this latest plot
targeting Trump, and others, declined comment when contacted by VOA.</p>
<p>But the charging documents allege Merchant traveled from Pakistan to
Turkey and then to Houston, Texas, in April, after spending about two
weeks in Iran.</p>
<p>Once he landed in the U.S., the criminal complaint states, Merchant
immediately began recruiting individuals to assist him with the plan,
telling the informant that he could earn up to $100,000 and that the
scheme would target multiple individuals.</p>
<p>“[The] people who will be targeted are the ones who are hurting
Pakistan and the world, [the] Muslim world. These are not normal
people,” Merchant said, according to the charging documents.</p>
<p>Steal, plan, kill</p>
<p>During meetings in New York in June, Merchant allegedly sketched out
a three-part plan that involved stealing documents or computer files
from a target’s home, planning protests and then killing the targets on
U.S. soil.</p>
<p>Merchant is charged with giving two undercover agents posing as
hitmen a $5,000 advanced payment in late June to carry out the plot,
adding more money would be coming after he returned to Pakistan.</p>
<p>U.S. law enforcement officials arrested Merchant on July 12, before
he was able to leave the U.S.</p>
<p>“For years, the Justice Department has been working aggressively to
counter Iran’s brazen and unrelenting efforts to retaliate against
American public officials for the killing of Iranian General Soleimani,”
said Attorney General Merrick Garland in a statement Tuesday.</p>
<p>“The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold
accountable those who would seek to carry out Iran’s lethal
plotting.”</p>
<p>U.S. officials expect there will be no let-up in Tehran’s attempts to
get revenge.</p>
<p>“We need to recognize the brazenness of the Iranian regime,” the
FBI’s Wray told U.S. lawmakers during a hearing late last month. “I
expect we’re going to see more of it. I expect there will be more coming
on that.”</p>
<p>And some experts warn that even if some of the Iranian attempts
appear amateurish, they need to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>“Much like Iranian projectiles, sometimes quantity has a quality of
its own,” said Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the
Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies.</p>
<p>“On the one hand, some of these things may sound cartoonish or too
far-fetched, but on the other hand, there’s a persistence behind it,
which is worrisome,” he told VOA. “My fear is that it’s going to be
throwing everything or what it can at the wall and seeing what
sticks.”</p>

talks focus on China’s ‘coercive behavior,’ climate change</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON/SYDNEY — The United States and Australia kicked off
high-level talks Tuesday that will focus on China’s “coercive behavior,”
as well as the AUKUS nuclear submarine project, mounting tensions in the
Middle East and climate change, officials said.</p>
<p>The annual Australia-U.S. AUSMIN talks, taking place in Annapolis,
Maryland, include the top defense and diplomatic officials from both
nations.</p>
<p>“We’re working together today to tackle shared security challenges,
from coercive behavior by the PRC [People’s Republic of China], to
Russia’s war of choice against Ukraine, to the turmoil in the Middle
East,” U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said.</p>
<p>“And I know that [this] year’s AUSMIN will deliver results for both
of our peoples.”</p>
<p>The U.S. and China are at odds on a range of issues, including U.S.
support for Taiwan. Another topic will be Chinese military activity in
the South China Sea. China claims control over most of the sea,
including the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, where U.S. ally the
Philippines has maritime claims.</p>
<p>Austin spoke in the wake of a rocket strike on Monday in Iraq that
wounded seven U.S. personnel, as the Middle East braced for a possible
new wave of attacks by Iran and its allies following last week’s killing
of senior leaders of militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah.</p>
<p>Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Defense Minister Richard
Marles held meetings in Washington on Monday, a day before the AUSMIN
talks.</p>
<p>Marles highlighted the expanding role of a U.S. Marine rotational
force in northern Australia and defense industry cooperation.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing America’s force posture in Australia grow really
significantly. AUKUS is part of that, but it’s not the only part of
that,” Marles said in talks with Austin, according to a statement.</p>
<p>Under the AUKUS program, Washington will sell three nuclear-powered
submarines to Australia in the next decade. Wong said there was
bipartisan U.S. political support for the program.</p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador to Australia Caroline Kennedy told ABC Television
that China and climate change — priorities for the Pacific Islands,
where the U.S. and Australia are competing with China for security ties
— would be discussed.</p>
<p>“Obviously with China being such an important … trading partner and
competitor for both of us, that is obviously one of the main topics,”
she said.</p>
<p>“We are also talking about what we can do together to fight climate
change [and] to help the Pacific Islands to build critical
infrastructure to connect them,” she said.</p>
<p>As part of cooperating on environmental and resource issues,
Australia will spend $200 million ($130 million U.S.) to upgrade ground
station facilities in its remote central desert to process data from
NASA’s Landsat Next satellite.</p>
<p>Landsat Next is an earth observation program the U.S. space agency
says will provide early warnings on the onset of fires or ice melting.
The program is scheduled to be launched in 2030.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the satellite data would
also be used to target resource exploration in Australia, as the two
nations develop a supply chain for critical minerals.</p>
<p>The U.S. and its allies are seeking to reduce China’s market
dominance in rare earths and critical minerals used in electric vehicles
and defense technology.</p>

<h2 id="us-blames-iran-backed-militia-for-attack-on-air-base-in-iraq">US
blames Iran-backed militia for attack on air base in Iraq</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States accused an Iranian-backed militia of
carrying out a rocket attack on a U.S. air base in Iraq that injured
seven people, two of whom had to be evacuated for additional medical
treatment.</p>
<p>“We’re sure that it was an Iranian-backed Shia militia group,” U.S.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters Tuesday during a news
conference in Annapolis, Maryland, with Australian officials.</p>
<p>“Specifically which group, we’re still investigating,” he added.</p>
<p>U.S. officials had previously said two rockets slammed into the
al-Asad air base in western Iraq during Monday’s attack, wounding five
service members and two contractors.</p>
<p>Despite the need to evacuate two of the injured, officials said all
seven were in stable condition.</p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday, the Iraqi military said in a statement that it had
found the truck and rocket launcher used in the attack in the nearby
town of Haditha.</p>
<p>It also said it was getting closer to finding the perpetrators.</p>
<p>“They are currently being pursued to bring them to justice,” the
statement said.</p>
<p>The attack came as much of the region has been on edge, awaiting a
possible attack by Iran and its proxies against Israel in retaliation
for the killing of senior members of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and
Hamas terror groups.</p>
<p>Austin, though, declined to comment on media reports that Iran’s
reprisal might be imminent.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to speculate on any Iranian actions going forward,” he
said. “What I’ve been focused on is making sure that we’re doing
everything we can to put measures in place to protect our troops, and
also make sure that we’re in a good position to aid in the in the
defense of Israel if called upon to do that.”</p>
<p>Austin announced Friday that the Pentagon was sending additional
warships, an aircraft carrier strike group, and additional fighter jets
to the region to prepare for an Iranian attack, as well starting
preparations to send land-based missile defense capabilities, if
needed.</p>
<p>Speaking alongside Austin on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony
Blinken urged all parties in the region to seek calm.</p>
<p>“It is manifestly in the interests of everyone involved to avoid
escalation, to avoid the conflict spreading,” he told reporters.</p>
<p>“I believe that actually no one wants escalation, no one wants to see
the conflict spread,” Blinken added. “But it’s very important that no
one takes steps that could lead to that, even if it’s unintended.”</p>
<p>Some U.S. partners in the Middle East appear to be heeding that
call.</p>
<p>In its statement Tuesday, the Iraqi military condemned the rocket
attack on the al-Asad air base as irresponsible.</p>
<p>“We reject all reckless actions and practices targeting Iraqi bases,
diplomatic missions, and the whereabouts of the international
coalition’s advisers, and everything that would raise tension in the
region,” the Iraqi statement said.</p>
<p>Iraq hosts about 2,500 U.S. troops tasked with advising and assisting
Iraqi forces as they pursue the remnants of the Islamic State group,
also known as ISIS, or Daesh.</p>
<p>But Iraq is also home to numerous Iranian-backed militias, some of
which have been consulting with Tehran about the anticipated retaliation
against Israel.</p>
<p>Additionally, there has been periodic tension between Washington and
Baghdad.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Iraq have been engaged in recent, ongoing talks to
eventually end the anti-IS mission and transition to what officials have
described as a bilateral military partnership.</p>

id="pro-democracy-activist-convicted-in-us-of-giving-dissidents-intel-to-china">‘Pro-democracy
activist’ convicted in US of giving dissidents’ intel to China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — A Chinese American scholar was convicted Tuesday of U.S.
charges of using his reputation as a pro-democracy activist to gather
information on dissidents and feed it to his homeland’s government.</p>
<p>A federal jury in New York delivered the verdict in the case of
Shujun Wang, who helped found a pro-democracy group in the city.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said that at the behest of China’s main intelligence
agency, the Ministry of State Security, Wang lived a double life for
over a decade.</p>
<p>“The defendant pretended to be opposed to the Chinese government so
that he could get close to people who were actually opposed to the
Chinese government,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Ellen Sise said in an
opening statement last month. “And then, the defendant betrayed those
people, people who trusted him, by reporting information on them to
China.”</p>
<p>Wang was convicted of charges that include conspiring to act as a
foreign agent without notifying the attorney general. He had pleaded not
guilty.</p>
<p>A message seeking comment was sent to Wang’s attorneys.</p>
<p>Wang came to New York in 1994 to teach after doing so at a Chinese
university. He later became a U.S. citizen.</p>
<p>He helped found the Queens-based Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang Memorial
Foundation, named for two leaders of the Chinese Communist Party in the
1980s.</p>
<p>According to prosecutors, Wang composed emails — styled as “diaries”
— that recounted conversations, meetings and plans of various critics of
the Chinese government.</p>
<p>One message was about events commemorating the 1989 protests and
bloody crackdown in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, prosecutors said. Other
emails talked about people planning demonstrations during various visits
that Chinese President Xi Jinping made to the U.S.</p>
<p>Instead of sending the emails and creating a digital trail, Wang
saved them as drafts that Chinese intelligence officers could read by
logging in with a shared password, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>In other, encrypted messages, Wang relayed details of upcoming
pro-democracy events and plans to meet with a prominent Hong Kong
dissident while the latter was in the United States, according to an
indictment.</p>
<p>During a series of FBI interviews between 2017 and 2021, Wang
initially said he had no contacts with the Ministry of State Security,
but he later acknowledged on videotape that the intelligence agency
asked him to gather information on democracy advocates and that he
sometimes did, FBI agents testified.</p>
<p>But, they said, he claimed he didn’t provide anything valuable, just
information already in the public domain.</p>
<p>Wang’s lawyers portrayed him as a gregarious academic with nothing to
hide.</p>
<p>“In general, fair to say he was very open and talkative with you,
right?” defense attorney Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma asked an undercover
agent who approached Wang in 2021 under the guise of being affiliated
with the Chinese security ministry.</p>
<p>“He was,” said the agent, who testified under a pseudonym. He
recorded his conversation with Wang at the latter’s house in
Connecticut.</p>
<p>“Did he seem a little lonely?” Margulis-Ohnuma asked a bit later. The
agent said he didn’t recall.</p>
<p>Wang told agents his “diaries” were advertisements for the
foundation’s meetings or write-ups that he was publishing in newspapers,
according to testimony. He also suggested to the undercover agent that
publishing them would be a way to deflect any suspicion from U.S.
authorities.</p>
<p>Another agent, Garrett Igo, told jurors that when Wang found out in
2019 that investigators would search his phone for any contacts in the
Chinese government, he paused for a minute.</p>
<p>“And then he said, ‘Do anything. I don’t care,’” Igo recalled.</p>

to beef up regulations on fentanyl chemicals, White House says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — China said it would begin adding controls and regulation
to the production of three chemicals used to make illicit fentanyl, the
White House said on Tuesday, calling the move “a valuable step
forward.” </p>
<p>It is the third significant such action since the United States and
China resumed bilateral counter-narcotics cooperation in November 2023,
acting National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said in a
statement. </p>
<p>Illicit fentanyl remains a potent issue for U.S. President Joe Biden
and Vice President Kamala Harris, who has clinched the Democratic
nomination for the November 5 U.S. presidential election. Fentanyl
overdoses have surged to become the leading cause of death for Americans
between the ages of 18 and 45 and over 107,000 Americans died from drug
overdoses in 2023. </p>
<p>As part of an effort launched last year to thaw icy relations with
Chinese President Xi Jinping, Biden agreed to cooperate with Beijing on
counter-narcotics. </p>
<p>A delegation of senior Chinese officials met Biden administration
officials last Wednesday to continue conversations on increasing
controls on fentanyl chemicals and restricting financing for the drug
trade in China. </p>
<p>A U.S. congressional committee said in April that China was directly
subsidizing production of illicit fentanyl precursors for sale abroad
and fueling the U.S. opioid crisis, releasing findings from an
investigation it said unveiled Beijing’s incentives for the deadly
chemicals.</p>

id="wall-street-bounces-back-from-its-biggest-wipeout-in-almost-2-years">Wall
Street bounces back from its biggest wipeout in almost 2 years</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Stocks closed higher on Wall Street as calm returned to
the market a day after its biggest pullback in almost two years.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 rose 1% Tuesday, breaking a brutal three-day losing
streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.8%, and the Nasdaq
composite added 1%. Strong profit reports from Uber and other companies
helped support the market.</p>
<p>Most stocks climbed in a mirror opposite of the day before, when the
unraveling of some popular trades and worries about the U.S. economy
wracked markets. Treasury yields climbed, clawing back some of their
sharp drops since April.</p>
<p>Stronger-than-expected profit reports from several big U.S. companies
helped drive the market. Kenvue, the company behind Tylenol and
Band-Aids, jumped 14.5% after reporting a stronger profit than expected
thanks in part to higher prices for its products. Uber rolled 11.2%
higher after easily topping profit forecasts for the latest quarter.</p>
<p>Caterpillar climbed 3.8% after the maker of heavy machinery reported
stronger earnings than expected.</p>
<p>The whiplash moves for financial markets globally have been the
result of several technical factors, not just worries ignited by several
weaker-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy, in what strategists at
Barclays called “a perfect storm” for causing extreme market moves.</p>
<p>One is centered in Tokyo, where a favorite trade for hedge funds and
other investors began unraveling last week after the Bank of Japan made
borrowing more expensive by raising interest rates above virtually zero.
That scrambled trades where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at low
cost and invested the cash elsewhere around the world. The resulting
exits from those investments may have helped accelerate the declines for
markets around the world.</p>
<p>Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 10.2% Tuesday to claw back much of its
12.4% sell-off the day before, which was its worst since the Black
Monday crash of 1987. Stocks in Tokyo rebounded as the value of the
Japanese yen stabilized against the U.S. dollar following several days
of sharp gains.</p>
<p>“The speed, the magnitude and the shock factor clearly demonstrate”
how much of the moves were driven by how traders were positioned,
according to the strategists at Barclays led by Stefano Pascale and
Anshul Gupta. It wasn’t just worries about the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>Too soon to relax?</p>
<p>Still, some voices along Wall Street are continuing to urge
caution.</p>
<p>Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, is warning more
drops could be ahead because of a slowing U.S. economy and sticky
inflation. He’s forecasting both will be worse in the second half of
this year than what much of Wall Street expects.</p>
<p>The stock market’s “dip is not a blip,” he warned in a report, and
called it “too soon to jump back in.”</p>
<p>He had been predicting a coming correction in U.S. stock prices for a
while, including an acknowledgement in July that his initial call was
early. That was a couple days before the S&amp;P 500 set its latest
all-time high and then began sinking.</p>
<p>While fears are rising about a slowing U.S. economy, it is still
growing, and a recession is far from a certainty or even, as some
economists say, from a likelihood. The U.S. stock market is also still
up a healthy amount for the year so far, and the Federal Reserve says it
has ample room to cut interest rates to help the economy if the job
market weakens significantly.</p>
<p>S&amp;P 500</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year and
is still up more than 10% this year so far, in part because of a frenzy
around artificial-intelligence technology. Critics have been saying that
euphoria has sent stock prices too high in many cases.</p>
<p>They’ve pointed in particular to Nvidia, Apple and the other handful
of Big Tech stocks in the “Magnificent Seven” that were the main reason
the S&amp;P 500 set so many records this year. They helped overshadow
weakness across other areas of the stock market, which were struggling
under the weight of high interest rates.</p>
<p>A set of underwhelming profit reports recently, kicked off by Tesla
and Alphabet, added to the pessimism and dragged Big Tech stocks lower.
Nvidia dropped nearly 19% from the start of July through Monday on such
concerns, but it rose 5.8% Tuesday and was one of the strongest forces
pushing upward on the market.</p>
<p>Apple, though, slipped another 0.7% and was a heavy weight on the
market.</p>
<p>Bond market</p>
<p>In the bond market, Treasury yields climbed to claw back some of
their sharp drops since April, which were driven by rising expectations
for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.89% from 3.78% late
Monday. It had briefly dropped below 3.70% during Monday when fear in
the market was spiking and investors were speculating the Federal
Reserve could even have to call an emergency meeting to cut interest

<p class="drop-caps">
It’s official: Minnesota Governor Tim Walz
<a href="https://x.com/rudyfunkmeyer/status/1819093209991000413" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>got
the rose</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
On Tuesday morning, after days of frenzied speculation that floated
names including Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Arizona Senator
Mark Kelly, and Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Kamala Harris
<a href="https://x.com/KamalaHarris/status/1820828396298879294" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a>
that Walz’s name will be the one to underline hers on the presumptive
Democratic presidential ticket.
</p>
<p>
Many on the climate left will likely be thrilled by the pick: Of all the
finalists reportedly in contention for VP, Walz had the most impressive
clean energy and environmental accomplishments. An Army veteran and
former congressman of a rural, otherwise conservative Minnesota
district, Walz has a record of
<a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/timothy_walz/412214/report-card/2016#:~:text=Joined%20bipartisan%20bills%20the%209th%20most%20often%20compared%20to%20All%20Representatives" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>working
across party lines</u></a> to get things accomplished. In 2009, he
memorably
<a href="https://www.startribune.com/walz-defends-cap-and-trade-vote-says-bill-was-likely-to-change/99954784" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>voted</u></a>
for the doomed cap-and-trade bill and defended his position to
<a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2009/08/04/farmfest" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tough
crowds</u></a> of Midwestern farmers and ranchers.
</p>
<p>
Within
<a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/1060123097" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>months</u></a>
of being sworn in as Governor of Minnesota in 2019, Walz set a goal for
his state to get its electricity from 100% carbon-free sources by 2050.
At the time, only
<a href="https://www.cesa.org/projects/100-clean-energy-collaborative/guide/table-of-100-clean-energy-states/#:~:text=There%20are%20currently%2024%20states,including%20Puerto%20Rico%2C%20click%20here." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
few other states</u></a> had similar goals. “Climate change is an
existential threat. We must take immediate action,” Walz
<a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/03/04/walz-carbon-free-electricity-2050" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>argued
at the time</u></a>. “If Washington is not going to lead, Minnesota will
lead.”
</p>
<p>
By the time Walz signed
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/politics/minnesotas-new-climate-bill-is-ambitious-100-clean-energy-by-2040" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>actual
emissions legislation</u></a> into law last year, he’d set an even more
ambitious timeline — carbon-free electricity by <em><em>2040</em></em>.
The bill also streamlined permitting, set a minimum wage for employees
constructing large-scale utility projects, and included an environmental
justice provision to keep energy from waste incineration plants in
frontline communities from counting toward the 2040 goal. Minnesota
continued
“<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/politics/3-ways-minnesota-is-crushing-it-on-climate-action" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>crushing
it on climate action</u></a>” in the months that followed, with Walz
securing a $2 billion budget package that included grid improvements,
solar panels on state-owned buildings, an electric-vehicle rebate
program, heat pump grants and rebates, a green bank, and more. He also
signed a transportation bill to overhaul transit hubs, expand passenger
rail service, improve infrastructure, and offer electric bike credits.
</p>
<p>
And he hasn’t stopped. Earlier this summer, Walz
<a href="https://mn.gov/governor/newsroom/press-releases/?id=1055-638440" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced
a $200 million grant</u></a> to reduce food-related pollution, including
protecting and restoring carbon-absorbing peatlands, improving food
waste programs, and replacing gas-powered agricultural machinery with
trucks that run on electricity or clean fuel. The state is also
<a href="https://x.com/MarketUrbanism/status/1757427324734112164" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>considering
bills</u></a> that would

building </u></a><u>codes</u> to improve access to affordable housing —
an issue Walz has taken a personal interest in. Walz is also,
apparently, a

Walz’s
<a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/gov-walz-kicked-off-harris-campaigns-weird-attack-line" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>canny
communication skills</u></a> have already been much remarked upon, and
he’s openly recognized that many on the left struggle with
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/climate-inflation-poll" target="_self"><u>a
messaging problem</u></a> regarding climate change. “The surest way to
get people to buy in is to create a job that pays well in their
community,” the governor
<a href="https://time.com/7006717/tim-walz-kamala-harris-vp-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told</u><u><em><em>
Time</em></em></u><u>’s Justin Worland</u></a>. “All of us are going to
have to be better about our smart politics, about bringing people in.”
</p>
<p>
Walz’s record isn’t spotless, though. During his congressional career,
he earned a
<a href="https://scorecard.lcv.org/moc/tim-walz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>score
of just 75%</u></a> from the League of Conservation Voters. Earlier this
summer, a coalition of 16 environmental groups, including the local
Sierra Club chapter,
<a href="https://peoplenotpolluters.com/agency-failures" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>called
out Walz and his administration</u></a> for being too soft on
regulation, including state agencies’ reliance on farmers voluntarily
complying with
<a href="https://peoplenotpolluters.com/agency-failures/nitrate-pollution" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>nitrate
pollution limits</u></a>, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency’s
<a href="https://peoplenotpolluters.com/agency-failures/smith-foundry" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>failure</u></a>
to adequately police air quality violations from a foundry in a
low-income neighborhood, and what the group argued was
<a href="https://peoplenotpolluters.com/agency-failures/enbridge-line-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
flawed permitting process</u></a> for a crude oil pipeline built through
wetlands. North Dakota Republicans — including Governor Doug Burgum,
who’s been
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-cabinet" target="_self"><u>floated
for a potential Trump cabinet</u></a> — have
<a href="https://www.secureenergyfuture.org/post/e-e-news-burgum-says-unconstitutional-minn-climate-law-must-allow-ccs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pressured
Walz</u></a> to include carbon capture as a carbon-free energy
technology under the state’s emissions law (currently, decisions over
CCS and hydrogen are under the purview of Minnesota’s Public Utilities
Commission).
</p>
<p>
There’s also the small matter that Harris and Walz <em><em>have to
actually win</em></em> to be able to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/kamala-harris-climate-record" target="_self"><u>enact
any of their climate goals</u></a><em><em>. </em></em>At least on paper,
the math had looked slightly better for Pennsylvania Governor Shapiro,
who is an
<a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/josh-shapiro-approval-republicans-independents-20240513.html#:~:text=About%2057%25%20of%20Pennsylvanians%20strongly%20or%20somewhat%20approve%20of%20Shapiro%E2%80%99s%20leadership%2C" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>incredibly
popular governor</u></a> in
<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/08/02/josh-shapiro-harris-vp-running-mate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
must-win state</u></a>. “Minnesota is very unlikely to be the tipping
point state — less than a 1% chance,” Nate Silver
<a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/tim-walz-is-a-minnesota-nice-choice?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=1198116&post_id=147406197&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=5fio&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wrote</u></a>
Tuesday morning, arguing that Shapiro would have been a better pick
despite
<a href="https://jacobin.com/2024/08/josh-shapiro-harris-vice-president" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mounting
criticism</u></a> from progressives.
</p>
<p>
Within hours of the news, though, the climate left had already
enthusiastically circled around Walz. In a statement, Evergreen Action
Executive Director Lena Moffitt applauded Walz’s “masterclass in how to
govern in a way that meaningfully improves people’s lives and sets the
state up for a thriving future.” Cassidy DiPaola, the communications
director at Fossil Free Media and a spokesperson for the Make Polluters
Pay campaign, likewise acknowledged Walz’s progress on green issues,
nodding to his “evolution into a climate champion.” She added that Walz
has more than proven himself at the state level and that “his ability to
connect climate policy to the everyday concerns of Midwestern and rural
voters could prove invaluable in building broader support for climate
action.”
</p>
<p>
That, after all, will be the big question. Early voting for the next
president of the United States begins in 41 days.

<h2 id="its-not-partisanship-when-democracy-is-at-stake">It’s not
partisanship when democracy is at stake</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>
<img src="https://werd.io/file/66b23330c1a4638bb9020f12/thumb.jpg" alt="It's the stars and stripes, innit" width="1024" height="683">
</p>
<p>
This moment isn’t about partisanship, because the discussions we’re
having aren’t about tax policy or the intricacies of how we interact
overseas. In 2024, one candidate’s supporters are waving flags that read
“mass deportations now”, while the candidate is telling them they’ll
never need to vote in another election and calling for the termination
of parts of the Constitution. The other candidate, while we might
quibble about policy differences, is advocating for fairness and
inclusivity, and, you know, <em>continuing to have a democracy</em>.
</p>
<p>
So I don’t have any qualms about throwing myself in for Harris and Walz.
I would have voted for Biden and Harris, too, and probably also three
ferrets in a trenchcoat, as long as we were sure the ferrets didn’t
advocate for a white Christian nation. As it happens, I’m more aligned
with Harris and Walz than I have been with any Presidential candidate
maybe ever; certainly the last time I felt anything close to this
excitement was when Obama was running in the wake of eight disastrous
years under George W Bush. Even Obama was cautious on the campaign trail
and knocked back support for marriage equality, for example.
</p>
<p>
I’m particularly excited to see us move beyond the level of discourse
where we’re arguing about democracy vs not-democracy. Let’s get into the
intricacies of how we can help people without homes get back on their
feet, or to figure out how to help people buy their first houses; let’s
talk about literacy levels and how to move ourselves away from fossil
fuels without losing jobs and improving working conditions. A return to
a marketplace of genuine ideas rather than ideas vs unbridled id would
be an incredible step forward. I can’t <em>wait</em> to talk about tax
policy again.
</p>
<p>
And yeah, I’m looking forward to not thinking about That Guy, the folks
behind Project 2026, and their brand of nationalism for a good long
time. We need to move forward. We’re not going back.
</p>
<p>
The future could be much, much brighter than it has been for almost a
decade. Now we just have to win this thing.

<h2 id="wordstar-for-dos-7.0-archive">WordStar for DOS 7.0 archive</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>As you all know, I continue to use WordStar for DOS 7.0 as my
word-processing program. It was last updated in December 1992, and the
company that made it has been defunct for decades; the program is
abandonware. There was no proper archive of WordStar for DOS 7.0
available online, so I decided to create one. I’ve put weeks of work
into this. Included are not only full installs of the program (as well
as images of the installation disks), but also plug-and-play solutions
for running WordStar for DOS 7.0 under Windows, and also complete
full-text-searchable PDF versions of all seven manuals that came with
WordStar — over a thousand pages of documentation. ↫ Robert J. Sawyer
WordStar for DOS is definitely a bit of a known entity in our circles
for still being used by a number of world-famous authors. WordStar 4.0
is still being used by George R. R. Martin – assuming he’s still even
working on The Winds of Winter – and there must be some sort of reason
as to why it’s still so oddly popular. Thanks to this work by author
Robert J. Sawyer, accessing and using version 7 of WordStar for DOS is
now easier than ever. One of the reasons Sawyer set out to do this was
making sure that if he passes away, the people responsible for his
estate and works will have an easy way to access his writings. It’s
refreshing to see an author think ahead this far, and it will surely
help a ton of other people too, since there’s quite a few documents
lingering around using the WordStar format.</p>

id="slow-moving-tropical-storm-debby-bringing-torrential-rains-major-flood-threat-to-southeastern-us">Slow-moving
Tropical Storm Debby bringing torrential rains, major flood threat to
southeastern US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. — Tropical Storm Debby moved menacingly into
some of America’s most historic Southern cities and was expected to
bring prolonged downpours and flooding throughout the day Tuesday after
slamming into Florida and prompting the rescue of hundreds from flooded
homes.</p>
<p>Record-setting rain from the storm that killed at least five people
was causing flash flooding, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters)
possible in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said.</p>
<p>The storm’s center was over southeast Georgia early Tuesday with
maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (75 kph) and it was moving northeast
near 7 mph (11 kph). The center is expected to move off Georgia’s coast
later Tuesday. Some strengthening is forecast Wednesday and Thursday as
Debby drifts offshore, before it moves inland Thursday over South
Carolina.</p>
<p>“Hunker down,” Van Johnson, the mayor of Savannah, Georgia, told
residents in a social media livestream Monday night. “Expect that it
will be a rough day” on Tuesday, he said.</p>
<p>More than 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain had fallen through Monday
at Savannah’s airport, but more rain fell overnight and was continuing
Tuesday, the National Weather Service reported.</p>
<p>Flash flood warnings were issued in Savannah, Georgia, and
Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and
South Carolina. Both Savannah and Charleston announced curfews Monday
night into Tuesday.</p>
<p>In South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben
Webster called Debby a “historic and potentially unprecedented event”
three times in a 90-second briefing Monday.</p>
<p>In addition to the curfew, the city of Charleston’s emergency plan
includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents
can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that
shows which roads are closed due to flooding.</p>
<p>In Edisto Beach, South Carolina, a tornado touched down Monday night,
damaging trees, homes and taking down power lines, the Colleton County
Sheriff’s Office said on social media. No injuries were immediately
reported, officials said.</p>
<p>The weather service continued issuing tornado warnings well into
Monday night for parts of the state including Hilton Head Island.</p>
<p>At the edge of Hilton Head Island, musician Nick Poulin wasn’t overly
concerned about Debby since his equipment was inside and he made sure
that his car wasn’t parked under trees so it won’t be hit by falling
branches.</p>
<p>“I’m born and raised here, so we’ve had plenty of storms,” he said.
“It’s usually not as bad as people hype it up to be.”</p>
<p>Debby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a
Category 1 hurricane. It has weakened to a tropical storm and is moving
slowly, drenching and bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across
portions of eastern Georgia, the coastal plain of South Carolina and
southeast North Carolina through Wednesday.</p>
<p>About 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota,
Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police
Department said in a social media post. Just north of Sarasota,
officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were
rescued from flood waters.</p>
<p>“Essentially we’ve had twice the amount of the rain that was
predicted for us to have,” Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said
on social media.</p>
<p>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that the state could continue to see
threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.</p>
<p>“It is a very saturating, wet storm,” he said. “When they crest and
the water that’s going to come down from Georgia, it’s just something
that we’re going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for
the next week.”</p>
<p>Five people had died due to the storm as of Monday night, including a
truck driver on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of
his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over
the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff’s office
divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the
cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida
Highway Patrol.</p>
<p>A 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile
home southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County
Sheriff’s Office. In Dixie County, just east of where the storm made
landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash
on wet roads Sunday night.</p>
<p>In south Georgia, a 19-year-old man died Monday afternoon when a
large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution reported.</p>
<p>More than 140,000 customers remained without power in Florida and
Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from a peak of more than 350,000,
according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp. Nearly
12,000 more were without power in South Carolina early Tuesday. </p>
<p>More than 1,600 flights were also canceled nationwide on Monday and
more than 550 flights were canceled early Tuesday, many of them to and
from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden approved a request from South Carolina’s governor
for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a
similar request from Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he has asked
Biden to issue a preemptive federal emergency declaration to speed the
flow of federal aid to the state.</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris postponed a campaign stop scheduled for
Thursday in Savannah.</p>
<p>North Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy
Cooper declared it in an executive order signed Monday. Several areas
along the state’s coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington
and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping
Program.</p>
<p>North Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic
floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more
than $1 billion in damage.</p>
<p>In 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well
offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane
Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests.
Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set
rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and
was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South
Carolina.</p>

By now, there’s a decent chance that you’ve seen a Cybertruck out in the
wild — perhaps
<a href="https://transalt.org/blog/daylighting" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>blocking
the visibility at an intersection</u></a> or surrounded by gawkers in
the
<a href="https://x.com/PopCrave/status/1758492688746192964?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1758492688746192964%7Ctwgr%5E3795b9483f8c71cd14e09f3f32b9d902780e93f7%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ffuturism.com%2Fthe-byte%2Flady-gaga-grocery-store-tesla-cybertruck" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Whole
Foods parking lot</u></a>. And upon seeing it, I’ll bet you had
precisely one question:
</p>
<p>
<em><em>How does a Cybertruck function in rural Maine?</em></em>
</p>
<p>
Tucker Carlson is on the case. On Monday, the <em><em>Tucker on
X</em></em> host posted an hour-long video to determine whether a “man
with a real job” could replace his F-350 with a Cybertruck. I’ll be
honest: Out of respect for my time and sanity, I did not actually watch
<a href="https://x.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1820505150244413449" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
entire thing</u></a>. But within the first three minutes, Carlson’s
interview subject — a guy who’d been loaned a Cybertruck for all of five
days — confirmed that he could swap out his Ford for a Tesla with a
resounding “so far, yes.”
</p>
<p>
It was not the only unexpected Cybertruck endorsement of Monday,
however. On the other end of the Eastern Seaboard, at Mar-a-Lago, Donald
Trump appeared in his own
(<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/05/us/harris-trump-election/28b2cf31-0b30-5a9d-8508-97fe1bc2c2d9?smid=url-share" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>also

<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-adin-ross-stream-jake-paul-gen-z.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gamer
Adin Ross</u></a>. Over an hour into the livestream, Ross presented the
former president with a custom Cybertruck featuring a red, white, and
blue “Make America Great Again” wrap and the picture of Trump lifting
his fist in the air after the attempt on his life in Pennsylvania
emblazoned on its side. (In addition to
<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/adin-ross-trump-rolex-cybertruck-interview-1235074316/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>possibly
committing a campaign finance violation</u></a>, the pair also
inadvertently proved that the only thing more outré than owning a
Cybertruck is owning a Cybertruck <em><em>with your own face on
it</em></em>.)

For anyone who has followed
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-electric-vehicles-fact-check" target="_self"><u>the
Republican Party’s stance on EVs</u></a>, the fact that an all-electric
truck is now apparently being used to own the libs might cause your head
to explode. But on the other hand: <em><em>Of course it is</em></em>.
While the far right has for years pushed the idea that EVs are
<a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/pete-buttigieg-marjorie-greene-electric-cars-b2196087.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>somehow
emasculating</u></a>, Tesla designed the Cybertruck to be just the
opposite. It’s such a
<a href="https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/drew-magary-cybertruck-review-sf-19561381.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>conspicuously
masculine status symbol</u></a> that it provoked an anthropologist to
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/22/style/elon-musk-tesla-cybertruck.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wonder</u></a>
to <em><em>The New York Times</em></em> whether “I’ll ever see a nice
lady driving this kind of car.” The right’s change of heart on EVs (or
at least one EV) has also coincided
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-ev-pivot-elon-musk" target="_self"><u>neatly</u></a>
with Elon Musk’s announcement of a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-ev-pivot-elon-musk" target="_self"><u>new
conservative super PAC</u></a>. (Musk is credited as the supplier of the
loaner vehicle in Carlson’s video.)
</p>
<p>
But is it possible the right’s embrace of the Cybertruck could have
benefits beyond giving us amusing, if extremely long videos? The upside,
of course, is that the planet would be much better off if every person
who’d ever bought a gas-guzzling truck to project an image of
“<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/01/pickup-trucks-men-masculinity-rural-symbols/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rural
culture and manhood</u></a>” had decided to get an EV instead. Removing
political and cultural barriers to EVs <em><em>as a whole </em></em>is
certainly something to celebrate, even while
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-ev-pivot-elon-musk#:~:text=Tesla%20shares%20popped%204%25%20after%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20most%20recent%20comments%2C%20and%20the%20company%20is%20now%20big%20enough%20not%20to%20need%20the%20government%20subsidies%20that%20Trump%20would%20inevitably%20roll%20back.%20(Of%20course%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20a%20different%20story%20for%20Tesla%E2%80%99s%20rivals.)" target="_self"><u>the
exact motivations remain suspect</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
And hey, I won’t turn my nose up at more fast chargers in rural Maine.

<h2 id="toward-a-more-perfect-carbon-removal-standard">Toward a More
Perfect Carbon Removal Standard</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
There’s a new player in carbon removal. It’s not another startup
building machines to suck carbon from the air. And it’s not another
trade association or consulting firm or marketplace peddling carbon
removal credits. Instead, it wants to help establish a different system
for advancing carbon removal — one where the challenging but important
goal of scrubbing CO2 from the atmosphere is treated as a public good
and not just a business opportunity.
</p>
<p>
It’s called the Carbon Removal Standards Initiative, and it’s run by Anu
Khan, the former deputy director of science and innovation at Carbon180.
CRSI (pronounced like the Lannister queen in <em>Game of Thrones</em>,
“Cersei”) is a “financially unconflicted, independent nonprofit,” that
will provide technical assistance to policymakers, regulators, and
nongovernmental organizations in quantifying carbon removal outcomes.
</p>
<p>
A group providing technical assistance may not sound like a
revolutionary development. But Khan hopes CRSI will be a fulcrum around
which the entire industry can begin to pivot.
</p>
<p>
Today’s carbon removal industry is built on selling credits, each of
which is supposed to represent one ton of CO2 pulled out of the
atmosphere. But the market is almost entirely self-regulated. The
standards for measuring and reporting how much carbon a given project is
removing have either been developed by the carbon credit registries that
take a cut of the sales or by the developers themselves — in both cases
a conflict of interest, even if governed by the best of intentions.
Plus, there’s a
<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/14693062.2022.2094308" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>multitude
of standards</u></a> for every type of project, and they vary in
quality.
</p>
<p>
Take carbon farming, for example. If a farmer alters their practices to
increase the carbon stored in their soil, they can choose from more than
a dozen standards to quantify the effects. In theory, the standards all
produce an identical product — a fungible carbon credit equivalent to
one ton of carbon removed from the atmosphere. In reality, they
<a href="https://carbonplan.org/research/soil-protocols-explainer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>vary
widely in quality</u></a>, with some standards producing more accurate
results than others.
</p>
<p>
In watching this environment develop over the past several years, I’ve
often wondered if some independent, unbiased entity might eventually
step forward to enact one set of standards to rule them all. Khan told
me that about a year and a half ago, she had the same thought. “Oh, to
be so young,” she said.
</p>
<p>
At the time, there was growing concern that the carbon removal industry
would suffer from the same credibility issues that plagued the wider
market for carbon credits. “You have a multiplicity of these
verification entities driven by profit motives, some of which have very
loose standards,” Wil Burns, the co-executive director of the Institute
for Carbon Removal Law and Policy at American University, told me. “From
the standpoint of those purchasing credits or those viewing whether
companies are doing anything meaningful, nobody can really distinguish.”
</p>
<p>
In early 2023, dozens of carbon removal suppliers, buyers, verifiers,
academics, and nonprofit staff — including Khan — signed an
<a href="https://files.carbonplan.org/CDR-MRV-Standards-Letter-02-10-2023.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>open
letter</u></a> that now reads like an early draft of CRSI’s missions
statement. It called for the creation of “an independent, not-for-profit
initiative that conscientiously avoids conflicts of interest and has
funding that does not depend on issuing or selling carbon credits.” This
new body would “provide a trusted, scientific stamp of approval for CDR
protocols through an inclusive process to identify scientific
consensus.”
</p>
<p>
The letter focused on the issues with measuring carbon removal in the
context of the voluntary sale of carbon credits. But over the next year,
it became clear to Khan that carbon removal won’t reach the scale
necessary to make a dent in climate change without government policy.
“Even the market enthusiasts recognize that we’re going to need policy
as quickly as possible to shore this up,” she said, “and it’s going to
be policy, long term, that gets us to gigaton scale.”
</p>
<p>
So instead of providing “a trusted, scientific stamp of approval” to
private businesses, CRSI is laser focused on working with policymakers.
It’s not entirely clear yet what that will look like, and it’s likely to
evolve as CRSI finds its footing. But the group is launching with a few
projects that are already underway. It has created a database of
“quantification resources,” which is basically a list of all of the
methodologies published by companies, academics, government agencies,
and international standards organizations, for measuring different kinds
of carbon removal. It also has a database of carbon removal policies,
both those enacted and proposed. Eventually, Khan plans to have them
link out to each other, so you can see which standards underpin which
policies.
</p>
<p>
Khan wants CRSI to be a go-to resource for policymakers and agency staff
to ensure that carbon removal programs actually result in climate
benefits. “We are fundamentally a mission organization,” she told me.
“We believe that carbon removal is a tool for climate justice. Justice
requires accountability, and in carbon removal, that means knowing how
to count the carbon. We want to make sure that if we’re putting public
dollars into these policies, that they are backed by the ability to
actually measure the carbon.”
</p>
<p>
Khan isn’t the only one whose thinking on standards has shifted toward a
government-led approach. Burns, who also signed the letter, told me he’s
seeing more carbon removal companies pushing for a compliance market,
where the government requires polluting businesses to buy carbon
removal. “They would like to both have government standards that would
provide more confidence, for example, to investors,” he said, “and they
would like government mandates that generate more demand.”
</p>
<p>
Freya Chay is the program lead at the nonprofit Carbon Plan, which
spearheaded the letter. She told me many in the industry are now
thinking about carbon removal programs that don’t revolve around selling
credits at all, and therefore may have very different measurement and
verification needs.
</p>
<p>
One of CRSI’s first projects is an illustrative example. Imagine if the
Department of Agriculture developed a program to help farmers restore
the pH of soils that have gotten too acidic, by adding basalt — a
mineral that also happens to capture CO2 from the atmosphere as it
dissolves. Today, carbon removal companies that sell carbon credits
based on this process are taking hundreds of soil samples to measure the
outcomes. The USDA likely wouldn’t need that level of precision — the
captured CO2 is a co-benefit, not the entire point of the program — but
“at some point you probably do want to know if you removed carbon
through this policy,” said Khan. CRSI is working on
<a href="https://www.carbonremovalstandards.org/jurisdiction-level-monitoring-of-enhanced-weathering" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>figuring
out how you would do that</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, we might see the development of building codes that encourage
the use of
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/concrete-traps-co2-soaked-air-climate-friendly-test-2023-02-03/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>concrete
cured with CO2</u></a> from the atmosphere, or waste management
regulations that govern the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/vaulted-deep-carbon-removal" target="_self"><u>injection
of carbon-rich organic waste</u></a> into underground storage wells.
Bigger picture, the U.S. will eventually have to measure and report how
much carbon removal it’s doing across all of these little programs as
part of its obligation under the Paris Agreement.
</p>
<p>
In many of these cases, those setting the rules won’t be experts in
carbon removal science. “They’re going to need technical expertise,”
said Khan. “We want to make sure that when they are doing that work,
they have access to all of the relevant information, and that it’s
organized in a way that’s legible for the expertise that they already
have.”
</p>
<p>
Shuchi Talati, the former chief of staff in the office of fossil energy
and carbon management at the Department of Energy, told me that having
this kind of centralized resource would definitely have been useful.
“The private sector has a lot of power right now in setting standards
because the public sector doesn’t have the capacity,” she said. And
since the field is so diverse, efforts are spread across a bunch of
different agencies that don’t always talk to each other. Talati sits on
the board of CRSI, and for her, the focus on government is not just
about helping carbon removal scale.
</p>
<p>
“If we’re allowing the private sector to set standards and norms — and
maybe they’re fine right now — but if we continue to let that happen, I
can see the actual climate benefit of CDR slipping away,” Talati said.
“That’s really where I see Anu’s organization fit in, where we are
trying to set standards and norms from this core, foundational principle
of a public good.”

<h2 id="kamala-harris-is-now-democratic-presidential-nominee">Kamala
Harris is now Democratic presidential nominee</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris, a daughter of immigrants
who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to
become the first female vice president in U.S. history, formally secured
the Democratic presidential nomination on Monday — becoming the first
woman of color to lead a major party ticket.</p>
<p>More than four years after her first attempt at the presidency
collapsed, Harris’ coronation as her party’s standard-bearer caps a
tumultuous and frenetic period for Democrats prompted by President Joe
Biden’s disastrous June debate performance that shattered his own
supporters’ confidence in his reelection prospects and spurred
extraordinary intraparty warfare about whether he should stay in the
race.</p>
<p>Just as soon as Biden abruptly ended his candidacy, Harris and her
team worked rapidly to secure backing from the 1,976 party delegates
needed to clinch the nomination in a formal roll call vote. She reached
that marker at warp speed, with an Associated Press survey of delegates
nationwide showing she locked down the necessary commitments a mere 32
hours after Biden’s announcement.</p>
<p>Harris’ nomination became official after a five-day round of online
balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ended Monday
night, with the party saying in a statement released just before
midnight that 99% of delegates had cast their ballots for Harris. The
party had long contemplated the early virtual roll call to ensure Biden
would appear on the ballot in every state. It said it would next
formally certify the vote before holding a celebratory roll call at the
party’s convention later this month in Chicago.</p>
<p>An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll
conducted after Biden withdrew found 46% of Americans have a favorable
view of Harris, while a nearly identical share has an unfavorable view
of her. But more Democrats say they are satisfied with her candidacy
compared with that of Biden, energizing a party that had long been
resigned to the 81-year-old Biden being its nominee against former
President Donald Trump, a Republican they view as an existential
threat.</p>
<p>Already Harris has telegraphed that she doesn’t plan to veer much
from the themes and policies that framed Biden’s candidacy, such as
democracy, gun violence prevention and abortion rights. But her delivery
can be far fierier, particularly when she invokes her prosecutorial
background to lambast Trump and his 34 felony convictions for falsifying
business records in connection with a hush money scheme.</p>
<p>“Given that unique voice of a new generation, of a prosecutor and a
woman when fundamental rights, especially reproductive rights, are on
the line, it’s almost as if the stars have aligned for her at this
moment in history,” said Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California, who
was tapped to succeed Harris in the Senate when she became vice
president.</p>
<p>A splash in Washington before a collapse in the 2020 primaries</p>
<p>Kamala Devi Harris was born Oct. 20, 1964, in Oakland, California, to
Shyamala Gopalan, a breast cancer scientist who emigrated to the United
States from India when she was 19 years old, and Stanford University
emeritus professor Donald Harris, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally
from Jamaica. Her parents’ advocacy for civil rights gave her what she
described as a “stroller’s-eye view” of the movement.</p>
<p>She spent years as a prosecutor in the Bay Area before her elevation
as the state’s attorney general in 2010 and then election as U.S.
senator in 2016.</p>
<p>Harris arrived in Washington as a senator at the dawn of the volatile
Trump era, quickly establishing herself as a reliable liberal opponent
of the new president’s personnel and policies and fanning speculation
about a presidential bid of her own. Securing a spot on the coveted
Judiciary Committee gave her a national spotlight to interrogate
prominent Trump nominees, such as now-Supreme Court Justice Brett
Kavanaugh.</p>
<p>“I’m not able to be rushed this fast,” then-Attorney General Jeff
Sessions said during a 2017 hearing as Harris repeatedly pressed him on
potential conversations with Russian nationals. “It makes me
nervous.”</p>
<p>Harris launched her 2020 presidential campaign with much promise,
drawing parallels to former President Barack Obama and attracting more
than 20,000 people to a kickoff rally in her hometown. But Harris
withdrew from the primary race before the first nominating contest in
Iowa, plagued by staff dissent that spilled out into the open and an
inability to attract enough campaign cash.</p>
<p>Harris struggled to deliver a consistent pitch to Democratic voters
and wobbled on key issues such as health care. She suggested she backed
eliminating private insurance for a full government-run system —
“Medicare for All” coverage — before releasing her own health care plan
that preserved private insurance. Now, during her nascent general
election campaign, Harris has already reversed some of her earlier, more
liberal positions, such as a ban on fracking that she endorsed in
2019.</p>
<p>And while Harris tried to deploy her law enforcement background as an
asset in her 2020 presidential campaign, it never attracted enough
support in a party that couldn’t reconcile some of her past
tough-on-crime positions at a time of heightened focus on police
brutality.</p>
<p>Joining Biden’s team — and an evolution as vice president</p>
<p>Still, Harris was at the top of the vice presidential shortlist when
Biden was pondering his running mate, after his pledge in early 2020
that he would choose a Black woman as his No. 2. He was fond of Harris,
who had forged a close friendship with his now-deceased son Beau, who
had been Delaware’s attorney general when she was in that job for
California.</p>
<p>Her first months as vice president were far from smooth. Biden asked
her to lead the administration’s diplomatic efforts with Central America
on the root causes of migration to the United States, which triggered
attacks from Republicans on border security and remains a political
vulnerability. It didn’t help matters that Harris stumbled in big
interviews, such as in a 2021 sit-down with NBC News’ Lester Holt when
she responded dismissively that “I haven’t been to Europe” when the
anchor noted that she hadn’t visited the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>For her first two years, Harris also was often tethered to Washington
so she could break tie votes in the evenly divided Senate, which gave
Democrats landmark wins on the climate and health care but also
constrained opportunities for her to travel around the country and meet
voters.</p>
<p>Her visibility became far more prominent after the 2022 Supreme Court
ruling that dismantled Roe v. Wade, as she became the chief spokesperson
for the administration on abortion rights and was a more natural
messenger than Biden, a lifelong Catholic who had in the past favored
restrictions on the procedure. She is the first vice president to tour
an abortion clinic and speaks about reproductive rights in the broader
context of maternal health, especially for Black women.</p>
<p>Throughout her vice presidency, Harris has been careful to remain
loyal to Biden while emphasizing that she would be ready to step in if
needed. That dramatic transition began in late June after the first
debate between Biden and Trump, where the president’s stumbles were so
cataclysmic that he could never reverse the loss of confidence from
other Democrats.</p>
<p>Headed to the top of the ticket</p>
<p>After Biden ended his candidacy July 21, he quickly endorsed Harris.
And during the first two weeks of her 2024 presidential bid, enthusiasm
among the Democratic base surged, with donations pouring in, scores of
volunteers showing up at field offices and supporters swelling so much
in numbers that event organizers have had to swap venues.</p>
<p>The Harris campaign now believes it has a renewed opportunity to
compete in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia — states that
Biden had started to abandon in favor of shoring up the so-called “blue
wall” states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“The country is able to see the Kamala Harris that we all know,” said
Bakari Sellers, who was a national co-chair of her 2020 campaign. “We
really didn’t allow the country to see her” four years ago. Sellers
said: “We had her in bubble wrap. What people are seeing now is that
she’s real, she’s talented.”</p>
<p>Yet Democrats are anticipating that Harris’ political honeymoon will
wear off, and she is inevitably going to come under tougher scrutiny for
Biden administration positions, the state of the economy and volatile
situations abroad, particularly in the Middle East. Harris has also yet
to answer extended questions from journalists nor sit down for a formal
interview since she began her run.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign has been eager to define Harris as she continues
to introduce herself to voters nationwide, releasing an ad blaming her
for the high number of illegal crossings at the southern border during
the Biden administration and dubbing her “Failed. Weak. Dangerously
liberal.”</p>
<p>The Republican nominee’s supporters have also derisively branded
Harris as a diversity hire, while Trump himself has engaged in ugly
racial attacks of his own, wrongly asserting that Harris had in the past
only promoted her Indian heritage and only recently played up her Black
identity.</p>
<p>His remarks are previewing a season of racist and sexist claims
against the person who would be the first woman and the first person of
South Asian heritage in the presidency.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she
happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black,” Trump
said while addressing the annual convention of the National Association
of Black Journalists. “So, I don’t know, is she Indian or is she
Black?”</p>
<p>In her response, Harris called it “the same old show — the
divisiveness and the disrespect” and said voters “deserve better.”</p>
<p>“The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth, a leader
who does not respond with hostility and anger when confronted with the
facts,” Harris said at a Sigma Gamma Rho sorority gathering in Houston.
“We deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide
us.”</p>

id="ex-trump-attorney-to-cooperate-in-arizona-fake-electors-case-charges-to-be-dropped">Ex-Trump
attorney to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be
dropped</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>phoenix — Former President Donald Trump’s campaign attorney Jenna
Ellis, who worked closely with Rudy Giuliani, will cooperate with
Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in
a fake electors case, the state attorney general’s office announced
Monday.</p>
<p>Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and
conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people charged
in the case have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges — including
Giuliani, Trump presidential chief of staff Mark Meadows and 11
Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring Trump
had won Arizona.</p>
<p>“Her insights are invaluable and will greatly aid the State in
proving its case in court,” Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a
statement. “As I stated when the initial charges were announced, I will
not allow American democracy to be undermined — it is far too important.
Today’s announcement is a win for the rule of law.”</p>
<p>Last year, Ellis was charged in Georgia after she appeared with
Giuliani at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers
at the Georgia Capitol during which false allegations of election fraud
were made. She had pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of
aiding and abetting false statements and writings. The cooperation
agreement signed by Ellis in the Arizona case requires her to provide
truthful information to the Attorney General’s Office and testify
honestly in proceedings in any state or federal court. Prosecutors can
withdraw from the deal and refile charges if Ellis violates the
agreement.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have already asked a court to dismiss the Arizona charges
against Ellis. It wasn’t immediately clear if a judge had yet approved
the request.</p>
<p>The Associated Press left messages with Ellis’ attorney, Matthew
Brown, after the agreement was announced Monday.</p>
<p>While not a fake elector in Arizona, prosecutors say Ellis made false
claims of widespread election fraud in the state and six others,
encouraged the Arizona Legislature to change the outcome of the election
and encouraged then-Vice President Mike Pence to accept Arizona’s fake
elector votes.</p>
<p>The indictment said Ellis, Giuliani and other associates were at a
meeting at the Arizona Legislature on Dec. 1, 2020, with then-House
Speaker Rusty Bowers and other Republicans when Giuliani and his team
asked the speaker to hold a committee hearing on the election.</p>
<p>When Bowers asked for proof of election fraud, Giuliani said he had
proof but Ellis had advised that it was left back at a hotel room, the
indictment said. No proof was provided to Bowers.</p>
<p>Ellis also is barred from practicing law in Colorado for three years
after her guilty plea in Georgia.</p>
<p>Prosecutors in Michigan, Nevada, Georgia and Wisconsin have also
filed criminal charges related to the fake electors scheme.</p>
<p>Arizona authorities unveiled the felony charges in late April.
Overall, charges were brought against 11 Republicans who submitted a
document to Congress falsely declaring Trump had won Arizona, five
lawyers connected to the former president and two former Trump aides.
President Joe Biden won Arizona by 10,457 votes.</p>
<p>Trump himself was not charged in the Arizona case but was referred to
as an unindicted co-conspirator in the indictment.</p>
<p>The 11 people who claimed to be Arizona’s Republican electors met in
Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were “duly
elected and qualified” electors and asserting that Trump carried the
state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social
media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was
later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was
ignored.</p>

Mideast tensions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>THE WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Joe Biden met with his national
security team Monday and spoke with Jordan’s king to defuse heightened
tensions in the Middle East after a pair of high-profile assassinations
last week.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, warned Israel would
exact a “heavy price” if attacked by Iran or its proxies in the
region.</p>
<p>The White House said over the weekend that it was committed to a
hostage-release and cease-fire deal that had so far been elusive — but
emphasized that Washington stood ready to respond and had surged
military resources to the region.</p>
<p>“We still believe a cease-fire deal is the best way to bring this war
to an end,” John Kirby, White House national security spokesman, said.
“It’s also, we believe, very possible. We still believe the gaps are
narrow enough to close. The other thing that we’ve been doing since the
7th of October is making sure that not only Israel has what it needs to
defend itself, but that this war doesn’t escalate to become something
broader.”</p>
<p>Analysts say this is a tense moment.</p>
<p>“I think one of the reasons that this is also scary, to be honest,
for everybody, is that it isn’t clear what the United States can do when
we’re on the brink like this,” said Natasha Hall, a senior fellow with
the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies.</p>
<p>Advocates for the American Muslim community, which has criticized
Biden’s staunch support for Israel, say Washington should take a firm
line on Israel’s aggression in Gaza.</p>
<p>“The United States possesses a wide array of diplomatic and political
tools to hold Israel accountable, whether that’s withholding aid,
ammunition, weapons, political support or sanctioning more of Israel’s
far-right settlers that have been engaged in violence,” said Robert
McCaw, Government Affairs Department director at the Council on
American-Islamic Relations.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said Israel is ready to meet challenges.</p>
<p>“Iran and its proxies seek to surround us with a stranglehold of
terror on seven fronts,” he said. “Their visible aggression is
insatiable, but Israel is not helpless. We are determined to stand
against them on every front, in every arena, far and near. Anyone who
murders our citizens, anyone who harms our country, will be held
accountable. He will pay a very heavy price.”</p>
<p>Jordan Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi recently paid a rare visit to
Tehran, and Biden on Monday spoke to Jordan’s King Abdullah II about
de-escalating tensions in the region.</p>
<p>Hall says diplomacy may be the best way forward.</p>
<p>“What he [Safadi] wanted to do was play essentially a mediating role
in much the same way that Qatar has been doing in recent months,” she
said. “Just speak to Iran, try to address their concerns, but also to be
essentially a conduit for the United States to ensure that there’s some
kind of open channel during these particularly scary times.</p>
<p>“And I think that that is more necessary than ever before, since the
United States does not directly speak to high-ranking Iranian officials.
And so, they are depending on these kinds of regional mediators,
probably more so than ever before,” Hall said.</p>
<p>So, with nearly 40,000 people dead, Gaza in ruins, and Lebanon and
Iran on high alert, the world is waiting to see what happens next.</p>
<p>A reporter asked Biden about one of the key players in the conflict
as he left church on Sunday.</p>
<p>“Do you think Iran will stand down, sir?” the reporter said.</p>
<p>“I hope so,” Biden replied. “I don’t know.”</p>

id="dow-drops-1000-points-japanese-stocks-plunge-as-markets-quake-worldwide">Dow
drops 1,000 points; Japanese stocks plunge as markets quake
worldwide</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — A scary Monday that started with a plunge abroad
reminiscent of 1987’s crash swept around the world and pummeled Wall
Street with more steep losses, as fears worsened about a slowing U.S.
economy.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 dropped 3% for its worst day in nearly two years. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average reeled by 1,033 points, or 2.6%, while the
Nasdaq composite slid 3.4% as Apple, Nvidia and other Big Tech companies
that used to be the stars of the stock market continued to wilt.</p>
<p>The drops were the latest in a global sell-off that began last week.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 helped begin Monday by plunging 12.4% for its worst
day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.</p>
<p>It was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday’s
report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much
more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the
U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it’s all raised fear
the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too
much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling
inflation.</p>
<p>Professional investors cautioned that some technical factors could be
amplifying the action in markets, and that the drops may be overdone,
but the losses were still neck-snapping. South Korea’s Kospi index
careened 8.8% lower, and bitcoin dropped below $54,000 from more than
$61,000 on Friday.</p>
<p>Even gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during
tumultuous times, slipped about 1%.</p>
<p>That’s in part because traders began wondering if the damage has been
so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an
emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The
yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for
the Fed, briefly sank below 3.70% during the morning from 3.88% late
Friday and from 5% in April. It later recovered and pulled back to
3.89%.</p>
<p>“The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big
rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,” said
Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “Those are
usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate
of 4.3% doesn’t really seem like an emergency.”</p>
<p>Of course, the U.S. economy is still growing, the U.S. stock market
is still up a healthy amount for the year and a recession is far from a
certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking
when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive
would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more
oxygen and hurt everyone.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a
recession within the next 12 months following Friday’s jobs report. But
he still sees only a 25% probability of that, up from 15%, in part
“because the data look fine overall” and he does not “see major
financial imbalances.”</p>
<p>Some of Wall Street’s recent declines may simply be air coming out of
a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in
part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology.</p>
<p>“Markets tend to move higher like they’re climbing stairs, and they
go down like they’re falling out a window,” according to JJ Kinahan, CEO
of IG North America. He chalks much of the recent worries to euphoria
around AI subsiding, with pressure rising on companies to show how AI is
turning into profits, and “a market that was ahead of itself.”</p>
<p>Treasury yields also pared their losses Monday after a report said
growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected.
Growth was led by arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along
with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for
Supply Management.</p>
<p>Still, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the
economy’s strength took sharp losses on the fears about a slowdown. The
small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 3.3%, washing out what
had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.</p>
<p>Making things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks tumbled as the
market’s most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel.
Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the
“Magnificent Seven” had propelled the S&amp;P 500 to record after record
this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of
the stock market.</p>
<p>But Big Tech’s momentum turned last month on worries investors had
taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are
becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports
that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism
and accelerated the declines.</p>
<p>All told, the S&amp;P 500 fell 160.23 points to 5,186.33. The Dow
sank 1,033.99 to 38,703.27, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 576.08 to
16,200.08.</p>

<a href="https://andypiper.co.uk/2024/08/04/a-re-introduction-to-my-blog/">Andy
Piper’s post</a>, and I like the way he’s taken a step back and
(re-)introduced himself. So I’ll try and do the same.
</p>
<p>
You can learn more about me <a href="https://about.werd.io">on my About
page</a> or on <a href="https://resume.werd.io">my narrative resumé</a>,
which collectively explain who I am and how I got here at length. Or at
least, they explain the professional version of me. So perhaps this
“about me” can be a little more personal.

<h3>
About Me
</h3>
<p>
I’m Ben Werdmuller. I’m in my mid-40s. My mother’s family are half
Russian Jews whose village was burned down in pogroms conducted by the
White Army, and half institutional east coast Americans who can be
traced back to the Mayflower. My dad’s are Indonesian, Swiss, and Dutch:
the Werdmuller von Elggs are a Swiss aristocratic family of textile
merchants who were involved in the Reformation, among other things. My
dad is one of the youngest survivors of Japanese concentration camps in
Indonesia.
</p>
<p>
We moved around a bit when I was a kid, but the closest thing I have to
a hometown is Oxford, England. These days I live in Greater
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, after twelve years or so in the San
Francisco Bay Area. I also lived in Edinburgh, Scotland, for close to a
decade.
</p>
<p>
I see the world through a strongly internationalist lens, am fiercely
pro-union and anti-war, love immigration, and believe in a strong Europe
as long as it is a force for inclusive democracy and peace. I mostly
align with progressive principles and emphatically reject the idea that
the political center is the most reasonable — particularly in America,
where the universal healthcare, gun control, and educational principles
that are just accepted in most of the rest of the developed world are
somehow considered to be incredibly left-wing.
</p>
<p>
I’ve lost five members of my family, including my mother, to a (so-far)
incurable, genetic telomere dysfunction. Although I’m grateful to not
have the genetic trait, I would gladly have exchanged it with them. It
doesn’t and must not define any of their lives, but it hangs over my
family. We’ve experienced a lot of loss in a short time and we miss them
all terribly.
</p>
<p>
I’ve <a href="https://resume.werd.io">founded a handful of startups</a>,
have been the first employee at a few more, and generally find myself in
CTO roles across smaller, growing organizations. A few years ago I took
a sharp career turn and started leading technology in non-profit
newsrooms, because I became more and more concerned about the state of
the world and wanted to be on the side of strengthening democracy. These
days I lead tech at <a href="https://propublica.org">ProPublica</a>. I
care a lot about supporting the fediverse and the
<a href="https://indieweb.org">indie web</a>, which I see as incredibly
liberating in a human way: they’re how the web should be.
</p>
<p>
I’m a lifelong <a href="https://www.doctorwho.tv/">Doctor Who</a> fan. I
remember watching
<a href="https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/Resurrection_of_the_Daleks_(TV_story)">the
Daleks chase Peter Davison’s Doctor</a> when I was very small, and I
still look forward to every new story.
<a href="https://medium.com/doctor-who/sofabeds-snuggling-and-the-blinovitch-limitation-effect-4a1a7dcfb196">I
wrote this story about the 50th anniversary</a>, eleven years ago now.
</p>
<p>
I care about using technology to make the world more informed and equal.
If we’re not doing that, what’s the point?

<h3>
About My Blog
</h3>
<p>
Over time my blog has transitioned from just being my indie space to
mostly talking about the intersection of tech and media. It’s led to
working interesting jobs and meeting interesting people. I don’t have a
ton of time to build new software or write longer work, but I’ve made
reflecting here an integral part of my life. Lately I’ve been thinking
about making it more personal again.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been blogging since 1998, which feels like a very long time ago,
but this particular space has been going since 2013. Prior to that, I
blogged at
<a href="https://benwerd.com/2013/05/31/werd-io-and-idno/">benwerd.com</a>,
which I keep online as an archive. My sites before that have been lost
to time but are probably still available on the Internet Archive.
</p>
<p>
This site runs on <a href="https://known.co">Known</a>. I write posts
using <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a>, and power the email

<p>
Every so often I ask readers here
<a href="https://airtable.com/app68RpySPG9rjHll/shroodj2nnni0ecCX">what
they’d like me to write and think about</a>. So I’ll ask you, too.

If you’re new here: glad to meet you! If you’re a long-time reader:
thanks for sticking around.

businesses hoping to expand in US face uncertainty, suspicion</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — It was billed as the “biggest ever economic development
project” in north Michigan when Governor Gretchen Whitmer in 2022
welcomed a Chinese lithium-ion battery company’s plan to build a $2.36
billion factory and bring a couple thousand jobs to Big Rapids. </p>
<p>Now the project by Gotion High-Tech is in the crosshairs of some U.S.
lawmakers and residents. </p>
<p>Leading the charge is Republican Representative John Moolenaar of
Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, who accuses
the Chinese company of having ties to forced labor and says he fears it
could spy for Beijing and work to extend China’s influence in the U.S.
heartland. Gotion rejects the accusations. </p>
<p>“I want to see this area have more jobs and investments, but we must
not welcome companies that are controlled by people who see us as the
enemy and we should not allow them to build here,” Moolenaar said at a
recent roundtable discussion in Michigan. </p>
<p>Lured by the large U.S. market, Chinese businesses are coming to the
United States with money, jobs and technology, only to find rising
suspicion at a time of an intensifying U.S.-China rivalry that has
spread into the business world. </p>
<p>U.S. wariness of China, coupled with Beijing’s desire to protect its
technological competitiveness, threatens to rupture ties between the
world’s two largest economies. That could hurt businesses, workers and
consumers, which some warn could undermine the economic foundation that
has helped stabilize relations. </p>
<p>“This is a lose-lose scenario for the two countries,” Zhiqun Zhu,
professor of political science and international relations at Bucknell
University, said in an email. “The main reason is U.S.-China rivalry,
and the U.S. government prioritizes ‘national security’ over economic
interests in dealing with China.” </p>
<p>Lizhi Liu, an assistant professor of business at Georgetown
University, said the trend, along with the decline of U.S. investments
in China, could hurt China-U.S. relations. </p>
<p>“Strong investment ties between the two nations are crucial not only
for economic reasons but also for security, as intertwined economic
interests reduce the likelihood of major conflicts or even war,” she
said. </p>
<p>But U.S. lawmakers believe the stakes are high. Senator Marco Rubio
said at a July hearing that China is not only a military and diplomatic
adversary for the U.S. but also a “technological, industrial and
commercial” opponent. </p>
<p>“The technological and industrial high ground has always been a
precursor of global power,” said Rubio, a Republican from Florida.  </p>
<p>The bipartisan House Select Committee on China has warned that
widespread adoption in the U.S. of technologies developed by China could
threaten long-term U.S. technological competitiveness. </p>
<p>U.S. public sentiment against Chinese investments began to build
during President Barack Obama’s administration, in a pushback against
globalization, and were amplified after President Donald Trump came into
office, said Yilang Feng, an assistant professor of business at
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who studies economic
nationalism and resistance to foreign direct investments in the
U.S. </p>
<p>“The scale has increased, so has the intensity,” Feng said. </p>
<p>As President Joe Biden’s administration seeks to revive American
manufacturing and boost U.S. technological capabilities, many
politicians believe Chinese companies should be kept out. </p>
<p>“Can you imagine working for an American company working tirelessly
to develop battery technology and then you find out that your tax
dollars are being used to subsidize a competitor from China?” Moolenaar
said as he campaigned against the Gotion project in his congressional
district in a state that is critical in the presidential election. </p>
<p>Whitmer’s office has declined to comment on the project. The Michigan
Economic Development Corporation told The Associated Press it has
received “bipartisan support at all levels” to move forward with the
project, which will create up to 2,350 jobs. </p>
<p>Residents of Green Charter Township, however, revolted against the
project over its Chinese connections last year when they removed five
officials who supported it in a recall election. </p>
<p>In Worcester, Massachusetts, the Chinese biotech company WuXi
Biologics paused construction of a large facility a few weeks after
lawmakers introduced a bill that would, over data security concerns, ban
U.S. entities receiving federal funds from doing business with several
China-linked companies, WuXi Biologics included. </p>
<p>John Ling, who has helped South Carolina and Georgia attract Chinese
businesses for nearly two decades, said geopolitics have been getting in
the way in recent years. Chinese companies are less likely to consider
South Carolina after the state senate last year approved a bill banning
Chinese citizens from buying property, even though the bill has yet to
clear the statehouse, Ling said. </p>
<p>Data by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis show the total
investments by China in the U.S. fell to just under $44 billion in 2023,
from a high point of $63 billion in 2017, although first-year
expenditures rose to $621 million in 2023, up from $531 million in 2022
but drastically down from the high of $27 billion in 2016. The figures
include acquisitions, new business establishments and expansions. </p>
<p>In 2022, Michigan beat out several other states in luring Gotion.
Keen to revive its manufacturing base, the state offered a package of
incentives, including $175 million in grants and the approval of a new
zone that could save the company $540 million. Local townships approved
tax abatements for Gotion to build a factory to make components for
electrical vehicle batteries. </p>
<p>In Green Charter Township, the new board dropped support for the
project and rescinded an agreement to extend water to the factory site,
only to be rebuked by a U.S. district judge. </p>
<p>The future of the plant remains uncertain, as Moolenaar is rallying
support for his bill that would prevent Gotion from receiving federal
subsidies. He accuses the company of using forced labor, after
congressional staff discovered links between the company and Xinjiang
Production Construction Corps., a paramilitary group sanctioned by the
U.S. Commerce Department for its involvement in China’s forced labor
practice. </p>
<p>Chuck Thelen, vice president of manufacturing of Gotion North
America, recently called the forced labor accusations “categorically
false and clearly intended to deceive.”</p>

<p>Several widely used scholarly systems are using ROR IDs to identify
and disambiguate funding organizations. In this post, we’ll give you a
glimpse of how and why these systems use ROR IDs as funder
