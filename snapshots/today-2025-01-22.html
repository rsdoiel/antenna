<p>“Okinawa Island, officially Okinawa Main Island, is the largest of
the Okinawa Islands and the Ryukyu (Nansei) Islands of Japan in the
Kyushu region. It is the smallest and least populated of the five main
islands of Japan. The island is approximately 106 kilometres (66 mi)
long, an average 11 kilometres (7 mi) wide, and has an area of 1,206.98
square kilometers (466.02 sq mi). It is roughly 640 kilometres (350 nmi;
400 mi) south of the main island of Kyushu and the rest of Japan. It is
500 km (270 nmi; 310 mi) northeast of Taiwan. The total population of
Okinawa Island is 1,384,762. The greater Naha area has roughly 800,000
residents, while the city itself has about 320,000 people. Naha is the
seat of Okinawa Prefecture on the southwestern part of Okinawa Island.
Okinawa has a humid subtropical climate.”</p>

town to meet everyone and get him snacks. He was very excited and we

<strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/releases/tag/0.9">llm-gemini
0.9</a></strong>
</p>
This new release of my <code>llm-gemini</code> plugin adds support for
two new experimental models:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>learnlm-1.5-pro-experimental</code> is “an experimental
task-specific model that has been trained to align with learning science
principles when following system instructions for teaching and learning
use cases” -
<a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/learnlm">more here</a>.
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21</code> is a brand new version
of the Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking model
<a href="https://twitter.com/demishassabis/status/1881844417746632910">released
today</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Latest version also includes code execution, a 1M token content window
&amp; a reduced likelihood of thought-answer contradictions.
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>The most exciting new feature though is support for
<a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/grounding">Google search
grounding</a>, where some Gemini models can execute Google searches as
part of answering a prompt. This feature can be enabled using the new
<code>-o google_search 1</code> option.</p>

share short demos of projects that they had built. The session lasted
just over an hour and featured demos from six different people.

We broadcast live on YouTube, but I’ve now edited the session into
separate videos. These are listed below, along with project summaries
and show notes for each presentation.

Tommy Hughes has been developing a whole array of LLM plugins, including
his
<a href="https://github.com/irthomasthomas/llm-plugin-generator">llm-plugin-generator</a>
which is a plugin that can help write new plugins!
</p>
<p>
He started by demonstrating
<a href="https://github.com/irthomasthomas/llm-model-gateway">llm-model-gateway</a>,
a plugin that adds a <code>llm serve</code> command which starts a
localhost server running an imitation of the OpenAI API against LLM

a plogin which can use a consortium of collaborating LLM models working
together to solve problems.

<blockquote>
<p>
The best way to prepare avocado toast involves selecting quality
ingredients and careful preparation. Start with a thick slice of good
quality bread, such as sourdough or whole grain. Toast it to your
preferred level of crispness. While the bread is toasting, prepare a
ripe avocado. Cut it in half, remove the pit, and scoop the flesh into a
bowl. Mash the avocado with a fork, leaving some chunks for texture.
Season with salt, black pepper, and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to
prevent browning. Optional additions include a touch of red pepper
flakes.
</p>
<p>
Once the toast is ready, let it cool slightly before spreading the
seasoned avocado evenly over it. Consider lightly rubbing a cut garlic
clove on the warm toast for an extra layer of flavor (optional).
</p>
<p>
Enhance your avocado toast with your favorite toppings. Popular choices
include: everything bagel seasoning, sliced tomatoes, radishes, a
poached or fried egg (for added protein), microgreens, smoked salmon
(for a more savory option), feta cheese crumbles, or a drizzle of hot
sauce. For a finishing touch, drizzle with high-quality olive oil and
sprinkle with sesame or chia seeds for added texture.
</p>
<p>
Consider dietary needs when choosing toppings. For example, those
following a low-carb diet might skip the tomatoes and opt for more
protein and healthy fats.
</p>
<p>
Finally, pay attention to presentation. Arrange the toppings neatly for
a visually appealing toast. Serve immediately to enjoy the fresh flavors
and crispy toast.

<p>It is tempting to tell an LLM, “Build me a CRUD API in FastAPI,” and
watch it do its thing. And sure, it’s amazing that: LLMs can very vague
requirements, and That we are able to “talk” to computers this way
However, this tend to very a very imperative and not so repetable
approach. This makes things “difficult” to predict and validate against
an expected outcome. It also makes difficult to test different LLMs on
the same task to validate correctness, speed and price.</p>

id="why-are-people-leaving-this-city-weve-made-impossible-to-live-in">Why
Are People Leaving This City We’ve Made Impossible to Live In?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: McSweeney’s Internet Tendency</p>
<p>
As city leaders, we’re stunned we’re losing thousands and thousands of
residents who say they can’t build a life here. We don’t understand why
they’re leaving, even after we’ve spent all our time in office making
this city absolutely inhospitable to working people.
</p>
<p>
The building block of a comfortable life is housing, so we’re surprised
to hear people struggle to find affordable homes. Maybe they’re not
considering all of their options. Perhaps they could move to a cheaper,
outer borough like the Bronx or Queens, or an outer-outer borough like
Long Island, or an outer-space borough like our new colony on Jupiter’s
moon Ganymede (six months’ rent required at signing).
</p>
<p>
Don’t limit yourself to movement on our three-dimensional plane. How
about time-traveling back to 1987 to buy a dilapidated brownstone and
then waiting forty years to cash out at the expense of the suckers who
made the bad decision to be born after you? After all, that’s what every
elected official did.
</p>
<p>
The families that can afford to stay here still whine, especially about
our transit system. We thought parents loved it; they can spend all day
hauling double strollers down rain-flooded stairs to the open kiln we
call a subway station in August. It’s hours of free, heatstroke-inducing
fun for the whole family, unless anyone in that family needs an
elevator. In that case, may I refer you to our new outpost on Jupiter’s
moon Ganymede? There are no elevators there either, but in space, no one
can hear you complain.
</p>
<p>
Also, we don’t know how people flee this city so quickly; they’re
certainly not doing it on our crumbling public transit.
</p>
<p>
Even the people who ride bicycles have problems. I don’t understand why
they can’t find secure bike parking. All of our city employees manage to
park their two-ton SUVs on sidewalks and in bike lanes. Surely, you can
squeeze your little pedal-toy thing between them.
</p>
<p>
Don’t even get us started on the walkers. Constant boohooing about
reckless drivers blowing through crosswalks. Is it a bad thing we offer
impromptu mobile parkour options for our residents? In other cities,
you’d pay top dollars to try and barrel-roll over a Chevy Tahoe, but
here, you can do it for free whenever you need a gallon of milk.
</p>
<p>
Everyone who leaves should think of the opportunities they’re denying
their children, whom they can’t afford to raise in our incredibly
expensive city. We’re home to the best education in the world, teaching
millions of kids it’s not about where you’re born or who your parents
are but who your parents know on an admissions committee (mine knew the
guy whose great-great-grandfather invented hats).
</p>
<p>
And they’re leaving even though we announced free preschool for all
kids. We didn’t follow through in any way, but it was a heck of an
announcement. Balloons, streamers, an <span class="caps">FBI</span> raid
in the middle of the press conference: It had it all (except an actual
plan).
</p>
<p>
Like we said, it’s expensive to live in this city. You may have to get
financially creative and cut back on some essentials, like Netflix
subscriptions or paying any of your taxes. It works great for our rich
friends; they have plenty of cash left over to donate to our campaigns.
</p>
<p>
These fleeing families talk a lot about “quality of life,” but not
enough people talk about shutting up and white-knuckling your way
through an arbitrarily more difficult existence in this playground for
the uber wealthy we’ve created. Could things be better? Shut up. Wait,
where are you going, and what exactly is a “Philadelphia”?
</p>
<p>
Progress is often slow and difficult to come by, especially when we’re
working so hard to stall it. The only thing left to do is keep moving
forward in our official government <span class="caps">SUV</span>, past
the noise, past this pedestrian-filled crosswalk, and past whatever is
under our front bumper, pleading, “Help me.”

<h2
id="i-am-a-disappointed-trump-voter-who-was-told-it-would-be-the-past-by-now">I
Am a Disappointed Trump Voter Who Was Told It Would Be the Past by
Now</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: McSweeney’s Internet Tendency</p>
<p>
Well, they say you should never trust a politician, and it seems I’ve
been duped.
</p>
<p>
For months before and since I cast my vote for Donald J. Trump—and yes,
I’m one of those people who really leans into the “J” for some reason—I
have been promised by every reliable source that change was finally
coming to America, after four years of the failed leadership of Joe
Biden and then the four years before that, which I can’t remember.
</p>
<p>
But it’s abundantly clear that the Trump presidency is delivering more
of the same. And it’s the bad kind of same that’s been happening lately,
not the good kind of same like from the good old days. When men could be
men, women could be women, and I didn’t have to go to work or pay for
anything because I was a child.
</p>
<p>
On issue after issue, we are being force-fed “now” when we were promised
“then.”
</p>
<p>
Take rising prices. On January 20, at noon sharp, I busted down the door
of my local grocery store like it was Black Friday—and after management
told me that the door would’ve opened automatically if I had waited two
more seconds, I was shocked by what I saw.
</p>
<p>
A dozen eggs still cost four dollars. So did a gallon of milk. And my
fifth-grade teacher, who I used to run into all the time there? Still
dead.
</p>
<p>
Something was wrong. I thought maybe these grocery workers were some
sort of uncontacted people who were living under the tragic illusion
that Joe Biden was still president. But no. They’re modern people. They
keep up with the news through Facebook, just like you and me. And yet,
they were acting as if there was no difference between the day Biden
left office and the day Trump took office.
</p>
<p>
Then there’s the male loneliness epidemic. The voices who talk to me in
my head—mostly Barstool hosts via my earbuds—convinced me that maybe
this terrible feeling of isolation they told me I was experiencing might
finally be a thing of the past. But even though I voted for the guy who
has spent decades betraying absolutely every single person in his life
as soon as they no longer suit his immediate needs, I still have no
friends.
</p>
<p>
I was also promised that my vote would bring an end to <span
class="caps">DEI</span>, ERGs, <span class="caps">CSR</span>, and <span
class="caps">LGBTQ</span>, leaving only real American letters like <span
class="caps">UFC</span> and <span class="caps">EIEIO</span>. And yet,
when I showed up to work this morning, not a single one of my female
co-workers had vanished in a puff of smoke. And also, they still won’t
let me smoke at work! What decade is this—not the 1950s?
</p>
<p>
Then I got home, turned on the TV, and found that the Washington
Commanders are still called the Washington Commanders? And they’re doing
crazy hot right now? And the couples in the commercials for my favorite
erectile dysfunction pills are still interracial? And they’re crazy hot
right now?
</p>
<p>
To let off some steam, I went to the globe store to see if I could get
my model globe replaced—now that the United States is acquiring
Greenland, Canada, Mexico, and Panama, and I imagine the UN would
probably throw in some random bonus ones, like Suriname. But the
disgruntled employee at the front desk insisted mine was up to date and
that none of those places are states yet—presumably because she’s one of
those deep-state operatives that the administration still hasn’t gotten
around to axing.
</p>
<p>
Now, to be fair, Donald Trump has kept some promises. He brought back
TikTok. And he did it so effectively that it happened on the last guy’s
watch.
</p>
<p>
But everything else about his presidency thus far implies that Donald
Trump is the same guy he was eight years ago, doomed to disappoint as
compared to the extravagantly transformative promises he has made. That
even he is subject to political gravity and the constraints, however
loosened, of the Constitution.
</p>
<p>
And if that’s the case, let me draw a clear line in the sand: I will not
be voting for him in 2028.

Is what you’re doing taking a large amount of text and asking the LLM to
convert it into a smaller amount of text? Then it’s probably going to be
great at it. If you’re asking it to convert into a roughly equal amount
of text it will be so-so. If you’re asking it to create more text than
you gave it, forget about it.

<p>TL;DR: Enterprise AI teams are discovering that purely agentic
approaches (dynamically chaining LLM calls) don’t deliver the
reliability needed for production systems. The prompt-and-pray
model—where business logic lives entirely in prompts—creates systems
that are unreliable, inefficient, and impossible to maintain at scale. A
shift toward structured automation, which separates conversational
ability from business logic execution, […]</p>

<h2 id="welcome-home-president-nyarlathotep">Welcome Home, President
Nyarlathotep</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: McSweeney’s Internet Tendency</p>
<p>
Please allow me to take your umbrella,
<a href="https://www.mcsweeneys.net/columns/the-dread-lord-nyarlathotep-presidential-library">Dread
Lord</a>. My advisors informed me this morning during my final daily
presidential briefing that Hell had frozen over in honor of your return.
They certainly made their decision frigidly clear, by golly. I’m happy
the Capitol One Arena could accommodate the final details of your
resummoning ritual on such short notice. The intestinal pedestal erected
so the guests of honor from TikTok, Meta, Amazon, and SpaceX can
properly show fealty by licking your pustuled tentacle was a
particularly nice touch.
</p>
<p>
I know we do not see eye-to-eye sockets on most things. As President
these past four years, I repeatedly
<a href="https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/well-we-gave-nyarlathotep-a-chance-and-he-gave-us-four-years-of-horror-but-its-time-to-move-on-as-a-nation">tried
to remind the nation</a> about the unequivocal evidence that you are not
a “rational human being” in any traditional sense of the term but rather
an Outer God of Chaos devoid of any semblance of conscience, humility,
or even sentient logic. You, meanwhile, cursed my family with bile
plagues, plotted retribution from your Shadow Palace at Mar-a-Lago, and
raged incoherently from some surreal psychic plane known in the common
tongue as Truth Social. You also somehow managed to eternally infect
millions of American minds with false visions of nightmarish and
imaginary foes, bird-murdering windmills, and cheap eggs.
</p>
<p>
But never mind that you’re a convicted necromancer with a paper trail
linking you to every conceivable atrocity, crime against natural law,
and humiliating deviance. The country made its voice loud and clear last
November—and by “loud and clear,” I mean less than 23 percent of the
nation’s total population.
</p>
<p>
So it goes. The gears of this Great Nation grind on, no matter who or
how many people beg us to stop and reconsider. My only responsibility
today is to pass the torch that will help illuminate a new era that’s
somehow more hauntingly grotesque, bleak, and horrifying than your
first.
</p>
<p>
Some say I, in my tenure as Commander-in-Chief, could have helped
silence the trumpets that began heralding your apocalyptic return from
nearly the moment I assumed the presidency. Critics in my own party say
I should have encased the Necronomicon in tetanus-riddled barbed wire
and used one of Elon’s rockets to jettison it into the sun. Or, perhaps,
I should have properly outfitted the country’s already problematically
powerful Witchfinder Generals to root out your mindless goblin horde
that stormed the Capitol in a last-ditch effort to appease you. I was
even informed there is some pretty clear language in the Constitution’s
tattered remnants that explicitly lay out a simple legal spell to banish
you back to the Salted Plains of Mar-a-Lago for the rest of your
unnatural life.
</p>
<p>
To which I say: Look, it really was more a top-to-bottom failure of
every conceivable institutional safeguard that brought us here. Maybe
even a fatal flaw in capitalism’s occultic fabric that inevitably
metastasizes humanity’s worse inclinations. I’m just spitballing, but
maybe American worship of wealth exacerbates these baser tendencies
toward a societal breaking point. And, once broken, that rending in
reality charts a direct path for a Stalker Among the Stars such as
yourself into the Oval Office
</p>
<p>
I’m just saying, they can’t really lay it all at my feet, alright? I’m
sure you and I can at least agree on that. Well, that and
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/biden-pardons-family.html">pardoning</a>
our respective progeny.
</p>
<p>
But at the end of the day, I suppose I don’t care what the political
historians, marginalized constituents, fearful targets of your ire,
experts in the arcane, or my own tired eyes tried to tell me. For
reasons I have never been able to articulate convincingly, I believe the
American Democratic Experiment is greater than any one vindictive and
insatiable Elder God.
</p>
<p>
I know you campaigned on a renewed platform of “I See All, And It Shall
Burn.” I know innumerable cretins, nihilists, billionaires, and crypto
bros are at the gates, salivating at the Body Politic’s final,
shuddering gasps. But it’s either this or permitting Americans to
realize the truth: Humanity is still capable of conjuring its own
protective communities—and that scares the shit out of feckless
politicians, soul-shirking opportunists, and maybe even Outer Gods.
</p>
<p>
But if my hunch is correct—and hey, there’s a first time for
everything—we should be good to go. So, before I escort you into the
Inauguration Day Fealty Orgy, let me be the first to say: Welcome home,
Dread Lord Nyarlathotep.
