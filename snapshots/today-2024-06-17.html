Wall Street investors bet on extra rate cuts this year, in spite of Fed

Coach USA has filed for bankruptcy after ridership dropped during the
pandemic and failed to recover. And for Baltimore firms, work on the

down</a> and laying off all its remaining employees, citing a lack of
demand for the voluntary carbon market. The Portland-based company was
founded in 2017. Its technology involved sinking biomass to speed up the
ocean’s CO2-capturing capabilities, and with 25,000 tons of carbon
dioxide removed and 21,000 credits delivered, it was “the largest
company in the world to trap carbon without taking it directly from the
air or point of emission,” the <em><em>Portland Press Herald</em></em>

In March of last year, Running Tide signed a deal with Microsoft to
remove 12,000 tons of CO2e over two years. Shopify was also a partner.
But the startup began laying off employees in November after offset
prices began to plummet and questions arose about the environmental
benefits of the voluntary carbon market. CEO Marty Odlin told the
<em><em>Press Herald </em></em>that a lack of investment from the U.S.
government also stunted the company’s growth. “This was still at
research scale,” he said. “This needs to be a thousand times larger at
industrial scale and it’s going to take a ton of government leadership
to get us there.”

new study</a> published in the journal <em><em>Science of the Total
Environment</em></em>. The researchers used machine learning models to
analyze data from more than 24,000 surveys of firefly behavior and rank
the importance of certain risk factors (like pesticides, light
pollution, land cover, topography, and weather/climate patterns) on the
insects’ populations. Their results point to more frequent hot days as
one of the most “predictive” variables, meaning that firefly populations
seem more vulnerable to changes in climate than to other factors like
chemical sprays or artificial light. The researchers say that, “given
the significant impact that climactic and weather conditions have on
firefly abundance, there is a strong likelihood that firefly populations
will be influenced by climate change, with some regions becoming higher
quality and supporting larger firefly populations, and others
potentially losing populations altogether.”

<li>EU approves ‘Nature Restoration Law’

<p>
The European Union this morning
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-countries-approve-landmark-nature-law-after-delays-2024-06-17/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-82MIkb3Cii-EjtDvAtWl41rvnPztdp42We_Qxf2hCbiJQllzt-fge7DWq4_Z2u0epZsPgU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">approved</a>
a landmark environmental policy, paving the way for it to become law.

Restoration Law</a>” aims to restore ecosystems, bolster biodiversity,
and help the bloc achieve its climate objectives. More than 80% of
Europe’s habitats are in poor condition. The new law will require member
states to restore at least 20% of their land and seas by 2030, with the
aim of restoring all struggling ecosystems by 2050. Some countries
opposed the measure due to concerns it will slow the expansion of new
energy projects.

<p class="drop-caps">
Earlier this month, an odd little ad began appearing on TVs in Michigan.
On first watch, it plays like any other political advertisement you’d
see on television this time of year. In it, Michigan governor and Biden
surrogate Gretchen Whitmer touts the high-paying electric vehicle
manufacturing jobs that the Democratic administration has brought to her
state. Watch the spot a few times, though, and it soon becomes clear
what it’s missing.
</p>
<p>
Climate change.
</p>

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
The 30-second ad by Evergreen Action, an advocacy group linked to
Washington Governor Jay Inslee, promotes “electric cars that power our
economy and our future,” “training Michigan workers for high-paying
jobs,” and policies that are “good for our economy.” This is all clearly
referencing programs in the Inflation Reduction Act, arguably the most
significant piece of climate legislation ever enacted in the United
States, and yet the spot doesn’t once mention the one big upside all
these upsides have in common. According to
<a href="https://www.thirdway.org/memo/luxury-or-necessity-digging-into-clean-energy-and-climate-messaging-in-the-2024-election" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>new
polling</u></a> that Third Way, a center-left think tank, shared
exclusively with Heatmap News, that’s a good thing.
</p>
<p>
“Climate, as a message, is not going to drive turnout,” Emily Becker,
the deputy director of communications for Third Way’s Climate and Energy
team, told me.
</p>
<p>
While most Americans believe the planet is warming due to human activity
and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/americans-overwhelmingly-want-u-s-to-do-more-on-climate-change-heatmap-poll-finds" target="_self"><u>overwhelmingly</u></a>
want the government to do something about it, “climate change” — at
least
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/climate-change-voting-elections" target="_self"><u>in
those words</u></a> — is almost never their <em><em>most
important</em></em> issue. According to
<a href="https://www.thirdway.org/polling/beyond-the-climate-voter-how-to-broaden-support-for-clean-energy-in-america" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>prior
polling</u></a> by Third Way and confirmed in issue polls run by
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/02/29/americans-top-policy-priority-for-2024-strengthening-the-economy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>firms
like Pew</u></a>, voters who say the economy is their No. 1 priority
make up a plurality of the electorate, while “climate-first” voters
represent a much smaller (and typically, whiter, older, and wealthier)
subsection.
</p>
<p>
The new poll, conducted in mid-May and released on Monday, was done in
partnership with Impact Research, a progressive polling firm that
<a href="https://impactresearch.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>also
works directly with Biden</u></a>. What Third Way wanted was a better
understanding of when and where climate becomes a make-or-break issue.
The results show that just over half of Americans (54%) would back a
candidate who views clean energy as a priority. When presented with the
hypothetical of picking between a candidate who wants immediate climate
action and one who “feels we must address inflation before combating
climate change,” the numbers dip; just 40% of respondents said they’d
vote for the former candidate, and 47% picked the inflation-busting
latter.
</p>
<p>
Of course, this is a made-up scenario. For one thing, the clean energy
build-out
<a href="https://rmi.org/reality-check-the-green-inflation-myth/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>is</em></em></u><u>
inflation-busting</u></a>, and lest we forget, the 2024 election is
between a candidate who passed the most substantial climate legislation
in U.S. history and one
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change" target="_self"><u>who
still claims climate change is a hoax</u></a>. But inflation is
<em><em>the</em></em> heavy-weight issue in America right now. “People
are going to prioritize anything that impacts them personally,” Anat
Shenker-Osorio, a strategic communications consultant and the host of
the podcast <em><em>Words to Win By</em></em>, told me.
</p>
<p>
Shenker-Osorio said she interprets the candidate question as a
<em><em>victory</em></em> for climate advocates. Sure, when forced to
make a binary, zero-sum choice between climate and inflation, the
respondents to this poll chose the latter — but only by 7 points, and
with a margin of error of 3.1. Climate advocates have done an
“extraordinary job to bring voters into a place where they’re only 7
points underwater on this make-believe question, where somehow tackling
corporate price gouging and raising people’s wages can’t be done if we
are also tackling climate change,” Shenker-Osorio told me.
</p>
<p>
Shenker-Osorio did agree, however, that the word “climate” needs to be
used carefully, at risk of confusing or alienating voters. “I’m not
arguing that the winner here is to say ‘climate change’ over and over
and over again,” she said. “I also don’t use that in my messaging. It’s
way too abstract.” Shenker-Osorio pointed to phrases like “damage to our
climate” instead, and stressed to me that it is important for Democratic
candidates and their surrogates to “present a positive vision, which is:
the clean energy future is ours for the taking.”
</p>
<p>
Becker, of Third Way, acknowledged that the question presented a
blatantly artificial scenario, but argued that “using measures that can
be imperfect can still be revelatory in terms of how individuals think
about this issue.” For example, while emissions reduction is an obvious
upside of clean energy — it’s literally emphasized in the name! — the
polling confirmed that centering discussions of things like solar power
and EVs on the high-paying jobs and cost-saving upsides was more
productive than opining about saving the planet.
</p>
<p>
Finding the right balance might not seem too hard, but when you have a
30-second ad spot running in living rooms across Michigan, every single
word needs to be high impact. And manufacturing electric cars because
they “power our economy and our future?” <em><em>That’s</em></em> an
upside everyone can agree on.

id="spending-on-nuclear-weapons-hit-91.4-billion-in-2023-watchdog-finds">Spending
on nuclear weapons hit $91.4 billion in 2023, watchdog finds</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>GENEVA — The world’s nine nuclear-armed states together spent $91.4
billion last year, or nearly $3,000 per second, as they “continue to
modernize, and in some cases expand their arsenals,” according to a
report issued Monday by ICAN, the International Campaign to Abolish
Nuclear Weapons.</p>
<p>“This money is effectively being wasted given that the nuclear-armed
states agree that a nuclear war can never be won and should never be
fought,” Alicia Sanders-Zakre, co-author of the report, told journalists
in Geneva last week in advance of the report’s publication.</p>
<p>For example, she said, $91.4 billion a year “could pay for wind power
for more than 12 million homes to combat climate change or cover 27
percent of the global funding gap to fight climate change, protect
biodiversity and cut pollution.”</p>
<p>The report shows the nuclear-armed states spent $10.7 billion more on
nuclear weapons in 2023 compared with 2022, with the United States
accounting for 80% of that increase.</p>
<p>ICAN reports the United States spent $51.5 billion, “more than all
the other nuclear-armed countries put together.” It says the next
biggest spender was China at $11.8 billion with Russia spending the
third largest amount at $8.3 billion.</p>
<p>The report notes that the United Kingdom’s “spending was up
significantly for the second year in a row,” with a 17% increase to $8.1
billion, just behind Russia.</p>
<p>The combined total of the five other nuclear powers, France, India,
Israel, Pakistan, and North Korea, amounted to $11.6 billion last
year.</p>
<p>The authors of the report say companies involved in the production of
nuclear weapons received new contracts worth just less than $7.9 billion
in 2023. Analysis of data gathered over the past five years shows that
the nuclear-armed states collectively spent $387 billion on their
nuclear arsenals.</p>
<p>“There has been a notable upward trend in the amount of money devoted
to developing these most inhumane and destructive of weapons over the
past five years, which is now accelerating,” Sanders-Zakre said. “All
this money is not improving global security. In fact, it is threatening
people wherever they live.”</p>
<p>Arms control experts share these concerns and warn of the dangers of
a new arms race as the nuclear powers build up their arsenals in
defiance of the spirit of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons, which aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons
technology.</p>
<p>A report in the May issue of Foreign Affairs magazine cites
Washington’s concerns about China’s rapidly expanding nuclear arsenal.
According to Pentagon estimates, “Under Chinese President Xi Jinping,
Beijing is on track to amass 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030, up from
around 200 in 2019.”</p>
<p>A 2023 report by the Congressional Commission on the Strategic
Posture of the United States insists that China’s nuclear expansion
should prompt U.S. policymakers to “re-evaluate the size and composition
of the U.S. nuclear force.”</p>
<p>The commission also expressed disquiet at Russia’s increasingly
aggressive behavior, “including the unprecedented growth of its nuclear
forces, diversification and expansion of its theater-based nuclear
systems, the invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and subsequent full-scale
invasion in February 2022.”</p>
<p>International anxiety about an accidental or deliberate tactical
nuclear attack by Russia was on display this past weekend at the G7
summit in Italy and at the peace summit for Ukraine in Switzerland.</p>
<p>In their final communique, the G7 leaders condemned Russia’s “blatant
breach of international law” affirming that “in this context, threats by
Russia of nuclear weapons use, let alone any use of nuclear weapons by
Russia in the context of its war of aggression against Ukraine, would be
inadmissible.”</p>
<p>This sentiment was mirrored in a final declaration signed by most of
the 100 countries that attended the Ukrainian peace conference. Notable
holdouts included India, Indonesia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and South
Africa.</p>
<p>Referring to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, ICAN Executive Director
Melissa Parke warned, “This war has increased nuclear tensions between
Russia and the West to their highest level since the Cold War and there
is now a real threat of nuclear conflict as a result of Russia’s
numerous overt and tacit nuclear threats.”</p>
<p>ICAN’s report, which profiles 20 countries involved in the
production, maintenance and development of nuclear weapons, notes that
“Altogether there is $335 billion in outstanding contracts related to
nuclear weapons work.”</p>
<p>While the report shows significant growth in nuclear spending over
the last five years, Susi Snyder, ICAN’s program coordinator and report
co-author, observes “there also has been growth in global resistance to
these weapons of mass destruction.”</p>
<p>“The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons has signatures from
nearly 100 countries. One-hundred-eleven investors representing about $5
trillion in assets stated their support for the treaty,” she said.</p>
<p>“They demanded that more efforts be made to exclude the nuclear
weapons industry from their business until these countries stop doing
things prohibited by the treaty,” she said, noting the treaty is “a
clear pathway forward.”</p>
<p>“It is a way to reduce tensions, to condemn threats, and to stop this
new nuclear arms race that we have illustrated here before it surges any
further out of control,” she said.</p>

suspect in plot to kill Sikh separatist extradited to US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON/PRAGUE — An Indian man suspected by the U.S. of
involvement in an unsuccessful plot to kill a Sikh separatist on
American soil has been extradited to the United States from the Czech
Republic, the Czech justice minister said on Monday.</p>
<p>Nikhil Gupta has been accused by U.S. federal prosecutors of plotting
with an Indian government official to kill Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a
U.S. resident who advocated for a sovereign Sikh state in northern
India.</p>
<p>Gupta traveled to Prague from India last June and was arrested by
Czech authorities. Last month, a Czech court rejected his petition to
avoid being sent to the U.S., clearing the way for the Czech justice
minister to extradite him.</p>
<p>“On the basis of my decision on (June 3), the Indian citizen Nikhil
Gupta, who is suspected of conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire with
intent to cause death, was extradited to the U.S. on Friday (June 14)
for criminal prosecution,” Czech Justice Minister Pavel Blazek said on
social media platform X.</p>
<p>The comments confirmed an earlier Reuters story reporting on the
extradition that cited the federal Bureau of Prisons website and a
source familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>An inmate search by name on the Bureau of Prisons website showed on
Sunday that Gupta, 52, was being held at the Metropolitan Detention
Center, Brooklyn, a federal administrative detention facility.</p>
<p>A U.S. Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment. Gupta’s
U.S.-based lawyer, attorney Jeffrey Chabrowe, had no immediate
comment.</p>
<p>The discovery of alleged assassination plots against Sikh separatists
in the U.S. and Canada has tested relations with India, seen by Western
nations as a counter to China’s rising global influence. India’s
government denies involvement in such plots.</p>
<p>Canada said in September its intelligence agencies were pursuing
allegations linking India’s government to the murder of Sikh separatist
leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023 in Canada.</p>
<p>In November, U.S. authorities said an Indian government official had
directed the plot in the attempted murder of Pannun, who is a U.S. and
Canadian citizen. Gupta is accused of involvement in that plot.</p>
<p>Pannun told Reuters on Sunday that while the extradition was a
welcome step, “Nikhil Gupta is just a foot soldier.”</p>
<p>India’s government has dissociated itself from the plot against
Pannun, saying it was against government policy. It has said it would
formally investigate security concerns raised by Washington.</p>

Climate Finance Targets</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-17, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Goodhart’s Law
<a href="https://xkcd.com/2899/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tells
us</u></a> that “when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good
measure.” The disagreements climate diplomats were having last week
highlight why.
</p>
<p>
Last week, climate negotiators
<a href="https://www.wri.org/news/statement-limited-progress-bonn-climate-talks-new-climate-finance-goal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sparred</u></a>
in Bonn, Germany, over a
<a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/UNFCCC_NCQG2023_flyer_web.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>New
Collective Quantified Goal</u></a> on climate finance. The NCQG, as it’s
labeled, is a new target for how much money governments must mobilize to
meet global climate investment needs consistent with goals set down in
the United Nations’ landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. Reaching a consensus
on the NCQG is the biggest item on negotiators’ plates between Bonn and
COP29, the annual United Nations-led conference on climate change,
happening this fall in Baku, Azerbaijan. But, true to Goodhart, the
global climate targets negotiators are deadlocked over are not good
measurements of progress, let alone ones that development countries
measured up to.
</p>
<p>
In 2009, at COP15 in Copenhagen, developed countries set a goal of
mobilizing $100 billion annually for climate investments in developing
countries by 2020. In 2015, as part of the Paris Agreement, the world’s
climate diplomats agreed to set an updated goal — the NCQG — before
2025. In the interim, developed countries achieved their original goal,
although
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b9f24e37-9154-4fc4-b410-25f45782b8ba?accessToken=zwAAAY_Knhh7kdO58k43kVRPxNO0ECX0V4K4ug.MEUCIECxzS7oo99Pmk4dILtg5F_Uz71LPZgiPR0-HULIkUeVAiEA-d2jKr98m5VKGr3kZp2uk-3hg5R6-FTokbz4uv5aAb0&segmentId=e95a9ae7-622c-6235-5f87-51e412b47e97&shareType=enterprise&shareId=8bc2668e-a274-406a-b949-a91855175b7c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>years
later</u></a> than planned and amidst allegations that some of their
grants and loans were merely existing sources of development financing
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/16/rich-countries-hit-climate-finance-goal-two-years-late-data" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dressed
up</u></a> as climate finance. That there is
<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/faqs/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FAQ_Chapter_15.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>no
fixed definition</u></a> of the term “climate finance” makes the $100
billion target doubly
<a href="https://devinit.org/blog/do-we-need-common-definition-climate-finance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fuzzy</u></a>:
Upon closer inspection, some spending classified as climate finance
<a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2024/04/16/world-bank-climate-funding-greens-african-hotels-while-fishermen-sink/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>doesn’t</u></a>
really seem like it should count, while other spending seems to have
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/climate-change-loans/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>circled
back</u></a> to donor country governments, consultants, and nonprofits.
</p>
<p>
Despite these measurement issues, negotiators at Bonn pressed for an
ambitious updated target. There was consensus that the NCQG
<a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/UNFCCC_NCQG2023_flyer_web.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>could
not be less than</u></a> $100 billion annually — but that is where
agreement ended. While negotiators from developing countries ―
particularly those from
<a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2024/06/11/bonn-talks-on-climate-finance-goal-end-in-stalemate-on-numbers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>African
and Asian governments</u></a> ― called for an NCQG as high as
<a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2024/06/12/tensions-rise-as-nations-demand-1-4t-in-climate-aid-00162775" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$1.4
trillion annually</u></a> over the next five years, developed country
negotiators
<a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2024/06/12/bonn-bulletin-climate-finance-chasm-remains-unbridged/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>refused
to commit</u></a> to a figure, choosing instead to argue over which
countries should be expected to pay. Held up over this disagreement,
Bonn ended without a resolution even on what a range of possible NCQGs
could look like.
</p>
<p>
Whatever its size, this target means nothing without a plan to deliver
it. What’s more, the back-and-forth over the size of the bill and who
foots it took up so much time last week that two other long-standing
debates were neglected: The first over what type of financing the NCQG
should prioritize ― a measurement issue ― and the second about the
obstacles (or “disenablers,” as negotiators called them) in the way of
achieving that level of financing — a target issue.
</p>
<p>
As to the type of financing, the share of total official development
assistance sent from G7 governments and the European Union to African
countries is at its
<a href="https://data.one.org/data-dives/g7-aid-to-africa/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lowest</u></a>
in 50 years, making it possible to conclude,
<a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/bonn-climate-conference-2024-stage-set-for-new-climate-finance-goal-enroute-to-baku-96527" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>as
did an EU negotiator at Bonn</u></a>, that “public resources alone will
not suffice” to meet the NCQG. The growing scale of the climate
challenge, weighed against this apparent (if arguably
<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/09/14/foreign-aid-development-western-voters-governments/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>self-imposed</u></a>)
inadequate public spending by developed countries, has prompted
policymakers to
<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2023/06/22/world-bank-group-intensifies-focus-on-private-sector-launches-effort-to-scale-investment-in-emerging-markets" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>advocate</u></a>
for greater
<a href="https://unfccc.int/event/first-public-private-climate-finance-policy-dialogue" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>private-sector
involvement</u></a> in meeting global climate finance targets. The
United States in particular has
<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-road-to-baku-belem-and-beyond-a-5-year-outlook-for-u-s-international-climate-finance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>placed
heavy emphasis</u></a> on the need to “mobilize private capital.” This
agenda has prompted Global North governments and the
<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/unit/brief/private-sector-investment-lab" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>World
Bank</u></a> to attract private investors to decarbonization projects in
developing countries.
</p>
<p>
Developing country negotiators and civil society advocates, meanwhile,
have
<a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2023/06/26/dreaming-big-on-climate-action-means-finding-the-money-to-pay-for-it/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>long
criticized</u></a> the fact that the
<a href="https://www.cseindia.org/beyond-climate-finance-climate-ambition-in-the-global-south-requires-financial-system-reforms-11753" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>majority</u></a>
of the climate financing we know about has come in the form of loans and
not grants, and that most of the loans ― some of the ones from the
public sector and all of the private loans ― are issued on
<a href="https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Global-Landscape-of-Climate-Finance-2023.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>market-rate</u></a>
rather than “concessional” terms. In other words, all this so-called
help places an undue burden on the balance sheets of developing
countries, especially as global interest rates
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/fed-interest-rate-renewables" target="_self"><u>stay
high</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Some negotiators are looking to
<a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/video/climate-change/what-is-the-new-collective-quantified-goal-ncqg-on-climate-finance-and-why-is-it-so-important--95844" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>incorporate</u></a>
these arguments into the NCQG as a measure of the quality of the
financing developing countries receive. And this is where the
conversation around the obstacles begins.
</p>
<p>
One can argue that loans of any kind are better than nothing at all;
long-term investments require long-term debt financing. But market-rate
loans in the Global South carry prohibitively
<a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/227da10f-c527-406d-b94f-dbaa38ae9abb/ReducingtheCostofCapital.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>high
interest rates</u></a>, reflecting the greater risks that private
investors think they face when investing. The International Energy
Agency
<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/cost-of-capital-observatory/tools-and-analysis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>confirms</u></a>
that “the cost of capital for a typical solar PV plant in 2021 was
between two‐ and three‐times higher in emerging and developing economies
than in advanced economies and China.” While policymakers,
<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/unit/brief/private-sector-investment-lab" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>particularly
at the World Bank</u></a>, are developing tools to “derisk” these
investments such that they can be profitable at market interest rates,
it’s
<a href="https://advaitarun.wordpress.com/2024/03/25/mobilizing-private-capital-the-slideshow/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>still
not clear</u></a> that private sector creditors will respond
<a href="https://www.phenomenalworld.org/analysis/the-investment-climate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>with
enthusiasm</u></a>. Under these conditions, many climate-vulnerable
communities are liable to be locked out of capital markets.
</p>
<p>
Debt, after all, is not inherently bad. High debt-to-GDP ratios
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0ea2bcc4-1378-4dec-81af-0fb688edda31" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>don’t
mean anything</u></a> in and of themselves — indeed, taking on debt to
finance crucial investments can (and should!) be prosperity-enhancing
and increase a country’s future borrowing capacity.
</p>
<p>
But today’s global economic system is structured in such a way that debt
places a needlessly heavy burden on developing countries, contributing
to a “crowding out of crucial development spending,” per
<a href="https://data.undp.org/insights/debt-in-developing-economies" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>findings</u></a>
of the UN Development Programme. Almost 40% of developing countries are
setting aside over 10% of their governments’ total revenues to cover
interest payments; 62% of developing countries’ external public debt is
owed to private creditors (again, at market rates). And these figures
don’t include the debt that individual firms take on to finance, say,
energy infrastructure. Even that requires the governments of developing
countries and development banks to derisk low-return projects across
much of the Global South, a process which can plant
“<a href="https://geopolitique.eu/en/2020/12/23/planting-budgetary-time-bombs-in-africa-the-macron-doctrine-en-marche/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>budgetary
time bombs</u></a>” on those governments’ balance sheets. Where
decarbonization is concerned, private balance sheets are also public
liabilities.
</p>
<p>
Developing country governments and firms also face interest rate and
foreign exchange shocks, as higher U.S. interest rates and the
concomitant threat of currency depreciation
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ae4db21e-d2a0-458f-a096-96b5d2d19af0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>strain</u></a>
their abilities to service external debts. The perverse
<a href="https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/how-emerging-markets-hurt-poor-countries/#:~:text=But%20in%20the%20developing%20world,which%20poor%20countries%20supply%20financial" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>effect</u></a>
is to prioritize hoarding dollars earned through exports as potential
shock absorbers rather than channel them toward domestic investment
goals. Loans become a millstone around a government’s policy goals,
rather than a measurement of its ambitions.
</p>
<p>
These liquidity risks loom over climate-vulnerable countries. Take
Egypt, where this summer is expected to be
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-06-12/egypt-early-heat-wave-is-ominous-warning-for-economies-trade?utm_source=website&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=twitter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>brutally
hot enough</u></a> to force its government to import more grain and more
gas ― putting increased pressure on the
<a href="https://vlab.stern.nyu.edu/volatility/VOL.EGP%3AFOREX-R.GARCH" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>already-volatile</u></a>
Egyptian pound ― and to seriously threaten labor productivity. Egypt’s
latest Nationally Determined Contribution, its national climate plan,
states that it needs
<a href="https://x.com/danielmunevar/status/1800794501415653613" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>approximately
$35 billion per year</u></a> between now and 2030 to meet its climate
targets. Yet the International Monetary Fund expects Egypt to spend
<a href="https://x.com/danielmunevar/status/1800794501415653613" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$50
billion a year</u></a> on interest payments in that same period, all
while Egypt’s recent bailout agreement with the IMF
<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2024/03/29/pr24101-egypt-imf-executive-board-completes-first-second-reviews-eff-approves-augmentation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>commits</u></a>
to “put debt firmly on a downward path.”
</p>
<p>
This
<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/debt-crisis-climate-change-developing-countries-g20-cop27-by-maria-fernanda-espinosa-et-al-2022-12" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>debt-climate
nexus</u></a> or climate risk
<a href="https://www.phenomenalworld.org/analysis/the-doom-loop/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>doom
loop</u></a>, exemplifies why developing country negotiators and civil
society advocates have hesitated to embrace loan-based climate finance.
Debt today need not “crowd out” debt-financed climate spending tomorrow.
But that’s exactly what’s happening.
</p>
<p>
So where does that leave us? For all diplomats’ focus on the NCQG
target, how they measure it <em><em>does</em></em> matter. As it stands,
$100 million of climate finance in the form of market-rate loans to
developing countries might seriously threaten their debt sustainability.
But developed countries, the multilateral development banks, and the
International Monetary Fund can
<a href="https://www.bu.edu/gdp/2024/04/14/preventing-a-default-on-development-and-climate-how-debt-relief-can-support-development-efforts-for-over-1-billion-people/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>change</u></a>
the nature of debt finance. They can commit to making debt easier to
bear by offering lower interest rates and extending loan terms. They can
issue <em><em>more </em></em>of this concessional debt, of course,
displacing the panoply of private lenders that currently play in
sovereign bond markets. They can reform their lending standards such
that they no longer penalize borrowers for carrying high debt-to-GDP
ratios when huge debt-financed investment is precisely what staving off
climate change requires. And they can set up dollar swap lines to
provide developing countries with the resources to manage interest rate
and currency value shocks.
</p>
<p>
These strategies, if fleshed out in practical detail, can sidestep
fickle private investors, contribute to an investment-friendly reform of
the global macroeconomic architecture, and kickstart a virtuous cycle of
green development around the world. That’s the target. Can we measure up
to it?

<h2 id="heat-wave-heavy-rain-or-snow-each-threaten-parts-of-us">Heat
wave, heavy rain or snow each threaten parts of US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PHOENIX — Heat and cold extremes are expected this week in the U.S.
Officials warned Southwest residents to take precautions as a heat wave
moves east, while heavy rains and flooding could drench the Gulf states
and snow threatens parts of the Rockies and Northwest.</p>
<p>Extreme heat spread across Arizona, New Mexico and parts of Texas,
Colorado and Kansas as severe weather swept across many parts of the
U.S. on Sunday. There was unseasonable cold in the Pacific Northwest,
snow headed to the northern Rocky Mountains and heavy rainfall forecast
from the northern Plains to the Upper Midwest.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service estimated more than 63 million people
were under heat advisories on Sunday, stretching from the Southwest
northward up through Denver and into Chicago.</p>
<p>Temperatures in Phoenix, which hit 44.4 Celsius on Saturday, eased
slightly on Sunday to 43.3 Celsius. Weather service forecasters say the
first two weeks of June in Phoenix have been an average of about 3
degrees Celsius hotter than normal, making it the hottest start to June
on record.</p>
<p>“We have already seen some pretty significantly high temperatures in
our area,” said Ted Whittock, a meteorologist with the National Weather
Service in Phoenix. “We are recommending that everyone reduce their time
outdoors between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., stay hydrated and wear light,
looser fitting clothing.”</p>
<p>The heat in metro Phoenix will ease a bit Monday through Wednesday,
with the highs pushing back up as the week progresses, likely prompting
another excessive heat warning, Whittock said.</p>
<p>The heat has been especially dangerous in recent years in metro
Phoenix, where 645 people died from heat-related causes in 2023, a
record.</p>
<p>The city and Maricopa County have adopted additional measures this
year in hopes of keeping people safer, including two new overnight
cooling centers where people can rest in air conditioning after the sun
goes down. There are more than 100 other cooling centers that have been
open since May 1 where people can get cold water and sit in a cool space
during daytime hours.</p>
<p>In neighboring New Mexico, a heat advisory was in effect over the
weekend for the Chavez County plains including Roswell, where the high
was forecast to hit 41.6 degrees C on Monday. The high for Albuquerque
reached 37 C on Sunday and is forecast to cool slightly to 36 C on
Monday. The high Sunday was 40 C in El Paso, Texas, which opened five
cooling centers.</p>
<p>Temperatures in Colorado ranged from near 32.2 C in areas of
metropolitan Denver Sunday to 37.7 C in the southern city of Pueblo,
with temperatures expected to surpass 37.7 C Monday in the southern
reaches of the state.</p>
<p>The heat wave was moving eastward Sunday into the Plains and the
Great Lakes area and was expected to arrive in the Northeast by Tuesday.
The threat of thunderstorms with potential high winds and heavy rainfall
increased in the Chicago area, even as heat indices were forecast to
reach near 37.7 C through the middle of the week.</p>
<p>As the heat wave spreads eastward, temperatures in Washington and the
rest of the mid-Atlantic, as well as New England, were likely to see
highs in the mid- to upper-30s C as the week progresses, with excessive
humidity making it feel even more oppressive.</p>
<p>The U.S. last year saw the most heat waves, consisting of abnormally
hot weather lasting more than two days, since 1936.</p>
<p>While much of the country swelters, late season snow was forecast for
the northern Rockies on Monday and Tuesday. Parts of Montana and
north-central Idaho were under a winter storm warning, with as much as
15 centimeters of heavy, wet snow expected in the mountains around
Missoula, Montana. As much as 51 centimeters was predicted for higher

<p>Meanwhile, a fresh batch of tropical moisture will bring an
increasing threat of heavy rain and flash flooding to the central Gulf
Coast late Sunday into Monday. Heavy rain is expected to start Monday
morning, with the moisture shifting toward the Gulf Coast by

<p>The intense flooding from heavy rains continued to dissipate in
southern Florida, where some areas in and around Miami and Fort

centimeters.</p>

id="stereophonic-wins-tony-for-best-play-women-win-director-score-honors">‘Stereophonic’
wins Tony for best play; women win director, score honors</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — “Stereophonic,” the play about a Fleetwood Mac-like band
recording an album over a turbulent and life-changing year, got a
lighters-in-the-air cheer at the Tony Awards on Sunday, winning best new
play while theater history was made for women as Broadway directors and
score writers.</p>
<p>“Stereophonic,” the most-nominated play in Tony Awards history, is a
hyper-naturalistic meditation on the thrill and danger of collaborating
on art — the compromises, the egos and the joys. It was written by David
Adjmi with songs by former Arcade Fire member Will Butler.</p>
<p>“Oh, no. My agent gave me a beta-blocker, but it’s not working,”
Adjmi said. He added that the play took 11 years to manifest.</p>
<p>“This was a very hard journey to get up here,” he said. “We need to
fund the arts in America.” He dedicated it to all the artists out
there.</p>
<p>Danya Taymor — whose aunt is Julie Taymor, the first woman to win a
Tony Award for directing a musical — became the 11th woman to win the
award. She helmed “The Outsiders,” a gritty musical adaptation of the
classic American young adult novel.</p>
<p>“Thank you to the great women who have lifted me up,” she said,
naming producer Angelina Jolie among those on her list.</p>
<p>Then Shaina Taub, only the second woman in Broadway history to write,
compose and star in a Broadway musical, won for best score, following
such writers as Cyndi Lauper, Lisa Kron and Jeanine Tesori. Taub, the
force behind “Suffs,” won for best book earlier in the night.</p>
<p>Her musical is about the heroic final years of the fight to allow
women to vote, leading to the passage of the 19th Amendment.</p>
<p>“If you are inspired by the story of Suffs, please make sure you and
everyone you know have registered to vote and vote, vote, vote!” she
said. Taub also said the win was for all the loud girls out there: “Go
for it,” she urged.</p>
<p>Earlier, Alicia Keys electrified the show when she teamed up with
superstar Jay-Z on their hit “Empire State of Mind.” Keys appeared at
the piano on the stage of the David H. Koch Theater in Lincoln Center as
the cast of her semi-autobiographical musical, “Hell’s Kitchen,” was
presenting a medley of songs. She began singing her and Jay-Z’s 2009
smash before leaving the stage to join the rapper on some interior steps
to wild applause.</p>
<p>Host Ariana DeBose kicked off the telecast with an original,
acrobatic number, and Jeremy Strong took home the first big award of the
night as Broadway’s biggest party opened its arms to hip-hop and rock
fans.</p>
<p>Strong, the “Succession” star, landed his first Tony for his work in
the revival of Henrik Ibsen’s 1882 political play “An Enemy of the
People.” The theater award for best lead actor in a play will sit next
to his Emmy, Screen Actors Guild Award and Golden Globe.</p>
<p>The play is about a public-minded doctor in a small town who
discovers the water supply for the public spa is contaminated, but his
efforts to clean up the mess pit his ethics against political
cowards.</p>
<p>“This play is a cry from the heart,” he said.</p>
<p>Kara Young, the first Black performer to be nominated for a Tony
three consecutive years in a row, won this time as best featured actress
in a play for “Purlie Victorious,” the story of a Black preacher’s
scheme to reclaim his inheritance and win back his church from a
plantation owner.</p>
<p>“Thank you to my ancestors,” she said, adding thanks to her mom and
dad, brother, partner, cast, her co-star Leslie Odom Jr. and her
director, Kenny Leon. She saved her last thanks to playwright Ossie
Davis and his star Ruby Dee, who originated the role.</p>
<p>“Harry Potter” star Daniel Radcliffe cemented his stage career pivot
by winning a featured actor in a musical Tony, his first trophy in five
Broadway shows. He won for the revival of “Merrily We Roll Along,” the
Stephen Sondheim-George Furth musical that goes backward in time.</p>
<p>“This is one of the best experiences of my life,” Radcliffe said,
thanking his cast and director. “I will never have it as good again.” He
also thanked his parents for playing Sondheim in the car growing up.</p>
<p>Kecia Lewis, who plays a formidable piano teacher in “Hell’s
Kitchen,” took home her first Tony. The 40-year veteran made her
Broadway debut at 18 in the original company of “Dreamgirls” and endured
amazing moments and heartbreak.</p>
<p>“This moment is the one I dreamed of for those 40 years,” she told
the crowd. “Don’t give up!”</p>
<p>“Appropriate,” Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’ play — centered on a family
reunion in Arkansas where everyone has competing motivations and
grievances — was named best play revival. Jacobs-Jenkins in his remarks
thanked Davis, saying there would be no “Appropriate” without “Purlie
Victorious.”</p>
<p>Three-time Tony-honored Chita Rivera got a tribute by Tony winners
Audra McDonald, Brian Stokes Mitchell and Bebe Neuwirth. Images of her
work in “Chicago,” “Kiss of the Spider Woman” and “West Side Story” were
projected while dancers mimicked her hit numbers. DeBose, who won an
Oscar in Rivera’s old “West Side Story” role of Anita, also joined
in.</p>

Travelers from 177 nations crossed country toward US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MEXICO CITY — Around 1.39 million people from 177 countries traveled
through Mexico so far this year trying to reach the United States
without entry papers, the Mexican government said Sunday.</p>
<p>The vast majority were men or women traveling alone, while almost
3,000 were unaccompanied minors, the National Migration Institute said,
providing figures for January through the end of May.</p>
<p>The figure of 177 countries of origin represents almost the whole
world – the United Nations has 193 member states.</p>
<p>By country, the largest number of would-be migrants at nearly 380,000
came from Venezuela, which has endured severe economic hardship for
years, followed by Guatemala, Honduras, Ecuador and Haiti, all of which
are hard hit by gang and drug-trafficking violence.</p>
<p>Others attempting the dangerous trek through Mexico in search of a
better life in the United States came from as far afield as China,
India, Mauritania and Angola, the institute said.</p>
<p>In 2023 alone more than 2.4 million people crossed the U.S.-Mexico
border without the required documentation, according to U.S.
figures.</p>
<p>The flow hit a record of 10,000 people per day in December although
it has fallen as both countries cracked down on such crossings.</p>

tourist dies on Greek island near Corfu, 3 others missing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Athens, Greece — A missing American tourist has been found dead on a
beach on a small Greek island west of Corfu, local media reported.</p>
<p>The body of the man was found Sunday on a rocky, fairly remote beach
on the island of Mathraki by another tourist. He had been reported
missing Thursday by his host, a Greek-American friend. The tourist had
last been seen Tuesday at a cafe in the company of two female tourists
who have since left the island.</p>
<p>No further details about the victim, including a name or hometown,
were immediately available.</p>
<p>Mathraki, which has a population of 100, is a 3.9-square-kilometer
(1.2-square-mile) heavily wooded island, west of the better-known island
of Corfu.</p>
<p>This was the latest in a string of recent cases in which tourists on
the Greek islands have died or gone missing. Some, if not all, had set
out on hikes in very hot temperatures.</p>
<p>A 74-year-old Dutch tourist was found by a fire department drone
Saturday lying face down in a ravine about 300 meters (330 yards) from
the spot where he was last observed last Sunday, walking with some
difficulty in the blistering heat.</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Mosley, a noted British television presenter and author,
was found dead last Sunday on the island of Symi. A coroner concluded
that he had died the previous Wednesday, shortly after going for a hike
over difficult, rocky terrain.</p>
<p>On Friday, two French tourists were reported missing on Sikinos, a
relatively secluded Cyclades island in the Aegean Sea, with less than
400 permanent residents.</p>
<p>The two women, ages 64 and 73, had left their respective hotels to
meet.</p>
<p>On the island of Amorgos, also in the Cyclades, authorities are still
searching for a 59-year-old tourist reported missing since Tuesday,
after he went on a solo hike in very hot conditions. U.S. media
identified the missing tourist as retired Los Angeles County Deputy
Sheriff Albert Calibet of Hermosa Beach, California.</p>

celebrates packed and varied theater season with 2024 Tony Awards</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — The 28 Broadway shows that earned at least one Tony Award
nomination are hoping Sunday is the day the sealed envelopes break in
their favor.</p>
<p>The three-hour main telecast from New York City’s Lincoln Center will
air on CBS and stream on Paramount+ starting at 8 p.m. Eastern, with a
free pre-show on Pluto TV at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<p>‘A time of transformation’  </p>
<p>The awards cap a Broadway theater season that had something for
everyone — fun musicals like “Back to the Future,” sweeping romance in
“The Notebook,” political rallying cries like “Suffs” and intimate
ensembles like “Mother Play” and “Appropriate.” Filipinos took center
stage in “Here Lies Love” and autism was explored in “How to Dance in
Ohio.”</p>
<p>“I think it has been a year of real flexibility. I also think
Broadway is in a time of transformation,” said Tonys host Ariana DeBose.
“A total of 36 productions opened on Broadway this season alone and each
one spoke to a very different audience. I do believe that we are
learning, ‘If you build it, they will come.’ So we are continuing to
find our voice and who Broadway wants to be.”</p>
<p>DeBose has said she expects the show to move “like a Broadway show” —
in other words, briskly and with scene changes in front the audience.
“We want to give you a full Broadway experience,” she said.</p>
<p>Nicole Scherzinger will anchor the “In Memoriam” section and the late
Chita Rivera will get a separate tribute from Audra McDonald, Brian
Stokes Mitchell and Bebe Neuwirth.</p>
<p>Some key awards to watch</p>
<p>Two shows share the most nominations with 13: a piano prodigy’s
coming-of-age in “Hell’s Kitchen” and the back-and-forth struggles to
create a rock album in the play “Stereophonic.” They are competing in
different categories, best new musical and best new play.</p>
<p>Of the 26 competitive categories, two are virtual locks:
“Stereophonic,” a critical and box office triumph, and “Merrily We Roll
Along,” the Stephen Sondheim- George Furth musical that flopped when it
premiered on Broadway in 1981 but is the strong favorite for best
musical revival.</p>
<p>A case could also be made that “Appropriate,” Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’
play about a family reunion in Arkansas where everyone has competing
motivations and grievances, will comfortably earn the best play revival
award.</p>
<p>Looking to beat “Hell’s Kitchen” for the top new musical crown are
“The Outsiders,” an adaptation of the beloved S. E. Hinton novel and
Francis Ford Coppola film; “Illinoise,” the dance-heavy, dialogue-less
stage adaptation of Sufjan Stevens’ 2005 album “Illinois”; “Suffs,”
based on the American suffragists of the early 20th century; and “Water
for Elephants,” which combines Sara Gruen’s 2006 bestseller with circus
elements.</p>
<p>Hoping to knock down “Stereophonic” are “Mother Play,” Paula Vogel’s
look at a mother and her kids spanning 1964 to the 21st century; “Mary
Jane,” Amy Herzog’s humanistic portrait of a divorced mother of a young
boy with severe health issues; “Prayer for the French Republic,” Joshua
Harmon’s sprawling family comedy-drama that deals with Zionism,
religious fervency and antisemitism; and “Jaja’s African Hair Braiding,”
Jocelyn Bioh’s comedy about the lives of West African women working at a
salon.</p>
<p>The leading actress in a musical race is between veteran Kelli O’Hara
in “Days of Wine and Roses” and “Hell’s Kitchen” newcomer Maleah Joi
Moon. On the play side, Sarah Paulson from “Appropriate” is expected to
win the best lead actress trophy over a challenge by Jessica Lange in
“Mother Play.”</p>
<p>On the men’s side, former “Hamilton” standout Leslie Odom Jr. from
“Purlie Victorious” is up against “Succession” star Jeremy Strong in the
revival of “An Enemy of the People,” while Jonathan Groff is the
favorite to win on the musical side for “Merrily We Roll Along,”
competing against Eddie Redmayne in “Cabaret at the Kit Kat Club” and
Brian d’Arcy James from “Days of Wine and Roses.”</p>

id="strong-winds-steep-terrain-hamper-crews-battling-los-angeles-areas-first-major-fire-of-the-year">Strong
winds, steep terrain hamper crews battling Los Angeles area’s first
major fire of the year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Gorman, California — Strong winds pushed flames through dry brush in
mountains along Interstate 5 north of Los Angeles on Sunday, and
officials warned residents in the wildfire’s path to be prepared to
leave if it explodes in size again.</p>
<p>Los Angeles County’s first major wildfire of the year swiftly grew to
more than 40 square kilometers, one day after it forced the evacuation
of at least 1,200 campers, off-roaders and hikers from the Hungry Valley
recreation area.</p>
<p>The blaze, dubbed the Post Fire, was just 2% contained. No injuries
were reported. The cause was under investigation.</p>
<p>Firefighters working in sweltering conditions and steep terrain raced
to douse spot fires that erupted as unpredictable winds blew embers
ahead of the flames, said Kenichi Haskett, a section chief for the LA
County Fire Department. The gusts also hampered efforts by aircraft
crews to drop water and fire retardant, he said.</p>
<p>“When it’s windy, it just sprays the water everywhere we don’t need
it. So that’s a challenge,” Haskett said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Northern California, a small wildfire sparked Sunday
prompted evacuation orders and warnings for a sparsely populated area
near Lake Sonoma. The so-called Point Fire sent up a huge plume of dark
smoke as it churned through brush and timber about 130 kilometers north
of San Francisco. It was 15% contained.</p>
<p>The Southern California fire erupted Saturday afternoon near I-5 in
Gorman, about 100 kilometers northwest of Los Angeles. Two structures
burned within the evacuated recreation area.</p>
<p>Flames were moving toward Pyramid Lake, a popular destination for
boaters that was closed as a precaution on Father’s Day. No houses were
threatened Sunday, but officials warned residents of Castaic, home to
about 19,000 people, that they should prepare to leave if the fire
pushes further south.</p>
<p>“If you’re in a warning area, be prepared with a ‘go bag,’ with
overnight clothes and your cellphone, your medicines, your glasses. Have
your car fueled up,” said Haskett. “Be ready to evacuate.”</p>
<p>Low humidity and gusts around 80 kph were expected throughout the
day, and winds could pick up speed after sundown, warned the National
Weather Service office for Los Angeles.</p>
<p>About 120 kilometers to the east, the 5-square-kilometer Hesperia
Fire forced road closures and prompted evacuation warnings after it
broke out Saturday near mountain communities in San Bernardino County.
The blaze was 7% contained Sunday.</p>

Hi,<br/> The Oberon subsystem opens in revision.10272 but the
&lt;delete&gt; key doesn't delete, &lt;F1&gt; doesn't set the star and
&lt;F2&gt; doesn't clear marks. HotKeys has preempted the familiar
Oberon key functionalities?
</p>
<p dir="auto">
I found a note that &lt;F12&gt; should disable or toggle HotKeys. In
10272 &lt;F12&gt; gives a report in the log that a SystemTools command
doesn't exist.
</p>
<p dir="auto">
SystemTools was omitted inadvertently?

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;The other day I was emailing with &lt;a href=&quot;https://starbreaker.org/&quot;&gt;Matthew “Starbreaker” Graybosch&lt;/a&gt; about his recent post titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://starbreaker.org/blog/tech/robots-txt-nuclear-option/index.html&quot;&gt;“robots.txt: the Nuclear Option”&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a regular reader of this site you know I love this kind of stuff and I especially love nuclear options when it comes to fighting silly tech.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I experimented with blocking everything in the past but this recent
exchange made me want to revisit this idea. With perfect timing, Robb
Knight posted

<p>
I already had a 403 in place for Mastodon because I don’t want to get a
shit ton of traffic coming my way every time someone posts a link of
mine but I loved Matthew’s idea of returning a

</p>
<p>
So I grabbed 180 or so entries from the
<a href="https://darkvisitors.com/agents">Dark Visitors’s agents
list</a> and set up an NGINX redirect based on those UA. Gonna be
interesting to see if this has any effect on the server so I’ll write a
follow-up.

I tried to leave out all the RSS fetchers because I love RSS, RSS is

it.

<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Way, way, way back in 2009, we reported on a small hobby operating
system called StreamOS – version 0.21-RC1 had just been released that
day. StreamOS was a 32-bit operating system written in Object Pascal
using the Free Pascal Compiler, running on top of FreeDOS. It turns out
that its creator, Oleksandr Natalenko (yes, the same person), recovered
the old code, and republished it on Codeberg for posterity. It’s not a
complete history, rather a couple of larger breadcrumbs stuck together
with git. I didn’t do source code management much back in the days, and
there are still some intermediate dev bits scattered across my backup
drive that I cannot even date properly, but three branches I pushed
(along with binaries, btw; feel free to fire up that qemu of yours and
see how it crashes!) should contain major parts of what was done. ↫
Oleksandr Natalenko It may not carry the same import as Doom for the
SNES, but it’s still great to see such continuity 15 years apart. I hope
Natalenko manages to recover the remaining bits and bobs too, because
you may never know – someone might be interested in picking up this 15
year old baton.</p>

<p>
The FTC gets involved in the obviously rife practice of overselling the
capabilities of AI services. These are solid guidelines, and hopefully
the precursor to more meaningful action when vendors inevitably cross
the line.
</p>
<p>
While these points are all important, for me the most pertinent is the
last:

<blockquote>
<p>
“Don’t violate consumer privacy rights. These avatars and bots can
collect or infer a lot of intensely personal information. Indeed, some
companies are marketing as a feature the ability of such AI services to
know everything about us. It’s imperative that companies are honest and
transparent about the collection and use of this information and that
they don’t surreptitiously change privacy policies or relevant terms of
service.”

It’s often unclear how much extra data is being gathered behind the
scenes when AI features are added. This is where battles will be fought
and lines will be drawn, particularly in enterprises and well-regulated
industries.

<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-mac-enclaves-and-exclaves">A brief history of
Mac enclaves and exclaves</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Howard Oakley has written an interesting history of secure enclaves
on the Mac, and when he touches upon “exclaves”, a new concept that
doesn’t have a proper term yet, he mentions something interesting. While
an enclave is a territory entirely surrounded by the territory of
another state, an exclave is an isolated fragment of a state that exists
separately from the main part of that state. Although exclave isn’t a
term normally used in computing, macOS 14.4 introduced three kernel
extensions concerned with exclaves. They seem to have appeared first in
iOS 17, where they’re thought to code domains isolated from the kernel
that protect key functions in macOS even when the kernel becomes
compromised. This in turn suggests that Apple is in the process of
refactoring the kernel into a central micro-kernel with protected
exclaves. This has yet to be examined in Sequoia. ↫ Howard Oakley I’m
not going to add too much here since I’m not well-versed enough in the
world of macOS to add anything meaningful, but I do think it’s an
interesting theory worth looking into by people who posses far more
knowledge about this topic than I do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“United Airlines announced that it is bringing personalized advertising
to the seatback entertainment screens on its flights. The move is aimed
at increasing the airline’s revenue by leveraging the data that it has
on its passengers.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Just another reason why friends don’t let friends fly United. We should
all be reducing our air travel overall anyway, given the climate crisis,
and in a world where we all fly less, shouldn’t we choose a better
experience?
</p>
<p>
This sounds like the absolute worst:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“United believes its advertising network will be appealing to brands
because “there is the potential for 3.5 hours of attention per traveler,
based on average flight time.”“
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Passengers from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Virginia, and Utah
can opt out of having their private information used to show targeted
ads to them for the duration of what sounds like an agonizing flight.
Passengers from other US States are out of luck - at least until their
legislatures <em>also</em> pass reasonable privacy legislation.
</p>
<p>
Other airlines are removing seat-back entertainment to reduce fuel, so
on top of the baseline climate impact of the air travel industry,
there’s a real additional climate implication here. Planes with
seat-back entertainment, in general, use more fuel; United is making a
revenue decision with all kinds of negative impacts that they should not
be rewarded for.

Perplexity AI doesn’t use its advertised browser string or IP range to
load content from third-party websites:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“So they’re using headless browsers to scrape content, ignoring
robots.txt, and not sending their user agent string. I can’t even block
their IP ranges because it appears these headless browsers are not on
their IP ranges.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On one level, I understand why this is happening, as everyone who’s ever
written a scraper (or scraper mitigations) might: the crawler for
training the model likely <em>does</em> use the correct browser string,
but on-demand calls likely don’t to prevent them from being blocked.
That’s not a good excuse at all, but I bet that’s what’s going on.
</p>
<p>
This is another example of the core issue with robots.txt: it’s a
handshake agreement at best. There are no legal or technical
restrictions imposed by it; we all just hope that bots do the right
thing. Some of them do, but a lot of them don’t.
</p>
<p>
The only real way to restrict these services is through legal rules that
create meaningful consequences for these companies. Until then, there
will be no sure-fire way to prevent your content from being accessed by
an AI agent.

Roberts help Biden raise $28 million at fundraiser featuring dire
warnings about Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Some of Hollywood’s brightest stars headlined a glitzy
fundraiser for President Joe Biden on Saturday night, helping raise what
his reelection campaign said was $28 million and hoping to energize
would-be supporters for a November election that they argued was among
the most important in the nation’s history.</p>
<p>George Clooney, Julia Roberts and Barbra Streisand were among those
who took the stage at the 7,100-seat Peacock Theater in Los Angeles.
Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel interviewed Biden and former President
Barack Obama, who both stressed the need to defeat former President
Donald Trump in a race that’s expected to be exceedingly close.</p>
<p>During more than half an hour of discussion, Kimmel asked if the
country was suffering from amnesia about the presumptive Republican
nominee, to which Biden responded, “all we gotta do is remember what it
was like” when Trump was in the White House.</p>
<p>Luminaries from the entertainment world have increasingly lined up to
help Biden’s campaign, and just how important the event was to his
reelection bid could be seen in the Democratic president’s decision to
fly through the night across nine time zones, from the G7 summit in
southern Italy to Southern California, to attend.</p>
<p>He also missed a summit in Switzerland about ways to end Russia’s war
in Ukraine, instead dispatching Vice President Kamala Harris who made a
whirlwind trip of her own to represent the United States there, a stark
reminder of the delicate balance between geopolitics and Biden’s bid to
win a second term.</p>
<p>Further laying bare the political implications were police in riot
gear outside the theater, ready for protests from pro-Palestinian
activists angry about his administration’s handling of Israel’s war
against Hamas in Gaza.</p>
<p>The event featured singing by Jack Black and Sheryl Lee Ralph, and
actors Kathryn Hahn and Jason Bateman introduced Kimmel, who introduced
Biden and Obama. The comedian deadpanned, “I was told I was getting
introduced by Batman, not Bateman.”</p>
<p>But he quickly pivoted to far more serious topics, saying that “so
much is at stake in this election” and listing women’s rights, health
care and noting that “even the ballot is on the ballot” in a reference
to the Biden administration’s calls to expand voting rights.</p>
<p>Kimmel asked the president what he was most proud of accomplishing,
and Biden said he thought the administration’s approach to the economy
“is working.”</p>
<p>“We have the strongest economy in the world today,” Biden said,
adding “we try to give ordinary people an even chance.”</p>
<p>Trump spent Saturday campaigning in Detroit and criticized Biden’s
handling of the economy and inflation. The president was fundraising
“with out-of-touch elitist Hollywood celebrities,” Trump campaign
spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said.</p>
<p>But Biden told the crowd in California that “we passed every major
piece of legislation we attempted to get done.” And Obama expressed
admiration for sweeping legislation on health care, public works, the
environment, technology manufacturing, gun safety and other major
initiatives that the administration of his former vice president has
overseen.</p>
<p>“What we’re seeing now is a byproduct of in 2016. There were a whole
bunch of folks who, for whatever reason, sat out,” said Obama, who, like
Biden wore a dark suit and a white shirt open at the collar. </p>
<p>Obama, speaking about the Supreme Court, added that “hopefully we
have learned our lesson, because these elections matter in very concrete
ways.”</p>
<p>Trump nominated three justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade, the
landmark decision guaranteeing a constitutional right to an abortion.
The audience expressed its displeasure at the mention of Roe, to which
Obama responded, “don’t hiss, vote.” That was a play on his common
refrain prioritizing voting over booing.</p>
<p>Biden said the person elected president in November could get the
chance to nominate two new justices, though a second Biden term probably
wouldn’t drastically overhaul a court that currently features a 6-3
conservative majority.</p>
<p>He also suggested if Trump wins back the White House, “one of the
scariest parts” was the Supreme Court and how the high court has “never
been this far out of step.”</p>
<p>Biden also referenced reports that an upside-down flag, a symbol
associated with Trump’s false claims of election fraud, was flown
outside the home of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito in January 2021.
He worried Saturday that, if Trump is reelected, “He’s going to appoint
two more who fly their flags upside down.”</p>
<p>Kimmel brought his special brand of humor to the event. At one point
he asked how can a president get back at a talk-show host who makes fun
of him on TV every night.</p>
<p>“Ever hear of Delta Force?” Biden responded, referring to the Army
special operations unit.</p>
<p>Earlier in the program, Kimmel noted Biden’s campaign promise to
restore the soul of America and said “lately it seems we might need an
exorcism.” Then he asked Biden, “Is that why you visited the pope?”
Biden and Pope Francis met in Italy on Friday.</p>
<p>Biden’s campaign said it was still counting, but Saturday night’s
gathering had taken in at least $28 million, more money than any event
for a Democratic candidate in history.</p>
<p>That meant outpacing the president’s fundraiser in March at Radio
City Music Hall in New York, which raised $26 million and featured
late-night host Stephen Colbert interviewing Biden, Obama and former
President Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Biden held an early lead in the campaign money race against Trump,
but the former president has gained ground since he formally locked up
the Republican nomination.</p>
<p>Trump outpaced Biden’s New York event by raking in $50.5 million at
an April gathering of major donors at the Florida home of billionaire
investor John Paulson. The former president’s campaign and the
Republican National Committee announced they raised a whopping $141
million in May, padded by tens of millions of dollars in contributions
that flowed in after Trump’s guilty verdict in his criminal hush money
trial.</p>
<p>That post-conviction bump came after Trump and the Republican Party
announced collecting $76 million in April, far exceeding Biden and the
Democrats’ $51 million for the month.</p>

id="poultry-industry-could-serve-as-example-as-dairy-farmers-confront-bird-flu">Poultry
industry could serve as example as dairy farmers confront bird flu</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>des moines, iowa — As the U.S. dairy industry confronts a bird flu
outbreak, with cases reported at dozens of farms and the disease
spreading to people, the egg industry could serve as an example of how
to slow the disease but also shows how difficult it can be to eradicate
the virus.</p>
<p>There have been earlier bird flu outbreaks in the U.S., but the
current one started in February 2022 and has forced the slaughter of
nearly 100 million chickens and turkeys. Hot spots still occur, but
their frequency has dropped in part because of biosecurity efforts at
farms and a coordinated approach between companies and agricultural
officials, experts say.</p>
<p>Dairy farmers could try to implement similar safeguards, but the vast
differences between the animals and the industries limit what lessons
can be learned and applied.</p>
<p>How can a 1,500-pound cow and a 5-pound chicken have the same
illness?It’s commonly called bird flu because the disease is largely
spread by wild birds that can survive infections. Many mammals have
caught the illness, too, including sea lions and skunks.</p>
<p>Effects differ greatly</p>
<p>Animals can be infected by eating an infected bird or by being
exposed to environments where the virus is present. That said, there are
big differences in how cows and chickens have fared after getting
infected.</p>
<p>Bird flu is typically fatal to chickens and turkeys within days of an
infection, leading to immediate mass killings of birds. That’s not true
for cows.</p>
<p>Dairies in several states have reported having to kill infected
animals because symptoms continued to linger and their milk production
didn’t recover, but that’s not the norm, said Russ Daly, an extension
veterinarian at South Dakota State University.</p>
<p>He said it appears that bird flu isn’t usually fatal to cows but that
an infected animal can be more vulnerable to other ailments typically
founds in dairies, such as bacterial pneumonia and udder infections.</p>
<p>What has the egg industry done to protect chickens? Egg operators
have become clean freaks.</p>
<p>To prevent disease from spreading, egg producers require workers to
shower and change into clean clothes before they enter a barn and shower
again when they leave. They also frequently wash trucks and spray tires
with solutions to kill off virus remnants.</p>
<p>Many egg operations even use lasers and install special fencing to
discourage wild birds from stopping by for a visit.</p>
<p>“Gone is the day of the scarecrow,” said Emily Metz, president of the
American Egg Board.</p>
<p>Without these efforts, the current outbreak would be much worse, said
Jada Thompson, a University of Arkansas agriculture business professor.
Still, maintaining such vigilance is difficult, even if the cost of
allowing disease into an operation is so high, she said.</p>
<p>Chickens raised for meat, known as broilers, also have been infected
with bird flu but such cases are less common. In part, that’s because
broiler chickens are killed when they’re only 6 to 8 weeks old, so they
have less time to get infected.</p>
<p>Some safeguards apply</p>
<p>Can the same be done to protect cows and dairy workers? Yes and
no.</p>
<p>Dairies can certainly reduce the spread of disease by limiting access
to barns, so people and equipment don’t bring in the virus from
elsewhere. Workers could also wear eye protection, aprons and gloves to
try to protect themselves, but there’s no way around it: Big animals are
messy.</p>
<p>“The parlor is a warm, humid place with lots of liquid flying around,
whether it’s urine, feces, water, because they’re spraying off areas.
Cows might kick off a milk machine, so you get milk splatter,” said
Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Laboratory.</p>
<p>Dairies also don’t have time or staff to disinfect milking equipment
between animals, so equipment could become contaminated. Pasteurization
kills bacteria and viruses in milk, making it safe for people to
drink.</p>
<p>Poulsen said the dairy industry could follow a path laid by the
poultry and pork industries and establish more formal, better funded
research organizations so it could respond more quickly to problems like
bird flu — or avoid them altogether.</p>
<p>The dairy industry also could tamp down disease spread by limiting
the movement of lactating cows between states, Poulsen said.</p>
<p>Are there new efforts to fight the virus? The U.S. Department of
Agriculture will soon begin testing a vaccine that could be given to
calves, offering the animals protection and also reducing the chance of
worker illnesses.</p>
<p>The egg industry also is hopeful researchers can develop vaccines for
poultry that could be quick, inexpensive and effective. Workers can’t
give shots to the millions of hens that might need a vaccine, but
industry officials hope a vaccine could be distributed in the water the
birds drink, in the pellets they eat or even before birds hatch from
their eggs.</p>
<p>Efforts to develop vaccines have become even more important now that
the disease has spread to dairy cows and even a few people, Thompson
said.</p>
<p>“Part of what is being developed right now is: What way can we
vaccinate them that is cost-effective and disease-resistant?” Thompson
said.</p>

<h2 id="on-fathers-day-lgbtq-couple-celebrates-their-sperm-donor">On
Father’s Day, LGBTQ+ couple celebrates their sperm donor</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PRAIRIE VILLAGE, Kansas — David Titterington had a sense of what his
childhood friend would ask him when she led him into a photo booth at a
mutual friend’s wedding roughly a decade ago. As the countdown for the
second photo ticked, Jen Wilson popped the question: Will you be my
sperm donor?</p>
<p>“Of course I said yes,” Titterington said. “I mean, who would have
guessed that, being a gay man, I would have this opportunity to have
biological children and also be part of their lives?”</p>
<p>On Father’s Day, which is Sunday, Kansas residents Jen and Whitney
Wilson will pack up their three children — ages 9, 7 and 3 — and head to
picnic at Titterington’s Missouri house to celebrate the man who helped
make their family possible. Like other LGBTQ+ couples, they and their
sperm donor have created their own traditions around Father’s Day.</p>
<p>“We just have decided to celebrate him,” said Jen Wilson, who works
as the executive director of the LGBTQ+ advocacy group Modern Family
Alliance.</p>
<p>For LGBTQ+ people, single-parent households, other nontraditional
families or those with strained family relationships, Father’s Day and
Mother’s Day can be painful and confusing. Events featuring those
holidays at school can make some children feel isolated. Jen Wilson said
many schools are working toward being more inclusive, such as turning
events like “Donuts with Dads” to “Donuts with Grown-Ups.”</p>
<p>“There are families who don’t have a David, who can’t really point
to, like, this is what it means to be a dad or have a father figure. So
I consider us really lucky,” Whitney Wilson said. She later added: “I
think we’re really lucky in that we have lots of people in our life to
point to. Not just David … grandpas and uncles and all kinds of people
who are also fathers.”</p>
<p>Between 2 million and 3.3 million children under age 18 have an
LGBTQ+ parent, according to the group Family Equality.</p>
<p>Such families are growing more visible in recent years, said Cathy
Renna, the communications director of the National LGBTQ Task Force.
Most Pride events now include family-friendly activities, like climbing
walls, she said.</p>
<p>“Now we see families of all kinds and shapes and sizes, and that’s
really important. It’s important not just for us,” Renna said. “It’s
also important for kids to understand, you know, that families do come
in many different, configurations and that families are about love.”</p>
<p>When it comes to Father’s Day, Jen Wilson said: “People focus so much
on just their own father instead of highlighting the fact that there are
a lot of really great fathers in the world in lots of different
communities and just celebrating them for stepping up and … being the
great dads that they are.”</p>
<p>Jen Wilson and Titterington have been friends since childhood. When
Jen Wilson and her wife began planning for a family, Titterington tossed
out the idea of being a sperm donor, and he was overjoyed when the
couple later made the ask official.</p>
<p>Titterington sees his role in the kids’ lives as more akin to a
godfather than a father. He and his husband go to school events and
birthday parties, and Titterington said they see themselves as “coaching
them from the sidelines.” He said he is partial to the title “blood
father,” but the Wilsons said the children more often refer to him as
their “bio dad” or “donor dad.”</p>
<p>“I am their father, but I’m not really their parent,” Titterington
said. “Because Jennifer and Whitney are the two parents, and they’re
doing an amazing job.”</p>
<p>Even with David, the idea that the children don’t have a dad can be
hard for them, Whitney Wilson said, but it isn’t “something that keeps
anybody in our house up at night.”</p>
<p>“There are a lot of people that would love the opportunity to tell
our children how terrible it is that they don’t have a father figure in
their life,” Jen Wilson said. “We know that’s not true.”</p>
<p>For Titterington, fatherhood is the weight of the Wilsons’ firstborn
falling asleep on his chest, gifts of scribbled artwork that can never
be thrown away, and cleaning up after a toddler in potty training. But
after a tiring weekend slumber party, he can send the children home to
their mothers.</p>
<p>“There’s so many ways to be a father,” Titterington said. “We get to
celebrate all kinds of fathers on Father’s Day.”</p>

id="midwives-state-law-could-jeopardize-native-hawaiian-birth-traditions">Midwives:
State law could jeopardize Native Hawaiian birth traditions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HONOLULU — Ki’inaniokalani Kahoʻohanohano longed for a deeper
connection to her Native Hawaiian ancestors and culture as she prepared
to give birth to her first child at home on the north shore of Maui in
2003.</p>
<p>But generations of colonialist suppression had eroded many Hawaiian
traditions, and it was hard to find information on how the islands’
Indigenous people honored pregnancy or childbirth. Nor could she find a
Native Hawaiian midwife.</p>
<p>That experience led Kahoʻohanohano — now a mother of five — to become
a Native Hawaiian midwife herself, a role in which she spent years
helping to deliver as many as three babies a month, receiving them in a
traditional cloth made of woven bark and uttering sacred, tremorous
chants as she welcomed them into the world.</p>
<p>Her quest to preserve tradition also led her into a downtown Honolulu
courtroom this week, where she and others are seeking to block a state
law that they say endangers their ability to continue serving pregnant
women who hope for such customary Native Hawaiian births.</p>
<p>“To be able to have our babies in the places and in the ways of our
kupuna, our ancestors, is very vital,” she testified. “To me, the point
of what we do is to be able to return birth home to these places.”</p>
<p>Lawmakers enacted a midwife licensure law in 2019, finding that the
“improper practice of midwifery poses a significant risk of harm to the
mother or newborn, and may result in death.” Violations are punishable
by up to a year in jail, plus thousands of dollars in criminal and civil
fines.</p>
<p>The measure requires anyone who provides “assessment, monitoring, and
care” during pregnancy, labor, childbirth and during the postpartum
period to be licensed. The women’s lawsuit says that would include a
wide range of people, including midwives, doulas, lactation consultants,
and even family and friends of the new mother.</p>
<p>Until last summer, the law provided an exception for “birth
attendants,” which allowed Kahoʻohanohano to continue practicing Native
Hawaiian birth customs. With that exception now expired, however, she
and others face the licensing requirements — which, they say, include
costly programs only available out of state or online that don’t align
with Hawaiian culture and beliefs.</p>
<p>In 2022, the average cost of an accredited midwifery program was
$6,200 to $6,900 a year, according to court documents filed by the
state.</p>
<p>Attorneys for the state argued in a court filing that the law
“undoubtedly serves a compelling interest in protecting pregnant persons
from receiving ill-advice from untrained individuals.”</p>
<p>State Deputy Attorney General Isaac Ickes told Judge Shirley Kawamura
that the law doesn’t outlaw Native Hawaiian midwifery or homebirths, but
that requiring a license reduces the risks of harm or death.</p>
<p>The dispute is the latest in a long history of debate about how and
whether Hawaii should regulate the practice of traditional healing arts
that dates to well before the islands became the 50th state in 1959.
Those arts were banished or severely restricted for much of the 20th
century, but the Hawaiian Indigenous rights movement of the 1970s
renewed interest in the customary ways.</p>
<p>Hawaii eventually adopted a system where councils versed in Native
Hawaiian healing certify traditional practitioners, though those suing
say their efforts to form such a council for midwifery have failed.</p>
<p>Practicing midwifery without a license, meanwhile, was banned until
1998 — when, lawmakers say, they inadvertently decriminalized it when
they altered the regulation of nurse-midwives, something the 2019 law
sought to remedy.</p>
<p>Among the nine plaintiffs are women who seek traditional births and
argue that the new licensing requirement violates their right of privacy
and reproductive autonomy under Hawaii’s Constitution. They are
represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights and the Native
Hawaiian Legal Corporation.</p>
<p>“For pregnant people whose own family may no longer hold the
knowledge of the ceremonial and sacred aspects of birth, a midwife
trained in Native Hawaiian traditional and customary birthing practices
can be an invaluable, culturally informed health care provider,” the
lawsuit states.</p>
<p>When Kahoʻohanohano was unable to find a Native Hawaiian midwife to
attend the birth of her first child, she turned instead to a Native
American one, who was open to incorporating traditional Hawaiian aspects
that Kahoʻohanohano gleaned from her elders.</p>
<p>She surrounded herself with Hawaiian cultural practitioners focusing
on pule, or prayer, and lomilomi, a traditional massage with physical
and spiritual elements. It all helped ease her three days of labor, she
said. And then, “two pushes and pau” — done — the boy was born.</p>
<p>The births of her five children in various Maui communities,
Kahoʻohanohano said, were her “greatest teachers” in herself becoming
one of the very few midwives who know about Native Hawaiian birthing
practices.</p>
<p>She is believed to be the first person in a century to give birth on
her husband’s ancestral lands in Kahakuloa, a remote west Maui valley of
mostly Native Hawaiians, where her daughter was born in 2015. The
community is at least 40 minutes along winding roads to the island’s
only hospital.</p>
<p>Kahoʻohanohano testified about helping low-risk pregnant women and
identifying instances where she transferred someone to receive care at
the hospital but said she’s never experienced any emergency
situations.</p>
<p>Among the other plaintiffs are midwives she has helped train and
women she has aided through birth. Makalani Franco-Francis testified
that she learned about customary birth practices from Kahoʻohanohano,
including how to receive a newborn in kapa, or traditional cloth, and
cultural protocols for a placenta, including taking it to the ocean or
burying it to connect a newborn to its ancestral lands.</p>
<p>The law has halted her education, Franco-Francis said. She testified
that she’s not interested in resuming her midwifery education through
out-of-state or online programs.</p>
<p>“It’s not in alignment with our cultural practices, and it’s also a
financial obligation,” she said.</p>
<p>The judge heard testimony through the week. It’s not clear how soon a
ruling might come.</p>

<h2 id="cloudnativepg-1.23.2-1.22.4-and-1.21.6-released">CloudNativePG
1.23.2, 1.22.4 and 1.21.6 Released!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
The <strong>CloudNativePG Community</strong> is thrilled to announce a
new update for the <strong>CloudNativePG Operator</strong>, now
available for the supported versions 1.23, 1.22, and 1.21.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to comprehensive refactoring and enhancement activities, we’ve
significantly improved the reliability of our automated End-to-End (E2E)
tests. With contributions from
<a href="https://enterprisedb.com">EDB</a>, we’ve tested the operator on
all major cloud providers, identified several defects, and resolved them
in these new releases, ensuring a more stable and resilient software.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Versions 1.23.2, 1.22.4, and 1.21.6</strong> are patch releases
that contain crucial bug fixes, addressing issues such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Unnecessary reloads and shutdowns of PostgreSQL
</li>
<li>
Excessive CPU usage on fenced instances, due to busy waiting loop
</li>
<li>
The primary instance manager hanging indefinitely after a stop and
subsequent failure
</li>
<li>
Autovacuum not working correctly due to an issue between
<code>hot_standby_feedback</code> and our managed cluster-level
replication slots implementation
</li>
<li>
<code>pgaudit.log_rows</code> not functioning as intended
</li>
</ul>
<p>
With this update, version 1.21 has reached End-of-Life (EOL). Version
1.21.6 marks the final release for the 1.21 minor version.
</p>
<p>
We highly recommend updating the operator at your earliest convenience
to benefit from these improvements and bug fixes.
</p>
<p>
For a detailed list of changes, please refer to the release notes:

<li>
<a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.21/release_notes/v1.21/">Release
notes for 1.21.6</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Additionally, we are pleased to announce that macOS users can now
install the <code>cnpg</code> plugin for <code>kubectl</code> via
Homebrew with the command: <code>brew install kubectl-cnpg</code>.
</p>

<h2>
About CloudNativePG
</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io">CloudNativePG</a> stands as a
groundbreaking open-source Kubernetes Operator designed explicitly for
PostgreSQL workloads. Seamlessly orchestrating the entire life cycle of
a PostgreSQL cluster, CloudNativePG takes charge from bootstrapping and
configuration to ensuring high availability, connection routing, and
comprehensive backup and disaster recovery mechanisms. Leveraging
PostgreSQL’s native streaming replication, CloudNativePG efficiently
distributes data across pods, nodes, and zones, using standard
Kubernetes patterns. This enables seamless scaling of replicas in a
Kubernetes-native manner, with the operator autonomously and safely
reconfiguring replication as needed. Originally conceived and supported
by <a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/">EDB</a>, CloudNativePG
represents a paradigm shift in managing PostgreSQL workloads within
Kubernetes environments.
