New Hydrogen Rules Risk Opening the Door to Methane Offsets</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-09, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTQyMTAwOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NjIyNDU2N30.7zjoExsb5F7GuCYyrHcn860i86ggTQZZtNBQXHOwV8c/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
In late December, the Treasury Department proposed
<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/12/26/2023-28359/section-45v-credit-for-production-of-clean-hydrogen-section-48a15-election-to-treat-clean-hydrogen" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">draft
regulations</a> to implement the Inflation Reduction Act’s generous
hydrogen production tax credit. Under
<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/45V" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Section
45V</a> of the tax code, eligible projects must show that their life
cycle greenhouse gas emissions fall below exacting benchmarks.
Treasury’s final rules will determine how hydrogen projects are allowed
to calculate their emissions and direct the flow of tens of billions of
tax dollars — or more.
</p>
<p>
Most of the discussion that followed focused on the draft rule’s
proposed
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_self">guardrails
for green hydrogen</a>, which is produced from water using clean
electricity. The climate policy community in particular largely approved
of Treasury’s approach, in part because it lays the groundwork for
hourly emissions accounting in the electricity sector — essentially,
making sure that clean energy is being made and used in real time, a
foundational shift needed for deep decarbonization.
</p>
<p>
But when it comes to producing hydrogen from methane — which is how
nearly all hydrogen is made today — Treasury’s draft was incomplete. In
place of a concrete proposal, the draft regulations raised detailed
technical questions about what should be allowed in the final rule.
Among these was the suggestion that hydrogen production from fossil
fuels might qualify for tax credits by using methane offsets. This,
quite simply, would undermine the tax credit’s entire purpose.
</p>
<p>
If the final regulations authorize methane offsets, then the 45V tax
credit could end up subsidizing fossil fuel projects, stifling the
nascent green hydrogen industry and locking in emissions-intensive
infrastructure for decades to come. Just as concerning, authorizing
offsets for the hydrogen production tax credit would also pave the way
for similar treatment in the upcoming implementation of
technology-neutral clean energy production (
<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/45Y" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Section
45Y</a>) and investment tax credits
(<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/48E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Section
48E</a>).
</p>
<p>
To understand how offsets could affect the strategic outlook for the
hydrogen industry, we looked at how the Treasury Department calculates
the life cycle emissions of hydrogen production from natural gas, which
is essentially just methane. Treasury’s draft regulations propose to use
a
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/greet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bespoke
life cycle analysis model</a> to determine whether hydrogen projects
qualify for the tax credit, and if so, what level of support they will
receive.
</p>
<center>
<iframe aria-label="Table" data-external="1" frameborder="0" height="283" id="datawrapper-chart-NYI8f" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NYI8f/1/" style="border: none;" title="Hydrogen Production Tax Credit Tiers" width="600">
</iframe>
</center>
<p>
This model has several important features: It accounts for CO2 emitted
in the process of producing hydrogen from methane, which is
straightforward, as well as methane emissions from upstream gas
production, processing, and pipeline transportation, which is not.
(Unfortunately, it doesn’t include impacts from hydrogen, which itself
is
<a href="https://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/2024/01/08/opportunities-for-hydrogen-tax-credit-rules-to-address-climate-impact-blind-spots/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an
indirect greenhouse gas</a> that contributes to global warming.)
</p>
<p>
The model’s treatment of methane emissions is particularly important.
Although the academic literature suggests
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aar7204" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
national average above 2%</a> and finds impacts
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c06458" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">above
9%</a> in some cases, the model assumes that gas supply chains emit only
0.9% of the methane they deliver. Differences in methane emissions
matter a lot, even when they look small. That’s because methane traps
about 30 times as much heat as CO2 over a 100-year period, so its
calculated CO2-equivalence is that much larger.
</p>
<p>
As a result, Treasury’s proposed approach undercounts the true climate
impacts of hydrogen production, particularly hydrogen made from methane.
Even so, fossil hydrogen production faces a narrow path to qualifying
for the tax credit. For example, a fossil hydrogen project would have to
capture more than 70% of its CO2 emissions and buy enough clean
electricity to power all its operations — either directly as energy or
indirectly as energy credits — even to qualify for the lower tiers of
the tax credit. And even though projects’ actual methane emissions are
likely to be undercounted, the model’s assumptions are enough to
disqualify fossil projects from the highest tax credit tier, which is
substantially more lucrative than any of the others.
</p>
<p>
Because of the difficulty of achieving high CO2 capture rates, some
analysts have argued that fossil hydrogen projects will
<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-45q-45v-low-carbon/704984/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">instead</a>
wind up applying for tax credits under
<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/45Q" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Section
45Q</a> of the IRA, which provides incentives for sequestering CO2
underground without the hydrogen tax credit’s exacting emissions
standards.
</p>
<p>
But a fossil hydrogen project can claim totally different outcomes if
it’s allowed to buy environmental certificates that claim to avoid
methane emissions in the first place, a.k.a. methane offsets. The logic
goes like this: If someone else was going to emit methane to the
atmosphere, but agrees instead to capture and inject it into a gas
pipeline network, then a hydrogen producer can buy a certificate from
that other methane producer representing that same captured gas and
potentially treat their <em>own</em> fossil gas as negative emissions.
</p>
<p>
For example, consider a large dairy that sends cow manure to uncovered
manure lagoons, which produce significant methane emissions. Suppose the
dairy installs a methane capture system and sells credits to a hydrogen
producer, which then claims to have avoided the dairy’s methane
emissions — even if these emissions
<a href="https://law.ucla.edu/news/mitigating-emissions-californias-dairies-considering-role-anaerobic-digesters" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">could
be avoided in other ways</a>, like alternative manure management or
flaring. Because methane is considered almost 30 times more impactful
than CO2 over a 100-year period, the CO2-equivalence of avoiding methane
emissions is larger than the project’s direct CO2 emissions, and
therefore the resulting hydrogen production process gets a negative
carbon intensity score.
</p>
<p>
If your head is spinning at this point, welcome to the world of offsets.
Outcomes depend on counterfactual scenarios that can’t be measured or
observed, burning fossil fuels can supposedly reduce pollution, and even
the verb tenses are hard to parse.
</p>
<p>
Vertigo aside, the practical implications of methane offsets for the
hydrogen production tax credit are enormous. Without methane offsets,
fossil hydrogen projects couldn’t benefit much from the hydrogen tax
credit; even with strict carbon capture and storage pollution controls,
they can’t meet the life cycle requirements for the top tier and would
likely prefer to claim a smaller carbon storage tax credit instead. But
if projects can use methane offsets, they can easily reduce their
calculated emissions to qualify for the top tier of the hydrogen
production tax credit.
</p>
<p>
This would also mean these fossil projects could undercut truly clean
hydrogen projects. Green hydrogen projects that comply with the draft
guardrails will have to invest in novel electrolyzer technologies and
new clean power sources. The top tier of the tax credit provides enough
money to
<a href="https://energyinnovation.org/publication/smart-design-of-45v-hydrogen-production-tax-credit-will-reduce-emissions-and-grow-the-industry/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">make
clean hydrogen projects competitive</a>, but methane offsets are a lot
less expensive than electrolyzers. If fossil producers can qualify with
cheap offsets, they can pocket the difference and outcompete clean
producers who have to invest in costly infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
We set out to estimate the amount of methane offsetting needed to
qualify fossil projects for the top production tax credit tier. You can
review our calculations
<a href="https://osf.io/fmjbt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>;
for the carbon intensity of
<a href="https://theconversation.com/renewable-natural-gas-may-sound-green-but-its-not-an-antidote-for-climate-change-138791" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">putatively
negative</a> emissions feedstocks, we used a conservative estimate that
is about half the level of what
<a href="https://energyathaas.wordpress.com/2024/01/22/cow-poop-is-now-a-big-part-of-california-fuel-policy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">other
researchers use</a>.
</p>
<p>
Remarkably, a fossil hydrogen project without carbon capture could
qualify for the top production tax credit by offsetting just 25% of its
fuel use. And a fossil hydrogen project that abates 90% of its CO2
emissions could earn the top tier of the tax credit if it bought offsets
for just 4% of its fuel use.
</p>

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
So far a lot of the discussion about negative carbon intensity scores
has focused on methane captured from
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/hydrogen/the-biomethane-boondoggle-that-could-derail-clean-hydrogen" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">livestock</a>
<a href="https://blog.ucsusa.org/julie-mcnamara/the-serious-risks-around-treatment-of-biomethane-in-45v/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">manure</a>,
but Treasury’s draft regulations also make reference to the possibility
of capturing “fugitive emissions,” which could include methane emitted
from the oil and gas sector or even from
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2020.1781035" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">coal
mines</a>. If methane offsets are made eligible across a wide range of
fugitive emissions, the hydrogen tax credit — which was designed as a
generous incentive to promote innovation in new technologies — could end
up subsidizing incumbent emitters.
</p>
<p>
Treasury’s hydrogen regulations will also set an important precedent for
how offsets are treated in other government policies. The last set of
tax credits in the IRA, a pair of technology-neutral investment and
production tax credits for clean electricity generation, are under
development this year. It’s great news that soon the U.S. federal
government will support a full range of clean technologies, not just
solar and wind — but not if those policies encourage higher-emitting
activities that claim to be clean through the use of offsets. There are
a few existing markets for methane offsets already, and certain segments
of the economy — particularly the dairy industry — are hungry for more.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the day, the Biden administration faces a similar set of
issues when it comes to producing hydrogen from methane that it did with
clean hydrogen produced from electricity and water. If the tax credits
encourage green hydrogen projects in places where it is difficult to
supply cheap and clean electricity, then those projects risk
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/04/27/clean-hydrogen-tax-credit-stringent-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">becoming
stranded assets</a> when the tax credits expire. Similarly, if the tax
credits encourage hydrogen production from chemical feedstocks and
methane offsets, they will prop up fossil fuel infrastructure that could
keep operating long after the requirement to buy offsets expires.
</p>
<p>
For all the complexity, though, one thing is clear: We won’t get a true
green hydrogen industry if the Treasury Department decides to subsidize
methane offsets — which, when you put it like that, doesn’t make much
sense in the first place.

lawsuit</a> against two writers who were critical of his work. In 2012,
Rand Simberg, a former adjunct scholar at the Competitive Enterprise
Institute, compared Mann to convicted child abuser Jerry Sandusky,
writing that “except for instead of molesting children, he has molested
and tortured data.” Steyn piled on Simberg’s comments and called Mann’s
research “fraudulent.” A jury found the statements were written with
“maliciousness, spite, ill will, vengeance or deliberate intent to
harm,” and awarded Mann more than $1 million in damages. “I hope this
verdict sends a message that falsely attacking climate scientists is not
protected speech,” Mann said.

<li>Researchers set new nuclear fusion energy record
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>European scientists have set a new record for the
amount of energy produced from nuclear fusion: Researchers working at
the Joint European Torus (JET) facility in the U.K. – one of the most
powerful fusion machines in the world – produced 69 megajoules of fusion
energy for five seconds, surpassing the 2021 record of 59 megajoules.
That’s “enough energy to boil about 70 kettles,” according to the

While that might not seem like a lot, experts see it as a sign of
progress toward harnessing the process that powers the sun for abundant
clean energy. But that remains a long way off: The JET experiment used
more energy than it produced, and “building a fusion power plant also
has many engineering and materials challenges,” Aneeqa Khan, a research
fellow in nuclear fusion at the University of Manchester,

facility, which is being decommissioned this year.

<li>Insurance industry taps scientists to help measure growing wilfire
risks
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>The insurance industry is sponsoring research into how
wildfires spread in urban areas, <em>E&amp;E News</em>
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=4b135565ba&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">reported</a>.
The goal is to help insurers better gauge risk as wildfires fueled by a
warming climate increasingly threaten buildings and cause billions in
losses. Most of the costliest wildfires in U.S. history have struck in
the last decade, and “global insured losses between 2011 and 2020 for
wildfires alone were more than five times higher than losses in the
previous three decades.” Not much modeling has been done around how
fires jump from rural to urban areas, or about how different types of
buildings withstand fires, and “the industry is working to get its arms
around the issue so companies can more confidently do business in
fire-prone areas — and incentivize homeowners to do what they can to
draw down the risk.”

Hao Chen, the study’s corresponding author and NJIT chemistry professor.
“What our study demonstrates is a much faster, sensitive and versatile
method that can monitor our drinking water, land, and consumer products
for contamination in minutes.” The team used its rapid detection method
to identify two kinds of PFAS in just 40mg of soil. The process took
less than three minutes.

<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce
yourself?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I originally studied graphic design and illustration in the days before
internet access. In the mid-90s I got online and immediately liked
making websites, and the feeling that the whole world was suddenly much
closer. I’ve been making websites professionally and/or for myself ever
since. For most of the past 20 years I’ve been a freelance
developer/designer. My personal website and blog is at
<a href="https://www.gyford.com">gyford.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
I live in rural Herefordshire, in the UK, having moved from London about
four years ago.
</p>
<p>
My <a href="https://www.gyford.com/phil/about/projects/">personal
projects</a> include <a href="https://www.pepysdiary.com/">The Diary of
Samuel Pepys</a> – the 17th century London diary in blog form – and
<a href="https://ooh.directory/">ooh.directory</a> – a collection of
more than 2000 blogs organised by category. I also have a couple of
sporadically-updated Tumblrs,
<a href="https://crazywalls.tumblr.com">Crazy Walls</a> and
<a href="https://ourincrediblejourney.tumblr.com">Our Incredible
Journey</a>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What's the story behind your blog?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I’ve had a personal website since 1995 but it was only after
<a href="https://www.gyford.com/phil/writing/2020/06/11/weblogs-2000/">going
to SXSW in 2000</a> and meeting a lot of friendly bloggers, that I
started my own blog
</p>
<p>
Originally the site was generated by some code I wrote myself in Perl
(it was that long ago), before I switched to Movable Type. I gradually
added more customisation using PHP to glue together the various parts of
the site. It became unwieldy and Movable Type was becoming less popular
and less supported.
</p>
<p>
In 2018 I rewrote the site from scratch using the Python framework
<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>. As well as my blog
the site now includes: an archive of all the links I’ve posted to
Pinboard; all my Tweets (RIP); all my Flickr photos; a record of every
book I’ve read over 25 years; every gig, movie, play, etc. I’ve been to
over 30+ years; and my music listening via Last.fm.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to
blogging?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
These days I mostly write
<a href="https://interconnected.org/home/2018/07/24/weeknotes">weeknotes</a>,
weekly posts about some things I’ve been doing. For me this has some
benefits over conventional blogging: there’s a rough deadline, which
ensures I post regularly; I write about things that I might not have
devoted an individual post to; and it means I get stuff out of my head
that might otherwise have lingered for weeks, months, or years while I
failed to turn it into a separate post. Often, not much has happened,
but I tell myself that I <a href="https://ianbetteridge.com/">love</a>
<a href="https://walknotes.com/">reading</a>
<a href="https://tomstu.art/">weeknotes</a>
<a href="https://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/">by</a>
<a href="https://matthewsheret.wordpress.com/">friends</a>, no matter
what they have or haven’t done. So it’s fine. If anyone finds it too
boring they don’t have to read it!
</p>
<p>
So, to answer your questions… my weeknotes require no inspiration, just
remembering some things that have happened. It probably takes me an hour
or so to write and edit a post.
</p>
<p>
Occasionally I write posts that aren’t weeknotes but they’ve become
rarer over the years. Sometimes I think I should abandon weeknotes and
post more frequently. Blog posts don’t need to be well researched essays
– I could write two sentences about a TV show I’ve just watched. That’s
OK! That’s what a lot of blog posts were before social media grabbed all
the “dash off a quick post” energy. But last time I tried doing that I
ended up not posting much at all, so I returned to weeknotes, which are
better for me, for now.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe
the physical space influences your creativity?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I don’t see writing blog posts – at least the kinds I write – as being a
special “creative” endeavour that, beyond a certain minimal requirement
of some time and an internet connection, requires a special environment.
If you’ve ever tweeted or posted on Facebook or Instagram or whatever,
you can blog. But not everyone can find the time, energy or peace to
write a blog post every week or whatever, so I’m fortunate in those
respects.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your
tech stack?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
As I mentioned, the site is written using the Python framework Django,
with a tiny amount of Javascript for things like
<a href="https://www.gyford.com/phil/stats/">charts</a>. There’s a
little more detail on the
<a href="https://www.gyford.com/phil/about/site/">About this site</a>

It, along with my other sites, is hosted at
<a href="https://www.mythic-beasts.com/">Mythic Beasts</a> who are
great, with brilliant support.

<p>
<strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would
you do anything differently?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I’d either do much the same or I’d make it <em>much</em> less
complicated, and maybe use WordPress, or something even simpler. My site
is a sprawling morass of custom code, containing a lot of data aside
from the main blog, which is great when I’m in the mood for tinkering
with code but often feels ridiculous and over-complicated. A lot of it
feels like an exercise to show what a personal site <em>could</em> be,
and how much information it <em>could</em> contain, rather than what a
personal site <em>should</em> be.
</p>
<p>
For anyone starting out I think the tricky balance is finding something
that’s (a) simple and maintainable, but (b) lets you own your own data.
A hosted service is the most simple and least technical but you’re then
more beholden to the company running it.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how
much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it
generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising
personal blogs?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I used to host the site on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>
which cost US$15-20/month. I now have
<a href="https://www.mythic-beasts.com/servers/virtual">a VPS at Mythic
Beasts</a> containing three websites which works out at about the same
as if I ran each of them on Heroku separately. I could run them more
cheaply, but I pay for extra support because I have no interest in, or
knowledge about, running a server.
</p>
<p>
I don’t have a problem with anyone monetising personal blogs, depending
on how it’s done. Memberships, Patreons, etc, all seem fine if it helps.
I don’t need to generate money from my personal site and I’d start to
feel beholden to readers if I did (assuming anyone was willing to pay).
</p>
<p>
After 20 years of running The Diary of Samuel Pepys, this year I set up
<a href="https://ko-fi.com/pepysdiary">a Ko-fi page</a> to cover the
costs of hosting and the
<a href="https://buttondown.email/pepysdiary">daily emails</a> which has
worked smoothly and
<a href="https://www.pepysdiary.com/news/2024/01/03/14116/">been
helpful</a>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth
checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing
next?</strong>

<h4>
It’s not NTP. There’s no way it’s NTP. It was NTP

<p>
<strong>Interview</strong>  Back in late 2010, “Zimmie” was working in
IT support for a vendor that made VPN devices and an associated
operating system. He got a call on a Monday from a customer – a large
specialty retailer in the US – about its VPN hardware that had stopped
working over the weekend.…

<h2 id="oddµ-namespaces-and-live-updating">2024-02-09 Oddµ namespaces

<p>date: 2024-02-09, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
2024-02-09 Oddµ namespaces and live updating
</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>
It’s a slow morning. I had my two cups of coffee, ate my pancakes with
plum jam, spent time online reading Mastodon, talked to my wife about
wannabe-axe murderers on Swiss trains, looked up stuff about
<a href="https://www.tax-the-rich.eu/">taxing the rich</a>…
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’ve been working on Oddmu again. My goal is to be able to reproduce the
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/">Campaign Wiki</a> setup:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
people can get a “space” for their site by signing up in some way
</li>
<li>
they can make changes to the look and feel of their site (change the
headers, footers, colours, i.e. make changes to both the HTML template
and the CSS)
</li>
<li>
feeds, list of changes and all that are limited to their site
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Using Oddmu would also result in the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
sites are no longer publically editable (which isn’t a requirement for
such spaces like role-playing game campaigns)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Oddmu now has the following features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
when editing pages in a subdirectory, the <code>index</code> and
<code>changes</code> page in the same directory are updated (instead of
the root directory)
</li>
<li>
when HTML templates exist in the same directory, those are used instead
of the templates in the root directory
(e.g. <a href="oddmu/index">Oddµ</a>)
</li>
<li>
when uploading a HTML template, it is loaded immediately (no more server
restart)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once I had this implemented using a library that watches the filesystem
for changes, I realized that I could use the same feature to index new
pages. This brings me closer to having online and offline writing
feature equivalence: Using the web site to create a page should be
equivalent to writing a page elsewhere and uploading it to the site via
rsync. (Offline you can use the <code>oddmu notify</code> command to add
links to <code>index</code>, <code>changes</code> and hashtag pages.)
</p>
<p>
I think I’m getting close!

<p>date: 2024-02-09, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I thought I was beyond shockable, but this week has been profoundly shocking for me. I spent the bulk of my adult life on the right-wing side of things, generally rooting for the Republican Party, because I thought that party best served America. People like Sarah Palin and Donald Trump chased me out of the Republican orbit (gradually and then all at once), but I have still held out the hope that my many friends on the right are kind of like an occupied country. They have to mouth the Trumpian prejudices to survive in this era, but somewhere deep inside, the party of Reagan still lives in their souls.&lt;/p&gt;

<h2 id="african-penguin-chicks-hatch-at-san-francisco-museum">10 African
Penguin Chicks Hatch at San Francisco Museum</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO — A bounty of 10 African penguin chicks has hatched in
just over a year at a San Francisco science museum as part of an effort
to conserve the endangered bird.</p>
<p>The penguins began hatching in November 2022, ending a four-year
period without any new chicks, and continued through January of this
year, the California Academy of Sciences announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>African penguins have dwindled to 9,000 breeding pairs in the wild,
the academy said in a statement.</p>
<p>Threats such as overfishing, habitat degradation and oil spills have
reduced colonies of the charismatic black-and-white birds, said Brenda
Melton, director of animal care and well-being at the museum’s Steinhart
Aquarium.</p>
<p>“Every chick we welcome strengthens the genetics and overall
population of the species in human care,” she said.</p>
<p>Chicks spend their first three weeks with their penguin parents in a
nest box. They then attend “fish school,” where they learn to swim on
their own and eat fish provided by biologists. Once ready, they are
introduced to the colony.</p>
<p>The 21 penguins at the museum in Golden Gate Park have distinct
personalities and are identifiable by their flipper bands, according to
the academy’s website.</p>
<p>Opal is the oldest and, at age 36, has perfected the ability to catch
fish in mid-air. Her partner, Pete, is a messy eater and a flirt.</p>
<p>Partners Stanlee and Bernie, who both like to bray, produced four of
the 10 chicks, including Fyn, named for a type of vegetation found on
the southern tip of Africa. Fyn is the youngest on exhibit and older
sister to Nelson and Alice, both hatched in November.</p>
<p>Fyn often runs up to biologists when they enter the habitat and
shakes her head at them — typical courtship behavior that chicks and
juveniles commonly display toward people who have cared for them since
hatching.</p>
<p>The youngest chick hatched January 12, and its sex has not yet been
determined.</p>
<p>African penguins can live to be 27 years old in the wild, and longer
in captivity.</p>

<p>I’m on the road again, and was happily writing away on a couple of
interesting stories tonight when I saw my laptop battery was almost
gone. Went to plug it in, and realized I did not pack my charger.
Tonight, therefore, is an emergency picture. It’s miserable for this to
happen mid-draft, but the good news is that there is no news that isn’t
part of a much longer story, so nothing is breaking (and yes, I’m saying
that even though I have read the entire 388-page report about President
Biden’s handling of classified documents— that’s where the battery
went).</p>

Denies Claims of Poor Document Handling, Contrasts Case with
Trump’s</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday pushed back on
claims he incorrectly handled sensitive government documents, forcefully
contrasting his case with that of former President Donald Trump – and
drawing a contrast with Trump’s own high-stakes legal travails the same
day the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case that could remove Trump
from the presidential race.</p>
<p>Biden, at turns defiant and bitterly jocular with the reporters
called in for the last-minute remarks Thursday evening, strongly
disputed that he “willfully” retained and shared classified materials,
as was said in a report released earlier in the day.</p>
<p>“These assertions are not only misleading, they’re just plain wrong,”
he said.</p>
<p>The report by special counsel Robert Hur concluded that no criminal
charges should be brought, and that many of the classified documents
found in Biden’s offices and home were kept by mistake.</p>
<p>In a statement earlier in the day, Biden said he was “pleased” the
special counsel had “reached the conclusion I believed all along they
would reach — that there would be no charges brought in this case and
the matter is now closed.”</p>
<p>That evening, he parried questions over a section of the report in
which the author described the 81-year old president as “a sympathetic,
well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”</p>
<p>“I’m well-meaning and I’m an elderly man and I know what the hell I’m
doing,” Biden replied to a reporter who asked after his memory and cited
voters’ concerns over his age. “I’ve been president, I put this country
back on its feet. I don’t need his recommendation.”</p>
<p>Bob Bauer, Biden’s personal lawyer, also pushed back on the report in
a statement, accusing Hur of “trashing” the investigation’s subject
“with extraneous, unfounded and irrelevant critical commentary.”</p>
<p>“The special counsel could not refrain from investigative excess,
perhaps unsurprising given the intense pressures of the current
political environment,” Bauer’s statement read. “Whatever the impact of
those pressures on the final report, it flouts department regulations
and norms.”</p>
<p>Biden’s detractors weighed in within the hour.</p>
<p>“The President’s press conference this evening further confirmed on
live television what the Special Counsel report outlined,” Speaker of
the House Mike Johnson posted on the social media platform X, formerly
known as Twitter. “He is not fit to be President.”</p>
<p>Biden is not the only president to face criticism over his handling
of documents. In 1973, a Washington Post reporter who had had lunch in
1970 with then-former President Lyndon B. Johnson, wrote that “the
ex-President came prepared with the goods in the form of stacks of
papers marked TOP SECRET and TOP SECRET SENSITIVE. Over and over, he
read from the various memoranda, letters and other documents to back up
his positions.”</p>
<p>Trump faces 40 felony counts over his alleged mishandling of
classified documents after he left office.</p>
<p>Trump, in a statement, said the Biden case was “100 times different
and more severe than mine.” He added: “I did nothing wrong, and I
cooperated far more.”</p>
<p>Trump’s case is the first federal indictment of a U.S. president. He
has pleaded not guilty.</p>

<h2 id="biden-says-israels-response-in-gaza-is-over-the-top">Biden Says
Israel’s Response in Gaza is ‘Over the Top’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>white house — President Joe Biden on Thursday gave his sharpest
criticism yet of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s military
campaign, which has killed more than 27,000 Palestinians, according to
health officials in Gaza.</p>
<p>“I’m of the view, as you know, that the conduct of the response in
Gaza, in the Gaza Strip, has been over the top,” Biden said in response
to a reporter’s question at the White House.</p>
<p>Biden said he has been “pushing very hard” for a temporary cease-fire
in exchange for the release of hostages held by Hamas and freeing of
Palestinians in Israeli jails. On Wednesday, Netanyahu rejected the
deal, calling the terms proposed by Hamas “delusional.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been working tirelessly in this deal,” Biden said, adding that
he believes it could be extended to a “sustained pause in the
fighting.”</p>
<p>He said he has been pushing to increase humanitarian assistance into
Gaza.</p>
<p>“As you know, initially, the president of Mexico, Sissi, did not want
to open up the gate to allow humanitarian material to get in,” Biden
said, mistakenly referring to Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.
“I talked to him. I convinced him to open the gate. And talked to Bibi
[Netanyahu] to open the gate on Israeli side.”</p>
<p>Biden said this during hastily scheduled remarks in response to a
special counsel report released Thursday. The report concluded he
willfully retained and disclosed classified military and national
security information and cited his memory lapses – a concern for
American voters ahead of the November presidential election.</p>
<p>Three-quarters of voters, including half of Democrats, say they have
concerns about Biden’s mental and physical health, according to an NBC
News poll released this week.</p>
<p>“My memory is fine,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Warning on Rafah</p>
<p>Earlier Thursday, the White House issued a stern warning to Israel,
cautioning the Netanyahu government against carrying its military
campaign into the city of Rafah along the border with Egypt, where more
than half of Gaza’s population of 2.2 million people have taken
shelter.</p>
<p>“Absent any full consideration of protecting civilians at that scale
in Gaza, military operations right now would be a disaster for those
people, and it’s not something that we would support,” said National
Security Council spokesperson John Kirby during a White House
briefing.</p>
<p>His comments echoed those of U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres,
who warned earlier Thursday of the risk of a “gigantic tragedy” as the
Palestinians crammed in Rafah “have nowhere to go.”</p>
<p>Kirby underscored the administration does not believe Israel is about
to conduct imminent military operations in Rafah, saying it has not
“seen any convincing plans” for such an advance.</p>
<p>This despite Netanyahu saying on Wednesday that his government had
instructed the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to “operate also in Rafah,”
as well as Khan Younis, the two places he identified as the “two last
strongholds of Hamas.”</p>
<p>Israel is unlikely to swiftly move into Rafah as long as the IDF
continues fighting in Khan Younis and around its tunnels, where it
thinks that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, a native of Khan Younis, is
hiding, said David Makovsky, the Ziegler distinguished fellow at the
Washington Institute and director of the Koret Project on Arab-Israel
Relations.</p>
<p>“I think Netanyahu and [Israeli Defense Minister Yoav] Gallant want
to signal that Israel is not afraid of going into Rafah,” he told VOA.
“But I think we are still talking about the signaling phase.”</p>
<p>As Palestinians in Rafah shelter in fear of a more intensive campaign
and ground assault, Israeli forces bombed areas of the city, killing at
least 11 people.</p>
<p>Cairo concerned</p>
<p>Cairo is concerned that an Israeli advance into Rafah could lead to a
mass effort by Gazans to escape across the border, a spokesperson for
Egypt’s Foreign Ministry said Thursday.</p>
<p>Washington also worries that the conflict could spread into Egypt,
said Jonathan Rynhold, head of the Department of Political Studies at
Bar-Ilan University.</p>
<p>“What could happen here with the relationship with Egypt? What will
happen if the Palestinians try and rush into Egypt? How are you going to
deal with that? Those are the kinds of questions that are being asked
[by the U.S. to the Israelis],” Rynhold told VOA.</p>
<p>Despite its increasingly blunt public warnings to Israel, the U.S.
remains a staunch supporter of Israel’s military campaign to eliminate
Hamas.</p>
<p>So far Biden has refrained from using Washington’s considerable
leverage, said Aaron David Miller, senior fellow at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace with experience in Middle East peace
negotiations under various U.S. administrations.</p>
<p>That leverage includes the possibility of reducing military aid or
diplomatic support at the United Nations, where more than 150 countries
have called for a cease-fire.</p>
<p>“Those levers have been available since the beginning of this crisis,
but he hasn’t pulled any of them,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>Kirby pushed back against questions about why Biden would not do more
to rein in Netanyahu.</p>
<p>The notion that the administration has not tried to influence the way
the Israelis have been prosecuting military operations is “just not
true,” Kirby told VOA during Thursday’s briefing. “And they’ve been
receptive to many of our lessons learned and perspectives we share.”</p>
<p>Rynhold said Biden is likely withholding U.S. leverage for when he
may need to restrain Israel from broadening the conflict, particularly
against Lebanon.</p>
<p>Hezbollah-led forces have been attacking Israeli communities and
military posts along the Lebanon-Israel border on a near-daily basis
since the October 7 attack by Hamas that killed 1,200 people in
Israel.</p>
<p>Cease-fire</p>
<p>The White House said it is optimistic that there is still a path
toward a temporary cease-fire, despite Netanyahu’s public dismissal of
the plan that highlighted the divide between the two allies.</p>
<p>Kirby said that “conversations are still happening” and Biden is
“optimistic.” Biden is set to meet with Jordan’s King Abdullah in
Washington next week as part of his push for a deal.</p>
<p>The Carnegie Endowment’s Miller warned that a deal may be elusive
because “neither Hamas nor the Israelis right now are really
interested.”</p>
<p>“There’s no urgency for either of them in a comprehensive sort of
cessation of hostilities,” he said. “The only people that appear to be
in a hurry is the Biden administration.”</p>
<p>Biden is facing intense backlash from Arab and Muslim Americans. In
an effort to repair relations, his aides met Thursday with Arab American
and Muslim leaders in Michigan.</p>
<p>The state has a high percentage of Muslims, and their votes could
determine whether the president can hold on to the crucial swing state
in the November presidential election.</p>
<p>VOA U.N. Correspondent Margaret Besheer contributed to this
report.</p>

<h2 id="us-defends-airstrikes-as-iraqi-anger-mounts">US Defends
Airstrikes as Iraqi Anger Mounts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Pentagon — The United States is giving no indication of relenting
after its latest airstrike in Iraq — targeting an Iranian-backed militia
commander in downtown Baghdad — sparked renewed anger and fresh calls
for the removal of U.S. troops from the country.</p>
<p>Instead, officials in Washington on Thursday defended Tuesday’s
strike and warned that the U.S. would not hesitate to act again should
its forces come under further attacks.</p>
<p>“We fully respect Iraq’s sovereignty,” White House National Security
Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters. “But, look, if there
were no attacks on our troops, who are there at the invitation of the
Iraqi government, there would be no need for retaliatory strikes.”</p>
<p>Multiple U.S. military officials sent a similar message from the
Pentagon.</p>
<p>“If you attack and you hurt our people, we know who you are, and we
will find you,” said General Daniel Hokanson, the U.S. National Guard
bureau chief, regarding the U.S. response to last month’s attack on a
base in Jordan that killed three soldiers and injured 40 National Guard
troops.</p>
<p>“There will be a bill to pay much greater than anything that was left
on us,” he added.</p>
<p>The U.S. has blamed Iranian-backed militias, operating under the
banner of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, for the deadly attack on the
Tower 22 base in Jordan, as well as for many of the 168 attacks on U.S.
forces in Iraq and Syria dating to mid-October.</p>
<p>Washington’s gaze, in particular, has fallen on Kataib Hezbollah,
with some Pentagon officials going as far as to say that the attack in
Jordan “bears the hallmarks” of the prominent Iranian-backed group.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s airstrike targeted senior Kataib Hezbollah commander Wisam
Mohammad al-Saedi.</p>
<p>Initial U.S. statements said al-Saedi was “responsible for directly
planning and participating in attacks on U.S. forces in the region.” But
a U.S. official said Thursday that he was the top Kataib Hezbollah
official for Syria, overseeing all operations in the country.</p>
<p>The strike killing al-Saedi followed a wave of airstrikes last Friday
on seven locations used by the Iranian-backed militias in Syria and
Iraq.</p>
<p>U.S. defense officials now believe those strikes destroyed more than
80 individual targets and killed or wounded 40 militia members.</p>
<p>Yet the repeated strikes have stoked growing anger among Iraqi
officials.</p>
<p>Iraqi military spokesman Yehia Rasool early Thursday called the
strike that killed al-Saedi “a blatant assassination” that showed “no
regard for civilian lives or international laws.”</p>
<p>“The trajectory compels the Iraqi government more than ever to
terminate the mission of this coalition, which has become a factor for
instability and threatens to entangle Iraq in the cycle of conflict,” he
said in a statement posted on social media.</p>
<p>A social media post from the office of Iraqi Prime Minister Mohamed
Shia al-Sudani likewise indicated it was time for U.S. troops, and those
from the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State terror group, to
leave.</p>
<p>The prime minister “highlighted Iraq’s enhanced capabilities in
combating terrorism, leading to the decision to end the coalition’s
mission as ISIS terrorist remnants no longer pose a threat to Iraq,” the
post said, using an acronym for the Islamic State, also known as IS or
Daesh.</p>
<p>The U.S. has about 2,500 troops in Iraq tasked with advising and
assisting Iraqi Security Forces as they pursue the remnants of IS.
Another 900 U.S. forces are stationed in Syria, charged with the same
mission.</p>
<p>And while the U.S. has been in talks with Iraq about eventually
reducing the U.S. military footprint and transitioning from the
counter-IS mission, officials suggested Thursday that the time has not
yet come.</p>
<p>“In Iraq and Syria, they are down, but they’re not out,” said
Pentagon press secretary Major General Patrick Ryder. “And so, again,
this work by an international coalition continues to try to prevent a
resurgence.”</p>
<p>Ryder further called IS “insidious” when it comes to taking advantage
of turmoil, adding, “It’s obviously not helpful when you have things
like Iranian proxies attacking your forces that are there for that
mission.”</p>
<p>U.S. counterterrorism and intelligence officials have estimated there
are fewer than 2,000 IS fighters across Iraq and Syria, though some key
allies have recently warned the terror group is resurging, carrying out
more attacks while seeing its ranks grow.</p>
<p>It is a warning the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF,
repeated Thursday.</p>
<p>“We have seen a spike in movements of ISIS,” said SDF commander
General Mazloum Abdi, talking to reporters in Washington by video link
from his headquarters in northeastern Syria.</p>
<p>Abdi also warned that the group is “taking a benefit” from the
constant attacks by the Iranian-backed militias, who have started
targeting SDF positions in addition to their drone and missile attacks
on U.S. forces.</p>
<p>“We do not have any protection measures against them,” he said
through a translator, adding that the SDF has requested anti-drone
defense systems from Washington.</p>
<p>One attack, against the SDF base at the Omar Oil Field this past
Sunday, killed six SDF fighters.</p>
<p>Abdi said another drone attack came close to hitting a prison in
Hasakah, one of dozens of facilities holding a total of about 9,000
captured IS fighters. He said one drone hit the prison’s roof, but that
fortunately, U.S. forces downed the other three before they could do
more serious damage.</p>
<p>Despite the precarious situation, the SDF commander said he was not
worried U.S. forces would be leaving in the short term.</p>
<p>“We have been reassured by United States officials … there’s not
going to be any withdrawal [from Syria] anytime soon,” Abdi said,
warning that should the U.S. change course, the result would be
chaos.</p>
<p>“Many actors, forces, will be trying to take advantage,” he said.
“U.S. presence on the ground is a main factor maintaining balance
here.”</p>

Patsy Widakuswara contributed to this report.</p>

names new CEO as it pivots to data privacy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Mozilla Corp., which manages the open-source Firefox browser,
announced today that Mitchell Baker is stepping down as CEO to focus on
AI and internet safety as chair of the nonprofit foundation. Laura
Chambers, a Mozilla board member and entrepreneur with experience at
Airbnb, PayPal, and eBay, will step in as interim CEO to run operations
until a permanent replacement is found. Baker, a Silicon Valley pioneer
who co-founded the Mozilla Project, says it was her decision to step
down as CEO, adding that the move is motivated by a sense of urgency
over the current state of the internet and public trust. “We want to
offer an alternative for people to have better products,” says Baker,
who wants to draw more attention to policies, products and processes to
challenge business models built on fueling outrage. “What are the
connections between this global malaise and how humans are engaging with
each other and technology?” ↫ Diane Brady for Fortune Mozilla is in such
a tough spot. They basically have zero consumer appeal, have no
recognisable products other than Firefox, and effectively exist by the
grace of Google, of all companies. If Mozilla gets in even more trouble,

release</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>For the past few months we have been working hard to provide a fast,
reliable and secure KVM backend for VirtualBox. VirtualBox is a
multi-platform Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) with a great feature set,
support for a wide variety of guest operating systems, and a consistent
user interface across different host operating systems. Cyberus
Technology’s KVM backend allows VirtualBox to run virtual machines
utilizing the Linux KVM hypervisor instead of the custom kernel module
used by standard VirtualBox. Using KVM comes with a number of benefits.
↫ Florian Pester, Markus Partheymüller Excellent news. Dealing with the
VirtualBox and VMware kernel modules can be a hassle if you’re using
newer or custom kernels, and having the VirtualBox UI for kvm instead of
things virt-manager is not something I’m unhappy about.</p>

formally announces sudo for Windows</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>After earlier sightings, Microsoft has now formally announced sudo
for Windows. We’re excited to announce the release of Sudo for Windows
in Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 26052! Sudo for Windows is a new way
for users to run elevated commands directly from an unelevated console
session. It is an ergonomic and familiar solution for users who want to
elevate a command without having to first open a new elevated console.
We are also excited to announce that we are open-sourcing this project
here on GitHub! We’re working hard to add more information about the
project in the GitHub repo and will be sharing more details about our
plans in the coming months! If you’re looking for additional
functionality that Sudo for Windows does not provide, check out Gerardo
Grignoli’s gsudo which has a number of additional features and
configuration options. ↫ Jordi Adoumie on the official Windows blog In
response to sudo coming to Windows, Theo de Raadt announced that Word is
coming to OpenBSD.</p>

I was your age, if you’re in your late teens or early 20s, there was
nothing remotely like Apple Music or Spotify. If we wanted to listen to
a specific album we’d have to buy a copy of the vinyl record at a music
store. I used to go to a store called
<a href="https://www.themushroomnola.com/">Mushroom Too</a>, on
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Zimpel+St+%26+Broadway+St,+New+Orleans,+LA+70118/@29.941399,-90.1285116,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x8620a51059b4faf3:0xdf6e23353b2d059d!8m2!3d29.9413944!4d-90.1236461!16s%2Fg%2F11h9w_9m9_?entry=ttu">Broadway
and Zimpel</a> in New Orleans. It was kind of like a head shop, smelled
of incense, and they had a great sound system and they were always
playing good music. It was on the second floor above a bar called
<a href="http://thebootnola.com/About.html">The Boot</a> that had the
usual college stuff, beer, burgers, pinball. The record store had rows
of racks of albums, like a library in a way, and you’d wander around
looking for bands you knew or had heard about, and you’d stare at album
covers, front and back and try to decide. Looking for “something good to
listen to.” And you could only afford a certain number every year, so
you listened to each album a lot. I don’t know if it works that way for
young folk today. In 50 years when you’re looking back will you know the
songs in the order they appeared on the album? I never bought singles,
by the time I came along

in New York. I’d listen to the student station at Tulane,
<a href="https://www.wtulneworleans.com/">WTUL</a>. They’d play longer
songs, and not always the most popular song on an album. You got the
sense that the DJ was being creative with the songs they chose. BTW,

Senate Hearing Was a Pretty Great Example of Climate Policy-Making</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTQyMjY1OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1ODk3ODMwOH0.oe5-idtW5glFoKk43XYNDnxio3MUhZhAWVd-wucBz5g/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
In the sort of happy coincidence that is only possible in Washington,
D.C., two consequential linguistic debates unfolded on Thursday morning
within half a mile of each other. The first, in the Supreme Court of the
United States, commanded the attention of major TV networks and
political pundits, warranted a live blog from <em>The New York
Times</em>, and aimed, in part, to differentiate between what
constitutes an “insurrection” versus
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/02/08/us/trump-supreme-court-colorado-ballot/94892b07-cb09-5c9c-b8c9-86946561e5c0?smid=url-share" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
mere “riot.”</a>
</p>
<p>
A five-minute walk away, in room 366 of the Dirksen Senate Office
Building, a similar debate was unfolding — albeit after some
<a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/hearings/2024/2/full-committee-hearing-to-examine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">live-stream
technical difficulties</a> and
<a href="https://twitter.com/lindsey_byman/status/1755602141388099671" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
brief protest</a> by the climate group Third Act. The event didn’t
elicit quite the same level of national intrigue as the hullabaloo on
the other side of Constitution Avenue; in fact, I never saw more than
173 other people watching the feed along with me at any given point. The
senators’ debate, though, was an important one, and it centered largely
on the meaning of the word “pause.”
</p>
<p>
If that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/house-lng-hearing-ukraine-emissions" target="_self">sounds
familiar</a>, it’s because Republicans on the House Energy, Climate, and
Grid Security Subcommittee had a similar debate earlier this week about
the Biden administration’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/biden-lng-export-trump-campaign" target="_self">pause
on approving new permits</a> for facilities to export liquified natural
gas. But while that hearing had been a silly (and at times, infuriating)
example of the GOP’s contorted defenses of the oil and gas industry, the
Senate Energy and Natural Resources hearing on the LNG pause felt a
little more meaningful. Ironically, that’s partially because nothing
really was said.
</p>
<p>
Called by
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/joe-manchin-retiring-west-virginia-senator-inflation-reduction-act" target="_self">cantankerous</a>
West Virginia Democrat and committee Chairman Joe Manchin, the Senate
hearing took place in two parts: The first and most interesting saw
Deputy U.S. Energy Secretary David Turk make the first on-the-record
defense of the export terminal pause by a Biden administration official.
In contrast, the second part called as witnesses a European gas
executive and an LNG industry advocate, each of whom made predictable
noises about the threat of energy volatility in the face of revanchist
Russia.
</p>
<p>
Though Manchin, in his opening remarks, said he “strongly” urged the
Biden administration to reverse the export terminal permitting pause
“immediately,” he and other skeptical senators appeared to be at least
partially open to Turk’s opinion on everything from whether “it is wise
to give our allies and partners and neutral parties across the world an
excuse to do business with our enemies” to how long the DOE’s
re-evaluation of what it means for a new export terminal to be “in the
public interest” would take.
</p>
<p>
They appeared less satisfied with Turk’s unwillingness to give them firm
answers, however. Regarding LNG export terminals supporting European
energy security, Turk explained, “We need to look at how much we’ve
already authorized, how much we’re already in the process of
authorizing, and compare that to what our allies absolutely need.” When
pressed about a timeline for the length of the pause and the DOE’s
decision-making, he committed to “months, not years” but stressed “there
are a lot of questions,” and rigorous analysis takes time. Later, James
Watson, a witness and executive of Eurogas, suggested Turk had been
unforthcoming because he’d been “asked to explain the unexplainable,
which is not easy to do.”
</p>
<p>
In fact, Turk’s deferrals underscored <em>why</em> a pause is so
necessary, something further drawn out during a rare back-and-forth
between senators following a comment by Manchin. “If we were talking
about considering a pause, this is a great, great panel for it. But you
have an executive order doing a pause: that’s the difference,” Manchin
said.
</p>
<p>
“I think it’s just the opposite, Mr. Chairman,” Maine Democrat Angus
King pushed back. The DOE is “doing their job and their job is to see
that these projects are in the public interest. There’s no way to do
that without the data.”
</p>
<p>
“You can’t do the pause first, though,” Manchin said.
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” King responded. If you don’t pause first, “then you’re
approving projects when you find out, five years from now, that it was a
disaster.”
</p>
<p>
There are a lot of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-1-lng" target="_self">valid
and complicated questions about LNG</a>, which will take time to answer.
But hot air loves a vacuum, especially in Washington, and Republicans
have seized the opportunity to spin the pause as a “ban” or a “stop” —
as in, “basically, you’re stopping things,” in the words of Alaska
Republican Lisa Murkowski. But “nobody’s talking about stopping,” King
later pointed out during the second witness panel after Turk had left.
“We’re talking about taking a period of time in order to do the
necessary research.”
</p>
<p>
That, after all, is the unsexy truth of climate policymaking: It isn’t
exciting. There aren’t cameras waiting outside for shouted questions.
It’s not covered by liveblogs or cable news chyrons. Maybe only 173
people will even bother to take time out of their mornings to
troubleshoot where the live stream has migrated to when it doesn’t
appear on the committee website. So, while “pause” is an easy word to
throw around and even easier to exaggerate, what it should mean in
practice is <em>to</em> <em>do the math and do it right</em>.
</p>
<p>
Turk repeatedly said the DOE welcomes debate, including with a
forthcoming public comment period on its findings. Even Manchin seemed
to embrace the disagreements and nuances of the topic at hand. “I
enjoyed that!” he exclaimed on a hot mic after Turk’s testimony and his
back-and-forth with King.
</p>
<p>
That doesn’t mean anyone changed anyone else’s mind on Thursday; I don’t
think Manchin was more dissuaded than when he woke up this morning that
the Biden administration had “put the cart before the horse” even in
simply taking a break on LNG approvals. But in a rare absence of
political theater on the Hill, a government official said there’s still
more to learn and debate, and everyone seemed to agree.

High School Students Visit China on Invitation of Xi Jinping</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Muscatine, Iowa — Muscatine, Iowa, High School student Cole Loos had
never traveled beyond the United States when the question put before him
in January was, “Would you like to go to China?”</p>
<p>“I was lucky I had my passport to go,” Loos explained to VOA. </p>
<p>The invitation, he learned, wasn’t for a date in the distant
future. If he and 24 other students from his high school were to make
the trip, they had less than 10 days to commit and prepare to fly.</p>
<p>“It was very spontaneous,” Loos said.</p>
<p>Spontaneous, but by no means an accident.</p>
<p>In 1985, Sarah Lande hosted a group from China visiting Muscatine for
several days on an agricultural research tour of the United States. One
of the participants was Xi Jinping, now president of the People’s
Republic of China. Then, Xi was party committee secretary of Zhengding
County, Hebei Province.  Lande helped organize his stay in
Muscatine.</p>
<p>“Good things happen when you are a good friend to people, I guess,”
Lande said during a recent interview in her Muscatine home, where in
2012, Xi — by then vice president of China — returned to visit his “old
friends” from Iowa. </p>
<p>“Old friend” is a common phrase China’s communist party uses as a
tribute to foreigners considered helpful to their interests. It’s also
an expression of nostalgia for longtime companions or acquaintances.</p>
<p>During Xi’s 2012 reunion with the “old friends” he met during his
first trip to the U.S., they spent an evening in front of a warm fire in
Lande’s living room remembering their eventful visit some 30 years
earlier.</p>
<p>Then last November, Lande was invited to a dinner on the sidelines of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco. In his
remarks at the event, Xi expressed his desire to welcome thousands of
American students to China, prompting Lande to follow up with a letter
to her “old friend.” </p>
<p>“And I got a reply to that letter,” she explained.</p>
<p>So, Lande took the opportunity to advocate for Muscatine.</p>
<p>“I hope Muscatine could be a part of this. So, that probably was the
incentive for this invite,” she said.</p>
<p>In January, the China Daily reported that Xi was extending a personal
invitation for students and staff from Muscatine High School to come to
China. </p>
<p>The invitation came with few strings attached to the all-expenses
paid trip. They spent eight days visiting with local students, touring
the Great Wall of China and other landmarks and cities, and participated
in a conference for students learning the Mandarin language.</p>
<p>The trip comes amid increased tensions between the United States and
China in the wake of tariffs imposed on the communist country during the
Trump administration; the overflight of a Chinese observation balloon
across the United States in early 2023; China’s warming relations with
Russia’s Vladimir Putin amid the ongoing war in Ukraine; and the
country’s ongoing human rights abuses of the predominately Muslim Uyghur
minority in China’s western territories.</p>
<p>“Both of our countries, you could say, are trying to be number one,”
Lande says. “I think our challenge is to grow a curiosity and
understanding and find ways to work together.”</p>
<p>She believes trips and culture exchanges build bridges and encourage
dialogue that could lead to change.</p>
<p>“I hope if there are ways that we find that China is really
transgressing, we can at least bring that up, so it will not lead to
conflict,” she said.</p>
<p>Loos said it was hard to find any sign of U.S.- China tensions during
their trip.</p>
<p>“You felt very special over there,” said Loos, who is in his second
year of Mandarin language studies at Muscatine High School.  </p>
<p>“Actually, I’m very, very proud of them. Seems like they grew
super-fast in a few days,” said Heidi Kuo, Loos’ Mandarin teacher. </p>
<p>Kuo is originally from Taiwan and accompanied the students on the
trip.  Of the many lessons they learned, she hopes one stands out. </p>
<p>“The world is super big, not only us here,” she said.</p>
<p>Ann Edkin grew up in Muscatine, which has a population of about
23,000 and is situated along the banks of the Mississippi River. She now
teaches physical education at Muscatine High School and was one of four
staff members who made the trip to China. </p>
<p>She thinks the connection between her small town and China’s leader
is a baffling but welcome relationship.</p>
<p>“The fact that he came here, that’s cool,” she told VOA.  “But to
have that ongoing relationship, it’s not just a blip, but a continuing
relationship that makes it so unique and special.”</p>
<p>As more students prepare for more trips to China, Lande’s next goal
is to encourage her “old friend” to return to Muscatine, which she
thinks is a perfect location for a future summit with U.S. President Joe
Biden. </p>
<p>“We’re open,” she said. “Xi Jinping is open. He might be willing to
come here. I think Biden would. Muscatine would welcome it!”</p>
<p>A potential venue could be the Muscatine home where Xi stayed in
1985, now preserved as a museum — mostly visited by Chinese
tourists.</p>

<h2 id="the-great-list-of-all-the-blog-platforms">The great list of all
the blog platforms</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
Pretentious title, I know. It’s obviously tongue-in-cheek but it’s at
least partly what I’m gonna try to do with this post. Blogs are back.
They never went anywhere but still, they’re back. Many people
will—hopefully—ditch social media and start a blog in the near future.
Almost as many people will ask themselves which
tool/platform/incantation they should use to start said blog. I’m gonna
do my part and try to collect here all the possible alternatives. I am
100% certain that this list won’t be exhaustive but it’s a start. If you
have suggestions to improve it,
<a href="mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com">email me</a>.
</p>
<p>
As always, if you find what I do here useful or entertaining in any way
you can hop on the <a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">1$/mo
bandwagon</a>.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
The following is a list of tools and platforms that are primarily
designed to run blogs. Now, it goes without saying that you can build a
blog using pretty much every CMS out there. Hell, you can make a blog
without a CMS and just upload html files on a server. This is not going
to be a list of all the possible ways you can make a blog, it’s a list
of tools and services designed with blogs in mind. The list is in no
particular order.
</p>
<p>
A note on the prices: most services usually offer a limited free plan. I
decided to ignore those and list the price for the lowest tier
available, paid monthly.

Big Tech disrupted disruption (08 Feb 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Big Tech disrupted disruption: We don’t have to care,
we’re the phone company. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This
day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent
publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects,
current reading Big Tech disrupted disruption (permalink) Before
“disruption” turned into a punchline, it was a genuinely exciting idea.
Using technology, we could connect people to one another and allow them
to collaborate, share, and cooperate to make great things happen. It’s
easy (and valid) to dismiss the “disruption” of Uber, which “disrupted”
taxis and transit by losing $31b worth of Saudi royal money in a bid to
collapse the world’s rival transportation system, while quietly
promising its investors that it would someday have pricing power as a
monopoly, and would attain profit through price-gouging and wage-theft.
Uber’s disruption story was wreathed in bullshit: lies about the
“independence” of its drivers, about the imminence of self-driving
taxis, about the impact that replacing buses and subways with millions
of circling, empty cars would have on traffic congestion. There were and
are plenty of problems with traditional taxis and transit, but Uber
magnified these problems, under cover of “disrupting” them away. But
there are other feats of high-tech disruption that were and are
genuinely transformative – Wikipedia, GNU/Linux, RSS, and more. These
disruptive technologies altered the balance of power between powerful
institutions and the businesses, communities and individuals they
dominated, in ways that have proven both beneficial and durable. When we
speak of commercial disruption today, we usually mean a tech company
disrupting a non-tech company. Tinder disrupts singles bars. Netflix
disrupts Blockbuster. Airbnb disrupts Marriott. But the history of
“disruption” features far more examples of tech companies disrupting
other tech companies: DEC disrupts IBM. Netscape disrupts Microsoft.
Google disrupts Yahoo. Nokia disrupts Kodak, sure – but then Apple
disrupts Nokia. It’s only natural that the businesses most vulnerable to
digital disruption are other digital businesses. And yet…disruption is
nowhere to be seen when it comes to the tech sector itself. Five giant
companies have been running the show for more than a decade. A couple of
these companies (Apple, Microsoft) are Gen-Xers, having been born in the
70s, then there’s a couple of Millennials (Amazon, Google), and that one
Gen-Z kid (Facebook). Big Tech shows no sign of being disrupted, despite
the continuous enshittification of their core products and services. How
can this be? Has Big Tech disrupted disruption itself? That’s the
contention of “Coopting Disruption,” a new paper from two law profs:
Mark Lemley (Stanford) and Matthew Wansley (Yeshiva U):
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4713845 The paper
opens with a review of the literature on disruption. Big companies have
some major advantages: they’ve got people and infrastructure they can
leverage to bring new products to market more cheaply than startups.
They’ve got existing relationships with suppliers, distributors and
customers. People trust them. Diversified, monopolistic companies are
also able to capture “involuntary spillovers”: when Google spends money
on AI for image recognition, it can improve Google Photos, YouTube,
Android, Search, Maps and many other products. A startup with just one
product can’t capitalize on these spillovers in the same way, so it
doesn’t have the same incentives to spend big on R&amp;D. Finally, big
companies have access to cheap money. They get better credit terms from
lenders, they can float bonds, they can tap the public markets, or just
spend their own profits on R&amp;D. They can also afford to take a long
view, because they’re not tied to VCs whose funds turn over every 5-10
years. Big companies get cheap money, play a long game, pay less to
innovate and get more out of innovation. But those advantages are
swamped by the disadvantages of incumbency, all the various curses of
bigness. Take Arrow’s “replacement effect”: new companies that compete
with incumbents drive down the incumbents’ prices and tempt their
customers away. But an incumbent that buys a disruptive new company can
just shut it down, and whittle down its ideas to “sustaining innovation”
(small improvements to existing products), killing “disruptive
innovation” (major changes that make the existing products obsolete).
Arrow’s Replacement Effect also comes into play before a new product
even exists. An incumbent that allows a rival to do R&amp;D that would
eventually disrupt its product is at risk; but if the incumbent buys
this pre-product, R&amp;D-heavy startup, it can turn the research to
sustaining innovation and defund any disruptive innovation. Arrow asks
us to look at the innovation question from the point of view of the
company as a whole. Clayton Christensen’s “Innovator’s Dilemma” looks at
the motivations of individual decision-makers in large, successful
companies. These individuals don’t want to disrupt their own business,
because that will render some part of their own company obsolete
(perhaps their own division!). They also don’t want to radically change
their customers’ businesses, because those customers would also face
negative effects from disruption. A startup, by contrast, has no
existing successful divisions and no giant customers to safeguard. They
have nothing to lose and everything to gain from disruption. Where a
large company has no way for individual employees to initiate major
changes in corporate strategy, a startup has fewer hops between
employees and management. What’s more, a startup that rewards an
employee’s good idea with a stock-grant ties that employee’s future
finances to the outcome of that idea – while a giant corporation’s stock
bonuses are only incidentally tied to the ideas of any individual
worker. Big companies are where good ideas go to die. If a big company
passes on its employees’ cool, disruptive ideas, that’s the end of the
story for that idea. But even if 100 VCs pass on a startup’s cool idea
and only one VC funds it, the startup still gets to pursue that idea. In
startup land, a good idea gets lots of chances – in a big company, it
only gets one. Given how innately disruptable tech companies are, given
how hard it is for big companies to innovate, and given how little
innovation we’ve gotten from Big Tech, how is it that the tech giants
haven’t been disrupted? The authors propose a four-step program for the
would-be Tech Baron hoping to defend their turf from disruption. First,
gather information about startups that might develop disruptive
technologies and steer them away from competing with you, by investing
in them or partnering with them. Second, cut off any would-be
competitor’s supply of resources they need to develop a disruptive
product that challenges your own. Third, convince the government to pass
regulations that big, established companies can comply with but that are
business-killing challenges for small competitors. Finally, buy up any
company that resists your steering, succeeds despite your resource war,
and escapes the compliance moats of regulation that favors incumbents.
Then: kill those companies. The authors proceed to show that all four
tactics are in play today. Big Tech companies operate their own VC
funds, which means they get a look at every promising company in the
field, even if they don’t want to invest in them. Big Tech companies are
also awash in money and their “rival” VCs know it, and so financial VCs
and Big Tech collude to fund potential disruptors and then sell them to
Big Tech companies as “aqui-hires” that see the disruption neutralized.
On resources, the authors focus on data, and how companies like Facebook
have explicit policies of only permitting companies they don’t see as
potential disruptors to access Facebook data. They reproduce internal
Facebook strategy memos that divide potential platform users into
“existing competitors, possible future competitors, [or] developers that
we have alignment with on business models.” These categories allow
Facebook to decide which companies are capable of developing disruptive
products and which ones aren’t. For example, Amazon – which doesn’t
compete with Facebook – is allowed to access FB data to target shoppers.
But Messageme, a startup, was cut off from Facebook as soon as
management perceived them as a future rival. Ironically – but
unsurprisingly – Facebook spins these policies as pro-privacy, not
anti-competitive. These data policies cast a long shadow. They don’t
just block existing companies from accessing the data they need to
pursue disruptive offerings – they also “send a message” to would-be
founders and investors, letting them know that if they try to disrupt a
tech giant, they will have their market oxygen cut off before they can
draw breath. The only way to build a product that challenges Facebook is
as Facebook’s partner, under Facebook’s direction, with Facebook’s veto.
Next, regulation. Starting in 2019, Facebook started publishing
full-page newspaper ads calling for regulation. Someone ghost-wrote a
Washington Post op-ed under Zuckerberg’s byline, arguing the case for
more tech regulation. Google, Apple, OpenAI other tech giants have all
(selectively) lobbied in favor of many regulations. These rules covered
a lot of ground, but they all share a characteristic: complying with
them requires huge amounts of money – money that giant tech companies
can spare, but potential disruptors lack. Finally, there’s predatory
acquisitions. Mark Zuckerberg, working without the benefit of a ghost
writer (or in-house counsel to review his statements for actionable
intent) has repeatedly confessed to buying companies like Instagram to
ensure that they never grow to be competitors. As he told one colleague,
“I remember your internal post about how Instagram was our threat and
not Google+. You were basically right. The thing about startups though
is you can often acquire them.” All the tech giants are acquisition
factories. Every successful Google product, almost without exception, is
a product they bought from someone else. By contrast, Google’s own
internal products typically crash and burn, from G+ to Reader to Google
Videos. Apple, meanwhile, buys 90 companies per year – Tim Apple brings
home a new company for his shareholders more often than you bring home a
bag of groceries for your family. All the Big Tech companies’ AI
offerings are acquisitions, and Apple has bought more AI companies than
any of them. Big Tech claims to be innovating, but it’s really just
operationalizing. Any company that threatens to disrupt a tech giant is
bought, its products stripped of any really innovative features, and the
residue is added to existing products as a “sustaining innovation” – a
dot-release feature that has all the innovative disruption of rounding
the corners on a new mobile phone. The authors present three
case-studies of tech companies using this four-point strategy to
forestall disruption in AI, VR and self-driving cars. I’m not excited
about any of these three categories, but it’s clear that the tech giants
are worried about them, and the authors make a devastating case for
these disruptions being disrupted by Big Tech. What do to about it? If
we like (some) disruption, and if Big Tech is enshittifying at speed
without facing dethroning-by-disruption, how do we get the dynamism and
innovation that gave us the best of tech? The authors make four
suggestions. First, revive the authorities under existing antitrust law
to ban executives from Big Tech companies from serving on the boards of
startups. More broadly, kill interlocking boards altogether. Remember,
these powers already exist in the lawbooks, so accomplishing this goal
means a change in enforcement priorities, not a new act of Congress or
rulemaking. What’s more, interlocking boards between competing companies
are illegal per se, meaning there’s no expensive, difficult fact-finding
needed to demonstrate that two companies are breaking the law by sharing
directors. Next: create a nondiscrimination policy that requires the
largest tech companies that share data with some unaffiliated companies
to offer data on the same terms to other companies, except when they are
direct competitors. They argue that this rule will keep tech giants from
choking off disruptive technologies that make them obsolete (rather than
competing with them). On the subject of regulation and compliance moats,
they have less concrete advice. They counsel lawmakers to greet tech
giants’ demands to be regulated with suspicion, to proceed with caution
when they do regulate, and to shape regulation so that it doesn’t limit
market entry, by keeping in mind the disproportionate burdens
regulations put on established giants and small new companies. This is
all good advice, but it’s more a set of principles than any kind of
specific practice, test or procedure. Finally, they call for increased
scrutiny of mergers, including mergers between very large companies and
small startups. They argue that existing law (Sec 2 of the Sherman Act
and Sec 7 of the Clayton Act) both empower enforcers to block these
acquisitions. They admit that the case-law on this is poor, but that
just means that enforcers need to start making new case-law. I like all
of these suggestions! We’re certainly enjoying a more activist set of
regulators, who are more interested in Big Tech, than we’ve seen in
generations. But they are grossly under-resourced even without giving
them additional duties. As Matt Stoller points out, “the DOJ’s Antitrust
Division has fewer people enforcing anti-monopoly laws in a $24 trillion
economy than the Smithsonian Museum has security guards.”

What’s more, Republicans are trying to slash their budgets even further.
The American conservative movement has finally located a police force
they’re eager to defund: the corporate police who defend us all from
predatory monopolies. (Image: Cryteria, CC BY 3.0, modified) Hey look at

<h2 id="us-regulator-bans-ai-generated-voices-in-robocalls">US Regulator
Bans AI-Generated Voices in Robocalls</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Thursday
outlawed robocalls that contain artificial intelligence-generated
voices, citing their capacity to misinform voters.</p>
<p>The ruling, which takes effect immediately, targets robocalls made
with AI voice-cloning tools under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.
The 1991 law regulates junk calls that use artificial and prerecorded
voice messages.</p>
<p>“Bad actors are using AI-generated voices in unsolicited robocalls to
extort vulnerable family members, imitate celebrities, and misinform
voters. We’re putting the fraudsters behind these robocalls on notice,”
FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement announcing the
unanimous decision.</p>
<p>The ruling will give state attorneys general new tools to target
perpetrators behind these calls “and ensure the public is protected from
fraud and misinformation,” Rosenworcel said in the statement.</p>
<p>The ruling comes after AI-generated robocalls that impersonated
President Joe Biden sought to discourage people from voting in the New
Hampshire primary election last month. The New Hampshire attorney
general announced this week that the calls were traced to companies in
Texas.</p>
<p>“We need to protect voters from deepfake AI technology
disenfranchising them or manipulating their thought processes,” Theresa
Payton, CEO of cybersecurity company Fortalice Solutions, told VOA.</p>
<p>“This is a step in the right direction, and I would like to see more
debate and open discussion on what the guard rails for the usage of this
technology should be,” added Payton, who previously served as the White
House’s Chief Information Officer during the George W. Bush
administration.</p>
<p>Under the new regulation, the FCC can fine companies that use AI
voices in their calls or block the service providers that carry the
calls.</p>
<p>The agency has previously used the law to hold robocallers
accountable for election interference, including imposing a $5 million
fine on two conservative hoaxers who used robocalls to try to reduce
Black voter turnout in the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p>Deepfake AI technology has also been used in attempts to influence
voters around the world.</p>
<p>Just days before elections in Slovakia in September 2023, for
instance, a deepfake audio circulated online imitating a politician who
appeared to be discussing how to rig the election.</p>
<p>The FCC had been considering banning AI voices in robocalls due to a
rise it saw in these types of calls. In January, a bipartisan group of
26 state attorneys general urged the FCC to go ahead with a ruling.</p>
<p>While the ruling is a positive development, according to Payton, she
added that there still may be the threat of foreign forces using
AI-generated robocalls in attempts to influence elections.</p>
<p>“This is going to be helpful as it relates to American political
operatives, but I am not clear how this would be enforced against
non-Americans that may choose to abuse this technology and interfere in
our political process,” she said.</p>

<h2 id="we-breached-1.5-degrees-celsius-of-warming-sort-of">We Breached
1.5 Degrees Celsius of Warming — Sort Of</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTQyMDU2My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MDcxOTQ1N30.bhRbG10knf753rxXafUmjOjUSxE-uvfe6qGdlbMDRts/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
Somewhat fittingly, Heatmap’s first year in existence coincided with the
planet’s first 12-month period with an average temperature
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/year-warming-paris-agreement" target="_blank">more
than 1.5 degrees Celsius</a> above pre-industrial levels, according to a
new
<a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-2024-world-experienced-warmest-january-record" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>
from the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. This might not come as
a surprise if you’ve been reading us for any amount of time. But still,
the number is striking — it’s the target we’ve long heard about, the
threshold that the Paris Agreement is trying to keep us under.
</p>
<p>
It might be easy, then, to look at this report with a bit of despair. I
am here to tell you otherwise. Some things to keep in mind:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
For starters, this report does not mean we’ve missed the Paris
Agreement’s target; Copernicus’ report covers average temperatures over
one year, while the Paris Agreement’s targets operate on 20- or 30-year
timescales.
</li>
<br/>
<li>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/neutral-weather-enso-nino-nina" target="_self">El
Niño</a> was also a factor. The warm ocean phenomenon tends to bring
higher global temperatures, so it’s possible the average could dip back
down in a La Niña year (which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration says is probably
<a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/ensodisc.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on
its way soon</a>).
</li>
<br/>
<li>
This threshold is not a point of no return. As I wrote in my
<a href="https://heatmap.news/culture/smithsonian-natural-history-koch-fossils" target="_self">very
first piece</a> for Heatmap, humanity operates on stunningly compressed
time scales compared to the rest of our planet. It didn’t take us very
long to reach this point; similarly, the speed of our efforts to
decarbonize will affect the speed at which we will return to more
livable temperatures.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If anything, think of today’s number news as a call to action. The last
year was a preview of what life could be like above 1.5 degrees C; the
next few years will likely also be incredibly hot compared to
pre-industrial levels, and we must do our best to mitigate the pain and
loss to come.
</p>
<p>
We’ll be covering those efforts at Heatmap, as we always do, but if
you’d like an idea of the various paths available to us for
decarbonization,
<a href="https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/one-point-five-pathways/index.html" target="_blank">this
Carbon Brief interactive</a> is a good place to start.

<p>Casting doubts on his political rivals’ eligibility to run for the
U.S. presidency is one of Republican frontrunner and former President
Donald Trump’s key campaign strategies. Fellow candidate Nikki Haley is
the latest target of what is known as “birtherism.” VOA’s Veronica

id="special-counsel-biden-willfully-disclosed-classified-materials-but-no-criminal-charges-warranted">Special
Counsel: Biden ‘Willfully’ Disclosed Classified Materials, But No
Criminal Charges Warranted</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden “willfully” retained and
disclosed highly classified materials when he was a private citizen,
including documents about military and foreign policy in Afghanistan and
other sensitive national security matters, according to a Justice
Department report that nonetheless says no criminal charges are
warranted for him or anyone else. </p>
<p>The report from special counsel Robert Hur, released Thursday,
represents a harshly critical assessment of Biden’s handling of
sensitive government materials but also details the reasons why he
should not be charged with the crime. </p>
<p>The findings will likely blunt his ability to forcefully condemn
Donald Trump, Biden’s likely opponent in November’s presidential
election, over a criminal indictment charging the former president with
illegally hoarding classified records at his Mar-a-Lago estate in
Florida. </p>
<p>“Our investigation uncovered evidence that President Biden willfully
retained and disclosed classified materials after his vice presidency
when he was a private citizen,” Hur wrote. </p>
<p>Hur’s report says evidence suggests that many of the classified
documents recovered by investigators at the Penn Biden Center, in parts
of Biden’s Delaware home and in his Senate papers at the University of
Delaware were retained by “mistake.” </p>
<p>Biden said in a statement that he was “pleased” the special counsel
had “reached the conclusion I believed all along they would reach — that
there would be no charges brought in this case and the matter is now
closed.” </p>
<p>He made a point of saying that he sat for five hours of in-person
interviews over two days on October 8 and 9, “even though Israel had
just been attacked on October 7th and I was in the middle of handling an
international crisis.” </p>
<p>“I just believed that’s what I owed the American people so they could
know no charges would be brought and the matter closed,” Biden
said. </p>
<p>The report comes after a yearlong investigation into the improper
retention of classified documents by Biden, from his time as a senator
and as vice president, that were found at his Delaware home, as well as
at a private office that he used in between his service in the Obama
administration and becoming president. </p>
<p>The investigation into Biden is separate from special counsel Jack
Smith’s inquiry into the handling of classified documents by Trump after
Trump left the White House. Smith’s team has charged Trump with
illegally retaining top secret records at his Mar-a-Lago home and then
obstructing government efforts to get them back. Trump has said he did
nothing wrong. </p>
<p>After Biden’s lawyers uncovered classified documents at his former
office, Biden’s representatives promptly contacted the National Archives
to arrange their return to the government. The National Archives
notified the FBI, which opened an investigation. Biden made his homes
available to agents to conduct thorough searches, and that is how the
most sensitive documents came to the attention of the Justice
Department. </p>
<p>Hur assessed that the evidence did not support that Biden willfully
retained some of the classified documents that were recovered —
including the ones at the Penn Biden Center that sparked the probe. </p>
<p>Biden could not have been prosecuted as a sitting president, but
Hur’s report states that he would not recommend charges against Biden,
regardless. </p>
<p>“We would reach the same conclusion even if Department of Justice
policy did not foreclose criminal charges against a sitting president,”
the report said. </p>
<p>Part of the report centers on Biden’s handling of classified
documents about Afghanistan — specifically, the Obama administration’s
decision to send additional troops there — that he retained in is
Delaware home after he left office as vice president. Biden preserved
materials documenting his opposition to the troop surge, including a
2009 classified handwritten memo to then-President Barack Obama. </p>
<p>“These materials were proof of the stand Mr. Biden took in what he
regarded as among the most important decisions of his vice presidency,”
the report said. </p>
<p>The documents have classification markings up to the Top
Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information Level and were found in a box
in Biden’s Delaware garage “that contained other materials of great
significance to him and that he appears to have personally used and
accessed.” </p>
<p>Photographs included in the report showed some of the classified
Afghanistan documents in a worn cardboard box stored in his garage,
apparently in a loose collection with other household items, including a
ladder and a wicker basket. </p>
<p>Classified documents from the Obama administration were also found in
Biden’s basement den, according to the report. Classified documents from
his time in the Senate in the 1970s and 1980s were also found in his
garage. </p>
<p>Despite signs that Biden knowingly retained and disclosed classified
materials, Hur’s report said criminal charges were not merited for
multiple reasons. Those include the fact that as vice president, and
during his subsequent presidency when the Afghanistan records were
found, “he had the authority to keep classified documents at his
home.” </p>
<p>As part of the probe, investigators reviewed a recording of a
February 2017 conversation between Biden and his ghostwriter in which,
referring to the 2009 memo to Obama, Biden said he had “just found all
the classified stuff downstairs.” Biden was renting a home in Virginia
at the time and consolidated his belongings in Delaware when he moved
out in 2019. Prosecutors believe Biden’s comment was a reference to the
same classified records that FBI agents later found in his Delaware
home. </p>
<p>Although the best case for charges could involve his possession of
the Afghanistan documents as a private citizen, prosecutors said, it was
possible that Biden could have found those records at his Virginia home
in 2017 and then forgotten about them soon after. </p>
<p>“This could convince some reasonable jurors that he did not retain
them willfully,” the report. </p>
<p>The report said there was some evidence to suggest that Biden knew he
could not keep classified handwritten notes at home after leaving
office, citing his deep familiarity “with the measures taken to
safeguard classified information and the need for those measures to
prevent harm to national security.” Yet he kept notebooks containing
classified information in unlocked drawers at home. </p>
<p>“He had strong motivations to do so and to ignore the rules for
properly handling the classified information in his notebooks,” the
report said. “He consulted the notebooks liberally during hours of
discussions with his ghostwriter and viewed them as highly private and
valued possessions with which he was unwilling to part.” </p>
<p>While the report removes legal jeopardy for the president, it is
nonetheless an embarrassment for Biden, who placed competency and
experience at the core of his rationale to voters to send him to the
Oval Office. </p>
<p>“Mr. Biden was known to remove and keep classified material from his
briefing books for future use, and his staff struggled — and sometimes
failed — to retrieve those materials,” the report states. “And there was
no procedure at all for tracking some of the classified material
Mr. Biden received outside of his briefing books.” </p>
<p>In declining to prosecute Biden, Hur’s office also cited what it said
was Biden’s “limited memory” both during his 2017 recorded conversations
with the ghostwriter and in an interview with investigators last
year. </p>
<p>“Given Mr. Biden’s limited precision and recall during his interviews
with his ghostwriter and with our office, jurors may hesitate to place
too much evidentiary weight on a single eight-word utterance to his
ghostwriter about finding classified documents in Virginia, in the
absence of other, more direct evidence. </p>
<p>There is recent Justice Department precedence for criminal charges
against individuals accused of sharing classified information with
biographers or ghostwriters. General David Petraeus pleaded guilty to
doing exactly that in 2015 and was sentenced to probation. </p>
<p>Yet in this instance, prosecutors say, Biden could have plausibly
believed that the notebooks were his personal property and belonged to
him, even if they contained classified information. </p>
<p>In an interview with prosecutors, the report said, Biden was emphatic
with investigators that the notebooks were “my property” and that “every
president before me has done the exact same thing.” </p>
<p>White House lawyer Richard Sauber said Biden takes classified
information seriously and “strives to protect it,” but making mistakes
when packing documents at the end of an administration can be a common
occurrence, as the report noted. </p>
<p>“We disagree with a number of inaccurate and inappropriate comments
in the special counsel’s report. Nonetheless, the most important
decision the special counsel made — that no charges are warranted — is
firmly based on the facts and evidence,” Sauber said. </p>
<p>Biden’s personal attorney Bob Bauer accused the special counsel of
violating “well-established’ norms and”trashing” the president. </p>
<p>“The special counsel could not refrain from investigative excess,
perhaps unsurprising given the intense pressures of the current
political environment. Whatever the impact of those pressures on the
final report, it flouts department regulations and norms,” he said in a
statement. </p>
<p>Trump responded to the report in a statement as he traveled to Nevada
for Thursday evening’s Republican caucuses. “THIS IS A TWO-TIERED SYSTEM
OF JUSTICE!” he said in a statement, claiming the Biden case was “100
times different and more severe than mine.” </p>
<p>“I did nothing wrong, and I cooperated far more. What Biden did is
outrageously criminal - He had 50 years of documents, 50 times more than
I had, and”WILLFULLY RETAINED” them,” Trump added, once again claiming
“ELECTION INTERFERENCE!” </p>
<p>White House lawyers and Biden’s personal attorney were given the
opportunity to review and comment on the report. Biden chose not to
assert executive privilege over any portion of the report, White House
counsel’s office spokesman Ian Sams said. </p>
<p>Attorney General Merrick Garland in January 2023 named Hur, a former
U.S. attorney for Maryland, to handle the politically sensitive Justice
Department inquiry in an attempt to avoid conflicts of interest. It is
one of three recent Justice Department investigations into the handling
of classified documents by politically prominent figures.</p>

It’s not a bug in your RSS reader if recent articles in this feed all
suddenly appeared as unread. You may even have seeming duplicates.
</p>
<p>
Sorry about that! It’s due to my changing settings in my blog generator.
Pages now have a .html suffix where before they had none. This change
impacts permalinks, which also changes the <code>guid</code>s in my RSS
feed — and NetNewsWire and other RSS readers use the <code>guid</code>
property to identify articles, which means these will show up as new
articles.

<h2 id="jury-duty-is-self-government">Jury duty is self-government</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Jury duty is an intensive bootcamp for American democracy.
</p>
<p>
The great thing about jury duty is you get a very clear sense of what
self-government is about. It makes you feel empowered which can be even
more uncomfortable than feeling powerless.
</p>
<p>
So much of the frenetic activity online is about that sense of
powerlessness. So we give money to causes or we join in boycotts, but
these aren’t as powerful as participating in governing. Jury duty is a
very quick way to do that.
</p>
<p>
We have to act more like citizens and less like subjects. I think that’s
the real message of the election of 2016. Subjects elect someone like
Trump. People who think like citizens would elect someone very
different.

Go Up: Inside Crypto’s Wild Rise and Staggering Fall</i></a> is entitled
“Pig Butchering”. It starts when he receives a supposed wrong-number

<blockquote>
I showed my phone to my friend and explained that I was stringing Vicky
along because I’d heard about a new kind of investment fraud that often
started with a random text message. I had a hunch that this was why
“Vicky” was texting me. The scam was called “pig butchering” because the
scammers liked to build up the victim’s confidence with a pretend
romantic relationship and made-up investment gains before stealing all
their money in one fell swoop—like how hogs are fattened up before their
slaughter.

Faux strung “Vicky” along
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Number-Go-Up-Cryptos-Staggering-ebook/dp/B0BYV2Y3XT/ref=sr_1_1">and</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
My short-lived texting flirtation with Vicky confirmed something that I
had suspected: The scammers were using Tether to move the money. I spoke
with several other pig-butchering victims, and they said they’d been
asked to send Tether too.<br /> …<br /> From the scammer’s perspective,
Tether was a clear improvement on bribing bankers or money mules. It was
instant, there was no recourse for refunds, and it didn’t ask for
anyone’s name or address. And unlike other cryptocurrencies, its value
didn’t fluctuate from hour to hour, making it less scary for potential
victims and easier to manage for criminals.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Number-Go-Up-Cryptos-Staggering-ebook/dp/B0BYV2Y3XT/ref=sr_1_1">How
much Tether are we talking?</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
News stories revealed that people were losing huge amounts of money. A
project finance lawyer in Boston with terminal cancer handed over $2.5
million. A divorced mother of three in St. Louis was defrauded of $5
million. A twenty-four-year-old social media producer in Tennessee lost
$300,000 she inherited from the sale of her childhood home.<br />
…<br /> I came across a group that claimed to be raising money dedicated
to helping victims. It was called the Global Anti-Scam Organization. The
group said it had helped a huge number of pig-butchering victims: 1,483
worldwide, who’d lost more than $250 million combined.
</blockquote>
Despite Tether’s ability to
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/what-happens-when-tether-freezes-your-tether-5a8ece2bd508">freeze
wallets</a>,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Number-Go-Up-Cryptos-Staggering-ebook/dp/B0BYV2Y3XT/ref=sr_1_1">Faux
writes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Icetoad and other volunteers from the Global Anti-Scam group told me
that Tether refused to help them by freezing accounts or seizing stolen
money, even when presented with evidence that an account held the
proceeds of fraud.<br /> …<br /> In another exchange provided by Global
Anti-Scam, Tether told a Hong Kong police official that it did have the
ability to intervene. But the company still refused, saying the case was
too small. “We must sometimes decline fraud cases involving relatively
small amounts of stolen USDT,” the Tether representative wrote, using
the ticker symbol for the cryptocurrency. It said they would only
intervene if the case was “directly connected to acts of violence.”
</blockquote>
Faux got Rich Sanders of CipherBlade to trace his
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Number-Go-Up-Cryptos-Staggering-ebook/dp/B0BYV2Y3XT/ref=sr_1_1">payment
to “Vicky”</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
a small dark circle represented Vicky Ho’s wallet. This was where I’d
sent the eighty-one Tethers. Sanders explained that the wallet was
active for about two months and received many deposits from addresses
that were known to be associated with U.S. and Canadian Canadian crypto
exchanges. There were transfers of $3,600, $180, $400, $500, and $9,774,
always in Tether. These were other people who’d been scammed by the same
operation, Sanders said. In other words, I wasn’t Vicky’s only love
interest. Once Vicky Ho had collected the money, they sent it to another
numbered address, represented on the screen by a larger white circle.
This one was likely controlled by the scammers too, Sanders said, and it
held $9.4 million in Tethers. From there, many of the Tethers were sent
to addresses associated with the crypto exchange Binance, and to others
that belonged to Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Number-Go-Up-Cryptos-Staggering-ebook/dp/B0BYV2Y3XT/ref=sr_1_1">Global
Anti-Scam told Faux that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
most butchering scams were orchestrated by gangsters based in Cambodia
or Myanmar. These bosses would lure young men and women from across
Southeast Asia to move abroad with the promise of well-paying jobs in
customer service or online gambling. Then, when the workers arrived,
they’d be held captive and forced to work on online scams. Icetoad and
his colleagues told me there were thousands of people who’d been tricked
this way. Entire office towers were filled with floor after floor of
people forced to send spam messages around the clock, under threat of
torture or death. These were the people using Tether to move their
money.
</blockquote>
His next chapter recounts his trip to Cambodia to see the pig-butchering
campuses. Like the rest of the book, it is well worth reading.
Conditions in these campuses were
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-08-17/crypto-text-message-scams-lead-back-to-cambodia-slave-labor">horrific</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Workers who missed quotas were beaten, starved, made to hit one another.
One said he’d seen people forcibly injected with methamphetamine to
increase productivity. Two others said they’d seen workers murdered,
with the deaths passed off as suicides. They said the bosses would buy
and sell captive laborers like livestock.<br /> …<br /> Local news
reports described a string of suspicious deaths near Chinatown—one body
was found hanging at a construction site, and another corpse was dug up
handcuffed from a shallow grave in a field nearby. A local vendor told a
Cambodian outlet that there had been many suicides at the complex. “If
an ambulance doesn’t go inside at least twice a week, it is a wonder,”
he said.

Faux wasn’t alone in reporting on the pig-butchers. Poppy McPherson and
Tom Wilson of Reuters published a special report entitled
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/fintech-crypto-fraud-thailand/"><i>Crypto
scam: Inside the billion-dollar ’’pig-butchering‘‘ industry</i></a>.
They traced funds flowing to Wang Yicheng in Bangkok:<br />
<blockquote>
At a Thai police headquarters in October 2022, Chinese businessman Wang
Yicheng congratulated one of Bangkok’s most senior cybercrime
investigators on his recent promotion, presenting the official with a
large bouquet of flowers wrapped in red paper and a bow.<br /> <br />
Wang, the vice president of a local Chinese trade group, wished the new
cybercrime investigator “smooth work and new achievements,” according to
the group’s website, which displays photographs of the event.<br />
<br /> Over the past two years, Wang has forged relationships with
members of Thailand’s law-enforcement and political elite, the trade
group’s online posts show. During that time, a cryptocurrency account
registered in Wang’s name was receiving millions of dollars linked to a
type of cryptocurrency investment scam known as pig butchering, a
Reuters investigation has found.<br /> <br /> In total, crypto worth
more than $90 million flowed into the account between January 2021 and
November 2022, according to registration documents and transaction logs
reviewed by Reuters. Of that, at least $9.1 million came from a crypto
wallet that U.S. blockchain analysis firm TRM Labs said was linked to
pig-butchering scams. Two other major crypto-tracking firms also said
the account received funds linked to such scams.<br /> …<br /> Lisa
Wolk, a blockchain intelligence analyst at TRM, said the crypto account
in Wang’s name “is a node in a money laundering network and not
necessarily the ultimate recipient of funds.” Reuters was unable to
determine whether anyone else benefited from the account or used Wang’s
identity to open it.<br />
</blockquote>
Where was
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/fintech-crypto-fraud-thailand/">Wang’s
account?</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The crypto account registered to Wang was held at Binance, the world’s
largest crypto exchange, according to three blockchain analysis firms.
Asked about the account, Binance spokesperson Jessica Jung declined to
comment on individual users or Reuters’ findings. In an August post on
its website, the company said the number of reports of pig-butchering
scams it had received this year was double that of 2022, an increase it
attributed to an influx of inexperienced crypto investors and scammers
looking to exploit them.<br /> …<br /> In April, the U.S. Department of
Justice said it seized about $112 million worth of crypto linked to
pig-butchering scams, without identifying suspects. A warrant that
resulted in the seizure of more than half that amount specified a
Binance account registered in Thailand.<br />
</blockquote>
Wang’s account moved a
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/fintech-crypto-fraud-thailand/">lot
of Tether</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The crypto account in Wang’s name was registered in November 2020,
according to the financial records Reuters reviewed. The three
blockchain-analysis firms determined the account was with Binance. The
documents, which relate to the Binance account, span two years to
November 2022. They show that the account was accessed mostly from
Bangkok.<br /> <br /> Deposits started arriving in the account in early
2021 and quickly increased in size to include sums of more than
$100,000, the financial records show.<br /> …<br /> In 2022, the volume
of crypto reaching the account in Wang’s name mushroomed to almost $79
million, a near six-fold increase on the previous year, the account
records seen by Reuters show.<br /> <br /> Coinfirm, the blockchain
analysis firm that reviewed the transaction records for Reuters, said
deposits from funds linked to pig-butchering scams it previously
investigated began entering the account as early as February 2022.
Stolen crypto was moved to the account via a “complex layering scheme,”
involving multiple different wallets, Coinfirm’s then-head of fraud
investigations Roman Bieda told Reuters in May. The crypto moved between
“dozens” of wallets and was mixed with funds from other sources, he
said.<br /> <br /> More than $102,000 originating from fraudsters’
wallets that the California man identified were deposited into the
account in Wang’s name between June 26 and Oct. 23, 2022, according to
Coinfirm.<br /> <br /> Nearly all of the crypto deposited in the
Wang-registered account was moved to other wallets, the transaction
records reviewed by Reuters show. Between January 2021 and October 2022,
about $87.5 million was transferred to almost 50 other crypto wallets,
including at least five registered at regionally based crypto exchanges,
Coinfirm said.
</blockquote>
The pigs weren’t
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/fintech-crypto-fraud-thailand/">butchered
in Bangkok</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Several scams connected to deposits made into the account in Wang’s name
were run from an industrial park on the Myanmar-Thai border, one of the
blockchain analysis firms told Reuters. Workers are trafficked to the
area, known as KK Park, by gangs that force them to con people online,
according to two former workers and groups that support workers or scam
victims.<br />
</blockquote>
This was clearly a different pig abattoir from the Cambodia-based one
Faux investigated.<br /> <br /> A more detailed account of tracing the
money flows of the pig butchers can be found in
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4687064"><i>Connecting Chinese
and American Scam Victims</i></a>, a collaboration betwween Jonathan
Reiter’s company ChainArgos and BitTrace, a Chinese blockchain tracing
company. The abstract reads:
<blockquote>
The world is experiencing an epidemic of online scams with at least tens
of billions of dollars lost across dozens of countries. One particular
class of scam known as “pig butchering” has grown dramatically and often
involves the use of cryptocurrency both to collect funds from victims
and to launder the proceeds. Here we are going to explore the use of
cryptocurrency in pig butchering scams beginning with victims in both
the People’s Republic of China and United States of America, and
demonstrating the remarkable degree of similarity for cases that have no
reason <i>a priori</i> to be similar at all.<br /> <br /> Specifically
we will show that scammers with victims in both these countries share
cryptocur- rency addresses, use overlapping sets of money-laundering
services, and are therefore likely parts of the same group or syndicate.
Our analysis begins with reports from victims in both countries where we
find source victim and scam wallet addresses. From there we are able to
trace scam proceeds through the cryptocurrency ecosystem to prove these
connections. Finally, a range of exchanges and other service providers
are identified through a combination of on-chain and documentary
research, to demonstrate the cross-border nature of modern scams
leveraging cryptocurrencies, and highlight the challenges facing law
enforcement agencies globally when it comes to such scams.
</blockquote>
The two teams use press accounts of two cases with victims in China and
legal filings from two cases with victims in Florida and California.
They provide detailed traces, including wallet addresses, of flows from
the victims to exchanges including Binance, Bitkub, FTX, OKX, Coinbase,
Huboi, Maskex, Paribu and Peatio amounting to $635M. In particular, one
of the Binance wallets was one of those identified in Reuters’
reporting. The paper
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4687064">concludes</a>:
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
Similar simultaneously-run scams have victims in both China and the
United States.
</li>
<li>
Funds taken from both jurisdictions flow through common service
providers.
</li>
<li>
The sums involved range from the tens to possibly hundreds of millions
of dollars.
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
The ChainArgos team followed up with
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/laundering-the-proceeds-of-crime-cryptos-killer-app-02686113ff66"><i>Laundering
the Proceeds of Crime: Crypto’s Killer App?</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Now we are going to connect a few more dots to argue that scamming and
the laundering of scam proceeds was not just a use case for
cryptocurrencies in Asia, but likely a major driver of flows through
several well-known industry players.<br /> <br /> This may well even be,
empirically, crypto’s killer app.
</blockquote>
They note that
<a href="https://protos.com/genesis-block-ftx-had-more-than-prostitutes-in-thailand/">Genesis
Block</a>, whose
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKeMfxLV8K8">Charles Yang
admitted</a> maintaining bank accounts in South-East Asia under false
pretences, appears to have been the
<a href="https://www.dirtybubblemedia.com/p/blockchain-evidence-suggests-genesis">on-
and off-ramp for FTX</a> in the region. The
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4687064">earlier paper</a>
showed
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/laundering-the-proceeds-of-crime-cryptos-killer-app-02686113ff66">that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
FTX was involved in processing over US$250 million in flows downstream
from scams and Bitkub, Thailand’s largest crypto exchange, was involved
in over US$100 million.
</blockquote>
Could this be
“<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/laundering-the-proceeds-of-crime-cryptos-killer-app-02686113ff66">banking
Cambodia’s unbanked</a>”?:<br />
<blockquote>
Cambodia’s population is only 16 million, with a per capita GDP of about
US$1,600 — it’s hard to imagine Cambodia driving hundreds of millions of
dollars worth of stablecoin flows.
</blockquote>
They refer to the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKeMfxLV8K8">interview with
Charles Yang</a> and
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/laundering-the-proceeds-of-crime-cryptos-killer-app-02686113ff66">note
that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Genesis Block’s head trader explicitly talks about scam proceeds leading
to bank account freezes and how they actively manage this problem.<br />
<br /> So Genesis Block were clearly a downstream service provider and
knew that at least some of their clients were, or at least were dealing
with, criminals.<br /> <br /> With regards to Genesis Block’s Chinese
client base, in a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l86eSpiUbKw">different
interview</a> the same person says:<br />
<blockquote>
<i> We’ve been seeing a lot of our partners pretty much disappear…a lot
of our friends over there are kind of in big trouble…it’s not really
about crypto it’s more about the source of the RMB… [which was] a lot of
pyramid schemes, a lot of scams. </i>
</blockquote>
Genesis Block were clearly dealing with people who were either criminals
themselves, or service providers to criminals, and Genesis Block
appeared comfortable talking about such activities on camera.
</blockquote>
Genesis Block was
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/laundering-the-proceeds-of-crime-cryptos-killer-app-02686113ff66">plugged
in to the top level of cryptocurrency infrastructure</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Genesis Block OTC was on the
<a href="https://www.dirtybubblemedia.com/p/a-walled-garden-full-of-snakes-the">Signet
client list</a>, as were many of the other exchanges referenced in our
earlier work.<br /> <br /> A service provider that talked openly about
dealing with criminals was active on a platform another commentator
described as
“<a href="https://www.dirtybubblemedia.com/p/a-walled-garden-full-of-snakes-the">a
walled garden filled with snakes</a>.”<br /> <br /> That service
provider (Genesis Block) was integrated with FTX/Alameda Research),
which was both the
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/usdt-on-tron-ftx-wtf-is-really-happening-ef0cb807019a">largest
recipient of new USDT</a> and a major exchange operator with
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/technology/sam-bankman-fried-fraud-trial-ftx.html">myriad,
sometimes-remarkably-creative, schemes to access fiat currency</a>.
</blockquote>
This leads ChainArgos to
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/laundering-the-proceeds-of-crime-cryptos-killer-app-02686113ff66">argue
that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
it is entirely plausible that:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Genesis Block’s client base included many of these scammers and/or
crimionals;
</li>
<li>
the outsized involvement of FTX was this flow; and/or
</li>
<li>
so was the Bitkub flow, via Genesis Block or otherwise;
</li>
</ul>
and this isn’t just plausible, it’s provable, because the illicit flows
documented in our prior work were laundered by someone.<br /> <br /> If
it wasn’t this route it means there is at least one more
multi-billion-dollar laundering pipeline connected to this activity we
know nothing about.<br /> <br /> That is possible of course, but seems
unlikely.<br /> <br /> Certainly the simplest explanation is that no
second as-yet-undiscovered group of scammers or criminals exists and
it’s all the same organization.<br /> <br /> Now remember these actors
specifically mentioned that the traditional financial system was
blocking them and freezing their accounts.
</blockquote>
Thus ChainArgos
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/laundering-the-proceeds-of-crime-cryptos-killer-app-02686113ff66">concludes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
We are looking at a gigantic amount of bad flow that was caught by banks
and how cryptocurrencies were used to circumvent those controls.<br />
<br /> The contents of those frozen accounts could have been, and at
least partially would have been, sent back to the victims instead of
being irreversibly exfiltrated.<br /> <br /> So this may well be
crypto’s real killer app — irreversible cross-border transfers for
criminals.
</blockquote>
Taken together, what these documents show is lives being wrecked, both
by the scams themselves leading to suicides, and by the human trafficing
that provides the scammers workforce, leading to beatings, imprisonment
and suicides. Pillars of the cryptocurrency community are enabling
this:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Tether, which refused to freeze wallets despite detailed blockchain
evidence of pig-butchering even from law enforcement. Contrast this with
Tether’s behavior in the case of
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/what-happens-when-tether-freezes-your-tether-5a8ece2bd508">The
Victim</a> documented by Patrick Tan, where a simple request from law
enforcement with only suspicion froze a wallet.
</li>
<li>
Major exchanges, including Binance, FTX, Huboi and many others, were on
notice that they were handling funds from the pig butchers. Take Binance
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/fintech-crypto-fraud-thailand/">for
example</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Binance publicly said it assisted Thai police with a probe into “a
significant pig butchering scam,” and that about $277 million of assets
were confiscated.
</blockquote>
and they
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/fintech-crypto-fraud-thailand/">blamed
the victims</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
the number of reports of pig-butchering scams it had received this year
was double that of 2022, an increase it attributed to an influx of
inexperienced crypto investors and scammers looking to exploit them.
</blockquote>
and they responded to a
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/fintech-crypto-fraud-thailand/">Dept.
of Justice warrant</a> about these funds.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus these businesses cannnot claim ignorance of the flow of
pig-butchering funds, or of their scale. But they are clearly motivated
to turn a blind eye to them whenever possible.<br /> <br /></p>

<p>Authorities say the CH-53E Super Stallion vanished late Tuesday night

training at Creech Air Force Base, northwest of Las Vegas.</p>
<p>“It is with a heavy heart and profound sadness that I share the loss

Tigers,” Maj. Gen. Michael J. Borgschulte, commander of 3rd Marine
Aircraft Wing, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The names of the Marines were not immediately released.</p>

Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S)</a>. New data shows that
from February 2023 through January 2024, the average global temperature
was 1.52 degrees Celsius higher than the 1850-1900 baseline. Last month
was also the warmest January ever recorded, C3S confirmed. In 2015, 196
nations adopted the legally binding Paris Agreement with the long-term
goal of limiting the global temperature increase to well below 2 degrees
Celsius, and ideally below 1.5 degrees. A one-year breach doesn’t mean
the target is bust, because it “refers to long-term warming – the IPCC
uses 20 to 30 years – not annual temperatures that include the
short-term influence of natural fluctuations in the climate, such as El
Niño,”

air pollution rules</a> yesterday, cracking down on dangerous
particulate matter. Previously, the EPA’s annual standard for
concentrations of particulate matter was 12 micrograms per cubic meter
(µg/m3). Based on epidemiological research showing that this standard
did not adequately protect public health, the agency has now lowered the
standard to 9 µg/m3. The rules are expected to prevent 4,500 premature
deaths per year by 2032. The EPA also updated its Air Quality Index in
conjunction with the new rules, which could mean that even as the air
gets cleaner, you might get more air quality alerts,

<li>Monarch butterfly numbers drop sharply
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Heat, drought, and pesticides and herbicides are taking
a toll on the monarch butterfly population. Numbers of the iconic orange
butterflies in Mexico, where they spend the winter, fell by 59% this
year to their second lowest level ever recorded, <em>The Associated
Press
</em><a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=5f40c1dc34&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.
Extreme weather, logging, and chemical treatments are all hurting the
insects’ natural habitat and killing the milkweed plant on which they
lay their eggs. “It has a lot to do with climate change,” said Gloria
Tavera, director of Mexico’s Commission for National Protected Areas.
The monarchs’ migration path is the longest of any insect species known
to science: They winter in Mexico and then head north to Canada. No
single butterfly survives the entire trek; instead their offspring
finish it for them, before turning around and heading back to Mexico to
start the process over again.

<strong></strong>Danish energy developer Orsted said yesterday that it
had lost a ton of money on its experiment trying to build wind farms in
the United States, and planned to take on way less risk going forward.
The figures are pretty grim, as
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=9f1ae36f9a&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Heatmap</em>’s
Matthew Zeitlin reported</a>: Orsted had 9.6 billion Danish kroner worth
of fees (about $1.4 billion) related to one New Jersey project, Ocean
Wind 1, and had booked $4 billion of losses, most of which were due to
Ocean Wind 1’s cancellation. Overall, it reported a loss of almost $3
billion in 2023. Orsted also said it was pulling out of Norway, Spain,
and Portugal. In a call with analysts, the company’s chief executive
Mads Nipper said that Orsted will spend far less money on projects
before making the final approval to go forward with construction.

<li>Study suggests thinking about future generations moves people to
support climate policy
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Convincing people to change their habits and beliefs is
very hard, but when it comes to the climate crisis, widespread
behavioral shifts are essential. A new “global megastudy” of more than
59,000 participants across 63 countries attempted to figure out which
“interventions” can be most effective at shifting beliefs and getting
people to support climate policy. The results,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=1394353292&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published
in <em>Science Advances</em></a>, show that the act of writing a letter
to future generations was “one of the top interventions tested.”
Participants had to pen a note to a hypothetical child who will be
turning 30 in the year 2055, detailing what they’re doing now to help
keep the planet healthy. This exercise was the most effective
intervention at nudging people toward supporting climate mitigation
policies.

<h2 id="on-software-liabilities">On Software Liabilities</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, updated: 2024-02-07, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Over on Lawfare, Jim Dempsey published a really interesting
<a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/standards-for-software-liability-focus-on-the-product-for-liability-focus-on-the-process-for-safe-harbor">proposal</a>
for software liability: “Standard for Software Liability: Focus on the
Product for Liability, Focus on the Process for Safe Harbor.”
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Section 1 of this paper sets the stage by briefly describing the problem
to be solved. Section 2 canvasses the different fields of law (warranty,
negligence, products liability, and certification) that could provide a
starting point for what would have to be legislative action establishing
a system of software liability. The conclusion is that all of these
fields would face the same question: How buggy is too buggy? Section 3
explains why existing software development frameworks do not provide a
sufficiently definitive basis for legal liability. They focus on
process, while a liability regime should begin with a focus on the
product—­that is, on outcomes. Expanding on the idea of building codes
for building code, Section 4 shows some examples of product-focused
standards from other fields. Section 5 notes that already there have
been definitive expressions of software defects that can be drawn
together to form the minimum legal standard of security. It specifically
calls out the list of common software weaknesses tracked by the MITRE
Corporation under a government contract. Section 6 considers how to
define flaws above the minimum floor and how to limit that liability
with a safe harbor…

<h2 id="los-angeles-is-probably-too-good-at-preventing-big-floods">Los
Angeles Is Probably Too Good at Preventing Big Floods</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
For the past few days, Southern Californians have found themselves
living with a kind of weather one doesn’t typically associate with the
region: rain. Days of rain. The kind of rain that, in the worst cases,
causes flooding and landslides, and in the best cases enforces a kind of
unwilling solitude. (A friend in the Los Angeles area recently sent me a
video of her German Shepherd, yowling discontentedly at the falling
water.) One gauge at the University of California, Los Angeles recorded
<a href="https://twitter.com/MatthewCappucci/status/1754756623816687989" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more
than a foot</a> of rain in 24 hours, making it what the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration calls a “thousand-year”
rainfall event.
</p>
<p>
The cause is a slow-moving atmospheric river that has essentially parked
itself over the region. And yet, even with all that rain, California
<a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2023/1/6/23542194/california-atmospheric-river-flood-drought" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">still
won’t</a> be able to escape the drought that’s gripped the West for
years. California, it turns out, might be a bit <em>too </em>good at
flood control.
</p>
<p>
Undeveloped floodplains act like natural speed bumps for fast-moving
floods — the water spreads out over the plain, slows down, and
eventually seeps into the dirt to become groundwater. But land is at a
premium in Southern California, especially in the L.A. area, and for
decades the prevailing wisdom was to contain rivers with concrete so
they wouldn’t flood, opening the floodplains to housing development.
What we still call the L.A. River is now, essentially, a concrete drain.
</p>
<p>
This creates two problems. First, there’s no natural barrier that can
slow down flood waters during events like this week’s storms. And
second, there’s nowhere for that water to go other than into the rivers
and out to sea.
</p>
<p>
“Most of the rivers in Southern California are channelized, or
concrete-lined, and most of the floodplains are developed,”
<a href="https://search.asu.edu/profile/4522298" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jay
Famiglietti</a>, a hydrologist at Arizona State University’s Global
Futures Lab and a former member of the California State Water Board in
Santa Ana and Los Angeles, told me. “When we built all that
infrastructure, we really were thinking more about flooding and not
thinking about saving that water.”
</p>
<p>
That’s because California has historically been pretty well-supplied
with water from the Colorado River and Sierra Nevada snowpack that would
melt in the spring and summer, delivering water through mountain
streams. But as Ian James wrote in the <em>Los Angeles Times </em>last
week, California is in
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-01-31/amid-storms-california-snowpack-remains-far-below-average" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
“snow drought,”</a> with about only about half the historical average
snowpack for this point in the season. While the storms might help shore
up the Sierra Nevada snowpack a bit, it still won’t be enough.
</p>
<p>
Warmer air carries more water, but it also means that less snow falls at
lower elevations than before — where once we might have seen a few
inches of snow, we now see a few inches of rain. During an atmospheric
river in particular, so much water is dumped over such a short time
period that protecting people from flooding becomes the primary concern.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a difficult balance between protecting people against flooding,
which I think we do a really good job at, and replenishing groundwater,”
Famiglietti said. But, he told me, Californians need to start having
some difficult conversations about the possibility of moving people off
the floodplains — what planners called “managed retreat” — and returning
riverbanks to their natural state so that floodwaters can spread out
into the plains, slow down, and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/so-how-do-you-actually-refill-an-aquifer" target="_self">refill
aquifers</a> that the state can rely on throughout the year.
</p>
<p>
Managed retreat is a difficult topic — nobody ever wants to leave their
home. And then there’s the problem of money; local, state, and federal
government agencies would probably have to fund all those moves and the
subsequent restoration of the rivers and floodplains. “We need to be
spending a lot more money,” Famiglietti told me. “We’re talking
trillions of dollars. And who pays for it, the federal government or the
state? I don’t have the answer.”
</p>
<p>
There <em>are</em> some plans to reshape the L.A. River,
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2021-01-11/frank-gehry-plan-los-angeles-river" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spearheaded
by none other than Frank Gehry</a> — but Famiglietti says that instead
of restoring the river’s banks and opening up floodplains, the plans
call for even more development. A coalition of environmental groups
opposes the plan, saying Gehry’s idea, which includes the construction
of “platform parks” that would span over the canal, saying that it
“stands to do particular ecological harm, create real estate
speculation, and precludes future opportunities for climate resilience.”
</p>
<p>
Going in the opposite direction — less development and less concrete —
is sort of antithetical to our ideas of progress. But the atmospheric
rivers will keep coming, Famiglietti stressed, and it’s difficult to
plan a city around unpredictable rain events.
</p>
<p>
“We did the right thing at the time [when we built flood
infrastructure],” Famiglietti told me. “But now, in a sense, we have to
be thinking about moving backwards.”

id="iraq-criticizes-us-strikes-after-baghdad-attack-killed-iran-backed-militant-group-commander">Iraq
Criticizes US Strikes After Baghdad Attack Killed Iran-Backed Militant
Group Commander</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Pentagon — Iraq Thursday sharply criticized a U.S. drone strike that
the U.S. military said killed a leader of an Iranian-backed militant
group, with an Iraqi spokesman calling the attack “a blatant
assassination” that showed “no regard for civilian lives or
international laws.”</p>
<p>Yehia Rasool, a spokesman for the Iraqi prime minister, said the
U.S.-led coalition that has operated in Iraq to counter the Islamic
State group “consistently deviates from the reasons and objectives for
its presence on our territory.”</p>
<p>“The trajectory compels the Iraqi government more than ever to
terminate the mission of this coalition, which has become a factor for
instability and threatens to entangle Iraq in the cycle of conflict,”
Rasool said in a statement.</p>
<p>U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the
Middle East, said the strike on Tuesday killed a commander of the
militant group Kataib Hezbollah who was “responsible for directly
planning and participating in attacks on U.S. forces in the region.”</p>
<p>Two U.S. officials confirmed to VOA that the commander was operations
officer Wisam Mohammad al-Saedi. Photos on social media allegedly showed
his Iraqi identification card that was pulled from his body.</p>
<p>VOA had earlier reported the U.S. military was involved in an
airstrike against a high-value target in the Middle East but had not
identified al-Saedi by name.</p>
<p>Video shared on social media shows a vehicle engulfed in flames on a
Baghdad highway.</p>
<p>The U.S. strike was in response to the almost 170 drone, rocket and
missile attacks against U.S. forces in the Middle East since
mid-October, one of which killed three U.S. service members and wounded
dozens more in northern Jordan last week.</p>
<p>A wave of U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and Syria on Friday pounded targets
associated with Iranian-backed militias responsible for the attacks. The
strikes targeted three locations in Iraq, as well as another four in
Syria, and they destroyed more than 80 individual targets, ranging from
command-and-control centers and intelligence hubs to missile and drone
storage facilities, according to the latest U.S. assessments.</p>
<p>But while U.S. officials have defended the strikes as necessary
following a drone attack that killed three U.S. soldiers at a base in
Jordan last month, Iraqi officials have voiced increased anger,
summoning the U.S. chargé d’affaires in Baghdad to protest. They have
charged that some of the U.S. strikes hit elements of Iraq’s own
security forces.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department said Monday that Iraq was not given any
warning but added the U.S. strikes should not have come as a
surprise.</p>
<p>Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder said Monday the U.S.
had no plans for a long-term military campaign against the militias in
Iraq and Syria, but he noted the U.S. response to the killing of its
service members was “not complete.”</p>
<p>The U.S. has about 2,500 troops in Iraq tasked with advising and
assisting Iraqi security forces as they pursue the remnants of the
Islamic State terror group, also known as ISIS or Daesh.</p>
<p>And while talks between the U.S. and Iraq are under way to eventually
reduce the U.S. military footprint and transition from the counter-IS
mission to what officials describe as more traditional
military-to-military relationship with Baghdad, the process has been
complicated by the attacks.</p>
<p>The United States has also been carrying out strikes in response to
attacks by Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen who have threatened key
Red Sea shipping lanes.</p>
<p>U.S. Central Command, which overseas U.S. forces in the region, said
Thursday it conducted two separate strikes late Wednesday against Houthi

Heads Home Without Israeli-Hamas Cease-Fire or Hostage Release</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>State Department  — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken returned
to Washington from the Middle East on Thursday with no new deal in hand
for a cease-fire in the four-month Israel-Hamas war in Gaza or release
of any more hostages held by the militants.</p>
<p>Blinken and other U.S. officials said they remained optimistic a halt
in the fighting can be achieved and 100 or so remaining hostages freed.
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu derided a Hamas plan that
would leave the militants in control of the Gaza Strip as “delusional”
and said Israeli forces would fight to win “absolute victory.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the White House announced that President Joe Biden would
host Jordan’s King Abdullah II in Washington on Monday for talks on
resolving the Israel-Hamas conflict.</p>
<p>Blinken wrapped up a four-nation Mideast trip by meeting with
Netanyahu’s war cabinet, including former military chiefs Benny Gantz
and Gabi Eisenkot. The top U.S. diplomat said he would focus on “the
hostages and the strong desire that we both have to see them returned to
their families, the work that’s being done to that end.”</p>
<p>But late Wednesday, Blinken acknowledged sharp differences between a
cease-fire plan offered by Israel, the U.S., Qatar and Egypt that would
last several weeks and free hostages and Hamas’ response calling for an
Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza, an end to its bombardment of Gaza
and the right for Hamas to govern the territory and rebuild its military
capability.</p>
<p>“Clearly there are things that Hamas sent back that are absolute
non-starters,” Blinken said at a news conference. “But, at the same
time, we see space to continue to pursue an agreement.”</p>
<p>“And these things are always negotiations,” he said. “It’s not
flipping a light switch. It’s not ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ There’s invariably back
and forth.”</p>
<p>A senior Hamas official said a Hamas delegation was in Cairo on
Thursday to continue negotiations with Egyptian and Qatari
officials. </p>
<p>The United States has been Israel’s staunchest ally in its fight
against Hamas following the militants’ shock October 7 attack on Israel
that killed 1,200 people. But Netanyahu was dismissive of Blinken’s
assessment that the Hamas’ plan could at least serve as a starting point
for cease-fire discussions.</p>
<p>“We are on the way to an absolute victory. There is no other
solution,” Netanyahu said at a news conference after meeting with
Blinken. He said Israel’s war effort would take months, not years. </p>
<p>The Israeli leader also appeared to dismiss concerns from the U.S.
and others about expanding Israel’s military operations in southern
Gaza, particularly in Rafah on the Egyptian border, where more than a
million Palestinians have fled at Israel’s demand to escape fighting
further to the north.</p>
<p>Blinken said, “On all of my previous visits here and pretty much
every day in between, we have pressed Israel in concrete ways to
strengthen civilian protection, to get more assistance to those who need
it. And over the past four months, Israel has taken important steps to
do just that,” he said. “And yet … the daily toll that its military
operations continue to take on innocent civilians remains too high.”</p>
<p>In rejecting the Hamas cease-fire plan, Netanyahu also called for the
dismantlement of the United Nations relief agency for Palestinians, the
main distributor of international humanitarian assistance in Gaza, after
allegations that a dozen of its employees took part in the Hamas October
attack. </p>
<p>Blinken appealed to Netanyahu and other Israelis not to let vengeance
dictate their continued response.</p>
<p>“Israelis were dehumanized in the most horrific way on October 7,” he
said. “And the hostages have been dehumanized every day since. But that
cannot be a license to dehumanize others.”  </p>
<p>The Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry says Israel’s
counter-offensive has killed more than 27,500 people and displaced about
2 million Palestinians in Gaza from their homes. </p>
<p>In its proposal, Hamas called for three 45-day phases, first
releasing all remaining women and children, as well as older and sick
men, in exchange for an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners held
by Israel. </p>
<p>The Hamas plan calls for Israel to withdraw from populated areas and
end its aerial bombardment while also allowing far more humanitarian aid
to enter Gaza and permitting Palestinians to return to their homes,
including in devastated northern Gaza. </p>
<p>The second phase, to be negotiated during the first, would include
the release of all remaining hostages, mostly soldiers, in exchange for
all Palestinian detainees over the age of 50, including senior
militants, to be freed by Israel.</p>
<p>Israel would release an additional 1,500 prisoners, 500 of whom would
be specified by Hamas, and complete its withdrawal from Gaza. </p>
<p>In the third phase, the sides would exchange the remains of hostages
and prisoners. Israel says it believes more than two dozen of the
remaining 130 or so hostages in Gaza have already died or been
killed. </p>
<p>Blinken’s trip to the Mideast was his fifth since the war
started.</p>
<p>He has reiterated the U.S, stance that creation of a Palestinian
state is the best way to ensure lasting peace and security for Israelis
and Palestinians alike, and greater integration for the region.
According to the State Department, Blinken also emphasized the urgent
need to lower tensions in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and prevent the
conflict from expanding. </p>
<p>Critics have attacked Netanyahu for having no definitive plan for
governing Gaza after the war ends. </p>
<p>He said Wednesday, “The day after is the day after Hamas. All of
Hamas.”</p>
<p>Netanyahu has rejected any arrangement that would leave Hamas in full
or partial control of Gaza. He also said Israel is the “only power”
capable of guaranteeing security in the long term.</p>

<h2 id="china-linked-hackers-lurk-in-critical-us-systems">China-Linked
Hackers Lurk in Critical US Systems</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — China-linked hackers targeting key sectors of the U.S.
economy appear to have been hiding in key computer systems and networks
for at least five years, according to a new warning from the United
States and key allies, who urge companies to take urgent action to
mitigate the risk. </p>
<p>The cybersecurity advisory issued Wednesday by multiple U.S.
agencies, including the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency (CISA), states that a cyberthreat group known as Volt
Typhoon has been “positioning itself to launch destructive cyberattacks
that would jeopardize the physical safety of Americans.” </p>
<p>In particular, the advisory warns that China-linked Volt Typhoon
hackers have successfully infiltrated the computer networks of private
companies linked to critical sectors of the U.S. economy, including
communications, energy, water and wastewater, and transportation. </p>
<p>The advisory further warns that Volt Typhoon hackers have been
“maintaining access and footholds within some victim IT environments for
at least five years.” And CISA acknowledged the penetrations may be more
extensive than is currently known. </p>
<p>Officials said other industries, including construction, information
technology and education are also being targeted. </p>
<p>“What we’ve found to date is likely the tip of the iceberg,” CISA
Director Jen Easterly said in a statement. “CISA teams have found and
eradicated Volt Typhoon intrusions into critical infrastructure across
multiple sectors.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to the FBI and CISA, the advisory — and its findings —
were endorsed by the U.S. National Security Agency, as well as cyber
officials from Canada, Australia and New Zealand, who said that their
own critical infrastructure could also be at risk. </p>
<p>One CISA official called the advisory “a stark warning to critical
infrastructure organizations.” </p>
<p>“The information that we are releasing with this advisory is
reflecting a strategic shift in PRC [People’s Republic of China]
malicious cyber activity from a focus on espionage and IT theft,” said
Eric Goldstein, CISA executive assistant director for
cybersecurity. </p>
<p>“Our evidence strongly suggests that these PRC actors are positioning
to launch future disruptive or destructive cyberattacks that could cause
impact to national security, economic security or public health and
safety,” he told reporters, adding he expects the number of victims to
grow. </p>
<p>Goldstein and other U.S. officials said that so far, there are no
indications that hackers with Volt Typhoon have attempted to launch any
sort of disruptive attacks on critical infrastructure. But they also
said the way the Chinese-linked cyber actors infiltrated critical
networks means it is likely just a matter of time. </p>
<p>“This stealthy access increases our concern that they are lurking,
waiting for the right moment to cause devastating impacts,” said FBI
Deputy Assistant Director Cynthia Kaiser.  </p>
<p>Kaiser also warned that Volt Typhoon “is certainly not the only
Chinese group conducting this type of activity.” </p>
<p>She said the FBI has identified additional threats by using
surveillance capabilities authorized under Section 702 of the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, a controversial law that allows
the FBI and U.S. intelligence agencies to gather electronic data of
non-Americans without first obtaining a warrant.</p>
<p>“In fact, we only know about many critical infrastructure entities
compromised by the Chinese because of FBI FISA 702 collection,” she
said.</p>
<p>The latest warning comes just a week after top U.S. law enforcement
and cyber officials told lawmakers that they are bracing for a “cyber
onslaught” from China. </p>
<p>“The risk that poses to every American requires our attention — now,”
FBI Director Christopher Wray told the Select Committee on the Chinese
Communist Party last Wednesday. “China’s hackers are positioning on
American infrastructure in preparation to wreak havoc and cause
real-world harm to American citizens and communities, if or when China
decides the time has come to strike.” </p>
<p>China has repeatedly denied such allegations. </p>
<p>“The Chinese government has been categorical in opposing hacking
attacks and the abuse of information technology,” Liu Pengyu,
spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA via email
after last week’s hearing. “We urge the U.S. side to stop making
irresponsible criticism against other countries on the issue of
cyber-security.”</p>
<p>But officials in Washington have been steadfast in their warnings,
saying they believe Beijing would have few reservations about carrying
out an attack on U.S. critical infrastructure in the event of a
conflict. </p>
<p>Specifically, they cite the possibility of such attacks in the event
China decides to invade Taiwan as a way to damage Washington’s ability
to provide military assistance. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The just-released U.S. cybersecurity advisory urges companies to fix
security vulnerabilities that could allow hackers, like those with Volt
Typhoon, to infiltrate and hide — a tactic known as “living off the
land.” </p>
<p>It also encourages companies to search their systems in case hackers
have already broken through. </p>
<p>But officials admit there are significant challenges, pointing to a
just-disrupted Volt Typhoon malware campaign, which targeted common
computer routers used by homes and small businesses across the United
States to access critical infrastructure. </p>
<p>“These devices were no longer patched by the manufacturers, making
them vulnerable,” said the FBI’s Kaiser. “That’s why the FBI recommends
that network owners remove and replace any end-of-life devices to
minimize the risk of the device being compromised again by Volt Typhoon
or other malicious cyber actors.”</p>

id="stars-athletes-plan-to-flock-las-vegas-for-super-bowl-events">Stars,
Athletes Plan to Flock Las Vegas for Super Bowl Events</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Las Vegas will be flooded with so many pre- Super Bowl
events that Shaquille O’Neal lowered the prices to his popular
carnival-themed “Shaq’s Fun House.”</p>
<p>Instead of raising the rate, O’Neal decided to offer potential
attendees more bang for their buck to the NBA legend’s sixth annual
event planned for Friday in Sin City. He made the decision to lower the
rates after purchasing an expensive suite at the Formula One that cost
nearly five times more than normal to watch the racing event in Las
Vegas last year.</p>
<p>“We’re not going to do that to the people,” said O’Neal, who said the
going rate for Fun House starts at $99 but will increase as the event
nears. He’ll bring back Lil Wayne, Diplo and himself under his name DJ
Diesel to perform during his over-the-top festival — which features
several attractions including a Ferris wheel, circus performers and
premium bar.</p>
<p>“We could’ve done $200, $250 or $300,” said O’Neal whose event will
take place XS Nightclub at the Wynn — a hotel that will host Rob
Gronkowski ’s Gronk Beach in Encore on Saturday afternoon and Sports
Illustrated’s The Party in XS Nightclub later that night. “But I don’t
like taking advantage of people. We want to have the best party with the
best rides, performers and just hanging out.”</p>
<p>Along with O’Neal’s event, the days leading up to the Super Bowl
between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers will include
concerts from some of the biggest stars including Travis Scott, Green
Day, Killer Mike, Kelly Clarkson, Ice Spice, Future and David Guetta.
The week will include some comedy too.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at some of the invite-only and public events during a
busy Super Bowl week:</p>
<p>Fanatics Party</p>
<p>Michael Rubin is known for his exclusive summer bashes in the
Hamptons — which bring out stars like Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Leonardo DiCaprio,
Jennifer Lopez, Ben Affleck and Kendall Jenner.</p>
<p>Now, Rubin, the founder and CEO of Fanatics, will host his
invite-only daytime event at Marquee Dayclub at the Cosmopolitan the day
before the Super Bowl. His event will feature performances by Travis
Scott, The Chainsmokers, Ice Spice, A$AP Ferg, Meek Mill, Lil Baby,
Fabolous, Ludacris, Ne-Yo and Kid Laroi.</p>
<p>Madden Bowl</p>
<p>After Killer Mike collected three Grammys during his arrest-shortened
night, the Atlanta-based rapper is expected to be one of the performers
at the EA Sports’ The Madden Bowl.</p>
<p>Rock group Green Day will headline the Friday night event at House of
Blues. It will also feature Big Boi of OutKast and Breland.</p>
<p>“Las Vegas isn’t ready for the show we’re about to bring,” Big Boi
said.</p>
<p>In addition to the music performances, the event will include the
Madden NFL 24 Championship Series in front of a live audience — where
two of the world’s best players will travel to Las Vegas for their share
of the $1 million prize pool and title of Ultimate Madden Bowl
champion.</p>
<p>Kevin Hart and O’Neal’s production companies will hold a
star-studded, stand-up comedy showcase.</p>
<p>Actor Deon Cole will host the two-night show called the All Star
Comedy Jam with performances by D.L. Hughley, Earthquake, Desi Banks and
Aida Rodriguez. The event will be held inside the Resorts World Theatre’
5,000-capacity venue on Friday and Saturday night.</p>
<p>Gospel Celebration</p>
<p>Cedric the Entertainer and Tichina Arnold will help bring the gospel
to Sin City.</p>
<p>The stars of the CBS show The Neighborhood will host the Super Bowl
Soulful Celebration at the Palms Casino Resort on Wednesday night. The
lineup includes some of gospel’s best from Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Mary
Mary, Kirk Franklin, Robin Thicke and the NFL Players Choir including
Tully Banta-Cain and Bryan Scott, who played in the league.</p>
<p>“I want people to feel empowered walking away from this show,” Arnold
said. “You should never walk way feeling drained. You should walk way
feeling loved.”</p>
<p>CBS Mornings co-host Nate Burleson, a former NFL player, will receive
the Lifetime of Inspiration award. He will be the sixth person to
receive the honor the show’s 25-year history.</p>
<p>Previous recipients include Tony Dungy, Ray Lewis, Tim Brown, Troy
Vincent and Deion Sanders.</p>
<p>Gronk Beach</p>
<p>Despite being retired, Rob Gronkowski keeps making his presence felt
during the NFL’s championship week. </p>
<p>The four-time Super Bowl winner — who views himself the “MVP of Fun”
— will host a music festival called “Gronk Beach” the day before the big
game. The beach-themed party will feature a performance by DJ
Afrojack.</p>
<p>“It’s all about going there and having a good time. Just losing your
mind in a great and positive way,” Gronkowski said. “You can dance free,
be yourself freely and just enjoy yourself with great company around
you.”</p>
<p>Gronkowski placed his tickets starting at $74.</p>
<p>Billy Idol</p>
<p>Instead of riding his motorcycle on Super Bowl Sunday, Billy Idol
will be strolling on stage a few hours before kick off to perform during
a pre-game concert.</p>
<p>The legendary British rocker will perform Sunday just outside
Allegiant Stadium, where the NFL’s two best teams face off. He’s
expected to perform a 35-minute set on two different stages at On
Location’s Club 67 and Touchdown Club in front of nearly 9,000
guests.</p>
<p>Idol said he’s stoked about the setup being arranged by One Location
— a premium hospitality provider of the NFL. The hospitality company
offers various packages including Idol’s performance, attendance at NFL
Honors and postgame field access.</p>
<p>Maluma &amp; SiriusXM</p>
<p>Colombian superstar Maluma will take his vibrant Latin music vibes
into Las Vegas with the help of SiriusXM.</p>
<p>Maluma will headline a special concert at The Theater at Virgin
Hotels on Thursday night for SiriusXM subscribers and Pandora listeners.
He’s expected to perform songs from his latest album Don Juan including
Según Quién and COCO LOCO along with other fan favorites such as
Hawái.</p>
<p>Future and David Guetta are expected to perform at the invite-only
h.wood Homecoming Weekend pop up bash on Friday followed by another show
with Jack Harlow and Kaytranada performer the next night at a custom
venue on the Las Vegas Strip across from the Wynn.</p>
<p>On Saturday night, Zach Bryan will headline the Bud Light Backyard
Tour.</p>
<p>Tiësto will headline a show at LIV at Fontainebleau on Saturday while
21 Savage and 50 Cent are expected to perform the same night.</p>
<p>Lil Wayne will hit the stage once again but this time with T-Pain as
a co-headliner at the Alex Morgan and Dan Marino-hosted Michelob ULTRA
Country Club at Topgolf on Saturday night. Bryan and Leon Bridges will
perform at The Chelsea in The Cosmopolitan on Friday.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Guy Fieri will host his Guy’s Flavortown Tailgate, a free
and family-friendly event that he expects will draw more than 10,000.
Diplo will perform.</p>
<p>GQ will hold Super Bowl party Friday at the The Nomad Library and
sports agent Leigh Steinberg will host an event Saturday morning at
Ahern Luxury Boutique Hotel.</p>

Man Arrested in California for Theft of Trade Secrets</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A Chinese-born U.S. researcher has been arrested on
charges of stealing trade secrets, including technology used to detect
nuclear missile launches, the Justice Department said Wednesday. </p>
<p>Chenguang Gong, 57, of San Jose, California, was arrested on Tuesday,
the department said in a statement.</p>
<p>Gong, who became a US citizen in 2011, is accused of transferring
more than 3,600 files from the research and development company where he
briefly worked to personal storage devices.</p>
<p>The company was not identified.</p>
<p>According to court documents, the files included blueprints for
infrared sensors used in space-based systems to detect nuclear missile
launches and track ballistic and hypersonic missiles.</p>
<p>The files also allegedly included blueprints for sensors designed to
enable U.S. military aircraft to detect heat-seeking missiles and take
countermeasures.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said Gong “had previously sought to
provide the People’s Republic of China with information to aid its
military.”</p>
<p>“We know that foreign actors, including the PRC, are actively seeking
to steal our technology, but we will remain vigilant against this threat
by safeguarding the innovations of American businesses and researchers,”
Estrada said.</p>
<p>According to court documents, Gong worked at the unidentified company
from January 2023 to April 2023 as a circuit design manager for infrared
sensors.</p>
<p>The Justice Department said meanwhile that two Iranians have been
charged in another case involving sensitive technology.</p>
<p>Abolfazi Bazzazi, 79, and his son Mohammad Resa Bazzazi, 43, were
indicted in New York on charges of violating export laws by conspiring
between 2008 and 2019 to export equipment used in the aerospace industry
to Iran.</p>
<p>“The Bazzazis devised an intricate scheme to evade US export laws in
obtaining U.S. equipment and technology to be exported to Iran and for
the Government of Iran,” U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said.</p>
<p>“The defendants allegedly attempted to obtain commercial and military
aircraft items from multiple U.S. companies that supply the military,
aerospace and firefighting industries,” Peace said.</p>
<p>The Bazzazis reside in Iran and remain at large.</p>

Overtakes China as Leading Source of Goods Imported to US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — For the first time in more than two decades, Mexico last
year surpassed China as the leading source of goods imported to the
United States. The shift reflects the growing tensions between
Washington and Beijing as well as U.S. efforts to import from countries
that are friendlier and closer to home.</p>
<p>Figures released Wednesday by the U.S. Commerce Department show that
the value of goods imported to the United States from Mexico rose nearly
5% from 2022 to 2023, to more than $475 billion. At the same time, the
value of Chinese imports imports tumbled 20% to $427 billion.</p>
<p>The last time that Mexican goods imported to the United States
exceeded the value of China’s imports was in 2002.</p>
<p>Economic relations between the United States and China have severely
deteriorated in recent years as Beijing has fought aggressively on trade
and made ominous military gestures in the Far East.</p>
<p>The Trump administration began imposing tariffs on Chinese imports in
2018, arguing that Beijing’s trade practices violated global trade
rules. President Joe Biden retained those tariffs after taking office in
2021, making clear that antagonism toward China would be a rare area of
common ground for Democrats and Republicans.</p>
<p>As an alternative to offshoring production to China, which U.S.
corporations had long engaged in, the Biden administration has urged
companies to seek suppliers in allied countries (“friend-shoring’‘) or
to return manufacturing to the United States (“reshoring’‘).
Supply-chain disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic also led U.S.
companies to seek supplies closer to the United States
(“near-shoring’’).</p>
<p>Mexico has been among the beneficiaries of the growing shift away
from reliance on Chinese factories. But the picture is more complicated
than it might seem. Some Chinese manufacturers have established
factories in Mexico to exploit the benefits of the 3-year-old
U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement, which allows for duty-free trade in
North America for many products.</p>
<p>Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said this week that the
trade status gives Mexico new leverage, saying it would make it hard for
the U.S. to close the two countries’ border to limit immigration, as
suggested in negotiations on a border bill in the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>“The negotiation is proposing closing the border,” he said. “Do you
think Americans, or Mexicans, but especially the Americans, would
approve that? The businesses wouldn’t take it, maybe one day, but not a
week.”</p>
<p>Some industries — especially auto manufacturers — have set up plants
on both sides of the border that depend on each for a steady supply of
parts.</p>
<p>Derek Scissors, a China specialist at the conservative American
Enterprise Institute, noted that the biggest drops in Chinese imports
were in computers and electronics and chemicals and pharmaceuticals —
all politically sensitive categories.</p>
<p>“I don’t see the U.S. being comfortable with a rebound in those areas
in 2024 and 2025,” Scissors said, predicting that the China-Mexico
reversal on imports to the United States likely “is not a one-year
blip.’’</p>
<p>Scissors suggested that the drop in U.S. reliance on Chinese goods
partly reflects wariness of Beijing’s economic policies under President
Xi Jinping. Xi’s draconian COVID-19 lockdowns brought significant swaths
of the Chinese economy to a standstill in 2022, and his officials have
raided foreign companies in apparent counterespionage
investigations.</p>
<p>“I think it’s corporate America belatedly deciding Xi Jinping is
unreliable,” he said.</p>
<p>Overall, the U.S. deficit in the trade of goods with the rest of the
world — the gap between the value of what the United States sells and
what it buys abroad — narrowed 10% last year to $1.06 trillion.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-the-1-mb-barrier-in-dos">Beyond the 1 MB barrier in
DOS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Last month, we covered Julio Merino’s article about going from 0 to 1
MB in DOS, and now they’re back for breaking beyond that 1 MB barrier. I
know I promised that this follow-up article would be about DJGPP, but
before getting into that review, I realized I had to take another detour
to cover three more topics. Namely: unreal mode, which I intentionally
ignored to not derail the post; LOADALL, which I didn’t know about until
you readers mentioned it; and DOS extenders, which I was planning to
describe in the DJGPP article but they are a better fit for this one.
So… strap your seat belts on and dive right in for another tour through
the ancient techniques that DOS had to pull off to peek into the memory
address space above the first MB. And get your hands ready because we’ll
go over assembly code for a step-by-step jump into unreal mode. ↫ Julio
Merino What’s amazing is that I don’t even remember having to deal with
any of this while using MS-DOS back in the day. Games tended to use DOS
extenders automatically (DOS/4G!), but I don’t remember if I ever had to
set up any of the DOS above-640k stuff manually.</p>

<h2
id="special-counsel-completes-biden-classified-documents-investigation">Special
Counsel Completes Biden Classified Documents Investigation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The Justice Department special counsel investigating
President Joe Biden’s handling of classified documents has completed his
inquiry and is expected to make a report soon to Congress and the
public, Attorney General Merrick Garland told lawmakers in a letter
Wednesday. </p>
<p>Garland did not detail the conclusions of the report from special
counsel Robert Hur, but said he was committed to disclosing as much of
the document as possible once the White House completes a review for
potential executive privilege concerns. That process is expected to be
completed by the end of the week, said Ian Sams, a spokesman for the
White House counsel’s office. </p>
<p>The yearlong investigation centered on the improper retention of
classified documents by Biden from his time as a U.S. senator and as
vice president. Sensitive records were found at his Delaware home and at
a private office that he used in between his service in the Obama
administration and becoming president. </p>
<p>The resolution of the investigation arrives in a pivotal year for the
president as he pursues reelection in a deeply polarized political time.
Though the probe’s outcome is expected to lift a legal cloud over Biden,
criticism of his handling of classified records could blunt his ability
to attack Donald Trump - his presumptive opponent in November - over a
pending indictment charging the former president with hoarding
top-secret files at his Mar-a-Lago estate and obstructing FBI efforts to
get them back. </p>
<p>Challenge likely</p>
<p>Trump and other Republicans are likely to challenge the legitimacy of
the investigation by noting that it was launched by the Biden Justice
Department. </p>
<p>But Garland sought to insulate the department from claims of bias and
conflicts of interest by last year appointing Hur, a former U.S.
attorney for Maryland during the Trump administration, to handle the
Biden investigation and by naming a different special counsel, Jack
Smith, to oversee investigations into Trump. </p>
<p>While the Trump investigation resulted in dozens of felony charges
against the ex-president last year, the outcome of the Biden probe is
expected to be different. Justice Department policy prohibits the
indictment of a sitting president and, unlike in the Trump
investigation, no evidence has emerged to suggest that Biden engaged in
comparable conduct or willfully held on to records he wasn’t supposed to
have. </p>
<p>Even so, the White House’s response to the discovery of classified
documents early last year was delayed and incomplete. </p>
<p>The White House did not disclose the Justice Department’s
investigation until January 2023, when it acknowledged the discovery two
months earlier of a “small number” of classified documents by Biden
lawyers as they closed an office at the Penn Biden Center, a think tank
affiliated with the Ivy League school. Biden has said he was surprised
by the initial trove discovered by his lawyers. </p>
<p>The FBI subsequently conducted a 13-hour, top-to-bottom check of his
Wilmington, Delaware, home, where agents located documents with
classified markings from his time as a vice president and senator and
took possession of some of his handwritten notes. Biden’s personal
lawyers have also revealed that they had found a document bearing
classified markings while searching the Wilmington property but said
they had not found others during a separate inspection of his Rehoboth
Beach home. </p>
<p>The looming conclusion of the investigation had been foreshadowed
last fall when Biden sat for a voluntary interview at the White House
with Hur’s team. Interviews of key subjects in an investigation are
often done near the end. </p>
<p>Justice Department regulations require Congress to be notified of any
investigative steps or proposed actions by a special counsel that were
rejected by department leadership. There were no such actions, Garland
wrote.</p>

<h2 id="my-everything-everywhere-all-at-once-dream">My “Everything,
Everywhere, All at Once” Dream</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
A few months ago I had this funny dream, which has come back into my
mind a few times since and I figure I might as well share. Basically I
was back at high school, but Penny Wong was our dictatorial principal,
and I was in her office getting castigated for something stupid
(probably shooting my mouth off in class; that would’ve been very
in-character for me at that time). Anyway, she assigned me to some
cleaning detail in punishment for what I’d done, which is where I think
you can see the influence of
<a href="https://www.jayeless.net/wiki/my-novel.html">my novel</a>
coming in because that’s a pretty standard punishment in the world of
that
story.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
So, there I was, miserably scrubbing windows and removing cobwebs and
whatnot, when I looked into one of the buildings and saw
<em>another</em> detention going on, an in-classroom detention, and who
should I see in detention but VIVIAN, my now-partner, mucking around
with some mates. But it wasn’t Vivian as I know him now, it was Vivian
as I’ve seen him in photos of his high school days, packing a bit too
much weight and sporting a crazy afro. So I decided to sneak away from
<em>my</em> detention, and went up to him in class, where he turned to
me with a blank, confused look in his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t know me in this universe, do you?” I asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” he said. “Uh, I mean, that’s correct, I don’t know you.” (This is
<em>exactly</em> how he answers negative tag questions in real life;
it’s so annoying.)
</p>
<p>
“Well,” I said, “in another universe, you know me <em>very</em> well.”
</p>
<p>
And I walked away again, leaving it at that. As I did, he kind of went
back to mucking around with his mates, but it was with half an eye on me
as I went, wondering what could’ve been.
</p>
<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>
Actually, I had one detention in year 12 where I was supposed to do
this, as well. I say “supposed to” because I was so annoyed I even HAD
detention (basically I’d been like ten seconds late to school, and then
five minutes later there was a fire drill and everyone had to congregate
outside, so if I’d come FIVE MINUTES LATE instead of TEN SECONDS no one
would’ve known I was late and I wouldn’t have been given a detention. I
remember venting my frustration to my classmates that I was being
PUNISHED for TRYING to be on time, which they found hilarious.) that I
just flat-out refused to do it, and the teacher was so thrown (I was
mostly a good kid, just a smart ass) that she just went, “Okay then,”
and let me. So not quite the way my dream turned out,
then. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>

High Court Hears Arguments on Trump’s Eligibility to Regain
Presidency</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments Thursday
about whether likely Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is
ineligible for the office and must be excluded from states’ ballots
because of his role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S.
Capitol.</p>
<p>On that day, a mob of the former president’s supporters who believed
his rhetoric that the November 2020 election was stolen stormed the
Capitol to try to prevent lawmakers from certifying Joe Biden’s
victory.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a federal appeals court rejected Trump’s claim
that he has “absolute immunity” from prosecution on criminal charges in
a separate election interference case, United States of America v.
Trump.</p>
<p>That case was brought by special counsel Jack Smith in U.S. District
Court in Washington, resulting in four indictments in connection with
Trump’s widespread efforts to overturn the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Trump is likely to also appeal this case to the Supreme Court. He
maintains the various criminal and civil lawsuits brought against him
are part of Biden’s “witch hunt” to eliminate a political opponent — a
claim the White House and Democrats deny.</p>
<p>Trump v. Anderson</p>
<p>Trump v. Anderson, to be brought before the Supreme Court on
Thursday, addresses whether Trump must be barred from participating in
the Colorado primary election under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to
the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>The case began as Anderson v. Griswold, filed by Citizens for
Responsibility and Ethics in Washington on behalf of Norma Anderson, a
former Republican lawmaker in Colorado, with five other Republican and
independent voters, against Colorado Secretary of State Jena
Griswold.</p>
<p>Both cases look at whether Trump is an insurrectionist who tried to
stop the peaceful transfer of power and whether under Section 3 he
should be barred from holding office again.</p>
<p>Section 3 was written in 1866 after the end of the Civil War to keep
former Confederates — officials from the 11 Southern states that seceded
from the United States to protect the institution of slavery — from
returning to power.</p>
<p>It provides: “No person shall be a Senator or Representative in
Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any
office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State,
who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an
officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature,
or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the
Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or
rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies
thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove
such disability.”</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers argue that Section 3 does not apply to presidents,
that January 6 was not an insurrection, and that Trump was only
exercising his free-speech rights.</p>
<p>In November, a Colorado judge ruled that Trump engaged in
insurrection. But she ruled against blocking him from the state’s 2024
presidential primary ballot, finding that Section 3 did not apply to the
president. That part of her ruling was appealed and later reversed by
the Colorado Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Amicus briefs</p>
<p>Various scholars, election officials, lawmakers and other political
figures have filed amicus — “friend of the court” — briefs to share
their views in support of or against Trump.</p>
<p>One of them is Mark Graber, Regents professor at the University of
Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law and a leading expert in
constitutional law on insurrections and the 14th Amendment. His brief
argues that the Colorado Supreme Court’s ruling is consistent with how
the legal community understood insurrection at the time Section 3 was
framed, and that it correctly ruled an insurrection occurred.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump incited that insurrection,” Graber told VOA.</p>
<p>“He was told his tweets were inspiring violence against election
workers. He responded by intensifying his tweets. He was told there were
people in the crowd with weapons who intended to invade Congress. He
responded by saying, ‘When there’s fraud, you don’t use the usual means.
You fight — you fight like hell,’” he said. “A reasonable person could
say given Trump’s behavior, he intended to inspire an insurrection and
participate.”</p>
<p>In response to another central question in this case — whether the
14th Amendment applies to the president — Graber said the answer was
“obvious.”</p>
<p>“Every member of Congress who used the phrase ‘officer of the United
States’ in the 39th Congress said that the president was included,” he
underscored.</p>
<p>Others argue that enforcement of the 14th Amendment is for Congress
to determine, including Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, who filed
a brief with 26 other Republican attorneys general.</p>
<p>“Section 3 is not self-executing textually,” he said during a
Wednesday event hosted by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think
tank. He argued that under Section 5 that provides, “Congress shall have
power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this
article,” lawmakers should determine how the 14th Amendment is to be
enforced.</p>
<p>Alan Dershowitz, Felix Frankfurter professor of law at Harvard Law
School who defended Trump during his Senate impeachment trial, supports
this argument.</p>
<p>“In the absence of congressional action, I don’t believe the 14th
Amendment is self-enforcing,” he told VOA. “Otherwise, why would you
need Article 5 of the 14th Amendment that explicitly gives Congress the
power to make these decisions?”</p>
<p>A group of 25 leading historians, including Allan J. Lichtman,
distinguished professor of history at American University, argued in
their brief that Section 3 covers Trump and does not “require another
act of Congress or a conviction” of insurrection.</p>
<p>Lichtman told VOA it’s clear that Section 3 is designed to guard
against “not just ex-Confederates but future insurrectionists.”</p>
<p>“They wanted an amendment that would last in perpetuity and couldn’t
be tampered with by future congresses because it’s part of the
Constitution,” Lichtman said.</p>
<p>Legal questions aside, the American people should have the right to
choose their president, not judges, said Rokita. “Voters will lose all
confidence if judges decide that voters cannot even consider one of our
nation’s two leading presidential candidates,” he warned.</p>
<p>Far-reaching impact</p>
<p>Although the Supreme Court will only decide on the Colorado case, the
impact would be far-reaching, including for the state of Maine, whose
secretary of state ruled in December that Trump should be taken off the
state’s primary ballot, and pending cases in 11 other states that
challenge his electoral eligibility, as well as others in the
future.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court could uphold the Colorado ruling, which would be a
devastating blow to Trump’s reelection bid. Or it could rule that Trump
cannot be disqualified under Section 3 and put him back on the
ballot.</p>
<p>The justices could also decline to make a final decision and leave it
to lawmakers - for example, let Congress decide whether to certify
Trump’s victory should he win in November.</p>
<p>Six of the nine Supreme Court justices were appointed by Republican
presidents, including three by Trump. But since the question has almost
no legal precedent, it’s difficult to predict the justices’ individual
rulings based on their ideology.</p>
<p>It will be difficult for the justices to “contradict the historical
evidence,” said Lichtman. However, given the political magnitude, the
Supreme Court is likely to “take a technical off-ramp” and “punt on this
issue.”</p>
<p>Dershowitz agreed, predicting the justices would either “say the 14th
Amendment just doesn’t apply absent congressional action, or they will
figure out some way of putting off the ultimate issue.”</p>
<p>He underscored the importance of a unanimous decision by the Supreme
Court.</p>
<p>“A split decision would keep the country very divided,” he said.
“That means we’re likely to see a narrow decision that doesn’t decide
broad issues.”</p>
<p>It is unclear how long the Supreme Court will take to rule. In the
coming months, the high court also will likely deliberate on Trump’s
appeal of the election interference case prosecuted by Smith, which was
rejected Tuesday by a federal appeals court.</p>

id="journalists-criticize-tucker-carlson-over-putin-interview">Journalists
Criticize Tucker Carlson Over Putin Interview</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Former Fox News anchor Tucker Carlon’s announcement on
Tuesday that he interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin has been
met with disapproval from an array of journalists, some of whom say the
Kremlin may use the interview for propaganda purposes.</p>
<p>In a video posted on the social media platform X, Carlson said he
wanted to interview the longtime Russian leader because “Americans have
a right to know all they can about a war they are implicated in.”</p>
<p>In mid-March, Russia is set to hold presidential elections, which
Putin is all but guaranteed to win. Putin likely agreed to the interview
with Carlson because he thinks it will help his campaign, according to
Mikhail Rubin, deputy editor-in-chief of the Russian investigative
outlet Proekt Media.</p>
<p>Carlson “needs to understand that he’s a part of the presidential
election campaign, and he’s going to help [Putin], unfortunately,” Rubin
told VOA.</p>
<p>Rubin added that Carlson’s interview is likely to be used to paint
Moscow in a positive light.</p>
<p>“The most important is to show that Putin is open and that American
journalists can work inside Russia because Russia is an open and free
country,” Rubin said.</p>
<p>But that narrative is plainly false, said Rubin, who fled the country
in 2021 for safety reasons.</p>
<p>“If I go to Russia, as far as I understand, I will be arrested the
next day,” said Rubin, who is now based in Washington. “I’m not sure
that I will ever see my father again.”</p>
<p>Other Russian journalists shared similar critiques on social
media.</p>
<p>“I am like hundreds of Russian journalists who have had to go into
exile to keep reporting about the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine. The
alternative was to go to jail,” said Russian journalist Yevgenia Albats
on X. Meanwhile, Carlson was “shooting from the $1,000 Ritz suite in
Moscow,” she said.</p>
<p>Carlson also drew criticism for appearing to ignore the poor state of
press freedom in Russia, which has led to the arrests of scores of
reporters inside the country and forced many others into exile.</p>
<p>“Quite something to complain about how not enough American
journalists are reporting on the Russian side of Putin’s invasion of
Ukraine when two of them — Evan Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva — are in
jail right now for doing just that,” Max Seddon, Moscow bureau chief for
the Financial Times, said in a post on X.  </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal’s Gershkovich was arrested in March 2023 on
espionage charges that he, his employer and the U.S. government
vehemently deny.</p>
<p>Kurmasheva, an editor at VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio
Liberty, was jailed in October 2023 and is facing charges for failing to
register as a “foreign agent” and spreading false information about the
Russian military. She and her employer reject the charges.</p>
<p>Besides Kurmasheva and Gershkovich, at least 20 other journalists
were jailed in Russia as of the end of 2023, according to data from the
Committee to Protect Journalists.</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the interview was recorded on
Tuesday.</p>
<p>The interview will likely be published Thursday, according to the
Wall Street Journal. Carlson said it will be uploaded live and unedited
to X, where he launched a show after he was abruptly fired from the
conservative channel Fox News last year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The right-wing television personality hosted a prime-time show on Fox
News from 2016 until his firing in 2023. Carlson’s departure came
shortly after Fox News agreed to pay over $787 million to Dominion
Voting Systems to settle a defamation lawsuit over false election
claims, many of which Carlson himself propagated.</p>
<p>The Tucker Carlson Network did not immediately reply to VOA’s email
requesting comment.</p>
<p>After accusing U.S. media of “fawning pep session” interviews with
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Carlson went on to claim that
“not a single Western journalist has bothered to interview the president
of the other country in this conflict, Vladimir Putin.”</p>
<p>Journalists took to social media to criticize that claim, as
well.</p>
<p>“Does Tucker really think we journalists haven’t been trying to
interview President Putin every day since his full-scale invasion of
Ukraine?” CNN’s Christiane Amanpour said in a post on X. “It’s absurd —
we’ll continue to ask for an interview, just as we have for years
now.”</p>
<p>Even the Kremlin fact-checked that claim from Carlson.</p>
<p>“No, Mr. Carlson is wrong. In fact, he cannot know this,” Peskov, the
spokesperson, said, adding that the Kremlin receives many requests for
interviews with Putin.</p>

<h2 id="postgresql-16.2-15.6-14.11-13.14-and-12.18-released">PostgreSQL
16.2, 15.6, 14.11, 13.14, and 12.18 Released!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
The PostgreSQL Global Development Group has released an update to all
supported versions of PostgreSQL, including 16.2, 15.6, 14.11, 13.14,
and 12.18. This release fixes one security vulnerability and over 65
bugs reported over the last several months.
</p>
<p>
If you use GIN indexes, you may need to reindex after updating to this
release. Please see the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/">release notes</a> for
more information.
</p>
<p>
For the full list of changes, please review the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/">release notes</a>.

<h2>
Security Issues
</h2>
<h3>
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2024-0985/">CVE-2024-0985</a>:
PostgreSQL non-owner <code>REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY</code>
executes arbitrary SQL
</h3>
<p>
CVSS v3 Base Score:
<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H">8.0</a>
</p>
<p>
Supported, Vulnerable Versions: 12 - 15.
</p>
<p>
One step of a concurrent refresh command was run under weak security
restrictions. If a materialized view’s owner could persuade a superuser
or other high-privileged user to perform a concurrent refresh on that
view, the view’s owner could control code executed with the privileges
of the user running <code>REFRESH</code>. The fix for the vulnerability
makes is so that all user-determined code is run as the view’s owner, as
expected.
</p>
<p>
The PostgreSQL project thanks Pedro Gallegos for reporting this problem.

<h2>
Bug Fixes and Improvements
</h2>
<p>
This update fixes over 65 bugs that were reported in the last several
months. The issues listed below affect PostgreSQL 16. Some of these
issues may also affect other supported versions of PostgreSQL.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Fix memory leak when performing JIT inlining that could lead to
out-of-memory conditions.
</li>
<li>
Several query planner fixes.
</li>
<li>
Align <code>MERGE</code> behavior with <code>UPDATE</code> when updating
a partition key column and skip firing <code>AFTER UPDATE ROW</code>
trigger and other post-update actions.
</li>
<li>
Fix problems with duplicate token names in <code>ALTER TEXT SEARCH
CONFIGURATION … MAPPING</code> commands.
</li>
<li>
Fix <code>DROP ROLE</code> with duplicate role names.
</li>
<li>
Properly lock the associated table during DROP STATISTICS to prevent
errors if <code>ANALYZE</code> is running concurrently.
</li>
<li>
Fix function volatility checking for <code>GENERATED</code> and
<code>DEFAULT</code> expressions.
</li>
<li>
Ensure collation matches when matching an existing index to a new
partitioned index.
</li>
<li>
Avoid failure if a child index is dropped concurrently with
<code>REINDEX INDEX</code> on a partitioned index.
</li>
<li>
Fix for locking during cleanup of GIN indexes. For this case, if
multiple processes tried to clean the same GIN index page, there was a
chance of index corruption. If you believe you were affected by this
issue, reindex your GIN indexes after installing this update.
</li>
<li>
Avoid failure with partitioned SP-GiST indexes.
</li>
<li>
Several ownership fixes for large objects.
</li>
<li>
In <code>EXPLAIN (BUFFERS)</code>, change name of I/O timing data
“shared/local” to “shared”.
</li>
<li>
Ensure durability of the <code>CREATE DATABASE</code> command if a
system crash occurred during or shortly after execution.
</li>
<li>
Add more logging messages when starting and ending recovery from a
backup.
</li>
<li>
Revert a change that made the walreceiver process unresponsive to
<code>SIGTERM</code> while waiting for a replication connection to be
established.
</li>
<li>
Several fixes for logical replication.
</li>
<li>
Fix incompatibility with OpenSSL 3.2.
</li>
<li>
Fix PL/pgSQL to allow <code>CREATE FUNCTION</code>/<code>CREATE
PROCEDURE</code> SQL commands that use SQL-standard function bodies.
</li>
<li>
Fix for error handling in
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pipeline-mode.html">libpq
pipeline mode</a>.
</li>
<li>
Ensure <code>initdb</code> always uncomments
<code>postgresql.conf</code> entries for the <code>lc_</code> family of
parameters.
</li>
<li>
In <code>pg_dump</code>, don’t dump RLS policies or security labels for
extension member objects.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This release also updates time zone data files to tzdata release 2024a
for DST law changes in Greenland, Kazakhstan, and Palestine, plus
corrections for the Antarctic stations Casey and Vostok. Also historical
corrections for Vietnam, Toronto, and Miquelon.
</p>
<h2>
Updating
</h2>
<p>
All PostgreSQL update releases are cumulative. As with other minor
releases, users are not required to dump and reload their database or
use <code>pg_upgrade</code> in order to apply this update release; you
may simply shutdown PostgreSQL and update its binaries.
</p>
<p>
If you use GIN indexes, you may need to reindex after updating to this
release. Please see the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/">release notes</a> for
more information.
</p>
<p>
Users who have skipped one or more update releases may need to run
additional post-update steps; please see the release notes from earlier
versions for details.
</p>
