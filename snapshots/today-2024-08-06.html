<p>Buying and renovating a home in a different country is a decision
that would put any relationship to the test. But this Bay Area couple
snapped up a dilapidated house in a picturesque Italian town with the
hope of saving their marriage.</p>

<h2 id="its-not-partisanship-when-democracy-is-at-stake">It’s not
partisanship when democracy is at stake</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>
<img src="https://werd.io/file/66b23330c1a4638bb9020f12/thumb.jpg" alt="It's the stars and stripes, innit" width="1024" height="683">
</p>
<p>
This moment isn’t about partisanship, because the discussions we’re
having aren’t about tax policy or the intricacies of how we interact
overseas. In 2024, one candidate’s supporters are waving flags that read
“mass deportations now”, while the candidate is telling them they’ll
never need to vote in another election and calling for the termination
of parts of the Constitution. The other candidate, while we might
quibble about policy differences, is advocating for fairness and
inclusivity, and, you know, <em>continuing to have a democracy</em>.
</p>
<p>
So I don’t have any qualms about throwing myself in for Harris and Walz.
I would have voted for Biden and Harris, too, and probably also three
ferrets in a trenchcoat, as long as we were sure the ferrets didn’t
advocate for a white Christian nation. As it happens, I’m more aligned
with Harris and Walz than I have been with any Presidential candidate
maybe ever; certainly the last time I felt anything close to this
excitement was when Obama was running in the wake of eight disastrous
years under George W Bush. Even Obama was cautious on the campaign trail
and knocked back support for marriage equality, for example.
</p>
<p>
I’m particularly excited to see us move beyond the level of discourse
where we’re arguing about democracy vs not-democracy. Let’s get into the
intricacies of how we can help people without homes get back on their
feet, or to figure out how to help people buy their first houses; let’s
talk about literacy levels and how to move ourselves away from fossil
fuels without losing jobs and improving working conditions. A return to
a marketplace of genuine ideas rather than ideas vs unbridled id would
be an incredible step forward. I can’t <em>wait</em> to talk about tax
policy again.
</p>
<p>
And yeah, I’m looking forward to not thinking about That Guy, the folks
behind Project 2026, and their brand of nationalism for a good long
time. We need to move forward. We’re not going back.
</p>
<p>
The future could be much, much brighter than it has been for almost a
decade. Now we just have to win this thing.

id="wall-street-steadies-after-its-worst-day-in-nearly-2-years-and-stocks-are-mixed">Wall
Street steadies after its worst day in nearly 2 years, and stocks are
mixed</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Some calm is returning to Wall Street, and U.S. stocks are
holding steadier after Japan’s market soared earlier Tuesday to bounce
back from its worst loss since 1987.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 was 0.2% higher in early trading and on track to
break a brutal three-day losing streak. It had tumbled a bit more than
6% after several weaker-than-expected reports raised worries the Federal
Reserve had pressed the brakes too hard for too long on the U.S. economy
through high interest rates in order to beat inflation.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 47 points, or 0.1%, as of
9:43 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.3% lower.</p>
<p>Stronger-than-expected profit reports from several big U.S. companies
helped support the market. Kenvue, the company behind Tylenol and
Band-Aids, jumped 13.5% after reporting stronger profit than expected
thanks in part to higher prices for its products. Uber rolled 4.3%
higher after easily topping profit forecasts for the latest quarter.</p>
<p>Caterpillar veered from an early loss to a gain of 1.7% after
reporting stronger earnings than expected but weaker revenue.</p>
<p>Several technical factors may have accelerated the recent swoon for
markets, beyond the weak U.S. hiring data and other reports, in what
strategists at Barclays call “a perfect storm” for causing extreme
market moves. One is centered in Tokyo, where a favorite trade for hedge
funds and other investors began unraveling last week after the Bank of
Japan made borrowing more expensive by raising interest rates above
virtually zero.</p>
<p>That scrambled trades where investors had borrowed Japanese yen at
low cost and invested it elsewhere around the world. The resulting exits
from those trades may have helped accelerate the declines for markets
around the world.</p>
<p>But Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 10.2% Tuesday, following its 12.4%
sell-off the day before, which was its worst since the Black Monday
crash of 1987. Stocks in Tokyo rebounded as the value of the Japanese
yen stabilized a bit against the U.S. dollar following several days of
sharp gains.</p>
<p>“The speed, the magnitude and the shock factor clearly demonstrate”
how much of the moves were driven by how traders were positioned, rather
than just worries about the economy, according to the strategists at
Barclays led by Stefano Pascale and Anshul Gupta.</p>
<p>Still, some voices along Wall Street are continuing to urge
caution.</p>
<p>Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, is warning more
drops could be ahead because of a slowing U.S. economy and sticky
inflation. He had been predicting a coming “correction” in U.S. stock
prices for a while, including an acknowledgement in July that his
initial call was early. That was two days before the S&amp;P 500 set its
latest all-time high and then began sinking.</p>
<p>While fears are rising about a slowing U.S. economy, it is still
growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The U.S. stock market
is also still up a healthy amount for the year so far. The S&amp;P 500
has romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part due to a
frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology and critics have been
saying prices looked too expensive.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, European markets were mostly left out of the rebound, with
stock indexes down modestly in Germany France and the United
Kingdom.</p>

<h2 id="wordstar-for-dos-7.0-archive">WordStar for DOS 7.0 archive</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>As you all know, I continue to use WordStar for DOS 7.0 as my
word-processing program. It was last updated in December 1992, and the
company that made it has been defunct for decades; the program is
abandonware. There was no proper archive of WordStar for DOS 7.0
available online, so I decided to create one. I’ve put weeks of work
into this. Included are not only full installs of the program (as well
as images of the installation disks), but also plug-and-play solutions
for running WordStar for DOS 7.0 under Windows, and also complete
full-text-searchable PDF versions of all seven manuals that came with
WordStar — over a thousand pages of documentation. ↫ Robert J. Sawyer
WordStar for DOS is definitely a bit of a known entity in our circles
for still being used by a number of world-famous authors. WordStar 4.0
is still being used by George R. R. Martin – assuming he’s still even
working on The Winds of Winter – and there must be some sort of reason
as to why it’s still so oddly popular. Thanks to this work by author
Robert J. Sawyer, accessing and using version 7 of WordStar for DOS is
now easier than ever. One of the reasons Sawyer set out to do this was
making sure that if he passes away, the people responsible for his
estate and works will have an easy way to access his writings. It’s
refreshing to see an author think ahead this far, and it will surely
help a ton of other people too, since there’s quite a few documents
lingering around using the WordStar format.</p>

In the midst of recent market volatility, many investors are seeking
safe havens for their money. Cue the handy-dandy certificate of deposit,
which is currently giving guaranteed returns of 4% or 5% at many
financial institutions — but that may change when the Federal Reserve
cuts interest rates. Also: a look at Japan’s market rebound, cash prizes
that come with Olympic medals and the Justice Department’s antitrust

Tropical Storm Debby bringing torrential rains, major flood threat to
southeastern US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. — Tropical Storm Debby moved menacingly into
some of America’s most historic Southern cities and was expected to
bring prolonged downpours and flooding throughout the day Tuesday after
slamming into Florida and prompting the rescue of hundreds from flooded
homes.</p>
<p>Record-setting rain from the storm that killed at least five people
was causing flash flooding, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters)
possible in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said.</p>
<p>The storm’s center was over southeast Georgia early Tuesday with
maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (75 kph) and it was moving northeast
near 7 mph (11 kph). The center is expected to move off Georgia’s coast
later Tuesday. Some strengthening is forecast Wednesday and Thursday as
Debby drifts offshore, before it moves inland Thursday over South
Carolina.</p>
<p>“Hunker down,” Van Johnson, the mayor of Savannah, Georgia, told
residents in a social media livestream Monday night. “Expect that it
will be a rough day” on Tuesday, he said.</p>
<p>More than 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain had fallen through Monday
at Savannah’s airport, but more rain fell overnight and was continuing
Tuesday, the National Weather Service reported.</p>
<p>Flash flood warnings were issued in Savannah, Georgia, and
Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and
South Carolina. Both Savannah and Charleston announced curfews Monday
night into Tuesday.</p>
<p>In South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben
Webster called Debby a “historic and potentially unprecedented event”
three times in a 90-second briefing Monday.</p>
<p>In addition to the curfew, the city of Charleston’s emergency plan
includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents
can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that
shows which roads are closed due to flooding.</p>
<p>In Edisto Beach, South Carolina, a tornado touched down Monday night,
damaging trees, homes and taking down power lines, the Colleton County
Sheriff’s Office said on social media. No injuries were immediately
reported, officials said.</p>
<p>The weather service continued issuing tornado warnings well into
Monday night for parts of the state including Hilton Head Island.</p>
<p>At the edge of Hilton Head Island, musician Nick Poulin wasn’t overly
concerned about Debby since his equipment was inside and he made sure
that his car wasn’t parked under trees so it won’t be hit by falling
branches.</p>
<p>“I’m born and raised here, so we’ve had plenty of storms,” he said.
“It’s usually not as bad as people hype it up to be.”</p>
<p>Debby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a
Category 1 hurricane. It has weakened to a tropical storm and is moving
slowly, drenching and bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across
portions of eastern Georgia, the coastal plain of South Carolina and
southeast North Carolina through Wednesday.</p>
<p>About 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota,
Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police
Department said in a social media post. Just north of Sarasota,
officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were
rescued from flood waters.</p>
<p>“Essentially we’ve had twice the amount of the rain that was
predicted for us to have,” Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said
on social media.</p>
<p>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that the state could continue to see
threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.</p>
<p>“It is a very saturating, wet storm,” he said. “When they crest and
the water that’s going to come down from Georgia, it’s just something
that we’re going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for
the next week.”</p>
<p>Five people had died due to the storm as of Monday night, including a
truck driver on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of
his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over
the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff’s office
divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the
cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida
Highway Patrol.</p>
<p>A 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile
home southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County
Sheriff’s Office. In Dixie County, just east of where the storm made
landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash
on wet roads Sunday night.</p>
<p>In south Georgia, a 19-year-old man died Monday afternoon when a
large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution reported.</p>
<p>More than 140,000 customers remained without power in Florida and
Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from a peak of more than 350,000,
according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp. Nearly
12,000 more were without power in South Carolina early Tuesday. </p>
<p>More than 1,600 flights were also canceled nationwide on Monday and
more than 550 flights were canceled early Tuesday, many of them to and
from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden approved a request from South Carolina’s governor
for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a
similar request from Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he has asked
Biden to issue a preemptive federal emergency declaration to speed the
flow of federal aid to the state.</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris postponed a campaign stop scheduled for
Thursday in Savannah.</p>
<p>North Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy
Cooper declared it in an executive order signed Monday. Several areas
along the state’s coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington
and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping
Program.</p>
<p>North Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic
floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more
than $1 billion in damage.</p>
<p>In 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well
offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane
Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests.
Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set
rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and
was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South
Carolina.</p>

<p>
By now, there’s a decent chance that you’ve seen a Cybertruck out in the
wild — perhaps
<a href="https://transalt.org/blog/daylighting" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>blocking
the visibility at an intersection</u></a> or surrounded by gawkers in
the
<a href="https://x.com/PopCrave/status/1758492688746192964?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1758492688746192964%7Ctwgr%5E3795b9483f8c71cd14e09f3f32b9d902780e93f7%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ffuturism.com%2Fthe-byte%2Flady-gaga-grocery-store-tesla-cybertruck" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Whole
Foods parking lot</u></a>. And upon seeing it, I’ll bet you had
precisely one question:
</p>
<p>
<em><em>How does a Cybertruck function in rural Maine?</em></em>
</p>
<p>
Tucker Carlson is on the case. On Monday, the <em><em>Tucker on
X</em></em> host posted an hour-long video to determine whether a “man
with a real job” could replace his F-350 with a Cybertruck. I’ll be
honest: Out of respect for my time and sanity, I did not actually watch
<a href="https://x.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1820505150244413449" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
entire thing</u></a>. But within the first three minutes, Carlson’s
interview subject — a guy who’d been loaned a Cybertruck for all of five
days — confirmed that he could swap out his Ford for a Tesla with a
resounding “so far, yes.”
</p>
<p>
It was not the only unexpected Cybertruck endorsement of Monday,
however. On the other end of the Eastern Seaboard, at Mar-a-Lago, Donald
Trump appeared in his own
(<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/05/us/harris-trump-election/28b2cf31-0b30-5a9d-8508-97fe1bc2c2d9?smid=url-share" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>also

Adin Ross</u></a>. Over an hour into the livestream, Ross presented the
former president with a custom Cybertruck featuring a red, white, and
blue “Make America Great Again” wrap and the picture of Trump lifting
his fist in the air after the attempt on his life in Pennsylvania
emblazoned on its side. (In addition to
<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/adin-ross-trump-rolex-cybertruck-interview-1235074316/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>possibly
committing a campaign finance violation</u></a>, the pair also
inadvertently proved that the only thing more outré than owning a
Cybertruck is owning a Cybertruck <em><em>with your own face on
it</em></em>.)

<p>
For anyone who has followed
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-electric-vehicles-fact-check" target="_self"><u>the
Republican Party’s stance on EVs</u></a>, the fact that an all-electric
truck is now apparently being used to own the libs might cause your head
to explode. But on the other hand: <em><em>Of course it is</em></em>.
While the far right has for years pushed the idea that EVs are
<a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/pete-buttigieg-marjorie-greene-electric-cars-b2196087.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>somehow
emasculating</u></a>, Tesla designed the Cybertruck to be just the
opposite. It’s such a
<a href="https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/drew-magary-cybertruck-review-sf-19561381.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>conspicuously
masculine status symbol</u></a> that it provoked an anthropologist to
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/22/style/elon-musk-tesla-cybertruck.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wonder</u></a>
to <em><em>The New York Times</em></em> whether “I’ll ever see a nice
lady driving this kind of car.” The right’s change of heart on EVs (or
at least one EV) has also coincided
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-ev-pivot-elon-musk" target="_self"><u>neatly</u></a>
with Elon Musk’s announcement of a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-ev-pivot-elon-musk" target="_self"><u>new
conservative super PAC</u></a>. (Musk is credited as the supplier of the
loaner vehicle in Carlson’s video.)
</p>
<p>
But is it possible the right’s embrace of the Cybertruck could have
benefits beyond giving us amusing, if extremely long videos? The upside,
of course, is that the planet would be much better off if every person
who’d ever bought a gas-guzzling truck to project an image of
“<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/01/pickup-trucks-men-masculinity-rural-symbols/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rural
culture and manhood</u></a>” had decided to get an EV instead. Removing
political and cultural barriers to EVs <em><em>as a whole </em></em>is
certainly something to celebrate, even while
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-ev-pivot-elon-musk#:~:text=Tesla%20shares%20popped%204%25%20after%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20most%20recent%20comments%2C%20and%20the%20company%20is%20now%20big%20enough%20not%20to%20need%20the%20government%20subsidies%20that%20Trump%20would%20inevitably%20roll%20back.%20(Of%20course%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20a%20different%20story%20for%20Tesla%E2%80%99s%20rivals.)" target="_self"><u>the
exact motivations remain suspect</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
And hey, I won’t turn my nose up at more fast chargers in rural Maine.

After the surge downward in stock prices yesterday, U.S. stock index
futures have stabilized for now. The kindling for the Monday fire sale
was Friday’s weaker-than-expected jobs report. We’ll hear more and learn
from an expert how best to deal with anxiety and your investment

<h2 id="toward-a-more-perfect-carbon-removal-standard">Toward a More

<p class="drop-caps">
There’s a new player in carbon removal. It’s not another startup
building machines to suck carbon from the air. And it’s not another
trade association or consulting firm or marketplace peddling carbon
removal credits. Instead, it wants to help establish a different system
for advancing carbon removal — one where the challenging but important
goal of scrubbing CO2 from the atmosphere is treated as a public good
and not just a business opportunity.
</p>
<p>
It’s called the Carbon Removal Standards Initiative, and it’s run by Anu
Khan, the former deputy director of science and innovation at Carbon180.
CRSI (pronounced like the Lannister queen in <em>Game of Thrones</em>,
“Cersei”) is a “financially unconflicted, independent nonprofit,” that
will provide technical assistance to policymakers, regulators, and
nongovernmental organizations in quantifying carbon removal outcomes.
</p>
<p>
A group providing technical assistance may not sound like a
revolutionary development. But Khan hopes CRSI will be a fulcrum around
which the entire industry can begin to pivot.
</p>
<p>
Today’s carbon removal industry is built on selling credits, each of
which is supposed to represent one ton of CO2 pulled out of the
atmosphere. But the market is almost entirely self-regulated. The
standards for measuring and reporting how much carbon a given project is
removing have either been developed by the carbon credit registries that
take a cut of the sales or by the developers themselves — in both cases
a conflict of interest, even if governed by the best of intentions.
Plus, there’s a
<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/14693062.2022.2094308" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>multitude
of standards</u></a> for every type of project, and they vary in
quality.
</p>
<p>
Take carbon farming, for example. If a farmer alters their practices to
increase the carbon stored in their soil, they can choose from more than
a dozen standards to quantify the effects. In theory, the standards all
produce an identical product — a fungible carbon credit equivalent to
one ton of carbon removed from the atmosphere. In reality, they
<a href="https://carbonplan.org/research/soil-protocols-explainer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>vary
widely in quality</u></a>, with some standards producing more accurate
results than others.
</p>
<p>
In watching this environment develop over the past several years, I’ve
often wondered if some independent, unbiased entity might eventually
step forward to enact one set of standards to rule them all. Khan told
me that about a year and a half ago, she had the same thought. “Oh, to
be so young,” she said.
</p>
<p>
At the time, there was growing concern that the carbon removal industry
would suffer from the same credibility issues that plagued the wider
market for carbon credits. “You have a multiplicity of these
verification entities driven by profit motives, some of which have very
loose standards,” Wil Burns, the co-executive director of the Institute
for Carbon Removal Law and Policy at American University, told me. “From
the standpoint of those purchasing credits or those viewing whether
companies are doing anything meaningful, nobody can really distinguish.”
</p>
<p>
In early 2023, dozens of carbon removal suppliers, buyers, verifiers,
academics, and nonprofit staff — including Khan — signed an
<a href="https://files.carbonplan.org/CDR-MRV-Standards-Letter-02-10-2023.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>open
letter</u></a> that now reads like an early draft of CRSI’s missions
statement. It called for the creation of “an independent, not-for-profit
initiative that conscientiously avoids conflicts of interest and has
funding that does not depend on issuing or selling carbon credits.” This
new body would “provide a trusted, scientific stamp of approval for CDR
protocols through an inclusive process to identify scientific
consensus.”
</p>
<p>
The letter focused on the issues with measuring carbon removal in the
context of the voluntary sale of carbon credits. But over the next year,
it became clear to Khan that carbon removal won’t reach the scale
necessary to make a dent in climate change without government policy.
“Even the market enthusiasts recognize that we’re going to need policy
as quickly as possible to shore this up,” she said, “and it’s going to
be policy, long term, that gets us to gigaton scale.”
</p>
<p>
So instead of providing “a trusted, scientific stamp of approval” to
private businesses, CRSI is laser focused on working with policymakers.
It’s not entirely clear yet what that will look like, and it’s likely to
evolve as CRSI finds its footing. But the group is launching with a few
projects that are already underway. It has created a database of
“quantification resources,” which is basically a list of all of the
methodologies published by companies, academics, government agencies,
and international standards organizations, for measuring different kinds
of carbon removal. It also has a database of carbon removal policies,
both those enacted and proposed. Eventually, Khan plans to have them
link out to each other, so you can see which standards underpin which
policies.
</p>
<p>
Khan wants CRSI to be a go-to resource for policymakers and agency staff
to ensure that carbon removal programs actually result in climate
benefits. “We are fundamentally a mission organization,” she told me.
“We believe that carbon removal is a tool for climate justice. Justice
requires accountability, and in carbon removal, that means knowing how
to count the carbon. We want to make sure that if we’re putting public
dollars into these policies, that they are backed by the ability to
actually measure the carbon.”
</p>
<p>
Khan isn’t the only one whose thinking on standards has shifted toward a
government-led approach. Burns, who also signed the letter, told me he’s
seeing more carbon removal companies pushing for a compliance market,
where the government requires polluting businesses to buy carbon
removal. “They would like to both have government standards that would
provide more confidence, for example, to investors,” he said, “and they
would like government mandates that generate more demand.”
</p>
<p>
Freya Chay is the program lead at the nonprofit Carbon Plan, which
spearheaded the letter. She told me many in the industry are now
thinking about carbon removal programs that don’t revolve around selling
credits at all, and therefore may have very different measurement and
verification needs.
</p>
<p>
One of CRSI’s first projects is an illustrative example. Imagine if the
Department of Agriculture developed a program to help farmers restore
the pH of soils that have gotten too acidic, by adding basalt — a
mineral that also happens to capture CO2 from the atmosphere as it
dissolves. Today, carbon removal companies that sell carbon credits
based on this process are taking hundreds of soil samples to measure the
outcomes. The USDA likely wouldn’t need that level of precision — the
captured CO2 is a co-benefit, not the entire point of the program — but
“at some point you probably do want to know if you removed carbon
through this policy,” said Khan. CRSI is working on
<a href="https://www.carbonremovalstandards.org/jurisdiction-level-monitoring-of-enhanced-weathering" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>figuring
out how you would do that</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, we might see the development of building codes that encourage
the use of
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/concrete-traps-co2-soaked-air-climate-friendly-test-2023-02-03/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>concrete
cured with CO2</u></a> from the atmosphere, or waste management
regulations that govern the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/vaulted-deep-carbon-removal" target="_self"><u>injection
of carbon-rich organic waste</u></a> into underground storage wells.
Bigger picture, the U.S. will eventually have to measure and report how
much carbon removal it’s doing across all of these little programs as
part of its obligation under the Paris Agreement.
</p>
<p>
In many of these cases, those setting the rules won’t be experts in
carbon removal science. “They’re going to need technical expertise,”
said Khan. “We want to make sure that when they are doing that work,
they have access to all of the relevant information, and that it’s
organized in a way that’s legible for the expertise that they already
have.”
</p>
<p>
Shuchi Talati, the former chief of staff in the office of fossil energy
and carbon management at the Department of Energy, told me that having
this kind of centralized resource would definitely have been useful.
“The private sector has a lot of power right now in setting standards
because the public sector doesn’t have the capacity,” she said. And
since the field is so diverse, efforts are spread across a bunch of
different agencies that don’t always talk to each other. Talati sits on
the board of CRSI, and for her, the focus on government is not just
about helping carbon removal scale.
</p>
<p>
“If we’re allowing the private sector to set standards and norms — and
maybe they’re fine right now — but if we continue to let that happen, I
can see the actual climate benefit of CDR slipping away,” Talati said.
“That’s really where I see Anu’s organization fit in, where we are
trying to set standards and norms from this core, foundational principle
of a public good.”

<h2 id="kamala-harris-is-now-democratic-presidential-nominee">Kamala
Harris is now Democratic presidential nominee</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris, a daughter of immigrants
who rose through the California political and law enforcement ranks to
become the first female vice president in U.S. history, formally secured
the Democratic presidential nomination on Monday — becoming the first
woman of color to lead a major party ticket.</p>
<p>More than four years after her first attempt at the presidency
collapsed, Harris’ coronation as her party’s standard-bearer caps a
tumultuous and frenetic period for Democrats prompted by President Joe
Biden’s disastrous June debate performance that shattered his own
supporters’ confidence in his reelection prospects and spurred
extraordinary intraparty warfare about whether he should stay in the
race.</p>
<p>Just as soon as Biden abruptly ended his candidacy, Harris and her
team worked rapidly to secure backing from the 1,976 party delegates
needed to clinch the nomination in a formal roll call vote. She reached
that marker at warp speed, with an Associated Press survey of delegates
nationwide showing she locked down the necessary commitments a mere 32
hours after Biden’s announcement.</p>
<p>Harris’ nomination became official after a five-day round of online
balloting by Democratic National Convention delegates ended Monday
night, with the party saying in a statement released just before
midnight that 99% of delegates had cast their ballots for Harris. The
party had long contemplated the early virtual roll call to ensure Biden
would appear on the ballot in every state. It said it would next
formally certify the vote before holding a celebratory roll call at the
party’s convention later this month in Chicago.</p>
<p>An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll
conducted after Biden withdrew found 46% of Americans have a favorable
view of Harris, while a nearly identical share has an unfavorable view
of her. But more Democrats say they are satisfied with her candidacy
compared with that of Biden, energizing a party that had long been
resigned to the 81-year-old Biden being its nominee against former
President Donald Trump, a Republican they view as an existential
threat.</p>
<p>Already Harris has telegraphed that she doesn’t plan to veer much
from the themes and policies that framed Biden’s candidacy, such as
democracy, gun violence prevention and abortion rights. But her delivery
can be far fierier, particularly when she invokes her prosecutorial
background to lambast Trump and his 34 felony convictions for falsifying
business records in connection with a hush money scheme.</p>
<p>“Given that unique voice of a new generation, of a prosecutor and a
woman when fundamental rights, especially reproductive rights, are on
the line, it’s almost as if the stars have aligned for her at this
moment in history,” said Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California, who
was tapped to succeed Harris in the Senate when she became vice
president.</p>
<p>A splash in Washington before a collapse in the 2020 primaries</p>
<p>Kamala Devi Harris was born Oct. 20, 1964, in Oakland, California, to
Shyamala Gopalan, a breast cancer scientist who emigrated to the United
States from India when she was 19 years old, and Stanford University
emeritus professor Donald Harris, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally
from Jamaica. Her parents’ advocacy for civil rights gave her what she
described as a “stroller’s-eye view” of the movement.</p>
<p>She spent years as a prosecutor in the Bay Area before her elevation
as the state’s attorney general in 2010 and then election as U.S.
senator in 2016.</p>
<p>Harris arrived in Washington as a senator at the dawn of the volatile
Trump era, quickly establishing herself as a reliable liberal opponent
of the new president’s personnel and policies and fanning speculation
about a presidential bid of her own. Securing a spot on the coveted
Judiciary Committee gave her a national spotlight to interrogate
prominent Trump nominees, such as now-Supreme Court Justice Brett
Kavanaugh.</p>
<p>“I’m not able to be rushed this fast,” then-Attorney General Jeff
Sessions said during a 2017 hearing as Harris repeatedly pressed him on
potential conversations with Russian nationals. “It makes me
nervous.”</p>
<p>Harris launched her 2020 presidential campaign with much promise,
drawing parallels to former President Barack Obama and attracting more
than 20,000 people to a kickoff rally in her hometown. But Harris
withdrew from the primary race before the first nominating contest in
Iowa, plagued by staff dissent that spilled out into the open and an
inability to attract enough campaign cash.</p>
<p>Harris struggled to deliver a consistent pitch to Democratic voters
and wobbled on key issues such as health care. She suggested she backed
eliminating private insurance for a full government-run system —
“Medicare for All” coverage — before releasing her own health care plan
that preserved private insurance. Now, during her nascent general
election campaign, Harris has already reversed some of her earlier, more
liberal positions, such as a ban on fracking that she endorsed in
2019.</p>
<p>And while Harris tried to deploy her law enforcement background as an
asset in her 2020 presidential campaign, it never attracted enough
support in a party that couldn’t reconcile some of her past
tough-on-crime positions at a time of heightened focus on police
brutality.</p>
<p>Joining Biden’s team — and an evolution as vice president</p>
<p>Still, Harris was at the top of the vice presidential shortlist when
Biden was pondering his running mate, after his pledge in early 2020
that he would choose a Black woman as his No. 2. He was fond of Harris,
who had forged a close friendship with his now-deceased son Beau, who
had been Delaware’s attorney general when she was in that job for
California.</p>
<p>Her first months as vice president were far from smooth. Biden asked
her to lead the administration’s diplomatic efforts with Central America
on the root causes of migration to the United States, which triggered
attacks from Republicans on border security and remains a political
vulnerability. It didn’t help matters that Harris stumbled in big
interviews, such as in a 2021 sit-down with NBC News’ Lester Holt when
she responded dismissively that “I haven’t been to Europe” when the
anchor noted that she hadn’t visited the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>For her first two years, Harris also was often tethered to Washington
so she could break tie votes in the evenly divided Senate, which gave
Democrats landmark wins on the climate and health care but also
constrained opportunities for her to travel around the country and meet
voters.</p>
<p>Her visibility became far more prominent after the 2022 Supreme Court
ruling that dismantled Roe v. Wade, as she became the chief spokesperson
for the administration on abortion rights and was a more natural
messenger than Biden, a lifelong Catholic who had in the past favored
restrictions on the procedure. She is the first vice president to tour
an abortion clinic and speaks about reproductive rights in the broader
context of maternal health, especially for Black women.</p>
<p>Throughout her vice presidency, Harris has been careful to remain
loyal to Biden while emphasizing that she would be ready to step in if
needed. That dramatic transition began in late June after the first
debate between Biden and Trump, where the president’s stumbles were so
cataclysmic that he could never reverse the loss of confidence from
other Democrats.</p>
<p>Headed to the top of the ticket</p>
<p>After Biden ended his candidacy July 21, he quickly endorsed Harris.
And during the first two weeks of her 2024 presidential bid, enthusiasm
among the Democratic base surged, with donations pouring in, scores of
volunteers showing up at field offices and supporters swelling so much
in numbers that event organizers have had to swap venues.</p>
<p>The Harris campaign now believes it has a renewed opportunity to
compete in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia — states that
Biden had started to abandon in favor of shoring up the so-called “blue
wall” states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“The country is able to see the Kamala Harris that we all know,” said
Bakari Sellers, who was a national co-chair of her 2020 campaign. “We
really didn’t allow the country to see her” four years ago. Sellers
said: “We had her in bubble wrap. What people are seeing now is that
she’s real, she’s talented.”</p>
<p>Yet Democrats are anticipating that Harris’ political honeymoon will
wear off, and she is inevitably going to come under tougher scrutiny for
Biden administration positions, the state of the economy and volatile
situations abroad, particularly in the Middle East. Harris has also yet
to answer extended questions from journalists nor sit down for a formal
interview since she began her run.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign has been eager to define Harris as she continues
to introduce herself to voters nationwide, releasing an ad blaming her
for the high number of illegal crossings at the southern border during
the Biden administration and dubbing her “Failed. Weak. Dangerously
liberal.”</p>
<p>The Republican nominee’s supporters have also derisively branded
Harris as a diversity hire, while Trump himself has engaged in ugly
racial attacks of his own, wrongly asserting that Harris had in the past
only promoted her Indian heritage and only recently played up her Black
identity.</p>
<p>His remarks are previewing a season of racist and sexist claims
against the person who would be the first woman and the first person of
South Asian heritage in the presidency.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she
happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black,” Trump
said while addressing the annual convention of the National Association
of Black Journalists. “So, I don’t know, is she Indian or is she
Black?”</p>
<p>In her response, Harris called it “the same old show — the
divisiveness and the disrespect” and said voters “deserve better.”</p>
<p>“The American people deserve a leader who tells the truth, a leader
who does not respond with hostility and anger when confronted with the
facts,” Harris said at a Sigma Gamma Rho sorority gathering in Houston.
“We deserve a leader who understands that our differences do not divide
us.”</p>

id="ex-trump-attorney-to-cooperate-in-arizona-fake-electors-case-charges-to-be-dropped">Ex-Trump
attorney to cooperate in Arizona fake electors case, charges to be
dropped</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>phoenix — Former President Donald Trump’s campaign attorney Jenna
Ellis, who worked closely with Rudy Giuliani, will cooperate with
Arizona prosecutors in exchange for charges being dropped against her in
a fake electors case, the state attorney general’s office announced
Monday.</p>
<p>Ellis has previously pleaded not guilty to fraud, forgery and
conspiracy charges in the Arizona case. Seventeen other people charged
in the case have pleaded not guilty to the felony charges — including
Giuliani, Trump presidential chief of staff Mark Meadows and 11
Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring Trump
had won Arizona.</p>
<p>“Her insights are invaluable and will greatly aid the State in
proving its case in court,” Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a
statement. “As I stated when the initial charges were announced, I will
not allow American democracy to be undermined — it is far too important.
Today’s announcement is a win for the rule of law.”</p>
<p>Last year, Ellis was charged in Georgia after she appeared with
Giuliani at a December 2020 hearing hosted by state Republican lawmakers
at the Georgia Capitol during which false allegations of election fraud
were made. She had pleaded guilty in October to one felony count of
aiding and abetting false statements and writings. The cooperation
agreement signed by Ellis in the Arizona case requires her to provide
truthful information to the Attorney General’s Office and testify
honestly in proceedings in any state or federal court. Prosecutors can
withdraw from the deal and refile charges if Ellis violates the
agreement.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have already asked a court to dismiss the Arizona charges
against Ellis. It wasn’t immediately clear if a judge had yet approved
the request.</p>
<p>The Associated Press left messages with Ellis’ attorney, Matthew
Brown, after the agreement was announced Monday.</p>
<p>While not a fake elector in Arizona, prosecutors say Ellis made false
claims of widespread election fraud in the state and six others,
encouraged the Arizona Legislature to change the outcome of the election
and encouraged then-Vice President Mike Pence to accept Arizona’s fake
elector votes.</p>
<p>The indictment said Ellis, Giuliani and other associates were at a
meeting at the Arizona Legislature on Dec. 1, 2020, with then-House
Speaker Rusty Bowers and other Republicans when Giuliani and his team
asked the speaker to hold a committee hearing on the election.</p>
<p>When Bowers asked for proof of election fraud, Giuliani said he had
proof but Ellis had advised that it was left back at a hotel room, the
indictment said. No proof was provided to Bowers.</p>
<p>Ellis also is barred from practicing law in Colorado for three years
after her guilty plea in Georgia.</p>
<p>Prosecutors in Michigan, Nevada, Georgia and Wisconsin have also
filed criminal charges related to the fake electors scheme.</p>
<p>Arizona authorities unveiled the felony charges in late April.
Overall, charges were brought against 11 Republicans who submitted a
document to Congress falsely declaring Trump had won Arizona, five
lawyers connected to the former president and two former Trump aides.
President Joe Biden won Arizona by 10,457 votes.</p>
<p>Trump himself was not charged in the Arizona case but was referred to
as an unindicted co-conspirator in the indictment.</p>
<p>The 11 people who claimed to be Arizona’s Republican electors met in
Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were “duly
elected and qualified” electors and asserting that Trump carried the
state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social
media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was
later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was
ignored.</p>

<h2 id="biden-aims-to-defuse-mideast-tensions-1">Biden aims to defuse
Mideast tensions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>THE WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Joe Biden met with his national
security team Monday and spoke with Jordan’s king to defuse heightened
tensions in the Middle East after a pair of high-profile assassinations
last week.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, warned Israel would
exact a “heavy price” if attacked by Iran or its proxies in the
region.</p>
<p>The White House said over the weekend that it was committed to a
hostage-release and cease-fire deal that had so far been elusive — but
emphasized that Washington stood ready to respond and had surged
military resources to the region.</p>
<p>“We still believe a cease-fire deal is the best way to bring this war
to an end,” John Kirby, White House national security spokesman, said.
“It’s also, we believe, very possible. We still believe the gaps are
narrow enough to close. The other thing that we’ve been doing since the
7th of October is making sure that not only Israel has what it needs to
defend itself, but that this war doesn’t escalate to become something
broader.”</p>
<p>Analysts say this is a tense moment.</p>
<p>“I think one of the reasons that this is also scary, to be honest,
for everybody, is that it isn’t clear what the United States can do when
we’re on the brink like this,” said Natasha Hall, a senior fellow with
the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies.</p>
<p>Advocates for the American Muslim community, which has criticized
Biden’s staunch support for Israel, say Washington should take a firm
line on Israel’s aggression in Gaza.</p>
<p>“The United States possesses a wide array of diplomatic and political
tools to hold Israel accountable, whether that’s withholding aid,
ammunition, weapons, political support or sanctioning more of Israel’s
far-right settlers that have been engaged in violence,” said Robert
McCaw, Government Affairs Department director at the Council on
American-Islamic Relations.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said Israel is ready to meet challenges.</p>
<p>“Iran and its proxies seek to surround us with a stranglehold of
terror on seven fronts,” he said. “Their visible aggression is
insatiable, but Israel is not helpless. We are determined to stand
against them on every front, in every arena, far and near. Anyone who
murders our citizens, anyone who harms our country, will be held
accountable. He will pay a very heavy price.”</p>
<p>Jordan Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi recently paid a rare visit to
Tehran, and Biden on Monday spoke to Jordan’s King Abdullah II about
de-escalating tensions in the region.</p>
<p>Hall says diplomacy may be the best way forward.</p>
<p>“What he [Safadi] wanted to do was play essentially a mediating role
in much the same way that Qatar has been doing in recent months,” she
said. “Just speak to Iran, try to address their concerns, but also to be
essentially a conduit for the United States to ensure that there’s some
kind of open channel during these particularly scary times.</p>
<p>“And I think that that is more necessary than ever before, since the
United States does not directly speak to high-ranking Iranian officials.
And so, they are depending on these kinds of regional mediators,
probably more so than ever before,” Hall said.</p>
<p>So, with nearly 40,000 people dead, Gaza in ruins, and Lebanon and
Iran on high alert, the world is waiting to see what happens next.</p>
<p>A reporter asked Biden about one of the key players in the conflict
as he left church on Sunday.</p>
<p>“Do you think Iran will stand down, sir?” the reporter said.</p>
<p>“I hope so,” Biden replied. “I don’t know.”</p>

id="dow-drops-1000-points-japanese-stocks-plunge-as-markets-quake-worldwide">Dow
drops 1,000 points; Japanese stocks plunge as markets quake
worldwide</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — A scary Monday that started with a plunge abroad
reminiscent of 1987’s crash swept around the world and pummeled Wall
Street with more steep losses, as fears worsened about a slowing U.S.
economy.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 dropped 3% for its worst day in nearly two years. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average reeled by 1,033 points, or 2.6%, while the
Nasdaq composite slid 3.4% as Apple, Nvidia and other Big Tech companies
that used to be the stars of the stock market continued to wilt.</p>
<p>The drops were the latest in a global sell-off that began last week.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 helped begin Monday by plunging 12.4% for its worst
day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.</p>
<p>It was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday’s
report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much
more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the
U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it’s all raised fear
the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too
much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling
inflation.</p>
<p>Professional investors cautioned that some technical factors could be
amplifying the action in markets, and that the drops may be overdone,
but the losses were still neck-snapping. South Korea’s Kospi index
careened 8.8% lower, and bitcoin dropped below $54,000 from more than
$61,000 on Friday.</p>
<p>Even gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during
tumultuous times, slipped about 1%.</p>
<p>That’s in part because traders began wondering if the damage has been
so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an
emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The
yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for
the Fed, briefly sank below 3.70% during the morning from 3.88% late
Friday and from 5% in April. It later recovered and pulled back to
3.89%.</p>
<p>“The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big
rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,” said
Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “Those are
usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate
of 4.3% doesn’t really seem like an emergency.”</p>
<p>Of course, the U.S. economy is still growing, the U.S. stock market
is still up a healthy amount for the year and a recession is far from a
certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking
when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive
would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more
oxygen and hurt everyone.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a
recession within the next 12 months following Friday’s jobs report. But
he still sees only a 25% probability of that, up from 15%, in part
“because the data look fine overall” and he does not “see major
financial imbalances.”</p>
<p>Some of Wall Street’s recent declines may simply be air coming out of
a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in
part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology.</p>
<p>“Markets tend to move higher like they’re climbing stairs, and they
go down like they’re falling out a window,” according to JJ Kinahan, CEO
of IG North America. He chalks much of the recent worries to euphoria
around AI subsiding, with pressure rising on companies to show how AI is
turning into profits, and “a market that was ahead of itself.”</p>
<p>Treasury yields also pared their losses Monday after a report said
growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected.
Growth was led by arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along
with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for
Supply Management.</p>
<p>Still, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the
economy’s strength took sharp losses on the fears about a slowdown. The
small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 3.3%, washing out what
had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.</p>
<p>Making things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks tumbled as the
market’s most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel.
Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the
“Magnificent Seven” had propelled the S&amp;P 500 to record after record
this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of
the stock market.</p>
<p>But Big Tech’s momentum turned last month on worries investors had
taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are
becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports
that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism
and accelerated the declines.</p>
<p>All told, the S&amp;P 500 fell 160.23 points to 5,186.33. The Dow
sank 1,033.99 to 38,703.27, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 576.08 to
16,200.08.</p>

<p>
Cool, cool. I already post <em>very</em> regularly, but I appreciate the
spirit of this, and I’m delighted to take part.
</p>
<p>
I discovered this via
<a href="https://andypiper.co.uk/2024/08/04/a-re-introduction-to-my-blog/">Andy
Piper’s post</a>, and I like the way he’s taken a step back and
(re-)introduced himself. So I’ll try and do the same.
</p>
<p>
You can learn more about me <a href="https://about.werd.io">on my About
page</a> or on <a href="https://resume.werd.io">my narrative resumé</a>,
which collectively explain who I am and how I got here at length. Or at
least, they explain the professional version of me. So perhaps this
“about me” can be a little more personal.
</p>
<h3>
About Me
</h3>
<p>
I’m Ben Werdmuller. I’m in my mid-40s. My mother’s family are half
Russian Jews whose village was burned down in pogroms conducted by the
White Army, and half institutional east coast Americans who can be
traced back to the Mayflower. My dad’s are Indonesian, Swiss, and Dutch:
the Werdmuller von Elggs are a Swiss aristocratic family of textile
merchants who were involved in the Reformation, among other things. My
dad is one of the youngest survivors of Japanese concentration camps in
Indonesia.
</p>
<p>
We moved around a bit when I was a kid, but the closest thing I have to
a hometown is Oxford, England. These days I live in Greater
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, after twelve years or so in the San
Francisco Bay Area. I also lived in Edinburgh, Scotland, for close to a
decade.
</p>
<p>
I see the world through a strongly internationalist lens, am fiercely
pro-union and anti-war, love immigration, and believe in a strong Europe
as long as it is a force for inclusive democracy and peace. I mostly
align with progressive principles and emphatically reject the idea that
the political center is the most reasonable — particularly in America,
where the universal healthcare, gun control, and educational principles
that are just accepted in most of the rest of the developed world are
somehow considered to be incredibly left-wing.
</p>
<p>
I’ve lost five members of my family, including my mother, to a (so-far)
incurable, genetic telomere dysfunction. Although I’m grateful to not
have the genetic trait, I would gladly have exchanged it with them. It
doesn’t and must not define any of their lives, but it hangs over my
family. We’ve experienced a lot of loss in a short time and we miss them
all terribly.
</p>
<p>
I’ve <a href="https://resume.werd.io">founded a handful of startups</a>,
have been the first employee at a few more, and generally find myself in
CTO roles across smaller, growing organizations. A few years ago I took
a sharp career turn and started leading technology in non-profit
newsrooms, because I became more and more concerned about the state of
the world and wanted to be on the side of strengthening democracy. These
days I lead tech at <a href="https://propublica.org">ProPublica</a>. I
care a lot about supporting the fediverse and the
<a href="https://indieweb.org">indie web</a>, which I see as incredibly
liberating in a human way: they’re how the web should be.
</p>
<p>
I’m a lifelong <a href="https://www.doctorwho.tv/">Doctor Who</a> fan. I
remember watching
<a href="https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/Resurrection_of_the_Daleks_(TV_story)">the
Daleks chase Peter Davison’s Doctor</a> when I was very small, and I
still look forward to every new story.

wrote this story about the 50th anniversary</a>, eleven years ago now.
</p>
<p>
I care about using technology to make the world more informed and equal.
If we’re not doing that, what’s the point?

<h3>
About My Blog
</h3>
<p>
Over time my blog has transitioned from just being my indie space to
mostly talking about the intersection of tech and media. It’s led to
working interesting jobs and meeting interesting people. I don’t have a
ton of time to build new software or write longer work, but I’ve made
reflecting here an integral part of my life. Lately I’ve been thinking
about making it more personal again.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been blogging since 1998, which feels like a very long time ago,
but this particular space has been going since 2013. Prior to that, I
blogged at
<a href="https://benwerd.com/2013/05/31/werd-io-and-idno/">benwerd.com</a>,
which I keep online as an archive. My sites before that have been lost
to time but are probably still available on the Internet Archive.
</p>
<p>
This site runs on <a href="https://known.co">Known</a>. I write posts
using <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a>, and power the email

Every so often I ask readers here
<a href="https://airtable.com/app68RpySPG9rjHll/shroodj2nnni0ecCX">what

<h2
id="chinese-businesses-hoping-to-expand-in-us-face-uncertainty-suspicion">Chinese
businesses hoping to expand in US face uncertainty, suspicion</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — It was billed as the “biggest ever economic development
project” in north Michigan when Governor Gretchen Whitmer in 2022
welcomed a Chinese lithium-ion battery company’s plan to build a $2.36
billion factory and bring a couple thousand jobs to Big Rapids. </p>
<p>Now the project by Gotion High-Tech is in the crosshairs of some U.S.
lawmakers and residents. </p>
<p>Leading the charge is Republican Representative John Moolenaar of
Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, who accuses
the Chinese company of having ties to forced labor and says he fears it
could spy for Beijing and work to extend China’s influence in the U.S.
heartland. Gotion rejects the accusations. </p>
<p>“I want to see this area have more jobs and investments, but we must
not welcome companies that are controlled by people who see us as the
enemy and we should not allow them to build here,” Moolenaar said at a
recent roundtable discussion in Michigan. </p>
<p>Lured by the large U.S. market, Chinese businesses are coming to the
United States with money, jobs and technology, only to find rising
suspicion at a time of an intensifying U.S.-China rivalry that has
spread into the business world. </p>
<p>U.S. wariness of China, coupled with Beijing’s desire to protect its
technological competitiveness, threatens to rupture ties between the
world’s two largest economies. That could hurt businesses, workers and
consumers, which some warn could undermine the economic foundation that
has helped stabilize relations. </p>
<p>“This is a lose-lose scenario for the two countries,” Zhiqun Zhu,
professor of political science and international relations at Bucknell
University, said in an email. “The main reason is U.S.-China rivalry,
and the U.S. government prioritizes ‘national security’ over economic
interests in dealing with China.” </p>
<p>Lizhi Liu, an assistant professor of business at Georgetown
University, said the trend, along with the decline of U.S. investments
in China, could hurt China-U.S. relations. </p>
<p>“Strong investment ties between the two nations are crucial not only
for economic reasons but also for security, as intertwined economic
interests reduce the likelihood of major conflicts or even war,” she
said. </p>
<p>But U.S. lawmakers believe the stakes are high. Senator Marco Rubio
said at a July hearing that China is not only a military and diplomatic
adversary for the U.S. but also a “technological, industrial and
commercial” opponent. </p>
<p>“The technological and industrial high ground has always been a
precursor of global power,” said Rubio, a Republican from Florida.  </p>
<p>The bipartisan House Select Committee on China has warned that
widespread adoption in the U.S. of technologies developed by China could
threaten long-term U.S. technological competitiveness. </p>
<p>U.S. public sentiment against Chinese investments began to build
during President Barack Obama’s administration, in a pushback against
globalization, and were amplified after President Donald Trump came into
office, said Yilang Feng, an assistant professor of business at
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who studies economic
nationalism and resistance to foreign direct investments in the
U.S. </p>
<p>“The scale has increased, so has the intensity,” Feng said. </p>
<p>As President Joe Biden’s administration seeks to revive American
manufacturing and boost U.S. technological capabilities, many
politicians believe Chinese companies should be kept out. </p>
<p>“Can you imagine working for an American company working tirelessly
to develop battery technology and then you find out that your tax
dollars are being used to subsidize a competitor from China?” Moolenaar
said as he campaigned against the Gotion project in his congressional
district in a state that is critical in the presidential election. </p>
<p>Whitmer’s office has declined to comment on the project. The Michigan
Economic Development Corporation told The Associated Press it has
received “bipartisan support at all levels” to move forward with the
project, which will create up to 2,350 jobs. </p>
<p>Residents of Green Charter Township, however, revolted against the
project over its Chinese connections last year when they removed five
officials who supported it in a recall election. </p>
<p>In Worcester, Massachusetts, the Chinese biotech company WuXi
Biologics paused construction of a large facility a few weeks after
lawmakers introduced a bill that would, over data security concerns, ban
U.S. entities receiving federal funds from doing business with several
China-linked companies, WuXi Biologics included. </p>
<p>John Ling, who has helped South Carolina and Georgia attract Chinese
businesses for nearly two decades, said geopolitics have been getting in
the way in recent years. Chinese companies are less likely to consider
South Carolina after the state senate last year approved a bill banning
Chinese citizens from buying property, even though the bill has yet to
clear the statehouse, Ling said. </p>
<p>Data by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis show the total
investments by China in the U.S. fell to just under $44 billion in 2023,
from a high point of $63 billion in 2017, although first-year
expenditures rose to $621 million in 2023, up from $531 million in 2022
but drastically down from the high of $27 billion in 2016. The figures
include acquisitions, new business establishments and expansions. </p>
<p>In 2022, Michigan beat out several other states in luring Gotion.
Keen to revive its manufacturing base, the state offered a package of
incentives, including $175 million in grants and the approval of a new
zone that could save the company $540 million. Local townships approved
tax abatements for Gotion to build a factory to make components for
electrical vehicle batteries. </p>
<p>In Green Charter Township, the new board dropped support for the
project and rescinded an agreement to extend water to the factory site,
only to be rebuked by a U.S. district judge. </p>
<p>The future of the plant remains uncertain, as Moolenaar is rallying
support for his bill that would prevent Gotion from receiving federal
subsidies. He accuses the company of using forced labor, after
congressional staff discovered links between the company and Xinjiang
Production Construction Corps., a paramilitary group sanctioned by the
U.S. Commerce Department for its involvement in China’s forced labor
practice. </p>
<p>Chuck Thelen, vice president of manufacturing of Gotion North
America, recently called the forced labor accusations “categorically
false and clearly intended to deceive.”</p>

personnel wounded in attack against base in Iraq, officials say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — At least five U.S. personnel were injured in an attack
against a military base in Iraq on Monday, U.S. officials told Reuters,
as the Middle East braced for a possible new wave of attacks by Iran and
its allies following last week’s killing of senior members of militant
groups Hamas and Hezbollah.</p>
<p>Two Katyusha rockets were fired at al Asad airbase in western Iraq,
two Iraqi security sources said. One Iraqi security source said the
rockets fell inside the base. It was unclear whether the attack was
linked to threats by Iran to retaliate over the killings.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Iran said the U.S. bears responsibility in the
assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran because of its
support for Israel.</p>
<p>The U.S. officials, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity,
said one of the wounded Americans was seriously injured. The casualty
count was based on initial reports which could still change, they
said. </p>
<p>“Base personnel are conducting a post-attack damage assessment,” one
of the officials added.</p>
<p>Last week the U.S. carried out a strike in Iraq against individuals
U.S. officials said were militants getting ready to launch drones and
posed a threat to U.S. and coalition forces.</p>
<p>The U.S. has been watching to see if Iran would make good on its vow
to respond to the killing of Haniyeh two days ago in Tehran, one in a
series of killings of senior figures in the Palestinian militant group
as the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza rages.</p>
<p>The Pentagon has said it will deploy additional fighter jets and Navy
warships to the Middle East, as Washington seeks to bolster defenses
following threats from Iran and its allies Hamas and Hezbollah.</p>
<p>A rare ally of both the U.S. and Iran, Iraq hosts 2,500 U.S. troops
and has Iran-backed militias linked to its security forces. It has
witnessed escalating tit-for-tat attacks since the Israel-Hamas war
erupted in October.</p>
<p>Iraq wants troops from the U.S.-led military coalition to begin
withdrawing in September and to formally end the coalition’s work by
September 2025, Iraqi sources have said, with some U.S. forces likely to
remain in a newly negotiated advisory capacity.</p>
<p>Baghdad has struggled to reign in Iran-backed armed groups that have
attacked U.S. forces there and in neighboring Syria dozens of times
since Oct. 7.</p>
<p>Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani spoke with U.S.
Secretary of State Anthony Blinken on Sunday.</p>
<p>An Iraqi official said Blinken asked Sudani to help decrease regional
tensions by helping to convince Iran to temper its response to an
Israeli strike in Tehran that killed the leader of Hamas last week. </p>
<p>U.S. Army General Michael “Erik” Kurilla, head of U.S. Central
Command, is currently in the Middle East. One of the U.S. officials said
Kurilla was speaking with allies to ensure there was coordination in
case of an Iranian attack against Israel.</p>

id="us-judge-rules-google-is-a-monopoly-search-deals-with-apple-and-mozilla-in-peril">US
judge rules Google is a monopoly, search deals with Apple and Mozilla in
peril</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>That sure is a big news drop for a random Tuesday. A federal judge
ruled that Google violated US antitrust law by maintaining a monopoly in
the search and advertising markets. “After having carefully considered
and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the
following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to
maintain its monopoly,” according to the court’s ruling, which you can
read in full at the bottom of this story. “It has violated Section 2 of
the Sherman Act.” ↫ Lauren Feiner at The Verge Among many other things,
the judge mentions Google’s own admissions that the company can do
pretty much whatever it wants with Google Search and its advertisement
business, without having to worry about users opting to go elsewhere or
ad buyers leaving the Google platform. Studies from inside Google itself
made it very clear that Google could systematically make Search worse
without it affecting user and/or usage numbers in any way, shape, or
form – because users have nowhere else to realistically go. While the
ability to raise prices at will without fear of losing customers is a
sure sign of being a monopoly, so is being able to make a product worse
without fear of losing customers, the judge argues. Google plans to
appeal, obviously, and this ruling has nothing yet to say about
potential remedies, so what, exactly, is going to change is as of yet
unknown. Potential remedies will be handled during the next phase of the
proceedings, with the wildest and most aggressive remedy being a
potential break-up of Google, Alphabet, or whatever it’s called today.
My sights are definitely set on a break-up – hopefully followed by
Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft – to create some much-needed
breathing room into the technology market, and pave the way for a
massive number of newcomers to compete on much fairer terms. Of note is
that the judge also put yet another nail in the coffin of Google’s
various exclusivity deals, most notable with Apple and, for our
interests, with Mozilla. Google pays Apple well over 20 billion dollars
a year to be the default search engine on iOS, and it pays about 80% of
Mozilla’s revenue to be the default search engine in Firefox. According
to the judge, such deals are anticompetitive. Mehta rejected Google’s
arguments that its contracts with phone and browser makers like Apple
were not exclusionary and therefore shouldn’t qualify it for liability
under the Sherman Act. “The prospect of losing tens of billions in
guaranteed revenue from Google — which presently come at little to no
cost to Apple — disincentivizes Apple from launching its own search
engine when it otherwise has built the capacity to do so,” he wrote. ↫
Lauren Feiner at The Verge If the end of these deals become part of the
package of remedies, it will be a massive financial blow to Apple – 20
billion dollars a year is about 15% of Apple’s total annual operating
profits, and I’m also pretty sure those Google billions are counted as
part of Tim Cook’s much-vaunted services revenue, so losing it would
definitely impact Apple directly where it hurts. Sure, it’s not like
it’ll make Apple any less of a dangerous behemoth, but it will
definitely have some explaining to do to investors. Much more worrisome,
however, is the similar deal Google has with Mozilla. About 80% of
Mozilla’s total revenue comes from a search deal with Google, and if
that deal were to be dissolved, the consequences for Mozilla, and thus
for Firefox, would be absolutely immense. This is something I’ve been
warning about for years now, and the end of this deal would be yet
another worry that I’ve voiced repeatedly becoming reality, right after
Mozilla becoming an advertising company and making Firefox worse in the
name of quick profits. One by one, every single concern I’ve voiced
about the future of Firefox is becoming reality. Canonical, Fedora, KDE,
GNOME, and many other stakeholders – ignore these developments at your
own peril.</p>

Supreme Court declines to halt Trump’s sentencing in hush money
case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected a bid by the
state of Missouri to halt Donald Trump’s upcoming sentencing for his
conviction in New York on felony charges involving hush money paid to an
adult film star and left a related gag order until after the November 5
presidential election.</p>
<p>The decision by the justices came in response to Missouri’s lawsuit
claiming that the case against Trump infringed on the right of voters
under the U.S. Constitution to hear from the Republican presidential
nominee as he seeks to regain the White House.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s order was unsigned. Conservative Justices
Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito indicated they would have taken up
Missouri’s case but added that they “would not grant other relief.”</p>
<p>Trump was found guilty in May of falsifying business records to cover
up a $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels in exchange for
her silence before the 2016 U.S. election about a sexual encounter she
has said she had with Trump years earlier. Prosecutors have said the
payment was designed help Trump’s chances in the 2016 election, when he
defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>Trump, the Republican candidate in this year’s election, denies
having had sex with Daniels and has vowed to appeal his conviction after
his sentencing, scheduled for September.</p>
<p>Missouri’s Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a July 3
lawsuit against New York state asking the Supreme Court to pause Trump’s
impending sentencing and the gag order placed on him by New York state
judge Juan Merchan.</p>
<p>Legal disputes between states are filed directly to the Supreme
Court.</p>
<p>Bailey argued that the criminal case against Trump violated the right
of Missouri residents under the Constitution’s First Amendment to “hear
from and vote for their preferred presidential candidate.”</p>
<p>“Instead of letting presidential candidates campaign on their own
merits, radical progressives in New York are trying to rig the 2024
election by waging a direct attack on our democratic process,” Bailey
said in bringing the case.</p>
<p>Republican attorneys general from Florida, Iowa, Montana and Alaska
filed a Supreme Court brief in support of Missouri’s lawsuit.</p>
<p>Trump also faces federal and state criminal charges involving his
efforts to undo his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court in a July 1 ruling powered by its 6-3 conservative
majority granted Trump substantial criminal immunity for actions taken
in office. It all but ensured Trump would not face trial in the federal
election subversion case before the election.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers promptly invoked the immunity ruling in a bid to toss
the hush money verdict. They said prosecutors improperly relied on
social media posts made in 2018 by Trump when he was serving as
president that qualified as official communications.</p>
<p>The judge in the case said he would rule on Trump’s arguments by
September 6. Merchan said that if he upholds the conviction, he would
sentence Trump on September 18.</p>
<p>A New York state appeals court last week rejected Trump’s challenge
to his gag order. The decision by the Appellate Division in Manhattan
means Trump, who has called all the criminal cases against him
politically motivated, cannot comment publicly about individual
prosecutors and others in the case until his sentencing.</p>

id="secretaries-of-state-urge-elon-musk-to-fix-ai-chatbot-spreading-election-misinformation-on-x">Secretaries
of state urge Elon Musk to fix AI chatbot spreading election
misinformation on X</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Chicago — Five secretaries of state are urging Elon Musk to fix an AI
chatbot on the social media platform X, saying in a letter sent Monday
that it has spread election misinformation.</p>
<p>The top election officials from Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico,
Pennsylvania and Washington told Musk that X’s AI chatbot, Grok,
produced false information about state ballot deadlines shortly after
President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race.</p>
<p>While Grok is available only to subscribers to the premium versions
of X, the misinformation was shared across multiple social media
platforms and reached millions of people, according to the letter. The
bogus ballot deadline information from the chatbot also referenced
Alabama, Indiana, Ohio and Texas, although their secretaries of state
did not sign the letter. Grok continued to repeat the false information
for 10 days before it was corrected, the secretaries said.</p>
<p>The letter urged X to immediately fix the chatbot “to ensure voters
have accurate information in this critical election year.” That would
include directing Grok to send users to CanIVote.org, a voting
information website run by the National Association of Secretaries of
State, when asked about U.S. elections.</p>
<p>“In this presidential election year, it is critically important that
voters get accurate information on how to exercise their right to vote,”
Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon said in a statement. “Voters
should reach out to their state or local election officials to find out
how, when, and where they can vote.”</p>
<p>X did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Grok debuted last year for X premium and premium plus subscribers and
was touted by Musk as a “rebellious” AI chatbot that will answer “spicy
questions that are rejected by most other AI systems.”</p>
<p>Social media platforms have faced mounting scrutiny for their role in
spreading misinformation, including about elections. The letter also
warned that inaccuracies are to be expected for AI products, especially
chatbots such as Grok that are based on large language models.</p>
<p>“As tens of millions of voters in the U.S. seek basic information
about voting in this major election year, X has the responsibility to
ensure all voters using your platform have access to guidance that
reflects true and accurate information about their constitutional right
to vote,” the secretaries wrote in the letter.</p>
<p>Since Musk bought Twitter in 2022 and renamed it to X, watchdog
groups have raised concerns over a surge in hate speech and
misinformation being amplified on the platform, as well as the reduction
of content moderation teams, elimination of misinformation features and
censoring of journalists critical of Musk.</p>
<p>Experts say the moves represent a regression from progress made by
social media platforms attempting to better combat political
disinformation after the 2016 U.S. presidential contest and could
precipitate a worsening misinformation landscape ahead of this year’s
November elections.</p>

urged countries to ‘pass messages’ to Iran against escalation, State
Department says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States has been urging countries through its
diplomatic engagements to tell Iran that escalation in the Middle East
is not in their interest, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller
said Monday. </p>
<p>Speaking at a daily briefing, Miller said this was a “critical
moment” for the region and that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken
was working the phones to help calm the tensions, but also said
Washington was preparing for all possibilities. </p>
<p>Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in the Iranian capital
Tehran last week, an attack that drew threats of revenge on Israel and
fueled further concern that the conflict in Gaza was turning into a
wider Middle East war. </p>
<p>Iran has blamed Israel and has said it will “punish” it; Israeli
officials have not claimed responsibility for the killing. Iran backs
Hamas, which is at war with Israel in Gaza, and also supports the
Lebanese group Hezbollah, whose senior military commander Fuad Shukr was
killed in an Israeli strike on Beirut last week. </p>
<p>The top U.S. diplomat spoke Monday with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh
Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr
Abdelatty on the tensions in the Middle East. </p>
<p>“One of the points of the engagements that we have had is to urge
countries to pass messages to Iran and urge countries to make clear to
Iran that it is very much not in their interests to escalate this
conflict, that it is very much not in their interest to launch another
attack on Israel,” he said. </p>
<p>Miller did not say definitively whether Washington’s messages have
been disseminated to Iran or through which channel. </p>
<p>“I would expect that some of them would pass that message along and
impress that point upon the government of Iran,” he added.</p>

id="google-loses-massive-antitrust-case-over-its-search-dominance">Google
loses massive antitrust case over its search dominance</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A judge on Monday ruled that Google’s ubiquitous search
engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition
and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the
internet and hobble one of the world’s best-known companies.</p>
<p>The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit
Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S.
Justice Department against Google in the country’s biggest antitrust
showdown in a quarter century.</p>
<p>After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top
executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year’s 10-week
trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three
months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early
May.</p>
<p>“After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony
and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a
monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,” Mehta
wrote in his 277-page ruling.</p>
<p>It represents a major setback for Google and its parent, Alphabet
Inc., which had steadfastly argued that its popularity stemmed from
consumers’ overwhelming desire to use a search engine so good at what it
does that it has become synonymous with looking things up online.</p>
<p>Google’s search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion
queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12
years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm
BOND.</p>
<p>Google almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that
ultimately may land in the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>For now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice
Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald
Trump was still president and has been escalating it efforts to rein in
Big Tech’s power during President Joe Biden’s administration.</p>
<p>The case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically
has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the
centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240
billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that
Google’s monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high
prices while also enjoying the luxury of having to invest more time and
money into improving the quality of its search engine — a lax approach
that hurt consumers.</p>
<p>As expected, Mehta’s ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google
spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on
new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than
$26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his
ruling.</p>
<p>Google ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have
historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with
the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo — now a minor player
on the internet — was the most popular search engine during the 1990s
before Google came along.</p>
<p>Mehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default
settings. He noted that Microsoft’s Bing search engine has 80% share of
the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that
shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in
as the predetermined default option.</p>
<p>Still, Mehta credited the quality of Google’s product as an important
part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that “Google is widely
recognized as the best [general search engine] available in the United
States.”</p>
<p>Mehta’s conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly
sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or
penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a
more competitive landscape.</p>
<p>Besides boosting Microsoft’s Bing search engine, the outcome could
hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the
age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the
early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta’s
market-rattling decision.</p>
<p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department’s star
witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google
deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the
Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more
than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.</p>
<p>“You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth, and you search on
Google,” Nadella said at one point in his testimony. “Everybody talks
about the open web, but there is really the Google web.”</p>
<p>Nadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown
to ensure the situation didn’t get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in
search.</p>
<p>Google still faces other legal threats besides this one, both in the
U.S. and abroad. any antitrust lawsuits brought against Google
domestically and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to
begin in Virginia over the Justice Department’s allegations that
Google’s advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.</p>

id="every-microsoft-employee-is-now-being-judged-on-their-security-work">Every Microsoft employee
is now being judged on their security work</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>After a number of very bug security incidents involving Microsoft’s
software, the company promised it would take steps to put security at
the top of its list of priorities. Today we got another glimpse of the
step it’s taking, since the company is going to take security into
account during performance reviews. Kathleen Hogan, Microsoft’s chief
people officer, has outlined what the company expects of employees in an
internal memo obtained by The Verge. “Everyone at Microsoft will have
security as a Core Priority,” says Hogan. “When faced with a tradeoff,
the answer is clear and simple: security above all else.” A lack of
security focus for Microsoft employees could impact promotions,
merit-based salary increases, and bonuses. “Delivering impact for the
Security Core Priority will be a key input for managers in determining
impact and recommending rewards,” Microsoft is telling employees in an
internal Microsoft FAQ on its new policy. ↫ Tom Warren at The Verge Now,
I’ve never worked in a corporate environment or something even remotely
close to it, but something about this feels off to me. Often, it seems
that individual, lower-level employees know all too well they’re cutting
corners, but they’re effectively forced to because management expects
almost inhuman results from its workers. So, in the case of a technology
company like Microsoft, this means workers are pushed to write as much
code as possible, or to implement as many features as possible, and the
only way to achieve the goals set by management is to take shortcuts –
like not caring as much about code quality or security. In other words,
I don’t see how Microsoft employees are supposed to make security their
top priority, while also still having to achieve any unrealistic goals
set by management and other higher-ups. What I’m missing from this memo
and associated reporting is Microsoft telling its employees that if
unrealistic targets, crunch, low pay, and other factors that contribute
to cutting corners get in the way of putting security first, they have
the freedom to choose security. If employees are not given such freedom,
demanding even more from them without anything in return seems like a
recipe for disaster to me, making this whole memo quite moot. We’ll have
to see what this will amount to in practice, but with how horrible
employees are treated in most industries these days, especially in
countries with terrible union coverage and laughable labour protection
laws like the US, I don’t have high hopes for this.</p>

<h2 id="years-ago-cpm-started-the-microcomputer-revolution">50 years
ago, CP/M started the microcomputer revolution</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>CP/M is turning 50 this year. The ancient Control Program for
Microcomputers, or CP/M for short, has been enjoying a modest
renaissance in recent years. By 21st century standards, it’s
unimaginably tiny and simple. The whole OS fits into under 200 kB, and
the resident bit of the kernel is only about 3 kB. Today, in the era of
end-user OSes in the tens-of-gigabytes size range, this exerts a
fascination to a certain kind of hobbyist. Back when it was new, though,
this wasn’t minimalist – it was all that early hardware could support. ↫
Liam Proven I’m a little too young to have experienced CP/M as anything
other than a retro platform – I’m from 1984, and we got our first
computer in 1990 or so – but its importance and influence cannot be
overstated. Many of the conventions set by CP/M made their way to the
various DOS variants, and in turn, we still see some of those
conventions in Windows today. Had Digital Research, the company CP/M
creator Gary Kildall set up to sell CP/M, accepted the deal with IBM to
make CP/M the default operating system for the then newly-created IBM
PC, we’d be living in a very different world today. Digital Research
would also create several other popular and/or influential software
products beyond CP/M, such as DR DOS and GEM, as well as various other
DOS variants and CP/M versions with DOS compatibility. It would
eventually be acquired by Novell, where it faded into obscurity.</p>

rules that Google ‘is a monopolist’ in US antitrust case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;known-bookmark&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;e-content&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
[<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24155520/judge-rules-on-us-doj-v-google-antitrust-search-suit">Lauren
Feiner at The Verge</a>]
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“A federal judge ruled that Google violated US antitrust law by
maintaining a monopoly in the search and advertising markets.
</p>
<p>
“After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and
evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a
monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,” the
court’s ruling, which you can read in full at the bottom of this story,
reads. “It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.”“
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is seismic, both for Google and for the web. As The Verge points
out, this is so far about liabilities, not about any prescriptive
remedy. But as one of the major factors in the decision was the payments
that Google makes to browser manufacturers, it seems likely that any
remedy will change how this works. In turn, the impact across tech could
be significant.
</p>
<p>
Apple received $20 billion from Google in 2022 to be the default search
engine (it shares 36% of ad revenue from Safari users with the company).
That’s a big number, but nothing compared to its $394bn in total
revenue. But for Mozilla, the impact might be more profound:
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-05-05/why-google-keeps-paying-mozilla-s-firefox-even-as-chrome-dominates">in
2021, these payments represented 83% of its revenue</a>. What happens to
it without this underwriting?
</p>
<p>
It’s too early to say exactly what will change, but this is also
potentially a gift for the new batch of AI startups that are trying to
seize search engine ground. The era of the internet flux that we’ve
found ourselves in - wherein everything is once again up for grabs and
seemingly-entrenched incumbents change dramatically at a moment’s notice
- shows no sign of slowing.

Favorite Shadow VC</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzAyMTcxMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3ODcyNTU1Mn0.kgi6uOoyws_zwnAZI7-ma4Z0aDv6fgg3ZUbe5Lqusn4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
When the George W. Bush administration established the Advanced Research
Projects Agency - Energy, better known as ARPA-E, the number one
<a href="https://arpa-e.energy.gov/about/authorization" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>goal</u></a>
for the new agency sounded an ambitious and patriotic note: “To enhance
the economic and energy security of the United States through the
development of energy technologies.” And from that uncontroversial
foundation, a bipartisan bastion of cleantech innovation was born.
</p>
<p>
I knew I wanted to dig into the critical role that ARPA-E plays in the
climate tech funding landscape after Rajesh Swaminathan, a partner at
Khosla Ventures, told me that he views the agency as the “least talked
about VC in town.” So I reached out to ARPA-E’s director, Evelyn Wang,
to learn more.
</p>
<p>
Of course, ARPA-E isn’t actually a venture capital firm — it provides
no-strings-attached funding to promising energy projects rather than
aiming for a return on investment. “So a little bit different,” Wang
told me. “Our mission is very much focused on energy independence,
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and enhancing energy efficiency.”
</p>
<p>
The Bush administration established ARPA-E in 2007 with the passage of
the America COMPETES Act, which aimed to improve the technological
competitiveness of the United States via investments in research and
development. But the agency was funded for the first time in 2009, under
Obama, as a part of an $800 billion stimulus package in response to the
Great Recession. A substantial chunk of that funding — $90 billion — was
allocated for clean energy, which the
<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/25/fact-sheet-recovery-act-made-largest-single-investment-clean-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>administration
would go on to boast</u></a> amounted to the “largest single investment
in clean energy in history.”
</p>
<p>
Yet whether it’s been Bush or Obama — or Trump or Biden — in the White
House, the messaging around ARPA-E has always trended less towards
renewables and climate mitigation and more towards energy security and
economic competitiveness. As the name suggests, ARPA-E is modeled after
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, which was
established in 1958 in response to the Soviet’s launch of the Sputnik
satellite. DARPA has since helped birth such little-known tech as the
entire internet, GPS, automated voice recognition, and self-driving
cars.
</p>
<p>
But while the de facto customer for DARPA-developed tech is always the
Department of Defense, the pathway to commercialization for ARPA-E
projects mainly relies on private sector interest. In that sense, the
goal of ARPA-E is neatly aligned with that of venture capitalists: Get
tech to market. Because while scientific learnings are all well and
good, Wang said that “ultimately, we need to see these technologies
commercialized — to actually <em><em>be out there </em></em>— to
actually affect the ecosystem and change the energy landscape.”
</p>
<p>
Since ARPA-E can eschew the profit motive, it’s able to fund high-risk,
high-reward projects at the earliest stages, when most investors would
be reluctant to take on that level of uncertainty. Yet the inherent risk
means the success rate for ARPA-E projects
<a href="https://arpa-e.energy.gov/about/our-impact" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>as
measured by metrics</u></a> such as the number of companies it’s spawned
(157), exits via mergers, acquisitions or IPOs (30), and additional
partnerships with other government agencies (360), can seem low compared
to the 1,590 projects that the agency has funded over the past 15 years.
A climate tech investor I spoke with on background told me that while
they love ARPA-E and are glad it exists, they were expecting more
success stories by now.
</p>
<p>
That’s at least partially because even after a project is funded and
proof-of-concept has been demonstrated, there’s often still a ways to go
before investors are ready to jump in. “I think when we first stood up
ARPA-E, the idea was that at that point, it would be sufficiently
de-risked for the private sector to then pick it up and invest,” Wang
told me. But frequently, that hasn’t been the case. ARPA-E usually funds
projects for one to three years, but often climate tech innovation
relies on deeply complex and thus inherently slow advancements in
science and engineering — think fusion energy, novel battery
development, or direct air capture. Many venture funds have 10 year time
horizons, so if investors don’t see a payoff happening in that
timeframe, they’ll probably hold back.
</p>
<p>
The investor I spoke with on background told me that ARPA-E has become
more effective in partnership with the Office of Clean Energy
Demonstrations, established in 2021 under the Department of Energy,
which uses its $25 billion budget to create model buildouts of new
technology with private sector partners. Earlier this year, OCED
selected
<a href="https://arpa-e.energy.gov/news-and-media/blog-posts/six-arpa-e-awardees-among-teams-set-receive-775m-funding-part-historic" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>six
ARPA-E awardees</u></a> focused on industrial decarbonization to receive
a combined total of up to $775 million.
</p>
<p>
Even so, the investor told me, ARPA-E funding alone still might not be
enough to get companies to a place where OCED would be interested. To
help close that gap, ARPA-E started a program called SCALEUP, a mouthful
of an acronym for The Seeding Critical Advances for Leading Energy
(Technologies) with Untapped Potential, in 2019. It provides a small
number of ARPA-E projects with follow-on funding to further prove out
their concepts — provided they can identify at least one
commercialization partner such as a potential customer, end-user, or
supplier willing to take a stake in the development of the tech and help
it get to market.
</p>
<p>
So far, Wang says the program has yielded some successes. The list
includes LongPath Technologies, which monitors methane emissions and
leaks in the oil and gas industry and
<a href="https://www.longpathtech.com/news/longpath-technologies-secures-up-to-189m-conditional-loan-commitment-from-u-s-department-of-energy-for-usa-methane-emissions-monitoring-network" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>received
a conditional loan</u></a> last year from the DOE’s Loan Programs
Office; Natron Energy, which just opened the
<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240428240613/en/Natron-Energy-Achieves-First-Ever-Commercial-Scale-Production-of-Sodium-Ion-Batteries-in-the-U.S." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>first
commercial-scale</u></a> sodium-ion battery production facility in the
U.S.; and
<a href="https://arpa-e.energy.gov/news-and-media/arpa-e-disruptors/sila-nanotechnologies" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Sila</u></a>,
a battery materials manufacturer that has raised over $1.3 billion in
total, and secured contracts with Mercedes-Benz and Panasonic.
</p>
<p>
When you look at ARPA-E’s success rate in terms of dollars in and
dollars out, though, it starts to look pretty darn efficacious as is.
Since 2009, ARPA-E has provided more than $3.8 billion for research and
development, leading to over $12.6 billion in private-sector follow-on
funding, while the 30 exits to date have yielded a combined market
valuation of $22.2 billion. And since it often takes climate tech
companies
<a href="https://www.ctvc.co/exits-analysis-clean-tech-climate-tech/#:~:text=The%20median%20time%20from%20founding,companies%20and%20private%20equity%20firms." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>around
a decade</u></a> to mature to the point where they’re ready for an exit
event, many of ARPA-E’s companies have yet to reach the acquisition or
IPO threshold.
</p>
<p>
These days, ARPA-E projects are facing a completely different funding
landscape than in the 2000s — one ripe with both excitement and cash as
well as increasing competition. So while Wang told me that the agency’s
goal is always to look for “technological whitespace” in the energy
landscape, “it’s getting more crowded,” she said. “And I think in that
context, we’ve strategically decided that we should also think about
broader vision type efforts.” To that end, ARPA-E has
<a href="https://arpa-e.energy.gov/news-and-media/press-releases/arpa-e-announces-150-million-develop-systems-provide-abundant-primary" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>identified
three comprehensive focus areas</u></a>: developing clean primary energy
sources such as geothermal, small modular nuclear reactors, fusion and
geologic hydrogen; power delivery for non-electrical sources, such as
energy transported via hydrogen or heat; and figuring out how to source
carbon sustainably, such as via engineered plants and algae.
</p>
<p>
Now that ARPA-E has been supporting projects for a decade and a half,
it’s getting more experimental when it comes to developing novel
testbeds for its tech. Exhibit A is the San Antonio International
Airport,
which<a href="https://arpa-e.energy.gov/news-and-media/press-releases/arpa-e-announces-innovation-agreement-outlining-vision-future" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
<u>recently signed a memorandum of understanding</u></a> with the agency
to deploy a series of ARPA-E backed technologies.
</p>
<p>
Many major airports are actually higher tech than passengers may
realize, and given the mounting pressure on the aviation industry to
decarbonize, they’re also open to novel sustainability solutions. In San
Antonio, the airport is deploying EV chargers from Imagen Energy and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/sodium-batteries-china" target="_self"><u>sodium-ion
battery tech</u></a> from Natron Energy, both of which could help
electrify their ground vehicles, as well as a distributed energy
management system from Autogrid, which allows airports to control their
virtual power plants, microgrids, EV fleet, and demand response
measures. Other tech, such as hybrid-electric planes from Ampaire, could
be integrated into the airport in the future.
</p>
<p>
That’s a lot of technology development for not many headlines. And when
a company raises a major round or goes public, sometimes you have to dig
deep to discover their ARPA-E origins. Hence, the “least talked about VC
in town” comment. In some sense, Wang says, this is intentional.
</p>
<p>
“When we think about success, if our teams, our companies are
successful, and they shine, then we shine,” she told me, and maybe
that’s the way it should continue to be. Because while advertising
government investment in anything seen as “clean” or “green” can
immediately draw both partisan praise and ire, funding for ARPA-E has
been steadily creeping up nearly every year since 2015. And yes, that
includes the Trump era, even though the former president
<a href="https://time.com/4703638/donald-trump-budget-energy-arpa-epa/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>seemingly
wanted to axe the agency</u></a> altogether. Congress, it turned out,
was not on board with that plan.
</p>
<p>
“Our mission is about energy independence and bolstering our economy and
I think everyone agrees with this mission,” Wang told me. “Everyone,” of
course, will always be an overstatement. But perhaps Wang is right that
the agency does function better as a behind-the-scenes player. As she
put it, speaking of the companies the agency funds, “It’s more about
them, right? And how that affects the ecosystem, and helps our nation in
terms of what we need to do as a country, and how that sets an example
for the world.”

have more depth than anyone at pool, but gold harder to come by</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NANTERRE, France — No one can match America’s depth at the
pool.  </p>
<p>That said, claiming the top step on the Olympic medal podium is no
longer a given for U.S. swimmers.  </p>
<p>Nine days of thrilling competition at La Defense Arena wrapped up
Sunday night with the Americans barely pulling out the lead in the gold
medal standings thanks to a victory in the last race.  </p>
<p>The U.S. finished with eight golds, its fewest since the 1988 Seoul
Games and one ahead of its biggest rival, Australia.  </p>
<p>“It’s one of the worst performances in history as a U.S. team,”
Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian ever and part of the NBC
broadcast team in Paris, said Monday. “Something’s got to happen before
2028 because if you have a repeat like this, it’s gonna be even more
embarrassing.”  </p>
<p>Notably, the rest of the world totaled more victories (20) than the
United States and Australia combined, the first time that’s happened
since the 1996 Atlanta Games.  </p>
<p>The Americans will certainly be intent on improving their performance
heading into the home games at Los Angeles in 2028, when swimming will
have in its largest, most spectacular setting yet — a temporary pool
inside SoFi Stadium with a capacity for some 38,000 fans.  </p>
<p>Still, with more and more international swimmers getting their
training in the U.S. — and prominent American coaches such as Bob Bowman
spreading their knowledge to other countries — a more diverse list of
gold medalists is likely to be the norm going forward.  </p>
<p>“This sport is growing and I can’t help but feel like we’ve been a
part of that,” American gold medalist Bobby Finke said. “It’s something
we should take home and be proud of.”  </p>
<p>Two of the biggest swimming stars in Paris, France’s Léon Marchand
and Canada’s Summer McIntosh, train in the U.S. but won a bevy of medals
for their home countries.  </p>
<p>Marchand, who captured four individual golds as well as a relay
bronze, is coached by Bowman, best known as the guy who guided Michael
Phelps throughout his record-setting career. It was a bit strange to see
Bowman in a France shirt, working on the coaching staff of Marchand’s
nation.  </p>
<p>After a break to savor his Olympic triumph, Marchand will return to
the U.S. to continue his work with Bowman, who now heads the swimming
program at the University of Texas.  </p>
<p>“Look at Bob Bowman. He doesn’t care if you’re from the USA or
whatever,” said Shane Ryan, an American-born swimmer who competes for
Ireland. “He just wants to coach the fastest swimmers at all
times.”  </p>
<p>McIntosh trains with a team in Sarasota, Florida, where she honed the
form that produced three individual gold medals — the most ever by a
Canadian athlete — and a silver.  </p>
<p>“I think competition is great,” said longtime American stalwart Ryan
Murphy, who trains with several international athletes at Cal-Berkeley
including Spain’s Hugo González. “He’s pushed me a lot. There’s plenty
of days where he’s right next to me and helping me get better.”  </p>
<p>Murphy said it’s only natural in today’s information-driven world
that more nations are rising up to challenge the U.S.   </p>
<p>“People will take a video of what they’re doing in practice and put
it up on social media right away,” he said. “The learning curve is so
quick around the world. That’s a big reason why there’s so many talented
athletes across the world now.”  </p>
<p>The U.S. certainly has its shining moments in Paris.  </p>
<p>Katie Ledecky won two more golds, moving her into a tie for second
place among all athletes on the career list with nine. She also joined
Phelps as the only swimmers to win the same event at four straight
Summer Games with her victory in the 800-meter freestyle.  </p>
<p>The women’s team produced several more stars, including Torri Huske
(three golds, two silvers), Gretchen Walsh (two golds, two silvers) and
Regan Smith (two golds, three silvers).  </p>
<p>But there were plenty of disappointments, particular on the men’s
side.  </p>
<p>Caeleb Dressel, a big star at the Tokyo Games with five gold medals,
finished sixth in the 50 freestyle and didn’t even qualify for the final
of the 100 butterfly.  </p>
<p>Murphy settled for a bronze in the 100 backstroke and, like Dressel,
failed to qualify for the final of his other individual event, the 200
back.  </p>
<p>In all, the American men produced only two gold medals, and they
didn’t pick up an individual victory until Finke’s world record in the
1,500 freestyle on the final night.   </p>
<p>“You always want to be better,” said Anthony Nesty, head coach of the
men’s team. “Yes, we want our athletes to win gold medals, but the other
teams have great athletes as well. We have to go back, all the coaches
in the U.S., get back on it and hopefully four years from now we have a
better result. From the men, for sure.”  </p>
<p>The depth of the American team remains its biggest strength. Even
with four of its most prominent stars — Dressel, Murphy, Lilly King and
Simone Manuel — managing only one individual medal (Murphy’s bronze in
the 100 back), the U.S. easily led the overall medals table with
28.  </p>
<p>Three of the four world records set at the meet came from the
Americans, two of them in relays.  </p>
<p>“Whether our athletes won a gold medal or failed to make a semifinal
or whatever it might be,” said U.S. women’s coach Todd DeSorbo, “you’ve
got to learn from it, go back home and be better.”</p>

economic aide Sperling leaving White House to work on Harris
campaign</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — White House senior adviser Gene Sperling is leaving his
administration position to work with Vice President Kamala Harris’
election campaign as the Democrats step up efforts to challenge Donald
Trump on policy issues in November’s election.</p>
<p>Sperling will be a senior economic adviser to Harris’ policy team.
The shift was revealed by White House officials who spoke on condition
of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.</p>
<p>Sperling served both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama as director of the
White House National Economic Council. President Joe Biden tasked
Sperling with managing his $1.9 trillion pandemic aid package, a role in
which Sperling implemented the temporary expansion of the child tax
credit. He was also the White House liaison to the union and car
companies during the auto strikes.</p>
<p>“Under Gene’s leadership, the American Rescue Plan has delivered
economic relief to cities and counties across the country, protected
millions of union pensions, made the largest-ever federal investment in
public safety, and kept thousands of small businesses afloat,” Biden
said in a statement obtained by The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Sperling first worked with Harris when she was California attorney
general during his time in the Obama administration. He frequently
consulted with her as an outside adviser when she was in the Senate. The
two partnered during the Biden presidency on promoting the monthly
payments for the child tax credit, among other policies.</p>
<p>The pandemic programs halved child poverty with tax credits that went
to 40 million families and provided rental assistance to 8 million.</p>
<p>But Republican critics blame the pandemic aid for sparking higher
inflation, an issue that has hounded the Biden administration as many
voters say that groceries, housing and gasoline have become less
affordable. Financial markets opened Monday with a selloff as a weaker
than expected jobs report last week has raised concerns about the U.S.
economy’s resilience.</p>
<p>The White House has maintained that the inflation was global in
nature, with chief of staff Jeff Zients saying that the efforts
coordinated by Sperling “produced the strongest economy in the
world.”</p>
<p>North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat, described the work
that Sperling spearheaded as “generational investments” and credited him
working with states to get the programs right.</p>

id="americans-abroad-help-countries-grow-womens-basketball-for-olympic-opportunity">Americans
abroad help countries grow women’s basketball for Olympic
opportunity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>VILLENEUVE-D’ASCQ, France — Germany has lots of players who can
score. The Germans knew they needed a point guard for the Paris Games
with the country making its Olympic debut in women’s basketball.  </p>
<p>Alexis Peterson, a native of Columbus, Ohio, has proven to be a
perfect fit.  </p>
<p>The guard who played at Syracuse in college has helped Germany
qualify for Wednesday’s quarterfinals in Paris, and German coach Lisa
Thomaidis said Peterson has been everything they wanted. </p>
<p>“Ball control, that’s always been the issue for us,” Thomaidis said.
“We’ve had to kind of do it by committee. We’ve never really had a true
point guard. We’ve been able to, you know, do it OK. But to get to that
next level? We knew that she was someone that would be a huge
help.”  </p>
<p>Peterson’s not the only American abroad in these Olympics playing for
other countries. The reason? The stacked pipeline of U.S. talent is
essentially impossible to crack, and a FIBA rule allows countries to tap
players with dual citizenships or a player who becomes a naturalized
citizen.  </p>
<p>For Peterson, it’s been a long road.  </p>
<p>Now 29, she was drafted 15th overall in 2017 by the WNBA’s Seattle
Storm. She spent six seasons bouncing around the WNBA from Indiana,
Phoenix and the Las Vegas Aces. She’s played in Israel, Poland and
France.  </p>
<p>Then Germany and Thomaidis reached out to Peterson last summer to
gauge her interest. She had represented the U.S. in 3x3 basketball, so
USA Basketball and the German Basketball Association agreed to a change
of Peterson’s nationality so she could play for Germany.  </p>
<p>“If you recall, like Las Vegas head coach Becky Hammon played for
Russia,” Peterson said of the Aces coach. “So it’s been happening for a
while. Players find opportunities elsewhere and make the most of those
opportunities. So I’m grateful that I was given this opportunity.”  </p>
<p>Peterson has lots of company at these Games playing for other
countries.  </p>
<p>Yvonne Anderson was born in Springdale, Arkansas, and is the daughter
of college coach Mike Anderson. The point guard will be playing in her
second straight Olympic quarterfinals for Serbia against Australia on
Wednesday. She helped Serbia finish fourth three years ago in the Tokyo
Games. </p>
<p>Then, Anderson was fitting into a new team, figuring out her role.
Time has made a big difference. </p>
<p>“At this point, I have a bond with the team,” said Anderson, who has
been wearing a mask protecting the nose she broke earlier this year.
“This is my family. Like, these are my girls. This is my team.” </p>
<p>Megan Gustafson from Port Wing, Wisconsin, played at Iowa and was the
2019 AP women’s player of the year. The 6-foot-4 Gustafson currently is
a backup on the WNBA’s Aces and said yes when Spain asked if she’d be
interested in playing for their team.  </p>
<p>With her scoring and rebounding, Spain was among the first to qualify
for the quarterfinals and will play Belgium on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Gabby Williams has dual citizenship. She played at UConn and was a
late addition to the 2021 French Olympic team that won bronze in Tokyo,
beating Serbia and Anderson.   </p>
<p>Even more special because Williams’ French mother finally got to
watch her daughter play for France in person.  </p>
<p>“I think that was really, really hard on my mum to miss the Olympics
(in Tokyo),” Williams said. “And then, of course, when you have games
when it doesn’t go well and to not have your family there, that’s always
really hard, and then to celebrate without them too is also really
difficult.”   </p>
<p>There are many others.   </p>
<p>Houston native Mya Hollingshed played at Colorado and was the eighth
pick overall by Las Vegas in the 2022 WNBA draft. Her grandfather, Terry
Sykes, was a 1978 NBA draft pick by Washington. She has been playing for
Puerto Rico since the 2022 World Cup.  </p>
<p>Nigeria became the first African team, male or female, to reach the
Olympic quarterfinals in basketball. The roster features five players
born in the U.S. with four others who played at American colleges.
Nigeria plays the U.S. on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Peterson spends up to 11 months a year in Europe with Fairfax,
Virginia, home when in the U.S. Her European experience and being a
pass-first point guard is why Thomaidis saw Peterson as a perfect fit
for Germany’s roster.  </p>
<p>“We knew we had a lot of weapons that we can distribute the ball to,
and she’s been just that,” Thomaidis said.  </p>
<p>Germany wants to make a splash in these Games as a big step toward
hosting the 2026 World Cup. Olympic success will only give women’s
basketball a huge boost in Germany, and these Olympians are getting
messages of support and know people are paying attention.  </p>
<p>“This is huge for German women’s basketball, for little girls in
Germany right now watching us here compete here as the underdogs of our
group and come out is just so inspiring to them,” Peterson said. “And I
know it’ll give them something to look forward to as well.”</p>

Temperatures may still be scorching, but hey, at least you probably
don’t have to swim in the Seine.
</p>
<h3>
Don’t get used to cooler temperatures
</h3>
<p>
The Midwest cooled off a bit over the weekend — but doesn’t mean extreme
temperatures are behind us. <strong>More heat is in store this week for
the Central Plains and the deep South. </strong>A heat dome developing
in the Western side of the country will push hot air over to those
regions, Bryan Jackson, a National Weather Service meteorologist, told
me.
</p>
<p>
“Cities like Denver, Oklahoma City and Kansas City will have
temperatures ranging from 95 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit the rest of the
work week. That’s 6 to 12 degrees above historical averages,” Paul
Pastelok, a senior meteorologist at Accuweather, told me.
</p>
<p>
The conditions in the Southern Plains across the Gulf States into the
interior Southeast will be <strong>even more extreme</strong>, as high
humidity levels will make already high temperatures in cities like
Houston, Memphis, Tennessee, Jackson, Mississippi feel 8 to 10 degrees
hotter, Pastelok explained. To be clear, that means heat indexes as high
as 110.
</p>
<p>
Over in the West, the heat will focus over eastern Oregon, southern
Idaho, Nevada, and central and southern California. According to
Pastelok, Boise, Idaho, will see temperatures above 100 degrees for most
of this week — 8 to 14 degrees above historical averages.
</p>
<h3>
Olympians are having more trouble staying cool than winning medals
</h3>
<p>
Beyond sleeping in cardboard beds and swimming in the Seine (which is
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/04/g-s1-15326/belgian-olympic-swimmer-seine-e-coli-triathlet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>potentially
still full of E.coli</u></a>), athletes are having to deal with the
intense heat in the city.
</p>
<p>
In 2021,
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/05/olympic-athletes-and-volunteers-in-tokyo-tortured-by-heat" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Tokyo
became the hottest Olympic Games ever</u></a>, with daily highs
averaging nearly 90 degrees and the heat index soaring well past 113
degrees. While Paris won’t come close to challenging that, it’s still
been plenty hot. Temperatures in the French capital
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-paris-heat-wave-4ca791e7219d3efb5ba4e84c6d7f8999" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reached
97 degrees</u></a> last Tuesday before settling back into the
<a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/fr/paris/623/august-weather/623" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>high
70s</u></a> over the weekend.
</p>
<p>
To counter the heat, athletes were taking extra breaks to hydrate, but
sometimes not even that was enough. “We were drinking hot water out
there,” British tennis player Jack Draper told
<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/paris-olympics-bracing-heat-wave-soggy-start-112393417" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ABC
News</u></a>. USA gymnast-slash-golden girl Simone Biles also complained
about the heat and having to go around in a bus without AC. Spectators
also struggled, and volunteers had to use a water hose to spray those in
the bleachers at a beach volleyball game.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> After a cooler weekend, temperatures in
Paris will trend warmer again early this week. <strong>The city will
likely see temperatures above 86 degrees today and tomorrow</strong>,
Jason Nicholls, lead international forecaster at Accuweather, told me.
That same cycle will repeat again from mid-week through Friday. One spot
of good news, though, for those toughing it out in the City of Lights:
You’re likely already through the worst of it.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Park Fire rages
</h3>
<p>
The Park Fire is now the
<a href="https://34c031f8-c9fd-4018-8c5a-4159cdff6b0d-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/-/media/calfire-website/our-impact/fire-statistics/top-20-largest-ca-wildfires.pdf?rev=91666785545f4a0783b060277fb340f0&hash=B4502FE6A177E89863B51DEEF49C2F58" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fourth
largest wildfire</u></a> in California’s history — <strong>and there
might still be weeks before it’s quenched</strong>. As of this morning,
only 31% of the fire had been contained, with one more county being
added to the evacuation list. Hundreds of structures have been
destroyed, and over 400,000 acres have been burned.
</p>
<p>
Looking at California’s fire season to date, the numbers are even more
shocking. During the summer of 2023, the state responded to 119 wildfire
incidents. So far this summer — and remember we still have all of August
to go — the state has already responded to <em><em>321
wildfires</em></em>, according to
<a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/our-impact/statistics" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Cal
Fire data</u></a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Looking Ahead: </strong>The chances of putting out the Park Fire
this week are low, as “precipitation is not in the forecast to help
firefighters,” Pastelok told me. <strong>Dry thunderstorms and gusty
winds</strong> coming from the south to southwest predicted for this
week will also make the fire harder to contain. New wildfires in the
region can also be expected.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
“Extended summer” will last into fall
</h3>
<p>
The first couple of weeks of August will continue to see much of the
same extreme heat the country has experienced so far this summer,
according to Pastelok. In fact, the Southeast looks to be getting even
hotter and more humid late this week and into next. In northern
California and parts of Oregon, some cooling may happen around the
middle of the month, but not enough to end the wildfire season.
<strong>More significant opportunities for cooler weather in the region
won’t start until September — or even October. </strong>
</p>
<p>
Seattle and Portland may get lucky with a more substantial drop in
temperatures later in August, but the Northeast will continue hot and
humid throughout all of this month. The location of the cooler weather
will mostly be determined by storms, Pastelok explained. “If more storms
hit the East coast, the cooling will drive into the Midwest,” he said.
“If the storms drive into the Gulf, then warmth will remain back to the
Midwest and cooling will be more confined to the northern Rockies and
Northwest.”
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> From September through November,
meteorologists at AccuWeather expect temperatures to be 1 to 3 degrees
above historical averages. <strong>The only region that will be spared
is the Pacific Northwest</strong>, where cooler, wetter weather will pop
up earlier. This also means that the risk of extreme weather events,
such as tornadoes and wildfires, will continue high through the end of
the year.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
The coldest place on the planet is not even that cold anymore
</h3>
<p>
Not even Antarctica is safe from bizarre temperatures this summer.
<strong>Last month, an intense heat wave caused temperatures across the
continent to average up to 50 degrees above normal.</strong>
Temperatures were up 82 degrees from historical readings on some days.
</p>
<p>
The numbers confirm what climate scientists have been telling us for
years: Climate change will be most intensely perceived in the polar
regions, making temperatures soar even higher in the rest of the globe.
Zeke Hausfather, a researcher at Berkeley Earth, told
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/01/antarctic-temperatures-rise-10c-above-average-in-near-record-heatwave" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>The
Guardian</em></em></u></a> that the heat wave in Antarctica was one of
the main factors behind the scorching temperatures in the last few
weeks.
</p>
<h3>
Extreme weather sends China from drought to drowning
</h3>
<p>
Now major cities in China are also struggling under boiling heat.
<strong>Shanghai issued its first red warning alert — the most severe
temperature alert in the country — for the year last Thursday</strong>;
the next day, temperatures along the country’s eastern coast hit 104
degrees. On August 3, the city of Hangzhou faced a high of almost 107
degrees, breaking its previous record set in 2022. Warnings have also
been issued for the provinces of Fujian, Anhui, Jiangsu, among others,
and intense heat is expected to continue through this week.
</p>
<p>
In Henan province, which had been battling a severe drought after months
of no rain, the situation has taken a turn. In late July, the province
was hit by a brutal typhoon, leading to the evacuation of tens of
thousands.
</p>
<p>
This year, China recorded its hottest July in history.

Boston archbishop, ally of sex abuse victims, retires</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Rome — U.S. Cardinal Sean O’Malley, known for championing survivors
of sexual abuse and pushing the Catholic Church to reform, is stepping
down as the Archbishop of Boston, the Vatican announced Monday.   </p>
<p>The 80-year-old will be replaced by Richard Henning, the 59-year-old
bishop of Providence, to helm the fourth-largest diocese in the United
States, the Vatican said in a statement.   </p>
<p>It did not give a reason, saying only that Pope Francis had accepted
O’Malley’s resignation.   </p>
<p>In the Catholic Church, bishops who lead a diocese have a traditional
retirement age of 75, but the pope has the discretion to ask them to
stay on longer.   </p>
<p>For now, O’Malley remains head of the Pontifical Commission for the
Protection of Minors, a body created by Pope Francis to fight pedophilia
by priests that the bishop has led since 2014.  </p>
<p>O’Malley’s resignation ends a two-decade chapter leading Catholics in
the largely Irish and Italian city of Boston, where the global scandal
over child sex abuse by clergy erupted in 2002, the year before he
arrived.   </p>
<p>An ally of Francis, O’Malley is part of the Franciscan mendicant
order, Friars Minor Capuchin, and spent his early years as a priest
building bridges with the immigrant Hispanic community in the diocese of
Washington DC.   </p>
<p>Before arriving in Boston, O’Malley served as bishop of Saint Thomas,
a diocese covering all the US Virgin Islands, and later of Fall River,
Massachusetts, south of Boston.   </p>
<p>In Fall River and the diocese of Palm Beach, Florida, he managed the
fall-out of scandals involving the sexual abuse of minors by priests.
 </p>
<p>But it was in Boston where O’Malley came to prominence, managing what
was then the highest-profile US clerical sex abuse scandal, later
depicted in the Academy Award-winning film, “Spotlight.”    </p>
<p>Recognized for his rapport with victims and his speed in settling
cases, under O’Malley’s watch the archdiocese agreed to pay $85 million
to settle nearly 550 victim lawsuits.</p>

id="simone-biles-finishes-off-her-return-to-the-olympics-with-a-silver-on-floor-exercise">Simone
Biles finishes off her return to the Olympics with a silver on floor
exercise</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Paris — American gymnast Simone Biles didn’t get the golden sendoff
she hoped. </p>
<p>Biles earned silver in the floor exercise finals on Monday — her 11th
Olympic medal — after a routine that included a couple of costly steps
out of bounds. </p>
<p>Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade became the first gymnast to beat Biles in a
floor final in a major international competition, posting a score of
14.166 that finished just ahead of Biles at 14.133. </p>
<p>Jordan Chiles, a longtime friend of Biles, earned the bronze. </p>
<p>The 27-year-old Biles, considered the greatest in the history of the
sport, wasn’t at her usual best during a routine set to music from pop
icons Taylor Swift and Beyonce. </p>
<p>Still, she boosted her medal haul in Paris to four, gold in the team,
all-around and vault finals and a silver that came as a surprise in her
signature event. </p>
<p>Biles’ medal total (including seven gold, two silver, two bronze)
ties Czechoslovakia’s Vera Caslavska for the second-most by a female
gymnast in Olympic history. She missed a chance to add a fifth Paris
medal earlier Monday when she fell during the beam final, finishing
fifth. </p>
<p>Though she can make it look easy at times, it is not. She thudded to
the floor during her floor warm-up and had the balky left calf she
tweaked in qualifying re-wrapped before she competed. </p>
<p>Her tumbling passes weren’t perfect — she stepped out of bounds twice
— but her difficulty is usually so far above everyone else that it
hardly matters. </p>
<p>Not this time. She received a 7.833 execution score that included 0.6
in deductions for stepping out of bounds, allowing Andrade to win her
second Olympic gold. </p>
<p>Still, wearing a red-white-and-blue leotard featuring thousands of
crystals, Biles ended nine days of competition in Paris by silencing the
critics once and for all who have long derided her for pulling out of
multiple events at the Tokyo Games three years ago. </p>
<p>She won four medals in all, just one less than she did eight years
ago in Rio de Janeiro. </p>
<p>Chiles — the last competitor of the day — initially received a 13.666
from judges. After some delay, her total was boosted by 0.1 when she
filed an inquiry about her difficulty score, pushing Chiles past
Romanians Ana Barbosu and Sabrina Maneca-Voinea and into third.</p>

<h2 id="world-stocks-plunge-on-fears-of-us-economic-slowdown">World
stocks plunge on fears of US economic slowdown</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Stock markets across the globe plunged Monday as investors
sold stocks on worries that the U.S. economy, the world’s largest, might
be slowing and possibly headed to a recession. </p>
<p>In afternoon trading, all three major U.S. indexes — the Dow Jones
Industrial Average of 30 blue chip stocks, the broader S&amp;P 500 index
and the tech-heavy NASDAQ — were still down more than 2% after
sustaining even steeper declines earlier in the day. </p>
<p>In Europe, the Pan-European Stoxx 600 index fell 1.5%, rallying from
a larger dip earlier in the day, as every major market in Europe
declined. The FTSE 100, Britain’s benchmark index, dipped just over 2%,
its worst day since July 2023. </p>
<p>The sell-off started in Japan, with the Nikkei 225 index suffering
its largest single-day point drop in history, ending the day down a
staggering 12.4% — drawing comparisons to the “Black Monday” stock
market crash of 1987. Other Asian markets also fell. </p>
<p>Monday’s sell-off began last week after a monthly U.S. jobs report
showed significantly slower hiring, with 114,000 new jobs in July, far
fewer than had been forecasted and sharply down from recent months.
Unemployment rose to 4.3%, its highest level in nearly three years. </p>
<p>The two pieces of data spooked investors, deepening fears that the
U.S. economy could be sliding into a recession and that the Federal
Reserve may have waited too long to cut its benchmark rate. It has
delayed any rate cut until September, when the central bank’s policy
makers are expected to trim the key rate that sets the standard for
interest charges on many business and consumer loans. </p>
<p>The Fed last week held its benchmark rate at a two-decade high, where
it has remained for a year. </p>
<p>In a new assessment, the Goldman Sachs investment company said it now
expects the Federal Reserve to cut rates at its next three meetings — in
September, November and December. Goldman raised its forecast for the
probability of a U.S. recession in the next 12 months from 15% to
25%. </p>
<p>Because it encompasses 500 stocks, Standard &amp; Poor’s index is
often considered a key barometer of the U.S. economy. It has fallen
sharply in recent days, but it is still up about 9% percent for the
year. At its peak in mid-July, it was up 19%.</p>
<p>Trading in Japan was suspended to prevent panic selling after the
decline triggered circuit breakers designed to contain severe market
drops. The frenzy also activated circuit breakers in South Korea, where
the main market finished nearly 9% lower. </p>
<p>In Taiwan, stocks plunged more than 8% — the worst single-day
percentage drop in the island’s history. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company — the world’s largest chipmaker — fell nearly
10%. </p>
<p>Aside from fears about the U.S. economy, geopolitical tensions
frequently draw concerns for investors, too, including last week’s
assassination in Iran of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’ top political leader.
Iran has blamed Israel for the attack, and vowed retaliation, raising
fears of a regional war. </p>
<p>The market plunge has been most severe in Japan, which analysts said
was experiencing a market correction after many investors relied on a
historically cheap yen and rock-bottom interest rates to fund risky
investments. That strategy was exposed after Japan last week raised
benchmark interest rates for only the second time in 17 years and hinted
that such rate hikes may continue. </p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s a civilization-altering crash,” said Khoon Goh,
head of Asia research at ANZ. “It’s just to me a simple case of market
participants getting way ahead and, I guess you can argue, greedy, in
over-leveraging, thinking that cheap and free money in Japan was going
to be here to stay. And that has gone badly wrong, and they are having
to very quickly unwind it and it’s having knock-on effects into asset
markets.”   </p>
<p>In an interview with VOA, Goh downplayed concerns about a U.S.
recession. </p>
<p>“I think it’s a little bit unfair to blame the (U.S.) Fed for being
late or behind the curve, because until recently a lot of people were
thinking that the U.S. economy was still in reasonably good shape. And
no one was really ringing the recession alarm bells,” he said.    </p>
<p>Two years ago, the Fed started increasing borrowing costs to curb
inflation, which had caused prices to soar for essentials like rent and
food. Since then, it has aimed for a “soft landing,” seeking to control
inflation without causing an economic recession. </p>
<p>In a commentary published Monday, BMI – A Fitch Solutions Company,
said, “The Fed has significant fire power and can cut rates quite
aggressively to support growth if needed.” </p>
<p>BMI said that while global markets have been more volatile than
expected, they had recently rallied sharply and were vulnerable to a
sell-off.  </p>
<p>“Corrections of 5-10% are fairly common during bull markets and
typically, there is a seasonal pick up in equity volatility during the
July-October period,” it added.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
With all the attention paid to electric vehicles and heat pumps, the
2020s might seem like the decade of home electrification — but nothing
might ever rival the boom of the original Roaring Twenties. By 1929, 70%
of all American homes had access to electricity,
<a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/the-birth-of-the-grid" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>double
the figure</u></a> from the beginning of the decade – bringing home
electrification from minority to majority.
</p>
<p>
Home electrification was so big back then, it even had a mascot: Reddy
Kilowatt. Invented by a marketer at the Alabama Power Company in 1926,
this cheery spokescharacter with a lightning-bolt body and a lightbulb
nose was licensed to hundreds of utility companies throughout the
greater part of the 20th century to promote electricity – and more
specifically investor–owned utilities. Reddy was even used as a tool to
<a href="https://sirismm.si.edu/EADpdfs/NMAH.AC.0913.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>link
government-owned utilities to socialism</u></a> or communism in years
following World War II.

I first came across Reddy Kilowatt last year when a climate tech peer
emailed me an image of him, probably from the 1950s, powering everything
from a hot water heater to a record player with the headline “Your
<em><em>all</em></em> Electric Home.”
</p>

</p>
<p>
For weeks I couldn’t stop thinking about that headline because I kept
hearing people in the decarbonization movement say similar things (does
<em><em>Electrify Everything</em></em> ring a bell?). Itching to learn
more of the history of Reddy, I reached out to an expert.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirsten_Moana_Thompson" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Dr. Kirsten
Moana Thompson</u></a> is a professor at Seattle University who teaches
and writes about animation. Her
<a href="https://www.academia.edu/42902661/Live_Electrically_with_Reddy_Kilowatt_Your_Electrical_Servant" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>paper</u></a>,
<em><em>Live Electrically with Reddy Kilowatt, Your Electrical
Servant</em></em>, explores the history of this “phenomenally successful
and ubiquitous spokescharacter.”
</p>
<p>
I chatted with Dr. Moana Thompson over a video call from her office
where a framed illustration of Reddy Kilowatt hung behind her. I went
into the call thinking about positioning this article, “Is America ready
for another Reddy?,” but by the end I learned he may be best left in the
1900s. The following interview was edited for length and clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mike Munsell</strong>
</p>
<p>
Can you introduce yourself and tell me how you ended up researching
Reddy Kilowatt?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dr. Kirsten Moana Thompson:</strong>
</p>
<p>
I’m a professor and chair of the film and media department at Seattle
University, and Reddy Kilowatt was part of my research into animation
that has been used in sponsored media — that is media used for
non-traditional, non-entertainment purposes to do something else, like
sell something, instruct you, persuade you. It forms a chapter in what
will be a new book coming out in the next couple of years on animation
and advertising. I think Reddy Kilowatt is a great example of how
popular it was in the post-war period to use animated spokescharacters
to sell products or ideas.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Munsell:</strong>
</p>
<p>
I’m curious: Are animated mascots less prevalent today than back in the
post-war period?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Thompson:</strong>
</p>
<p>
My research doesn’t focus on the contemporary era, so I couldn’t give
you a precise example. But certainly, as late as the ’70s, animation
characters still were extensively used to promote products, not just
cereal, and toys, but things like bubble bath and candy and, well into
the ’70s, alcohol as well.
</p>
<p>
There are lots of reasons for that, because certain types of animation
were fairly cheap to produce, were appealing, often comedic, and
attention grabbing. They were a great means to sell a product — also
great to use for abstract or more complex processes, like, how do you
make oil or petrol or gas? How do you convey a concept like capitalism?
Animation, as opposed to live action, was often a more successful way to
convey or target topics of that nature.
</p>
<p>
We have to anthropomorphize the things that are too abstract, too
conceptual, or too inhuman to make them translatable into something that
we can comprehend and relate to. Hence the Geico lizard or the Aflac
duck.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Munsell </strong>
</p>
<p>
And that makes sense then for Reddy Kilowatt to advertise electricity
back when it was new, right?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Thompson</strong>
</p>
<p>
Yes, it really emerged around the time electrification was in two thirds
of American households — by 1930. And electrical utility companies
needed to find an appealing way to sell their product and to encourage
consumer consumption of things like appliances, which themselves were
emerging — things like dishwashers and washing machines and hair dryers
and so on. But also rural electrification, and electrification for
business purposes and factories, and on farms.
</p>
<p>
[Reddy Kilowatt] emerged targeting a fairly affluent consumer, by, for
example, turning electricity into a servant – an abstract servant that
was personalized and anthropomorphized.
</p>
<p>
But it was also a way of rather cleverly justifying rate increases as
well, which occurred a little later, by making Reddy Kilowatt literally
a figure that earns wages and was regarded as an employee by many
electrical utility companies. So it’s a clever way to say to people,
<em><em>hey, everybody deserves a wage and Reddy Kilowatt deserves a
wage and prices are going up, so we’re going to put his wages up. And
that’s a fair thing</em></em>.

<p>
<strong>Munsell:</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Smithsonian has a huge collection of Reddy Kilowatt material. Did
you get to go check that out?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Thompson: </strong>
</p>
<p>
Yes, I did. The archives are extensive. And so you can read all about
how [Reddy Kilowatt creator] Ashton Collins promoted the product, and
what the kinds of speeches that he gave to many other business companies
and electrical utility companies in the 30s and 40s.
</p>
<p>
But he’s part of a wider movement. There are other leading figures like
Walt Disney and Walter Lantz, who were animation studio heads. Walter
Lantz, of course, ran what he would pick the Walter Lantz studios that
produced Woody Woodpecker and Andy Panda, and a number of other popular
cartoons of the 40s. And Walt Disney, of course, we’re all familiar
with. But they all believed that the kinds of skills that animation
studios were doing in the 1940s — by making cartoons to train troops to
operate machinery or rifles, and by making propaganda to translate the
values of the fight for democracy against fascism — they believed that
those skills could be applied to the commercial market in the post-war
period. And that animation was a key element of visual culture that
could translate to a sometimes illiterate population or partially
illiterate population.
</p>
<p>
So Ashton Collins is not alone there. He’s part of a broader movement in
the film industry and in the animation industry, to understand the
unique power of animation to communicate and to sell and persuade.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Munsell</strong>
</p>
<p>
Did you find anything in your research particularly surprising?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Thompson</strong>
</p>
<p>
In addition to extensive print materials in the Smithsonian, you see
dozens and dozens of objects that featured Reddy Kilowatt. His image is
on everything from stickers to comic books to toys, and other giveaways
for kids to little marionettes, and robots, which were used in trade
shows and trade fairs. [Author’s note: eBay has an
<a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2332490.m570.l1313&_nkw=reddy+kilowatt&_sacat=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>extensive
Reddy Kilowatt collection</u></a>]
</p>
<p>
It was used in the 1939 World’s Fair, for example, to communicate and to
encourage the public to interact with Reddy Kilowatt as if it was a real
figure. I was quite taken with this – it’s really an early form of
animatronics. They were using an avatar, a spokescharacter, who was
fairly ubiquitous in the American home, on people’s electricity bills,
and combining it with a large three dimensional object with a record
player attached and somebody who operated the speaking, to interact with
kids at fairs and to communicate basic ideas. So that was really
exciting in a way because it shows how ahead of its time Ashton Collins
was at understanding interactivity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mike Munsell</strong>
</p>
<p>
I was thinking about copyright and trademark law and the public domain.
Reddy Kilowatt was, in his original form, created in 1926. We’re coming
up on that 100 year mark. Is there a chance he enters the public domain?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dr. Moana Thompson</strong>
</p>
<p>
I’m not sure about that. Because you can renew copyright. Which of
course Disney did repeatedly before it finally had to succumb to the end
of copyright. And Reddy is also a trademark as opposed to a copyrighted
image. So he has not just appeared in what is public access now, some of
his films and TV commercials, but he’s also a trademark figure that has
a continuing commercial currency. And Ashton Collins was absolutely
rigorous at paying attention to trademark law. He sued other companies
that had similar characters,

<p>
I suspect that Xcel Energy [who now owns the rights to Reddy Kilowatt]
is going to be very strict in policing its trademarks. Because if this
product has value as a commodity of nostalgia for a certain generation,
or multiple generations, or even if it has a new function in Xcel’s
future corporate identity, he’s going to have value.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Munsell</strong>
</p>
<p>
I guess your research sort of doesn’t get quite into the present day,
but for my understanding Reddy Kilowatt is not really used much today.
It was used by a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOVffAeAmII" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>utility
in Barbados</u></a> and an Ecuadorian
<a href="https://x.com/CSEmelec/status/1553379897229410304" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>soccer
club</u></a> more recently, but from your understanding do you know why
he stopped being used?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Thompson</strong><br/>
</p>
<p>
Well, I’m not sure that he stopped being used. I have seen the return of
Reddy Kilowatt as a consumer figure and as a licensed product that
appears on T-shirts and stickers. Amazon has been selling quite a lot of
Reddy Kilowatt products. So it’s possible that Xcel Energy that owns the
trademark sees the value of the product for a new market, which is the
nostalgic market, where you can sell a cartoon character itself.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Munsell: </strong>I do think that with the emergence of heat
pumps, and induction stoves, there is a push toward home electrification
and moving away from fossil fuels in your home. I wonder if that’s an
opportunity for a reemergence of Reddy?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Thompson</strong>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, it could be an opportunity for them to repurpose the trademark.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Munsell</strong><br/>
</p>
<p>
Is there anything else you wanted to add about your research into Reddy?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Thompson</strong>
</p>
<p>
I thought it was interesting, the blend that Reddy Kilowatt had of both
the impersonal and the personal. On the one hand, we’ve mostly been
talking about it as this cute cartoony character of appeal and
personality. But on the other hand, he represents an abstract concept,
which is almost robotic. He was literally a robot as part of his
marketing. This concept of the kilowatt as one and a half horsepower was
part of this wider discursive emergence in the ’20s that electricity was
both a servant, as an anthropomorphized figure, and an abstraction that
is there at the flick of a switch.
</p>
<p>
And in their marketing, they used imagery that of course would never be
used today. The association of kilowatt as both a
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolie" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>coolie</u></a>”
– which was the specific language used – and a slave.
</p>
<p>
So this kind of racist imagery is interesting because it gets to the
roots of this idea of the dehumanized, depersonalized aspects of Reddy
Kilowatt – that electricity represented by using this imagery, and they
had little pictures of kilowatt, which were described as a slave or a
“coolie” to explain that, basically, this was free labor and unlimited
labor. So obviously addressed to an implicitly white consumer. [The idea
that] racial imagery of course affected all kinds of aspects of American
advertising is well known to scholars in this field and often played on
imagery of blackness or whiteness, in the case of soap advertising, for
example, but Reddy Kilowatt in particular is this machinic identity.
</p>
<p>
And who knows, maybe that’ll come back again in the future, because
machines are so much more part of our lives now, as compared to 1926 or
the mid century with computers and artificial intelligence.

<p>When a robotic rover lands on another world, scientists have a
limited amount of time to collect data from the troves of explorable
material, because of short mission durations and the length of time to
complete complex experiments. That’s why researchers at NASA’s Goddard
Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, are investigating the use of

landfall</a> in Florida’s Big Bend region this morning as a category 1
storm. It is expected to be extremely dangerous, not necessarily because
of its wind speeds but because of the water it will dump over
southeastern states in the coming days. Forecasters are warning of
life-threatening storm surge, severe flash flooding, as well as strong
winds. Up to 18 inches of rain could fall along the coast throughout the
week, from Georgia through the Carolinas. If the storm stalls after it
hits land, it is likely to strengthen and drop even more rain. Debby is
the fourth named storm of the season and is making landfall in the same
region Hurricane Idalia hit a year ago. Scientists agree climate change
is heating the oceans, which is making tropical storms wetter and
stronger.

contenders, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Minnesota Gov. Tim
Walz, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. Here’s a
look at their climate track records:

<strong>Shapiro</strong> – He has proposed a

program to cut state emissions and lower electricity bills. He secured a
$369 million federal grant to cut industrial emissions and create 6,000
jobs. Environmentalists aren’t jazzed about his murky history on
fracking. As state attorney general, he investigated the gas drilling
industry on fracking dangers, but as governor, “he’s become more
friendly to drilling,” wrote Mike Soraghan at
<em><em>Politico</em></em>. Harris might see that as a good thing,
though, as Donald Trump tries to target her for being anti-fracking.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Walz </strong>– With a keen understanding of what it will take
to get Americans on board with climate policies, Walz is “one of the
country’s most skillful climate communicators,”

That said, he has helped quietly push for investment in renewable energy

<strong>Kelly</strong> – Representing one of the hottest states in the
country, the former astronaut has been vocal about the effects of
climate change. He pushed to get the final Inflation Reduction Act to
include $4 billion from drought mitigation and cosponsored legislation
to allow incentives for farmers that deploy carbon-storing agricultural
practices. He has “frequently crossed the aisle to work on environment
and mining legislation and is well-versed in ongoing disputes over the
Western United States’ historic drought,” wrote Timothy Cama at

explained</a>, the country has so far measured its emissions against
gross domestic product. “That approach has allowed China to tout
environmental successes even as its total emissions soared, so long as
they didn’t grow faster than the overall economy.” Under a new five-year
plan that begins in 2026, the country will start to target overall
emissions volumes and these will become the main measure after the
country’s emissions peak, which could happen in 2030 or sooner.

department of geophysical sciences and a longtime proponent of solar
geoengineering. Keith makes his case for the contentious and still
experimental idea of spraying sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere to
lower global temperatures. He admits the process comes with risks, but
says these are “quantitatively small compared to the benefits.” Yes, the
practice could make twilight look different (more orange), but daylight
would otherwise probably look the same.
</p>
<p>
The article quotes Frank Keutsch, one of Keith’s collaborators on a
previous project, who compared solar geoengineering to opiates: “They
only treat the symptom and not the actual cause,” Keutsch said. “You can
get addicted to it if you don’t actually address the cause. In addition,
like any painkiller, you’re going to have side effects. And then there
are withdrawal symptoms, and that’s termination shock.”

<h2 id="freebsd-as-a-daily-driver">FreeBSD as a daily driver</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Not too long ago I linked to a blog post by long-time OSNews reader
(and silver Patreon) and friend of mine Morgan, about how to set up
OpenBSD as a workstation operating system – and in fact, I personally
used that guide in my own OpenBSD journey. Well, Morgan’s back with
another, similar article, this time covering FreeBSD. After going
through the basic steps needed to make FreeBSD a bit more amenable to
desktop use, Morgan notes about performance: Now let’s compare FreeBSD.
Well, quite frankly, there is no comparison! FreeBSD just feels snappier
and more responsive on the desktop; at the same 170Hz refresh it
actually feels like 170Hz. Void Linux always felt fast enough and I
thought it had no lag at all at that refresh rate, but comparing them
side by side (FreeBSD installed on the NVMe drive, Void running from a
USB 4 SSD with similar performance), FreeBSD is smooth as glass and I
started noticing just the slightest lag/stutter on Void. The same holds
true for Firefox; I use smooth scrolling and on FreeBSD it really is
perfectly smooth. Similarly, Youtube performance is unreal, with no
dropped frames at any resolution all the way up to 4Kp60, and the videos
look so much smoother! ↫ Morgan/kaidenshi This is especially relevant
for me personally, since the prime reason I switched my workstation back
to Fedora KDE was OpenBSD’s performance issues. While those performance
issues were entirely expected and the result of the operating system’s
focus on security and hardening, it did mean it’s just not suitable for
me as a workstation operating system, even if I like the internals and
find it a joy to use, even under the hood. If FreeBSD delivers more
solid desktop and workstation performance, it might be time I set up a
FreeBSD KDE installation and see if it can handle my workstation’s 270Hz
4K display. As I keep reiterating – the BSD world has a lot to offer
those wishing to run a UNIX-like workstation operating system, and it’s
articles like these that help people get started. A lot of the steps
taken may seem elementary to many of us, but for people coming from
Linux or even Windows, they may be unfamiliar and daunting, so having it
all laid out in a straightforward manner is quite helpful.</p>

id="hurricane-debby-to-bring-heavy-rain-catastrophic-flooding-to-florida-georgia-s.-carolina">Hurricane
Debby to bring heavy rain, catastrophic flooding to Florida, Georgia, S.
Carolina</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TAMPA, FLORIDA — The center of Hurricane Debby is expected to reach
the Big Bend coast of Florida early Monday bringing potential
record-setting rains, catastrophic flooding and life-threatening storm
surge as it moves slowly across the northern part of the state before
stalling over the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina.</p>
<p>Debby was located about 40 miles (70 kilometers) west of Cedar Key,
Florida, with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 kph). The storm was
moving north at 12 mph (19 kph), the National Hurricane Center in Miami
said early Monday.</p>
<p>Debby is the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season
after Tropical Storm Alberto, Hurricane Beryl and Tropical Storm Chris,
all of which formed in June.</p>
<p>Forecasters warned heavy amounts of rain from Debby could spawn
catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia.</p>
<p>The storm was expected to make landfall around midday Monday in the
Big Bend area of Florida, north of Tampa, the hurricane center said. A
tornado watch also was in effect for parts of Florida and Georgia until
6 a.m. Monday.</p>
<p>“Right now, we are trying secure everything from floating away,” said
Sheryl Horne, whose family owns the Shell Island Fish Camp along the
Wakulla River in St. Marks, Florida, where some customers moved their
boats inland. The sparsely populated Big Bend region in the Florida
Panhandle was hit last year by Hurricane Idalia, which made landfall as
a Category 3 hurricane.</p>
<p>“I am used to storms and I’m used to cleaning up after storms,” Horne
said.</p>
<p>Debby was expected to move eastward over northern Florida and then
stall over the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina, thrashing
the region with potential record-setting rains totaling up to 76
centimeter) beginning Tuesday. Officials also warned of life-threatening
storm surge along Florida’s Gulf Coast, with 1.8 to 3 meters of
inundation expected Monday between the Ochlockonee and Suwannee
rivers.</p>
<p>“There’s some really amazing rainfall totals being forecast and
amazing in a bad way,” Michael Brennan, director of the hurricane
center, said at a briefing. “That would be record-breaking rainfall
associated with a tropical cyclone for both the states of Georgia and
South Carolina if we got up to the 30-inch level.”</p>
<p>Flooding impacts could last through Friday and are expected to be
especially severe in low-lying areas near the coast, including Savannah,
Georgia; Hilton Head, South Carolina; and Charleston, South Carolina.
North Carolina officials were monitoring the storm’s progress.</p>
<p>Officials in Savannah said the area could see a month’s worth of rain
in four days if the system stalls over the region.</p>
<p>“This is going to a significant storm. The word historic cannot be
underscored here,” Savannah Mayor Van. R. Johnson said during a press
conference.</p>
<p>The hurricane center said at 11 p.m. that Debby was located about 161
kilometers west of Tampa, Florida, with maximum sustained winds of 120
kph. The storm was moving north at 19 kph.</p>
<p>Debby’s outer bands grazed the west coast of Florida, flooding
streets and bringing power outages. Sarasota County officials said most
roadways on Siesta Key, a barrier island off the coast of Sarasota, were
under water. The hurricane center had predicted the system would
strengthen as it curved off the southwest Florida coast, where the water
has been extremely warm.</p>
<p>At a briefing Sunday afternoon, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned the
storm could lead to “really, really significant flooding that will
happen in North Central Florida.”</p>
<p>The storm would follow a similar track to Hurricane Idalia but would
“be much wetter. We are going to see much more inundation,” he said.</p>
<p>A hurricane warning was issued for parts of the Big Bend and Florida
Panhandle areas, while tropical storm warnings were posted for Florida’s
West Coast, the southern Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas. A tropical storm
watch extended farther west into the Panhandle.</p>
<p>Tropical storms and hurricanes can trigger river flooding and
overwhelm drainage systems and canals. Forecasters warned of 15
centimeters to 30 centimeters of rain and up to 46 centimeters in
isolated areas of Florida.</p>
<p>Storm surge expected to hit Gulf Coast, including Tampa Bay</p>
<p>Flat Florida is prone to flooding even on sunny days and the storm
was predicted to bring a surge of 0.6 to 1.2 meters along most of the
Gulf Coast, including Tampa Bay, with a storm tide of up to 2.1 meters
north of there in the Big Bend region.</p>
<p>Forecasters warned of “a danger of life-threatening storm surge
inundation” in a region that includes Hernando Beach, Crystal River,
Steinhatchee and Cedar Key. Officials in Citrus and Levy counties
ordered a mandatory evacuation of coastal areas, while those in
Hernando, Manatee, Pasco and Taylor counties called for voluntary
evacuations. Shelters opened in those and some other counties.</p>
<p>Citrus County Sheriff Mike Prendergast estimated 21,000 people live
in his county’s evacuation zone.</p>
<p>Residents, businesses prepare for flooding</p>
<p>Residents in Steinhatchee, Florida, which flooded during Hurricane
Idalia, spent Sunday moving items to higher ground.</p>
<p>“I’ve been here 29 years. This isn’t the first time I’ve done it. Do
you get used to it? No,” Mark Reblin said as he moved items out of the
liquor store he owns.</p>
<p>Employees of Savannah Canoe and Kayak in Georgia said they were busy
tying down their watercraft, laying sandbags, and raising equipment off
the ground. Mayme Bouy, the store manager, said she wasn’t too concerned
about the forecast calling for a potential historic rain event.</p>
<p>“But we do have some high tides this week so if the rain is happening
around then, that could be bad,” Bouy added. “I’d rather play it safe
than sorry.”</p>
<p>Governors declare emergencies ahead of landfall</p>
<p>DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida’s 67
counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members.
Utility crews from in and out of state were ready to restore power after
the storm, he said in a post on X. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and South
Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster made their own emergency declarations.</p>
<p>In Tampa alone, officials gave out more than 30,000 sandbags to
barricade against flooding.</p>
<p>“We’ve got our stormwater drains cleared out. We’ve got our
generators all checked and full. We’re doing everything that we need to
be prepared to face a tropical storm,” Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said.</p>
<p>Northeast coast also preparing for storm conditions</p>
<p>Emergency managers in New England and New York were already
monitoring the path of the storm for the possibility of remnants
striking their states. States including New York and Vermont have been
hit by heavy rain and thunderstorms in recent weeks and were still
coping with flooding and saturated ground.</p>

weather helps firefighters corral a third of big California blaze</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHICO, California — Fire crews battling California’s largest wildfire
this year have corralled a third of the blaze aided in part by cooler
weather, but a return of triple-digit temperatures could allow it to
grow, fire officials said Sunday.</p>
<p>Cooler temperatures and increased humidity gave firefighters “a great
opportunity to make some good advances” on the fire in the Sierra Nevada
foothills, said Chris Vestal, a spokesman for the California Department
of Forestry and Fire Protection.</p>
<p>The Park Fire has scorched 1,623 square kilometers since igniting
July 24 when authorities said a man pushed a burning car into a gully in
Chico and then fled. The blaze was 30% contained as of Sunday.</p>
<p>The massive fire has scorched an area bigger than the city of Los
Angeles, which covers about 1,302 square kilometers. It continues to
burn through rugged, inaccessible, and steep terrain with dense
vegetation.</p>
<p>The fire’s push northward has brought it toward the rugged lava rock
landscape surrounding Lassen Volcanic National Park, which has been
closed because of the threat. The inhospitable terrain remains one of
the biggest challenges for firefighters.</p>
<p>“The challenge with that is we can’t use our heavy machinery like
bulldozers to go through and cut a line right through it,” Vestal
said.</p>
<p>“On top of that, we have to put human beings, our hand crews, in to
remove those fuels and some of that terrain is not really the greatest
for people that are hiking so it takes a long time and extremely hard
work,” he added.</p>
<p>The fire has destroyed at least 572 structures and damaged 52 others.
At least 2,700 people in Butte and Tehama Counties remain under
evacuation orders, Veal said.</p>
<p>After days of smoky skies, clear skies Sunday allowed firefighters to
deploy helicopters and other aircraft to aid in the fight against the
blaze as temperatures reached above 38 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>“The fire is in a good place from the weather conditions we had the
last couple of days but we still have to worry about the weather that we
have and the conditions that are going to be present now for about the
next five or six days,” Veal said.</p>
<p>The fire in Northern California is one of 85 large blazes burning
across the West.</p>
<p>In Colorado, firefighters were making progress Sunday against three
major fires burning near heavily populated areas north and south of
Denver. Many residents evacuated by the fires have been allowed to go
back home.</p>
<p>The Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office is investigating a blaze
threatening hundreds of homes near the Colorado city of Littleton as
arson.</p>
<p>About 50 structures were damaged or destroyed, about half of them
homes, by a fire near Loveland. And one person was found dead in a home
burned by a fire west of the town of Lyons.</p>
<p>Scientists say extreme wildfires are becoming more common and
destructive in the U.S. West and other parts of the world as climate
change warms the planet and droughts become more severe.</p>
<p>In Canada, a 24-year-old firefighter battling a blaze in Jasper
National Park was killed Saturday by a falling tree, the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police said.</p>
<p>The firefighter from Calgary, whose name was not released, was
battling a fire north of Jasper, a town in Alberta Province that was
half destroyed last month by a fast-moving fire.</p>

id="us-expected-to-propose-barring-chinese-software-in-autonomous-vehicles">US
expected to propose barring Chinese software in autonomous vehicles</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Commerce Department is expected to propose
barring Chinese software in autonomous and connected vehicles in the
coming weeks, according to sources briefed on the matter.</p>
<p>The Biden administration plans to issue a proposed rule that would
bar Chinese software in vehicles in the United States with Level 3
automation and above, which would have the effect of also banning
testing on U.S. roads of autonomous vehicles produced by Chinese
companies.</p>
<p>The administration, in a previously unreported decision, also plans
to propose barring vehicles with Chinese-developed advanced wireless
communications abilities modules from U.S. roads, the sources added.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, automakers and suppliers would need to verify
that none of their connected vehicle or advanced autonomous vehicle
software was developed in a “foreign entity of concern” like China, the
sources said.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department said last month it planned to issue proposed
rules on connected vehicles in August and expected to impose limits on
some software made in China and other countries deemed adversaries.</p>
<p>Asked for comment, a Commerce Department spokesperson said on Sunday
that the department “is concerned about the national security risks
associated with connected technologies in connected vehicles.”</p>
<p>The department’s Bureau of Industry and Security will issue a
proposed rule that “will focus on specific systems of concern within the
vehicle. Industry will also have a chance to review that proposed rule
and submit comments.”</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately comment but the
Chinese foreign ministry has previously urged the United States “to
respect the laws of the market economy and principles of fair
competition.” It argues Chinese cars are popular globally because they
had emerged out of fierce market competition and are technologically
innovative.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the White House and State Department hosted a meeting
with allies and industry leaders to “jointly address the national
security risks associated with connected vehicles,” the department said.
Sources said officials disclosed details of the administration’s planned
rule.</p>
<p>The meeting included officials from the United States, Australia,
Canada, the European Union, Germany, India, Japan, the Republic of
Korea, Spain, and the United Kingdom who “exchanged views on the data
and cybersecurity risks associated with connected vehicles and certain
components.”</p>
<p>Also known as conditional driving automation, Level 3 involves
technology that allows drivers to engage in activities behind the wheel,
such as watching movies or using smartphones, but only under some
limited conditions.</p>
<p>In November, a group of U.S. lawmakers raised alarm about Chinese
companies collecting and handling sensitive data while testing
autonomous vehicles in the United States and asked questions of 10 major
companies including Baidu, Nio, WeRide, Didi Chuxing, Xpeng, Inceptio,
Pony.ai, AutoX, Deeproute.ai and Qcraft.</p>
<p>The letters said in the 12 months ended November 2022 that Chinese AV
companies test drove more than 450,000 miles in California. In July
2023, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said his department had
national security concerns about Chinese autonomous vehicle companies in
the United States.</p>
<p>The administration is worried about connected vehicles using the
driver monitoring system to listen or record occupants or take control
of the vehicle itself.</p>
<p>“The national security risks are quite significant,” Commerce
Secretary Gina Raimondo said in May. “We decided to take action because
this is really serious stuff.”</p>
