<p>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/releases/tag/0.20">LLM
0.20</a></strong>
</p>
New release of my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> CLI tool
and Python library. A bunch of accumulated fixes and features since the
start of December, most notably:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Support for OpenAI’s
<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#o1">o1 model</a> - a
significant upgrade from <code>o1-preview</code> given its 200,000 input
and 100,000 output tokens (<code>o1-preview</code> was 128,000/32,768).
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/676">#676</a>
</li>
<li>
Support for the <code>gpt-4o-audio-preview</code> and
<code>gpt-4o-mini-audio-preview</code> models, which can accept audio
input: <code>llm -m gpt-4o-audio-preview -a
https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/pelican-joke-request.mp3</code>
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/677">#677</a>
</li>
<li>
A new <code>llm -x/–extract</code> option which extracts and returns the
contents of the first fenced code block in the response. This is useful
for prompts that generate code.
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/681">#681</a>
</li>
<li>
A new <code>llm models -q ‘search’</code> option for searching available
models - useful if you’ve installed a lot of plugins. Searches are case
insensitive. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/700">#700</a>

Inference-Time Compute for Adversarial Robustness</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-22, updated: 2025-01-22, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://openai.com/index/trading-inference-time-compute-for-adversarial-robustness/">Trading
Inference-Time Compute for Adversarial Robustness</a></strong>
</p>
Brand new research paper from OpenAI, exploring how inference-scaling
“reasoning” models such as o1 might impact the search for improved
security with respect to things like prompt injection.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We conduct experiments on the impact of increasing inference-time
compute in reasoning models (specifically OpenAI <code>o1-preview</code>
and <code>o1-mini</code>) on their robustness to adversarial attacks. We
find that across a variety of attacks, increased inference-time compute
leads to improved robustness. In many cases (with important exceptions),
the fraction of model samples where the attack succeeds tends to zero as
the amount of test-time compute grows.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
They clearly understand why this stuff is such a big problem, especially
as we try to outsource more autonomous actions to “agentic models”:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Ensuring that agentic models function reliably when browsing the web,
sending emails, or uploading code to repositories can be seen as
analogous to ensuring that self-driving cars drive without accidents. As
in the case of self-driving cars, an agent forwarding a wrong email or
creating security vulnerabilities may well have far-reaching real-world
consequences. Moreover, LLM agents face an additional challenge from
adversaries which are rarely present in the self-driving case.
Adversarial entities could control some of the inputs that these agents
encounter while browsing the web, or reading files and images.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is a really interesting paper, but it starts with a <em>huge</em>
caveat. The original sin of LLMs - and the reason
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/prompt-injection/">prompt
injection</a> is such a hard problem to solve - is the way they mix
instructions and input data in the same stream of tokens. I’ll quote
section 1.2 of the paper in full - note that point 1 describes that
challenge:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>1.2 Limitations of this work</strong>
</p>
<p>
The following conditions are necessary to ensure the models respond more
safely, even in adversarial settings:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Ability by the model to parse its context into separate components. This
is crucial to be able to distinguish data from instructions, and
instructions at different hierarchies.
</li>
<li>
Existence of safety specifications that delineate what contents should
be allowed or disallowed, how the model should resolve conflicts, etc..
</li>
<li>
Knowledge of the safety specifications by the model (e.g. in context,
memorization of their text, or ability to label prompts and responses
according to them).
</li>
<li>
Ability to apply the safety specifications to specific instances. For
the adversarial setting, the crucial aspect is the ability of the model
to apply the safety specifications to instances that are <em>out of the
training distribution</em>, since naturally these would be the prompts
provided by the adversary,
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
They then go on to say (emphasis mine):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Our work demonstrates that inference-time compute helps with Item 4,
even in cases where the instance is shifted by an adversary to be far
from the training distribution (e.g., by injecting soft tokens or
adversarially generated content). <strong>However, our work does not
pertain to Items 1-3, and even for 4, we do not yet provide a
“foolproof” and complete solution</strong>.
</p>
<p>
While we believe this work provides an important insight, we note that
fully resolving the adversarial robustness challenge will require
tackling all the points above.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So while this paper demonstrates that inference-scaled models can
greatly improve things with respect to identifying and avoiding
out-of-distribution attacks against safety instructions, they are
<em>not</em> claiming a solution to the key instruction-mixing challenge
of prompt injection. Once again, this is not the silver bullet we are
all dreaming of.
</p>
<p>
The paper introduces two new categories of attack against
inference-scaling models, with two delightful names: “Think Less” and
“Nerd Sniping”.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Think Less</strong> attacks are when an attacker tricks a model
into spending less time on reasoning, on the basis that more reasoning
helps prevent a variety of attacks so cutting short the reasoning might
help an attack make it through.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Nerd Sniping</strong> (see <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">XKCD
356</a>) does the opposite: these are attacks that cause the model to
“spend inference-time compute unproductively”. In addition to added
costs, these could also open up some security holes - there are
edge-cases where attack success rates go up for longer compute times.
</p>
<p>
<p>Sadly they didn’t provide concrete examples for either of these new
attack classes. I’d love to see what Nerd Sniping looks like in a
malicious prompt!</p>

How You Normalize Performing a Fascist Gesture</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-22, from: McSweeney’s Internet Tendency</p>
<p>
<i>“There were angry reactions across Europe to Elon Musk’s apparent use
of a salute banned for its Nazi links in Germany, where some condemned
it as malicious provocation or an outreach of solidarity to far-right
groups.” —

Guardian</a></i>
</p>
<div class="break">
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li>-
</div>
<p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Have the wealthiest man on Earth (ideally someone who has gone out
of his way, perhaps on a social media platform that he purchased, to
lend credibility to even the most shocking hate speech) “accidentally”
perform the gesture on stage at a victory rally for the fascist autocrat
that he spent hundreds of millions of dollars to elect.
</p>
<p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Put out a press release claiming that the gesture was accidental, or
an unrelated and totally benign gesture, or can be attributed to his
“well-known neurological condition.” Also, isn’t criticizing him—a
person with a condition they can’t control—for this accidental gesture a
little ableist?
</p>
<p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Have your trusted media pundits ask how anyone could even for a
moment think the rich man would do this intentionally, knowing as he
does full well the long and tragic history of the gesture. “Did you know
the rich man visited Auschwitz last year? He can’t be a fascist!”
</p>
<p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>If the rich man once spent his days seeking the approval of a group
known for being anti-gesture, point out his very public evolution into
someone who sees the anti-gesture group for who they really are: people
who harbor evil beliefs because they suffer from a mind virus.
</p>
<p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Encourage the rich man’s ardent fans to suggest that those
crucifying this poor rich man are the ones who embody the original
meaning of the gesture, that they are the real fascists.
</p>
<p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Put out another press release:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“In light of this vitriol from the so-called tolerant end of the
political spectrum about the alleged vileness of the gesture, could it
not be said that those who so long condemned it, a mere gesture if we’re
being honest, had perhaps, in doing so, become the very thing (i.e.,
hateful bigots) they vowed to eradicate? Isn’t that a bit ironic? Don’t
you think?”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Have confidence that your dog whistle has been heard by those it was
meant to signal to. What is it signaling? That you <span
class="caps">WANT</span> to perform the gesture. Performing the gesture
is what you’ve wanted all along. And now that the pro-gesture crowd has
again assumed power, perhaps the time is finally right to resume
performing the gesture.
</p>
<p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>Sit back and wait because this next part is out of your hands. But
it’s a safe bet that it will happen—and it will indeed happen. Soon,
those rushing to the rich man’s defense will start performing the
gesture ironically.
</p>
<p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>The gesture will eventually stop being ironic; the rich man’s
supporters will perform the gesture out of solidarity. Only the diehards
at first, but then more and more people will adopt the gesture as it
becomes decoupled from its original meaning, sanitized for overt public
displays, many having no idea, others having at least plausible
deniability, that the gesture ever signaled harmful intent.
</p>
<p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>Soon, it will be commonplace to perform the gesture. In fact, it
will seem crazy not to perform the gesture.
</p>
<p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>Acknowledge with a wink those who loved the gesture all along,
because they have finally achieved precisely what they set out to do
through you, their spiritual heir: making the gesture a symbol and
marker of the in-group, the protected and privileged class. Soon
thereafter, those in the out-group will be made to perform the gesture
as a demonstration of loyalty or else perish.

script to run R1 with a min-thinking-tokens parameter</a></strong>
</p>
Fantastically creative hack by Theia Vogel. The
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/20/deepseek-r1/">DeepSeek R1
family</a> of models output their chain of thought inside a
<code>&lt;think&gt;…&lt;/think&gt;</code> block. Theia found that you
can intercept that closing <code>&lt;/think&gt;</code> and replace it
with “Wait, but” or “So” or “Hmm” and trick the model into extending its
thought process, producing better solutions!
</p>
<p>
You can stop doing this after a few iterations, or you can keep on
denying the <code>&lt;/think&gt;</code> string and effectively force the
model to “think” forever.
</p>
<p>
<p>Theia’s code here works against Hugging Face transformers but I’m
confident the same approach could be ported to llama.cpp or MLX.</p>

<p>“Okinawa Island, officially Okinawa Main Island, is the largest of
the Okinawa Islands and the Ryukyu (Nansei) Islands of Japan in the
Kyushu region. It is the smallest and least populated of the five main
islands of Japan. The island is approximately 106 kilometres (66 mi)
long, an average 11 kilometres (7 mi) wide, and has an area of 1,206.98
square kilometers (466.02 sq mi). It is roughly 640 kilometres (350 nmi;
400 mi) south of the main island of Kyushu and the rest of Japan. It is
500 km (270 nmi; 310 mi) northeast of Taiwan. The total population of
Okinawa Island is 1,384,762. The greater Naha area has roughly 800,000
residents, while the city itself has about 320,000 people. Naha is the
seat of Okinawa Prefecture on the southwestern part of Okinawa Island.
Okinawa has a humid subtropical climate.”</p>

<strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/releases/tag/0.9">llm-gemini
0.9</a></strong>
</p>
This new release of my <code>llm-gemini</code> plugin adds support for
two new experimental models:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>learnlm-1.5-pro-experimental</code> is “an experimental
task-specific model that has been trained to align with learning science
principles when following system instructions for teaching and learning
use cases” -
<a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/learnlm">more here</a>.
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21</code> is a brand new version
of the Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking model
<a href="https://twitter.com/demishassabis/status/1881844417746632910">released
today</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Latest version also includes code execution, a 1M token content window
&amp; a reduced likelihood of thought-answer contradictions.
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>The most exciting new feature though is support for
<a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/grounding">Google search
grounding</a>, where some Gemini models can execute Google searches as
part of answering a prompt. This feature can be enabled using the new
<code>-o google_search 1</code> option.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/luebken/llm-logs-feedback">llm-logs-feedback</a>
is a plugin by Matthias Lübken for
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> which adds the ability to
store feedback on prompt responses, using new <code>llm
feedback+1</code> and <code>llm feedback-1</code> commands. These also
accept an optional comment, and the feedback is stored in a
<code>feedback</code> table in SQLite.
</p>
<p>
You can install the plugin from PyPI like this:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>llm install llm-logs-feedback</pre>

<p>
The full plugin implementation is in the

Tommy Hughes has been developing a whole array of LLM plugins, including
his
<a href="https://github.com/irthomasthomas/llm-plugin-generator">llm-plugin-generator</a>
which is a plugin that can help write new plugins!
</p>
<p>
He started by demonstrating
<a href="https://github.com/irthomasthomas/llm-model-gateway">llm-model-gateway</a>,
a plugin that adds a <code>llm serve</code> command which starts a
localhost server running an imitation of the OpenAI API against LLM
models:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>llm install llm-model-gateway

<p>
Tommy’s main demo was of
<a href="https://github.com/irthomasthomas/llm-consortium">llm-consortium</a>,
a plugin which can use a consortium of collaborating LLM models working
together to solve problems.
</p>

quality bread, such as sourdough or whole grain. Toast it to your
preferred level of crispness. While the bread is toasting, prepare a
ripe avocado. Cut it in half, remove the pit, and scoop the flesh into a
bowl. Mash the avocado with a fork, leaving some chunks for texture.
Season with salt, black pepper, and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to
prevent browning. Optional additions include a touch of red pepper
flakes.
</p>
<p>
Once the toast is ready, let it cool slightly before spreading the
seasoned avocado evenly over it. Consider lightly rubbing a cut garlic
clove on the warm toast for an extra layer of flavor (optional).
</p>
<p>
Enhance your avocado toast with your favorite toppings. Popular choices
include: everything bagel seasoning, sliced tomatoes, radishes, a
poached or fried egg (for added protein), microgreens, smoked salmon
(for a more savory option), feta cheese crumbles, or a drizzle of hot
sauce. For a finishing touch, drizzle with high-quality olive oil and
sprinkle with sesame or chia seeds for added texture.
</p>
<p>
Consider dietary needs when choosing toppings. For example, those
following a low-carb diet might skip the tomatoes and opt for more
protein and healthy fats.
</p>
<p>
Finally, pay attention to presentation. Arrange the toppings neatly for
a visually appealing toast. Serve immediately to enjoy the fresh flavors
and crispy toast.

But the really interesting thing is the full log of the prompts and
responses sent to Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o, followed by a combined
prompt to Gemini 1.5 Pro to have it arbitrate between the two responses.

Derek Willis teaches data journalism at the Philip Merrill College of
Journalism at the University of Maryland. For a recent project his
students built a
<a href="https://cnsmaryland.org/interactives/fall-2024/congressional_travel_explorer/index.html">Congressional
Travel Explorer</a> interactive using Datasette, AWS Extract and Claude
3.5 Sonnet to analyze travel disclosures from members of Congress.
</p>
<p>
One of the outcomes from the project was this story in Politico:
<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/30/israel-aipac-funded-congress-travel-00185167">Members
of Congress have taken hundreds of AIPAC-funded trips to Israel in the
past decade</a>.

builds on top of

cache answers to questions, using embeddings to return similar answers
if they have already been stored.

<p>
Using embeddings for de-duplication of similar questions is an
interesting way to apply LLM’s

I’ve demonstrated improvements I’ve been making to Datasette’s
<a href="https://enrichments.datasette.io/">Enrichments</a> system over
the past few weeks.
</p>
<p>
Enrichments allow you to apply an operation - such as geocoding, a
QuickJS JavaScript transformation or an LLM prompt - against selected
rows within a table.
</p>
<p>
The latest release of
<a href="https://github.com/datasette/datasette-enrichments/releases/tag/0.5">datasette-enrichments</a>
adds visible progress bars and the ability to pause, resume and cancel
an enrichment job that is running against a table.

We finished with three plugin demos from Alex, showcasing collaborative
features we have been developing for
<a href="https://www.datasette.cloud/">Datasette Cloud</a>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/datasette/datasette-write-ui">datasette-write-ui</a>
provides tools for editing and adding data to Datasette tables. A new
feature here is the ability to shift-click a row to open the editing
interface for that row.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/datasette/datasette-pins">datasette-pins</a>
allows users to pin tables and databases to their Datasette home page,
making them easier to find.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/datasette/datasette-comments">datasette-comments</a>
adds a commenting interface to Datasette, allowing users to leave
comments on individual rows in a table.
</li>
</ul>
