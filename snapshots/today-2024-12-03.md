## GHC 9.8.4 is now available

date: 2024-12-02, from: Glasgow Haskell Compiler

<h1>GHC 9.8.4 is now available</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">Ben Gamari - 2024-12-02</h4>

<p>The GHC developers are happy to announce the availability of GHC 9.8.4. Binary
distributions, source distributions, and documentation are available on the
<a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_9_8_4.html">release</a> page.</p>
<p>This release is a small release fixing a few issues noted in 9.8.3, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Update the <code>filepath</code> submodule to avoid a misbehavior of <code>splitFileName</code> under Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>Update the <code>unix</code> submodule to fix a compilation issue on <code>musl</code> platforms</p></li>
<li><p>Fix a potential source of miscompilation when building large projects on 32-bit platforms</p></li>
<li><p>Fix unsound optimisation of <code>prompt#</code> uses</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A full accounting of changes can be found in the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/9.8.4/docs/users_guide/9.8.4-notes.html">release notes</a>. As
some of the fixed issues do affect correctness users are encouraged to
upgrade promptly.</p>
<p>We would like to thank Microsoft Azure, GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake pool,
Well-Typed, Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, Haskell Foundation, and
other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial and in-kind support has
facilitated GHC maintenance and release management over the years. Finally,
this release would not have been possible without the hundreds of open-source
contributors whose work comprise this release.</p>
<p>As always, do give this release a try and open a <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if you see
anything amiss.</p>
<p>Happy compiling!</p>
