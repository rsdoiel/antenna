date: 2024-05-29, from: San Jose Mercury News

## US optimistic a deal to lessen threats of future pandemics is in sight

date: 2024-05-29, from: VOA News USA

Geneva — Despite the failure of negotiators to reach a pandemic accord ahead of this week’s World Health Assembly, a senior U.S. official remains optimistic that an agreement to lessen the threats of global killer disease outbreaks is in sight.


“We think the elements of a good deal are already on the table and that is why we feel optimistic because those are pretty good deals. It is just a matter now of fine-tuning it to make sure everybody says we are ready to sign on the dotted line,” Xavier Becerra, U.S. secretary of health and human services, told journalists at a briefing in Geneva Wednesday.


While disappointing, Becerra indicated that it was not surprising that an accord was not reached after two-and-a-half years of negotiations.




“Negotiations go on forever,” he said. “I think we have to put this in perspective. You do not build a nation overnight. You do not build an Empire State Building overnight. It takes a long time. Name me a major international achievement that came overnight.


“I think there is clear consensus that we cannot let the status quo be upon us if another pandemic comes,” he said.


His view reflects that of World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who, in his opening remarks at the World Health Assembly on Monday, assured delegates that the negotiations were on track and were not a failure.


“Of course, we all wish that we had been able to reach a consensus on the agreement in time for this health assembly and cross the finish line,” he said. “But I remain confident that you still will—because where there is a will, there is a way.”




WHO says 7,010,681 people have died from the COVID-19 outbreak as of April 13 and that a total of 704,753,890 cases have been confirmed in 229 countries and territories.


Becerra noted that threats against global health have an outsized influence on broader global political and economic interests.


“There is no stability without health. There is no security without health. Our nations cannot be strong unless they are healthy.


“Getting out of COVID is our main health priority,” Becerra said, noting that U.S. President Joe Biden was committed to achieving a pandemic treaty.


“When the president came in, we were experiencing two or three 9/11s every day in America in terms of loss of life. That is where we started. Today, we are walking around without masks. We are treating COVID the way we treat the flu,” he said, indicating that now is not the time to become complacent.


“I think we realize that another pandemic could be upon us. I mean, we are dealing with avian flu in the U.S. right now. We do not know how long it is going to be before we get another type of COVID kind of tragedy. We do not want to wait,” he said.




Sticking points to a pandemic treaty include disagreements over sharing information about pathogens that cause pandemics, a formula for global sharing of vaccines and medicine during international health emergencies, and financing to set up surveillance systems.


The WHO says that member states have agreed to continue to work during the World Health Assembly “to develop the world’s first pandemic accord” to prevent a repeat of the “global health, economic and social impacts” of the COVID-19 pandemic.


“We really have an incredible opportunity this week,” Loyce Pace, assistant secretary for global affairs at HHS, said.


“We have spent so long trying to come together and finding compromise and consensus. I think we talk about what is left to do, but I do not know if we talk enough about what has been done toward reaching an agreement.”


“So, whatever happens this week, we need some deliverable, if only to keep this momentum on towards any other work that should continue. We shouldn’t be leaving Geneva and go home without an accord, not after all that has been done,” Pace said.


Secretary Becerra agrees, saying that he does not think there are substantive disagreements about the essential elements of a pandemic treaty.


“It is more how they are packaged, how they are defined. People generally agree with what we have to do in order to be ready to take on any pandemic that may come across our path,” Becerra said.


“I am the son of immigrants. Optimism is in my DNA and so, I believe we are going to get this done because it would be tragic, especially given how far we have come and not get it done.


“We have to be ready,” he said. “Who knows what is coming around the corner. Something is going to broadside us. We just have to be ready.”

## Brazil’s Displacement Fears

date: 2024-05-29, from: Heatmap News

Biden administration invests in carbon removal</h3><p>The Department of Energy on Tuesday <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/doe-purchase-prize-carbon-removal" target="_self">gave $1.2 million</a> to companies competing for a chance to sell carbon removal credits to the federal government. These 24 semifinalists, which were each awarded $50,000, include nine direct air capture projects, seven biomass projects, five enhanced rock weathering projects, and three marine-based projects. Up to 10 of them will be offered federal contracts amounting to $30 million. “The Department of Energy hopes that by selecting 24 companies that have been vetted by government scientists, it’s sending a signal to the private sector that there are at least some projects that are legitimate,” <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/doe-purchase-prize-carbon-removal" rel="noopener" target="_self">Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo writes</a>, referencing struggles in the broader carbon credits marketplace.</p><h3>2. Brazil floods leave some permanently displaced</h3><p>Weeks of deadly flooding in Brazil displaced hundreds of thousands of people. Many of them now are — or will become — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/05/28/brazil-floods-climate-refugees/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate refugees</u></a>. Residents of the cities devastated by the floodwaters are now rethinking how to live alongside the increasingly unpredictable rains. As climate refugees, they join the survivors of other climate disasters in recent years and the millions more who are expected to follow in their footsteps over the coming decades. “Brazil is not going to be a one-off,” Andrew Harper, a senior official at the U.N. High Commission for Refugees, told <em><em>The Washington Post</em></em>. “What we are seeing is the start of something that will become more frequent and more extreme and lead to more people left vulnerable, with no choice but to move to a safer location.”</p><h3>3. New satellite will study clouds and climate</h3><p>SpaceX launched the EarthCARE (Earth Cloud, Aerosol, and Radiation Explorer) satellite, a joint project between the European Space Agency and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, on Tuesday in a mission that will <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyddezqrlmvo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study the impact</u></a> that clouds have on the climate. The satellite, which has been 20 years in the making, will use four instruments, including radar and imaging systems, to measure clouds’ altitude, structure, and movement. The mission will take place at a relatively low orbit and is expected to last at least three years. Researchers hope the data it collects will lead to improvements both in long-term climate modeling and short-term weather forecasting.</p><h3>4. Supreme Court to hear San Francisco’s case against the EPA</h3><p>The Supreme Court will <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4689715-supreme-court-san-francisco-challenge-clean-water-act/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hear a lawsuit</u></a> brought by the city and county of San Francisco against EPA Clean Water Act discharge regulations. Lawyers representing San Francisco argued in their petition that the federal regulations — which prohibit violations “of any applicable water quality standard” rather than setting numerical pollution limits — are too vague. “These prohibitions effectively tell permit holders nothing more than not to cause ‘too much’ pollution,” the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-753/290765/20240108152337022_2024-01-08%20SF%20Petition%20for%20Writ%20of%20Certiorari.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>petition said</u></a>. The EPA argued in response that the requirements are meant to keep permits in line with regional and state discharge standards. “Those standards, in turn, establish specific limits to which petitioner’s discharges must conform,” the EPA’s brief said. In recent years, the conservative Supreme Court has ruled against the EPA in high-profile cases. </p><h3>5. Poll: Voters favor climate accountability</h3><p>Almost two-thirds of U.S. voters want oil companies to ”be held legally accountable for their contributions to climate change,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/28/poll-climate-change-lawsuit-oil-industry" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>The Guardian</em></em></u><u> reported</u></a> Tuesday. A poll conducted by consumer advocacy nonprofit Public Citizen and progressive polling firm Data for Progress found that 62% of voters — including 84% of Democrats, 59% of independents and 40% of Republicans — supported the idea. Asked about their stance on “criminal charges being filed against oil and gas companies to hold them accountable for deaths caused by their contributions to climate change,” 49% expressed support and 38% said they were opposed. A growing number of states, counties, and cities are suing major oil companies for climate damages. “These national findings show these cases may be able to earn popular support, particularly in blue jurisdictions,” Grace Adcox, senior climate strategist at Data for Progress, told <em><em>The Guardian</em></em>.</p><h3>THE KICKER</h3><p>A five-bedroom house in Rodanthe, North Carolina, has become the sixth house along its stretch of seashore to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/05/28/rodanthe-home-collapse/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fall into the ocean</u></a> in the past four years as coastal erosion increasingly threatens homes built near the water.</p>

## U.S. child care is expensive — and not working for most families

date: 2024-05-29, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Despite cooling inflation, many Americans still say higher prices make it difficult to make ends meet. That&#8217;s especially the case for parents. The cost of child care has far outpaced overall inflation for the past few decades, to the point that it&#8217;s affecting the labor force. We discuss. But first: Tensions between Exxon-Mobil and some of its shareholders may well boil over this morning when the company holds its annual shareholder meeting.</p>

## Turbo9: a pipelined 6809 microprocessor IP

date: 2024-05-29, from: OS News

The Turbo9 is a pipelined microprocessor IP written in Verilog that executes a superset of the Motorola 6809 instruction set. It is a new modern microarchitecture with 16-bit internal datapaths that balances high performance vs small area / low power. The Turbo9R with a 16-bit memory interface achieves 0.69 DMIPS/MHz which is 3.8 times faster than Motorola&#8217;s original 8-bit MC6809 implementation. It is an active graduate research project at the Department of Electrical &#38; Computer Engineering at the University of Florida. ↫ Turbo9 GitHub page The Turbo9 is aimed at SoC sub-blocks and small mixed-signal ASIC, so it&#8217;s definitely not intended to be some sort of general purpose CPU. The reason for opting for the 6809 instead of, say, RISC-V or ARM, is that the 6809 enables a far smaller footprint due to being 16bit, which is all the target market really needs from the Turbo9. The current version of the Turbo9 is thoroughly verified and is capable of running C code. However, we still consider this version v0.9 because we are missing a few items. All the 6809 instructions and addressing modes have been implemented and tested except SYNC and CWAI. The signed versions of the Turbo9&#8217;s 16-bit divide and multiply need to be completed. Interrupts are partially implemented including SWI and Reset. ↫ Turbo9 GitHub page This is the kind of riveting content you&#8217;ll only really find on OSNews.

## With no resolution to Ukraine, Gaza wars, Biden focuses on domestic priorities

date: 2024-05-29, from: VOA News USA

With five months until the November election and no diplomatic solution in sight for wars in Ukraine and Gaza, President Joe Biden, who in 2020 ran on a campaign to end "forever wars," is shifting voters’ attention away from American entanglements abroad by focusing on domestic priorities. White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara has the story.

## Can we at least agree that killing is wrong?

date: 2024-05-29, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog


<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>I don’t think it’s possible to morally support the ongoing bombardment of Gaza, but that’s too weak a statement. What’s happening there seems to be — based on what I’ve read through the news, what I’ve seen in video, the stories that have been sent back to us — an atrocity. The latest story, from Rafah, is of an airstrike on a civilian evacuation zone where displaced families <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israeli-tanks-enter-central-rafah-palestinians-tent-camp-blaze-rcna154235">were sheltering in tents</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Images showed the area engulfed in flames as screaming Palestinians fled for safety, with some video shared on social media showing disturbing images, including severely burned corpses and a man holding what appeared to be the headless body of a small child.</p></blockquote><p>There’s nothing flippant to say about this. This isn’t sports, where you root for a team. It’s not a theoretical debate: certainly not for the families who have no way to escape, kettled as they are into a small strip of land under constant military bombardment.</p><p>The bombardment on Gaza is disproportionate and indefensible. <a href="https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/more-13000-children-reported-dead-gaza-famine-nears">Thirteen thousand children alone</a> have been killed. A quarter of surviving children have acute malnutrition. There’s nowhere for them to go, and nowhere for them to get the care they need. In the face of these conditions, there must be a ceasefire. <em>Obviously</em> there must be a ceasefire.</p><p>Making statements like this is fraught. It sometimes seems like we’re being asked to fall into weird ideological lines that have little to do with the humanity of the people involved. Following the events of October 7, I unfollowed multiple progressive Instagram accounts that not only described the attack and kidnappings as the necessary work of de-colonization, but applauded the action. It’s clear to me that Palestine has been annexed, its land <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement">illegally settled</a>, and its people made to suffer at the hands of increasingly-conservative Israeli policy. Protest and resistance are inevitable and justifiable. Regardless, I can’t support the killing and kidnapping of civilians, let alone accept <em>cheerleading</em> for it. Not ever.</p><p>By the same token, I see some people online call for an end to the state of Israel. What would that entail, exactly? Assuming it was a desirable goal, how might one go about achieving that? Dismantling it would involve unthinkable bloodshed.</p><p>Some people talk about how Hamas is the local government, and how the people there voted for them, so they deserve what’s happening to them. That it’s okay to bomb hospitals <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/01/middleeast/gaza-hospitals-destruction-investigation-intl-cmd/">because Hamas is hiding out in them</a> — regardless of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_shield">international law related to protecting the lives of human shields</a>.</p><p>The history, today’s political issues, and the road to a solution are far more complicated than can be conveyed by memes and soundbites. I have no solutions to the problems in this region or how to get to a lasting peace.</p><p>But some things are not complicated at all.</p><p>Don’t kill. Don’t subjugate. Don’t dehumanize. Don’t reduce lives, in all their complexity and beauty, to points and sides.</p><p>The core of this issue right now is — or should be — concern for human life. Everyone, regardless of nationality or political affiliation, should be appalled when children burn to death or are decapitated (whether they’re in an evacuation zone or not). The ruining of cities should never yield applause.</p><p>The protests on university campuses are the latest in a long line of campus anti-war protests, and I’m strongly in favor of them. Except, because of course this is true, there are people there who conflate the protest over policy with protests of anyone who is Israeli, or even anyone who is a Jew. I’ve personally heard stories of at least one person being spat on, not because of any rhetoric they were espousing, but simply because of who they were.</p><p>This all has the potential to escalate. I worry that it will. This is all already so horrific.</p><p>These are human beings. The Palestinian people are human beings. The Israeli people are human beings. Arabs are human beings. Jews are human beings. They are not their leaders; they are not their circumstances. They all - like all people - deserve to live, and live well. The death of any human being is never something to celebrate or to praise as a strategy. It’s all just endless tragedy.</p><p>Stop the killing. Find another way.</p></div>

## These Carbon Removal Companies Got the Energy Department’s Stamp of Approval

date: 2024-05-28, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjMzNjE3MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NDQ5NjQ1M30.dIu_LPJWQtlhZ2lCcGm38VxxrhoZBU2dhSdnEw_kTfU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">The Department of Energy is advancing its <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/carbon-removal-us-government" target="_self"><u>first-of-a-kind program </u></a>to stimulate demand for carbon removal by becoming a major buyer. On Tuesday, the agency awarded $50,000 to each of 24 semifinalist companies competing to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere on behalf of the U.S. government. It will eventually spend $30 million to buy carbon removal credits from up to 10 winners.</p><p>The nascent carbon removal industry is desperate for customers. At a conference held in New York City last week called Carbon Unbound, startup CEOs brainstormed how to convince more companies to buy carbon removal as part of their sustainability strategies. On the sidelines, attendees lamented to me that there were hardly even any potential buyers at the conference — <em><em>what a missed opportunity.</em></em></p><p>Conference panelists asserted that the industry needed to rebuild trust. Purchasing carbon credits has become a risky strategy for companies. In one investigation after another, journalists and researchers have shown that many of the projects behind these credits fail to produce the climate benefits they advertise. There’s a <a href="https://climatecasechart.com/case/berrin-v-delta-air-lines-inc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>class action lawsuit</u></a> against Delta Air Lines for marketing itself as “carbon neutral” after purchasing such questionable carbon offsets. </p><p>Carbon removal credits are technically different from the offsets that companies bought in the past, which were based on projects that reduce emissions to the atmosphere rather than remove carbon that’s already heating the planet. But there’s still a risk of sham projects. And because the field is relatively new, there’s not yet a set of widely agreed-upon standards to measure and verify how much carbon is being removed. </p><p>The Department of Energy hopes that by selecting 24 companies that have been vetted by government scientists, it’s sending a signal to the private sector that there are at least some projects that are legitimate. “We can’t wait to invest in CDR until those standards have been codified,” Noah Deich, the agency’s deputy assistant secretary of carbon management, told me. “We need to invest now so that we actually get the data that we can use to inform the standards, and then over time codify those standards and strengthen and improve them.”</p><p>The semifinalists represent a wide range of carbon removal methods. Nine of the companies are building machines that capture carbon dioxide directly from the air. Seven take advantage of the natural ability of plants and algae to suck up carbon, and have developed systems to sequester that carbon for far longer than would otherwise occur. Five employ rocks that naturally absorb carbon and have figured out how to speed up the process. The last three capture carbon from the ocean, enabling the world’s biggest carbon sink to draw down more from the atmosphere.</p><p>To proceed to the final round, all of these companies will have to draw up contracts that say how quickly they will be able to remove the promised tons of carbon, and who they will work with to measure and verify the process.</p><p>The Biden administration is spending billions on research, development, and deployment of carbon removal. Some of the semifinalists, like Climeworks, Heirloom Carbon, and 1PointFive, were already selected for grants from the DOE to build the U.S.’s first “direct air capture hubs” — projects capable of removing one million tons of carbon from the air per year. But those hubs will fail if the companies don’t ultimately find buyers for their carbon removal. “Every single CDR project that we’re seeing today requires some sort of voluntary credit sale to be profitable,” said Deich. </p><p>The Department of Energy’s $30 million budget to buy carbon removal is relatively small. The semifinalists said they could deliver a wide range of credits with their share of the funds, from 3,000 over a three-year period, to more than 30,000. In any case, DOE is unlikely to afford much more than 100,000 tons of carbon taken out of the atmosphere, equivalent to about 0.002% of the CO2 the United States emitted in 2022. When distributed among 10 companies, it’s certainly not enough to finance a project. But Deich told me he sees this contest as a public-private partnership. The agency is challenging the semifinalists to leverage the DOE’s recognition to try and sell as many credits as they can. It’s one of the criteria they’ll be judged on for the final phase of the contest.</p><p>Several semifinalists I spoke with were optimistic the DOE’s backing would help. “One of the things that the private sector is wrestling with is the technical underwriting of various carbon dioxide removal technologies,” Barclay Rogers, the CEO of the carbon removal company Graphyte, told me. Graphyte’s process almost sounds too simple to work. The company takes discarded plant matter from forests and fields, dries it out so that it doesn’t decompose, compresses it into bricks, and then buries them. Graphyte has already built a small processing facility in Arkansas and secured a burial site that could store an estimated 1.5 million tons of CO2. Rogers was excited to have DOE’s backing as “a broad signal to the market of the viability of Graphyte’s carbon casting process.”</p><p>Others were grateful that the government was branching out to new technologies. To date, most of the DOE’s carbon removal programs have supported direct air capture. Companies working on other approaches have been shut out of funding opportunities, and some worry that this has contributed to a perception among buyers that direct air capture is the only valid method. “We think this is a huge step forward, since it’s really the first time not only that the U.S. government is going to become a purchaser of carbon removal, but also funding a full range of carbon removal solutions,” Nora Cohen Brown, head of market development and policy at Charm Industrial, told me. (Charm also buries plant waste underground, but in the form of oil.) “We really think that biomass CDR has immense potential,” she said. “It’s a big deal to have DOE’s blessing for that pathway.”</p><p>Edward Sanders, the chief operating officer of a startup called Equatic, told me that being a semifinalist meant the company would be able to build a plant in the U.S. much sooner than it initially planned. Equatic has developed technology to remove carbon from seawater, enabling the ocean to take up more carbon. It’s currently building its first large-scale plant in Singapore. “This tells prospective future buyers that there is a role to play in the near term in the U.S. for a marine-based pathway.”</p><p>Many of the companies on the list, including the three I just mentioned, have already been relatively successful in selling credits. Graphyte sold 10,000 to American Airlines. Equatic has a 62,000 deal with Boeing. Charm will remove more than 100,000 tons for Frontier Climate, a group of buyers that includes Stripe, Alphabet, Shopify, and Meta. But even though a handful of tech companies and airlines are buying carbon removal, these sweeping gestures are not enough to sustain the industry, let alone grow it to the scale that scientists say will be necessary to halt climate change. </p><p>DOE’s purchase may help increase confidence in some of these companies and approaches, but it may not do much to solve another problem: There’s little incentive for anyone to pay for carbon removal today, and it’s much more expensive than other options companies have to reduce their emissions. Credits can cost between several hundred to more than a thousand dollars each.</p><p>Deich said the agency was trying to set an example for other buyers. Instead of creating a net-zero target and searching for the cheapest credits to accomplish its goal, it’s prioritizing quality and only buying what it can afford. “We need to pay what it costs,” he said, “and then developers can develop projects and figure out how to do it cheaper so that over time, it starts to come down the cost curve significantly, and we can buy larger and larger quantities.”</p><p id="semifinalists">But this is only the near term plan to help the industry mature. Ultimately, Deich doesn’t think that the voluntary trade of credits will be enough to support the levels of carbon removal that will make a difference in climate change. He sees this purchase prize program as a way to start building the government’s capacity to play a larger role. “There’s going to need to be some sort of mandate or public procurement that happens for the field to really scale beyond 2030,” he said.</p><h3 id="semifinalists">The full list of semifinalists:</h3><p>Avnos, Inc. — direct air capture — 3,000 credits</p><p>Carbon America — direct Air Capture — 3,400 credits</p><p>CarbonCapture, Inc. — direct air capture — 3,333 credits</p><p>Climeworks — direct air capture — 3,500 credits</p><p>Global Thermostat and Fervo Energy — direct air capture — 3,500 credits</p><p>Heirloom — direct air capture — 3,030 credits</p><p>1PointFive — direct air capture — 3,861 credits</p><p>280 Earth — direct air capture — 3,000 credits</p><p>8 Rivers — direct air capture — 7,200 credits</p><p>Arbor Energy — biomass with carbon removal and storage — 8,000 credits</p><p>Carbon Lockdown — biomass with carbon removal and storage — 17,143 credits</p><p>Charm Industrial — biomass with carbon removal and storage — 5,000 credits</p><p>Clean Energy Systems — biomass with carbon removal and storage — 11,320 credits</p><p>Climate Robotics — biochar — 30,252 credits</p><p>Graphyte<strong> </strong>—<strong> </strong>biomass with carbon removal and storage — 30,000 credits</p><p>Vaulted Deep —<strong> </strong>biomass with carbon removal and storage — 10,320 credits</p><p>Alkali Earth — enhanced rock weathering and mineralization — 8,108 credits</p><p>CREW Carbon — enhanced rock weathering and mineralization — 7,500 credits</p><p>Eion — enhanced rock weathering and mineralization — 9,900 credits</p><p>Lithos Carbon — enhanced rock weathering and mineralization — 8,109 credits</p><p>Mati Carbon — enhanced rock weathering and mineralization — 4,561 credits</p><p>Ebb Carbon<strong> </strong>— marine-based carbon removal — 3,000 credits</p><p>Equatic<strong> </strong>— marine-based carbon removal — 6,521 credits</p><p>Vycarb Inc.<strong> </strong>— marine-based carbon removal — 3,000 credits</p>

## Georgian parliament overrides veto of controversial foreign agent law

date: 2024-05-28, from: VOA News USA

Tbilisi, Georgia — Georgia’s parliament on Tuesday overrode the president’s veto of a controversial foreign agent law, despite protests at home and criticism in Western capitals, including a U.S. threat to impose sanctions.


The new measure is officially called the “Law on Transparency of Foreign Influence.” However, opponents have dubbed it the "Russian law," a reference to Russia’s foreign agent law, which requires anyone who receives support from outside Russia, or is seen as acting under “foreign influence,” to register as a foreign agent. 


“I was watching the live broadcast of the vote with my mother. Till the last moment, we still had a hope. We hoped that their consciences wouldn’t allow it. But it happened, and I am really saddened. However, what gives me hope are the demonstrators,” said Nana Jikia, a student. “We want European future; we do not want to be a Russian province.”


The Georgian law requires civil society organizations, media and other entities receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as agents of foreign interests. The law primarily targets U.S. and European Union democracy assistance programs.


President Salome Zourabichvili vetoed the legislation on May 18, but it was widely expected that the ruling Georgian Dream party’s parliamentary majority would override the veto.




“There's only one way forward for Georgia. For its sovereignty and freedom and liberty, and that is to remove this government democratically through next elections, to continue this protest, to have an overwhelming moral majority and, like 30 years ago in 1990 when communists were defeated even before elections, they have to accept that they have to give up power,” Giga Bokeria, head of the opposition European Georgia party, told VOA.


Georgian Dream reintroduced the law in April, a year after it abandoned in March 2023 after it sparked mass protests.


Protesters view the law as a move by the government to tilt the country toward Moscow, even though polls show more than 80% of Georgians support Georgia’s path toward EU membership and 73% endorse the country’s bid to join NATO.


General elections in October will determine whether the Georgian Dream party remains in power for a fourth term. Georgian nongovernmental organizations say the foreign agent law may hinder international organizations' ability to observe the October vote. While the government claims the law promotes transparency, local NGOs and Georgia’s Western partners view it as targeting Western funding for Georgian civil society.


“Having no chances of victory in the upcoming general elections in October if they are conducted freely and fairly, [Bidzina] Ivanishvili” — Georgian Dream’s shadow leader — “is tightening his grip on power through harsh authoritarian measures and is openly driving the country into Russian influence,” former Georgian ambassador to the United States David Sikharulidze told VOA outside the parliament building in Tbilisi.


“It’s very much in line with Putin’s tactics,” he said.


“This law is a Russian law in essence and spirit, which contradicts our constitution and all European standards,” Zourabichvili said in her veto statement.




Zourabichvili, whose election as president in 2018 was supported by Georgian Dream, has increasingly found herself at odds with the party.


Apprehension over the domestic and foreign policy trajectory of Georgia’s government has grown since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Official Tbilisi refused to side with Ukraine publicly or to join sanctions against Moscow, while attacking Ukrainian officials publicly and echoing anti-Western rhetoric.


In addition, U.S. lawmakers have raised concerns about Georgia’s role in helping Russia evade Western sanctions.


For more than a month and a half, tens of thousands of Georgians have taken to the streets to protest the foreign agent law, the largest protests the country has seen since it gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.


“Georgian people have erupted in protest. They deserve more than just statements from the Western partners,” Sikharulidze said.


Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced sanctions against those "responsible for undermining democracy in Georgia."


“The Department of State is implementing a new visa restriction policy for Georgia that will apply to individuals who are responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia, as well as their family members,” Blinken said in a statement. “This includes individuals responsible for suppressing civil society and freedom of peaceful assembly in Georgia through a campaign of violence or intimidation.”


Georgian Dream officials dismissed the visa restrictions as interference in Georgia’s internal affairs.


“The blackmail with visa restrictions are nothing but a crude attempt to limit the independence and sovereignty of Georgia," the Georgian Dream party said in a statement, labeling the move "anti-Georgian."


For their part, European Union officials have warned that adopting the foreign agent law would jeopardize Georgia’s bid for EU membership.


"The law of foreign influence is not in line with EU values. If the law is enacted, it will impact Georgia’s EU path," said EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.


Georgian officials have dismissed the critical voices in Washington and Brussels as part of what they call the “Global War Party,” which one Georgian Dream MP described to a British podcaster as a “‘force akin to the Freemasons.”

## Jef Raskin’s Canon Cat

date: 2024-05-28, from: OS News

Few things in technology excites me more than an amazing computer I have never heard of before &#8211; especially one with pedigree. Many people take a casual glance at this machine and say, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that an overgrown word processor?&#8221; And one could certainly think so, in part because of its keyboard-centric operation, but mostly from the utterly uncomprehending way Canon advertised it in 1987. Canon dubbed the Cat a &#8220;work processor&#8221; because of its built-in telecommunications, modem and word processor even though Jef Raskin, its designer, had intended it as a &#8220;people&#8217;s computer&#8221; that could be inexpensive, accessible and fully functional — all things he had hoped to accomplish at Apple after first launching the Macintosh project, prior to departing in 1982. Canon, however, never fully grasped the concept either. Apart from the tone-deaf marketing, Canon sold the device through their typewriter division and required the display to only show what a daisywheel printer could generate, limiting its potential as a general purpose workstation. ↫ Cameron Kaiser Wait, wait, wait. You mean to tell me there&#8217;s a unique, well-designed computer that seemed ahead of its time, sold by a printer and copier company, that failed in the market due to botched marketing and grotesque misunderstanding among management of what the device is supposed to be? What are the odds this happens twice? The Canon Cat was designed and built by Jeff Raskin&#8217;s &#8211; of Macintosh fame &#8211; company Information Appliance, Inc., and licensed to Canon. It&#8217;s an all-in-one 68000-based computer with a bitmap display, an operating system stored in ROM, and a comprehensive Forth environment easily accessible despite the device autostarting to a word processor (because Canon). Much like some of the predecessor machines Raskin had worked on before licensing the Cat to Canon, the Cat has an intriguing input method that I&#8217;d never seen before. Instead of a mouse or even cursor keys, it has two keys labeled &#8220;Leap&#8221; that are used for manipulating the text cursor. In fact, there aren&#8217;t even conventional cursor keys. The Cat has the same &#8220;leap&#8221; keys as the Swyft and SwyftCard, in a bright but tasteful pink, and they work the same way to jump to portions of the document or into other documents. You can also use them to scroll with the SHIFT key, or move by single letters, sentences or paragraphs. The LEAP keys are also how you highlight text blocks to manipulate by LEAPing to the beginning, LEAPing to the end, and then pressing them together. ↫ Cameron Kaiser The Forth programming environment is also very interesting. It was hidden in that Canon didn&#8217;t really want you to use it, but Raskin&#8217;s company made no secret of it, and it was easily accessible. It uses a special dialect of Forth, which can be used at either a traditional OK prompt, or just by typing Forth code into the word processor, highlighting it, and executing it with a keyboard shortcut, after which any output will be displayed in the word processor as well. The Canon Cat was a market failure, and hence it shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise it&#8217;s exceedingly rare.

## Microsoft published minimum system requirements, CPU support for Windows 11 LTSC 2024

date: 2024-05-28, from: OS News

Aside from that, the company also announced Windows 11 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2024 this week. The company has also published the minimum system requirements as well as supported processor families. They have been categorized as Preferred and Optional. Interestingly, SSD has been added as a minimum system requirement, which has been a rumour about the client OS since mid-2022. ↫ Sayan Sen at NeoWin The LTSC release, which is not really supposed to be used by average consumers, is still remarkably popular. It contains a fixed feature set and gets far fewer updates than regular Windows releases, it omits otherwise stock applications like Edge, and gives its users far more control over which updates are and are not installed. LTSC also enjoys 10 years of support from Microsoft. Interestingly enough, the minimum specifications for the IoT version of LTSC do not require a TPM 2.0, unlike the regular version of Windows, which infamously does require one. I would assume that the &#8220;preferred&#8221; minimum requirements, which does require TPM 2.0, line up very well with the minimum requirements for the regular LTSC version of Windows 11. Both will become available later this year, alongside the regular release of Windows 11 24H2.

## Analysts urge shift from military to economic solutions to terrorism in Sahel

Africa's Sahel has become the epicenter of global terrorism, prompting nations to intensify efforts to counter the violence through military training such as the Flintlock 2024 drills in Ghana and the Ivory Coast. Analysts, however, say that addressing economic deficiencies in the region would be a more effective deterrent. Senanu Tord reports from Tamale, Ghana.

## Tom Steyer Is Baffled By Warren Buffett’s Oil Bets

date: 2024-05-28, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjMzNDUwNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MzAwMjY0OH0.4P2clRlAiERUniJCJOnkLA0aLX85AzOMLoRzBcZVnEk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">If you’re looking for a relatively optimistic read on the fight against climate change, Tom Steyer’s new book is out today. Called <em><em>Cheaper, Better Faster: How We’ll Win the Climate War</em></em>, it dives into the billionaire’s perspective on the state of the climate crisis and the clean energy solutions helping the world decarbonize. Steyer’s perspective is informed by the many hats he wears — investor, philanthropist, long shot 2020 presidential candidate, Yale man, and co-founder of the investment firm Galvanize Climate Solutions. </p><p>I chatted with Steyer a few weeks ago about his book, his guiding investment principles, and how and why people become environmentalists. Here are three things I found noteworthy<strong>:</strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>1. Steyer thinks Warren Buffett is making a bad bet.</strong></p><p>While Steyer admits that “no one’s ever gotten rich betting against Warren Buffett,” he believes the billionaire investor has got it wrong when it comes to oil and gas investments. Buffett’s firm, Berkshire Hathaway, has a 28% stake in Occidental Petroleum and a nearly 7% stake in Chevron.</p><p>“Of the 8 billion people alive today, it’s possible that no one is better than Warren at predicting the future of commercial activity,” Steyer writes in his book. “But in the case of fossil fuels, he doesn’t seem to recognize how quickly our ability to develop and deploy clean energy is growing — and how cheap that energy is becoming.” </p><p>“He has generally been a very high minded, good guy,” Steyer told me. “[But] I look at these investments, and I don’t understand how those reserves can get developed without pushing us to a place from a climate standpoint that is unsupportable ... Every scenario like that puts us in a climate bind.”</p><p>Steyer ultimately likens investing in fossil fuels to betting on whale oil, a fuel that powered lamps in the 18th and 19th centuries. “We should not be rooting to keep the whale blubber business going and spending a lot of American tax dollars to support whale blubber. Because it turns out, that’s not the future. It’s really important for America that we be at the forefront of economic change.”</p><p><strong>2. Galvanize Climate Solutions is more than a VC firm.</strong></p><p>Steyer co-founded the climate investment firm Galvanize in 2021 with fellow investor Katie Hall. Last September, <a href="https://galvanizeclimate.com/news/galvanize-climate-solutions-closes-first-venture-and-growth-equity-fund/" target="_blank"><u>the firm announced that it had raised over $1 billion</u></a> for its first fund, which targets investments in early to growth stage climate companies “that can drive meaningful decarbonization over the next decade,” according to Saloni Multani, co-head of the fund. </p><p>What helps set the firm apart is its variety of funding strategies. It not only makes venture capital investments in early stage companies, but growth equity investments to help companies reach scale, public equity investments (that is, purchasing stock) in publicly traded corporations, and <a href="https://galvanizeclimate.com/investment-strategies/real-estate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>even real estate investments</u></a>. Last month Galvanize <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240426030631/en/Galvanize-Real-Estate-Acquires-First-Asset-in-Pioneering-Profitable-Decarbonization-Strategy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>purchased its first building</u></a>, an industrial facility in the Baltimore-Washington corridor that the firm aims to decarbonize via rooftop solar, mechanical upgrades, and other energy efficiency measures. The firm also plans to invest in and decarbonize apartment buildings, student housing, and storage facilities. </p><p>“We want to buy buildings and make them net zero and prove you can make more money doing it. We want to be in the early stage companies that are leading the tech revolutions. We want to actually be a partner in the public domain, owning stock and partnering with the corporate leaders, the CEO, the C suite,” Steyer told me. “So it’s an actual activist strategy, but as partners to the organizations that are trying to lead the revolution, not as opponents.”</p><p><strong>3. The path to sustainability runs through economic self interest.</strong></p><p>When I asked Steyer to what degree he’s been able to mobilize his friends and fellow billionaires to get onboard with the climate cause, he didn’t exactly say it’s been a rousing success. Instead, he emphasized that people end up making sustainable choices for a variety of reasons – and that it often starts with economic practicalities rather than climate consciousness.</p><p>“A lot of people think that you are an environmentalist, and then you put solar on your roof. But actually, I think you put solar on your roof, and then you become an environmentalist,” Steyer said. “I think getting in the game actually changes people’s attitudes.”</p><p>This ladders up to statewide politics around renewables as well, he said. “So if you think about a state where the elected officials have been very outspoken against renewables and climate response, it would be Texas. But if you look at Texas, they’ve tripled the amount of solar they have over the last three years. It’s expected to go up 35% more this year. They’re by far the biggest wind generator in the country. They’re not being nice. It’s a good deal.”</p>

## Judge denies request to restrict Trump statements about law enforcement in classified records case

date: 2024-05-28, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The judge overseeing Donald Trump's classified documents case in Florida on Tuesday denied prosecutors' request to bar the former president from making public statements that could endanger law enforcement agents participating in the prosecution. 


Prosecutors had told U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon that the restriction was necessary to protect law enforcement from potential threats and harassment after the presumptive Republican presidential nominee baselessly claimed that the Biden administration wanted to kill him during a search of his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, nearly two years ago. 


Cannon chided prosecutors in her order denying their request, saying they didn't give defense lawyers adequate time to discuss the matter before it was filed Friday evening. The judge warned prosecutors that failing to comply with court requirements in the future may lead to sanctions. She denied the request without prejudice, meaning prosecutors could file it again. 


A spokesperson for special counsel Jack Smith's team declined to comment Tuesday. 


The decision came as Trump's lawyers were delivering their closing arguments at trial in another criminal case against Trump in New York stemming from a hush money payment to a porn actor during the 2016 presidential campaign. 


It's the latest example of bitterness between Cannon, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, and prosecutors who have accused the former president of illegally hoarding at his Mar-a-Lago estate classified documents that he took with him after he left the White House in 2021 and then obstructing the FBI's efforts to get them back. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. 


Cannon has repeatedly chided prosecutors both in hearings and in court papers over a number of matters, including telling Smith's team during one hearing that they were "wasting the court's time." Prosecutors have also signaled their frustration with Cannon's rulings, saying in one recent court filing that a request from the judge was based on a "fundamentally flawed legal premise." 


Prosecutors' request followed a distorted claim by Trump earlier this week that the FBI agents who searched his Mar-a-Lago estate in August 2022 were "authorized to shoot me" and were "locked & loaded ready to take me out & put my family in danger." 


The presumptive Republican presidential nominee was referring to the disclosure in a court document that the FBI, during the search in Palm Beach, Florida, followed a standard use-of-force policy that prohibits the use of deadly force except when the officer conducting the search has a reasonable belief that the "subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person." 


Prosecutors said in court papers late Friday that Trump's false suggestion that federal agents "were complicit in a plot to assassinate him" expose law enforcement officers "to the risk of threats, violence, and harassment." They had urged the judge to bar Trump from making any comments that "pose a significant, imminent, and foreseeable danger to law enforcement agents" participating in the case. 


Defense attorneys in a court filing late Monday called prosecutors' proposed restriction on Trump's speech "unconstitutional" and noted that the identities of law enforcement officers in the case are subject to a protective order preventing their public release. Defense attorneys said they asked Smith's team on Friday if the two sides could meet on Monday before prosecutors submit their request to give the defense time to discuss it with Trump. 


But prosecutor David Harbach said the situation needed to be addressed urgently, saying in an email to the defense that Trump created a situation that "necessitated a prompt request for relief that could not wait the weekend to file." They told the judge in their filing late Friday while Trump's lawyers didn't believe there is any "imminent danger," Trump had continued that day to make false statements "smearing and endangering the agents who executed the search." 


A spokesperson for Trump's campaign, Steven Cheung, said in a statement Tuesday that "the entire documents case was a political sham from the very beginning and it should be thrown out entirely." 


It's among four criminal cases Trump is confronting as he seeks to reclaim the White House, but outside of the ongoing New York hush money prosecution, it's unclear that any of the other three will reach trial before the November election. 


Trump has already had restrictions placed on his speech in two of the other cases over incendiary comments officials say threaten the integrity of the prosecutions. 


In the New York case, Trump has been fined and threatened with jail time for repeatedly violating a gag order that bars him from making public statements about witnesses, jurors and some others connected to the matter. 


He's also subject to a gag order in his federal criminal election interference case in Washington. That order limits what he can say about witnesses, lawyers in the case and court staff, though an appeals court freed him to speak about special counsel Smith, who brought the case.

## Who actually uses Instagram’s Threads app? Taiwanese protestors

<p>"While young Taiwanese users discuss everything from relationships to celebrity gossip on Threads, the app has gradually become a gathering space for progressives, who favor independence from China to defend the island’s democracy."</p>

<p>Threads has an official stance of not promoting political use.

## Consumption-to-creation ratio

date: 2024-05-28, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>You're currently reading this post either in your RSS feed, in your inbox, or in your browser. You are consuming content. Consuming content is what the majority of the people do most of the time online.  But what's the ideal ratio between consuming and creating content? I'd argue that a 100/0 split in favour of consumption is not ideal the same way a 0/100 also isn't. You need to consume at least some content in order to help your ideas evolve.</p>
<p>I posted 429 times on this site since January 1st, 2017. That's 429 posts in 2704 days or one every roughly 6 days. How many posts have I read in that same time span? Let's be conservative and assume I read 5 blog posts a day. That's more than 13500 blog posts and would put my consumption to creation ratio at around 97/3 which doesn't sound that much different than 100/0 but the actual, practical difference is huge. The difference is a blog with 429 posts in 7 and a half years.</p>
<p>Could that ratio be better? In theory yeah but how much better? Let's imagine I was posting once a day, every day. That would put my ratio at around 85/15. In order to go below that I'd either need to consume less content or I'd have to post more than once a day which, on a personal blog, it's completely unreasonable unless you treat your blog as a Twitter/Instagram replacement and that's not my case.</p>
<p>That 97/3 split, as I said, comes out of the very conservative assumption that I consume 5 posts a day. It doesn't take into consideration everything else I might consume: books, audio content, movies. If I were to factor in all that consumption I'd bet that my ratio is probably more close to 99/1 which sounds wrong but it really isn't when you stop to think about it.</p>
<p>I believe people should consume less content and produce more. Finding an output for creativity is important. But it's unreasonable to expect people to stop consuming content and replace that consumption with creation because the ratio will always be inevitably skewed towards consumption. And that's ok. If you're not a creative person, if you find hating yourself because you consume too much content and not create enough, embrace the fact that even a very tiny improvement, from 100/1 to 99.9/0.1 can mean a lot. It's the difference between letting your blog die and posting something a couple of times a year. Which is a substantial difference if you ask me!</p>
<p>Also, while I'm here talking about ratios, it's important to acknowledge the fact that not everyone can be creative in the same way. I often write that everyone should ditch social media and start blogging but the reality is that most people on social media are lurkers and for a lurker there's no point in having a blog. But, what you can do, is to engage with the people who do blog. Send them an email, let them know that you silently consume what they create, support what they do via tiny donations. It goes a long way.</p>                <hr>

The changes will enable more U.S. financial support for small private businesses in Cuba, enhance internet-based services on the island and broaden access to financial services.


The new U.S. measures come as the communist-run island faces a social and economic crisis, including severe shortages of food, fuel, electricity and medicine.




A senior administration official stated that the new authorization allows Cuba’s independent private sector entrepreneurs to open and remotely access U.S. bank accounts, including through U.S. online payment platforms.


As of 2021, Cuban entrepreneurs can establish small and medium private enterprises under Cuban law. By the latest count, there are over 11,000 registered private businesses in Cuba.


“It’s important to note that the new definition for independent private sector entrepreneurship excludes prohibited officials of the Cuban government, such as National Assembly members, Cuban military officers, certain ministry staff, regime propagandists and prohibited members of the Cuban Communist Party,” the senior official told reporters during a briefing on Tuesday.


New U.S. regulatory measures will benefit the Cuban people while continuing to minimize resources to the Cuban government, said another senior official in President Joe Biden’s administration.


“We believe that the growth of an independent entrepreneurial private sector in Cuba is fully aligned with our values and is the best hope for generating economic development and employment in Cuba,” said the senior official.


The Treasury Department said that Tuesday’s regulatory changes will allow Cuban nationals to open, maintain and remotely use U.S. bank accounts, including through online payment platforms, to conduct authorized or exempt transactions, whether the independent private sector entrepreneur is physically located in the United States, Cuba or another country.


Earlier this month, the U.S. removed Cuba from its list of countries "not cooperating fully" in the fight against terrorism. However, Cuba remains on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list.


The cooperation against terrorism list, which the State Department is required by law to provide to Congress, is not the same as the State Sponsors of Terrorism list.


U.S. officials declined to comment on whether the State Department has begun a formal review of Cuba's presence on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. U.S. sanctions against the Cuban government, its military intelligence and security services remain in place.

## How Floods Are Contributing to Pregnancy Loss in India

date: 2024-05-28, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjMxMTI3OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNzk3MzQ5NH0.S1k4L4SM3tYuGPd0j0psnvk4RW5Ecd3OmjtCvMJF4lg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Ashwini Khandekar was in her first few months of pregnancy when the flood came. This was July 2021, the peak of the annual monsoon season, when a downpour destroyed more than 300 houses in Ganeshwadi, a village 400 kilometers south of Mumbai in India’s Maharashtra state. Authorities instructed Khandekar and her husband to evacuate, she told me, “but I couldn’t leave my house because all the evacuation centers were full. I had nowhere to go.” Though in the end her home was spared, for the next 15 days, Khandekar lived in constant fear, praying until the waters finally abated. </p>
<p>Four months later, Khandekar went to the doctor for a prenatal checkup. Her child, she learned, showed signs of anencephaly, a condition in which the fetal brain and skull fail to develop normally. Usually, babies born with anencephaly die within a few hours, and most pregnancies end in miscarriage. To cross-check the doctor’s claims, Khandekar visited eight more hospitals. Everyone confirmed the same. “I was heartbroken,” she said. </p>
<p>When a community health-care worker, Kavita Magdum, examined Khandekar’s medical records, she found that Khandekar had suffered from a severe deficiency of iron and folic acid, a known <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/anencephaly.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>risk factor for anencephaly</u></a>. This, in turn, pointed back to the storm. “She was traumatized by the flood and wasn’t getting a nutrient-rich diet for several weeks,” Magdum told me. The roads in and out of the village were closed for 20 days, cutting off food supplies. During this time, she ate only cooked rice and wheat flatbread. Sometimes she didn’t eat at all.</p>
<p>By the end of December, a month after she learned of her child’s condition, Khandekar had lost the pregnancy. She was 20 years old at the time.</p>
<p>Though tragic, stories like Khandekar’s are not rare. A research paper published in <em><em>Nature</em></em> this year found that from 2010 to 2020, maternal exposure to floods led to an average of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44508-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>107,888 lost pregnancies</u></a> per year in low- and middle-income countries, with South Asia reporting the most cases. Lack of access to nutrient-rich foods was one of the causes the researchers identified, along with physical and mental stress, disease, and lack of housing and safe childbirth services.</p>
<p>This year’s monsoon season will begin in June and stretch through September. The Indian Government has <a href="https://www.businesstoday.in/india/story/rainfall-prediction-india-likely-to-receive-above-average-monsoon-in-2024-says-govt-429659-2024-05-15#:~:text=Rainfall%20prediction%3A%20India%20is%20expected,are%20currently%20reeling%20under%20heatwave." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>forecast</u></a> above-average rainfall this year, at 106% of the long-term average. In the first two decades of this century, floods impacted <a href="https://www.preventionweb.net/files/74124_humancostofdisasters20002019reportu.pdf?startDownload=true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>1.5 billion</u></a> people in Asia, accounting for 93% of the globally affected population. Last year, over <a href="https://library.wmo.int/records/item/68890-state-of-the-climate-in-asia-2023" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>80% </u></a>of hydrometeorological disasters in Asia were floods and storms. </p>
<p>About <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30727-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>89%</u></a> of the world’s flood-exposed population resides in low- and middle-income countries that lack adequate health-care facilities. India alone has more than <a href="https://platform.who.int/data/maternal-newborn-child-adolescent-ageing/indicator-explorer-new/MCA/women-of-reproductive-age-(15-49-years)-population-(thousands)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>378 million</u></a> women of childbearing age, and has experienced an average of <u>17 yearly flood events</u> in the past two decades. Floods affected more than <a href="https://cwc.gov.in/sites/default/files/flood-damage-data-merged.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>218 million</u></a> people in India from 2015 to 2020, and destroyed crops on nearly <a href="https://cwc.gov.in/sites/default/files/flood-damage-data-merged.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>35 million hectares</u></a> of farmland, leading to rampant food insecurity. During this time, stillbirths in India increased <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-023-05470-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>28.6%</u></a>. </p>
<p>For women and their children, the risk begins even before a pregnancy occurs. Simran Jamadar was also 20 years old and living in Maharashtra’s tiny Kanwad village when the floods arrived in 2021. “The water was at least four feet in our house at 5 p.m.,” said Jamadar, forcing her to evacuate. Walking through muddy water with her family to the evacuation center 10 kilometers away, she had to tread carefully lest she disturb an unseen snake. After she reached her destination, she spent 12 days crammed in with 6,000 people from 15 villages. Overstressed and underslept, Jamadar found it difficult to eat. On top of everything else, the experience brought up painful memories from just over a year before, when another flood had wiped out her home, along with all its furniture, crucial papers, and six months of food supplies. </p>
<p>Five months later, still grappling with the trauma of the flood, Jamadar became pregnant. At about the seven-month mark, she experienced a sudden and unbearable stomachache and vomited. Sonography reports showed that she had developed an incompetent cervix — a weakened womb unable to hold a baby. Six hours later, Jamadar gave birth. The child was born and “passed away within a day,” Anita Kamble, a community health-care worker from Jamadar’s village, told me.</p>
<p>Kamble spoke to more than 30 community health-care workers from the flood-affected villages and found a similar pattern of stillbirths associated with stress — even when that stress began before the women became pregnant. This squares with other findings from the <em><em>Nature</em></em> study, which showed a significant association between pregnancy loss and exposure to floods even six months before conception. A controlled <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4714539/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a> of 340 women from Sweden who’d been pregnant in the same year found that 54% of those who experienced stress during pregnancy such as depression or anxiety gave birth prematurely.</p>
<p>With flooding, disruptions and their attending stressors can last for months, and sometimes even years. “The trauma was visible on her face,” Kamble said of Jamadar.</p>
<p>“The most important buffer for stressed pregnant women is social support,” Gloria Giarratano, a professor of nursing at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, told me. That includes resources to help cope with psychiatric stressors. Giarratano was the lead author of a study of women in New Orleans post-Hurricane Katrina, which <u><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07399332.2018.1535600" target="_blank">found</a></u> that women without a network of trusted people to rely on were the most likely to become depressed while pregnant. The more support they have, Giarratano told me, the more that risk decreases.</p>
<p>India, however, for its population of 1.3 billion people, has just <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6482705/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>9,000 psychiatrists and 1,000 psychologists</u></a>. In the face of this challenge, community health-care workers like Magdum and Kamble have devised ad hoc solutions.</p>
<p>What India lacks in licensed medical practitioners, it somewhat makes up for in community-based health programs. India has over a <a href="https://pib.gov.in/Pressreleaseshare.aspx?PRID=1606212" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>million</u></a> all-women community health-care workers, known as Accredited Social Health Activists, or ASHAs, who make public health care accessible. Appointed for every 1,000 people from the same village, they are responsible for at least 70 health-care tasks, including providing ante- and postnatal care and ensuring that infants and children are vaccinated on time. In the past seven years, they have gone beyond their duty to help pregnant women recover from the trauma caused by floods and other climate disasters. </p>
<p>After Jamadar lost her baby, for instance, Kamble began visiting her every three to four days, asking about her problems and listening patiently to the answers, sometimes for several hours. Often, Jamadar spoke of her fear of floods. Kamble started talking to more women and found that they all needed someone to share their frustration and fears with. “In several villages, even today, women aren’t allowed to talk about their stress,” Kamble told me. </p>
<p>She started organizing informal discussions in the community where women including Jamadar could be free to share their trauma — and where Kamble could monitor their stress levels and nutrition. “I knew I wasn’t alone in this, and listening to others gave me confidence that we could recover together,” Jamadar told me. </p>
<p>In April 2024, Jamadar gave birth to a child, Aiza, without complications. “From the start, we did everything right and made sure Jamadar wasn’t stressed,” Kamble told me proudly. </p>
<p>In addition to listening, Kamble also started making a list of where pregnant women could be evacuated safely in case of another flood. She would then check if these places had essential facilities like access to good-quality drinking water and sanitation. ASHAs also started pre-arranging private vehicle transport for pregnant women in case of emergency. </p>
<p>Through lengthy and careful community engagement, the ASHAs have started to compile lists of women they expect to become pregnant well before they actually are. “Three months before someone decides to conceive, we start providing them with iron and folic acid tablets,” Magdum told me. This has helped her reduce the anemia rate in her village by 50%. “Earlier, people didn’t take it seriously, but now everyone inquires beforehand about the tablets,” she said. </p>
<p>None of this has been easy, especially because many ASHAs themselves are victims of recurring floods and have faced tremendous personal losses. The state doesn’t consider them full-time workers, and pays them only an honorarium based on the number of tasks completed. In India’s wealthiest state, Maharashtra, the average income is just 4,000 to 7,000 Indian Rupees, or $48 to $83, per month, and often the payments are delayed. As a result, many ASHAs are forced to double up as farmworkers to make ends meet. </p>
<p>Despite the challenges, ASHAs keep coming up with solutions. “If we stop working in<strong> </strong>such stressful times, how will the health-care system survive?” asked Kamble, who handles around 20 pregnancy cases every year and has counseled over 100 pregnant women since 2017. Since ASHAs are unionized, they often meet to discuss best practices and share their experiences. Today, thousands of ASHAs across India are helping women recover emotionally from the trauma caused by climate change. </p>
<p>“ASHA means hope in several Indian languages,” Kamble said, “and I am proud to bring a smile and hope to several women.” </p>

## Evolution of the ELF object file format

date: 2024-05-28, from: OS News

The ELF object file format is adopted by many UNIX-like operating systems. While I&#8217;ve previously delved into the control structures of ELF and its predecessors, tracing the historical evolution of ELF and its relationship with the System V ABI can be interesting in itself. ↫ MaskRay The article wasn&#8217;t lying. I had no reason to know this &#8211; and I&#8217;m pretty sure most of you didn&#8217;t either &#8211; but it turns out the standards that define ELF got caught up in the legal murkiness and nastiness of UNIX. After the dissolution of the committee governing ELF in 1995, stewardship went from one familiar name to the next, first Novell, then The Santa Cruz Operation, then Caldera which renamed itself to The SCO Group, and eventually ending up at UnXis (now Xinuos) in 2011. In 2015, the last maintainer of ELF left Xinuos, and since then, it&#8217;s been effectively unmaintained. Which is kind of wild, considering ELF is a crucial building block of virtually all UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems today. The article mentions there&#8217;s a neutral Google Group that discusses, among other things, ELF, but that, too, has seen dwindling activity. Still, that group has reached consensus on some changes; changes that are now not reflected in any of the official texts. It&#8217;s a bit of a mess. If you ever wanted to know the status of ELF as a standard, this article&#8217;s for you.

Over 670 people have already been reported dead but experts warn the death toll will rise far higher as rescuers pick through the devastation. Aid workers have also reportedly struggled to reach the affected area with roads blocked and the ground still unstable.</p><h3>2. At least 23 killed by weekend storms in the South</h3><p>Severe storms killed almost two dozen people across the southern United States over Memorial Day weekend and left hundreds of thousands without power. Arkansas <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/memorial-day-weather-deadly-storms-northeast-millions-risk-sever-rcna154151" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a> eight dead, Texas seven, Kentucky five, and Oklahoma two, with the causes of death ranging from falling debris to a weather-induced heart attack.

Highlighting the discrepancies among crediting methodologies and the resulting doubts about the credits’ integrity, the documents are intended to serve as guidance for credit buyers and sellers and will shape how the U.S. government interacts with the market.</p><p>The “voluntary principles” include:</p><p>1. Carbon credits should meet credible standards and represent real decarbonization.</p><p><span></span>2. Credit-generating activities should avoid environmental and social harm.</p><p><span></span>3. Corporate buyers should prioritize credits that reduce emissions from their own value chains.</p><p><span></span>4. Users should publicly disclose the credits they’ve used.</p><p><span></span>5.

Policymakers and market participants should work to make the market more efficient and cheaper to use.</p><h4>4. EPA denies Alabama coal ash plan</h4><p>The EPA rejected Alabama’s plan to manage its coal waste last week, with federal officials deeming the state proposal “significantly less protective of people and waterways than federal law requires.” The decision comes amid a push from the agency to <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/epa-denies-alabama-coal-ash-program-in-latest-crackdown/" target="_blank"><u>strengthen its oversight</u></a> of the toxic coal ash stored in ponds and landfills around the country.

The EPA cited “deficiencies in Alabama’s permits with closure requirements for unlined surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring networks, and corrective action (i.e., investigation and clean up) requirements” as reasons for the denial. The Alabama Department of Environmental Management has said it will appeal the decision.</p><h3>5.

Researchers at Harvard University’s school of public health determined that replacing the average diesel school bus in the U.S. with an electric version yields $40,400 per bus in climate benefits and $43,800 per bus in health benefits. The health benefits of replacing particularly old and polluting diesel buses in urban areas could amount to more than $200,000 per bus. But electric buses will still cost schools an estimated $156,000 more over their lifetimes compared to new diesel buses, according to the study. “In a dense urban setting where old diesel buses still comprise most school bus fleets, the savings incurred from electrifying these buses outweigh the costs of replacement,” said Kari Nadeau, a professor of climate and population studies, in a statement.</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p>On Saturday, NASA launched the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-launches-small-climate-satellite-to-study-earths-poles/" target="_blank"><u>first of two small satellites</u></a> that will study heat loss at the poles and collect data that can be used to refine climate models.</p>

## Refurb weekend: Canon Cat

date: 2024-05-28, from: Old Vintage Computer Research

It's the Memorial Day holiday weekend and it's time for a little deferred maintenance, especially on those machines I intend to work on more in the near future. So we'll start with one that's widely considered to be a remarkable cul-de-sac in computing history: the Canon Cat.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEigCC9Ur4NkrG1rdaNqtJ_ymCPmwJsKAtjybV7vRshVQrF7vlqqby6As4zRdq-QwXfaZI6k0gCCNj6FRLR18vkbHDTth90qvVYgX7JD9kxKws0U7_SBcJUTiYL5IaLCJZh7RKgiHMUrHQB61JOIMbtdHOD-2gNlwgnVGgksNd1fuoP7Bh64ulpL7xTi-n4/s3675/cat-m.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="3675" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEigCC9Ur4NkrG1rdaNqtJ_ymCPmwJsKAtjybV7vRshVQrF7vlqqby6As4zRdq-QwXfaZI6k0gCCNj6FRLR18vkbHDTth90qvVYgX7JD9kxKws0U7_SBcJUTiYL5IaLCJZh7RKgiHMUrHQB61JOIMbtdHOD-2gNlwgnVGgksNd1fuoP7Bh64ulpL7xTi-n4/s320/cat-m.jpg"/></a></div>

Many people take a casual glance at this machine and say, "Isn't that an overgrown word processor?" And one could certainly think so, in part because of its keyboard-centric operation, but mostly from the utterly uncomprehending way Canon advertised it in 1987. Canon dubbed the Cat a "<em>work</em> processor" because of its built-in telecommunications, modem and word processor even though Jef Raskin, its designer, had intended it as a "people's computer" that could be inexpensive, accessible and fully functional &mdash; all things he had hoped to accomplish at Apple after first launching the Macintosh project, prior to departing in 1982.
<p>
Canon, however, never fully grasped the concept either. Apart from the tone-deaf marketing, Canon sold the device through their typewriter division and required the display to only show what a daisywheel printer could generate, limiting its potential as a general purpose workstation. There was also an infamous story where Canon engineers added a hard power switch not present in the original prototype, believing its absence to be an oversight &mdash; over Raskin's objections, who intended the machine as an always-on, instantly useable system.<!-- The Humane Interface p.50--> The Cat nevertheless launched at an MSRP of $1495 ($4125 in 2024 dollars) in July that year to many plaudits and design awards, but alleged corporate shenanigans and uncertainty within Canon doomed it internally, causing them to dropkick the product after just six months and 20,000 sales. In the wake of the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash Raskin's investors subsequently pulled the plug and the company closed in 1991.<!-- SOS 1175311-->

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgkP9w_aiGmT5V_w6mZv-tVfcSuiiTta61JKZE0yp1vRAA4f04Im988cdXbhwZxod1qGBYmeWLJRaTmi68dA388KNdIbSHDwXmzd1F8znjRVfvvI1a4H3pidHLCvTfnMp455NUrTZU5C-zuoPG13mn83JXilS9gqV_Cw3XEDeCwZ1JM8iF5wMqBfqv6xHg/s4080/PXL_20240527_155129732~2.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" height="320" data-original-height="4080" data-original-width="3072" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgkP9w_aiGmT5V_w6mZv-tVfcSuiiTta61JKZE0yp1vRAA4f04Im988cdXbhwZxod1qGBYmeWLJRaTmi68dA388KNdIbSHDwXmzd1F8znjRVfvvI1a4H3pidHLCvTfnMp455NUrTZU5C-zuoPG13mn83JXilS9gqV_Cw3XEDeCwZ1JM8iF5wMqBfqv6xHg/s320/PXL_20240527_155129732~2.jpg"/></a></div>

But what was actually under the hood was a unique all-in-one 68000 machine with a bitmapped display and a full Forth environment hidden in its ROM-based, fast-start operating system. There's no hard disk, just a single 3.5" floppy drive to save your documents and the current Forth dictionary. Although the default mode is the built-in word processor, its tForth ("token-threaded Forth") dialect was easily unlockable and Information Appliance, Inc., Raskin's company that produced the Cat and licensed it to Canon, published substantial documentation on how to enable and program in it.
<p>
We'll have more to say about that <a href="/search/label/canon">in a future entry</a> when we get into the guts of the OS. Today, we have two tasks: replace its settings battery and shore up the nearly unobtainium custom Canon floppy drive, its most common point of failure. It's time for a Refurb Weekend.
<p>
<a name='more'></a>
Before we begin the job, let's have a little tour. The Cat's notability is such that there are <a href="http://www.canoncat.net/cat/Cat%20Work%20Processor.pdf">many analyses of it</a> (PDF), including Raskin's own musings in <i>The Humane Machine</i>, and I probably couldn't do justice to it in this particular article. But a brief historical digression is always in order around these parts.
<p>
After Raskin left Apple in 1982, he took his ideas and founded Information Appliance, Inc. in Palo Alto later that year.<!-- SOS 1175311--> "By choosing to focus on computers rather than the tasks we wanted done, we inherited much of the baggage that had accumulated around earlier generations of computers," Raskin wrote in 1986. "It is more a matter of style and operating systems that need elaborate user interfaces to support huge application programs." He envisioned an environment that provided word processing, information retrieval (i.e., search), programming and telecommunications in a single integrated package &mdash; it would do the basic tasks you need and be expandable to the later ones you'd want. This concept was first formalized as the original Swyft project. <a href="https://www.digibarn.com/collections/systems/swyft/index.html">Swyft started</a> as a 6502-based platform which quickly evolved into <a href="https://forum.vcfed.org/index.php?threads/prototype-to-the-canon-cat-the-swyft.12225/#post-174905">a system not unlike the released Cat</a> except for using a 68008 CPU (i.e., a 68000 with an 8-bit data bus and a 1MB addressing range). However, IAI's investors were concerned that its development was taking too long and prevailed upon Raskin's team to commercially surface the technology earlier.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi75oKECaw3Us1Qo6nTMCjSITSmjvqsP1pcMHC_dl3xD2ibV0vjcHxE_nvxUO0SMRaW3XCojCbhGK5zOenPxlGQqQilShg1byCrK8uib93jq-MtdY4Si5DSrUzpw6r_anrhuIgZlTjbFBNj7peBzSbxmP0so0n-GUGh51pUkP-AKpyAARf6Z7N6MuH8TU0/s3300/swyft.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" height="320" data-original-height="3300" data-original-width="2550" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi75oKECaw3Us1Qo6nTMCjSITSmjvqsP1pcMHC_dl3xD2ibV0vjcHxE_nvxUO0SMRaW3XCojCbhGK5zOenPxlGQqQilShg1byCrK8uib93jq-MtdY4Si5DSrUzpw6r_anrhuIgZlTjbFBNj7peBzSbxmP0so0n-GUGh51pUkP-AKpyAARf6Z7N6MuH8TU0/s320/swyft.png"/></a></div>

Thus was developed the SwyftCard, a port of the Swyft's software on a 16K EPROM and some glue logic for bankswitching that went in slot 3 of the Apple IIe. Its sole function was to instantly start the environment when the machine was powered on (no need for booting off floppy). 40K of the IIe's 64K was available as the user's workspace, which was loaded at the start of a session and written out at the end of it. The SwyftCard did not interfere with booting most regular Apple II software and could bank itself out without needing to physically remove the card.
<p>
Like the Swyft, the SwyftCard came up in a word processor mode as its default interface in which you could immediately type and print text. The workspace stored everything centrally: data from any source, even serial telecommunications such as a modem call, went right into the document too (you could even dial up a Swyft system if it had an auto-answer modem and send it text remotely). The workspace was one big document, subdivided into smaller ones which could be printed, edited or erased individually &mdash; which is to say, there was no file system at all. To switch workspaces, you just switched floppies, and the software kept track of whether the current document workspace matched the disk in the drive. The Swyft's most notable innovation was the concept of "leaping," where you held a "leap" key down and typed in the phrase you were looking for, and special attention was paid to making this unique means of workspace navigation as fast as possible. For the SwyftCard, this was implemented with the two Apple keys.
<p>
Porting from the Swyft was relatively straightforward since much of the high-level operating system was written in Forth, a language well-established on the 6502 as well, though the 6502's smaller 64K addressing space mandated using the banking logic on the card for memory management. However, a notable difference from Swyft was that SwyftCard users programmed it in good old Applesoft BASIC. You could type a BASIC program directly into the editor, highlight it, and then have it execute &mdash; and the output went into your document. This was an easy way to do calculations, for example, but most any appropriate BASIC operation would work such as string variables for templates and frequently used text. IAI offered the entire package in 1985 for $89.95 (in 2024 about $260) with the SwyftCard, a tutorial disk and a ProDOS interchange utility, and won strong reviews from Apple II magazines at the time. David Thornburg wrote in <i>A+</i> that "[i]t not only outperforms any Apple II word-processing system, but it also lets the Apple //e outperform the Macintosh."
<p>
While the Cat was reportedly developed on time and on budget, IAI's investors remained unhappy with its gestational pace, and refused to invest sufficient capital to allow IAI to sell it under its own name. This forced IAI management to find a willing licensee for the product, and they found it in Japanese electronics manufacturer Canon, who was looking for another way to crack the microcomputer market after years of repeated failures. Raskin's original target price point was $795, but this was again vetoed and the higher price instituted for better margins. Internally the machine is called the Canon V777.

Here's the default editor. The Cat inherits the same interface as the Swyft (and, by descent, the SwyftCard). What's most noticeable is what's not visible: other than a small section at the bottom showing document settings, margins and a free memory gauge, there are no windows or menus of any kind. There's a cursor, but no pointer.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfU6-T4K1YTo9nbOVOGSsOB-4WcOy7-VHEyEGnrPLXXx8y_7FYclvqqxJ7KBLq3XX-V0J8u4QsJ2s7xCHP34t8GtyC8jhLSa3TaRJxFwZ02uZ-4pEvYbfM3NAcgYfWRbGM94aV2FdTIeAyeMzDQYCO-fyGWa2NOScElDqJ70R5PtYwfxvdnQJhpb4U5TQ/s4080/PXL_20240527_154704116.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="3072" data-original-width="4080" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfU6-T4K1YTo9nbOVOGSsOB-4WcOy7-VHEyEGnrPLXXx8y_7FYclvqqxJ7KBLq3XX-V0J8u4QsJ2s7xCHP34t8GtyC8jhLSa3TaRJxFwZ02uZ-4pEvYbfM3NAcgYfWRbGM94aV2FdTIeAyeMzDQYCO-fyGWa2NOScElDqJ70R5PtYwfxvdnQJhpb4U5TQ/s320/PXL_20240527_154704116.jpg"/></a></div>

In fact, there aren't even conventional cursor keys. The Cat has the same "leap" keys as the Swyft and SwyftCard, in a bright but tasteful pink, and they work the same way to jump to portions of the document or into other documents. You can also use them to scroll with the SHIFT key, or move by single letters, sentences or paragraphs. The LEAP keys are also how you highlight text blocks to manipulate by LEAPing to the beginning, LEAPing to the end, and then pressing them together.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi31Hq4WuLq_GI7O6oZMT60SQ2kLyzQ7yaRTp98WNbUYDZZf7lU99rjhY7ASOSxKaz1uUwx_MvMjxpd7B9rFcfrVCke048RURAjsABfu_RyJfU-w0a3LoJ2tYYdgcwgpDlPkBKzbjmakD9OFjjScRgRt7_i8K9fVndXo3W3NX8rB5eAWIpV2r8JF_oX7UU/s4080/PXL_20240527_154825772.NIGHT.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="3072" data-original-width="4080" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi31Hq4WuLq_GI7O6oZMT60SQ2kLyzQ7yaRTp98WNbUYDZZf7lU99rjhY7ASOSxKaz1uUwx_MvMjxpd7B9rFcfrVCke048RURAjsABfu_RyJfU-w0a3LoJ2tYYdgcwgpDlPkBKzbjmakD9OFjjScRgRt7_i8K9fVndXo3W3NX8rB5eAWIpV2r8JF_oX7UU/s320/PXL_20240527_154825772.NIGHT.jpg"/></a></div>

Much, but not all, of the rest of the interface is exposed on blue labels on the front of the keys. These are accessed by USE FRONT, which is basically the Cat's Command key, and even the LEAP keys have special functions with USE FRONT. For some operations you'll keep USE FRONT and other keys down and add others into chords. Raskin was emphatic that the Swyft and Cat should not have modes &mdash; when you release the keys, the operation is over, whatever that ends up meaning.

For everything else, there's built-in online help with the EXPLAIN key combination (USE FRONT+N). Besides on-demand assistance, the EXPLAIN facility also serves as the "error centre." If the Cat hits an error, you don't get a modal dialogue; instead, it just politely beeps. You can then ask it to explain itself and it will give its objections in prose.

As the Swyft and Cat were independent systems (unlike the SwyftCard), they're Forth through and through, and via a hidden setting you can program in it (or in 68000 assembly). Like most Forth environments of the day, Forth didn't run under an operating system; Forth <em>was</em> the operating system. The particular dialect on the Cat is tForth, for "token-threaded" Forth, which instead of storing direct execution addresses for each instruction in a Forth word executes using smaller tokens which are looked up instead. This exchanges the cost of an indirect lookup in a table for substantially greater code density.
<p>
Canon did not mention its programming capability in their user documentation, but IAI discussed it at length in their own documents, as the "secret" programmer's setting was never intended to be truly secret. When Forth is enabled, you can either type in Forth words at a traditional <tt>ok</tt> prompt, or you can type Forth code into your document, highlight it and execute it (USE FRONT+ANSWER). When running code this way, any output appears in your document.

The Cat also featured a reasonable amount of I/O. There's a DB-25 RS-232 port, RJ-11 jacks for modem and phone handset (optional), a Centronics-style printer port and a small recessed push button switch which starts diagnostics if depressed (with a pin or some such) at power on.
<p>
I'll have a lot more to say about Forth and the Cat's operating system in <a href="/search/label/canon">the upcoming entry</a>. Let's get inside.

The pan is now loose. With a little gentle tugging with a nylon spudger or some such, you should be able to free the lip on the side <em>opposite</em> the rear ports and get it lifted up slightly.

Doing so carefully because there are still cables attached, slide the ports out from their openings on the back.

The logic board is attached to the top case by three cables: a white flat ribbon to the keyboard, a 20-pin ribbon to the floppy disk, and power and video lines to the CRT. Gently pull out the end of the white ribbon from the keyboard. You should be able to get enough play in the floppy disk and power cables to pull the board up and to the side. We're going to pull off those cables shortly but if you're just replacing the battery for the settings RAM, you only need to disconnect the keyboard.

Lay the logic board flat and remove the screws holding the Faraday cage on. If you have chosen not to disconnect the other two cables then you can't remove the cage completely, but with care you'll be able to elevate and rotate it enough for the next step.

The logic board. For some reason some of the silkscreened board identifiers on this unit were blacked out with a marker (I didn't do that). The rear ports in this view are west (left). In addition to the serial, printer and phone ports, there is a small switch SW1 not accessible from the rear panel with "T"erminal and "H"ost settings for the serial port; it should normally be set to "H"ost.
<p>
The Cat uses a full 68000 instead of the 68008 of the Swyft (at IC1), which also makes it faster. The 256K system ROM is provided as four 64K EPROMs with coloured labels interleaved to yield the standard 68K big-endian 32-bit long. The 128K ROM at IC6 south of (under) the coloured EPROMs is the spellcheck dictionary, referred to as the SV-ROM. This is the USA/Japan chip; other locales may be at any position of IC6, IC7 or IC8.
<p>
In the northeast (top right) corner is the RAM, each one a Fujitsu MB81464 32K (256Kbit) 150ns DRAM chip, used both as the system memory and partially as the frame buffer. This unit has the default 256K of RAM (eight), with sockets to add another 128K to equal 384K. An upgrade to do some other time. It should be possible to populate the other unsocketed row as well but I'd prefer not to solder on a rare system if I can avoid it.
<p>
The show is primarily run by three custom Canon gate arrays at IC30 (NH4-5001, GA#1), IC13 (NH4-5002, GA#2) and IC31 (NH4-5003, GA#3). GA#1 controls the main system oscillator X1, a "20MHz" (actually 19.968MHz) crystal used directly for RAS, CAS and the video data shift clock, which it divides by four for the CPU's "5MHz" (actually 4.992MHz) clock, and also generates the horizontal and vertical video sync for the CRT. It handles fetching video data from shared RAM which is fed into GA#2. GA#2 actually emits the pixels to the monitor, as well as handling the watchdog timer (if the CPU doesn't regularly reset this timer, GA#2 will pass it an NMI, and then reset it if necessary), sending the regular keystrobe interrupt (via the 68681 DUART at IC34), and controlling the modem off-hook status. GA#3 handles the printer, keyboard and floppy drive.
<p>
The Motorola MC68681P DUART is a two-port UART. One port handles serial communications from the internal modem and the other port handles either the external RS-232 or the printer port, as configured. It also manages the beeper at "BZ" and is a source of two IRQs, the keystrobe interrupt from GA#2 (keyscan is done every 6.5ms), and when a telephone ring is detected by the modem. It takes a 3.6864MHz clock provided by GA#1; earlier board revisions had a discrete crystal for this located where the large trace is northeast of the DUART.
<p>
The modem hardware is logically in the southwest (bottom left) corner, closest to the phone jacks. The major chips here are the AMI S35213 at IC37, a Bell 212A 300/1200bps modem-on-a-chip, an AMI S2579 DTMF touch tone generator at IC40 and the AMI S35212A Bell 212/V.22 modem filter at IC38. The S35213 is clocked by the 2.4576MHz crystal at X3 and the S2579 is clocked by the 3.579545MHz crystal at X4. The modem feeds into the DUART.
<p>
The "ROM" at IC11 is actually an 8K 150ns static RAM, an NEC D4364C with specific support for battery backup. The service manual calls this the SV-RAM. This is what the CR2032 battery powers at the southeast (lower right) corner. It's dead, of course, so with a little gentle levering we pop it out with the nylon spudger and replace it.

To get into the top case, we'll now need to free the CPU board from the other two connectors, so once we've replaced the battery and put back on the Faraday cage, we'll disconnect the mainboard completely. These connectors, fortunately, are keyed.

Now to get at the floppy drive. We remove two screws from the back and two screws under the handle, and pull the back cover off.

The floppy drive bracket is secured to the side of the CRT cage with four mounting screws. If you have a slim enough 90-degree screwdriver, you <em>might</em> be able to just get the floppy drive unscrewed directly. Mine isn't thin enough, so I had to take out the bracket first.

The bracket is secured in three locations like a triangle. This is the triangle's "apex." In this view, it is the bottommost screw sitting on that tab. It was very difficult to extract, very easy to strip and just as hard to tighten. You may have to work on it for awhile to get it and the tab it's bolting to the CRT cage free.

The other two are easier. They are the two screws on either side of the bracket's tab (not the third, lower one on the right). You've already disconnected the floppy drive by unplugging it from the motherboard, so the bracket can come straight out. Unscrew those four mounting screws on the bracket and pull out the floppy drive.

There it is, the notorious Canon MD-3301. Just leave the cable connected. This is a custom drive by Canon known only to have been used in the Cat. It has a 20-pin interface instead of the regular 34-pin PC floppy interface, though with some logic and cabling it is possible to use a regular PC 3.5" floppy drive in it.
<p>
This unit fortunately still works, so what we're going to do next is a little preventive maintenance (other than the usual inspection, cleaning, etc.).

There are two tiny little screws on each side holding on the metal cover. Once removed, this side goes <em>down</em> to take the cover off.

I'm fortunate to have a drive still in very good condition. A close inspection showed no obvious damage.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiajDBTLtT0tMn1PqVK0IFGfa9I-VA8Ewm29i_7ZjiXEne82jsPjhfKk-uGlFGjtPubVGVIXzMEJfQUKlEMleyoSNfMCQNMViGeDzOqWCG-XPQ_R-_3nNtCzN3rwxG82K1OrlaNd_M8XjXznPpfyqQLIDRsrx_NKuMqavEmgJtzTwqDLulidCV6ptlSsNc/s4080/PXL_20240524_215515804.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="3072" data-original-width="4080" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiajDBTLtT0tMn1PqVK0IFGfa9I-VA8Ewm29i_7ZjiXEne82jsPjhfKk-uGlFGjtPubVGVIXzMEJfQUKlEMleyoSNfMCQNMViGeDzOqWCG-XPQ_R-_3nNtCzN3rwxG82K1OrlaNd_M8XjXznPpfyqQLIDRsrx_NKuMqavEmgJtzTwqDLulidCV6ptlSsNc/s320/PXL_20240524_215515804.jpg"/></a></div>

The problem that occurs with this drive has to do with the head's guide rail. (This section is with thanks to Dwight Elvey, the unofficial "godfather" of the Canon Cat.) In this view the head is the white square with the black line through the middle, and the rail it rides on is the metal post to the east (right) of it. This is a 2x enlargement, so the head is actually a fairly small part.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEilwNn6gvyPHJB37iUUZJDE8GfyedrJUjeh53oZDMMRt2cCG6Yd8rzP1q1yHQLLrpu8eXQ8o5v18ZHtF6m4vEpCMawcC3eq2YAKyklMLCCS55i_7tX11Qt-1Rc5gon_uzqwG9qJRvi7rCGK-pH_LmCyVC_f9KykuzZy4Rbck-XaMPtCOyro8PWUU8VJnJk/s4080/PXL_20240524_215429360.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" height="320" data-original-height="4080" data-original-width="3072" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEilwNn6gvyPHJB37iUUZJDE8GfyedrJUjeh53oZDMMRt2cCG6Yd8rzP1q1yHQLLrpu8eXQ8o5v18ZHtF6m4vEpCMawcC3eq2YAKyklMLCCS55i_7tX11Qt-1Rc5gon_uzqwG9qJRvi7rCGK-pH_LmCyVC_f9KykuzZy4Rbck-XaMPtCOyro8PWUU8VJnJk/s320/PXL_20240524_215429360.jpg"/></a></div>

The guide rail extends towards the back of the unit where the cable is. If you draw an imaginary line between the silkscreened backwards "20" and "21" digits on the PCB, you can see the other end of that same rod. This photo is 1x, so you're looking for a relatively thin cylinder.
<p>
Along that rod are two white nylon pieces secured by screws. These nylon tabs, in particular the rearmost, serve to clamp down the rod so it can't pop up. These tabs here are luckily in excellent condition, but that isn't the case for many Cat drives where the nylon has degenerated with age. When both tabs either crack or loosen, the rod is no longer held in. Ejecting a disk, even gently, could now cause the head to tilt into the open metal window of the floppy disk and get stuck. Should that happen and you innocently attempt to remove the floppy, you might accidentally end up pulling the head off. Doing so is catastrophic and would be extremely difficult to repair.
<p>
There are several strategies for dealing with this problem. While the middle tab is subject to the same age-related breakdown as the rearmost tab, the drive can survive the middle tab failing as long as the rearmost one is still intact. Unfortunately, the rearmost tab is correspondingly the one under the most mechanical stress. Here, both tabs are in very good shape, so we're going to concentrate on the rear tab, though what you do to the rear tab could also be done to the middle one.
<p>
If the nylon tabs are still holding, then you could reinforce them with something like a very small layer of JBWeld (other kinds of epoxy may not be strong enough), though this is fiddly and you'd better not get the goop anywhere else in the drive. It should also be possible to fashion a similar plastic piece of similar thickness. I don't know if a 3D printed one would have enough strength, so you might consider starting with a solid piece of good quality high-strength polymer and shaving and drilling it to fit.

Or you can do what Canon probably should have done in the first place and back it up with metal. I went to Home Despot and bought a roll of 28-gauge galvanized steel pipe hanger tape which at 0.015" thick (0.38mm) is still thin enough to fit on top of the piece. (It also gave me an excuse to use those metal snips I bought that were just sitting around.)

The nice thing about this particular type of pipe hanger strap (Oatey #33526) is that it has a pre-drilled hole of just about the right size. We'll get out the snips and trim it down.

Secured in position. The screw is not very long, so you can't use a very thick piece of metal here, but there was still enough room to get it attached firmly over the original nylon. I inserted a disk and checked that it fed in and the head stayed clear when it ejected.

Now with the machine reassembled and ready to go, it's time to get into <a href="/search/label/canon">that project I've been meaning to</a>. It boots now, so I'll just leave you with this teaser since I've made some progress on it already:

IAI developed one additional Swyft-family unit, the prototype Swyft Model III. This was supposed to be a portable unit with an external floppy drive, a 640x200 supertwist LCD, 512K of RAM and a 2400bps internal modem. Since it had no hard disk or internal floppy drive, battery life was reputed to be six hours with 8 AA NiCads (longer with alkalines), though the processor wasn't specified. It was never released before IAI closed its doors. While Raskin retained the patents and even tried resurrecting the concept in software with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080119202912/http://rchi.raskincenter.org/index.php?title=Home">the Archy environment</a>, no one ever developed a full system like it again. Raskin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/28/business/jef-raskin-61-developer-of-apple-macintosh-is-dead.html">died of pancreatic cancer in 2005</a> at the age of 61.
