<h2 id="mozilla-integrating-ai-chatbots-into-firefox">Mozilla
integrating AI chatbots into Firefox</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>Mozilla has announced it’s adding easy access to tool like ChatGPT,
Gemini, and so to Firefox. Whether it’s a local or a cloud-based model,
if you want to use AI, we think you should have the freedom to use (or
not use) the tools that best suit your needs. With that in mind, this
week, we will launch an opt-in experiment offering access to preferred
AI services in Nightly for improved productivity as you browse. Instead
of juggling between tabs or apps for assistance, those who have opted-in
will have the option to access their preferred AI service from the
Firefox sidebar to summarize information, simplify language, or test
their knowledge, all without leaving their current web page.  Our
initial offering will include ChatGPT, Google Gemini, HuggingChat, and
Le Chat Mistral, but we will continue adding AI services that meet our
standards for quality and user experience. ↫ Ian Carmichael My biggest
worry is not so much Mozilla adding these tools to Firefox – other
browsers are doing it, and people clearly want to use them, so it makes
sense for Firefox, too, to integrate them into the browser. No, my
biggest worry is that this is just the first step on the way to the next
major revenue agreement – just as Google is paying Mozilla to be the
default search engine in Firefox, what if OpenAI starts paying to be the
default AI tool in Firefox? Once that happens, I’m afraid a lot of the
verbiage around choice and the ability to easily disable it all is going
to change. I’m still incredibly annoyed by the fact I have to dive into
about:config just to properly remove Pocket, a service I do not use, do
not want, and annoys me by taking up space in my UI. I’m afraid that one
or two years from now, AI integration will be just another complex set
of strings I need to look for in about:config to truly disable it all.
It definitely feels like Firefox is only going to get worse from here on
out, not better, and this AI stuff seems more like an invitation for a
revenue agreement than something well thought-out and useful. We’ll see
where things go from here, but my worries about Firefox’ future are only
growing stronger with Mozilla’s latest moves. As a Linux user, this
makes me worried.</p>

Supreme Court rules for Biden administration in social media dispute
with conservative states</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The Supreme Court on Wednesday sided with the Biden
administration in a dispute with Republican-led states over how far the
federal government can go to combat controversial social media posts on
topics including COVID-19 and election security. </p>
<p>By a 6-3 vote, the justices threw out lower-court rulings that
favored Louisiana, Missouri and other parties in their claims that
officials in the Democratic administration leaned on the social media
platforms to unconstitutionally squelch conservative points of
view. </p>
<p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote for the court that the states and
other parties did not have the legal right, or standing, to sue. </p>
<p>Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas
dissented. </p>
<p>The case is among several before the court this term that affect
social media companies in the context of free speech. In February, the
court heard arguments over Republican-passed laws in Florida and Texas
that prohibit large social media companies from taking down posts
because of the views they express. In March, the court laid out
standards for when public officials can block their social media
followers. </p>
<p>The cases over state laws and the one that was decided Wednesday are
variations on the same theme, complaints that the platforms are
censoring conservative viewpoints. </p>
<p>The states had argued that White House communications staffers, the
surgeon general, the FBI and the U.S. cybersecurity agency are among
those who applied “unrelenting pressure” to coerce changes in online
content on social media platforms. </p>
<p>But the justices appeared broadly skeptical of those claims during
arguments in March and several worried that common interactions between
government officials and the platforms could be affected by a ruling for
the states. </p>
<p>The Biden administration underscored those concerns when it noted
that the government would lose its ability to communicate with the
social media companies about antisemitic and anti-Muslim posts, as well
as on issues of national security, public health and election
integrity. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court had earlier acted to keep the lower-court rulings
on hold. Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas would
have allowed the restrictions on government contacts with the platforms
to go into effect. </p>
<p>Free speech advocates had urged the court to use the case to draw an
appropriate line between the government’s acceptable use of the bully
pulpit and coercive threats to free speech. </p>
<p>A panel of three judges on the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals had ruled earlier that the Biden administration had
probably brought unconstitutional pressure on the media platforms. The
appellate panel said officials cannot attempt to “coerce or
significantly encourage” changes in online content. The panel had
previously narrowed a more sweeping order from a federal judge, who
wanted to include even more government officials and prohibit mere
encouragement of content changes. </p>
<p>The case is Murthy v. Missouri, 23-411.</p>

Is Sending a Conservative Climate Believer to the Senate</h2>

<p>
The United States Senate is almost certainly getting another Republican
who at least thinks climate change is a real problem.
</p>
<p>
Utah Congressman John Curtis, the founder of the Conservative Climate
Caucus, won the Republican primary for Mitt Romney’s Senate seat over a
gaggle of more conservative opponents, including one endorsed by former
president Donald Trump. The primary victory puts Curtis in position to
win the general election in November. (Utah hasn’t elected a Democrat to
the Senate since 1970.)
</p>
<p>
His victory was fueled in part by conservative environmental groups and
donors, who put considerable resources toward his campaign. American
Conservation Coalition Action, which seeks to mobilize young
conservatives around climate, endorsed him, hosted events, knocked on
doors, and spent around $250,000 in support of his candidacy,
<a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/american-conservation-coalition/C00877233/independent-expenditures/2024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according
to OpenSecrets</u></a>. The most substantial support came from Clear
Path Action, another center-right environmental group, which has spent
<a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/outside-spending/detail/2024?cmte=C00608943&tab=targeted_candidates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>almost
$500,000</u></a> so far on Curtis, making up the overwhelming majority
of its spending this cycle. The group’s founder,
<a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?committee_id=C00855064" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Jay
Faison</u></a>, is the biggest donor (to the tune of $2 million) to
Conservatives Values for Utah,
<a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/outside-spending/detail/2024?cmte=C00855064&tab=targeted_candidates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an
outside group that’s spent $5 million to boost Curtis</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
During his four terms in the House, Curtis largely steered clear of
large scale, Democrat-backed climate and energy bills, instead
supporting energy policies that have or could have broad, bipartisan
support. He worked on the legislation that would
<a href="https://curtis.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=3281" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>become
the ADVANCE Act</u></a>, the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/advance-act-nuclear" target="_self"><u>nuclear
regulatory reform bill</u></a> that passed the House and Senate with
huge bipartisan majorities; he’s also a
<a href="https://x.com/RepJohnCurtis/status/1795554909179216350" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>supporter
of geothermal energy</u></a>, and has introduced legislation to ease the
permitting process for new projects. Like all Republicans in Congress,
he voted against the Inflation Reduction Act, and, like most Republicans
in Congress, he also opposed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,
more typically called the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which contained
billions of clean energy funding.
</p>
<p>
Curtis is unlikely to garner support from the mainstream environmental
groups that typically support Democrats, especially considering his
opponent, Caroline Gleich, is an environmental activist. But he has
gotten far more respectful notice than is typical for Republicans.The
Sierra Club’s
<a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/john-curtis-utah-republican-wants-make-climate-change-bipartisan-issue" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>magazine</u></a>
profiled Curtis earlier this year, saying he “would be one of the few —
perhaps the only — Senate Republicans who say that climate action is a
priority.”
</p>
<p>
But Curtis is still unmistakably a Republican. Yes, he attended the
United Nations climate conference in the United Arab Emirates and
<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/un-delegates-circulate-petition-shut-down-us-natural-gas-production-global-climate-summit-kicks-off" target="_blank"><u>told
Fox News</u></a>, “the goal at COP should be to reduce global emissions,
not energy choices;” but afterward,
<a href="https://www.deseret.com/2023/12/12/23997075/john-curtis-conservative-climate-caucus-cop28-fossil-fuels/" target="_blank"><u>he
also told the </u><u><em><em>Deseret News</em></em></u></a>, “you’re not
going to replace [fossil fuels] with windmills and solar farms,’ and “we
need to start having a discussion about the role of fossil fuels in our
clean energy future.”
<a href="https://www.climateone.org/audio/two-voices-climate-will-surprise-you" target="_blank"><u>When
he appeared on the </u><u><em><em>Climate One</em></em></u><u>
podcast</u></a>, he said his interest in climate change derived from “an
innate desire to be good stewards over this earth,” but also insisted
that “it’s been a mistake to focus solely on fossil fuels [as] the
problem here.”
</p>
<p>
It’s unlikely that Curtis will show up in the Senate and
<a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/chairman/newsroom/press/whitehouse-raskin-urge-doj-to-investigate-fossil-fuel-disinformation-" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>demand
investigations of fossil fuel companies</u></a>. More likely, he’ll
continue his efforts to
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/popular-senate-carbon-tariff-bill-gains-house-champions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>respond
to Europe’s carbon border adjustment</u></a> alongside fellow
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/carbon-border-adjustment-manchin-cassidy" target="_self"><u>Republican
Bill Cassidy of Louisiana</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
“Representative Curtis’ thought leadership on environmental issues while
staying true to his conservative values is a major step forward for the
conservative environmental movement. We’re fortunate to have a strong
ally like Representative Curtis in Congress, and we’re excited to
hopefully continue working with him in the Senate to make America the
most prosperous and cleanest country in the world,” ACC Action chief
executive Danielle Butcher Franz told me in an emailed statement.
</p>
<p>
Curtis’ conservative environmentalism has helped him fundraise, but it’s
also been the
<a href="https://www.deseret.com/2024/1/13/24035509/rep-john-curtis-republican-debate-over-climate-change-senate-campaign/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>primary
line of attack</u></a> from his more conservative opponents, who seek to
paint him as too liberal for the conservative state and whose climate
politics are, at best, a misplaced priority, and at worst, at bat signal
for out of state donors. (Faison, Curtis’ biggest supporter, lives in
North Carolina.)
</p>
<p>
Curtis will likely join a small gaggle of Republican Senators who push
policies to support American clean energy while remaining skeptical of
the Democratic Party’s efforts to restrict fossil fuels, including
Cassidy and Alaska Senator

published in the journal <em><em>Nature Geoscience</em></em>. The
researchers said they identified a potential melting process by which
warm seawater makes its way into the gap between the ice and the ground
beneath it, known as the “grounding zone.” This water melts holes in the
ice, allowing more warm water through, creating a feedback loop. “We
find that grounding zone melting displays a ‘tipping point like’
behavior, where a very small change in ocean temperature can cause a
very big increase in grounding zone melting, which would lead to a very
big change in flow of the ice above
it,”<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/25/newly-identified-tipping-point-for-ice-sheets-could-mean-greater-sea-level-rise?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8YNFYnOkwjo-E_wMQPnGB0bNuxTJxggag-_WecfI-1RRhfwx_ysgcoURikssQRzFBLnDkE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
said Alex Bradley</a>, an ice dynamics researcher at the British
Antarctic Survey and lead author of the new paper. Bradley said this
finding could help explain why the ice sheets in Antarctica and
Greenland are melting faster than scientists would expect, and called
for incorporating seawater intrusion into the existing models.

<li>Denmark will become first country in the world to tax farmers for

</h3>
<p>
In a world first, Denmark will start taxing farmers for the methane
their livestock emit. Methane is a very potent greenhouse gas, and
livestock are a major source of emissions because ruminant animals like
cows belch the stuff. Denmark’s new measure will charge farmers the
equivalent of about $17 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent starting in
2030, increasing to roughly $28 by 2035.

to</a> <em>The Associated Press</em>, a typical Danish cow produces
methane emissions equivalent to 6.6 tons of CO2, so the new tax could
add up to about $112 per year per cow in 2030, jumping to nearly $185
per cow per year by 2035. The hope is that other countries follow
Denmark’s lead and that the tax will “lay the groundwork for a
restructured food industry.”

Congress just passed perhaps its biggest support for zero-carbon energy
since the Inflation Reduction Act. The ADVANCE Act, which the Senate
adopted overwhelmingly last week, aims to keep America at the cutting
edge of the global nuclear industry by cutting regulatory fees, making
it easier for U.S. companies to build nuclear power plants abroad, and
reforming the agency that oversees it all, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Ryan Norman:</strong> The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
has a very well-regarded reputation, around the world partially because
of the way it thinks about layers of different issues.<br/> <br/>
Stepping back for a brief second, when we talk about these relationships
with other countries — I had mentioned that it’s an interagency option,
but it’s also much deeper than financial. There’s a market piece, but
there’s also a long-term relationship that you end up building with the
country because your regulators understand each other. You’ve built a
relationship with the international regulators and the monitoring
agencies. You’re more or less introduced into that relationship by your
partner, so by the U.S,. or by the French, or the Koreans, or whoever it
is. So there’s a long-term relationship of trust that needs to be built
there between those two poles.<br/> <br/> So it’s really important that
you work with a country that has experience mitigating some of these
social issues and working that into the process effectively. Because
when those disputes happen in a partner country, they want to be able to
replicate the discourse process of transparency and all the different
things that the NRC does.<br/><br/> When you think about how that
translates to some of our competitors, countries like Russia and China,
the dynamic of those countries’ regulators in the industry is very
opaque. It’s much closer to the way the NRC’s precursor, the Atomic
Energy Commission, used to operate in the United States, right? There’s
just a lot of issues that those industries in Russia and China aren’t
concerned with. Practically speaking, there’s no such thing as
environmental or energy justice in China, right? Like there’s no
community benefits plan process that they have to go through to build a
new reactor. They have a lot of space. The density is very different.
The authority and the permitting process is so different that they
basically just make a decision and that’s how it goes.<br/> <br/> So
then that means that when you’re basing — when a country, you know, like
a partner like Ghana, for example, is trying to base, okay, how do I
want my regulator to look? Well, if I take the structure they have in
another country that is not used to incorporating social engagement and
understanding around some of these issues, and really mitigating social
backlash, you’re really just replicating a system that is not going to
be as equitable as what you could do if you were a partner with the U.S.
So it’s another reason that U.S. leadership is really an
imperative.<br/> <br/> <strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>And this is what
makes nuclear reactors so different from solar, or onshore wind, or
really any kind of wind or other kinds of energy technologies, I
suppose, is that you’re signing up … You alluded to, like, a 50-year
agreement, basically, between two countries, and you’re pledging a very
long-term integration between those two regulatory states. In between,
for lack of better term, energy-planning elites in those two
countries.<br/> <br/><strong>Norman: </strong>Yeah, they call it the
100-year relationship, and that’s a long time. But it’s super real, and
it’s super important because there’s a lot of influence that comes with
being an energy partner, and you have the ability and I would say even
the responsibility to guide that energy partner to do things responsibly
and do things equitably. And I think that if we want a clean energy
future that is abundant but also just, we can’t just defer leadership in
these spaces to folks who are not focused on these principles.

<h2 id="the-living-computers-museum-finally-isnt">The Living Computers
Museum finally isn’t</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: Old Vintage Computer Research</p>
First off, apologies for a quiet month as I’ve been dealing with family
matters which hopefully are now on a better footing (more articles are
in the hopper). Unfortunately, the same apparently can’t be said for the
once-great Living Computers Museum + Labs in Seattle, established by the
late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and closed in 2020 during the COVID
pandemic after his death,
<a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/seattles-living-computers-museum-logs-off-for-good-as-paul-allen-estate-will-auction-vintage-items/">at
least some of which is going up for auction</a>. The specific pieces
have not yet been announced by Christie’s, but will ostensibly include
<a href="https://www.christies.com/en/stories/gen-one-innovations-from-the-paul-g-allen-collection-1f0df60a726e4dcbabef3a91a57ef7ee#section-mx815mb7Yb">his
personal DECsystem-10</a>, a 1971 KI10 DEC PDP-10 from the MIT AI Lab
which is the first computer he and Bill Gates ever used. (There’s just
something about your first. I still have
<a href="/2024/03/after-41-years-my-first-assembly.html">my actual first
computer</a> too, and with only around 1500 systems built the unit at
the LCM was apparently the exact machine they used also. Here’s a
picture of it from <a href="https://obsolescence.dev/pidp10.html">when
it was in residence</a> at the LCM and used to develop a replica.)
<p>
Obviously, while I think it’s a crying shame, the estate can do what it
likes with its own stuff and I hope the machine, plus the other 149
pieces reportedly to be auctioned off, goes to someone who appreciates
it. (Bill Gates himself perhaps.) What’s more problematic is the people
who donated systems and peripherals with the expectation they would
remain there in some capacity, especially since the museum reportedly
didn’t accept items as long-term loans. (Wikipedia has
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Computers:_Museum_%2B_Labs">a
substantially complete list of those items</a>.) That’s not <i>per
se</i> an unreasonable position, and one that helps protect the museum,
but it’s also one that leaves their prior owners with no firm recourse
for recovery before they get liquidated or scrapped in a situation like
this. Throwing them away is bad enough but if those items also go up for
sale, though doing so <em>may</em> be technically legal depending on how
the transfer was written up, it’s pretty darn sleazy. Allen’s estate,
notably his sister Jody who is the trustee and executrix, would then be
profiting off items donated in good faith on the understanding that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFmhRLiYho0">they would be in a
museum</a>. That’s bad and they should feel bad.
<p>
But then perhaps museums aren’t what they used to be. On <tt>cctalk</tt>
someone mentioned the now defunct? National Museum of Communications in
Irving, TX which downsized in 1998 by taking about five commercial
dumpsters’ worth of radios and other items to the dump. It looks like
<a href="https://www.museumsusa.org/museums/info/15631">one guy ran that
shop</a> and it probably became too large for him to handle, a story
which is probably more common than most of us know, though it’s still
bad news for the equipment that got junked — some of which was almost
certainly rare or irreplaceable, even if specific items themselves
weren’t particularly valuable. Every collector has had well-intentioned
dreams at one time or another of opening our own museums, not realizing
that they turn into massive sinks of time and money and regulatory
filings, and they’re never as much fun to operate as the private
computer room or display case you used to have in your house. Situations
like this should also remind us that donating our own beloved items to
any institution in the hopes they’ll “survive” us is no guarantee
they’ll remain there either.
<p>
<p>We’re amateurs, though. Paul Allen, on the other hand, was not an
amateur and was an incredibly wealthy man who had to have some awareness
of estate planning, and one who knew his cancer was likely to return. It
is widely reputed that the LCM was expensive to run and hard to manage
even with his sizeable fortune and a lot of diligent volunteers. Now his
collection and quite a few artifacts I imagine some folks would like
back are in the hands of his sister, who allegedly doesn’t have any
interest in them other than the price they might fetch. Let that be a
lesson to us that no one and nothing lives forever.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-26, updated: 2024-06-26, from: Oberon A2 at CAS</p>
<p dir="auto">
Hi, I was curious about browsing some of the pre-2000s sources for A2,
particularly to see the history of the X11 interface
<a href="https://gitlab.inf.ethz.ch/felixf/oberon/-/blob/main/source/Unix.X11.Mod#L11">https://gitlab.inf.ethz.ch/felixf/oberon/-/blob/main/source/Unix.X11.Mod#L11</a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">
I tried using <code>git-svn</code> to pull the history from the ETH
hosted SVN server, but it doesn't appear to work unfortunately. I could
try again or take some pointers, but I don't want to blindly mash
against what's meant to be an archive. Maybe the SVN repo could be
dumped to an object storage service as a permanent download? In general
I think it would be illustrative to have a more complete history of the
source code, but I understand if that's not a priority of the faculty.
Thanks!

There will be many chances this week to dissect why two-term New York
Congressman Jamaal Bowman lost his primary to Westchester County
Executive George Latimer,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/nyregion/bowman-latimer-house-new-york.html?smid=url-share" target="_blank">which
<em>The Associated Press</em> called</a> less than an hour after the
polls closed on Tuesday. Post mortems will focus on the financial angle
(the 16th District primary was
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/24/bowman-latimer-primary-israel-race/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
most expensive</u></a> in House history) and, of course, the
Israel-Palestine angle (nearly $15 million alone came from an American
Israel Public Affairs Committee-affiliated super PAC that aggressively

Bowman as antisemitic</u></a>). Others will say it had been
<a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/house/2024/new-york/16/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
forgone conclusion</u></a> and point to the disturbing way Latimer

Republican racial dog-whistles</u></a> in his attacks, or claim Bowman
sabotaged his own chances
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/jamaal-bowman-george-latimer-aipac-israel-zionism-new-york-race.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>by
shifting too far to the left</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
It’s probably still a stretch to say that Bowman’s<strong><i>
</i></strong>resounding loss was a referendum on progressive climate
movements like
<a href="https://www.sunrisemovement.org/endorsement/jamaal-bowman-for-new-yorks-16th-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Sunrise</u></a>,
which attached itself both to Bowman and to the
<a href="https://www.bxtimes.com/bowman-rally-aoc-sanders/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Green
New Deal</u></a>. But look at it the other way around: In the context of
Governor Kathy Hochul’s reneging on
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/kathy-hochul-nyc-congestion-pricing" target="_self"><u>congestion
pricing</u></a> and the state legislature’s
<a href="https://nysfocus.com/2024/04/19/new-york-heat-act-state-budget" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>failure
to pass the NY HEAT Act</u></a>, one of the
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/green-new-deal-backers-in-danger-of-losing-primaries/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>staunchest
allies</u></a> of progressive climate policy losing his election
represents another blow to
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/climate/new-york-california-climate-race.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>New
York’s image</u></a> as a national leader on the issue — and its ability
to remain one.
</p>
<p>
The Sunrise Movement played a pivotal role in Bowman’s 2020 win against
30-year incumbent Eliot Engel — who was, himself, an original co-sponsor
of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal bill. But Bowman, then 44,
represented
<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/16062020/new-york-progressive-establishment-incumbent-eliot-engel-jamaal-bowman/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
fresh face</u></a> for environmentally minded progressives in a district
that once voted more overwhelmingly for Barack Obama
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120218060409/http://www.swingstateproject.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=4161" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>than
any other locality in the county</u></a>. When Bowman ultimately
defeated the then-73-year-old establishment figure, he also became the
first Black representative of
<a href="https://censusreporter.org/profiles/50000US3616-congressional-district-16-ny/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
majority minority district</u></a> that covers the southern half of
Westchester County and the northern lip of the Bronx.
</p>
<p>
In Congress, Bowman’s senior policy advisor
<a href="https://hillheat.news/p/week-climate-hearings-hawaii-climate-youth-win?last_resource_guid=Post%3Af6d3b80c-3a87-471c-9108-62c10fc72ec0&jwt_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWJzY3JpYmVyX2lkIjoiNjlmNmY4ZjItZjhlNy00NzZmLWEzZWUtMmExMjkyMDYzYzg4IiwiZXhwIjoxNzE5NDIyNzY1LCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcC5iZWVoaWl2LmNvbSIsImlhdCI6MTcxOTI0OTk2NX0.ReYGa3JdfaeAkXkEFIB8YyokAFAciEnPNeAQkgEm1qs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reportedly
helped spur</u></a> Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer into action on
the Inflation Reduction Act during the summer of 2022. Somewhat less
gloriously, Bowman became only the 27th member of Congress to be
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/12/08/1218095236/house-censure-rep-jamaal-bowman-fire-alarm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>censured</u></a>
after he pulled a fire alarm in the Capitol during spending bill
negotiations. (He claimed he thought it opened a door.) But his legacy
also includes the pursuit of progressive climate policies, such as the
Sunrise-backed
<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5784?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22Green+New+Deal+for+Public+Schools+Act%22%7D&s=1&r=2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Green
New Deal for Public Schools Act</u></a>, which he’s introduced in each
of the past two congressional sessions and, if passed, would invest $1.6
trillion to reduce emissions and lower environmental justice-related
barriers at public schools. Still, that sort of aggressive public
spending hasn’t always sat right with the powers that be in the
Democratic Party; tellingly, Hillary Clinton
<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/hillary-clinton-george-latimer-endorsement/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>endorsed</u></a>
Bowman’s challenger, Latimer, even as pro-Trumpers
<a href="https://jacobin.com/2024/04/maga-bowman-democrats-latimer-congress" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>poured
money into his campaign</u></a>.

<p>
Fast-forward to 2024, and the Sunrise Movement is
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/sunrise-movement-climate-change-biden-endorse-election-trump-gaza.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>going
through a reckoning</u></a> of its own over whether President Biden’s
climate record outweighs his handling of the crisis in Gaza.
(Ironically, Bowman “probably had the worst politics on the issue of any
Squad member early on in his tenure,” the progressive <em><em>Discourse
Blog</em></em>
<a href="https://www.discourseblog.com/p/of-course-jamaal-bowman-is-right" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
argued</u></a>.)
</p>
<p>
That’s not to say that the climate is “losing” to Middle East policy in
Americans’ hearts and minds, exactly; on the contrary, climate
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/climate-change-voting-elections" target="_self"><u>is
a proven election winner</u></a>, albeit
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/climate-inflation-poll" target="_self"><u>not
always in those words</u></a>. “The NY16 race is a setback for the
climate movement, but it also shows the popularity of our ideas,” Saul
Levin, the campaigns and political director of the Green New Deal
Network, wrote me. “It took the most money in primary history and GOP
donors to buy Green New Deal champion Jamaal Bowman’s seat.”
</p>
<p>
But elections are about, and influenced by, many things, and whatever
the combination of reasons may be, the truth stands that with Bowman’s
defeat, Congress is now down one more progressive climate ally than it
otherwise would have been. (Latimer has called climate change an
“<a href="https://x.com/LatimerforNY/status/1782425052513755604" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>existential
threat</u></a>” but has not foregrounded it as a primary concern.)
</p>
<p>
Bowman’s loss might not sound like much in the bigger picture of the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/8-climate-races-election-2024" target="_self"><u>many
climate elections</u></a> happening this year — including, of course,
the Big One. But if former President Donald Trump manages to take back
the White House this November, every House and Senate seat sympathetic
to the urgent realities of climate change
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>will
matter critically</u></a>. That’s not to say, necessarily, that Latimer
<em><em>won’t</em></em> fight for such causes, but it seems unlikely
he’ll be a leader the way Bowman and other Squad members have been, at
times pushing more centrist Democrats further to the left and to action.
</p>
<p>
So yes, you can draw many conclusions from the 16th District primary —
that it represents the
<a href="https://theprincetonprogressive.com/what-went-wrong-with-the-sunrise-movement/" target="_blank"><u>collapse</u></a>
of the progressive influence of groups like Sunrise; or that, with
Bowman being the first Squad member to lose reelection, it reveals a
growing impatience with
<a href="https://www.axios.com/2021/11/09/aoc-squad-defend-infrastructure-no-vote" target="_blank"><u>absolutist
politics</u></a>; or that big-money interests have finally figured out a
winning strategy in outspending scrappy underdogs; or how all these
things in combination might spell trouble for Biden in a few months. But
a loss is a loss, and it’s the nature of post mortems to leave out the
most important question: What happens next?

transportation official says railroad company interfered with derailment
probe</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>EAST PALESTINE, Ohio — The head of the National Transportation Safety
Board said Tuesday that Norfolk Southern repeatedly tried to interfere
with the agency’s investigation into the derailment in East Palestine,
Ohio, and shape its conclusions about the flawed decision to blow open
five tank cars and burn the vinyl chloride inside. </p>
<p>The NTSB also confirmed at Tuesday’s hearing that the February 2023
derailment was caused by a wheel bearing that video showed was on fire
for 32.19 kilometers (more than 20 miles) beforehand but wasn’t caught
in time by inaccurate trackside detectors. The board also approved more
than two dozen recommendations to prevent similar disasters, including
establishing federal rules for those detectors and the way railroads
respond to them along with reviewing how officials decide whether to
ever conduct a vent and burn again. </p>
<p>More than three dozen freight cars derailed February 3, 2023, on the
outskirts of East Palestine near the Pennsylvania border, including 11
carrying hazardous materials. Some residents were evacuated that night,
but days later more had to leave their homes amid fears of an imminent
explosion. Despite potential health effects, officials intentionally
released and burned toxic vinyl chloride three days after the crash,
sending flames and smoke into the air.</p>

<h2 id="ecuador-ends-visa-free-entry-for-chinese-nationals">Ecuador ends
visa-free entry for Chinese nationals</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Austin, Texas — Ecuador says it will suspend visa-free entry into the
country for Chinese citizens, starting July 1, citing a “worrying”
increase in irregular migration. </p>
<p>Over the past few years, Ecuador has been the starting point for many
of the thousands of Chinese citizens who have decided to take the long
and treacherous journey through South America, Central America and
Mexico to reach the southern U.S. border.</p>
<p>Some who have already migrated to the United States say Ecuador’s
decision and the growing resolve of both Washington and Beijing to stop
the flow of illegal migration is a sign that the door may be closing for
those seeking to “zouxian” or “walk the line” – as the journey is
popularly described in Chinese.</p>
<p>Wang Zhongwei, a 33-year-old Chinese from Anhui, came to the U.S. by
“walking the line” from Ecuador in May 2023. He said that after the
Ecuadorian government’s announcement, “the discussion [among Chinese
illegal immigrants] has been heated, and this has a great impact
[because] more than 80% of the people came through Ecuador.”</p>
<p>According to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol statistics, the monthly
number of encounters for Chinese nationals at the southwestern border
hit a record high of nearly 6,000 in December of 2023. In recent months,
those encounters have started to come down, slipping to just more than
3,600 in May.</p>
<p>In addition to a recent decision by U.S. President Joe Biden to
temporarily restrict asylum eligibility at the U.S.-Mexico border, there
are signs that Washington and Beijing are finding ways or at least
trying to work together on the issue.  </p>
<p>In May, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Associated
Press that Beijing is “willing to maintain dialogue and cooperation with
the United States in the field of immigration enforcement” and accept
the repatriation of people with verified Chinese nationality.</p>
<p>In April, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas told
a congressional hearing that he had “engaged” with his Chinese
counterparts and that China had begun to accept the repatriation of
Chinese immigrants who have no legal basis to stay in the United
States.</p>
<p>VOA emailed the Department of Homeland Security to inquire about
U.S.-Chinese cooperation on the deportation of Chinese nationals but did
not receive a response by the time of publication.</p>
<p>Guo Bin, a Chinese citizen from Guangxi who arrived in the United
States at the end of last year with his 12-year-old daughter, said he
has heard of some Chinese who “walked the line” being deported in Los
Angeles since May.</p>
<p>“There are indeed deportations, and they can be deported on the
spot,” he said.</p>
<p>According to posts from social media influencer Teacher Li, Chinese
authorities recently issued two documents to public prosecutors that
highlight their determination to crack down on those who “walk the line”
and to strengthen border control.</p>
<p>VOA could not independently verify the authenticity of the documents,
but when it asked the Chinese Embassy about the documents the spokesman
did not say they were fabricated.</p>
<p>In an emailed response to questions about the post, Liu Pengyu,
spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. said: “China’s Supreme
Court performs its duty in keeping with the law.”</p>
<p>“On illegal migration, China’s position is clear and consistent,” he
said. “We oppose and firmly combat all forms of illegal migration and
human smuggling.”</p>
<p>Li also said that “China’s law-enforcement agencies are working with
the relevant countries to combat human smuggling and on extradition as
well, in a joint effort to uphold the orderly flow of people across the
countries.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Mexico strengthened its border control by setting
up new checkpoints on major roads and increasing patrols at the more
heavily used crossing points into the U.S. More illegal migrants have
been intercepted as a result. </p>
<p>According to the Washington Office on Latin America, Mexican
immigration forces set a new record for the number of immigrant arrests
in a single month in January and February of this year.</p>
<p>Guo said that he has heard about some Chinese who were intercepted
while crossing Mexico. </p>
<p>“U.S. immigration officers cooperate with the Mexican government and
go deep into central Mexico to intercept immigrants,” he said. </p>
<p>Once Chinese migrants are intercepted, they are sent to southern
Mexico, he said.</p>
<p>If they want to continue “walking the line,” they must start again
from a place farther away from the U.S., which will cost them more money
and time.</p>
<p>Challenges aside, Wang and Guo say there are still ways to make it to
the border. </p>
<p>Wang says the desire of people to leave China is still strong and
that some are exploring new routes. </p>
<p>“You can fly to Cuba, and you can also fly to Bolivia,” Wang
said.</p>
<p>In May, the Cuban government began allowing 90-day visa-free entry
for Chinese citizens. Bolivia allows Chinese citizens holding ordinary
passports to receive tourist visas upon arrival. Those with a transit
visa can stay for 15 days or on a tourist visa for 30 days.</p>
<p>The straight-line distance from Cuba to the southernmost tip of
Florida is about 150 km. The narrow waterway has been a smuggling route
for decades. And some Chinese have already tried, despite the risks.</p>
<p>In October 2023, authorities in Florida say, 11 male and six female
Chinese citizens were arrested after illegally entering Key Largo,
Florida, from Cuba.</p>
<p>Li Xiaosan, a Chinese dissident, arrived in the U.S. in February 2023
by “walking the line.” He says he feels fortunate to be able to start a
new life and sad for others who want to leave China now. Since arriving
in the U.S., Li opened a translation company in New York and has passed
his preliminary hearing for his political asylum application. He also
obtained a work permit.</p>
<p>He says that once Ecuador’s new policy takes effect on July 1, even
if Chinese people use other routes, the chances of successfully reaching
the U.S. and staying will be significantly reduced.</p>
<p>“The door is closed,” Li said, adding that the question now is: “How
many people can squeeze in through the cracks?” </p>

deal with US, WikiLeaks’ Assange pleads guilty, secures freedom, ends
legal fight</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAIPAN, Northern Mariana Islands — WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange
has pleaded guilty to a single felony charge for publishing U.S.
military secrets in a deal with Justice Department prosecutors that
secures his freedom and concludes a drawn-out legal saga that raised
divisive questions about press freedom and national security. </p>
<p>The plea was entered Wednesday morning in federal court in Saipan,
the capital of the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. commonwealth in the
Pacific. He arrived at court shortly before the hearing was to begin and
did not take questions. </p>
<p>Though the deal with prosecutors required him to admit guilt to a
single felony count, it would also permit him to return to his native
Australia without spending any time in an American prison. He had been
jailed in the United Kingdom for the last five years, fighting
extradition to the United States on an Espionage Act indictment that
could have carried a lengthy prison sentence in the event of a
conviction. </p>
<p>The abrupt conclusion enables both sides to claim a degree of
victory, with the Justice Department able to resolve without trial a
case that raised thorny legal issues and that might never have reached a
jury at all given the plodding pace of the extradition process.  </p>
<p>WikiLeaks, the secret-spilling website that Assange founded in 2006,
applauded the announcement of the deal, saying it was grateful for “all
who stood by us, fought for us, and remained utterly committed in the
fight for his freedom.” </p>
<p>The deal, disclosed Monday night in a sparsely detailed Justice
Department letter, represents the latest and presumably final chapter in
a court fight involving the eccentric Australian computer expert who has
been celebrated by supporters as a transparency crusader but lambasted
by national security hawks who insist that his disdain for government
secrecy put lives at risks, and strayed far beyond the bounds of
traditional journalism duties. </p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department agreed to hold the hearing on the remote
island because Assange opposed coming to the continental U.S. and
because it’s near Australia, where he will return. </p>
<p>The guilty plea resolves a criminal case brought by the Trump
administration Justice Department in connection with the receipt and
publication of war logs and diplomatic cables that detailed U.S.
military wrongdoing in Iraq and Afghanistan. Prosecutors alleged that he
conspired with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to
obtain the records and published them without regard to American
national security, including by releasing the names of human sources who
provided information to U.S. forces. </p>
<p>But his activities drew an outpouring of support from press freedom
advocates who heralded his role in bringing to light military conduct
that might otherwise have been concealed from view. Among the files
published by WikiLeaks was a video of a 2007 Apache helicopter attack by
American forces in Baghdad that killed 11 people, including two Reuters
journalists. </p>
<p>The indictment was unsealed in 2019, but Assange’s legal woes long
predated the criminal case and continued well past it. </p>
<p>Weeks after the release of the largest document cache in 2010, a
Swedish prosecutor issued an arrest warrant for Assange based on one
woman’s allegation of rape and another’s allegation of molestation.
Assange has long maintained his innocence, and the investigation was
later dropped. </p>
<p>He presented himself in 2012 to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London,
where he claimed asylum on the grounds of political persecution, and
spent the following seven years in self-exile there, hosting a parade of
celebrity visitors and making periodic appearances from the building’s
balcony to address supporters. </p>
<p>In 2019, his hosts revoked his asylum, allowing British police to
arrest him. He remained locked up for the last five years while the
Justice Department sought to extradite him, in a process that
encountered skepticism from British judges who worried about how Assange
would be treated by the American criminal justice system. </p>
<p>Ultimately, though, the resolution sparing Assange prison time in the
U.S. is a repudiation of sorts of years of ominous warnings by Assange
and his supporters that the American criminal justice system would
expose him to unduly harsh treatment, including potentially the death
penalty — something prosecutors never sought.</p>

<h2 id="of-psion-and-symbian">Of Psion and Symbian</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>As cool as the organizer was, it was extremely limited in pretty much
every way. Psion had got many things right in the first go, as reviewers
were quick to admit, and that made iterating on the design somewhat
easy. The Organiser II CM released in 1986 was built on the Hitachi
HD6303X (Motorola 6803) clocked at 920kHz with 8K RAM and 32K ROM. The
screen was a much improved dot matrix LCD with two lines of sixteen
characters. This version also shipped with a little piezo beeper built
in, and an expansion slot on the top. The expansion slot could allow for
a wired power adapter, a serial cable, a bar code reader, a telephone
dialer, and even a USB port. Given the reputation of the first model for
ruggedness and the coverage of the same quality in the second model,
this particular model sold quite well to companies who needed handheld
computers for inventory and other purposes. The Organizer II XP launched
the same year, and this model had 32K RAM and a backlit screen while
otherwise being the same machine. Given that both of these models had
significantly more RAM than their predecessor, the programming
capabilities were greatly enhanced with a new language, OPL, which was
similar to BASIC. ↫ Bradford Morgan White The Psion Organiser II is the
very root of all mobile computing today. This may seem like hyperbole –
but trust me, it really is. I have an Organiser II LZ64 with a 32k
datapak (memory card), and while it may look like a calculator, this
little machine from 1986 already contains the very skeleton of the
graphical user interface Palm would eventually popularise, and the
iPhone and Android would take to extraordinary heights. Turn on an
Organiser II, and you’re greeted by a home screen with a grid of
applications (no icons, though, of course – just labels) with a selector
you moved around with the cursor keys. Hit the EXE key, and the
application would load up, ready to be used; hit the home button (the ON
key if my memory serves) and it would take you back to the home screen.
This basic paradigm, of a grid of applications as a home screen you
always return to, survives to this day, and is used by billions of
people on their Android and iOS devices, both smartphones and tablets.
People with little to no knowledge of the history of mobile computing –
or people spreading corporate propaganda – often seem to act as if the
release of the iPhone was the big bang of mobile computing, and that it
materialised out of thin air because Steve Jobs alone willed it into
existence. The reality is, though, that there is a direct line from the
early Psion devices, through to Palm OS, the iPhone, and later Android.
There were various dead end branches along the way, too, like the
Newton, like Symbian, like the original Windows PocketPC, and so on –
but that direct line from early Psion to that fancy Pixel 8 Pro or
whatever you have today is solidly visible to anyone without an agenda.
I love my Organiser II. It’s approaching 40 years old now, and it still
works without a single hitch. There’s barely a scratch on it, the
display is bright, the pixels are clear, the characteristic sliding
cover feels as solid today as it did when it rolled off the factory
line. This is where mobile computing began.</p>

id="once-a-rallying-cry-radical-islamic-terrorism-fades-from-trump-rhetoric">Once
a rallying cry, ‘radical Islamic terrorism’ fades from Trump
rhetoric</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — In 2016, Donald Trump’s presidential campaign echoed
with a frequent vow to crush “radical Islamic terrorism.” </p>
<p>Fast forward to today, as he seeks a second chance in the White
House, Trump rarely mentions the phrase, his erstwhile rhetoric about
Islamist terrorism eclipsed by a focus on immigration, crime and other
domestic issues.  </p>
<p>The shift came into sharp relief on Sunday when a coordinated
terrorist assault on a police station, churches and synagogues in
southern Russia left at least 20 people dead. What might once have
prompted a flurry of tweets went unmentioned on Trump’s Truth Social
platform.  </p>
<p>Why the silence on what was once a rallying cry? Experts suggest two
factors: diminished public concern about terrorism and a possible
strategic play for the Muslim American vote. </p>
<p>Brian Levin, an extremism expert who has closely followed Trump’s
rhetoric, said the former president — “more of an opportunist than an
ideologue” — is zeroing in on issues that resonate with voters.   </p>
<p>“Eight years ago, when the threat of foreign-inspired extremism
polled among the top concerns of voters, Trump successfully invoked
terror attacks … to drum up support,” Levin said. “Today, however, Trump
has to pivot somewhat to domestic issues relating to the economy,
democracy, crime and the border as well as the record of an incumbent he
hopes to unseat.” </p>
<p>Defending his record in office, including his handling of southern
border immigration, President Joe Biden has made protecting democracy a
centerpiece of his campaign, casting Trump as a grave threat to the
country.  </p>
<p>But Biden’s staunch support of Israel during its military campaign in
Gaza has angered many Muslim voters, opening a rare opportunity for
Trump, according to experts.  </p>
<p>Gabriel Rubin, a justice studies professor at Montclair State
University, said Trump may be eyeing the Muslim vote in key battleground
states with large Muslim populations that could determine the outcome of
the November election.   </p>
<p>“He has an avenue not to mention [‘radical Islamic terrorism’] too
much,” Rubin, who has written about Trump’s past rhetoric about Muslims
and terrorism, told VOA in an interview. “I think he can win some of
these Midwestern states if he plays his cards right.”  </p>
<p>To be sure, the threat of international terrorism hasn’t vanished. In
the months since the outbreak of conflict in Gaza, U.S. officials,
including FBI Director Christopher Wray, have been sounding the alarm
about an increased potential for terrorist attacks.    </p>
<p>But while the warnings seem to have raised the public’s worries about
terrorism, “overall concern about the issue still doesn’t match the
higher levels of concern it garnered” in 2015 and 2016, according to an
April Gallup report.   </p>
<p>Trump’s 2016 campaign rhetoric — from claiming “Muslims hate us” to
calling for a “complete and total” shutdown of Muslims entering the
country — did not happen in a bubble.  </p>
<p>Though on the run, the Islamic State (IS) still controlled large
swaths of territory in Syria and Iraq and advocated attacking the West.
Adding to Americans’ angst about terrorism were a spate of IS-inspired
terror attacks across Europe and the United States. </p>
<p>In the 12 months leading up to the November election, Trump tweeted
164 times about Islamic State, “radical Islam” and terrorism — nearly
twice as much as he did about border security and immigration, according
to one estimate. </p>
<p>Trump’s vitriolic comments on Muslims and Islam, welcomed by his
supporters, unnerved many in the Muslim community, drawing charges of
Islamophobia against him, which he and his allies reject.   </p>
<p>VOA reached out to the Trump campaign for comment but did not receive
a response. The Biden campaign did not respond to a request for
comment.    </p>
<p>Biden’s stance on terrorism, particularly Islamist terrorism, also
has evolved over the years. </p>
<p>While he is not known to have used the phrase “radical Islamic
terrorism,” in the past he was more willing to employ similar language
while taking a tough stance on terrorism.  </p>
<p>In 2014, as vice president under President Barack Obama, he
criticized Turkey and the United Arab Emirates for supporting jihadi
groups in Syria and “the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other
parts to the world.” He later apologized for the comment. </p>
<p>Since becoming president in 2021, Biden has focused on terrorism more
broadly without singling out any one region or religion, moving away
from the rhetoric of the “War on Terror” of the 2000s.  </p>
<p>On the day he entered the White House, he repealed the Trump
administration’s “Muslim ban,” calling it “a stain on our national
conscience.”</p>
<p>In the wake of the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, moreover,
his administration placed a greater emphasis on domestic terrorism as a
significant threat to homeland security. In 2021, it launched the
first-ever national strategy for countering domestic terrorism. </p>
<p>After the October 7 Hamas attack, Biden condemned the attack as
“pure, unadulterated evil” while putting a distance between the
perpetrators and the broader Muslim community. </p>
<p>“You know, I know many of you in the Muslim American community or the
Arab American community, the Palestinian American community, and so many
others are outraged and hurting, saying to yourselves, ‘Here we go
again,’ with Islamophobia and distrust we saw after 9/11,” Biden said on
October 10.  </p>
<p>Trump is not known for moderating his rhetoric, even while in office.
But after his second year in the White House, the volume of his rhetoric
about Muslims and terrorism fell dramatically as he shifted his focus to
a new area: border security and illegal immigration. </p>
<p>That trend has continued into the current campaign. A VOA examination
of his most recent social media posts and campaign statements found
fewer than 20 references since the start of his reelection campaign,
including only one mention of “radical Islamic terrorists.” </p>
<p>That came last July when he announced that he’d reinstate a travel
ban on several Muslim countries that he imposed during his first term in
office and which Biden later repealed. </p>
<p>“We don’t want people coming into our country that hate us. We want
people that love us,” he told a rally, citing anti-police riots in
France sparked by the killing of a French Moroccan teenager.   </p>
<p>Trump supporters dismiss his rhetoric about Muslims and terrorism as
just that — rhetoric.  </p>
<p>“Let’s forget about what this guy says. Let’s look at what he does,”
a Muslim Republican activist said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.  </p>
<p>Another activist questioned whether Trump has ever said he hates
Muslims, adding that more Muslims will likely vote for the former
president than did in 2016.  </p>
<p>But if there is one thing both Trump supporters and detractors agree
on, it is that Trump will likely follow through on his vow to bring back
the “Muslim ban.”  </p>
<p>“The legal structure that allowed the Muslim ban to be implemented in
the first place is still on the books so we have to start planning as if
a new Muslim ban will come into existence,” said Corey Saylor, research
and advocacy director for the Council on American Islamic Relations.</p>

<h2 id="the-case-for-evs-with-gas-tanks">The Case for EVs with Gas
Tanks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjQ5MzExNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NTU1Njc0N30.wgYt2szpdGd8-Aw9X3RqQmJ1v3DseWpw5wjPkJnJUfY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The American car buyer is a hard one to satisfy.
</p>
<p>
The freedom of the open road is embedded in our consciousness in a way
it is in few (if any) other countries. A typical American consumer may
want to be able to embark on a summer road-trip across the United
States’ vast distances, to cram in a family of five and all their
camping supplies (and maybe a dog and a canoe!), or to hitch up a
trailer to haul a boat or RV wherever they might want to adventure.
</p>
<p>
We may not use all those features most of the time, but we don’t want to
make a major purchase like a car, truck, or SUV to meet the average use
case; if we can afford to, <em><em>we buy for the edge</em></em>
<em><em>case</em></em>.
</p>
<p>
That’s why I can’t stop thinking about a recent announcement made by
Stellantis, the Euro-American conglomerate behind brands like Dodge,
Jeep, Ram and Alfa Romeo.
</p>
<p>
For model year 2025, Stellantis will electrify its full-size Ram 1500
pickup, following in the footsteps of GM and Ford. But unlike its
rivals, Stellantis will offer the Ram 1500 REV in both an all-electric
model (with 350-500 mile range) <em><em>and</em></em>
<a href="https://www.ramtrucks.com/electric/ram-1500-ramcharger.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
“range extender” Ramcharger 1500</u></a> that features around 140 miles
of electric range — <em><em>plus a V6 engine </em></em>mated to a
generator to power the vehicle when the battery is depleted.
</p>
<p>
I think it’s brilliant.
</p>
<p>
This kind of range-extended EV seems like the ideal near-term product to
satisfy some of the trickiest American market segments to electrify:
namely the uniquely American demand for full-size pickups and massive
SUVs.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-12-q1-ev-sales" target="_self"><u>I’ve
been a critic</u></a> of plug-in hybrid vehicles as a bridge to an
electrified future in the past. But I’ve leveled that critique against
the popular “parallel” plug-in hybrid architecture, which features both
a conventional internal combustion engine and mechanical transmission
<em><em>plus </em></em>a battery and electric motor/generator.
</p>
<p>
Despite Toyota’s reputation for hybrids, Stellantis is actually the
undisputed king of plug-in hybrids in the U.S. already, with plug-in
hybrid versions of popular models like the Jeep Wrangler and Cherokee
and the Chrysler Pacifica minivan
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-12-q1-ev-sales" target="_self"><u>selling
at a record pace in recent months</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
While this common plug-in hybrid architecture could be right for many
Americans reluctant to fully electrify (especially those without access
to dedicated Level 2 charging), they suffer from one big drawback: they
carry around the full drive train — <em><em>and all the baggage and cost
</em></em>— of both a conventional gas-burning vehicle <em><em>and
</em></em>a full battery EV. Duplicate drivetrains means they’ll never
be cheaper than a pure internal-combustion or electric car. And with
limited space on board to cram in a big battery, these vehicles sport
<a href="https://www.jdpower.com/cars/shopping-guides/mainstream-phevs-with-the-longest-electric-only-range" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
modest 20-40 mile</u></a> all-electric range.
</p>
<p>
(Listen to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-12-q1-ev-sales" target="_self"><u>this
recent episode of </u><u><em><em>Shift Key</em></em></u></a><em>
</em>for more on my problems with plug-ins and a discussion of recent
U.S. electrified vehicle trends)
</p>
<p>
In contrast, a “range-extended EV” or “series” plug-in hybrid (or
whatever we start calling this other third thing) like the new
Ramcharger is a fully electric-drive vehicle. There’s no mechanical
transmission to power the wheels. It simply has a compact gasoline
engine, tuned to run at a single, most-efficient speed, married to a
generator that can produce electricity to run the electric motors when
the battery is depleted.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to the extended range provided by the gasoline generator, these
vehicles can drop battery mass and cost, squeeze in a gasoline engine
and fuel tank, and still come out comparable on cost as a pure EV with
substantially longer range than parallel plug-in hybrids.
</p>
<p>
The Ram 1500 EV needs a massive 229 kilowatt-hour (kWh) pack to deliver
an as-advertised 500 mile range. (The 168-kWh battery for the
350-mile-range version is also huge, 85% larger than the pack in my
<em><em>extended range</em></em> Mustang Mach-E which gets about 300
miles range.)
</p>
<p>
In contrast, the Ramcharger has a 92 kWh pack and offers about 145 miles
of all-electric range.
</p>
<p>
The range-extended series hybrid thus sheds 137 kWh of batteries vs. the
500 mile range EV. At about $100+ per kWh to manufacture and assemble
those incremental battery cells, that saves Stellantis at least $14,000
to manufacture the truck. A new V6 engine costs
<a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/automotive/how-much-does-it-cost-to-replace-an-engine.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>about
$5,000-10,000 retail</u></a> and surely much less for an automaker to
manufacture, so swapping batteries for the V6 nets a significant cost
savings.
</p>
<p>
The economics and capabilities of a range-extended EV thus make a lot of
sense, especially for massive vehicles like the full-size trucks and
SUVs so many Americans love. And they squash any concerns about range
anxiety that might give buyers pause — especially those interested in
towing something, which
<a href="https://www.jdpower.com/cars/shopping-guides/how-is-ev-driving-range-impacted-by-towing#:~:text=The%20tests%20yielded%20a%20significant,range%20dropped%20to%2090%20miles." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>decimates</u></a>
the range of the all-electric pickups on the market today.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, more range-extended EVs on the road would reduce
demand for D.C. fast chargers — which are especially
<a href="https://driveelectric.gov/stations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>scarce</u></a>
in the more rural areas of America where the full-size pickup is king.
You can still charge these vehicles at a D.C. fast charger (if you can
find one), but you can also pull into any gas station to extend range on
road trips.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, a 100+ mile electric range is sufficient to cover
<a href="https://evstatistics.com/2021/12/99-2-of-us-daily-trips-are-less-than-100-miles/3/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>around
99%</u></a> of trips taken in personal vehicle in America. Plus, even
when running in generator mode, a series electric drive train with
regenerative braking is more efficient than a pure internal combustion
drive (especially when the internal combustion generator can bypass the
battery to directly power the electric motors, as it can in the
Ramcharger). Near-term adoption of range-extended EVs could deliver
substantial reductions in both emissions and gas use.
</p>
<p>
Sound familiar? That’s because this was exactly how the original Chevy
Volt and BMW i3 range extended option were configured way back in 2011.
Why GM didn’t continue down this path to electrify their massive
Silverados, Sierras, and Escalades is beyond me.
</p>
<p>
Stellantis isn’t the only automaker going down this path. Mazda has
struggled to get a competitive EV out, with their
<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/mazda/mx-30" target="_blank"><u>MX-30
offering a paltry 100-mile range</u></a>. So they’re launching a
range-extended version with a compact 830cc rotary engine (one of
Mazda’s core IPs), which could turn the compact SUV into a truly viable
product. Across the Atlantic, Nissan also
<a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1141336_nissan-e-power-hybrid-tech-might-evolve-for-us-on-the-way-to-evs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>offers
a series hybrid drivetrain</u></a> marketed as
<a href="https://www.nissan-global.com/EN/INNOVATION/TECHNOLOGY/ARCHIVE/E_POWER/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>e-POWER</u></a>
in Europe and the U.K.
</p>
<p>
Building range-extended battery EVs is also a good way for manufacturers
to develop experience with all-electric vehicle architecture and achieve
economies of scale in production. A series hybrid can ride on the same
all-electric platform as a full battery electric variant — as in the
case of the Ram 1500 REV and Ramcharger — which is key to keeping
manufacturing costs low. (Several Chinese automakers took this route.)
In contrast, a parallel plug-in hybrid always shares a platform with its
pure fossil fueled siblings.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the U.S. is embarking on a strategic effort to onshore and
“friend shore” the whole EV battery and critical minerals supply chain.
It’s going to be a serious challenge. Cutting the size of battery packs
in electric full-size pickup and SUVs in half makes that a lot easier.
</p>
<p>
So are range-extended EVs with 100 mile range the electrified vehicle
Americans are waiting for? If they’re demanding big vehicles, towing
capacity, and long-distance travel away from cities and interstates —
e.g. exactly the segments hardest to satisfy with a pure EV — the answer
might be yes.

<h2 id="sham-trial-of-us-journalist-gershkovich-begins-in-russia">‘Sham’
trial of US journalist Gershkovich begins in Russia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — With his head recently shaven, American journalist Evan
Gershkovich appeared briefly in photos taken before his closed-door
trial began on Wednesday in Russia, nearly 15 months after he was jailed
on espionage charges that are widely viewed as baseless and politically
motivated.</p>
<p>A correspondent with The Wall Street Journal, Gershkovich was
detained in March 2023 on spying charges that he, his employer and the
U.S. government vehemently deny. The State Department has also declared
Gershkovich wrongfully detained.</p>
<p>Press freedom experts have said that they expect the trial against
Gershkovich to be a politically motivated sham.</p>
<p>“It’s certainly a sham trial. It’s a travesty of justice. The charges
brought against him are spurious and unsubstantiated, and the whole
thing is just a masquerade,” Gulnoza Said, the Europe and Central Asia
program coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ,
told VOA.</p>
<p>The trial is taking place in Yekaterinburg, where Gershkovich, 32,
was first detained. The Ural Mountains city is about 1,400 kilometers,
or 870 miles, east of Moscow.</p>
<p>Russian authorities have accused Gershkovich of “gathering secret
information” about a Russian tank manufacturer. But to date, Moscow has
not publicly provided any evidence to substantiate the charges against
Gershkovich, who was accredited by Russia’s foreign ministry to work in
the country.</p>
<p>Russia’s Washington embassy did not immediately reply to a VOA email
requesting comment.</p>
<p>Secret trials are common practice in Russia for cases of alleged
treason or espionage involving classified state material. But that means
it will be difficult for observers and watchdogs to monitor the trial,
according to Paul Beckett, an assistant editor at The Journal who is
leading the newspaper’s campaign to secure Gershkovich’s release.</p>
<p>“I don’t have high hopes that we will be able to see much, if
anything, that’s happening there. And I think that just speaks to the
opacity of the whole system and its arbitrariness,” Beckett told
VOA.</p>
<p>It is not clear how long the trial will take, but based on similar
past cases, CPJ’s Said believes it will last a few months. She added
that the trial is likely intended to foster a facade of rule of law in
Russia.</p>
<p>U.S. embassy officials were present at the courthouse and given brief
access before the proceedings began, the diplomatic mission in Moscow
said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>According to the court, the next hearing has been scheduled for
August 13, Daniel Kanigan, the spokesperson of the U.S. embassy, told
VOA.</p>
<p>Kanigan told VOA on Tuesday that the embassy “will make efforts to
attend any future proceedings.”</p>
<p>“Journalism is not a crime. Evan should not have been detained and
both he and Paul Whelan should be released,” Kanigan added in the
email.</p>
<p>Whelan is a former Marine who is serving a 16-year spying sentence in
Russia. The State Department has also declared him wrongfully
detained.</p>
<p>If convicted, Gershkovich faces up to 20 years behind bars.</p>
<p>Some press freedom experts believe a conviction — regardless of its
illegitimacy — is a necessary yet imperfect step to eventually securing
Gershkovich’s release through a prisoner swap.</p>
<p>“They’re trying to kill two birds with one stone. One is to silence
Evan,” Said told VOA. “The second goal is, obviously, to get him
exchanged for someone who is important for the Kremlin and for [Russian
President Vladimir] Putin.”</p>
<p>Putin has previously indicated that the Kremlin would be willing to
trade Gershkovich for a convicted killer jailed in Germany. Prisoner
swap negotiations between Moscow and Washington have been taking place
for months.</p>
<p>Although Beckett said a conviction is likely, he added that he hopes
the U.S. government can find a way to “short-circuit” the trial process
and secure Gershkovich’s release as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“It’s high time that the U.S. government reached a settlement with
Russia over how to get Evan, and other Americans wrongfully detained in
Russia, back home and back to their families,” said Beckett, who is
based in Washington.</p>
<p>In a Wednesday statement, Gershkovich’s family also urged the U.S.
government to do everything it can to secure the reporter’s release.</p>
<p>“These past 15 months have been extraordinarily painful for Evan and
for our family. We miss our son and just want him home,” they said in
the statement. “We’re deeply disappointed that he will have to endure
further attempts to discredit him and to paint a picture that is
unrecognizable to anyone who knows him.”</p>
<p>Gershkovich’s case underscores the poor state of press freedom in
Russia, according to media experts. At the end of 2023, the CPJ in New
York documented the jailings of 22 journalists in Russia, including 12
foreign nationals.</p>
<p>“The Kremlin has clamped down severely on independent reporting,
effectively turning journalism into a crime,” The Journal’s
editor-in-chief, Emma Tucker, wrote in a Tuesday open letter on
Gershkovich’s trial.</p>
<p>Gershkovich is one of two American journalists currently jailed in
Russia.</p>
<p>Alsu Kurmasheva, a U.S.-Russian national who works at VOA’s sister
outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in Prague, has been jailed since
October 2023 on charges of failing to self-register as a “foreign agent”
and spreading what the Kremlin views as false information about the
Russian army.</p>
<p>Kurmasheva, 47, rejects the charges, which carry a combined sentence
of 15 years in prison. The U.S. government has also called for her
immediate release.</p>

Microsoft has pretty much stopped making smartphones. Again. But before
the company discontinued its Surface Duo line of dual-screen phones,
Microsoft had allegedly begun work on a “Surface Duo 3” that would have
had a foldable display rather than two separate screens. While that’s
hardly a revolutionary idea these days, it would have been a […]

Gaza pier, US troops confront waves, destruction and aid backlog</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Trident Pier, off Gaza Coast — Baking under the summer sun, U.S.
troops find shelter in containers stationed on what is known as the
“parking lot” of a floating pier in the Mediterranean Sea that aims to
boost the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.  </p>
<p>Just over the horizon, destroyed buildings and thick black smoke can
be seen rising in the enclave of 2.3 million people, more than eight
months into a war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas.</p>
<p>Reuters was given rare access to the pier on Tuesday and saw aid
pallets being moved from a vessel onto the 370-meter-long pier as it
bobbed around with the incoming waves. The pallets were then taken by
trucks to the coast.  </p>
<p>For U.S. Army Sergeant Ibrahim Barry, who is a forklift operator on
the pier, the operation is personal. Barry, who is Muslim, was in the
U.S. when war broke out and watched as families in Gaza during Ramadan
in March and April had no food with which to break their fast.  </p>
<p>“Being in this mission [is] on a personal level for me,” he said.
“Helping to help them get food … just taking care of people.”</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden announced in March the plan to put the pier
in place for aid deliveries as famine loomed in Gaza. As of Tuesday,
8,332 pallets had been delivered via the pier.  </p>
<p>But nearly 6,900 pallets of those have just been sitting on Gaza’s
coast, in a marshaling area, waiting to be picked up by the United
Nations for distribution. The World Food Program paused deliveries
earlier this month over security concerns.  </p>
<p>For many troops working on pier operations, this is their first
combat zone. But not for Captain Joel Stewart, commander of Naval Beach
group 1.</p>
<p>“War is a terrible thing. I don’t care where it is. I don’t care what
it is. It is destruction. It is never pretty. It is certainly not
something that I ever want to see again,” Stewart said while standing on
the pier.  </p>
<p>“The sailors, marines, merchant men, soldiers are all behind this
mission because they see they are making a difference for the people of
Gaza,” Stewart said.  </p>
<p>The pier’s usage has been paused multiple times because of sea
conditions and at one point was towed to the Israeli port of Ashdod for
repairs.  </p>
<p>A senior U.S. official said on Tuesday the pier may be extended well
beyond its July 31 authorization date if the United States and aid
organizations can get aid flowing again to Palestinians in the coming
days and weeks.</p>

id="judge-allows-trump-to-talk-about-jurors-witnesses-in-hush-money-conviction">Judge
allows Trump to talk about jurors, witnesses in hush money
conviction</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — A judge on Tuesday modified Donald Trump’s gag order,
freeing the former president to comment publicly about witnesses and
jurors in the hush money criminal trial that led to his felony
conviction but keeping others connected to the case off limits at least
until he’s sentenced July 11. </p>
<p>Judge Juan M. Merchan’s ruling — just days before Trump’s debate
Thursday with President Joe Biden — clears the presumptive Republican
nominee to again go on the attack against his former lawyer Michael
Cohen, adult film actor Stormy Daniels and other witnesses. Trump was
convicted May 30 of falsifying records to cover up a potential sex
scandal, making him the first ex-president convicted of a crime. </p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers had urged Merchan to lift the gag order completely,
arguing there was nothing to justify continued restrictions on Trump’s
First Amendment rights after the trial’s conclusion. Trump has said that
the gag order has prevented him from defending himself while Cohen and
Daniels continue to pillory him. </p>
<p>The Manhattan district attorney’s office asked Merchan to keep the
gag order’s ban on comments about jurors, court staffers and the
prosecution team in place at least until Trump is sentenced on July 11
but said last week they would be OK with allowing Trump to comment about
witnesses now that the trial is over. </p>
<p>Trump was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records
arising from what prosecutors said was an attempt to cover up a hush
money payment to Daniels just before the 2016 presidential election. She
claims she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier, which he
denies. </p>
<p>The crime is punishable by up to four years behind bars, but
prosecutors have not said if they would seek incarceration, and it’s
unclear if Merchan would impose such a sentence. Other options include a
fine or probation. </p>
<p>Following his conviction, Trump complained that he was under a “nasty
gag order” while also testing its limits. In remarks a day after his
conviction, Trump referred to Cohen, though not by name, as “a
sleazebag.” </p>
<p>In a subsequent Newsmax interview, Trump took issue with jury and its
makeup, complaining about Manhattan, “It’s a very, very liberal Democrat
area so I knew we were in deep trouble,” and claiming: “I never saw a
glimmer of a smile from the jury. No, this was a venue that was very
unfair. A tiny fraction of the people are Republicans.” </p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers, who said they were under the impression the gag
order would end with a verdict, wrote a letter to Merchan on June 4
asking him to lift the order. </p>
<p>Prosecutors urged Merchan to keep the gag order’s ban on comments
about jurors and trial staff in place “at least through the sentencing
hearing and the resolution of any post-trial motions.” They argued that
the judge had “an obligation to protect the integrity of these
proceedings and the fair administration of justice.” </p>
<p>Merchan issued Trump’s gag order on March 26, a few weeks before the
start of the trial, after prosecutors raised concerns about the
presumptive Republican presidential nominee’s propensity to assail
people involved in his cases. </p>
<p>Merchan later expanded it to prohibit comments about his own family
after Trump made social media posts attacking the judge’s daughter, a
Democratic political consultant. The order did not prohibit comments
about Merchan or District Attorney Alvin Bragg, whose office prosecuted
the case. </p>
<p>During the trial, Merchan held Trump in contempt of court, fined him
$10,000 for violating the gag order and threatened to put him in jail if
he did it again. </p>
<p>In seeking to lift the gag order, Trump lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil
Bove argued that Trump was entitled to “unrestrained campaign advocacy”
in light of Biden’s public comments about the verdict, and Cohen and
Daniels’ continued public criticism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“Art is about reaching out. So I think it’s wrong to allow one strata of
society to have the most access.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is an older article, but it resonated with me so much that I wanted
to share it immediately.
</p>
<p>
This is so important, and a sign of what we’ve lost:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“I went [to art school] because the government of the day paid for me to
go and I didn’t have to pay them back. There was a thrusting society
then, a society that tried to improve itself. Yes, of course, it cost
money. But so what? It allowed people from any kind of background to
learn about Shakespeare, or Vermeer.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A culture where only the rich are afforded the space, training, and
platform to make art is missing the voices that make it special.
</p>
<p>
The same goes for other spaces: newsrooms where only the wealthy can
serve as journalists cannot accurately represent the people who depend
on it. Technology without class diversity is myopic. Above all else, a
culture of rich people is boring as hell.
</p>
<p>
Art school - like all school - should be free and available to everyone.
It’s tragic that it’s not. We all lose out, regardless of our
background.

<p>
“I fear that media outlets and other websites, in attempting to”protect”
their material from AI scrapers, will go too far in the anti-human
direction.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’ve been struggling with this.
</p>
<p>
I’m not in favor of the 404 Media approach, which is to stick an auth
wall in front of your content, forcing everyone to register before they
can load your article. That isn’t a great experience for anyone, and I
don’t think it’s sustainable for a publisher in the long run.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, I think it’s fair to try and prevent some bot access
at the moment. Adding AI agents to your robots.txt - although, as recent
news has shown, perhaps not as effective a move as it might be - seems
like the right call to me.
</p>
<p>
Clearly an AI agent isn’t a human. For ad hoc queries - where an agent
is retrieving content from a website in direct response to a user query
- it clearly is acting on <em>behalf</em> of a human. Is it a browser,
then? Maybe? If it is, we should just let it through.
</p>
<p>
It’s accessing articles as training data that I really take issue with
(as well as the subterfuge of not always advertising what it is when it
accesses a site). In these cases, content is copied into a corpus in a
manner that’s outside of its licensing, without the author’s knowledge.
That sucks - not because I’m in favor of DRM, but because often the
people whose work is being taken are living on a shoestring, and the
software is run by very large corporations who will make a fortune.
</p>
<p>
But yes: I don’t think auth walls, CAPTCHAs, paywalls, or any added
friction between content and audience are a good idea. These things make
the web worse for everybody.

<h2 id="looking-ahead-to-30-years-of-freedos">Looking ahead to 30 years
of FreeDOS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>In a few days, 29 June, FreeDOS will turn 30. This happens to make it
one of the oldest, continuously active open source projects in the
world, originally created because Jim Hall had heard Microsoft was going
to kill DOS when the upcoming Windows 95 was going to be released. After
seeing the excitement around Linux, he decided it an open source DOS
would be a valuable time investment. I still used DOS, and I didn’t want
to stop using DOS. And I looked at what Linux had achieved: people from
all over the world shared source code with each other to make this full
operating system that worked just like Unix. And I thought “If they can
do that with Linux, surely we can do the same thing with DOS.” I asked
around on a discussion board (called Usenet) if anyone had made an “open
source” DOS, and people said “No, but that’s a good idea .. and you
should do it.” So that’s why I announced on June 29, 1994, that I was
starting a new project to make an open source version of DOS that would
work just like regular DOS. ↫ Jim Hall For an open source implementation
of what was a dead end and now is a dead operating system, FreeDOS has
been remarkably successful. Not only are there countless people using
FreeDOS on retro hardware, it’s also a popular operating system for DOS
gaming and running old DOS applications in virtual machines. On top of
that, many motherboard makers and OEMs use FreeDOS to load firmware
update tools, and some of them even offered FreeDOS as the preinstalled
operating system when buying new hardware. With the ever-increasing
popularity of retrocomputing and gaming, FreeDOS clearly has a bright
future ahead of itself.</p>

charged with EU antitrust violations for bundling Teams</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>The European Commission has informed Microsoft of its preliminary
view that Microsoft has breached EU antitrust rules by tying its
communication and collaboration product Teams to its popular
productivity applications included in its suites for businesses Office
365 and Microsoft 365. ↫ European Commission press release Chalk this
one up in the unsurprising column, too. Teams has infested Office, and
merely by being bundled it’s become a major competitor to Slack, even
though everyone who has to use it seems to absolutely despise Teams with
a shared passion rivaling only Americans’ disgust for US Congress. On a
mildly related note, I’m working with a friend to set up a Matrix server
specifically for OSNews users, so we can have a self-hosted, secure, and
encrypted space to hang out, continue conversations beyond the shelf
life of a news item, suggest interesting stories, point out spelling
mistakes, and so on. It’ll be invite-only at first, with preference
given to Patreons, active commenters, and other people I trust. We
intend to federate, so if everything goes according to plan, you can use
your existing Matrix username and account. I’ll keep y’all posted.</p>

id="us-slaps-sanctions-on-network-it-accuses-of-moving-billions-for-irans-military">US
slaps sanctions on network it accuses of moving billions for Iran’s
military</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on nearly
50 entities and people it accused of moving billions of dollars for
Iran’s military. </p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said those targeted on
Tuesday constitute a “shadow banking network” used by Iran’s Ministry of
Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL) and Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps (IRGC), both of which are under U.S. sanctions. </p>
<p>The network helped the MODAFL and IRGC — which earn money notably
from the sale of oil and petrochemicals — gain access to the
international financial system and process the equivalent of billions of
dollars since 2020, the Treasury said. </p>
<p>The Treasury said the revenue generated by the MODAFL and IRGC
through networks of Iranian exchange houses and foreign cover companies
supported the provision of weapons and funding to Iran’s proxy groups,
including Yemen’s Houthi group, and the transfer of drones to Russia for
use in the war against Ukraine. </p>
<p>Washington has issued rafts of sanctions targeting Iranian drones and
the Houthis, who have been launching drone and missile strikes in
shipping lanes since November in what they say is solidarity with
Palestinians in Israel’s war in Gaza. </p>
<p>“We continue to work with allies and partners, as well as the global
financial industry, to increase vigilance against the movement of funds
supporting terrorism,” Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in
the statement. </p>
<p>Iran’s mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately
comment on the action. </p>
<p>Tuesday’s action targeted dozens of companies in Hong Kong, the
United Arab Emirates and Marshall Islands, as well as Iran and
Turkey-based firms.  </p>
<p>The Treasury said the MODAFL Supply Division uses exchange houses in
Iran that manage numerous cover companies registered in jurisdictions
such as Hong Kong or the UAE to launder revenue, including from oil
sales conducted by Sahara Thunder, which the U.S. imposed sanctions on
in April. </p>
<p>The Treasury at the time accused Sahara Thunder of being a front
company that oversees MODAFL’s commercial activities in support of the
IRGC and Russia’s war in Ukraine, playing a key role in Iran’s design,
development, manufacture and sale of thousands of drones. </p>
<p>The move freezes the U.S. assets of banned companies and individuals,
and generally bars Americans from dealing with them. Those that engage
in certain transactions with them also risk being hit with
sanctions.</p>

<p>
Fascinating! And much needed.
</p>
<p>
I’m curious to learn how this fits into other fundraising efforts, like
the
<a href="https://www.macfound.org/press/press-releases/press-forward-will-award-more-than-500-million-to-revitalize-local-news">$500M
Press Forward initiative for local news</a> that was announced last
year.
</p>
<p>
I do also have a question about whether all this centralized
philanthropy is sustainable. What happens to these newsrooms if the
foundation dollars go away? Are they incentivized to find their own
business and fundraising models, or does this create a kind of
dependence that might be harmful in the long run?
</p>
<p>
My hope, of course, is that these efforts are the shot in the arm that
journalism needs, and that the newsrooms which receive this funding will
be sustainable and enduring. It’s certainly lovely to see the support.

polite words regarding the British General Election on July 4</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>
<img src="https://werd.io/file/667ac8fa7d0f8654ad093fc2/thumb.jpg" alt="Apropos of nothing, here's some lettuce" width="1024" height="576">
</p>
<p>
On July 4th I’ll be on the beautiful Oregon coast, and I plan to have a
bottle of champagne handy. Not so much because of the American
Independence Day — although there’s nothing wrong with celebrating that,
and I’m sure I will — but because of the British election happening on
the same day.
</p>
<p>
It’s been a long fourteen years of the worst government imaginable: a
Conservative Party that brought about the formidable economic and social
own-goal of Brexit, an intellectual blunderbuss to the foot followed by
several subsequent very practical blunderbusses to the crotch, followed
by a succession of the most ineffectual, rotten-souled Prime Ministers
in British history, one of whom famously had less staying power than a
literal salad. It was brought into being by a coalition aided by Nick
Clegg (who has since made a career of putting a shiny face on terrible
things), and then pitifully trumped along in a meandering path fueled by
middling opposition, middle-England small-island nationalism, and the
distant, smarmy memory of Tony Blair and the Iraq War. (Here I mean
lowercase T trump, which means fart, rather than uppercase T Trump,
which means Trump.)
</p>
<p>
I’m not particularly excited about Keir Starmer’s Labour. It seems to be
a sort of 21st century riff on John Major’s Conservative Party of the
mid-nineties, presumably in an effort to reach old-school Conservative
voters who are sick of the Asda own-brand lunacy of the modern
incarnation of their party, knowing that actual left-wing voters have
nowhere else to turn. So this isn’t me hoping for major change from him;
I expect very little to actually happen. But I am absolutely
<em>psyched</em> for the Tories to have their well-heeled posteriors
handed to them and their nannies with a fork and knife, finally. It’s
been a long time coming.
</p>
<p>
If it sounds like it’s personal: yes, it’s personal. I’m a European
citizen who grew up in the UK and left for the US to look after a
parent, assuming I’d just go back afterwards. It didn’t even occur to me
that David Cameron would hold a ham-fisted referendum on European
membership, and it didn’t seem to occur to <em>him</em> that he’d lose
it and the country would vote to leave. (Ham-fisted, of course, is the
way he likes it.) I took it <em>very</em> personally; I <em>still</em>
take it very personally; if this post feels like I’m being unusually
effluviant, please know that I am holding myself back.
</p>
<p>
I’m under no illusions of any major change, even outside of Keir
Starmer’s Primark blandness. All these runts will get cushy jobs as
chairmen of boards and minty after-dinner speakers. Britain is effed to
infinity, and there’s only so much play you can even have within that
framework, particularly considering that nobody seems to want to shift
the Overton window even slightly leftwards. Heaven forbid you protect
the poor and vulnerable and strive to build an inclusive society within
a lasting peace. Still, the catharsis of seeing those cordyceps
zombie-suits roundly voted away from the nominal seat of power, even if
their ilk will continue to be the effective ruling class for evermore,
will give me <em>some</em> superficial glee. So, champagne.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and I’m excited to see Nigel Farage get his, too.
</p>
<p>
Now, back to technology and stuff.

But wait, there’s more! On Monday, the court agreed to take up a case
that could determine whether federal agencies

transport oil in northeast Utah, which had its approval from the Surface
Transportation Board thrown out by a federal appeals court last year.

Southern California Edison, a California utility, add up to 320
megawatts from the company’s Utah site. California utilities are
mandated by the state energy regulator to buy 1,000 megawatts of
non-weather-dependent power with no greenhouse gas emissions, for which
geothermal fits the bill. The power will start flowing, Fervo said, by
2026 and will be fully up and running by 2028.

The changes aren’t uniform across biomes: Temperate conifer forests and
boreal forests, both of which are prevalent in North America, are among
the hardest hit. A report released last fall by Democrats on the
Senate’s Joint Economic Committee showed the staggering cost of the
fires to the United States. Accounting for damage to timber stocks and
watersheds, smoke damage, lost income, and diminished real estate value
on top of the property and insurance costs, the report found that fires
cost the U.S. as much as $893 billion per year.

<h2 id="ubuntu-24.10-will-default-nvidia-users-to-wayland">Ubuntu 24.10
will default NVIDIA users to Wayland</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>The transition to Wayland is nearing completion for most desktop
Linux users. The most popular desktop Linux distribution in the world,
Ubuntu, has made the call and is switching its NVIDIA users over to
Wayland by default in the upcoming release of Ubuntu 24.10. The
proprietary NVIDIA graphics driver has been the hold-out on Ubuntu in
sticking to the GNOME X.Org session out-of-the-box rather than Wayland
as has been the default for the past several releases when using other
GPUs/drivers. But for Ubuntu 24.10, the plan is to cross that threshold
for NVIDIA now that their official driver has much better Wayland
support and has matured into great shape. Particularly with the upcoming
NVIDIA R555 driver reaching stable very soon, the Wayland support is in
great shape with features like explicit sync ready to use. ↫ Michael
Larabel This is great news for the Linux desktop, as having such a
popular Linux distribution defaulting the users of the most popular
graphics card brand to X.org created a major holdout. None of this
obviously means that Wayland is perfect or that all use cases are
covered – accessibility is an important use case where tooling simply
hasn’t been optimised yet for Wayland, but work is underway – and for
those of us who prefer X.org for a variety of reasons, there are still
countless distributions offering it as a fallback or as the default
option.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-puts-repair-front-and-center">Microsoft puts repair
front and center</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>It seems the success of the Framework laptops, as well the
community’s relentless focus on demanding repairable devices and he
ensuing legislation, are starting to have an impact. It wasn’t that long
ago that Microsoft’s Surface devices were effectively impossible to
repair, but with the brand new Snapdragon X Elite and Pro devices, the
company has made an impressive U-turn, according to iFixIt. Both the new
Surface Laptop and Surface Pro are exceptionally easy to repair, and
take cues from Framework’s hardware. Microsoft’s journey from the
unrepairable Surface Laptop to the highly repairable devices on our
teardown table should drive home the importance of designing for repair.
The ability to create a repairable Surface was always there but the
impetus to design for repairable was missing. I’ll take that as a sign
that Right to Repair advocacy and legislation has begun to bear fruit. ↫
Shahram Mokhtari The new Surface devices contain several affordances to
make opening them up and repairing them easier. They take cues from
Framework in that inside screws and components are clearly labeled to
indicate what type they are and which parts they’re holding in place,
and there’s a QR code that leads to online repair guides, which were
available right away, instead of having to wait months to forever for
those to become accessible. The components are also not layered; in
other words,you don’t need to remove six components just to get to the
SSD, or whatever – some laptops require you to take out the entire
mainboard just to get access to the fans to clean them, which is
bananas. Microsoft technically doesn’t have to do any of this, so it’s
definitely praiseworthy that their hardware department is going the
extra kilometre to make this happen. The fact that even the Surface Pro,
a tablet, can be reasonably opened up and repaired is especially
welcome, since tablets are notoriously difficult to impossible to
repair.</p>

id="us-and-allies-clash-with-tehran-moscow-at-un-security-council">US
and allies clash with Tehran, Moscow at UN Security Council</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>UNITED NATIONS — The United States and its key European allies
clashed with Iran and Russia over Tehran’s expanding nuclear program,
with the U.S. vowing “to use all means necessary to prevent a
nuclear-armed Iran” in a U.N. Security Council meeting Monday.</p>
<p>The U.S., France, Britain and Germany accused Iran of escalating its
nuclear activities far beyond limits it agreed to in a 2015 deal aimed
at preventing Tehran from developing nuclear weapons, and of failing to
cooperate with the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic
Energy Agency.</p>
<p>Iran and Russia accused the U.S. and its allies of continuing to
apply economic sanctions that were supposed to be lifted under the deal
and insisted that Tehran’s nuclear program remains under constant
oversight by the IAEA.</p>
<p>The clashes came at a semi-annual meeting on implementation of the
nuclear deal between Iran and six major countries — the U.S., Russia,
China, Britain, France and Germany — known as the Joint Comprehensive
Plan of Action.</p>
<p>Under the accord, Tehran agreed to limit enrichment of uranium to
levels necessary for the peaceful use of nuclear power in exchange for
the lifting of economic sanctions.</p>
<p>Then-President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the deal in 2018.
Trump said he would negotiate a stronger deal, but that didn’t
happen.</p>
<p>The council meeting followed an IAEA report in late May that Iran has
more than 142 kilograms of uranium enriched up to 60% purity, a
technical step away from weapons-grade level of 90%. The IAEA said this
was an increase of over 20 kilograms from February.</p>
<p>The IAEA also reported on June 13 that its inspectors verified that
Iran has started up new cascades of advanced centrifuges more quickly
enrich uranium and planned to install more.</p>
<p>U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood told the council that the IAEA
reports “show that Iran is determined to expand its nuclear program in
ways that have no credible civilian purpose.”</p>
<p>Wood said the U.S. is prepared to use all means to prevent a
nuclear-armed Iran, but said it remains “fully committed to resolving
international concerns surrounding Iran’s nuclear program through
diplomacy.”</p>
<p>The three Western countries that remain in the JCPOA — France,
Germany and the United Kingdom — issued a joint statement after the
council meeting also leaving the door open for diplomatic efforts “that
ensure Iran never develops a nuclear weapon.”</p>
<p>They said Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium is now 30 times
the JCPOA limit and stressed that Iran committed not to install or
operate any centrifuges for enrichment under the JCPOA.</p>
<p>Their joint statement also noted that “Iranian officials have issued
statements about its capacity to assemble a nuclear weapon.”</p>
<p>Iran’s U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani blamed “the unilateral and
unlawful U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA” and the failure of the three
European parties to the deal “to honor their commitments,” saying it is
“crystal clear” they are responsible for the current non-functioning of
the agreement.</p>
<p>In the face of U.S. and European sanctions, he said, Iran has the
right to halt its commitments under the JCPOA.</p>
<p>Iravani reiterated Iran’s rejection of nuclear weapons, and insisted
its nuclear activities including enrichment are “for peaceful purposes”
and are subject to “robust verification and monitoring” by the IAEA.</p>
<p>The Iranian ambassador strongly endorsed the JCPOA, calling it a
hard-won diplomatic achievement “that effectively averted an undue
crisis.”</p>
<p>“It remains the best option, has no alternative, and its revival is
indeed in the interest of all of its participants,” he said. “Our
remedial measures are reversible if all sanctions are lifted fully and
verifiably.”</p>
<p>But France, Germany and the UK said some of Iran’s nuclear advances
are irreversible.</p>
<p>Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said U.S. promises “to
abandon the policy of maximum pressure on Tehran and to return to the
nuclear deal remained empty words.”</p>
<p>He accused some other JCPOA parties, which he didn’t name, of “doing
everything possible to continuously rock the boat, jettisoning
opportunities for the implementation of the nuclear deal.”</p>
<p>Nebenzia urged the European parties to the agreement and the United
States to return to the negotiating table in Vienna and “demonstrate
their commitment to the objective of restoration of the nuclear
deal.”</p>
<p>EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, the coordinator of the JCPOA,
said the compromise text he put forward two years ago for the U.S. to
return to the JCPOA and for Iran to resume full implementation of the
agreement remains on the table.</p>

id="a-look-at-julian-assange-and-how-the-long-jailed-wikileaks-founder-is-now-on-the-verge-of-freedom">A
look at Julian Assange and how the long-jailed WikiLeaks founder is now
on the verge of freedom</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — News that the U.S. Justice Department has reached a plea
deal that will lead to freedom for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange
brings a stunning culmination to a long-running saga of international
intrigue that spanned multiple continents. Its central character is a
quixotic internet publisher with a profound disdain for government
secrets.</p>
<p>A look at Assange, the case and the latest developments:</p>
<p>Who is Julian Assange?</p>
<p>An Australian editor and publisher, he is best known for having
founded the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks, which gained massive
attention — and notoriety — for the 2010 release of almost half a
million documents relating to the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>His activism made him a cause célèbre among press freedom advocates
who said his work in exposing U.S. military misconduct in foreign
countries made his activities indistinguishable from what traditional
journalists are expected to do as part of their jobs.</p>
<p>But those same actions put him in the crosshairs of American
prosecutors, who released an indictment in 2019 that accused Assange —
holed up at the time in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London — of conspiring
with an Army private to illegally obtain and publish sensitive
government records.</p>
<p>“Julian Assange is no journalist,” John Demers, the then-top Justice
Department national security official, said at the time. “No responsible
actor, journalist or otherwise, would purposely publish the names of
individuals he or she knew to be confidential human sources in war
zones, exposing them to the gravest of dangers.”</p>
<p>What is he accused of?</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s Justice Department accused Assange of
directing former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning in one of the
largest compromises of classified information in U.S. history.</p>
<p>The charges relate to WikiLeaks’ publication of thousands of leaked
military and diplomatic documents, with prosecutors accusing Assange of
helping Manning steal classified diplomatic cables that they say
endangered national security and of conspiring together to crack a
Defense Department password.</p>
<p>Reports from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq published by Assange
included the names of Afghans and Iraqis who provided information to
American and coalition forces, prosecutors said, while the diplomatic
cables he released exposed journalists, religious leaders, human rights
advocates and dissidents in repressive countries.</p>
<p>Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison after being convicted of
violating the Espionage Act and other offenses for leaking classified
government and military documents to WikiLeaks. President Barack Obama
commuted her sentence in 2017, allowing her release after about seven
years behind bars.</p>
<p>Why wasn’t he already in U.S. custody?</p>
<p>Assange has spent the last five years in a British high-security
prison, fighting to avoid extradition to the U.S. and winning favorable
court rulings that have delayed any transfer across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>He was evicted in April 2019 from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London,
where he had sought refuge seven years earlier amid an investigation by
Swedish authorities into claims of sexual misconduct that he has long
denied and that was later dropped. The South American nation revoked the
political asylum following the charges by the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Despite his arrest and imprisonment by British authorities,
extradition efforts by the U.S. had stalled prior to the plea deal.</p>
<p>A U.K. judge in 2021 rejected the U.S. extradition request in 2021 on
the grounds that Assange was likely to kill himself if held under harsh
U.S. prison conditions. Higher courts overturned that decision after
getting assurances from the U.S. about his treatment. The British
government signed an extradition order in June 2022.</p>
<p>Then, last month, two High Court judges ruled that Assange can mount
a new appeal based on arguments about whether he will receive
free-speech protections or be at a disadvantage because he is not a U.S.
citizen. The date of the hearing has yet to be determined.</p>
<p>What will the deal require?</p>
<p>Assange will have to plead guilty to a felony charge under the
Espionage Act of conspiring to unlawfully obtain and disseminate
classified information relating to the national defense of the United
States, according to a Justice Department letter filed in federal
court.</p>
<p>Rather than face the prospect of prison time in the U.S., he is
expected to return to Australia after his plea and sentencing. Those
proceedings are scheduled for Wednesday morning, local time in Saipan,
the largest island in the Northern Mariana Islands.</p>
<p>The hearing is taking place there because of Assange’s opposition to
traveling to the continental U.S. and the court’s proximity to
Australia.</p>
<p>On Monday evening, he left a British prison ahead of a court hearing
expected to result in his release.</p>
<p>Is this case connected to the 2016 election?</p>
<p>It’s not, but beyond his interactions with Manning, Assange is
well-known for the role WikiLeaks played in the 2016 presidential
election, when it released a massive tranche of Democratic emails that
federal prosecutors say were stolen by Russian intelligence
operatives.</p>
<p>The goal, officials have said, was to harm the electoral effort of
Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and boost her Republican challenger
Donald Trump, who famously said during the campaign: “WikiLeaks, I love
WikiLeaks.”</p>
<p>Assange was not charged as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s
investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. But the
investigation nonetheless painted an unflattering role of WikiLeaks in
advancing what prosecutors say was a brazen campaign of Russian election
interference.</p>
<p>Assange denied in a Fox News interview that aired in January 2017
that Russians were the source of the hacked emails, though those denials
are challenged by a 2018 indictment by Mueller of 12 Russian military
intelligence officers.</p>

<p>
I wish this was surprising. Something similar seems to have gone on in
every trusted facet of American life: from cell phone providers to
online library platforms to license plate readers on the roads. It’s all
part of an Overton window shift into pervasive surveillance that has
been ongoing for decades.

<p>
Senator Ron Wyden is right to be blunt:

“These new statistics show that thousands of Americans are subjected to

Assange lands in Saipan before guilty plea in deal with US securing his
freedom</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAIPAN, Northern Mariana Islands — WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange
has arrived in Saipan ahead of an expected guilty plea in a deal with
the U.S. Justice Department that will set him free to return home to
Australia.</p>
<p>The plane carrying the eccentric computer expert and internet
publisher touched down more than two hours before the scheduled start of
a plea hearing, in which he is set to admit to a felony for publishing
U.S. military secrets under a deal that spares him prison time in
America after years spent jailed in the United Kingdom while fighting
extradition to America.</p>
<p>The hearing, taking place in the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S.
commonwealth in the Pacific, is the stunning culmination of the U.S.
government’s yearslong pursuit of the publisher who has been painted
both as a hero and a reckless criminal for exposing hundreds of
thousands of sensitive military documents.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department agreed to hold the hearing on the remote
island because Assange opposed coming to the continental U.S. and
because it’s near Australia, where he will return after he enters his
plea.</p>
<p>The deal — disclosed Monday night in court papers — represents the
final chapter in a more than decade-long legal odyssey over the fate of
Assange, whose hugely popular secret-sharing website made him a cause
célèbre among press freedom advocates who said he acted as a journalist
to expose U.S. military wrongdoing. U.S. prosecutors have said his
actions recklessly put the country’s national security at risk.</p>
<p>Though the deal with prosecutors requires Assange to admit guilt to a
single felony count, it also allows him to avoid spending any time in an
American prison. He will get credit for the five years he has already
spent in a high-security British prison while fighting extradition to
the U.S. to face charges. Before being locked up in London, Assange
spent years hiding out in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to avoid
extradition to Sweden to face allegations of rape and sexual assault,
which he has denied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The abrupt conclusion enables both sides to claim a degree of
success, with the Justice Department able to resolve without trial a
case that raised thorny legal issues and that might never have reached a
jury at all given the plodding pace of the extradition process.</p>
<p>Last month, Assange won the right to appeal an extradition order
after his lawyers argued that the U.S. government provided “blatantly
inadequate” assurances that he would have the same free speech
protections as an American citizen if extradited from Britain.</p>
<p>His wife, Stella Assange, told the BBC from Australia that it had
been “touch and go” over 72 hours whether the deal would go ahead but
she felt “elated” at the news. A lawyer who married the WikiLeaks
founder in prison in 2022, she said details of the agreement would be
made public once the judge had signed off on it.</p>
<p>“He will be a free man once it is signed off by a judge,” she said,
adding that she still didn’t think it was real.</p>
<p>Assange on Monday left the London prison, where he has spent the last
five years, after being granted bail during a secret hearing last week.
He boarded a plane that landed hours later in Bangkok to refuel before
taking off again toward Saipan. A video posted by WikiLeaks on X, showed
Assange staring intently out the window at the blue sky as the plane
headed toward the island.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Imagine. From over 5 years in a small cell in a maximum security
prison. Nearly 14 years detained in the UK. To this,” WikiLeaks wrote.
The top Australian diplomat in the United Kingdom accompanied Assange on
the flight.</p>
<p>The guilty plea resolves a criminal case brought by Republican
President Donald Trump’s administration over the receipt and publication
of war logs and diplomatic cables that detailed U.S. military action in
Iraq and Afghanistan. Prosecutors alleged that Assange conspired with
former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to obtain the records
and published them without regard to American national security,
including by releasing the names of human sources who provided
information to U.S. forces.</p>
<p>Former Vice President Mike Pence called the new arrangement a
“miscarriage of justice,” writing on X that Assange “endangered the
lives of our troops in a time of war and should have been prosecuted to
the fullest extent of the law.”</p>
<p>But Assange’s activities drew an outpouring of support from press
freedom advocates, who heralded his role in bringing to light military
conduct that might otherwise have been concealed from view. Among the
files published by WikiLeaks was a video of a 2007 Apache helicopter
attack by American forces in Baghdad that killed 11 people, including
two Reuters journalists.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Australia for years has been calling on the U.S. government to drop
the case against Assange, arguing there’s a disconnect between the
treatment of Assange and Manning. Then-U.S. President Barack Obama
commuted Manning’s 35-year sentence to seven years, which allowed her
release in 2017.</p>
<p>“Regardless of the views that people have about Mr. Assange’s
activities, the case has dragged on for too long,” said Australian Prime
Minister Anthony Albanese. “There’s nothing to be gained by his
continued incarceration and we want him brought home to Australia.”</p>
<p>Assange took refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in 2012 and
was granted political asylum after courts in England ruled he should be
extradited to Sweden as part of a rape investigation in the Scandinavian
country. He was arrested by British police after Ecuador’s government
withdrew his asylum status in 2019 and then jailed for skipping bail
when he first took shelter inside the embassy.</p>
<p>Although Sweden eventually dropped its sex crimes investigation
because so much time had elapsed, Assange had remained in London’s
high-security Belmarsh Prison during the extradition fight with the
U.S.</p>
<p>Assange made headlines again in 2016 after his website published
Democratic emails that prosecutors say were stolen by Russian
intelligence operatives. He was never charged in special counsel Robert
Mueller’s Russia investigation, but the inquiry laid bare in stark
detail the role that the hacking operation played in interfering in that
year’s election on behalf of Trump.</p>

<h2 id="us-expected-to-announce-150m-in-new-military-aid-for-ukraine">US
expected to announce $150M in new military aid for Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Pentagon — The U.S. is expected to announce a new military aid
package for Ukraine valued at up to $150 million as soon as Tuesday, two
U.S. officials tell VOA.</p>
<p>The package is being provided to Kyiv under the presidential drawdown
authority (PDA), which pulls weapons, ammunition and equipment from U.S.
military stockpiles to fulfill Ukraine’s short-term needs. </p>
<p>One of the officials — who spoke on the condition of anonymity to
discuss the package ahead of its planned announcement — said the latest
round of aid would include munitions for HIMARS and other critical
munitions. It does not include cluster munitions, according to the
official.</p>
<p>Asked whether the aid package includes long-range missiles known as
ATACMS, the official replied, “For operational security reasons, we
aren’t going into further details.”</p>
<p>ATACMS have a range of up to 300 kilometers (about 185 miles) and
nearly double the striking distance of Ukraine’s missiles. </p>
<p>When asked by VOA on June 12 if the United States had provided
Ukraine with more ATACMS since mid-March, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff General C.Q. Brown said, “We’re working through the ATACMS
piece, and we continue to provide that capability through our
PDAs.” </p>
<p>Russia has accused Ukraine of using some of the U.S.-provided ATACMS
in deadly strikes this week inside Crimea, which Russia illegally
annexed in 2014, and in Russia’s Belgorod region bordering Ukraine.</p>
<p>Russia summoned the U.S. ambassador in Moscow on Monday to protest
the use of the missiles.</p>
<p>This week’s aid package for Kyiv will dip into the $61 billion in
Ukraine funding signed into law by President Joe Biden in April.</p>
