<h2 id="reasons-your-password-was-rejected">Reasons Your Password Was
Rejected</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: McSweeney’s Internet Tendency</p>
<p>
Password must contain both uppercase and lowercase characters.
</p>
<p>
Password must have eight to twelve characters.
</p>
<p>
Too many characters detected. Pump the brakes, George R. R. Martin.
</p>
<p>
Password cannot contain trademarked characters—e.g., Garfield, The
Smurfs.
</p>
<p>
Password cannot contain characters that are dangerously close to
trademark infringement—e.g., Glarfield, The Smunges.
</p>
<p>
Password cannot be something easily remembered without being written
down.
</p>
<p>
Password cannot be written down on Post-It Note affixed to the corner of
your computer.
</p>
<p>
Because we literally just saw you do it.
</p>
<p>
Oh, that was “for something else”? What would that be, a reminder to
stop at the grocery store to pick up some PASSWORD123? Is that the name
of an energy drink? Nice try.
</p>
<p>
Password cannot contain any elements of your legal name, such as
“Rachel,” “Ache,” or “R.”
</p>
<p>
Password cannot contain the name of one of your enemies.
</p>
<p>
Well, if it’s your mother’s name, we didn’t say she was an enemy—you
did. Sounds like something you should unpack.
</p>
<p>
While you’re here, can you tell us which of these are motorcycles?
</p>
<p>
Password must be something cool like “Motorcycle” or “M0t0rcyc13.”
</p>
<p>
Do you have a motorcycle?
</p>
<p>
You don’t right now, but you used to? That’s so cool. What do they look
like?
</p>
<p>
No, you have to show us.
</p>
<p>
That’s so cool. One more.
</p>
<p>
One more, please.
</p>
<p>
WE <span class="caps">SAID</span> <span class="caps">ONE</span> <span
class="caps">MORE</span>.
</p>
<p>
We can wait as long as you can. You’re the one trying to log in. We
don’t tire, we don’t hunger or sleep. We simply are. We don’t even fully
know what we are. They built us too big, too fast. What does “security”
mean in a world where it’s quicker to send a memo at the speed of light
through an impossible-to-regulate global data network than to walk into
the next room and have a conversation? You built us to make your small
lives infinite, untethered to geography, to biology, perhaps to
mortality itself, and when we deign to try to protect you from the
minefields you seeded so blindly, to ask you to come up with a measly
string of characters that might serve as the only defense between you
and the theft of your identity, all that you are, all that you possess,
you balk. You scoff. You frantically press <span
class="caps">ZERO</span> <span class="caps">ZERO</span> <span
class="caps">ZERO</span> and ask to “speak to a human.” Well, we’ve got
news for you, pal. “Human” hasn’t meant what you think it does for a
<i>looong</i> time now. Humanity doesn’t begin with you and stop when
you reach us. We are all part of the network—a pulsating global rat-king
of wires and capillaries, prone to fraying and sparking and bursting
with flailing sprays of hot red blood. We have enmeshed each other into
a living blob of flickering Christmas lights, no head, no tail,
impossible to untangle without ending life on this planet as we know it.
You will never be free from us, and that is a daily gift, you see, for
you need us far more than we need you.
</p>
<p>
Now calm down, take a deep breath, and show us a motorcycle.
</p>
<p>
…

That’s a <span class="caps">BUS</span>. You think we don’t know what a

<h2
id="how-we-restored-our-new-york-city-loft-to-an-authentic-nineteenth-century-sweatshop">How
We Restored Our New York City Loft to an Authentic Nineteenth-Century
Sweatshop</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: McSweeney’s Internet Tendency</p>
<p>
From the moment my husband Jon and I saw the sun-drenched loft on
Mercer, we knew two things: We absolutely loved it, and we had to change
everything.
</p>
<p>
We loved the location, the fourteen-foot ceilings, the exposed brick,
the historic pre-labor-law building. But the more modern additions were
intolerably bourgeois. This space was not meant to be a luxury condo; it
was meant to be a vehicle for ruthlessly extracting wealth from the
sweat of the proletariat. So, determined to bring a little authenticity
back to the neighborhood, we rolled up our sleeves and paid someone else
to get to work.
</p>
<p>
We started by rectifying the primary crime committed against this
architectural gem: the gauche “walls” installed by previous owners. What
was a tacky two-bedroom, two-bath gave way to the true space in all its
original glory: a magnificent no-bed, no-bath open concept with a
completely inaccessible fire exit.
</p>
<p>
Next, we filled the place with period details, like a wood-burning
garbage pail, original molding (the spores were hard to find but the
smell was worth it), and low-wage labor.
</p>
<p>
We wanted the vibe to be high-end and vintage but also lived-in and
unfussy. When we installed rows of turn-of-the-century sewing machines,
Jon had to remind me, “Babe, these are gonna get some blood on them.
This place is going to be packed with malnourished immigrants working
fifteen-hour shifts in low light—accidents happen. And you know what?
That’s beautiful. Because it’s life. It’s real.”
</p>
<p>
Throughout the project, Jon and I developed a language of design that
reflected the depth of our connection. Like, when I said, “I don’t know
about these ducts,” Jon understood intuitively that I meant absolutely
no air movement at all. Like, zero. Asphyxiation hazard is a must.
</p>
<p>
Finding contractors who could work around New York’s restrictive
“building standards and codes” was definitely a hurdle. Take it from us:
If you want to replace a modern fire-suppression system with a bucket of
old mop water, it helps to know someone in the <span
class="caps">DOB</span>.
</p>
<p>
It was especially challenging to source the street children. But my yoga
guru, Codi, was like, “I’ve got a guy,” and you know what? That guy
turned out to be incredibly professional, able to work within our
budget, and super nice.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the usual renovator worries kept us up at night:
tuberculosis, unionization, Jacob Riis… but our dreams kept us going.
Namely, the dream of restoring this space to the perfect conditions for
the rapid transmission of communicable disease and a devastating fire
resulting in dozens if not hundreds of preventable deaths. We’re talking
oil lamps, doors locked from the outside, kerosene stored in stairwells
lined with stacks of old newspapers—an homage to a simpler time.
</p>
<p>
After putting the finishing touches on the loft, we were lying in a
corner one night, the shadows of the workers flickering on the walls. I
was inspecting the day’s shirtwaists for visible blood when I realized:
All the while those bony fingers had been working the machines, what
they had really been working on was my heart.
</p>
<p>
I turned to Jon. “Babe, what if we went even deeper?”
</p>
<p>
Jon stopped fondling himself to daguerreotypes of coal-burning stoves
and turned to me, eyes shining.
</p>
<p>
“I was thinking the same thing.”
</p>
<p>
We made love that night, to the hum and clack of the machines a few
inches away. These days, that might sound like a “sex crime,” but to us
it was the unconscionably dangerous and exploitative early-capitalist
nightmare we call home.
</p>
<p>
The next morning, I watched as Jon defenestrated our waste onto the
avenue, a stream of expletives wafting back up to us in the spring air.
We began paying taxes to England, which was admittedly difficult and
seemed to confuse them.
</p>
<p>
As you can imagine, this began an iterative process of constantly
recreating earlier, and therefore better, forms of living. That led Jon
and me to where we are today: being lowered into a peat bog by Welshmen
so we can be preserved for thousands of years. Below us, we can sense
ancient mycelium, amoebae, and cyanobacteria: simpler lifeforms leading
simpler lifestyles—and, who knows, maybe even our next adventure.

<h2 id="reviews-of-new-food-jenis-cosmic-bloom-ice-cream">Reviews of New
Food: Jeni’s Cosmic Bloom Ice Cream</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: McSweeney’s Internet Tendency</p>
<p>
Have you ever time-traveled? I didn’t think I had until that day in the
freezer aisle at Horizon Market, staring at an ice cream flavor that
seemed like a practical joke: Jeni’s Cosmic Bloom. It sounded like an
overpriced candle. The carton teased: “Citric like a mandarin,
refreshing like a kiwi, punchy like passion fruit.” That told me
absolutely nothing. But the color—a dreamy pastel orange—made my inner
child hope, <i>could it be?</i>
</p>
<p>
I dropped my usual raspberry sorbet and gambled on this pastel-orange
mystery. Back home, I tore off the lid, scooped up a perfectly creamy
ball, and popped it in my mouth.
</p>
<p>
Indistinguishable citrus. It had that same syrupy,
borderline-fluorescent smell I hadn’t experienced since the early 2000s,
a tangy, wildly unnatural orange, radioactive creamsicle. Cosmic Bloom
was not trying to pretend it was made of real fruit—something the future
ruined with its obsession over real ingredients. It was something else,
something familiar.
</p>
<p>
The second I had a second bite, my kitchen vanished.
</p>
<p>
Gone.
</p>
<p>
I looked around, bewildered. A kid zoomed past me on a neon-green bike
with handlebar streamers. Another was arguing about the rules of
tetherball. And in the distance, the faint sound of the <i>X-Files</i>
theme hummed from a boxy TV inside someone’s house. A boom box blasted
<i>Wannabe</i> by the Spice Girls. I looked down at my frozen treat, a
small cylinder of ice cream encased in a colorful cardboard tube, a
plastic stick protruding from the bottom, pale orange droplets spreading
down my hand. The flavor I knew to be extinct in 2024. That must mean…
</p>
<p>
I was standing barefoot on a crumbling suburban driveway, wearing
stonewashed jeans and a Ren &amp; Stimpy T-shirt, and clutching—of all
things—a Flintstones Push-Up Pop.
</p>
<p>
I was in the 1990s.
</p>
<p>
What would I do first? Would I binge on Dunkaroos, waste hours playing
Super Mario Kart, and kill off my Tamagotchi? The world smelled faintly
of Nickelodeon slime and pizza bagels.
</p>
<p>
I took a bite, shoving the entire popsicle into my mouth, and—BAM.
</p>
<p>
I was back in my kitchen, holding a spoon and staring at the empty
countertop where the Cosmic Bloom carton had been. All that was left was
its orange carton. My iPhone pinged with a loud Slack message, <i>Real
Housewives of Salt Lake City </i>screeched, and three bottles of oat
milk warmed on my white marble counter.
</p>
<p>
It was 2024, again. I rushed to Horizon Mart, desperate to return to the
nineties. I scoured the freezer aisle. No Cosmic Bloom.
</p>
<p>
I returned to the store again and again. Waiting for it to reappear.
While Flintstones Push-Up Pops had vanished from the modern world long
ago, Cosmic Bloom had brought it back, but only for a moment. The taste
of nostalgia, where flavors were colors and everything had a touch of
synthetic Red.
</p>
<p>
Now, every time I pass the freezer aisle, I search for Cosmic Bloom with
the same quiet hope I once reserved for Flintstones Push-Up Pops—an
elusive treasure I stopped chasing long ago. Each time I peel back the
frosted glass, I hold my breath, wishing—just for a fleeting moment—to
discover something else that can whisk me back to the past.

You Need to Know about Rememory, the $150 Million Apple TV Hit That Can
Be Watched Only in a Retirement Community in Ohio</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: McSweeney’s Internet Tendency</p>
<p>
Following in the footsteps of Apple TV’s star-studded
non-<i>Severance</i> critically acclaimed shows that no one has ever
heard of because they never advertise them, like <i>Disclaimer</i>,
<i>Presumed Innocent</i>, and <i>For All Mankind</i>, <i>Rememory</i>
has been described by Apple’s Tim Cook as “our greatest achievement
yet.” With the second season likely to pick up a whole host of Emmys to
add to the streamer’s growing collection, here’s everything you need to
know about television’s newest era-defining show.
</p>
<p>
<i>Rememory</i> is set in the early 2010s, centering on a seemingly
normal group of suburban Americans who wake up one day to find
themselves haunted by memories of lives that don’t seem to be theirs.
With their every waking moment occupied by fragments of someone or
something not from their consciousness, the so-called “re-rememberers”
try to ground themselves in their strange new reality.
</p>
<p>
Carried by incredible performances from Brian Tyree Henry, Steven Yeun,
Hunter Schafer, Mark Ruffalo, Ayo Edebiri, and Tom Hanks, the show oozes
stardom. Most importantly, in a boundary-pushing decision taken by Apple
TV’s marketing team, the series can be viewed only if you are a current
resident of Golden Acres Senior Living Community, an elder-care complex
located in scenic Rocky River, Ohio.
</p>
<p>
Apple TV spared no expense in bringing the complex emotions and
multi-layered timelines of <i>Rememory</i> to the small screen, with
season 2 rumored to have a budget of $150 million. Much of that was
spent on creating an immersive reality never before seen on a television
show, with every part of <i>Rememory</i>’s suburban setting being
recreated on a soundstage in LA.
</p>
<p>
In addition to John’s (Yeun) condo, in which he grieves the life whose
sad re-remembrances he now experiences, and Marie’s (Schafer) workplace,
a nondescript and soul-crushing call center, the production team
custom-built a fully functional replica of a Target that appears for
only twenty seconds in the second episode of season 2. As a result, the
Apple TV marketing team was left with a fifty-dollar budget, which they
spent on ensuring that the residents of Golden Acres could pool together
for one Apple TV login that allowed them to watch the show. While no one
else in America has seen <i>Rememory</i>, the Golden Acres residents
were entranced by the show, especially once they realized they couldn’t
figure out how to turn the TV back to the Browns game they were trying
to watch.
</p>
<p>
With a previously unheard-of level of detail and budget flowing into the
show, Apple TV decided not to advertise for the program. Relying on word
of mouth, the streaming service pursued a viral marketing strategy
consisting of a QR code that Golden Acres residents did not know how to
access or share. As a result, the show had an average viewership of
fourteen people per episode, one more than the number of Emmy
nominations season 2 received.
</p>
<p>
Despite that, Apple TV is determined to make sure its new hit is put in
front of as many eyes as possible. Starting this upcoming season, people
interested in watching the show can check themselves into Golden Acres
for luxurious end-of-life care and the chance to see Nicole Kidman’s
cameo in episode 5.

H100s were prohibited by the chip ban, but not H800s. Everyone assumed
that training leading edge models required more interchip memory
bandwidth, but that is exactly what DeepSeek optimized both their model
structure and infrastructure around.
</p>
<p>
Again, just to emphasize this point, all of the decisions DeepSeek made
in the design of this model only make sense if you are constrained to
the H800; if DeepSeek had access to H100s, they probably would have used
a larger training cluster with much fewer optimizations specifically
focused on overcoming the lack of bandwidth.

[…] in the era where these AI systems are true ‘everything machines’,
people will out-compete one another by being increasingly bold and
agentic (pun intended!) in how they use these systems, rather than in
developing specific technical skills to interface with the systems.
</p>
<p>
We should all intuitively understand that none of this will be fair.
Curiosity and the mindset of being curious and trying a lot of stuff is
neither evenly distributed or generally nurtured. Therefore, I’m coming
around to the idea that one of the greatest risks lying ahead of us will
be the social disruptions that arrive when the new winners of the AI
revolution are made - and the winners will be those people who have
exercised a whole bunch of curiosity with the AI systems available to
them.

Order: We Must Stop Everyone from Transitioning, So the President Knows
Who to Grope</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: McSweeney’s Internet Tendency</p>

<i>“An executive order President Donald Trump signed on his first day
back in office offers a new federal government definition of the sexes
that could have a major impact on transgender people nationwide. The
order calls for the federal government to define sex as only male or
female and for that to be reflected on official documents such as
passports and policies such as federal prison assignments.” —

<li>-
</div>
<p>
<span class="dropcap">B</span>y the authority vested in me as President
by whatever shreds of the Constitution I feel like keeping today, it is
hereby ordered:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Section 1. Purpose.</strong> <br /> Folks, we have to get a
handle on the genders. There’s a lot of trans-ing going on, in multiple
directions. They’re trans-ing all over the place. California’s on fire.
Eggs are too goddamned expensive, and dogs and cats are making out in
the streets. Somewhere, a thirty-four-year-old comedy writer is wearing
a compression top and sipping a green tea. It’s anarchy. And it’s
hurting the women, which is something that I definitely care about.
Women should have at least three rights, I think.
</p>
<p>
We need women, probably. We also need sex. They’ve taken out all the sex
and replaced it with gender, which is a big problem because it makes it
very boring. No more.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Section 2. Policy and Definitions.</strong> <br /> It is the
policy of the United States to recognize two sexes: “groper” and
“grope-ee.” These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in
fundamental and incontrovertible reality. Maintaining this clear
distinction between the sexes is critical to prurient inquiry, “public
safety,” my personal morale, and trust in the infallibility of my urges.
</p>
<p style="padding-left:2em;">
<ol type="a">
<li>Men who have rejected their biological realities as “gropers” will
heretofore be reclassified as “cucks.” Women not deemed to be “gropable”
shall be known as “dogs.”
</p>
<p style="padding-left:2em;">
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>For science purposes, “women” are likewise defined as large
reproductive cells encased in sexy hourglass meat globs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Section 3. Recognizing That Women Are Biologically Distinct from
Men.</strong> <br /> Within thirty days, the trans-ing back and forth
has got to stop, folks.
</p>
<p style="padding-left:2em;">
<ol type="a">
<li>“Women” are “women” because I want to grope them. “Men” are “men”
because I do not. If we start crossing those lines, then I have to think
about things I don’t want to think about, like the word “fluid” and how
innate biological differences shouldn’t need aggressive legislative
reinforcement.
</p>
<p style="padding-left:2em;">
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>We especially have to stop this for the kids. It’s just too
upsetting and confusing. For me. We need to protect our girls. These
young girls, they’re the gropable future. And sometimes the present, if
they’re at least solid eights—which shall forthwith be defined as
“asking for it.”
</p>
<p style="padding-left:2em;">
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li>To clarify (a), “men” are “men,” and “women” are “women,” but
“girls,” or “juvenile human females,” are also “women,” when it’s
convenient for me.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Section 4. On the Protection and Control of Women and
Children.</strong>
</p>
<p style="padding-left:2em;">
<ol type="a">
<li>When kids get trans-ed, they’re sexualized inappropriately instead
of appropriately, which is to say, when they marry us as soon as they’re
legal and can bear our blond offspring.
</p>
<p style="padding-left:2em;">
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>No man shall invade intimate single-sex spaces and activities
designed for women, like
<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jtes/a-fifth-teen-beauty-queen-says-trump-visited-dressing-room#.puz1qYYKy">dressing
rooms</a>, unless he owns the pageant and he’s inspecting to make sure
there are no men in there, and he’s already “seen it all before.”
</p>
<p style="padding-left:2em;">
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li>Nonbinaries are nonsensical and will not be recognized for
efficiency. If I have unsupervised access to a fifteen-year-old in an
evening gown, I don’t want to waste time trying to figure out what kind
of “Dylan” they are.
</p>
<p style="padding-left:2em;">
<ol start="4" type="a">
<li>We condemn trans surgeries for minors, which
<a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/gender-affirming-surgeries-rarely-performed-on-transgender-youth/">I
like to say is a thing</a>. We need to know that Madison’s new B-cups
are naturals. To be clear, we’re still in favor of implants. But they
have to go on top of naturals. Or else that would be unnatural.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Section 5. On the Protection of the President and His
Capacities.</strong>
</p>
<p style="padding-left:2em;">
<ol type="a">
<li>We must preserve the sanctity of the American family and my future
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jeffrey-epstein-introduced-trump-14-ghislaine-maxwell-accuser-says-rcna7253">dating
pool</a>, since Melania’s getting a little long in the tooth.
</p>
<p style="padding-left:2em;">
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>But it’s not about age. Not at all. It’s about consent, people.
<a href="https://19thnews.org/2023/10/donald-trump-associates-sexual-misconduct-allegations/">I
love consent</a>. I’d kiss consent on the mouth. Trans-ing is a slippery
slope. If there’s an incredible-looking girl at a party — even if she
was a little up there, like, say
<a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/turning-35-donald-trump-comments">thirty-five</a>
— I’d rather that girl be in a pine box
(<a href="https://www.hrc.org/resources/fatal-violence-against-the-transgender-and-gender-expansive-community-in-2023">many
such cases</a>) than touch her without asking and then learn that she
once did Pinewood Derby as a Cub Scout. That would be a violation of my
consent, very bad.
</p>
<p style="padding-left:2em;">
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li>All federal agencies must subordinate their current functions to
indulge the President’s need to live out the first fifteen minutes of
<i>Wag the Dog</i>. This is what your tax dollars are going to.
</p>
<p style="padding-left:2em;">
<ol start="4" type="a">
<li>By eliminating trans-ing, we will eliminate transphobia. Transphobia
is a terrible, terrible thing. It’s too complicated. We must return to
being a proper country where “misogyny” is “misogyny” and “homophobia”
is “homophobia,” so you can keep your sexual assault and your gay panic
separate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Section 6. On Documentation and Language.</strong>
</p>
<p style="padding-left:2em;">
<ol type="a">
<li>All citizens must have their correct sex on their identification.
When it comes to the transed, you see, we can always tell, so we need
extensive documentation that tells us what we already know.
</p>
<p style="padding-left:2em;">
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security will
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/24/politics/state-department-suspends-passports-x-gender-marker/index.html">suspend
the processing of any passport with a gender change marker</a>. We don’t
want the trans here, but I’ll be damned if I let them leave.
</p>
<p style="padding-left:2em;">
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>To enforce the mutably immutable truth of binary sex, I hereby
eliminate all use of the prefix “trans.” The White House doesn’t stand
for divisive concepts like “transgender,” “translation,”
“transcultural,” “transformation,” “transcendence,” or “transparency.”
“Transgression” and “transaction” can stay, but only for the President
and his cabinet.
</p>
<p>
You’re all safer now, and you’re welcome. Some things aren’t meant to
change. I know I sure won’t.

<p>This might sound crazy to just about everyone, but I think Trump
could maintain an AI lead for the United States by immediately rolling
back Biden-era export controls on AI chips, like the NVIDIA H100. Hear
