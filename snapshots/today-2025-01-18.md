## SilverStone FLP01 HTPC case turns back the clock with retro looks

date: 2025-01-18, from: Liliputing

<p>SilverStone made a name for itself with sleek-looking PC cases. The FLP01 is unabashedly not one of those&#8230; at least not in a 21-century way. The fluted front panel and its taupe-y gray highlight would have been right at home on the oversized pages of Computer Shopper. The company first announced the FLP01 computer case [&#8230;]</p>

Josh Wisenbaker: With the most recent update to the Apple Developer Forums, it&#8217;s become pretty much impossible to update this collected wisdom in any regular way.

## Who Said It: Donald Trump or Martin Luther King Jr.?

date: 2025-01-17, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p>1. &#8220;If you can&#8217;t fly, then run. If you can&#8217;t run, then walk. If you can&#8217;t walk, then crawl. But by all means, keep moving.&#8221;</p> <p>2. &#8220;Why would Kim Jong Un insult me by calling me ‘old,’ when I would <span class="caps">NEVER</span> call him ‘short and fat&#8217;? Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend — and maybe someday that will happen!&#8221;</p> <p>3. &#8220;An individual has not started living until he can rise above the narrow confines of his individualistic concerns to the broader concerns of all humanity.&#8221;</p> <p>4. &#8220;Nobody knew health care could be so complicated.&#8221;</p> <p>5. &#8220;When evil men plot, good men must plan. When evil men burn and bomb, good men must build and bind. When evil men shout ugly words of hatred, good men must commit themselves to the glories of love.&#8221;</p> <p>6. &#8220;The Continental Army suffered a bitter winter of Valley Forge, found glory across the waters of the Delaware, and seized victory from Cornwallis of Yorktown. Our army manned the air, it rammed the ramparts, it took over the airports, it did everything it had to do.&#8221;</p> <p>7. &#8220;Capitalism was built on the exploitation of Black slaves and continues to thrive on the exploitation of the poor, both Black and white, both here and abroad.&#8221;</p> <p>8. &#8220;This is Martin Luther King on steroids… I told that to [North Carolina gubernatorial candidate and self-proclaimed “Black Nazi” Mark Robinson], I said I think you’re better than Martin Luther King. I think you’re Martin Luther King times two.&#8221;</p> <p>9. &#8220;Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.&#8221;</p> <p>10. &#8220;I’ve got to be the cleanest&#8212;I think I’m the most honest human being, perhaps, that God has ever created.&#8221;</p> <p>11. &#8220;It is a cruel jest to say to a bootless man that he ought to lift himself by his own bootstraps.&#8221;</p> <p>12. &#8220;I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute. Is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside, or almost a cleaning? Because you see, it gets in the lungs, and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it’d be interesting to check that.&#8221;</p> <p>13. &#8220;Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.&#8221;</p> <p>14. &#8220;I would like to extend my best wishes to all, even the haters and losers, on this special date, September 11th.&#8221;</p> <p>15. &#8220;Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.&#8221;</p> <p>16. &#8220;When I said that Hillary Clinton got &#8216;schlonged&#8217; by Obama, it meant got beaten badly. The media knows this. Often used word in politics!&#8221;</p> <p>17. &#8220;I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality.&#8221;</p> <p>18. &#8220;If you look at Martin Luther King, when he did his speech, his great speech, and you look at ours, same real estate. Same everything. Same number of people, if not, we had more. And they said, &#8216;He had a million people,&#8217; but I had 25,000 people. But when you look at the exact same picture, everything&#8217;s the same, because it was the fountains, the whole thing, all the way back from Lincoln to Washington. And you look at it, and you look at the picture of his crowd, my crowd, we actually had more people. They said I had 25,000, and he had a million people. And I&#8217;m okay with it because I liked Dr. Martin Luther King.&#8221;</p> <p>19. “I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: &#8216;We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.&#8217; I have a dream that one day, on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day, even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.”</p> <p>20. &#8220;I’m the least racist person you have ever interviewed.&#8221;</p> <div class='break'>- - -</div><p style="text-align:center;"><i>Just in case you need an answer key:</i><br /> Even numbers: Trump<br /> Odd numbers: <span class="caps">MLK</span> Jr.</p>

## Excerpts from The Believer: An Interview with Annie Leibovitz

date: 2025-01-17, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://www.thebeliever.net/an-interview-with-annie-leibovitz/"><img src="https://edge.mcsw.net/mcsweeneys/yqdy50bnjtwy1lejf9wbehtjep0v" alt="" /></a><br /> “<i>When I started working for</i> Rolling Stone,<i> I really thought I was doing journalism. And then I quickly realized I wasn’t, because I had a point of view.</i>”</p> <div class='break'>- - - </div><p><i>In many ways, I am an unlikely choice of interviewer for a subject like Annie Leibovitz. While I am trained as a photographer and still utilize photography across my work, for the most part I no longer author my own pictures. So I was skeptical when the call came: Were the editors of </i>The Believer <i>sure they wanted me for the job? Wouldn’t the magazine do better with someone more closely aligned with Leibovitz’s work—straddling the art, reportage, and editorial worlds as it does? But deep down I felt this request was tugging on my young self: As a teenager growing up in 1990s Philadelphia, I obsessively collected Leibovitz’s pictures from magazines, taping them up all over my walls, such that the walls, in fact, disappeared under their many layers. Gap ads,</i> Rolling Stone <i>magazine covers, and, most of all, pictures from the “Got Milk?” campaign filled my little room by the hundreds. I was, it might be noted, unaware that these were her pictures. At that point, I didn’t know anything about who made the images I was obsessed with, images I wanted to live with and inside. I had only my teenage desires to guide me. And they propelled me toward her at full tilt.</i></p> <p><i>Almost three decades later, on this occasion, I miraculously got the chance to speak to Leibovitz, the person who had informed my own burgeoning photographic consciousness, curiosity, and ambition. I once heard someone say that we are all born with Beatles lyrics in our heads, so deep is their creative mark on the world. The same might be said for Leibovitz’s pictures (as evidenced by my own teenage image-collecting pursuits): she has been making this work for so many decades, and with such consistency, innovation, and panache, that it feels hard to imagine the cultural landscape without her impression.</i></p> <p><i>Leibovitz grew up in Connecticut in a large Jewish family; her father was in the Air Force, and her mother was engaged in art and dance (Leibovitz herself often refers to photographing as a kind of choreography). After graduating from art school at the now-closed San Francisco Art Institute—and living on a kibbutz in Israel for several months—she quickly became the chief photographer for</i> Rolling Stone <i>in 1973. Leibovitz has photographed at a wild pace ever since, making some of the most iconic portraits of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries: from John and Yoko in bed; to incarcerated people in Soledad State Prison hugging family members; to a young Whoopi Goldberg in a bathtub full of milk; to Demi Moore, nude and pregnant, on the cover of</i> Vanity Fair. <i>In addition to regularly shooting covers and features for that magazine and</i> Vogue, <i>Leibovitz has had exhibitions at the Brooklyn Museum, Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, and the National Portrait Gallery.</i></p> <p><i>Our conversation unfolded over Zoom on a warm October morning (I was in the Midwest, and Leibowitz was in New York City), and after a handful of rescheduling emails. It centered on artistic process—sketching, editing, and more—while also delving into her new show at Hauser &amp; Wirth, titled Stream of Consciousness. The show includes seventy images, from throughout her career, and largely centers creative thinkers and makers as subjects. We also discussed my work—a surprise to me!—with regard to my use of archival photography and how we relate to images in relation. We talked about Leibovitz’s decision not to publish pictures of her children, attending synagogue, camera phones, photographing Kamala Harris in the final weeks of the 2024 presidential campaign, and why she feels photojournalism is the most exciting work happening in the field.</p> <p>—Carmen Winant</i></p> <div class='break'>- - -</div><h2>I. <span class="caps">WEAK</span> IN <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">KNEES</span> <span class="caps">FOR</span> <span class="caps">HOCKNEY</span></h2> <p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">BELIEVER</span>: Ready to start?</p> <p><span class="caps">ANNIE</span> <span class="caps">LEIBOVITZ</span>: Let me get some water here. I just drove in at six o’clock this morning from upstate, so I’m a little bit…</p> <p><span class="caps">BLVR</span>: Tired?</p> <p>AL: And then I had a call with these publishers; my rabbi, Rabbi [Angela] Buchdahl, needs a photograph, so it was great to have a conversation with her publishers about what they would like to do.</p> <p><span class="caps">BLVR</span>: What temple do you go to?</p> <p>AL: Central Synagogue [in New York City]. My three daughters were all bat mitzvahed there.</p> <p><span class="caps">BLVR</span>: How nice—and that you are photographing your rabbi too.</p> <p>AL: She is an extraordinary woman. You know, she’s Korean American, actually. Her sermons are quite extraordinary. I mean, the only reason I’m still at this synagogue is because of her. You look forward to her, to what she’s going to say. Where do you live now?</p> <p><span class="caps">BLVR</span>: I live in Columbus, Ohio.</p> <p>AL: I read about you, and that was part of the reason I put the interview off. I went, Oh shit. She’s serious. She’s fucking serious.</p> <p><span class="caps">BLVR</span>: You’re giving me too much credit, I think.</p> <p>AL: No, no, no. You are a serious artist, and, you know, I crawled into bed the night before and started to do my due diligence, and I called [my studio manager] Karen Mulligan. I said, “I can’t do this tomorrow morning. First of all, she’s too serious.” I mean, I think it’s interesting what you’re doing, the way you’re using photography.</p> <p><span class="caps">BLVR</span>: I appreciate that. I’ll carry it with me.</p> <p>AL: Certainly. The older I get, and with the accumulation of the work I have, it is so interesting to see the relationships between the photographs. That’s kind of what I’m interested in in the show I’m having at Hauser &amp; Wirth. The gallery world, it’s such a strange animal, you know?</p> <p><span class="caps">BLVR</span>: I have questions for you about this, so don’t get too far ahead of me! But first, I want to ask you about photographing such famous subjects. These are people that are used to being photographed; I imagine that makes your job both easier and harder. How does your process differ, if at all, from photographing noncelebrities?</p> <p>AL: I mean, I’ve been doing this, what, fifty years. It started with journalism. Or what I thought was journalism. I admired the photo story, you know? When I started working for <i>Rolling Stone</i>, I really thought I was doing journalism. And then I quickly realized I wasn’t, because I had a point of view. I found that my work was stronger if I went with that point of view. So the work evolved. It started with these incredible years at <i>Rolling Stone</i>. When I look at that work, I see a young, insane, obsessed photographer. Just, you know, photographing everything in front of me, never going home, really just working all the time. It was a great school for observation and learning and becoming a better photographer. <i>Rolling Stone</i> and I grew up together, and eventually, with the magazine, I began learning how to photograph people. Coming from that place, it was very awkward making portraits at first, because you had an… appointment with someone. It wasn’t as fluid as just being able to be around and watching something evolve or happen.</p> <p>So what happened? My subjects were sitting for photographs, and I became a little bit more inventive and conceptual. I had a whole slew of very, very conceptual years. Of course, there’s no going back after you start working like that. Now I’m kind of like a dinosaur when it comes to what I do, which is sort of a sitting portrait. I became very aware of what it is I am doing, and feel very responsible to it—to sitting photograph. I’m very interested in it and how to make it work.</p> <p>As for working with people who are very, very famous and aren’t very famous, I think you’ll see, if you look through all my work, that it’s a mixture. Also, in a lot of the work, I photograph people who aren’t famous yet, and then they’re suddenly famous. When I did Whoopi Goldberg [in 1984], she was unknown. I just went to her apartment in Berkeley and photographed her there. So I’m just saying, these people sometimes become famous after the fact.</p> <p><span class="caps">BLVR</span>: It’s interesting: The way I set up that initial question was sort of a way to ask, What is it like to photograph famous subjects versus non-famous ones? But what I heard in your answer was a far more interesting distinction: between photojournalism and portraiture.</p> <p>AL: Yes, yes. The reality is that I love photography—every part of it. There are so many ways to use photography. I mean, it’s so big. I never wanted to be pinned down to one kind of style or work. I have a huge photography book collection. I have a few photographs that I own, Robert Frank and Cartier-Bresson, and people I grew up on whose work I loved.</p> <p>I just went to a Carrie Mae Weems show up at Bard [College], and I couldn’t believe it. To go through every single room and see how she used photography—it was just stunning to me to see the breadth of her ideas. I remember seeing her very early work, with the kitchen photographs [the <i>Kitchen Table Series</i>, 1990], and thinking, Oh my gosh, here goes art photography, whatever it is. But art photography always has been interesting, quite honestly. Hockney was the first person to do it, when he did his study on perspective. I remember being weak in the knees, thinking, That’s how the eye sees—the way he collaged his pictures together. I was so frustrated with the frame of the camera then—that everything had to be in that frame. We learned with Cartier-Bresson and Robert Frank to compose in that rectangle, and to use the whole negative. But now it’s so wide open, and it’s so interesting, and it’s such a great medium. It deserves to be, and it is, now, taken seriously. It is art. It’s great to live through all that.</p> <div class='break'>- - -</div><p style="text-align:center;"><strong><i><a href="https://www.thebeliever.net/an-interview-with-annie-leibovitz/">Read the rest of the interview over at </i>The Believer</a>.</strong></p>

date: 2025-01-17, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p>Finally, and not a moment too soon, our government will look, smell, and act like the <i>real</i> America. Not an Ivy League college campus, not a melting pot of immigrants striving to achieve the American dream, but instead an endlessly replenishing stream of shout-talking men outraged that people with disabilities or families with children who are offered extra assistance actually take it, along with a steady diet of morning beers, explosive rage, and ketchup.</p> <p>It&#8217;s far past time for those who “govern” to demonstrate the same lack of awareness as everyone pretending not to know what boarding group they’re in. And why did we win January 6 if not for the right to berate underpaid service workers who aren’t allowed to unionize and also so we can have both pizza and tequila shots for breakfast? Why was 9/11 an inside job if not for our hard-won ability to wear pajama bottoms and inflatable neck pillows in public and constantly have to relearn through the application of loud buzzing sounds and shame that jewelry is made of metal? And what was the whole point of all those genocides if not to have unlimited access to themed socks and overpriced regional T-shirts?</p> <p>Why did we win some wars if not to one day step on a slow-moving rubbery walkway that will just bring us to a place in the small distance that’s not even better, just a little bit closer to the end? Why did we violate a whole bunch of human rights stuff if not to look down on anyone who doesn’t have <span class="caps">TSA</span> pre-check as well as those who do? What is the point of taking over Greenland and the Panama Canal?</p> <p>I’m genuinely asking.</p> <p>What is our military fighting for other than to one day have access to basic health care, suicide prevention, addiction treatment, <span class="caps">PTSD</span> treatment, disability assistance, financial stability, mental health services, homelessness prevention, treatment for military sexual trauma, and thorough investigations into the toxins, trauma, and brain injuries suffered during their service to our country, and I totally forgot the point I was trying to make.</p> <p>Right, the point is, it’s far past time for the physical and behavioral aspects of our government, not to mention the basic filth level and daily aromatic je ne sais quois to more closely reflect the combination <i>Wolf of Wall Street</i> / itinerant carnival / Klan rally that is now the actual true American experience. Join us at gate D4, now E24, now B28, now A287&#8212;whoops, now back to D4 via a shuttle and infrastructure constructed in a previous century. Come jump into a sauce packet of patriotism, get ready to guzzle the cloying artificial syrup of selfishness, and crack open a can of frozen concentrate brimming with public toenail clippings, open-mouth coughing, and watching marriages unravel before your eyes.</p> <p>Do you smell that? That’s freedom. Also, caramel corn and farts.</p> <p>Real democracy is now ready to board. Are you a <i>real</i> American or not? Do you not have the slightest clue how to go through security after twenty-four fucking years? Are you just waiting for someone to act up so you can duct tape them to their seat? Do you hear that other people have tight connections, and if we all just sat down and gave them time to grab their bags and deboard first, they might have a chance of making their connections and think, “Fuck that shit”? Are you itching to ask every non-white person you see where they’re really from, and so help you god, if they answer “Kansas,” you will seriously lose it? And do you often think about how there doesn’t seem to be nearly enough exit rows for everyone who wants out?</p> <p>May God and air traffic control bless our new president, because obviously the billionaires already have. And may someone—truly we’ve proven we’ll take literally anyone—bless the United States of America, a country that has never been more terminal, where the skies have never been less friendly, where you are not free to get up and move across state borders with that uterus of yours, and where the doors are definitely about to fall off.</p>

Hello again! If we haven&#8217;t met before, I&#8217;m Alex. I&#8217;m a returning fellow to the DRC, and I&#8217;m excited to be back.

## A Pre-Game Pep Talk by a College Football Coach Who Recently Audited a Class on Nietzschean Thought

date: 2025-01-17, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p>Team, tonight we play the biggest game of our lives. I know you have heard our opposing coach’s comments&#8212;“We&#8217;re doing everything we can to honor our creator.” I also know you saw last week when their star quarterback took a knee and grabbed the sideline reporter&#8217;s microphone so the world could hear his prayer:</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;"><i>Our father, who art in heaven<br /> I throw this ball for you<br /> Please grant me touchdowns<br /> And deliver me from interceptions<br /> All glory to you, God<br /> And to State, the greatest team in your creation<br /> Amen.</i></p> <p>Now, you&#8217;re probably thinking, &#8220;This ain’t good, Coach. They’re convinced they have the Almighty on their side. If that’s true, what chance do we have? How are we going to beat both State <i>and</i> the God of Western Christianity?&#8221;</p> <p>Well, men, I recently completed my audit of <span class="caps">PHIL</span> 332: Nietzsche &amp; The Death of Practical Meaning, and I’m tired of mincing words.</p> <p>Their God is dead.</p> <p>Time of death: tonight.</p> <p>Place of death: Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia.</p> <p>Causes of death: the ceaseless march of modernity, the dawn of an age of existential crises, the fatal annoyance of having to endlessly answer the prayers of State’s performatively evangelical offensive linemen, and our explosive passing attack.</p> <p>When we take the field, we will do what we know how to do. We are going to get pressure on the quarterback. We are going to execute great downfield blocking. And we are going to show State University that Christian morality is by no means self-evident.</p> <p>We will engage State in a practical philosophical thought experiment that proves an unblocked corner blitz can shatter the idea of God. We will offer definitive evidence that no man has the moral high ground in a two-minute drill. We will teach our gospel: the gospel of deep crossing routes that break the necessary assumptions of Christianity, leaving State&#8217;s hands grasping at air, empty and faithless.</p> <p>Come halftime, State&#8217;s coach will stare dead-eyed into the camera, a man whose table has lost three of its four legs. Holly Rowe will ask him, “Coach, what adjustments will help your team get back on track?”</p> <p>He will respond in a whisper: “They are die Übermenschen.”</p> <p>We are the Overmen, the Supermen, the dadgum Tech Cougars, those who have crossed from mindless acceptance to a world of self-directed, restless solitude in pursuit of a grounded human ideal.</p> <p>Our opponent lives, though they do not yet know it, in the twilight of their idols—specifically, the false idols of ground-and-pound, line-of-scrimmage-obsessed football. We require no idols. We have been reborn via our newly installed flea flicker, which reflects our belief in the quintessence of man. We require no moral code. Our defensive coordinator is neither good nor evil. Three-man front or four-man front? Neither and both. We are beyond scheme. Our opponent will live in an infinite loop of eternal recurrence, an unchanging eternity of us Cougars gaining first downs on jet sweeps forever.</p> <p>We do know that our victory will be meaningless. As soon as it is over, it will mean no more than the act of eating an English muffin at the team buffet. Our win will be as worthless as the paper money society has denominated as value, although it is valueless. Our &#8220;National Title&#8221; will be as meaningful as the drunkard’s boast that he is heir to the throne of England. Because he is, and he is not, just as we are, and we are not.</p> <p>Yet this does not change what we do tonight.</p> <p>Tonight, we won&#8217;t rely on faith or intelligent design. Tonight, we won&#8217;t pray for victory. Tonight, we won&#8217;t supplicate to a higher power. No, tonight, we are accountable for what happens, and what is going to happen is that we are going to kick State’s ass up and down the field.</p> <p>We will score touchdowns and have the player who scored lie down while the rest of us pantomime throwing dirt on him, representing the burial of the ancient gods, now sacrificed to progress, science, and our air raid passing offense.</p> <p>We will play clean in coverage, bat passes down, point toward the heavens, and then point at our butts, indicating that their dead God is butt at football.</p> <p>We will stand victorious at the podium with Holly Rowe. She will ask us how we feel, and we will say, without embarrassment, that we feel as gods must feel. That WE <span class="caps">ARE</span> gods. The Gods of Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia.</p> <p>Hands in, gentlemen. Clear eyes, full hearts, Zarathustra can&#8217;t lose.</p>
