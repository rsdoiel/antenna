## Best laptop of 2024

date: 2024-01-30, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>You might be confused by the title of this post. You might be wondering why on earth am I writing about the best laptop of 2024. I never reviewed products on this blog. There was no best laptop of 2023 post nor a best laptop of 2022. And fear not, there won’t be a post about the best laptop of 2024 either.</p>
<p>You see, this is not going to be a post about laptops. It’s going to be a post about words, about generated content, and about SEO. It’s also going to be an experiment because I’m a curious person and the inner workings of search engines fascinate me.</p>
<p>I was listening to a tech podcast the other day and in it, they were talking about the evolving landscape of the publishing industry with the increasing trend of companies making AI-generated listicles in an attempt to rank high on Google. And then you have things like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/28/24053882/arc-search-browser-web-app-ios">Arc search browser</a> that will use Ai to generate summaries of the pages they browsed on your behalf. The result is that you have Ai consuming content written by Ai in an attempt to do... something? I’m not sure what the end game is to be perfectly honest with you but I’m interested because this all looks like a shit show.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the best laptops of 2024. In that podcast, they mentioned that one of the prime targets in the search results tech space is, you guessed it, the first page of results for the query “best laptops of 2024”. And while I was listening I thought “I wonder how high can a stupid blog post get on that SERP if I don’t actually write content that’s relevant to the query”.</p>
<p>And this is that post. I have no interest in laptops. I know nothing about laptops. I don’t care about laptops. I don’t even know which laptops came out in 2024. I do know people are interested in knowing which laptop is the best laptop in 2024 which is why I just wasted some of your time (I’m sorry) making you read a silly post about the best laptops in 2024 that has nothing to do with laptops.</p>
<p>Will google pick this one up? Will I even reach the first page? Who knows! But if for some reason you landed on this blog post searching for the best laptop of 2024 send me an email. I promise you I’ll do my best to help you figure out what’s the best laptop for you.</p>

## Criming On The Blockchain

date: 2024-01-30, from: David Rosenthal's blog

I apologize for the delay in posting but, as you will see, the post I was working on grew rather long.<br />
<br />
It seems obvious that doing crimes and writing the receipts to an immutable public ledger is risky, but many criminals have been convinced that there is no risk because cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are anonymous. Although there are cryptocurrencies with anonymous transactions, such as Monero and zCash, they are much more difficult to use and much less liquid than pseudonymous cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. As many criminals have discovered, without an unrealistically intense focus on <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/02/inadequate-opsec.html">operational security (opsec)</a>, the identity behind the pseudonym can be revealed. An entire industry has evolved to do these revelations, tracing the flow of coins through their blockchains.<br />
<br />
Below the fold I discuss the techniques and results of blockchain tracing, based on four main sources:<br />
<ul>
<li>Andy Greenberg's new book entitled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/"><i> Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency</i></a>.</li>
<li>Chainalysis' report <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/"><i>2024 Crypto Crime Trends: Illicit Activity Down as Scamming and Stolen Funds Fall, But Ransomware and Darknet Markets See Growth</i></a>
and his <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/stablecoin-sanctions-violations-crypto-crime/"><i>‘Stablecoins’ Enabled $40 Billion in Crypto Crime Since 2022</i></a>.</li>
<li>The UN Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC) report <a href="https://www.unodc.org/roseap/uploads/documents/Publications/2024/Casino_Underground_Banking_Report_2024.pdf"><i>Casinos, Money Laundering, Underground Banking, and Transnational Organized Crime in East and Southeast Asia: A Hidden, Accelerating Threat</i></a>.</li>
<li>Recent posts on <a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/">ChainArgos blog</a>.</li>
</ul>
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
There are two main use cases for cryptocurrencies, speculation and crime. Although speculation is likely behind the majority of transactions its externalities, such as people losing their life savings, have cause it to be downgraded from "harmless" to "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_(radio_series)">mostly harmless</a>", the minority of criminal transactions are definitely harmful. I've written about these harms in, among others, my <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/02/ee380-talk.html">EE380 talk</a>, <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/05/the-cryptocurrency-use-case.html"><i>The Cryptocurrency Use Case</i></a> and <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/09/cryptocurrency-enabled-crime.html"><i>Cryptocurrency-enabled Crime</i></a>.<br />

Greenberg's book lays out the history of blockchain tracing technology, starting from Sarah Meiklejohn <i>et al</i>'s 2013 paper entitled <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2504730.2504747"><i>A Fistful of Bitcoins: Characterizing Payments Among Men with No Names</i></a>. Their abstract reads:<br />
<blockquote>
Bitcoin is a purely online virtual currency, unbacked by either physical commodities or sovereign obligation; instead, it relies on a combination of cryptographic protection and a peer-to-peer protocol for witnessing settlements. Consequently, Bitcoin has the unintuitive property that while the ownership of money is implicitly anonymous, its flow is globally visible. In this paper we explore this unique characteristic further, using heuristic clustering to group Bitcoin wallets based on evidence of shared authority, and then using re-identification attacks (i.e., empirical purchasing of goods and services) to classify the operators of those clusters. From this analysis, we characterize longitudinal changes in the Bitcoin market, the stresses these changes are placing on the system, and the challenges for those seeking to use Bitcoin for criminal or fraudulent purposes at scale.
</blockquote>
Meiklejohn started from an observation by Satoshi Nakamoto. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">Greenberg quotes Nakamoto</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
"Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner,” Satoshi wrote. “The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.”
</blockquote>
Linking the inputs of multi-input transactions roughly halved the then number of Bitcoin users. Meiklejohn then developed the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">"change address" technique</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
When you pay someone 6 bitcoins from a 10-coin address, 6 coins go to their address. Your change, 4 coins, is stored at a new address, which your wallet software creates for you. The challenge, when looking at that transaction on the blockchain as a sleuthing observer, is that the recipient’s address and the change address are both simply listed as outputs, with no label to tell them apart.<br />
<br />
But sometimes, Meiklejohn realized, spotting the difference between the change address and the recipient address was easy: If one address had been used before and the other hadn’t, the second, totally fresh address could only be the change address
</blockquote>
Meiklejohn's first criminal case started when "Flycracker" raised funds to mail Brian Krebs a baker's dozen bags of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">heroin from Silk Road</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
  Flycracker had made it easy. By posting a Bitcoin address to the cybercriminal forum, he’d given Meiklejohn a starting point. She simply copied the thirty-four-character string into her blockchain software and looked at the transactions at that address. After collecting 2 bitcoins in donations at the address he’d posted, worth around $200 at the time, a little over three-quarters of the money had been sent to another address, with a third collecting the change. At a glance, Meiklejohn immediately identified the change address and checked the money’s destination against her database. Sure enough, the address was one of the nearly 300,000 she had already tagged as belonging to the Silk Road. Meiklejohn had just connected Flycracker’s address directly to the source of the heroin he’d tried to use to frame Krebs.

The first major cryptocurrency bust Greenberg recounts was the arrest of Silk Road's Dread Pirate Roberts in a San Francisco library. It <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">did not depend upon these tracing techniques</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The FBI has described that cybersurveillance coup as the result of a misconfiguration in the site’s use of the Tor anonymity software but has been reluctant to ever officially explain that error in a courtroom.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">In fact</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
it had been the IRS’s Gary Alford, sitting in his New Jersey home four months earlier, who’d done the meticulous, unglamorous work that had led to the case’s first real breakthrough. Alford had been using Google to dig up the earliest online posts about the Silk Road on drug forums when he’d found a curious artifact: Someone going by the name “altoid” had posted to a site called the Shroomery in January 2011 recommending the Silk Road’s just-launched dark web market as a source for drugs. Around the same time, a user with the same handle had also asked for programming help on a coding forum. On that page, altoid had listed his email address: rossulbricht@gmail.com.
</blockquote>
Another IRS agent, Tigran Gambaryan, received a tip that Carl Force, one of the DEA agents working on Silk Road, had used a fake ID to set up an account at Bitstamp, a cryptocurrency exchange, and  deposited a lot of BTC He had cashed out $200K and, as Gambaryan <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">examined his financial records</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
He found that Force had, in late 2013, paid off his home’s entire mortgage, an outstanding loan of $130,000. He’d repaid, too, a $22,000 loan he’d taken out against his federal retirement account. He’d even made a gift of tens of thousands of dollars to his local church, the sort of largesse that, Gambaryan knew all too well, was tough to afford on a federal agent’s salary. The numbers only got shadier from there: Gambaryan found records of real estate investments in which Force had listed his net worth as more than 1 million. That wealth was almost entirely due, it became clear, to a massive influx of liquidated bitcoins from cryptocurrency exchanges like Bitstamp and CampBX that had flowed into Force’s bank accounts. The payments totaled $776,000 beyond his $150,000 annual DEA salary over the two prior years that he’d worked on the Silk Road case. With that ample financial padding, Force had then retired from the DEA, just days before Gambaryan began to look into his records.
</blockquote>
Gambaryan could get Force's wallet addresses from the exchanges he used, and he found an unencrypted message from DPR referencing a 525 BTC payment to Force's investigative alias, but he needed proof, So, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">Greenberg writes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Despite having read Meiklejohn’s paper, he possessed none of the data that she’d assembled over months of clustering Bitcoin addresses and identifying them with test transactions. So he simply started copying Bitcoin addresses from Carl Force’s account records—the ones he’d gotten from exchanges such as CampBX and Bitstamp—and pasting them into the search field on Blockchain.info, which displayed the entire blockchain on the web. At first, the collections of garbled character strings seemed meaningless to Gambaryan. But almost immediately, he could see he was onto something. On September 27, 2013, just a few days before Ross Ulbricht’s arrest, Gambaryan saw with a jolt of recognition that one of Force’s CampBX addresses had received a 525-bitcoin payment—the magic number that DPR had mentioned in his conveniently unencrypted message.
</blockquote>
Gambaryan manually followed the chains backward, from their inputs to the outputs that caused them, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">until finally</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Following the money at each of the remaining addresses back one more step, he now saw the coins had originally come from just four sources. Each of those addresses had received their funds on the same day: August 4, 2013—the exact date when the Dread Pirate Roberts had told Nob he’d paid him. Gambaryan mentally recorded the payments: They were for 127, 61, 134, and 203 bitcoins. He added the numbers in his head. They summed up to 525 bitcoins.<br />
...<br />
The next morning, after a few hours’ sleep, Gambaryan began texting his DHS contact Jared Der-Yeghiayan, the Armenian American agent in Chicago whom he’d befriended. He needed to check the four addresses he’d found with someone who had access to the Dread Pirate Roberts’s Bitcoin wallet. As a member of the Silk Road investigation team, Der-Yeghiayan still had access to all the site’s server data, including its Bitcoin addresses. Der-Yeghiayan called Gambaryan back a few hours later and confirmed what Gambaryan already knew: Each of the four addresses belonged to DPR.
</blockquote>
He thus became apparently the first law enforcer to use blockchain tracing as evidence in an investigation. Its first use in a trial appears to be when, with help from Nick Weaver, the prosecution of Ross Ulbricht introduced a trace of his payment for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/"> a murder-for-hire attempt</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
But the day when the prosecution found the incontrovertible, public, and unerasable proof of Ulbricht’s Silk Road millions, argues Nick Weaver, remains a milestone in the history of cryptocurrency and crime. “That is the date,” Weaver says, “that you can state unequivocally that law enforcement learned that the blockchain is forever.”

The blockchain tracing industry's pioneer, Chainalysis, spun out of the Kraken exchange as a result of the next big crime Greenberg covers, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">collapse of the Mt. Gox exchange</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Kraken’s management, in a pro bono attempt to help rescue the cryptocurrency ecosystem from the rippling shock of Mt. Gox’s failure—and the collapse in Bitcoin’s price that followed—had agreed to help distribute any remaining bitcoins that could be found to Mt. Gox’s thousands upon thousands of angry creditors.<br />
<br />
Michael Gronager, for his part, had taken on a far more uncertain task. He’d agreed to find the missing coins. By all appearances, this was not a rational decision. The Danish entrepreneur had left his relatively comfortable position as the COO of Kraken to found a new start-up whose sole client, for the moment, was this roomful of Japanese bankruptcy lawyers asking him to track down Mt. Gox’s gigantic, wayward fortune. Even calling them a client would be a stretch: He would receive no fee, and no portion of the recovered funds, if he could manage to find any.
</blockquote>
The co-evolution of Bitcoin's and tracing technology started with the revelation that Chainalysis, by running a node in the Bitcoin network, could discover the IP address associated with many wallets, which garnered both hostility and customers. With a head-start, Chainalysis rapidly became the leader in their emerging market, as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Increasing-Returns-Dependence-Economics-Cognition/dp/0472064967">Brian Arthur</a> would have predicted.<br />
<br />
The next investigation Greenberg covers was into the BTC-e exchange, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">whose</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
computers where the exchange was hosted weren’t on the dark web, protected by Tor. They ought to be discoverable with a simple “traceroute” command, an operation that anyone with a computer and an internet connection can run to find a site’s IP address—no harder than looking up a commercial service’s number in a phone book. Gambaryan checked, and it turned out the only layer of misdirection that had prevented curious observers from learning the location of BTC-e’s servers in the first place was a company called Cloudflare, a web infrastructure provider and security service that shielded the exchange’s IPs from prying eyes like Gambaryan’s.
</blockquote>
Subpoenas to Cloudflare revealed they were hosted in the US, which allowed them to be <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">imaged</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Gambaryan dug into the data his team had copied from the BTC-e server. What he found was a revelation: The IP address for the account trading in stolen Mt. Gox coins on BTC-e matched one of the few IP addresses on the BTC-e server’s allow list for the administrators’ connections. In other words, the person who had siphoned hundreds of thousands of bitcoins from Mt. Gox into BTC-e wasn’t just any BTC-e user. They were a
BTC-e administrator. Specifically, an admin with the username WME. “The gears started turning in my head,” Gambaryan remembers. “What better way to launder hundreds of thousands of bitcoins than to launch your own Bitcoin exchange?”
</blockquote>
WME was Alexander Vinnik but, alas, he was in Russia.<br />
<br />
Greenberg goes on to describe the takedown of Alexandre Cazes, who ran the Alphabay dark-web market and the related takeover of the Hansa dark-web market, and then of the Welcome to Video child sexual abuse site.
This led to the arrest and indictment of a Texas-based <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">Border Patrol agent</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The Texas man had taken a rare approach to his legal defense: He’d pleaded guilty to possession of child sexual abuse materials, but he also appealed his conviction. He argued that his case should be thrown out because IRS agents had identified him by tracking his Bitcoin payments—without a warrant—which he claimed violated his Fourth Amendment right to privacy and represented an unconstitutional “search.”<br />
  <br />
  A panel of appellate judges considered the argument—and rejected it. In a nine-page opinion, they explained their ruling, setting down a precedent that spelled out in glaring terms exactly how far from private they determined Bitcoin’s transactions to be.<br />
  <br />
  “Every Bitcoin user has access to the public Bitcoin blockchain and can see every Bitcoin address and its respective transfers. Due to this publicity, it is possible to determine the identities of Bitcoin address owners by analyzing the blockchain,” the ruling read. “There is no intrusion into a constitutionally protected area because there is no constitutional privacy interest in the information on the blockchain.”<br />
  <br />
  A search requires a warrant, the American judicial system has long held, only if that search enters into a domain where the defendant has a “reasonable expectation of privacy.” The judges’ ruling argued that no such expectation should have existed here: The HSI agent wasn’t caught in the Welcome to Video dragnet because IRS agents had violated his privacy. He was caught, the judges concluded, because he had mistakenly believed his Bitcoin transactions to have ever been private in the first place. 
</blockquote>
This firmly established blockchain tracing as a legitimate form of evidence.<br />

One case Greenberg mentions only in passing is the theft of nearly 120K BTC from Bitfinex, to which <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66390639">Heather Morgan and Ilya Lichtenstein pled guilty</a>. They were intitially flagged as suspects during the takeover of AlphaBay that Greenberg describes in detail. I discussed the tracing steps revealed by the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1470186/download"><i>Statement of Facts</i></a> from their indictment in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/02/inadequate-opsec.html"><i>Inadequate OpSec</i></a>. The image shows a small part of the tracing evidence in this case. The two VCE4 accounts used Russian e-mail addresses, but the VCE7 and VCE8 accounts were in the name of companies controlled by Lichtenstein and Morgan. Tracing the chains back connected the VCE4 accounts to  the suspects, who had taken the precaution of funding VCE4 with Monero.<br />

Deanonymizing individual wallets and flows is valuable to Chainalysis' clients; law enforcement for evidence and financial institutions for risk-assessment. But their vast collection of tagged wallet addresses and transactions is also valuable in aggregate. It enables statistical analysis of the cryptosphere, such as Chainalysis' annual report on cryptocurrency crime. This year's is introduced in <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/"><i>2024 Crypto Crime Trends: Illicit Activity Down as Scamming and Stolen Funds Fall, But Ransomware and Darknet Markets See Growth</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
2023 saw a significant drop in value received by illicit cryptocurrency addresses, to a total of $24.2 billion. As always, we have to caveat by saying that these figures are lower bound estimates based on inflows to the illicit addresses we’ve identified today. One year from now, these totals will almost certainly be higher, as we identify more illicit addresses and incorporate their historic activity into our estimates. For instance, when we published our Crypto Crime Report last year, we estimated $20.6 billion worth of illicit transaction volume for 2022. One year later, our updated estimate for 2022 is $39.6 billion. Much of that growth came from the identification of previously unknown, highly active addresses hosted by sanctioned services, as well as our addition of transaction volume associated with services in sanctioned jurisdictions to our illicit totals.<br />
<br />
Another key reason the new total is so much higher, besides the identification of new illicit addresses: We’re now counting the $8.7 billion in creditor claims against FTX in our 2022 figures. In last year’s report, 
</blockquote>
Although these arae large sums, Chainalysys estimate they represent a fairly small proportion of the total cryptocurrency volume, falling from 0.42% in 2022 to 0.34% in 2023. Of course, it is unlikely that they have identified <i>all</i> the illicit transactions.<br />

The report has a <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/">big surprise</a>:<br /> 
<blockquote>
Through 2021, Bitcoin reigned supreme as the cryptocurrency of choice among cybercriminals, likely due to its high liquidity. But that’s changed over the last two years, with stablecoins now accounting for the majority of all illicit transaction volume. This change also comes alongside recent growth in stablecoins’ share of all crypto activity overall, including legitimate activity.
</blockquote>
Bitcoin's volatility is great for speculation, but when it fails to proceed moonwards it is a big problem for criminals, and <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/">especially for sanctions-busters</a>:<br /> 
<blockquote>
Some forms of illicit cryptocurrency activity, such as darknet market sales and ransomware extortion, still take place predominantly in Bitcoin. Others, like scamming and transactions associated with sanctioned entities, have shifted to stablecoins. Those also happen to be the biggest forms of crypto crime by transaction volume, thereby driving the larger trend. Sanctioned entities, as well as those operating in sanctioned jurisdictions or involved with terrorism financing, also have a greater incentive to use stablecoins, as they may face more challenges accessing the U.S. dollar through traditional means, but still want to benefit from the stability it provides.
</blockquote>
The report notes that stablecoin users,criminal or not, run the risk of having their wallets and thus their funds "frozen", as Tether has been doing recently. Patrick Tan covered the case of an Indian user (The Victim) in detail in <a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/what-happens-when-tether-freezes-your-tether-5a8ece2bd508"><i>What happens when Tether “freezes” your Tether?</i></a>.

<blockquote>
On a basic level this user was relying on an unlicensed money transmitter where they have 0 access to any authority that feels accountable to them.<br />
<br />
Tether isn’t an Indian money services business. Nor is it regulated in the victim’s country. Or anywhere with a real process.<br />
...<br />
This — precisely this — is the cost of living outside the law. You may end up with no recourse. Or not.<br />
<br />
But you don’t even have someone to complain to that feels accountable for your problems (i.e. your local police or elected representative, or an employee of a business accountable to a regulator you can contact).

It turns out that evading sanctions is the <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/">major criminal use case</a>:<br /> 
<blockquote>
Perhaps the most obvious trend that emerges when looking at illicit transaction volume is the prominence of sanctions-related transactions. Sanctioned entities and jurisdictions together accounted for a combined $14.9 billion worth of transaction volume in 2023, which represents 61.5% of all illicit transaction volume we measured on the year. Most of this total is driven by cryptocurrency services that were sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), or are located in sanctioned jurisdictions, and can continue to operate because they’re in jurisdictions where U.S. sanctions are not enforced. <br />
<br />
While those services can and have been used for nefarious purposes, it also means that some of that $14.9 billion in sanctions-related transaction volume includes activity from average crypto users who happen to reside in those jurisdictions.  For example, Russia-based exchange Garantex, which was sanctioned by OFAC and OFSI in the U.K. for its facilitation of money laundering on behalf of ransomware attackers and other cybercriminals, was one of the biggest drivers of transaction volume associated with sanctioned entities in 2023. Garantex continues to operate because Russia does not enforce U.S. sanctions. So, does that mean all of Garantex’s transaction volume is associated with ransomware and money laundering? No. Nevertheless, exposure to Garantex introduces serious sanctions risk for crypto platforms subject to U.S. or U.K. jurisdiction, which means those platforms must remain ever-more vigilant and screen for exposure to Garantex in order to be compliant.
</blockquote>
Translation: platforms need to subscribe to Chainalysis to be safe.  Andy Greenberg's <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/stablecoin-sanctions-violations-crypto-crime/"><i>‘Stablecoins’ Enabled $40 Billion in Crypto Crime Since 2022</i></a> quotes Chainalysis' Andrew Fierman:<br />
<blockquote>
As examples, Fierman points to Nobitex, the largest cryptocurrency exchange operating in the sanctioned country of Iran, as well as Garantex, a notorious exchange based in Russia that has been specifically sanctioned for its widespread criminal use. Stablecoin usage on Nobitex outstrips bitcoin by a 9:1 ratio, and on Garantex by a 5:1 ratio, Chainalysis found. That's a stark difference from the roughly 1:1 ratio between stablecoins and bitcoins on a few nonsanctioned mainstream exchanges that Chainalysis checked for comparison.

Of course, when Chainalysis says "stablecoin" they essentially mean Tether. Three years ago, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKeMfxLV8K8">interview of Charles Yang</a>, head trader of Genesis Block based in Hong Kong, by John Riggins descibed how Tether was the basis for trade flows in South-East Asia because it evaded governments' currency controls. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKeMfxLV8K8">Yang noted</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
bank acccounts are the absolute most valuable thing — you have to set up a bunch of different companies, a lot of different bank accounts just to facilitate trades that aren't that big, maybe $50K. The moment you tell them this is for a USDT trade, you're basically asking them to shut your bank account down.

<blockquote>
As third- and fourth-party payments have become better understood by authorities and more widely reported following ‘Operation Chain Break’ and other measures in China, organized crime groups have responded by accelerating the integration of cryptocurrencies into their illegal betting operations, creating significant challenges for investigators. In recent years, law enforcement and financial intelligence authorities have reported the growing use of sophisticated, high-speed money laundering ‘motorcade’ teams specializing in underground USDT – fiat currency exchanges (卡接回U) across East and Southeast Asia. This has also included the mass recruitment of mule bank accounts across virtually all jurisdictions in the Asia Pacific region which can be purchased for as little as US $30.<br />
<br />
Due to the rise of cryptocurrency-integrated motorcades, points running syndicates, and other challenges, in 2021 the Government of China banned cryptocurrency transactions, trading, and mining. The industry subsequently migrated to various jurisdictions, particularly driving up already rising cryptocurrency adoption in several countries in Southeast Asia, together with the establishment of high-risk and underground cryptocurrency exchanges. At the same time, it is worth noting that cryptocurrency flows connected to organized crime have been cited as being vastly underestimated by industry experts as well as law enforcement and regulatory authorities in the region. Experts have pointed to a number of shortcomings related to existing analyses including massive gaps in crime attribution on the blockchain, fabricated reporting by crypto exchanges, and the prevalence of wash trading which inflates crypto transaction volumes, thereby shrinking the portion of illicit transactions identified.

The US is rightly concerned that Tether is undermining their sanctions system, but countries like China with strict controls on cross-boarder currency flows are also worried about similar undermining. Fortunately, the flows of Tether are observable on the Ethereum and Tron blockchains, so tracing techniques can be and, as I discussed in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/11/the-stablecoin-saga.html"><i>The Stablecoin Saga</i></a>, <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/11/the-stablecoin-saga-continued.html"><i>The Stablecoin Saga Continued</i></a> and <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/11/alamedas-on-ramp.html"><i>Alameda's On-Ramp</i></a> are being, applied.<br />

## Toyota takes the crown

date: 2024-01-30, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>The auto industry had a generally strong 2023. This certainly included Toyota, which reported that it&#8217;s held onto its title as the world&#8217;s best-selling car company. But during prepared remarks, the company&#8217;s chairman also offered an apology. We unpack. Plus, can we expect any interest rate moves from the Federal Reserve this week? Then, we head to Germany, where protests are sweeping the country to counter the far-right Alternative for Deutschland party.</p>

## Which self is this?

date: 2024-01-30, from: Rachel Kwon blog

Last month Katherine called out the tension inherent in a &ldquo;personal&rdquo; website which is that it is both public and personal, and one&rsquo;s public (or professional) persona is often different from that of their personal life. Robin Rendle riffed on the concept and said that it&rsquo;s totally fine for personal websites to be messy or imperfect or weird (i.e., not necessarily how you&rsquo;d want to present a &ldquo;professional&rdquo; front) and declared, in a pretty great and punchy/pithy statement, &ldquo;You’re a poem and not software&rdquo;.

## THE THUNDERBOLT

date: 2024-01-30, from: Howard Jacobson blog

As a love-token to my readers here are the first few pages of my new novel which is published on Feb 1 DAY ONE Kerpow! Funny - unless it&#8217;s ominous - she had put that very word down on a Scrabble board only a day or two or before. Jubilant, the k scoring triple. Her opponent - the man she had known for over twenty years, slept with for five, no longer slept with with for however many more that left, and now played Scrabble with instead - contested the spelling. Kapow, yes. Kerpow, no. They fought over it. Have it your way, she said in the end. Which meant she had to remove a garment.

## US, China Launch Fentanyl Talks in Sign of Cooperation Amid Differences

date: 2024-01-30, from: VOA News USA

BEIJING  — American and Chinese officials met Tuesday to discuss joint efforts to stem the flow of fentanyl into the U.S., a sign of cooperation as the two global powers try to manage their contentious ties.


The two-day meeting was the first for a new counternarcotics working group. One focus of the talks was fentanyl, the synthetic opioid that is ravaging America, and in particular ingredients for the drug that are made in China.


Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to restart cooperation in a handful of areas, including drug trafficking, when he and U.S. President Joe Biden met outside San Francisco in November. The agreements were a small step forward in a relationship strained by major differences on issues ranging from trade and technology to Taiwan and human rights.


The U.S. wants China to do more to curb the export of chemicals that it says are processed into fentanyl, largely in Mexico, before the final product is smuggled into the United States.




Chinese Public Security Minister Wang Xiaohong said the two sides had in-depth and pragmatic talks.


"We reached common understanding on the work plan for the working group," he said at a ceremony marking the inauguration of the group.


The head of the U.S. team, Jen Daskal, a deputy homeland security advisor in the White House, said that Biden had sent a high-level delegation "to underscore the importance of this issue to the American people."


China used to be a major supplier of fentanyl, and the U.S. has credited Beijing for a 2019 crackdown that led to "a drastic reduction in seizures of fentanyl shipments ... from China." Now it wants Beijing to stop the export of the ingredients known as "precursors."


Synthetic opioids are the biggest killers in the deadliest drug crisis the U.S. has ever seen. More than 100,000 deaths were linked to drug overdoses in 2022, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than two-thirds involved fentanyl or similar synthetic drugs.


China had previously rebuffed U.S. appeals for help as relations between the two global powers deteriorated, often responding that the U.S. should look inward to solve its domestic problems and not blame them on China.


Talks were formally put on ice in 2022, when China suspended cooperation in several areas including narcotics to protest a visit to Taiwan by then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.


The ice began to thaw in the lead-up to the Biden-Xi meeting in November 2023. A U.S. Senate delegation pressed the fentanyl issue on a visit to Beijing in October and said that Chinese officials expressed sympathy for the victims of America's opioid crisis.




But China refused to discuss cooperation unless the U.S. lifted sanctions on the Public Security Ministry's Institute of Forensic Science. The Commerce Department had imposed the sanctions in 2020, accusing the institute complicity in human rights violations against Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups in China's Xinjiang region.


The U.S. quietly agreed to lift the sanctions to get cooperation on fentanyl. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi acknowledged "the removal of the obstacle of unilateral sanctions" in a speech on China-U.S. relations earlier this month.


State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller called it "an appropriate step to take" given what China was willing to do on the trafficking of fentanyl precursors.

As you might expect, the most common answer was the network I was asking on (except Facebook, no one answered there, I guessed that might happen, because Facebook is different from the others). I asked because I'm trying to figure that out for myself, and I'm kind of disappointed that I find myself going to Threads more often. It has the greater <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Sweaty+Palms+Quotient">Sweaty Palms Quotient</a>, the feeling I used to have every week in the 80s when MacWeek or PC Week arrived. I always cleared the time to go through each issue carefully to see what my friends and competitors were up to. Then I would talk to my reporter friends, who wanted to know what I thought, or what back-room perspectives I could share with them. This was the time of the telephone, even before everyone had email, in the tech industry, believe it or not. Anyway, this isn't going the way I hoped it would. For me an open network built on the idea of <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a> is what I want to see, what I'm working towards. And seeing products like WordPress and its competitors as full-class members of the social web, because they already do textcasting, now all they need is to be hooked up to a social web that understands that writing isn't just <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+grunts+and+snorts">grunts and snorts</a>. Anyway, it'll give you some encouragement that people in the fediverse are most optimistic about their preferred network being the best of the new lot. I still like Bluesky, a lot, because of the intelligence and creativity of the people who use it. And I like the UI, for its simplicity and familiarity, but I'm concerned it'll lose its simplicity when they federate. And don't count Twitter out yet, there's far more happening there than any of the other networks. And a lot of what you read on the other nets  is wishful thinking about the demise of Twitter. Hasn't happened yet, and my guess is it won't. It's really hard to snuff out machines with the kind of momentum Twitter has, even though Musk is doing his best. One more thing to think about, I don't think federation is what we need, I think we need <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/03/21/theWebIsMadeOfInterop.html">interop</a>. It's a more permissive kind of compatibility, and will happen a lot sooner than federation, which honestly, I don't think ever will happen. With the usual disclaimers, most important that I'm often wrong, and am open to other constructive points of view.

## A Climate Database Melts Away

date: 2024-01-30, from: Heatmap News

Residents in Queensland, Australia, are evacuating as thunderstorms inundate towns on the coast. California is still waiting for an atmospheric river to dump rain on the state, which should start tomorrow.</em></p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. U.S. finalizes stove efficiency rules<br/></h3><p>Yesterday, the U.S. Department of Energy finalized energy efficiency rules for both gas and electric stoves that the agency says will save consumers around $1.6 billion in energy costs over 30 years, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-29/us-sets-rules-to-make-gas-and-electric-stoves-more-efficient?srnd=green" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. The standards, which are scheduled to take effect in 2028, won’t ban gas stoves, but should reduce carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 4 million metric tons over three decades.</p><h3>2. A vast archive of climate data literally melts away</h3><p>Glaciers are treasure troves of information for scientists studying climate change. Ice core analysis can often give researchers a detailed look at the composition of the atmosphere over time, which in turn tells us just how human-caused pollution affects the climate. The problem, of course, is that climate change also makes glaciers melt — and now one of them, the Corbassière glacier in Switzerland, has degraded so much that it’s no longer viable for research, its ice cores a muddled mess of meltwater. </p><p>“The climate archive is destroyed,” scientists at the Paul Scherrer Institute wrote in a <a href="https://www.psi.ch/en/media/our-research/glacier-melting-destroys-important-climate-data-archive" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>. “It is as if someone had broken into a library and not only messed up all the shelves and books, but also stole a lot of books and mixed up the individual words in the remaining ones, making it impossible to reconstruct the original texts.”</p><h3>3. Sustainable foods could have a $10 trillion upside</h3><p>Global food systems are “destroying more value than they create” and in dire need of an overhaul, according to a new <a href="https://foodsystemeconomics.org/wp-content/uploads/FSEC-Global_Policy_Report.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">assessment</a> from the Food System Economics Commission (FSEC). By rethinking the way we approach food, the authors say, we could create up to $10 trillion in health and economic benefits around the world. </p><p>As Justine Calma <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/29/24054325/food-sustainable-agriculture-diet-benefits-report" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writes</a> in <em>The Verge</em>, that would mean both a tweak to our diets — the report doesn’t call for a worldwide shift to vegetarianism, but does advocate for a reduction in meat consumption — and a proper accounting in food prices of all the costs of production that we currently sweep under the rug. That latter bit could be an especially tough pill to swallow, and the study authors caution there would have to be institutional support for lower-income sections of society for fear of protests like the petrol price protests that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/12/03/672862353/who-are-frances-yellow-vest-protesters-and-what-do-they-want" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gripped</a> France in 2018, or the farmer protests <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/why-are-french-farmers-protesting-2024-01-29/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ongoing</a> in Europe. </p><p>Still, the report states, the benefits would far outweigh the costs, with undernutrition potentially eradicated by 2050, 174 million premature deaths from diet-related chronic disease prevented, and the environmental impacts bringing countries closer to their Paris Agreement goals.</p><h3>4. Avian flu comes for birds of all feathers</h3><p>Avian flu is devastating California’s “egg basket,” sweeping through Sonoma and Merced counties a year after a similar outbreak in the Midwest caused egg prices around the country to soar, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/avian-flu-chicken-outbreak-california-poultry-eggs-976f0f82843bf716dbad64f459b4b8be" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Associated Press</a>. Over the past two months, commercial farms have had to slaughter nearly a million birds to contain the outbreak. The loss of those birds caused a temporary spike in the price of eggs in the Bay Area before more were brought in from outside the region; it remains to be seen if this outbreak will become big enough to affect prices in other parts of the country as well.</p><p>Further afield, at least two penguins in the Antarctic have died from bird flu, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/29/first-penguins-die-in-antarctic-of-deadly-h5n1-bird-flu-strain-aoe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writes</a> Phoebe Weston in <em>The Guardian</em>. One gentoo penguin is confirmed to have died from the virus, and scientists suspect it also took out one king penguin — if confirmed, that would be the first of its species to be killed by the deadly H5N1 variant. Last year, scientists warned about “one of the largest ecological disasters of modern times” if the virus reached Antarctic penguin populations; the birds are currently clustered for breeding season, which means it could soon turn into a superspreader event.</p><h3>5. GoFundMe for climate disasters is helping the wealthy most</h3><p>A new <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4535190" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> analyzing post-disaster crowdfunding campaigns has found that cash raised through sites like GoFundMe disproportionately benefits the wealthy. The main reason, Christopher Flavelle <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/29/climate/gofundme-disaster-relief-climate.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writes</a> in <em>The New York Times</em>, appears to be social networks: Wealthy people are more well-connected, particularly to other wealthy people, and so inevitably get more money. It’s a showcase of why we need to prioritize governmental support for disaster victims; as one of the study authors told Flavelle, “we cannot count on this form of private charity to fill funding gaps.”</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p>Scientists have, for the first time ever, captured footage of a newborn Great White Shark. The finding means researchers could, finally, figure out where the sharks birth their young — and in turn lead to greater environmental protections in previously unprotected patches of ocean. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

## Hubble Spies a Spinning Spiral

date: 2024-01-30, from: NASA breaking news

Looking like a baseball lobbed into the depths of the universe, ESO 420-G013 is a face-on spiral galaxy and a Seyfert galaxy. Dark lanes of dust are visible against the background glow of the galaxy’s many stars.  About 10 percent of all the galaxies in the universe are thought to be Seyfert galaxies. They are […]

## iPhone ProRes Log in Peru and Taiwan

date: 2024-01-30, from: Stu Maschwitz blog

<iframe scrolling="no" allowfullscreen src="//www.youtube.com/embed/yFm-tLrQ8ZQ?wmode=opaque" width="854" frameborder="0" height="480"></iframe>

<p>This is a blog post about a video, which is about new color-conversion LUTs for Apple Log footage from the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max (updated from my <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/applelog">first set</a>). The video is also a mini-travelogue of my recent trips to Taiwan and Peru. This post dives a bit deeper into both the LUT workflows, and my state of mind about shooting digital-cinema-grade footage with a device I always have with me.</p><p>There’s a lot going on here.</p>

<p>I always have a moment when packing for a trip: Which camera to bring? Which lenses? I know I’m always happier when I pack less, like just a single prime lens. But sometimes FOMO gets me and I pack three zooms.</p>
<p>For my trip to Lima, I brought my <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1645238-REG/sony_ilce7rm4a_b_alpha_a7r_iv_mirrorless.html/BI/4778/KBID/5292">Sony a7RIV</a> with the uninspiring-but-compact, <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1008123-REG/sony_sel35f28z_sonnar_t_fe_35mm.html/BI/4778/KBID/5292">Sony 35mm F2.8 prime</a>. I lugged it around for a few days, but wasn’t really feeling it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my iPhone 15 Pro Max was calling to me with its ProRes Log video mode. “I’m 10-bit!” It would say. “Think of the fun you’ll have color grading me!”</p>
<p>I told my phone to shut up, and proceeded to shoot very little with it — or my Sony. Like a squirrel in the middle of the street, drawn in two different directions at once, I creatively froze.</p>
<p>Photography, for me, is made up of a lot of habits, and shooting iPhone video with aesthetic intent is just not yet baked into my travel muscle memory.</p>
<h2 id="made-in-taiwan">Made in Taiwan</h2>
<p>A month later, I took a family trip to Taiwan, one of my favorite places in the world. I’d had some time to process my Peru deadlock, and decided to stop judging my own creative impulses, and let inspiration guide me in which camera I pulled out.</p>
<p>I wound up shooting a lot of video.</p>

<p>I <em>loved</em> shooting ProRes Log in Taiwan with the iPhone 15 Pro Max. I’d occasionally reach for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blackmagic-camera/id6449580241">Blackmagic Camera</a>, but I often just used the default camera app. I stuck my phone (with its <a href="https://www.threads.net/@prolost/post/C0VGQ8gPPyU">crumbling case</a>) out of taxi sunroofs and skyscraper windows, held it above teeming crowds and shoved it between chain-link fences. Seeing the broad dynamic range I was capturing in scenarios from noontime sun to neon-lit nights got me excited about grading the footage later.</p>
<p>It’s exactly the way I feel about shooting raw stills with my Sony, knowing that I’ll be able to go crazy on them in Lightroom. The photographing act is just half of the process.</p>
<p>Step through the frames below to see how color transforms a single shot from the video above:</p>

<p>There’s been a bit of a gold rush of people hawking creative LUTs that apply a particular “look” to iPhone Log footage. My day job is, in part, helping make color tools like <a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/red-giant/magic-bullet/looks">Magic Bullet Looks</a>, which can do so much more than any LUT. Creative LUTs are great, and by all means support the folks making them — but that’s not what my iPhone LUTs <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/applelog">were</a> or are.</p>
<p>The Prolost iPhone LUTs convert Apple Log to various other color spaces, and support three kinds of workflow:</p>
<h3 id="grade-under-a-display-transform-lut">Grade Under a Display Transform LUT</h3>
<p>Apple Log is a totally decent color space to work in, so color correcting Apple Log can be as simple as applying <a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/red-giant/magic-bullet/colorista">Magic Bullet Colorista</a> and choosing one of my <strong>Monitor &amp; Grade</strong> LUTs. That’s what you see me doing in the video above. Colorista (set to Log mode) does its work on the native Apple Log pixels, and the LUT converts the result to look nice on video.</p>
<p>Many other systems work like this, including <a href="https://luma-touch.com">LumaFusion</a>, which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLtNJ8DbQrQ">ships with</a> Prolost Apple Log LUTs.</p>
<p>The key is <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/applelog">color correcting under the LUT</a>.</p>
<h3 id="bring-apple-log-into-an-existing-workflow">Bring Apple Log into an Existing Workflow</h3>
<p>Color work is often done in some intermediate color space. This is usually some kind of wide-gamut, log format, such as Davinci Wide Gamut/Intermediate, or one of the <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/aces">ACES log spaces</a>.</p>
<p>The Prolost <strong>ACES</strong> LUTs simply convert Apple Log to either ACEScc or ACEScct log, allowing you to grade your iPhone footage alongside any other professional camera, and output them all through the same pipeline.</p>
<h3 id="shooting-through-a-lut">Shooting Through a LUT</h3>
<p>The Blackmagic Camera app allows you to load any LUTs you want and view through them without baking them into your footage. With my LUTs, you can shoot with the same LUTs you grade under later, for a truly professional (no joke!) workflow.</p>
<p>The real stars of this update though are the <strong>FC</strong> LUTs. They add an informative False Color overlay to the Shoot/Grade LUTs, making sure you always nail your exposure. Watch the video to see them in action. I already can’t imagine shooting without them.</p>
<p>These LUTs work well in Blackmagic Camera or even on an external HDMI monitor.</p>

<p>As if this video wasn’t enough work already (I shot the a-roll in mid-December), I decided to use it as a test case for creative editorial in DaVinci Resolve. It’s the ACES LUTs that allowed me to incorporate Magic Bullet Looks into my Resolve color workflow.</p>
<p>Maxon just shipped a really nice <a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/article/maxon-red-giant-update-delivers-fast-beautiful-bokeh-and-realistic-lens-flares">update</a> to Magic Bullet Looks, with simplified color management made possible by more and more apps we support doing darn fine color management at the timeline level.</p>
<p>So in Resolve, I can use my LUT to convert Apple Log to ACEScc, and then apply Magic Bullet Looks, which can now be set to work in ACEScc with a single click.</p>

<p>I can sneak additional Resolve corrector nodes in between those two for local corrections. Resolve is great at this, and Looks is great at creative look development, so this is a match made in heaven.</p>

<h2 id="gear-inspires">Gear Inspires</h2>
<p>Every photographer knows the feeling of lusting after new gear. We know it so well that we remind ourselves constantly that “next camera syndrome” is debilitating, and that “most cameras are better than most photographers.” Gear is not the answer. Go shoot.</p>
<p>There is, however, a counterpoint to these truths: As shooters, we take inspiration where we can get it. And sometimes a new technique, a new locale, or even, yes, a new bit of gear is what provides it.</p>
<p>The key is to listen for that inspiration, and don’t judge it.</p>
<p>Even if it’s coming from your phone.</p>

## AI helped Microsoft become the world’s most valuable company

date: 2024-01-30, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Over the past few weeks, Microsoft overtook Apple to become the most valuable company in the world by market capitalization. And investors will be hoping for more good news on that front when the company announces quarterly earnings on Tuesday. Also on the program: Walmart is offering store managers up to $20,000 in stock a year. We hear more. Plus, if you can&#8217;t afford college, how about chicken wings?</p>

## Power-sharing could return to Northern Ireland

date: 2024-01-30, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Democratic Unionist Party leader Jeffrey Donaldson said his party had agreed to end its almost two-year boycott of the Northern Ireland Assembly. We&#8217;ll discuss. Then, we&#8217;ll take a look at ongoing demonstrations across Europe: Hundreds of tractors are blocking major roads into Paris as farmers protest against red tape and foreign competition, and Germany experiences a second weekend of protests against a far-right party&#8217;s mass deportation meetings.</p>

## The Last Woman Standing

date: 2024-01-30, from: Dan Rather's Steady

There&#8217;s an old expression in boxing, a &#8220;slugger&#8217;s chance.&#8221; It means an underdog is given an outside chance to win if the fighter has a reputation for being an especially heavy puncher. I&#8217;ve been saying since Nikki Haley first got into the race for the Republican presidential nomination that she had a slugger&#8217;s chance. With Haley&#8217;s bid for an upset fading but not yet finished, let&#8217;s take a look at whether she still has even that chance. The so-called smart money has said from the start that there is no way she can defeat Donald Trump.

## Pluralistic: My McLuhan lecture on enshittification (30 Jan 2024)

date: 2024-01-30, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links My McLuhan lecture on enshittification: Live from Berlin. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading My McLuhan lecture on enshittification (permalink) Last night, I gave the annual Marshall McLuhan lecture at the Transmediale festival in Berlin. The event was sold out and while there's a video that'll be posted soon, they couldn't get a streaming setup installed in the Canadian embassy, where the talk was held: https://transmediale.de/en/2024/event/mcluhan-2024 The talk went of fabulously, and was followed by commentary from Frederike Kaltheuner (Human Rights Watch) and a discussion moderated by Helen Starr. While you'll have to wait a bit for the video, I thought that I'd post my talk notes from last night for the impatient among you. I want to thank the festival and the embassy staff for their hard work on an excellent event, and reiterate what a pleasure it was to meet John Horgan, Canada's ambassador to Germany. And now, on to the talk! Last year, I coined the term 'enshittification,' to describe the way that platforms decay. That obscene little word did big numbers, it really hit the zeitgeist. I mean, the American Dialect Society made it their Word of the Year for 2023 (which, I suppose, means that now I'm definitely getting a poop emoji on my tombstone). So what's enshittification and why did it catch fire? It's my theory explaining how the internet was colonized by platforms, and why all those platforms are degrading so quickly and thoroughly, and why it matters &#8211; and what we can do about it. We're all living through the enshittocene, a great enshittening, in which the services that matter to us, that we rely on, are turning into giant piles of shit. It's frustrating. It's demoralizing. It's even terrifying. I think that the enshittification framework goes a long way to explaining it, moving us out of the mysterious realm of the 'great forces of history,' and into the material world of specific decisions made by named people &#8211; decisions we can reverse and people whose addresses and pitchfork sizes we can learn. Enshittification names the problem and proposes a solution. It's not just a way to say 'things are getting worse' (though of course, it's fine with me if you want to use it that way. It's an English word. We don't have der Rat für Englisch Rechtschreibung. English is a free for all. Go nuts, meine Kerle). But in case you want to use enshittification in a more precise, technical way, let's examine how enshittification works. It's a three stage process: First, platforms are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die. Let's do a case study. What could be better than Facebook? Facebook is a company that was founded to nonconsensually rate the fuckability of Harvard undergrads, and it only got worse after that. When Facebook started off, it was only open to US college and high-school kids with .edu and k-12.us addresses. But in 2006, it opened up to the general public. It told them: “Yes, I know you’re all using Myspace. But Myspace is owned by Rupert Murdoch, an evil, crapulent senescent Australian billionaire, who spies on you with every hour that God sends. “Sign up with Facebook and we will never spy on you. Come and tell us who matters to you in this world, and we will compose a personal feed consisting solely of what those people post for consumption by those who choose to follow them.” That was stage one. Facebook had a surplus — its investors’ cash — and it allocated that surplus to its end-users. Those end-users proceeded to lock themselves into FB. FB — like most tech businesses — has network effects on its side. A product or service enjoys network effects when it improves as more people sign up to use it. You joined FB because your friends were there, and then others signed up because you where there. But FB didn’t just have high network effects, it had high switching costs. Switching costs are everything you have to give up when you leave a product or service. In Facebook’s case, it was all the friends there that you followed and who followed you. In theory, you could have all just left for somewhere else; in practice, you were hamstrung by the collective action problem. It’s hard to get lots of people to do the same thing at the same time. You and your six friends here are going to struggle to agree on where to get drinks after tonight's lecture. How were you and your 200 Facebook friends ever gonna agree on when it was time to leave Facebook, and where to go? So FB’s end-users engaged in a mutual hostage-taking that kept them glued to the platform. Then FB exploited that hostage situation, withdrawing the surplus from end-users and allocating it to two groups of business customers: advertisers, and publishers. To the advertisers, FB said, 'Remember when we told those rubes we wouldn’t spy on them? We lied. We spy on them from asshole to appetite. We will sell you access to that surveillance data in the form of fine-grained ad-targeting, and we will devote substantial engineering resources to thwarting ad-fraud. Your ads are dirt cheap to serve, and we’ll spare no expense to make sure that when you pay for an ad, a real human sees it.' To the publishers, FB said, 'Remember when we told those rubes we would only show them the things they asked to see? We lied!Upload short excerpts from your website, append a link, and we will nonconsensually cram it into the eyeballs of users who never asked to see it. We are offering you a free traffic funnel that will drive millions of users to your website to monetize as you please, and those users will become stuck to you when they subscribe to your feed.' And so advertisers and publishers became stuck to the platform, too, dependent on those users. The users held each other hostage, and those hostages took the publishers and advertisers hostage, too, so that everyone was locked in. Which meant it was time for the third stage of enshittification: withdrawing surplus from everyone and handing it to Facebook’s shareholders. For the users, that meant dialing down the share of content from accounts you followed to a homeopathic dose, and filling the resulting void with ads and pay-to-boost content from publishers. For advertisers, that meant jacking up prices and drawing down anti-fraud enforcement, so advertisers paid much more for ads that were far less likely to be seen by a person. For publishers, this meant algorithmically suppressing the reach of their posts unless they included an ever-larger share of their articles in the excerpt, until anything less than fulltext was likely to be be disqualified from being sent to your subscribers, let alone included in algorithmic suggestion feeds. And then FB started to punish publishers for including a link back to their own sites, so they were corralled into posting fulltext feeds with no links, meaning they became commodity suppliers to Facebook, entirely dependent on the company both for reach and for monetization, via the increasingly crooked advertising service. When any of these groups squawked, FB just repeated the lesson that every tech executive in the Darth Vader MBA: 'I have altered the deal. Pray I don’t alter it any further.' Facebook now enters the most dangerous phase of enshittification. It wants to withdraw all available surplus, and leave just enough residual value in the service to keep end users stuck to each other, and business customers stuck to end users, without leaving anything extra on the table, so that every extractable penny is drawn out and returned to its shareholders. But that’s a very brittle equilibrium, because the difference between “I hate this service but I can’t bring myself to quit it,” and “Jesus Christ, why did I wait so long to quit? Get me the hell out of here!” is razor thin All it takes is one Cambridge Analytica scandal, one whistleblower, one livestreamed mass-shooting, and users bolt for the exits, and then FB discovers that network effects are a double-edged sword. If users can’t leave because everyone else is staying, when when everyone starts to leave, there’s no reason not to go, too. That’s terminal enshittification, the phase when a platform becomes a pile of shit. This phase is usually accompanied by panic, which tech bros euphemistically call 'pivoting.' Which is how we get pivots like, 'In the future, all internet users will be transformed into legless, sexless, low-polygon, heavily surveilled cartoon characters in a virtual world called "metaverse," that we ripped off from a 25-year-old satirical cyberpunk novel.' That's the procession of enshittification. If enshittification were a disease, we'd call that enshittification's "natural history." But that doesn't tell you how the enshittification works, nor why everything is enshittifying right now, and without those details, we can't know what to do about it. What led to the enshittocene? What is it about this moment that led to the Great Enshittening? Was it the end of the Zero Interest Rate Policy? Was it a change in leadership at the tech giants? Is Mercury in retrograde? None of the above. The period of free fed money certainly led to tech companies having a lot of surplus to toss around. But Facebook started enshittifying long before ZIRP ended, so did Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Some of the tech giants got new leaders. But Google's enshittification got worse when the founders came back to oversea the company's AI panic (excuse me, 'AI pivot'). And it can't be Mercury in retrograde, because I'm a cancer, and as everyone knows, cancers don't believe in astrology. When a whole bunch of independent entities all change in the same way at once, that's a sign that the environment has changed, and that's what happened to tech. Tech companies, like all companies, have conflicting imperatives. On the one hand, they want to make money. On the other hand, making money involves hiring and motivating competent staff, and making products that customers want to buy. The more value a company permits its employees and customers to carve off, the less value it can give to its shareholders. The equilibrium in which companies produce things we like in honorable ways at a fair price is one in which charging more, worsening quality, and harming workers costs more than the company would make by playing dirty. There are four forces that discipline companies, serving as constraints on their enshittificatory impulses. First: competition. Companies that fear you will take your business elsewhere are cautious about worsening quality or raising prices. Second: regulation. Companies that fear a regulator will fine them more than they expect to make from cheating, will cheat less. These two forces affect all industries, but the next two are far more tech-specific. Third: self-help. Computers are extremely flexible, and so are the digital products and services we make from them. The only computer we know how to make is the Turing-complete Von Neumann machine, a computer that can run every valid program. That means that users can always avail themselves of programs that undo the anti-features that shift value from them to a company's shareholders. Think of a board-room table where someone says, 'I've calculated that making our ads 20% more invasive will net us 2% more revenue per user.' In a digital world, someone else might well say 'Yes, but if we do that, 20% of our users will install ad-blockers, and our revenue from those users will drop to zero, forever.' This means that digital companies are constrained by the fear that some enshittificatory maneuver will prompt their users to google, 'How do I disenshittify this?' Fourth and finally: workers. Tech workers have very low union density, but that doesn't mean that tech workers don't have labor power. The historical "talent shortage" of the tech sector meant that workers enjoyed a lot of leverage over their bosses. Workers who disagreed with their bosses could quit and walk across the street and get another job &#8211; a better job. They knew it, and their bosses knew it. Ironically, this made tech workers highly exploitable. Tech workers overwhelmingly saw themselves as founders in waiting, entrepreneurs who were temporarily drawing a salary, heroic figures of the tech mission. That's why mottoes like Google's 'don't be evil' and Facebook's 'make the world more open and connected' mattered: they instilled a sense of mission in workers. It's what Fobazi Ettarh calls 'vocational awe, 'or Elon Musk calls being 'extremely hardcore.' Tech workers had lots of bargaining power, but they didn't flex it when their bosses demanded that they sacrifice their health, their families, their sleep to meet arbitrary deadlines. So long as their bosses transformed their workplaces into whimsical 'campuses,' with gyms, gourmet cafeterias, laundry service, massages and egg-freezing, workers could tell themselves that they were being pampered &#8211; rather than being made to work like government mules. But for bosses, there's a downside to motivating your workers with appeals to a sense of mission, namely: your workers will feel a sense of mission. So when you ask them to enshittify the products they ruined their health to ship, workers will experience a sense of profound moral injury, respond with outrage, and threaten to quit. Thus tech workers themselves were the final bulwark against enshittification, The pre-enshittification era wasn't a time of better leadership. The executives weren't better. They were constrained. Their worst impulses were checked by competition, regulation, self-help and worker power. So what happened? One by one, each of these constraints was eroded until it dissolved, leaving the enshittificatory impulse unchecked, ushering in the enshittoscene. It started with competition. From the Gilded Age until the Reagan years, the purpose of competition law was to promote competition. US antitrust law treated corporate power as dangerous and sought to blunt it. European antitrust laws were modeled on US ones, imported by the architects of the Marshall Plan. But starting in the neoliberal era, competition authorities all over the world adopted a doctrine called 'consumer welfare,' which held that monopolies were evidence of quality. If everyone was shopping at the same store and buying the same product, that meant it was the best store, selling the best product &#8211; not that anyone was cheating. And so all over the world, governments stopped enforcing their competition laws. They just ignored them as companies flouted them. Those companies merged with their major competitors, absorbed small companies before they could grow to be big threats. They held an orgy of consolidation that produced the most inbred industries imaginable, whole sectors grown so incestuous they developed Habsburg jaws, from eyeglasses to sea freight, glass bottles to payment processing, vitamin C to beer. Most of our global economy is dominated by five or fewer global companies. If smaller companies refuse to sell themselves to these cartels, the giants have free rein to flout competition law further, with 'predatory pricing' that keeps an independent rival from gaining a foothold. When Diapers.com refused Amazon's acquisition offer, Amazon lit $100m on fire, selling diapers way below cost for months, until diapers.com went bust, and Amazon bought them for pennies on the dollar, and shut them down. Competition is a distant memory. As Tom Eastman says, the web has devolved into 'five giant websites filled with screenshots of text from the other four,' so these giant companies no longer fear losing our business. Lily Tomlin used to do a character on the TV show Laugh In, an AT&#38;T telephone operator who'd do commercials for the Bell system. Each one would end with her saying 'We don't care. We don't have to. We're the phone company.' Today's giants are not constrained by competition. They don't care. They don't have to. They're Google. That's the first constraint gone, and as it slipped away, the second constraint &#8211; regulation &#8211; was also doomed. When an industry consists of hundreds of small- and medium-sized enterprises, it is a mob, a rabble. Hundreds of companies can't agree on what to tell Parliament or Congress or the Commission. They can't even agree on how to cater a meeting where they'd discuss the matter. But when a sector dwindles to a bare handful of dominant firms, it ceases to be a rabble and it becomes a cartel. Five companies, or four, or three, or two, or just one company finds it easy to converge on a single message for their regulators, and without "wasteful competition" eroding their profits, they have plenty of cash to spread around. Like Facebook, handing former UK deputy PM Nick Clegg millions every year to sleaze around Europe, telling his former colleagues that Facebook is the only thing standing between 'European Cyberspace' and the Chinese Communist Party. Tech's regulatory capture allows it to flout the rules that constrain less concentrated sectors. They can pretend that violating labor, consumer and privacy laws is fine, because they violate them with an app. This is why competition matters: it's not just because competition makes companies work harder and share value with customers and workers, it's because competition keeps companies from becoming too big to fail, and too big to jail. Now, there's plenty of things we don't want improved through competition, like privacy invasions. After the EU passed its landmark privacy law, the GDPR, there was a mass-extinction event for small EU ad-tech companies. These companies disappeared en masse, and that's fine. They were even more invasive and reckless than US-based Big Tech companies. After all, they had less to lose. We don't want competition in commercial surveillance. We don't want to produce increasing efficiency in violating our human rights. But: Google and Facebook &#8211; who pretend they are called Alphabet and Meta &#8211; have been unscathed by European privacy law. That's not because they don't violate the GDPR (they do!). It's because they pretend they are headquartered in Ireland, one of the EU's most notorious corporate crime-havens. And Ireland competes with the EU other crime havens &#8211; Malta, Luxembourg, Cyprus and sometimes the Netherlands &#8211; to see which country can offer the most hospitable environment for all sorts of crimes. Because the kind of company that can fly an Irish flag of convenience is mobile enough to change to a Maltese flag if the Irish start enforcing EU laws. Which is how you get an Irish Data Protection Commission that processes fewer than 20 major cases per year, while Germany's data commissioner handles more than 500 major cases, even though Ireland is nominal home to the most privacy-invasive companies on the continent. So Google and Facebook get to act as though they are immune to privacy law, because they violate the law with an app; just like Uber can violate labor law and claim it doesn't count because they do it with an app. Uber's labor-pricing algorithm offers different drivers different payments for the same job, something Veena Dubal calls 'algorithmic wage discrimination.' If you're more selective about which jobs you'll take, Uber will pay you more for every ride. But if you take those higher payouts and ditch whatever side-hustle let you cover your bills which being picky about your Uber drives, Uber will incrementally reduce the payment, toggling up and down as you grow more or less selective, playing you like a fish on a line until you eventually &#8211; inevitably &#8211; lose to the tireless pricing robot, and end up stuck with low wages and all your side-hustles gone. Then there's Amazon, which violates consumer protection laws, but says it doesn't matter, because they do it with an app. Amazon makes $38b/year from its 'advertising' system. 'Advertising' in quotes because they're not selling ads, they're selling placements in search results. The companies that spend the most on 'ads' go to the top, even if they're offering worse products at higher prices. If you click the first link in an Amazon search result, on average you will pay a 29% premium over the best price on the service. Click one of the first four items and you'll pay a 25% premium. On average you have to go seventeen items down to find the best deal on Amazon. Any merchant that did this to you in a physical storefront would be fined into oblivion. But Amazon has captured its regulators, so it can violate your rights, and say, "it doesn't count, we did it with an app" This is where that third constraint, self-help, would sure come in handy. If you don't want your privacy violated, you don't need to wait for the Irish privacy regulator to act, you can just install an ad-blocker. More than half of all web users are blocking ads. But the web is an open platform, developed in the age when tech was hundreds of companies at each others' throats, unable to capture their regulators. Today, the web is being devoured by apps, and apps are ripe for enshittification. Regulatory capture isn't just the ability to flout regulation, it's also the ability to co-opt regulation, to wield regulation against your adversaries. Today's tech giants got big by exploiting self-help measures. When Facebook was telling Myspace users they needed to escape Rupert Murdoch’s evil crapulent Australian social media panopticon, it didn’t just say to those Myspacers, 'Screw your friends, come to Facebook and just hang out looking at the cool privacy policy until they get here' It gave them a bot. You fed the bot your Myspace username and password, and it would login to Myspace and pretend to be you, and scrape everything waiting in your inbox, copying it to your FB inbox, and you could reply to it and it would autopilot your replies back to Myspace. When Microsoft was choking off Apple's market oxygen by refusing to ship a functional version of Microsoft Office for the Mac &#8211; so that offices were throwing away their designers' Macs and giving them PCs with upgraded graphics cards and Windows versions of Photoshop and Illustrator &#8211; Steve Jobs didn't beg Bill Gates to update Mac Office. He got his technologists to reverse-engineer Microsoft Office, and make a compatible suite, the iWork Suite, whose apps, Pages, Numbers and Keynote could perfectly read and write Microsoft's Word, Excel and Powerpoint files. When Google entered the market, it sent its crawler to every web server on Earth, where it presented itself as a web-user: 'Hi! Hello! Do you have any web pages? Thanks! How about some more? How about more?' But every pirate wants to be an admiral. When Facebook, Apple and Google were doing this adversarial interoperability, that was progress. If you try to do it to them, that's piracy. Try to make an alternative client for Facebook and they'll say you violated US laws like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and EU laws like Article 6 of the EUCD. Try to make an Android program that can run iPhone apps and play back the data from Apple's media stores and they'd bomb you until the rubble bounced. Try to scrape all of Google and they'll nuke you until you glowed. Tech's regulatory capture is mind-boggling. Take that law I mentioned earlier, Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or DMCA. Bill Clinton signed it in 1998, and the EU imported it as Article 6 of the EUCD in 2001 It is a blanket prohibition on removing any kind of encryption that restricts access to a copyrighted work &#8211; things like ripping DVDs or jailbreaking a phone &#8211; with penalties of a five-year prison sentence and a $500k fine for a first offense. This law has been so broadened that it can be used to imprison creators for granting access to their own creations Here's how that works: In 2008, Amazon bought Audible, an audiobook platform, in an anticompetitive acquisition. Today, Audible is a monopolist with more than 90% of the audiobook market. Audible rrequire that all creators on their platform sell with Amazon's "digital rights management," which locks it to Amazon's apps. So say I write a book, then I read it into a mic, then I pay a director and an engineer thousands of dollars to turn that into an audiobook, and sell it to you on the monopoly platform, Audible, that controls more than 90% of the market. If I later decide to leave Amazon and want to let you come with me to a rival platform, I am out of luck. If I supply you with a tool to remove Amazon's encryption from my audiobook, so you can play it in another app, I commit a felony, punishable by a 5-year sentence and a half-million-dollar fine, for a first offense. That's a stiffer penalty than you would face if you simply pirated the audiobook from a torrent site. But it's also harsher than the punishment you'd get for shoplifting the audiobook on CD from a truck-stop. It's harsher than the sentence you'd get for hijacking the truck that delivered the CD. So think of our ad-blockers again. 50% of web users are running ad-blockers. 0% of app users are running ad-blockers, because adding a blocker to an app requires that you first remove its encryption, and that's a felony (Jay Freeman calls this 'felony contempt of business-model'). So when someone in a board-room says, 'let's make our ads 20% more obnoxious and get a 2% revenue increase,' no one objects that this might prompt users to google, 'how do I block ads?' After all, the answer is, 'you can't.' Indeed, it's more likely that someone in that board room will say, 'let's make our ads 100% more obnoxious and get a 10% revenue increase' (this is why every company wants you to install an app instead of using its website). There's no reason that gig workers who are facing algorithmic wage discrimination couldn't install a counter-app that coordinated among all the Uber drivers to reject all jobs unless they reach a certain pay threshold. No reason except felony contempt of business model, the threat that the toolsmiths who built that counter-app would go broke or land in prison, for violating DMCA 1201, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, trademark, copyright, patent, contract, trade secrecy, nondisclosure and noncompete, or in other words: 'IP law.' 'IP' is just a euphemism for 'a law that lets me reach beyond the walls of my company and control the conduct of my critics, competitors and customers.' And 'app' is just a euphemism for 'a web-page wrapped enough IP to make it a felony to mod it to protect the labor, consumer and privacy rights of its user.' We don't care. We don't have to. We're the phone company. But what about that fourth constraint: workers? For decades, tech workers' high degrees of bargaining power and vocational awe put a ceiling on enshittification. Even after the tech sector shrank to a handful of giants. Even after they captured their regulators so they could violate our consumer, privacy and labor rights. Even after they created 'felony contempt of business model' and extinguished self-help for tech users. Tech was still constrained by their workers' sense of moral injury in the face of the imperative to enshittify. Remember when tech workers dreamed of working for a big company for a few years, before striking out on their own to start their own company that would knock that tech giant over? Then that dream shrank to: work for a giant for a few years, quit, do a fake startup, get acqui-hired by your old employer, as a complicated way of getting a bonus and a promotion. Then the dream shrank further: work for a tech giant for your whole life, get free kombucha and massages on Wednesdays. And now, the dream is over. All that’s left is: work for a tech giant until they fire your ass, like those 12,000 Googlers who got fired last year six months after a stock buyback that would have paid their salaries for the next 27 years. Workers are no longer a check on their bosses' worst impulses Today, the response to 'I refuse to make this product worse' is, 'turn in your badge and don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.' I get that this is all a little depressing OK, really depressing. But hear me out! We've identified the disease. We've traced its natural history. We've identified its underlying mechanism. Now we can get to work on a cure. There are four constraints that prevent enshittification: competition, regulation, self-help and labor. To reverse enshittification and guard against its reemergence, we must restore and strengthen each of these. On competition, it's actually looking pretty good. The EU, the UK, the US, Canada, Australia, Japan and China are all doing more on competition than they have in two generations. They're blocking mergers, unwinding existing ones, taking action on predatory pricing and other sleazy tactics. Remember, in the US and Europe, we already have the laws to do this &#8211; we just stopped enforcing them in the Helmut Kohl era. I've been fighting these fights with the Electronic Frontier Foundation for 22 years now, and I've never seen a more hopeful moment for sound, informed tech policy. Now, the enshittifiers aren't taking this laying down. The business press can't stop talking about how stupid and old-fashioned all this stuff is. They call people like me 'hipster antitrust,' and they hate any regulator who actually does their job. Take Lina Khan, the brilliant head of the US Federal Trade Commission, who has done more in three years on antitrust than the combined efforts of all her predecessors over the past 40 years. Rupert Murdoch's Wall Street Journal has run more than 80 editorials trashing Khan, insisting that she's an ineffectual ideologue who can't get anything done. Sure, Rupert, that's why you ran 80 editorials about her. Because she can't get anything done. Even Canada is stepping up on competition. Canada! Land of the evil billionaire! From Ted Rogers, who owns the country's telecoms; to Galen Weston, who owns the country's grocery stores; to the Irvings, who basically own the entire province of New Brunswick. Even Canada is doing something about this. Last autumn, Trudeau's government promised to update Canada's creaking competition law to finally ban 'abuse of dominance.' I mean, wow. I guess when Galen Weston decided to engage in a criminal conspiracy to fix the price of bread &#8211; the most Les Miz-ass crime imaginable &#8211; it finally got someone's attention, eh? Competition has a long way to go, but all over the world, competition law is seeing a massive revitalization. Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher put antitrust law in a coma in the 80s &#8211; but it's awake, it's back, and it's pissed. What about regulation? How will we get tech companies to stop doing that one weird trick of adding 'with an app' to their crimes and escaping enforcement? Well, here in the EU, they're starting to figure it out. This year, the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act went into effect, and they let people who get screwed by tech companies go straight to the federal European courts, bypassing the toothless watchdogs in Europe's notorious corporate crime havens like Ireland. In America, they might finally get a digital privacy law. You people have no idea how backwards US privacy law is. The last time the US Congress enacted a broadly applicable privacy law was in 1988. The Video Privacy Protection Act makes it a crime for video-store clerks to leak your video-rental history. It was passed after a right-wing judge who was up for the Supreme Court had his rentals published in a DC newspaper. The rentals weren't even all that embarrassing! Sure, that judge, Robert Bork, wasn't confirmed for the Supreme Court, but that was because he was a virulently racist loudmouth and a crook who served as Nixon's Solicitor General. But Congress got the idea that their video records might be next, freaked out, and passed the VPPA. That was the last time Americans got a big, national privacy law. Nineteen. Eighty. Eight. It's been a minute. And the thing is, there's a lot of people who are angry about stuff that has some nexus with America's piss-poor privacy landscape. Worried that Facebook turned Grampy into a Qanon? That Insta made your teen anorexic? That TikTok is brainwashing millennials into quoting Osama Bin Laden? Or that cops are rolling up the identities of everyone at a Black Lives Matter protest or the Jan 6 riots by getting location data from Google? Or that Red State Attorneys General are tracking teen girls to out-of-state abortion clinics? Or that Black people are being discriminated against by online lending or hiring platforms? Or that someone is making AI deepfake porn of you? Having a federal privacy law with a private right of action &#8211; which means that individuals can sue companies that violate their privacy &#8211; would go a long way to rectifying all of these problems. There's a big coalition for that kind of privacy law. What about self-help? That's a lot farther away, alas. The EU's DMA will force tech companies to open up their walled gardens for interoperation. You'll be able to use Whatsapp to message people on iMessage, or quit Facebook and move to Mastodon, but still send messages to the people left behind. But if you want to reverse-engineer one of those Big Tech products and mod it to work for you, not them, the EU's got nothing for you. This is an area ripe for improvement, and I think the US might be the first ones to open this up. It's certainly on-brand for the EU to be forcing tech companies to do things a certain way, while the US simply takes away tech companies' abilities to prevent others from changing how their stuff works. My big hope here is that Stein's Law will take hold: 'Anything that can't go on forever will eventually stop' Letting companies decide how their customers must use their products is simply too tempting an invitation to mischief. HP has a whole building full of engineers thinking of new ways to lock your printer to its official ink cartridges, forcing you to spend $10,000/gallon on ink to print your boarding passes and shopping lists. It's offensive. The only people who don't agree are the people running the monopolies in all the other industries, like the med-tech monopolists who are locking their insulin pumps to their glucose monitors, turning people with diabetes into walking inkjet printers. Finally, there's labor. Here in Europe, there's much higher union density than in the US, which American tech barons are learning the hard way. There is nothing more satisfying in the daily news than the latest salvo by Nordic unions against that Tesla guy (Musk is the most Edison-ass Tesla guy imaginable). But even in the USA, there's a massive surge in tech unions. Tech workers are realizing that they aren't founders in waiting. The days of free massages and facial piercings and getting to wear black tee shirts that say things your boss doesn't understand are coming to an end. In Seattle, Amazon's tech workers walked out in sympathy with Amazon's warehouse workers, because they're all workers. The only reason the tech workers aren't monitored by AI that notifies their managers if they visit the toilet during working hours is their rapidly dwindling bargaining power. The way things are going, Amazon programmers are going to be pissing in bottles next to their workstations (for a guy who built a penis-shaped rocket, Jeff Bezos really hates our kidneys). We're seeing bold, muscular, global action on competition, regulation and labor, with self-help bringing up the rear. It's not a moment too soon, because the bad news is, enshittification is coming to every industry. If it's got a networked computer in it, the people who made it can run the Darth Vader MBA playbook on it, changing the rules from moment to moment, violating your rights and then saying 'It's OK, we did it with an app.' From Mercedes renting you your accelerator pedal by the month to Internet of Things dishwashers that lock you into proprietary dishsoap, enshittification is metastasizing into every corner of our lives. Software doesn't eat the world, it enshittifies it But there's a bright side to all this: if everyone is threatened by enshittification, then everyone has a stake in disenshittification. Just as with privacy law in the US, the potential anti-enshittification coalition is massive, it's unstoppable. The cynics among you might be skeptical that this will make a difference. After all, isn't "enshittification" the same as "capitalism"? Well, no. Look, I'm not going to cape for capitalism here. I'm hardly a true believer in markets as the most efficient allocators of resources and arbiters of policy &#8211; if there was ever any doubt, capitalism's total failure to grapple with the climate emergency surely erases it. But the capitalism of 20 years ago made space for a wild and wooly internet, a space where people with disfavored views could find each other, offer mutual aid, and organize. The capitalism of today has produced a global, digital ghost mall, filled with botshit, crapgadgets from companies with consonant-heavy brand-names, and cryptocurrency scams. The internet isn't more important than the climate emergency, nor gender justice, racial justice, genocide, or inequality. But the internet is the terrain we'll fight those fights on. Without a free, fair and open internet, the fight is lost before it's joined. We can reverse the enshittification of the internet. We can halt the creeping enshittification of every digital device. We can build a better, enshittification-resistant digital nervous system, one that is fit to coordinate the mass movements we will need to fight fascism, end genocide, and save our planet and our species. Martin Luther King said 'It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me, but it can stop him from lynching me, and I think that's pretty important.' And it may be true that the law can't force corporate sociopaths to conceive of you as a human being entitled to dignity and fair treatment, and not just an ambulatory wallet, a supply of gut-bacteria for the immortal colony organism that is a limited liability corporation. But it can make that exec fear you enough to treat you fairly and afford you dignity, even if he doesn't think you deserve it. And I think that's pretty important.

## MAGA is based on fear, not grounded in reality

date: 2024-01-30, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>A few days ago, Kristi Noem, the Republican governor of South Dakota and a MAGA hard-liner sometimes mentioned as a potential running mate for Donald Trump, warned that President Joe Biden is &#8220;remaking&#8221; America, turning us into Europe. My first thought was: So he&#8217;s going to raise our life expectancy by five or six years? In context, however, it was clear that Noem believes, or expects her audience to believe, that Europe is a scene of havoc wrought by hordes of immigrants.</p>

## Oracle quietly extends Solaris 11.4 support until 2037

date: 2024-01-30, from: OS News

Oracle has quietly extended paid support and upgrades for Solaris 11.4 to 2037 – three years past its previous deadline – and did the same for earlier versions of the OS last year. ↫ Simon Sharwood at The Register One of the biggest &#8220;what could have beens&#8221; of the past two decades. Had Oracle not closed Solaris up after acquiring Sun, an open source Solaris might&#8217;ve been something more tangible than what it is today. Of course, Oracle gonna Oracle and they were always going to screw things up, open source or not, but had Solaris stayed open we&#8217;d have had a more concerted, centralised development effort instead of what we have now, where the open source Solaris community is working off the last OpenSolaris codebase from 14 years ago.

## New renderers for GTK

date: 2024-01-30, from: OS News

Recently, GTK gained not one, but two new renderers: one for GL and one for Vulkan. Since naming is hard, we reused existing names and called them “ngl” and “vulkan”. They are built from the same sources, therefore we also call them “unified” renderers.  As mentioned already, the two renderers are built from the same source. It is modeled to follow Vulkan apis, with some abstractions to cover the differences between Vulkan and GL (more specifically, GL 3.3+ and GLES 3.0+). This lets us share much of the infrastructure for walking the scene graph, maintaining transforms and other state, caching textures and glyphs, and will make it easier to keep both renderers up-to-date and on-par. ↫ GTK Development Blog This is well above my paygrade, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s still of interest to y&#8217;all.

## In loving memory of square checkbox

date: 2024-01-30, from: OS News

But despite all this chaos and temptation, operating system vendors knew better. To this day, they follow THE convention: checkboxes are square, radio buttons are round. Maybe it was part of their internal training. Maybe they had experienced art directors. Maybe it was just luck. I don’t know — it doesn’t really matter — but — somehow — they managed to stick to the convention. Until this day. Apple is the first major operating system vendor who had abandoned a four-decades-long tradition. Their new visionOS — for the first time in the history of Apple — will have round checkboxes. ↫ Nikita Prokopov Unsightly. A lack of taste always betrays itself.

## Microsoft stole my Chrome tabs, and it wants yours, too

date: 2024-01-30, from: OS News

Last week, I turned on my PC, installed a Windows update, and rebooted to find Microsoft Edge automatically open with the Chrome tabs I was working on before the update. I don’t use Microsoft Edge regularly, and I have Google Chrome set as my default browser. Bleary-eyed at 9AM, it took me a moment to realize that Microsoft Edge had simply taken over where I’d left off in Chrome. I couldn’t believe my eyes. I never imported my data into Microsoft Edge, nor did I confirm whether I wanted to import my tabs. But here was Edge automatically opening after a Windows update with all the Chrome tabs I’d been working on. I didn’t even realize I was using Edge at first, and I was confused why all my tabs were suddenly logged out. ↫ Tom Warren at The Verge I would never accept such disregard for users from my computer.

## Garland to Undergo Surgery, US Justice Department Says

date: 2024-01-30, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Attorney General Merrick Garland will undergo back surgery this weekend and delegate his duties to the deputy attorney general during the procedure, the Justice Department said Monday. 


The news comes as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin returns to work at the Pentagon following a hospitalization related to prostate cancer that was criticized for being kept secret for days. 


Garland, 71, will be under general anesthesia during the back procedure on Saturday, which will last about 90 minutes and is "minimally invasive," said Xochitl Hinojosa, director of public affairs at the Justice Department. He is expected to return home the same day, she said. Garland will delegate his duties to Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco shortly before, during and for a short time after the procedure as he recovers from the anesthesia, the statement said. He is expected to return to work the week of February 5. 


Austin returned to the Pentagon on Monday after nearly a monthlong absence. He underwent a surgical procedure for the cancer on December 22 and was released but was then admitted to intensive care days later after experiencing extreme pain. He stayed there for two weeks but didn't inform the White House or his deputy until days later that he had cancer, had surgery or returned to the hospital.  


Austin's lack of disclosure prompted two ongoing reviews, as well as changes in federal guidelines to ensure the White House will be informed any time  Cabinet chiefs can't carry out their jobs. The Justice Department notified the White House of the plans to delegate his duties under the new guidelines, White House spokeswoman Olivia Dalton confirmed. 


When Garland went in for a routine medical procedure in 2022, his office also informed the public a week in advance and outlined how long he was expected to be out and when he would return to work.

## Credcheck version 2.4 released

date: 2024-01-30, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>Grenoble - January 30, 2024</p>
<h2>PostgreSQL credcheck extension</h2>
<p>The credcheck PostgreSQL extension provides few general credential checks, which will be evaluated during the user creation, during the password change and user renaming. By using this extension, we can define a set of rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>allow a specific set of credentials</li>
<li>reject a certain type of credentials</li>
<li>deny password that can be easily cracked</li>
<li>enforce use of an expiration date with a minimum of day for a password</li>
<li>define a password reuse policy</li>
<li>define the number of authentication failure allowed before a user is banned</li>
<li>add a delay after all authentication failure</li>
</ul>
<p>This release is a maintenance release to fix a major issue with the backup of the
password history file with pgBackRest and adds an authentication delay feature.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add authentication delay feature to be able to add a pause on authentication
    failure. Setting <code>credcheck.auth_delay_ms</code> causes the server to pause for a
    given number of milliseconds before reporting authentication failure. This
    makes brute-force attacks on database passwords more difficult.
    This patch is purely a copy/paste from the auth_delay extension just to limit the
    number of extensions to preload. See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-delay.html
    for more information about the origin of this feature.</li>
<li>Force size of file <code>$PGDATA/global/pg_password_history</code> to be a multiple of 8192
    to fix pgBackRest error caused by the error message: "page misalignment in file
    /.../global/pg_password_history: file size 2604 is not divisible by page size 8192"</li>
</ul>
<p>Extension upgrade requires a PostgreSQL restart to reload the credcheck library.</p>

## pgDay Paris 2024: Schedule published &amp; Call for lightning talks launched

date: 2024-01-30, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The schedule for pgDay Paris 2024 on March 14 is now live and we are really excited to share it with you. We have some great talks lined up for you about everything Postgres - from Codd to community and from logical decoding to LSM trees.</p>
<p>Check out the programme &amp; register now <a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgdayparis2024/schedule">https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgdayparis2024/schedule</a></p>
<p>But that’s not all!</p>
<p>The best news is that there’s still a chance for <strong>you</strong> to be on stage! If you look at the schedule, you’ll notice we reserved a slot for lightning talks because we know how much everyone loves them. We also know how nerve-wracking it can be to sign up on the day and not know until the last minute whether or not you’ll be speaking, so we’ve decided to launch a separate lightning talk CFP. Whether you’re a seasoned speaker or you’ve never been up on stage before, and whatever your Postgres use-case, we want to hear from you!</p>
<p>Submissions (max 1 per speaker) should be sent by email to lightning@pgday.paris.</p>
<p>The talk must be in English and no longer than 5 minutes.</p>
<p>The subject of your email should be your name followed by the title of the talk (e.g. “Slonik: What Elephants do for Fun”). The body of the email should contain a very short description of your talk (max 50 words)</p>
<p>We recommend you submit your lightning talk by 23 February as that's when we'll do the first round of selections, with selected speakers notified by 8 March. You can, however, submit your lightning talk right up until the day of the conference in case slots are still available </p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you in Paris on March 14, 
The pgDay Paris Team</p>

## Contexts, Friction and Distractions

date: 2024-01-30, from: Marginallia log

I get significantly more work done when I unplug my computer from the Internet.
Despite many of the tools that I use requiring a connection, and certainly the Internet containing a wealth of information that might expedite my work, these benefits are drastically outweighed by the wealth of distractions also availabe.
It&rsquo;s very appealing, when the code is compiling or the docker containers restarting, to sneak open a browser tab with hacker news, or the Χ formerly known as Twitter, youtube, or something else to pass those minutes.

## RORing ahead: using ROR in place of the Open Funder Registry

date: 2024-01-30, from: Crossref Blog

<p>A few months ago we announced our plan to <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/open-funder-registry-to-transition-into-research-organization-registry-ror/">deprecate our support for the Open Funder Registry</a> in favour of using the ROR Registry to support both affiliation and funder use cases. The feedback we’ve had from the community has been positive and supports our members, service providers and metadata users who are already starting to move in this direction.</p>
<p>We wanted to provide an update on work that’s underway to make this transition happen, and how you can get involved in working together with us on this.</p>
<p>Overall, we are building more comprehensive support for ROR into Crossref’s services. Some of this work is specifically to support using ROR to identify funding organisations in place of funder registry IDs. We have a number of parallel, complementary projects underway to support different elements of this work:</p>
<ol>
<li>We are evolving our metadata schema so that we can collect ROR IDs in places where we currently support the collection of Funder IDs.</li>
<li>We are analysing the coverage of Funder ID to ROR ID mappings and testing the way we expose them in our APIs.</li>
<li>We are developing new matching strategies to match text strings to ROR IDs.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="1-schema-updates">1. Schema updates</h2>
<p>Everything flows from being able to get ROR IDs into the Crossref metadata!</p>
<p>We are evolving our metadata schema so that we can collect ROR IDs in places where we already support the collection of Funder IDs – for instance, in <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/funder-registry/funding-data-overview/">the funding section of the metadata for works</a> and in the funder section for grants.</p>
<p>We’re working with members and service providers so that they can try sending us this data via a pipeline our Labs team has built to test schema updates before they go live. We are actively recruiting members to help us test our new pipeline by providing sample XML for registration. Planned metadata inputs and outputs are detailed in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/164h3UtBQ2mHf5lH5ZS6c_Oh8OuraoaQPvXhNNO3-Ko8/edit" target="_blank">Including ROR as a funder identifier in your metadata (metadata prototyping instructions)</a>, we’d encourage you to provide feedback on these in the document, ideally in the next two weeks.
We’re aiming to release an updated schema that supports these changes in Q1 2024.</p>
<h2 id="2-modelling-ror-idfunder-id-mappings-in-our-metadata-model">2. Modelling ROR ID/Funder ID mappings in our metadata model</h2>
<p>We have integrated the ROR registry into our evolving metadata model, and we have started work to integrate the Funder Registry. The aim is to create more flexibility in how Crossref’s metadata can be supplemented and queried, and give more clarity as to which party asserted or created a metadata element.</p>
<p>We’re working on an early iteration of how the model handles ROR IDs, funder IDs and their equivalencies. Once we have something to share, we’ll welcome community feedback on this approach and on the metadata model in general.</p>
<h2 id="3-developing-new-matching-strategies-to-match-text-strings-to-ror-ids">3. Developing new matching strategies to match text strings to ROR IDs</h2>
<p>Ideally, everyone would always use persistent identifiers to exchange information about contributor and awardee affiliations, organisations related to works, as well as funders supporting the research. In practice, this information is often exchanged as data without identifiers, such as affiliation strings (e.g. “University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA”), funder names, or even funding acknowledgements (e.g. “Funding and support generously provided by the Ford Foundation”). In such situations, a good metadata matching strategy can help map these to persistent identifiers.</p>
<p>Currently, we are focused on developing reliable strategies for matching affiliation strings to ROR IDs. In the future, we will adapt the strategies to support funder names and funding acknowledgements as well. All the strategies will be rigorously evaluated using real-life data. We will make the strategies, as well as the evaluation datasets and evaluation results, publicly available for anyone to use. If you are interested in collaborating on the development or the evaluation of the matching strategies, <a href="mailto:labs@crossref.org">please get in touch</a>!</p>
<p>In the future, we might also apply some of the new matching strategies at Crossref, to the metadata our members send us. This would allow us to insert matched identifiers to the metadata to better connect organisations with other items in the scholarly record. We already have a process that matches the names of funders supporting research against the Funder Registry and enriches the metadata with matched Funder Registry IDs. Developing and evaluating reliable matching strategies will allow us to modify this process to use ROR IDs instead, and extend it to support other use cases, such as contributor affiliations.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-the-transition-mean-for-you">What will the transition mean for you?</h2>
<p>We do recommend that you begin looking at what it will take to integrate ROR into your systems and workflows for identifying funders. Talk to your service providers about this to ready them for this change.
To reiterate the point from the earlier post, in the short term, and even in the medium term, Funder IDs aren’t going away and the Funder IDs will continue to resolve – they are persistent, after all. Eventually, however, the Funder Registry will cease to be updated, so any new funders will only be registrable in Crossref metadata with ROR IDs. Legacy Funder IDs and their mapping to ROR IDs will be maintained, so if Crossref members submit a legacy Funder ID, it will get mapped to a ROR ID automatically. Note, too, that Crossref is committed to maintaining the current funder API endpoints until ROR IDs become the predominant identifier for newly registered content. We also know that there are questions that we’ll want to tackle with the community as we all make progress, some we know and some we don’t know. With that in mind:</p>
<h2 id="tell-us-what-you-need">Tell us what you need!</h2>
<p>We want to hear from you! We have set up several channels of communication meant to ensure that you can tell both ROR and Crossref what will make this transition easier for you and that you can get answers to your questions.</p>
<p>First, we are conducting a series of Open Funder Registry user interviews designed to deepen our understanding of where Funder IDs are being used in workflows and systems. Write <a href="mailto:community@ror.org">community@ror.org</a> if you&rsquo;d like to participate in these interviews to show and tell us how you&rsquo;re using Funder IDs.</p>
<p>Second, in 2024, we will be running a follow-up to the funding data workshop we ran in June 2023. Please get in touch if your organisation would be interested in participating in the discussion.</p>

## At last, browser choice*

date: 2024-01-29, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050478/apple-ios-17-4-browser-engines-eu">EU Digital Markets Act is making waves in the Apple ecosystem</a>. For the first time ever you’ll be able to install a browser other than Safari/Webkit on iOS (as long as you live in the EU). While there are other browsers on the iOS App Store, they’re all Safari/Webkit under the hood due to non-competitive App Store submission guidelines.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/">Open Web Advocacy</a> group have spent years documenting the issues at hand. I haven’t participated much there, but I’ve built countless web apps and have felt most (if not all) the pain points that come with supporting Safari users and, as a Mobile Safari user, not having access to features I’ve built. That feature gap has closed considerably in the last couple years and the Safari/Webkit team’s movement is impressive, their relative openness on issues is welcome, and <a href="https://webkit.org/standards-positions/">declaring standards positions</a> reduces risk and removes mystery. But this (potentially) blows the doors open on competition.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what happens from here. Will we break out of the Chromium/Webkit duopoly? Or will we fall headlong into a Chromium monopoly? Regardless, the EU ruling is a win for the Open Web because now users have options beyond the OS-provided default browser. Before there was nothing beyond a thin veneer of choice.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there are <a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/this-web-page-is-best-viewed-in-the-eu/">some questions on how to test this</a> if you don’t live in the EU and it’s not yet known if (or ever) the rest of the world might also get access to other browsers. And there seems to be some malicious compliance afoot… but hopefully over time the situation normalizes towards the ideal outcome; an unfettered web.</p>
<p>Next, if the EU could fix the GDPR banners that are killing the web, that would be wonderful.</p>

	As nearly any six year old would be more than happy to tell you, the problem is never that there is too much ice cream, or too many toys, or too much screen time. Yet adults considering the political and economic challenges of decarbonizing energy systems continue to harp on the downsides of “overcapacity” — in China, specifically — of production for clean technologies, namely solar and batteries and EVs.
</p><p>
	As Heatmap’s own Robinson Meyer has 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/china-economy-clean-energy-slowdown-evs" target="_self">argued</a>, China’s monumental “overinvestment” in clean technologies may lead to trade difficulties with the United States and European Union, which are attempting to stand up cleantech production either inside their own borders or within others they’ve deemed acceptable (a concept that goes by various names, such as reshoring, nearshoring, and friendshoring) and see Chinese competition as likely to strangle these infant industries before they can stand up on their own.
</p><p>
	However accurate that view might be, it’s important to remember that China’s investments in solar and batteries are largely responsible for the immense cost declines in these technologies across the globe. Solar is now the cheapest source of electricity the world has ever seen. Inexpensive batteries allow Chinese automakers like BYD to sell electric vehicles for prices well below those traditional internal combustion vehicles.
</p><p>
	If anything, these huge investments represent a breakthrough that allows all of us to envision a clean, abundant future. If Europe and the U.S. are sour about not controlling the said future, the developing world will likely be too busy celebrating the end to their energy poverty to care.
</p><h3>Good Clean Energy Is Cheap Clean Energy</h3><p>
	As Heatmap readers likely already know, clean electrification is the skeleton key to global decarbonization. It obviously doesn’t solve everything (hello agriculture), but it’s more of a giant leap along the net zero path than a small, first step. Solar, wind, and batteries are its principal components and all have followed 
	<a href="https://macropolo.org/china-hydrogen-electrolyzers-cheap-solar/?rp=e&utm_source=MacroPolo&utm_campaign=da8174776c-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_11_27_04_41_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_791224187b-da8174776c-438642133" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">learning curves</a>--with greater production yielding price declines over and over again.
</p><p>
	China dominates global cleantech manufacturing today, and it’s investing more in production and deployment than the rest of the world. As for what that means, the International Energy Agency’s recently published 
	<a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/96d66a8b-d502-476b-ba94-54ffda84cf72/Renewables_2023.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Renewables Report</a> helps fill in the picture:
</p><ul>
<li>First, the world is going to deploy more clean electricity generating capacity in the next five years — in the main scenario, 3700 gigawatts — than has been installed in the past 100. (Note: this rapid expansion still leaves the world short of the UAE Consensus goal of tripling renewables by 2030.) Over 60% of that capacity will be deployed in a single country: China. In 2023 alone, China installed 217 GW of solar (and 76 GW of wind), absorbing a solid share of its abundant production. </li>
<br/>
<li>Second, the expansion of solar factories has been so rapid that even under the most <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/96d66a8b-d502-476b-ba94-54ffda84cf72/Renewables_2023.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accelerated deployment scenario</a>, the world will use only about 70% of the factories’ capacity. This implies further <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-26/solar-factories-slow-output-as-overcapacity-weighs-on-profits?cmpid=BBBXT012624_ENERGY&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=240126&utm_campaign=energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">price declines</a> amid a supply glut, and likely some firms <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-18/china-s-solar-manufacturers-face-fraught-2024-after-output-boom" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">going bankrupt</a>. Some of these factories will be downsized or never built. It’s important to remember that overinvestment is mostly a problem for the investors in those plants (including <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-19/china-ministry-blasts-local-officials-for-blind-ev-investments?utm_source=website&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=twitter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chinese local governments</a> who have <a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2024-01-25/guangdong-government-debt-pile-approaches-3-trillion-yuan-102160143.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">immense debt problems</a> already), not for the world. </li>
</ul><p>
	The United States has tried to defend its turf by putting 
	<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/aab661aa-d795-4033-8b57-82bc02512e28" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tariffs</a> on Chinese EVs, and the myriad subsidies for clean technologies in the Inflation Reduction Act almost all have restrictions on the country of origin as well as whether components were made by “<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-tax-credit-china-rule-2024" target="_self">foreign entities of concern</a>.” The European Union, meanwhile, launched an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/55ec498d-0959-41ef-8ab9-af06cc45f8e7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">investigation</a> into Chinese EV subsidies and is in the process of implementing its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism to try to put imports on equal footing with its internal carbon pricing scheme.
</p><p>
	While China 
	<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/shares-chinese-ev-makers-fall-after-eu-opens-anti-subsidy-probe-2023-09-14/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blasts</a> these actions as simple protectionism, there is a strong argument to be made that maintaining a politically durable coalition in favor of decarbonization inside these countries requires some degree of domestic EV production to provide good jobs. Production of these specific tradable goods takes place in factories where the prototypical good job — union, blue collar — has been located, historically. Whether decarbonization efforts should so heavily emphasize these <em>particular</em> high quality jobs instead of less tradable positions in energy installations, grid maintenance, and efficiency is an open question.
</p><p>
	Even if we accept that argument, though, it wouldn’t change the fact that what matters most for the planet is building and deploying lots of clean technologies — and continuing to get better at making and using them.
</p><p>
	This matters because the rich countries are not going to define the world’s emissions trajectory for the next 75 years. The 
	<a href="https://rhg.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rhodium-Climate-Outlook_2023.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rhodium Climate Outlook 2023</a> projects likely pathways of global emissions to 2100. It forecasts emissions will decrease from the equivalent of around 50 billion metric tons today to around 40 billion by 2060, but then rise again to around 50 billion metric tons by 2100. That reversal comes about because Rhodium sees decarbonization as both more partial and more local than it’s often imagined. Only China and the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development dramatically reduce their emissions over the next 25 years while most of the world merely holds steady — with the exception of Africa, where emissions grow substantially.
</p><p>
	All of this is because Rhodium also assumes that getting the final bits of carbon out of the global economy will be much more difficult than picking off the low-hanging fruit, as we’re doing today by moving from coal to gas and increasingly to renewables. Solar is already so cheap that it is showing up everywhere — 
	<a href="https://www.energymonitor.ai/tech/renewables/weekly-data-south-africas-unprecedented-rooftop-solar-boom/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in South Africa</a> when citizens are tired of rolling blackouts; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-11-06/nigeria-s-solar-gamble-forces-millions-in-lagos-to-unplug-from-dirty-generators" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in Nigeria</a>, stepping in for generators after diesel subsidies were reduced; even with a <a href="https://youtu.be/eflmvRX0tvU?si=jpFYfDDjcfJ0QQ95&t=65" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">random YouTuber</a> rehabbing an abandoned French chateau. Batteries are also getting cheaper and helping <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/01/20/texas-power-grid-ercot-winter-freeze" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">grids</a> in stress. Maybe <a href="https://macropolo.org/china-hydrogen-electrolyzers-cheap-solar/?rp=m" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">green hydrogen</a> will, as well.
</p><p>
	Building clean, resilient electrical grids starting as soon as possible will have immense benefits for the climate. But doing it at scale everywhere in the world is contingent on these technologies being affordable. And to date Chinese prices remain lower than in the rest of the world. Take solar: A December 2023, analysts at Wood MacKenzie priced Chinese modules at 15 cents a watt compared with 40 cents in the U.S., 30 in Europe, and 22 in India.
</p><p>
	This isn’t to say that the rest of the world should stop trying to produce more and lower costs — again, more good things are good, and adding resilience and reducing dependence on a single country has real benefits — but rather that we should remember to celebrate a bit how much of a win we’ve already seen. The point, after all, is not to win climate change, but rather to avoid it. How well we manage to do that will depend in no small part on putting rivalries aside.

## US Arms Exports Hit Record High in Fiscal 2023

date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Sales of U.S. military equipment to foreign governments in 2023 rose 16% to a record $238 billion, the U.S. State Department said on Monday, as countries sought to replenish stocks sent to Ukraine and prepare for major conflicts.  


The figures underpin expectations of stronger sales for the likes of Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman, whose shares are forecast to rise amid growing global instability. 


Arms sales and transfers are viewed as "important U.S. foreign policy tools with potential long-term implications for regional and global security," the State Department said in a statement. 


Sales approved in the year included $10 billion worth of High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) to Poland, $2.9 billion worth of AIM-120C-8 Advanced Medium-Range Air-To-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) to Germany, and National Advanced Surface to Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) to Ukraine. 


Lockheed makes the HIMARS, and RTX, formerly Raytheon, makes AMRAAM. RTX and Norway's Kongsberg produce NASAMS. 


Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics expect existing orders for hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, hundreds of Patriot missile interceptors, and a surge in orders for armored vehicles will underpin their results in coming quarters. 


There are two major ways foreign governments purchase arms from U.S. companies: direct commercial sales negotiated with a company, or foreign military sales in which a government typically contacts a Defense Department official at the U.S. embassy in its capital. Both require U.S. government approval. 


The direct military sales by U.S. companies rose to $157.5 billion in fiscal 2023 from $153.6 billion in fiscal 2022, while sales arranged through the U.S. government rose to $80.9 billion in 2023 from $51.9 billion the prior year.

## Judge Orders Oregon Newspaper Not to Publish Documents Linked to Nike Lawsuit

date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA

PORTLAND, Ore. — A federal judge has ordered an Oregon newspaper not to publish documents that it obtained regarding a sex discrimination lawsuit against sports behemoth Nike.


The Oregonian/OregonLive reported that an attorney who represents plaintiffs in the case sent the documents to one of its reporters on January 19 and then asked for them back. When the news outlet declined, the attorney filed a court motion requesting they be returned.


U.S. Magistrate Judge Jolie Russo approved the motion on Friday and ordered the news outlet to return the documents.


“The Court is aware that certain documents marked ‘Confidential’ and ‘Attorneys’ Eyes Only’ have been inadvertently disclosed by plaintiff’s counsel to the Oregonian via e-mail,” Russo wrote, ordering the outlet to return the records and “agree not to disseminate that information in any way; and to destroy any copies in its possession."


Russo said the documents fall under the case’s protective order, which withholds some content from public view.


The Oregonian/OregonLive said it planned to appeal.


“Prior restraint by government goes against every principle of the free press in this country,” said Editor and Vice President of Content Therese Bottomly. “This is highly unusual, and we will defend our First Amendment rights in court.”


Neither the attorney nor Nike immediately responded to requests for comment from The Associated Press.


The sex discrimination suit, filed in 2018, alleges Nike’s workplace is hostile toward women and that the Oregon-based company underpays female employees.


The Oregonian/OregonLive said it had previously intervened in the lawsuit as part of a media coalition that requested the court to unseal certain legal records.


The news outlet said it was working on a separate article based on independent reporting when it received the documents.

## Momaday, Pulitzer Prize Winner and Giant of Native American Literature, Dead at 89

date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK  — N. Scott Momaday, a Pulitzer Prize-winning storyteller, poet, educator and folklorist whose debut novel "House Made of Dawn" is widely credited as the starting point for contemporary Native American literature, has died. He was 89.


Momaday died Wednesday at his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, publisher HarperCollins announced. He had been in failing health.


"Scott was an extraordinary person and an extraordinary poet and writer. He was a singular voice in American literature, and it was an honor and a privilege to work with him," Momaday's editor, Jennifer Civiletto, said in a statement. "His Kiowa heritage was deeply meaningful to him and he devoted much of his life to celebrating and preserving Native American culture, especially the oral tradition."


"House Made of Dawn," published in 1968, tells of a World War II soldier who returns home and struggles to fit back in, a story as old as war itself: In this case, home is a Native community in rural New Mexico. Much of the book was based on Momaday's childhood in Jemez Pueblo, New Mexico, and on his conflicts between the ways of his ancestors and the risks and possibilities of the outside world.




"I grew up in both worlds and straddle those worlds even now," Momaday said in a 2019 PBS documentary. "It has made for confusion and a richness in my life."


Despite such works as John Joseph Mathews' 1934 release "Sundown," novels by American Indians weren't widely recognized at the time of "House Made of Dawn." A New York Times reviewer, Marshall Sprague, even contended in an otherwise favorable review that "American Indians do not write novels and poetry as a rule, or teach English in top-ranking universities, either. But we cannot be patronizing. N. Scott Momaday's book is superb in its own right."


Like Joseph Heller's "Catch-22," Momaday's novel was a World War II story that resonated with a generation protesting the Vietnam War. In 1969, Momaday became the first Native American to win the fiction Pulitzer, and his novel helped launch a generation of authors, including Leslie Marmon Silko, James Welch and Louise Erdrich.


His other admirers would range from the poet Joy Harjo, the country's first Native to be named poet laureate, to the film stars Robert Redford and Jeff Bridges.


"He was a kind of literary father for a lot of us," Harjo told The Associated Press during a telephone interview Monday. "He showed how potent and powerful language and words were in shaping our very existence."


Over the following decades, he taught at Stanford, Princeton and Columbia universities, among other top-ranking schools, was a commentator for NPR, and lectured worldwide.


He published more than a dozen books, from "Angle of Geese and Other Poems" to the novels "The Way to Rainy Mountain" and "The Ancient Child," and became a leading advocate for the beauty and vitality of traditional Native life.


Addressing a gathering of American Indian scholars in 1970, Momaday said, "Our very existence consists in our imagination of ourselves." He championed Natives' reverence for nature, writing that "the American Indian has a unique investment in the American landscape." He shared stories told to him by his parents and grandparents. He regarded oral culture as the wellspring of language and storytelling, and dated American culture back not to the early English settlers, but also to ancient times, noting the procession of gods depicted in the rock art at Utah's Barrier Canyon.


"We do not know what they mean, but we know we are involved in their meaning," he wrote in the essay "The Native Voice in American Literature."


"They persist through time in the imagination, and we cannot doubt that they are invested with the very essence of language, the language of story and myth and primal song. They are 2,000 years old, more or less, and they remark as closely as anything can the origin of American literature."


In 2007, President George W. Bush presented Momaday with a National Medal of Arts "for his writings and his work that celebrate and preserve Native American art and oral tradition." Besides his Pulitzer, his honors included an Academy of American Poets prize and, in 2019, the Dayton Literary Peace Prize.




Momaday was married three times, most recently to Barbara Glenn, who died in 2008. He had four daughters, one of whom, Cael, died in 2017.


He was born Navarre Scott Mammedaty, in Lawton, Oklahoma, and was a member of the Kiowa Nation. His mother was a writer, and his father an artist who once told his son, "I have never known an Indian child who couldn't draw," a talent Momaday demonstrably shared. His artwork, from charcoal sketches to oil paintings, were included in his books and exhibited in museums in Arizona, New Mexico and North Dakota. Audio guides to tours of the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of the American Indian featured Momaday's avuncular baritone.


After spending his teens in New Mexico, he studied political science at the University of Mexico and received a master's and Ph.D. in English from Stanford. Momaday began as a poet, his favorite art form, and the publication of "House Made of Dawn" was an unintentional result of his early reputation. Editor Fran McCullough, of what is now HarperCollins, had met Momaday at Stanford and several years later contacted him and asked whether he would like to submit a book of poems.


Momaday did not have enough for a book, and instead gave her the first chapter of "House Made of Dawn."


Much of his writing was set in the American West and Southwest, whether tributes to bears — the animals he most identified with — or a cycle of poems about the life of Billy the Kid, a childhood obsession. He saw writing as a way of bridging the present with the ancient past and summed up his quest in the poem "If I Could Ascend": 


Something like a leaf lies here within me; / it wavers almost not at all, / and there is no light to see it by / that it withers upon a black field. / If it could ascend the thousand years into my mouth, / I would make a word of it at last, / and I would speak it into the silence of the sun.


In 2019, he was the subject of a PBS "American Masters" documentary in which he discussed his belief he was a reincarnation of a bear connected to the Native American origin story around Devils Tower in Wyoming. He told The Associated Press in a rare interview that the documentary allowed him to reflect on his life, saying he was humbled that writers continued to say his work has influenced them.

## US Defense Secretary Returns to Work at Pentagon After Cancer Surgery

date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin returned to work at the Pentagon on Monday after nearly a month's absence because of prostate cancer and met with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.


“At this important time, I’m glad to be back at the Pentagon,” said Austin, speaking at the start of the meeting. "I feel good and am recovering well, but still recovering, and I appreciate all the good wishes that I have received thus far.”


After that session, Austin went to the White House Situation Room for a meeting of the national security team to discuss the drone attack at a base in Jordan that killed three U.S. troops and wounded several dozen others.


He was last in the Pentagon on December 21. He had been diagnosed with prostate cancer earlier in December, and he went to a hospital for a surgical procedure for the cancer on December 22. He worked the following week from home.


On January 1, he was taken by ambulance to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center after experiencing extreme pain and was admitted to the intensive care unit. He stayed there for two weeks but didn’t inform the White House or his deputy that he had cancer, had surgery or had been taken back to the hospital and put in intensive care until days later. He told President Joe Biden and other key leaders about his diagnosis only after he’d been in the hospital more than a week.


Austin's lack of disclosure has prompted changes in federal guidelines and has triggered an internal Pentagon review and an inspector general review into his department’s notification procedures. Both reviews are ongoing.




Austin has been working from home since he got out of the hospital on January 15, and he made his first public appearance early last week during a virtual Ukraine contact defense group meeting. He gave opening remarks for the meeting via video camera that was streamed online.


Doctors at Walter Reed said on Friday that Austin's prostate cancer prognosis is excellent and no further treatments will be needed. He saw doctors for a checkup on Friday.


Austin has been criticized for keeping secret his prostate cancer diagnosis, surgery and subsequent hospitalization with complications from the procedure.


He was diagnosed in early December and had what the Pentagon described as a “minimally invasive surgical procedure,” called a prostatectomy, to treat the cancer on December 22. He was under general anesthesia during this procedure and had transferred some authorities to his deputy defense secretary, Kathleen Hicks.

## China Decries Interrogations, Deportations of Students at US Entry Points

date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA

Beijing — The Chinese government has protested to the United States over the treatment of Chinese arriving to study in America, saying some have been interrogated for hours, had their electronic devices checked and in some cases were forcibly deported from the country.


Xie Feng, the Chinese ambassador in Washington, said dozens of Chinese have been denied entry every month for the past few months when returning to school from overseas travel or visiting relatives in China, according to a post on the Chinese Embassy website.


“When they landed at the airport, what awaited them was an eight-hour-long interrogation by officers who prohibited them from contacting their parents, made groundless accusations against them and even forcibly repatriated them and banned their entry,” he said Sunday at an event at the embassy on student exchanges. “This is absolutely unacceptable.”


The protest comes as the U.S. and China try to boost student and other exchanges to shore up their relations, which have turned confrontational in recent years over trade, technology, human rights and, more fundamentally, the future direction of the world.


Nearly 290,000 Chinese students are in the U.S., about one-third of the foreign students in the country, according to the embassy post. China has more than 1.3 million students studying abroad, more than any other country, it said.


In a separate online statement, the Chinese Embassy said it had made “solemn representations” to the U.S. government about the treatment of students arriving at Dulles airport in Washington, D.C. The statement reminded Chinese students to be cautious when entering through the airport.


It wasn't clear whether Xie's comments referenced cases only at Dulles or at other entry points as well.


The U.S. Embassy in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


The Chinese Embassy statement said the affected students had their electronic devices checked, were prohibited from communicating with anyone outside and, in some cases, held for more than 10 hours. It said the actions of border control officers “have had a serious impact on the studies of international students from China and caused great psychological harm.”


The statement also said that the actions ran counter to the agreement between Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping at their meeting last November to promote people-to-people exchanges.

For one thing, the administration’s LNG pause is a literal challenge to the existing <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2018/06/f52/Macroeconomic%20LNG%20Export%20Study%202018.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">methodology</a> for assessing LNG projects, developed under the Trump administration back in 2018. The timing of the announcement further marks it as an opening salvo to young climate-conscious voters whose faith in the president suffered a <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-s-climate-betrayal" target="_self">bruising</a> when he approved a ConocoPhillips oil exploration effort known as the <a href="https://www.conocophillips.com/operations/alaska/willow-project/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Willow Project</a> last spring. There could be some strategy here on the part of the campaign, as well — by baiting Trump into taking up LNG as a low-hanging talking point, it gets to amplify and contrast Biden’s climate agenda repeatedly in response.</p><p>But it’s a risky gambit. Attacks on LNG <a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/howarth-natural-gas" target="_blank">might not be as simple</a> as they look at first glance — that is, after all, what the Energy Department’s review is all about, although it also likely kicks the decision to, conveniently, after Election Day. <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/inflation-reduction-act-popularity-repeal" target="_self">Heatmap polling</a> also shows Americans aren’t very familiar with Biden’s landmark climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, even as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/27/climate/biden-climate-campaign.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">experts believe</a> “climate voters could make or break Joe Biden in 2024.” I fear Americans’ eyes will glaze over at yet another three-letter acronym — not that “<em>liquified natural gas export terminals</em>” is exactly any better. At the very least, other polling appears to indicate a public that is <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/06/28/what-americans-think-about-an-energy-transition-from-fossil-fuels-to-renewables/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">confused and conflicted</a> about fossil fuels, see-sawing between a desire for energy security and anxiety over climate priorities. </p><p>Meanwhile, Trump can add LNG to his <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change-wind-solar-electric-vehicles-energy" target="_self">laundry list of dubious attacks</a> on the energy transition and the “Green New Scam.”</p><p>Of course, none of these risks is a reason for the Biden administration not to get to the bottom of LNG’s environmental impacts. The U.S. is, after all, now the largest <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=60361" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LNG exporter</a> in the world. But the timing of the Biden administration’s announcement, just as the Republican race took a decisive and seemingly inevitable <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-new-hampshire-primary-two-candidate-race-72a59c4133879eaeec63d6ed30e91e01" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">turn in Trump’s favor</a>, means that one way or another, we’ll be hearing a lot more about LNG in the long, long months to come.</p>

## Ex-IRS Contractor Sentenced to 5 Years for Leaking Trump Tax Records

date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA

Washington — A former contractor for the U.S. Internal Revenue Service was sentenced by a judge on Monday to five years in prison on Monday for leaking the tax records of former President Donald Trump and thousands of other wealthy Americans to media organizations.


Charles Littlejohn, 38, in October had pleaded guilty to a charge of disclosing income tax return information without authorization.  


U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes decided on his sentence.  


Federal prosecutors had sought a five-year sentence, the maximum allowed under U.S. law, arguing that Littlejohn was motivated by a political agenda and compromised the security of sensitive personal information. Littlejohn, according to prosecutors, sought a position at a consulting firm that works with the IRS in 2017 in hopes of accessing and disclosing records on Trump, who was president at the time.


Littlejohn's lawyers said he was motivated by a "deep, moral belief" that the public had a right to know the information he shared, but now regrets his actions. Littlejohn's legal team did not request a specific sentence, but sought a punishment comparable to prior government leakers.  


Littlejohn secretly downloaded years of Trump's tax records in 2018, later sharing them with reporters from the New York Times, according to court documents. The newspaper published a series of articles in 2020 revealing that Trump paid no income tax in 10 of the 15 years before he was elected president.


Trump became the first major U.S. presidential candidate in decades not to release his tax returns when he ran for the White House in 2016. A U.S. House of Representatives panel released six years of his tax records in 2022 after a court battle.


Littlejohn later leaked tax information on "ultra-high net worth taxpayers" to the investigative news outlet ProPublica. He was motivated by concerns about economic inequality and wanted to spur reforms to the U.S. tax system, his defense team wrote in court documents.  


ProPublica published nearly 50 articles based on the information, revealing how the wealthy evade income taxes in the United States.


The nearly 6,000 pages of records released by the House panel in 2022 included more than 2,700 pages of personal returns from Trump and his wife Melania Trump, plus more than 3,000 pages of returns from his businesses. They showed that Trump's income and tax liability fluctuated dramatically from 2015 through 2020 and that he and his wife claimed large deductions and losses, and paid little or no income tax in several of those years.

## US Offers Reward for Escaped Sudan Official Wanted on Darfur

date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The United States on Monday offered a reward of up to $5 million for the arrest of a former Sudanese official sought over alleged Darfur war crimes who escaped from prison when war erupted last year.


Ahmed Harun, a former top aide to deposed dictator Omar al-Bashir, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for helping form the notorious Janjaweed militia which carried out a scorched-earth campaign in Darfur in the 2000s.


Harun announced in April that he and other former regime officials escaped Khartoum's Kober prison days after fighting broke out between Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.


The United States pointed out that the Janjaweed has evolved into the Rapid Support Forces, which is accused of ethnic-based attacks against the non-Arab population in western Sudan.


"Lasting peace in Sudan requires justice for victims and accountability for those responsible for human rights abuses and violations, both past and present," State Departments spokesman Matthew Miller said.


"There is a clear and direct connection between impunity for abuses under the Bashir regime, including those of which Harun is accused, and the violence in Darfur today," he said.


Secretary of State Antony Blinken has accused the Rapid Support Forces of crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing in the latest bloodshed.


The United States has worked with Saudi Arabia to broker between the dueling generals but to little avail.


The war has killed at least 13,000 people, according to a conservative estimate by the Conflict Location and Event Data project, and displaced more than seven million people, according to the U.N.


The International Criminal Court has sought Harun since 2007 over 20 counts of crimes against humanity and 22 counts of war crimes. In 2009, Bashir became the first sitting head of state indicted by the Hague-based court, but Sudan has not handed him over.


The reward by the United States -- which itself is not party to the court -- is offered for information that leads to Harun's arrest, transfer or conviction.

## An inbox full o’ opportunities

date: 2024-01-29, from: Dave Rupert blog

<browser-window shadow grayscale>
<div class="post-content">
<p>Hi Dave Rupert LLC,</p>
<p>I liked your latest blog post <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/08/quick-thoughts-on-chips/">Quick toughts on chips</a> and see you are a business leader in accessibility, Doritos®, and Jekyll blogging software. I thought we should connect. I would like to inform you of an exciting opportunity.</p>
<p>I scraped or stole your email address from some list that you never signed up for, but would you like help growing your company’s sales? I can do the same impersonal, unsolicited, scumbag sales shit I’m doing to you right now but on behalf of your company.</p>
<p>I generated this with AI, so it took me literally no time or effort but I sent it anyways. The federal crime I just committed is utterly offensive and every time I send this to you under a different fake business name you instantly delete it, but some might also call it “innovative”. I can provide this service for your company. Reach new customers today by deploying large scale AI-driven spam operations.</p>
<p>I clearly have no ethics, but you should enter a business relationship with me, a guy who found your email on the internet.</p>
<p>You are now signed up for a no-opt-out email drip campaign to send you automated replies every day for the next week to get you to reply. Reply and start a conversation with your harasser if you’d like it to stop.</p>
<p>Also, would you like to have my boss on your podcast? He’s a B2B Growth Saas Fortune Trope 500 Under 500 Startups Entreprenuer and has a red Porsche. There’s almost no trace of this guy on the internet but you should absolutely have him on your super niche web development podcast. I think he’d be a great fit for your audience.</p>
<p>What do you say? Are you ready to increase the size of your revenue?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Helen</p>

## US Schools Not Immune From Rise in Hate Crimes

date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA

Washington  — Schools in the United States are not being spared from a dramatic rise in hate crimes that has swept across the country.


A new report released Monday from the Federal Bureau of Investigation finds that 10% of all hate crimes in the U.S. in 2022 took place at schools, making them the country's third most common location for hate crimes.


Only homes (27%) and highways, roads or alleys (16%) saw more hate crime offenses.


The report found that the number of reported hate crimes at schools — from preschool through university — has risen steadily since 2020, when officials recorded 500 hate crimes at school. In 2021, the number of school-based offenses rose to 896 before hitting a high of more than 1,300 in 2022.


Those increases track with what FBI officials have described as a worrisome rise in hate crimes overall, with the latest data showing a record 11,643 incidents in 2022, surpassing the previous record of almost 11,000 incidents in 2021.




Monday's report is the first of its kind issued by the FBI, and officials say it is not clear yet whether they will issue additional reports on school-based hate crimes in the future.


"The goal is to draw attention to the data and to the occurrences of hate crimes at schools giving possibly others the opportunity to respond," an FBI official told reporters Monday, briefing on the condition of anonymity under ground rules established by the bureau.


"[This is] not a situation here where the bureau is looking to take immediate action on this," the official added. "But by providing the information, we think that it enables our law enforcement partners to do so."


The report, which looked at data from the five-year period covering 2018 to 2022, found the most common hate crime offense was intimidation, followed by vandalism and assault.


The most common hate crimes were anti-Black crimes (12.6%), followed by anti-Jewish crimes (5.6%) and anti-Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual or Transgender crimes (2.6%).


Anti-Muslim hate crimes were 0.5% of the total.


The FBI report also found that hate crimes in schools were more frequent in October, November and December, with nearly a third of school-based hate crimes taking place during those months.


Overall, the report said that more than 30% of children who were victims of hate crimes over the five-year period were victimized at school. Almost 36% of juvenile hate crime offenders committed the crimes in school.


Almost two-thirds of the reported hate crimes took place in preschools, elementary schools and high schools, according to the FBI data.

<p>Some buy now, pay later platforms are testing out a new model: subscription plans. For these companies, it’s another guaranteed revenue stream and maybe a way to lock in loyal customers. But can they work when paying later is the whole point?

## Disinformation often gets blamed for swaying elections, but the research isn’t so clear

Many countries face general elections this year. Political campaigning will include misleading and even false information.

## Berlin School

date: 2024-01-29, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Berlin School</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m listening to <a href="https://yt.cdaut.de/watch?v=BE8rMsM3zLs">Berlin Schoool: An Uncomplicated Approach</a> by Synth Seeker because <a class="account" href="https://social.sdf.org/@phf" title="@phf@social.sdf.org">@phf</a> recommended it.</p>

<p>We were talking about music. All I do is create small jingles for my podcast but every now and then I wonder about music theory.
A while ago I had saved <a href="https://yewtu.be/watch?v=rgaTLrZGlk0">Learn music theory in half an hour</a> by Andrew Huang to get back to it.
But all I had done about it was think to myself: Pick a scale, like this one, B Major looks nice, OK, so full full half full full full half, that’s these keys, OK, let me doodle around on these … beep beep boop boop … here we go. Or maybe do the other one, full full full half full full half … biep biep boup boup … all right! 🥳</p>

<p>But then I wonder: what would my next step be? Some days I look at the circle of fifth and wonder if that’s hogwash. Non-European music doesn&rsquo;t need it! But then again, they also use <em>something</em>. There are rules because people figured out what generally &ldquo;works&rdquo;. Well, on the other hand there are books about many things and they are neither a replacement for spending ten thousand hours practising and the rules they espouse are often just there to get you started and then they are immediately broken.</p>

<p>All I know when I look at a typical drum machine or tracker setup with <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> or similar I immediately want to do a <a href="https://babayagamusic.com/Music/nine-eight-rhythms.htm"><sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> Karsilama</a> or something like that. My wife&rsquo;s oriental dancing and all the Turkish, Arab, Iranian and Maghreb music we listened to must have left an impression… Or confused the hell out of me, depending on your perspective. Or mine.</p>

<p>Anyway, writing all of this and I&rsquo;m still not making music. What next, I wonder. Perhaps playing C Major and playing a bunch of notes it shares with another scale and then continuing with that scale is cool. Or maybe not. I don&rsquo;t know. Or just stay in that scale and do some drum machine and patterns below that!</p>

<p>That Synth Seeker video had a link to a <a href="https://www.hooktheory.com/cheat-sheet">Key Cheat Sheet Index</a>. The effect is similar to picking scales in Garage Band or Animoog: limiting the keys I use in order to stay in that scale. Works for me!</p>

<p>All this listening and writing makes me realize that it&rsquo;s Sunday, late at night, I should go to bed, and then I&rsquo;ll be working and playing role-playing games and war-games every evening until the next week-end comes around. Whaaat!</p>

<p>I must find time between the things I do to do the other things.</p>

<p>This is my life.</p>

<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/29/daveAndDaveOnPotreroHill.png"></center>The Daves (Jacobs and Winer) at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potrero_Hill">Potrero Hill</a> restaurant in the 90s.</div></p>
<p>We had already been friends for a few years then. By total coincidence we were both offered writing gigs at the then-new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine)#History">Wired</a>, Dave as the Fetish columnist, where he wrote about all the latest tech gadgetry, which was a perfect assignment for him, because Dave is one of the most tech-literate people you'll ever meet. Also an avid bike rider, Deadhead, and later a receiver of donated kidneys, and a pioneer of the technology for matching kidney donors with recipients. He has saved a lot of lives with his software. And he's still with us, against all odds. </p>
<p>I was offered a column to basically write whatever I wanted to write about, although by default I was supposed to write about the world wide web, which was then as new as ChatGPT is today and every bit as exciting. You can find our respective columns somewhere I hope on the web. </p>
<p>Just chatted with him last night during the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39413785/niners-beat-lions-nfc-championship-game-reach-super-bowl">Niners game</a>.

## VASL Templates

date: 2024-01-29, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>VASL Templates</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get <a href="https://vasl-templates.org/">VASL Templates</a> to run on my laptop so that I can create nice setups for Advanced Squad Leader. As it turns out, I have to use <code>pipx</code> because that automatically creates virtual environments for me, as far as I understand.</p>

<pre><code>cd src
git clone https://code.pacman-ghost.com/public/vasl-templates.git
cd vasl-templates
pipx install .
</code></pre>

<p>As it turns out, this is not enough:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/bin/vasl-templates&quot;, line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    from vasl_templates.main import main
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/pipx/venvs/vasl-templates/lib/python3.11/site-packages/vasl_templates/main.py&quot;, line 19, in &lt;module&gt;
    import PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5'
</code></pre>

<p>So now you need to install PyQt5 into the virtual environment used by vasl-templates:</p>

<pre><code>pipx inject vasl-templates PyQt5
</code></pre>

<p>Next error:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/bin/vasl-templates&quot;, line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    from vasl_templates.main import main
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/pipx/venvs/vasl-templates/lib/python3.11/site-packages/vasl_templates/main.py&quot;, line 19, in &lt;module&gt;
    import PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets'
</code></pre>

<p>Fix:</p>

<pre><code>pipx inject vasl-templates PyQtWebEngine
</code></pre>

<p>And now it works at last! 😅</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Advanced_Squad_Leader">#Advanced Squad Leader</a></p>

## Config Management

date: 2024-01-29, from: Miek Giebin blog

this project needs a name and a domain.
After many years of playing with YAML in k8s, I&rsquo;ve returned to using CFEngine (at work). The last config management software before that was Puppet. An issue I see with all modern config management tooling is the lack of monitoring and the impossibility to cleanly roll back. In k8s it works better, but that&rsquo;s only for pods running in k8s (which are stateless), not the underlying machines.

## EV Earnings on Deck

date: 2024-01-29, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDM0MDAwMC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODQzODE2Nn0.7qLtGHwtvJDuHPOt-W4Ue-pqu3d_1ggV3S7sxzg1utg/image.png?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C1%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p>
<em><strong>Current conditions: </strong>Warm temperatures in the Pacific Northwest and Central Plains could set daily records • Jet stream to dump “extended” rain on California • It’ll hit nearly 60 degrees today in Kansas City, whose Chiefs are headed to the Super Bowl for the fourth time in five years to face the San Francisco 49ers.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3><strong></strong>1. Earnings calls continue — and with them, EV insights</h3><p>
	Earnings season continues this week with 106 S&P 500 companies on deck 
	<a href="https://advantage.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_012624A.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to report to investors</a> in the next five days. Upcoming calls with automakers in particular could offer additional insight into the <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/are-ev-sales-really-slowing-data" target="_self">purported</a> “slowing” of the electric vehicle market. Here is where things currently stand:
</p><ul>
<li>General Motors <strong>reports Tuesday</strong>. In December, the company halted sales of its 2024 Chevrolet Blazer EV over issues with software and charging, and it postponed a $4 billion electric truck plant in Michigan last year as well. GM says it sold <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/01/03/gm-q4-sales-ultium-grows-bolt-ends-best-year-ever-as-gm-has-3-1-ev-share/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">19,469</a> EVs in Q4, down slightly from the quarter before.</li>
<li>Ford reports <strong>next week</strong>. The company has significantly reduced production of its <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/pickup-trucks-sedans-ford-f150-lightning-tesla-model-3" target="_self">F-150 Lightning</a>.</li>
<li>Polestar’s Q4 results won’t be released until the <strong>end of February</strong>, but the Volvo-owned brand “cut about 15% of its global workforce [last week] in response to what it described as ‘challenging market conditions’ and lower volume expectations in 2025,” <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/ev-2024-bad-start-96146554" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Last week</strong>, Tesla projected “notably slower” growth for the year ahead. The company “is clearly trying to figure out what to do next,” <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/tesla-earnings-call-model-y-3-cybertruck" target="_self">wrote</a> <em>Heatmap</em>’s Matthew Zeitlin.</li>
</ul><h3>2. EU climate chief warns against ‘false narrative’ that climate action and business interests are at odds</h3><p>
	The European Union’s climate commissioner, Wopke Hoekstra, said that the energy transition will mean a “heavy change” for industries on the continent but warned against the “false narrative” that climate action comes at the cost of business and innovation, 
	<em>The Financial Times</em> <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a5c5b266-788a-4f2f-a5b2-5e27e54e3855" target="_blank">reported</a> Monday. Hoekstra’s comments came ahead of an intended proposal by Brussels that the EU cut emissions by 90% of 1990 levels by 2040.
</p><p>
	While the aggressive proposition would need to be agreed upon by EU governments before becoming law, environmental regulations have already rankled farmers in Germany, Poland, Romania, Belgium, and France — where 
	<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/france-farmers-protests-fuel-tax-cut-red-tape" target="_blank">farmers</a> even threatened to put Paris “<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/french-farmers-aim-put-paris-siege-tractor-protest-106746513" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">under siege</a>” on Monday — while right-wing politicians have attacked green policies and industrialists have blamed “red tape” for holding up innovation. “We need to stand on two legs: one leg is climate action, the other leg is the just transition, competitiveness, and a thriving business community, because both are needed,” Hoekstra said.
</p><h3>3. Food sustainability activists chuck soup at the Mona Lisa </h3><p>
<strong></strong>On Sunday, a pair of activists <a href="https://x.com/riposte_alim/status/1751554606964900049?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">threw soup</a> at the Mona Lisa in the Louvre museum in Paris — although Leonardo da Vinci’s painting, which has <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-10-31/climate-change-food-protest-art-museums" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seen this kind of thing before</a> and resides safely behind fortified glass, was not damaged.

Chicago faces uphill battle to ban gas from new construction</h3><p>
	Last week, Chicago Mayor Mayor Brandon introduced an ordinance that would ban natural gas for cooking and heating in most new construction. “This is a critical first step for [Chicago] to take towards a planned transition away from fossil fuels,” Leslie Perkins, the chief of staff and policy director for the city’s Committee on Environmental Protection and Energy, 
	<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/chicago-mayor-natural-gas-ban-new-buildings-electrification-decarbonization-emissions/705736/#:~:text=Chicago%20Mayor%20Brandon%20Johnson%20introduced,Johnson%20in%20supporting%20the%20legislation." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em>Utility Drive</em> at the time. However, the ordinance faces an uphill battle, <em>The Chicago Tribune</em> argued in <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-editorial-natural-gas-brandon-johnson-stoves-utilities-20240128-bkb4u53l3vcbbg6ae5z2fusoqm-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a Sunday editorial</a>. “Better to wait and see what the statewide policy is on the future of natural gas,” the authors wrote, stressing examples like Berkeley, California, which has been unable to enforce its version of a gas ban after a federal appeals court ruled the city doesn’t have the authority. Additionally, “much of the power keeping lights on in Chicagoland comes from nuclear energy (which doesn’t emit carbon) and, ironically enough, gas (which does),” the op-ed authors pointed out. “It’s not economically feasible to build new nuclear plants at present, so any increased electricity demand will be met mostly by burning gas.”
</p><h3>5. Maui County identifies 100th and final Lahaina wildfire victim</h3><p>
	Over the weekend, Maui police identified the 100th victim of the August 8 Lahaina wildfire as Lydia Coloma, 70. She was also the last unidentified victim and was ID’ed using “the context of the location where the remains were found,” rather than by DNA or other methods, 
	<em>The Associated Press</em> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/maui-fires-victims-identified-ca4cb48475dedc5d7402047bd94d6bc7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports.</a>
</p><p>
	Coloma is one of 
	<a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/beat/maui-police-identify-100th-known-victim-of-the-lahaina-fire/" target="_blank">nine members of her family</a> who died in the wildfire, as well as the first victim to be identified since November 11. Police said three other people still remain unaccounted for, down from more than 1,000 in the immediate aftermath of the fire.
</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p>
<em>“What lies for the future for the Osage? Energy is the front end of our business. The other part of it is the environmental stewardship of this reservation.”</em> —Everett Waller, chairman of the Osage Minerals Council, who also plays Paul Red Eagle in <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em>. A federal judge has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/for-the-osage-this-centurys-fight-is-over-wind-turbines-c7c3e922" target="_blank">sided</a> with the Osage Nation against Italian utility Enel, which has been ordered to remove 84 wind turbines from tribal land found in violation of the Osage mineral estate.

## How worried should we be about rising credit card debt?

date: 2024-01-29, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Consumer spending ticked up in December, and more people are swiping their credit cards. Part of the reason folks are more comfortable putting it on plastic is confidence in the overall job market. But delinquency rates have been climbing too.

## Warm Winters Won’t Make You Happier

date: 2024-01-29, from: Heatmap News

Or is it just the end of January? </p>
<p>It can be difficult to tell. We’re officially in the thick of what Americans consider to be the <a href="https://today.yougov.com/society/articles/45312-americans-favorite-and-least-favorite-months-year" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">worst time of year</a>, when complaining about the weather is an acceptable salutation and feeling “blah” is the basic condition of being alive. Even setting aside seasonal affective disorder — a condition linked to <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/seasonal-affective-disorder#:~:text=Seasonal%20affective%20disorder%2C%20or%20SAD,antidepressants%20can%20help%20treat%20SAD." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">limited daylight</a>, and thus not <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-environment-watch/michigan-winters-are-super-cloudy-and-getting-worse-heres-how-deal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">directly affected</a> by climate change — <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17456916231178695" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">studies have shown</a> that people have a lower quality diet in the winter, and body weight usually reaches its peak this time of year. Physical activity, which is also important for mental health, dips as the weather gets worse, and research has even shown that people with Alzheimer’s disease experience more severe symptoms when the planet is tilted away from the sun.</p>
<p>Some have taken these winter blues as an opportunity to question the basic premise that climate change is bad. “The chief benefits of global warming” include “fewer winter deaths” and lower heating bills, Matt Ridley <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/why-climate-change-is-good-for-the-world/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">argued</a> in <em>The Spectator </em>in 2013. Former President Donald Trump even <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/01/its-cold-so-trump-is-doubting-climate-change/580885/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has a quasi-annual tradition</a> of tweeting something like <em>“Wouldn’t be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right now!” </em>during cold snaps this time of year.</p>
<p>Winter is, in fact, warming <a href="https://heatmap.news/what-is-winter-anymore" target="_self">faster than any other season</a> in the United States, with some parts of the country on track to lose over a month of freezing days as soon as 2050. Even if you do believe — correctly — that climate change is a global catastrophe, unless you’re <a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/ski-snowboard-season-snow-climate-change" target="_self">a skier or snowboarder</a>, this might sound like a good thing. So, as sacrilegious as it feels to ask, <em>could</em> a warmer planet make us healthier in the wintertime? </p>
<p>When I asked Leslie Davenport, a climate psychology educator at the California Institute of Integral Studies, if she expected milder winters to impact people psychologically, she answered immediately. “Oh, one hundred percent!,” she told me. That doesn’t mean she thinks the impact will be positive. She said she has heard people “who are a little more on the climate denial end of things” make comments like “this is great, it used to be so cold and now I can go golfing,” she told me, but “I can’t honestly call that an upside.” </p><p>Far more often, Davenport said she hears from people experiencing a sense of “unsettling” as they notice winter isn’t as cold or as snowy as they remember it being. Some might even express a feeling of “solastalgia,” a neologism that describes the sense of displacement or nostalgia that arises when a place changes environmentally. “Whether it’s the loss of snow, or areas that are drier or hotter or wetter, it is like, ‘Well, this is not the town I grew up in or the place I chose to move to because it has changed so much,’” Davenport said.</p><p>While there might be an abstract appeal to the Los Angelesification of winter nationwide, it would be a mistake to count on climate change making the season “better.” Quite the opposite, actually — warmer winters could make winter much <em>worse</em>, especially for those living in midlatitude cities like New York, London, or Amsterdam. “I have observed, in my travels and my research and in talking to people, that it is often much easier and more pleasant to cope with winter weather that is slightly below freezing consistently than weather that is slightly above freezing consistently,” Kari Leibowitz, a health psychologist who is working on a book about <a href="https://www.karileibowitz.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">winter mindsets</a>, told me.</p>
<p>Cold temperatures can actually improve our lives in several ways, Leibowitz argued. For one thing, snowfall “opens up a whole bunch of winter opportunities” like sledding, snowmobiling, snowshoeing, and all those winter sports that get people out of the house. That helps combat some of the bluesiness that otherwise comes from moping around indoors when it’s too gray and rainy to do anything active. Frozen lakes offer opportunities for skating and hockey, plus “there’s also a lot of beauty and intrigue in ice — you know, icicles and frozen rainstorms,” Leibowitz went on.</p><p>Snow, meanwhile, “reflects the light, so it makes the darkness of winter feel much, much brighter,” Leibowitz said. “And most people think it’s really beautiful — it’s clean and fresh and it smells good.” </p><p>Of course, winter weather can be dangerous, too, but “places that are colder and have really frozen winters have good infrastructure for dealing with that, and houses tend to be better insulated and heated more efficiently,” Leibowitz said. Bad winter weather can also give us much-needed <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/02/why-adults-still-love-snow-days/606481/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">permission to rest</a>. </p><p>While there are certain places further in the south, such as Atlanta, where winter might genuinely become more pleasant as the planet warms, “there are far more places where the end of winter is just going to mean places are dark and wet,” without the upsides that come with the snow and freezing temperatures, Leibowitz stressed. </p><p>Michael Varnum, the head of the Culture and Ecology Laboratory at Arizona State University and a specialist in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17456916231178695" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seasonal psychology</a>, did find one positive. “Nobody likes to feel down, or to look at their waistline and see it’s grown,” he told me. “So potentially, there could be some upsides there.”</p>
<p>Naturally, much of how you feel about winter will depend on the climate where you live. In general, though, “we are somewhat more insulated from the changes in temperature that come with the seasons than we were, say, 10,000 years ago or even a couple hundred years ago,” Varnum said. Feelings of climate anxiety and distress tend to be highest in Indigenous communities in or near the Arctic, where the cold weather is a part of cultural identity and inheritance. Likewise, Davenport told me, in “places where there tends to be a lot of snow” like Japan or Finland, “there’s talk about things like ‘winter grief,’” where a milder winter makes it so that “certain rituals or holidays that have been planned in the past can’t happen anymore or as consistently.”</p><p>Many Americans, too, <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/fifth-national-climate-assessment-america" target="_self">lose a sense of themselves</a> when winter gets milder. “It’s what a lot of us love about living here: our winters,” Erich Osterberg, a Dartmouth climate scientist, <a href="https://newhampshirebulletin.com/2022/01/06/losing-winter-and-big-chunks-of-new-hampshires-identity/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>The New Hampshire Bulletin</em></a> in 2022. “It’s more than changes to the climate,” he added, “it’s changes to our livelihood and our culture.” I encountered similar comments from Minnesotans when I was looking into how an unseasonably dry winter is imperiling this year’s cross country ski season: “Spiritually, this is terrible,” Claire Wilson, the executive director of Minneapolis’ Loppet Foundation, recently <a href="https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-climate-change-warm-winter-december-2023-laura-yuen-sven-sundgaard-world-cup-loppet/600332632/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told the <em>Star Tribune</em></a>.</p><p>Winter doesn’t have to be dreaded, Leibowitz said — much of one’s enjoyment of the season comes down to <a href="https://www.karileibowitz.com/winter-mindset" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mindset</a>. But it does seem to matter that winter is actually, well, <em>wintery</em>, too. Whether that’s a question of our evolutionary seasonal biology (winter appears to be an important trigger for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/12/12/winter-mood-sex-concentration-diet/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the human reproductive cycle</a>, for one thing), or a matter of our cultural practices, or something as simple as snow being more fun than rain, it’s hard to make the case that warming winters will leave us better off.</p><p>“If you want me to find the psychological upside of anything, I could maybe do it,” Leibowitz confessed. She added, though, that “a lot of people think, ‘I hate winter, I hate the cold, I would be happy if it was warmer all year round.’ But people underestimate how much there is to be lost in losing winter.”</p>

## Pluralistic: I assure you, an AI didn't write a terrible "George Carlin" routine (29 Jan 2024)

date: 2024-01-29, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links I assure you, an AI didn't write a terrible "George Carlin" routine: The Mechanical Turk would like to have a word with all of us. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading I assure you, an AI didn't write a terrible "George Carlin" routine (permalink) On Hallowe'en 1974, Ronald Clark O'Bryan murdered his son with poisoned candy. He needed the insurance money, and he knew that Halloween poisonings were rampant, so he figured he'd get away with it. He was wrong: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Clark_O%27Bryan The stories of Hallowe'en poisonings were just that &#8211; stories. No one was poisoning kids on Hallowe'en &#8211; except this monstrous murderer, who mistook rampant scare stories for truth and assumed (incorrectly) that his murder would blend in with the crowd. Last week, the dudes behind the "comedy" podcast Dudesy released a "George Carlin" comedy special that they claimed had been created, holus bolus, by an AI trained on the comedian's routines. This was a lie. After the Carlin estate sued, the dudes admitted that they had written the (remarkably unfunny) "comedy" special: https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/01/george-carlins-heirs-sue-comedy-podcast-over-ai-generated-impression/ As I've written, we're nowhere near the point where an AI can do your job, but we're well past the point where your boss can be suckered into firing you and replacing you with a bot that fails at doing your job: https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/15/passive-income-brainworms/#four-hour-work-week AI systems can do some remarkable party tricks, but there's a huge difference between producing a plausible sentence and a good one. After the initial rush of astonishment, the stench of botshit becomes unmistakable: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/03/botshit-generative-ai-imminent-threat-democracy Some of this botshit comes from people who are sold a bill of goods: they're convinced that they can make a George Carlin special without any human intervention and when the bot fails, they manufacture their own botshit, assuming they must be bad at prompting the AI. This is an old technology story: I had a friend who was contracted to livestream a Canadian awards show in the earliest days of the web. They booked in multiple ISDN lines from Bell Canada and set up an impressive Mbone encoding station on the wings of the stage. Only one problem: the ISDNs flaked (this was a common problem with ISDNs!). There was no way to livecast the show. Nevertheless, my friend's boss's ordered him to go on pretending to livestream the show. They made a big deal of it, with all kinds of cool visualizers showing the progress of this futuristic marvel, which the cameras frequently lingered on, accompanied by overheated narration from the show's hosts. The weirdest part? The next day, my friend &#8211; and many others &#8211; heard from satisfied viewers who boasted about how amazing it had been to watch this show on their computers, rather than their TVs. Remember: there had been no stream. These people had just assumed that the problem was on their end &#8211; that they had failed to correctly install and configure the multiple browser plugins required. Not wanting to admit their technical incompetence, they instead boasted about how great the show had been. It was the Emperor's New Livestream. Perhaps that's what happened to the Dudesy bros. But there's another possibility: maybe they were captured by their own imaginations. In "Genesis," an essay in the 2007 collection The Creationists, EL Doctorow (no relation) describes how the ancient Babylonians were so poleaxed by the strange wonder of the story they made up about the origin of the universe that they assumed that it must be true. They themselves weren't nearly imaginative enough to have come up with this super-cool tale, so God must have put it in their minds: https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/29/gedankenexperimentwahn/#high-on-your-own-supply That seems to have been what happened to the Air Force colonel who falsely claimed that a "rogue AI-powered drone" had spontaneously evolved the strategy of killing its operator as a way of clearing the obstacle to its main objective, which was killing the enemy: https://pluralistic.net/2023/06/04/ayyyyyy-eyeeeee/ This never happened. It was &#8211; in the chagrined colonel's words &#8211; a "thought experiment." In other words, this guy &#8211; who is the USAF's Chief of AI Test and Operations &#8211; was so excited about his own made up story that he forgot it wasn't true and told a whole conference-room full of people that it had actually happened. Maybe that's what happened with the George Carlinbot 3000: the Dudesy dudes fell in love with their own vision for a fully automated luxury Carlinbot and forgot that they had made it up, so they just cheated, assuming they would eventually be able to make a fully operational Battle Carlinbot. That's basically the Theranos story: a teenaged "entrepreneur" was convinced that she was just about to produce a seemingly impossible, revolutionary diagnostic machine, so she faked its results, abetted by investors, customers and others who wanted to believe: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos The thing about stories of AI miracles is that they are peddled by both AI's boosters and its critics. For boosters, the value of these tall tales is obvious: if normies can be convinced that AI is capable of performing miracles, they'll invest in it. They'll even integrate it into their product offerings and then quietly hire legions of humans to pick up the botshit it leaves behind. These abettors can be relied upon to keep the defects in these products a secret, because they'll assume that they've committed an operator error. After all, everyone knows that AI can do anything, so if it's not performing for them, the problem must exist between the keyboard and the chair. But this would only take AI so far. It's one thing to hear implausible stories of AI's triumph from the people invested in it &#8211; but what about when AI's critics repeat those stories? If your boss thinks an AI can do your job, and AI critics are all running around with their hair on fire, shouting about the coming AI jobpocalypse, then maybe the AI really can do your job? https://locusmag.com/2020/07/cory-doctorow-full-employment/ There's a name for this kind of criticism: "criti-hype," coined by Lee Vinsel, who points to many reasons for its persistence, including the fact that it constitutes an "academic business-model": https://sts-news.medium.com/youre-doing-it-wrong-notes-on-criticism-and-technology-hype-18b08b4307e5 That's four reasons for AI hype: I. to win investors and customers; II. to cover customers' and users' embarrassment when the AI doesn't perform; III. AI dreamers so high on their own supply that they can't tell truth from fantasy; IV. A business-model for doomsayers who form an unholy alliance with AI companies by parroting their silliest hype in warning form. But there's a fifth motivation for criti-hype: to simplify otherwise tedious and complex situations. As Jamie Zawinski writes, this is the motivation behind the obvious lie that the "autonomous cars" on the streets of San Francisco have no driver: https://www.jwz.org/blog/2024/01/driverless-cars-always-have-a-driver/ GM's Cruise division was forced to shutter its SF operations after one of its "self-driving" cars dragged an injured pedestrian for 20 feet: https://www.wired.com/story/cruise-robotaxi-self-driving-permit-revoked-california/ One of the widely discussed revelations in the wake of the incident was that Cruise employed 1.5 skilled technical remote overseers for every one of its "self-driving" cars. In other words, they had replaced a single low-waged cab driver with 1.5 higher-paid remote operators. As Zawinski writes, SFPD is well aware that there's a human being (or more than one human being) responsible for every one of these cars &#8211; someone who is formally at fault when the cars injure people or damage property. Nevertheless, SFPD and SFMTA maintain that these cars can't be cited for moving violations because "no one is driving them." But figuring out who which person is responsible for a moving violation is "complicated and annoying to deal with," so the fiction persists. (Zawinski notes that even when these people are held responsible, they're a "moral crumple zone" for the company that decided to enroll whole cities in nonconsensual murderbot experiments.) Automation hype has always involved hidden humans. The most famous of these was the "mechanical Turk" hoax: a supposed chess-playing robot that was just a puppet operated by a concealed human operator wedged awkwardly into its carapace. This pattern repeats itself through the ages. Thomas Jefferson "replaced his slaves" with dumbwaiters &#8211; but of course, dumbwaiters don't replace slaves, they hide slaves: https://www.stuartmcmillen.com/blog/behind-the-dumbwaiter/ The modern Mechanical Turk &#8211; a division of Amazon that employs low-waged "clickworkers," many of them overseas &#8211; modernizes the dumbwaiter by hiding low-waged workforces behind a veneer of automation. The MTurk is an abstract "cloud" of human intelligence (the tasks MTurks perform are called "HITs," which stands for "Human Intelligence Tasks"). This is such a truism that techies in India joke that "AI" stands for "absent Indians." Or, to use Jathan Sadowski's wonderful term: "Potemkin AI": https://reallifemag.com/potemkin-ai/ This Potemkin AI is everywhere you look. When Tesla unveiled its humanoid robot Optimus, they made a big flashy show of it, promising a $20,000 automaton was just on the horizon. They failed to mention that Optimus was just a person in a robot suit: https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/elon-musk-tesla-robot-optimus-ai Likewise with the famous demo of a "full self-driving" Tesla, which turned out to be a canned fake: https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-video-promoting-self-driving-was-staged-engineer-testifies-2023-01-17/ The most shocking and terrifying and enraging AI demos keep turning out to be "Just A Guy" (in Molly White's excellent parlance): https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF/status/1751670561606971895 And yet, we keep falling for it. It's no wonder, really: criti-hype rewards so many different people in so many different ways that it truly offers something for everyone.

## January 28, 2024

date: 2024-01-29, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

Today&#8212;last night U.S. time&#8212;three military personnel were killed and 34 more wounded in a drone attack on the living quarters at a U.S. base in Jordan, near the Iraq-Syria border. U.S. troops are stationed there to enable them to cross into Syria to help fight the Islamic State. There have been almost-daily drone and missile strikes on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria since the October 7 attack on Israel by Iran-backed Hamas. The U.S. has blamed Iran-backed militant groups for the attack, and while no one has officially claimed responsibility yet, three officials from such groups have said an Iran-backed militia in Iraq is responsible.

## Illinois Election Officials to Consider Striking Trump's Name off Primary Ballot

date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA

CHICAGO — Former President Donald Trump should be removed from Illinois' primary ballot, but the decision should be left to the courts, a retired judge recommended Sunday to the state's election board, arguing that it was clear Trump engaged in insurrection in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.


The Illinois State Board of Elections is expected to consider the recommendation Tuesday. Attorneys for Trump and citizens seeking to keep the Republican former president off the ballot presented their arguments Friday before the hearing officer, Clark Erickson. The retired longtime Kankakee County judge is a Republican.


The Illinois effort to keep Trump off the March ballot is similar to those filed in several other states. The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments next month in a historic Colorado Supreme Court ruling to remove Trump from that state’s ballot. The case presents the high court with its first look at a provision of the 14th Amendment barring some people who “engaged in insurrection” from holding public office.


Erickson’s 21-page recommendation concluded that a “preponderance of the evidence” presented proves that Trump engaged in insurrection.


But he said the election board can't engage in the “significant and sophisticated constitutional analysis” required to remove Trump’s name before the March 19 primary.


“All in all, attempting to resolve a constitutional issue within the expedited schedule of an election board hearing is somewhat akin to scheduling a two-minute round between heavyweight boxers in a telephone booth,” he wrote.

Still, Erickson noted that even if the board disagrees with his reasoning, Trump's name should be removed from the Illinois primary ballot.


The election board is split evenly between four Democrats and four Republicans.


Free Speech for People, which is leading the Illinois ballot effort, praised the recommendation from the Republican retired judge as “significant” but argued that Illinois law allows the board to make the ballot decision.


“We expect that the board and ultimately Illinois courts will uphold Judge Erickson’s thoughtful analysis of why Trump is disqualified from office, but — with the greatest respect — correct him on why Illinois law authorizes that ruling,” Ron Fein, legal director for the group, wrote in a Sunday statement.


Trump's campaign did not immediately return a message left Sunday.

## House Republicans Release Impeachment Articles Against Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas

date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA

Washington — House Republicans on Sunday released two articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas as they vowed to swiftly push forward with election-year efforts to oust him over what they call his failure to manage the U.S.-Mexico border. The rare step against a Cabinet member drew outrage from Democrats and the agency as a politically motivated stunt lacking the constitutional basis to remove Mayorkas from office.


Republicans contend Mayorkas is guilty of “high crimes and misdemeanors” that amount to a “willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law” on immigration and a “breach of the public trust.” Impeachment, they say, is “Congress's only viable option."


“Alejandro N. Mayorkas willfully and systemically refused to comply with the immigration laws, failed to control the border to the detriment of national security, compromised public safety, and violated the rule of law and separation of powers in the Constitution, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States," the impeachment resolution says.


Only once in American history has a Cabinet secretary been impeached: William Belknap, President Ulysses Grant's war secretary, in 1876, over kickbacks in government contracts. Going after an official for a policy dispute, in this instance over the claim that Mayorkas is not upholding immigration laws, is unprecedented.

Ever since taking control of the House in 2023, Republicans have pushed to impeach Mayorkas. Sunday’s announcement comes as their other impeachment drive — to impeach Democratic President Joe Biden in relation to his son Hunter's business dealings — has struggled to advance.


But Republicans have moved with rapid speed against Mayorkas after a series of hearings in recent weeks. It all comes at a time when border security and immigration are key issues in the 2024 campaign and as Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, is promising to launch the “largest deportation operation” in U.S. history if he returns to the White House.


The Republican-controlled House Homeland Security Committee is set to vote Tuesday on the articles of impeachment, aiming to send them to the full House for consideration. Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has said the House will move forward as soon as possible with a vote after that.


Passage requires only a House majority. The Senate would hold a trial, and a two-thirds vote is required for conviction, an exceedingly unlikely outcome in the Democratic-run Senate.


The Republican push also comes at a curious time for Mayorkas.


Even as the House is taking steps to try to remove him from office, Mayorkas has been engaged in arduous negotiations with senators seeking to reach a bipartisan deal on border policy. He has won praise from senators for his engagement in the process.


Democrats have lambasted the impeachment proceedings, calling them a waste of time when lawmakers should be working together to solve the problems. They also say Republicans are part of the problems at the border, with Republicans attacking Mayorkas even as they have failed to give his department the tools it needs to manage the situation.


“They don’t want to fix the problem; they want to campaign on it. That’s why they have undermined efforts to achieve bipartisan solutions and ignored the facts, legal scholars and experts, and even the Constitution itself in their quest to baselessly impeach Secretary Mayorkas,” the department said in a statement Sunday.


Rep. Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the House committee, said the Republican resolution did not have “a shred of evidence of high crimes or misdemeanors — the Constitutional standard for impeachment.” 


The two articles mark the culmination of a roughly yearlong examination by Republicans of the secretary's handling of the border and what they describe as a crisis of the administration's own making. Republicans contend that the administration and Mayorkas specifically either got rid of policies in place under Trump that had controlled migration or enacted policies of their own that encouraged migrants from around the world to come to the U.S. illegally via the southern border. They also accused Mayorkas of lying to Congress, pointing to comments about the border being secure or about vetting of Afghans airlifted to the U.S.


They cite growing numbers of migrants who have at times overwhelmed the capacity of Customs and Border Protection authorities to care for and process them. Arrests for illegal crossings topped 2 million in each of the U.S. government’s past two budget years. In December, arrests for illegal border crossings from Mexico reached an all-time high since figures have been released. The backlog of people in immigration court has grown by 1 million over the past budget year.


In the articles, Republicans argue that Mayorkas is deliberately violating immigration laws passed by Congress, such as those requiring detention of migrants, and that through his policies, a crisis has arisen at the border. They accuse him of releasing migrants without effective ways to make sure they show up for court or are removed from the country. They cited an Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo written by Mayorkas that sets priorities for whom the agency should target for enforcement proceedings as proof that he is letting people stay in the country who don't have the right to do so.


They also attacked the administration’s use of the humanitarian parole authority, which allows the DHS secretary to admit certain migrants into the country. Republicans said the Biden administration has essentially created a mass parole program that bypasses Congress. They cited cities such as New York that have struggled with high numbers of migrants, taxing housing and education systems, as proof of the financial costs immigration is taking.


Democrats, as well as Mayorkas, have argued that it’s not the administration’s policies that are causing people to attempt to migrate to America but that the movement is part of a global mass migration of people fleeing wars, economic instability and political repression.

## Revelers Pack Tampa, Florida, Waterfront for Gasparilla Pirate Fest

date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA

Tampa, Florida — Revelers clad in pirate finery packed Tampa's waterfront this weekend as a flotilla of boats arrived for the city's annual Gasparilla Pirate Fest.


Led by Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla, the invading pirates docked to make a final demand for the key to the city. Once ashore, the festivities celebrating their annual invasion included a Saturday afternoon parade through downtown and live music and bead throwing that lasted well into the night.


A fixture nearly every year since 1904, the Gasparilla Pirate Fest is named for the mythical pirate Jose Gaspar. There's not much evidence he actually existed, but according to legend he plundered ships and captured hostages in the Gulf of Mexico from the 1780s until around 1821.


The colorful account of his supposed life first surfaced in the early 1900s in an advertising brochure for the Gasparilla Inn, which was located south of Tampa in Boca Grande at the end of a rail line and in need of an exciting promotion to lure in guests.


Called the “Last of the Buccaneers,” Gaspar's memory lives on in the name of Tampa Bay’s NFL team.

## pgEdge Redefines Distributed PostgreSQL with the Launch of pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition

date: 2024-01-29, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>First serverless distributed Postgres managed cloud service delivers low latency and high availability in three minutes or less</p>
<p>Alexandria, Virginia – January 24, 2024 — pgEdge, Inc., the leading company dedicated to distributed Postgres, today announced the launch of pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition, making it easy for developers to deploy and access distributed Postgres databases for low latency and high availability. pgEdge Cloud is the first fully distributed database as a service (DBaaS) optimized for the network edge and based completely on the widely adopted open-source PostgreSQL database. pgEdge Cloud Developer is a generous free tier for developers to rapidly and easily experience the advantages of distributed Postgres.</p>
<p>pgEdge Cloud addresses the growing demand for low-latency and “always on” applications that need to be dispersed across multiple cloud regions. As a fully managed distributed Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS), pgEdge Cloud empowers developers and database architects with an intuitive user interface for creation, management and monitoring of distributed database clusters running across multiple cloud regions.</p>
<p>By putting database nodes closer to global users, pgEdge Cloud can dramatically reduce latency and application response times, particularly page loads for database intensive applications. Additionally, having multiple replicated database nodes across the network ensures high levels of availability, since when a node fails or is not reachable traffic automatically routes to the nearest still available node.</p>
<p>pgEdge Cloud is especially well suited for use with edge development platforms such as Cloudflare Workers, Vercel and Fastly. The ability to place database nodes in multiple regions around the global network, together with automated and seamless nearest-node routing, allow developers to deploy very low latency applications that eliminate slow round trips to a single centrally located database. pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition includes built-in integration for Cloudflare Workers, and support for Vercel and Fastly will be available in coming weeks. An example demonstrating pgEdge Cloud’s ease of integration with Cloudflare is https://github.com/pgEdge/cloudflare-worker-template. Additionally, a demo application running against a distributed version of the well-known “Northwind Traders” database, and implemented with Cloudflare Workers and pgEdge Cloud, is at: https://northwind.pgedge.com/.</p>
<p>Key features of pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition include:</p>
<p>Instant Deployment: Developers can now deploy a globally distributed PostgreSQL serverless database in just a minute, streamlining the database setup process and accelerating development.</p>
<p>Predefined multi-region clusters: Creation and deployment of pgEdge distributed databases is simplified via prebuilt global clusters. Developers can select from a set of predefined multi-region clusters that span the continental US, US and Europe, or US, Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Multi-Master (Active-Active) Architecture: Each database node can handle both read and write traffic for low latency and high availability, utilizing an eventually consistent multi-master architecture with built in conflict resolution and reporting.</p>
<p>Latency-based DNS Routing: Geo-proximity routing ensures that users are connected to the nearest pgEdge node that is up and running. </p>
<p>Generous Free Tier: Available for prototyping, application development and evaluation of pgEdge capabilities with up to 12GB of storage across three nodes. </p>
<p>Management and Monitoring: Eliminates the need for manual infrastructure configuration and management while providing automated backups, security against misconfiguration, and continuous monitoring via a clean and easy to use web dashboard.</p>
<p>"pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition marks a significant leap in our mission to make it easy for developers to build and deploy highly distributed database applications across the global network," said Phillip Merrick, Co-founder and CEO at pgEdge. "The innovative features of the pgEdge Cloud fully managed service, from multi-region, multi-master support to its intuitive user interface, empower developers to easily create and manage distributed PostgreSQL databases."</p>
<p>Availability</p>
<p>pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition is available today in preview.  Users requiring more resources or capabilities beyond what is offered in the Developer Edition free tier can upgrade to either pgEdge Cloud Team Edition (coming in H1 2024), or pgEdge Cloud Enterprise Edition.</p>
<p>Experience pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition by signing up at www.pgedge.com/get-started/cloud.  To learn more visit www.pgedge.com or join us for an exclusive webinar “Getting to the Low Latency, High Availability Goodness of Distributed Postgres in 3 Minutes or Less” on Wednesday January 31st at 1pm ET https://hubs.la/Q02gBnsh0.  The first 500 users to sign up for pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition will be eligible for an exclusive launch t-shirt. (Restrictions apply. Offer available in US only.)</p>
<p>About pgEdge:</p>
