## Missouri woman’s murder conviction tossed after 43 years. Her lawyers say a police officer did it

date: 2024-06-15, from: San Jose Mercury News

A judge has overturned the conviction of a Missouri woman who was a psychiatric patient when she incriminated herself in a 1980 killing. Sandra Hemme has spent 43 years behind bars. Her attorneys argue the killing actually was committed by a now-discredited police officer. Judge Ryan Horsman ruled late Friday that Hemme had established evidence of actual innocence. Her attorneys says this is the longest time a women has been been incarcerated for a wrongful conviction. The judge said Hemme must be freed within 30 days unless prosecutors retry her. Prosecutors didn't immediately respond to a phone message from The Associated Press seeking comment.

## Trump Michigan trip includes Black church, far-right activists’ meeting

date: 2024-06-15, from: VOA News USA

DETROIT, MICHIGAN — Donald Trump will use back-to-back stops Saturday to court Black voters and a conservative group that has been accused of attracting white supremacists as the Republican presidential candidate works to stitch together a coalition of historically divergent interests in the battleground state of Michigan.


Trump is scheduled to host an afternoon roundtable at an African American church in downtown Detroit. Later he will appear at the “People's Convention” of Turning Point Action, a group that the Anti-Defamation League says has been linked to a variety of extremists.


Roughly 24 hours before Trump planned to address the conference, well-known white supremacist Nick Fuentes entered Turning Point’s convention hall surrounded by a group of cheering supporters. He was quickly escorted out by security.


Fuentes created political problems for Trump after Fuentes attended a private lunch with the former president and the rapper formerly known as Kanye West at Trump’s Florida estate in 2022.


Trump's weekend plans underscore the evolving political forces shaping the presidential election this fall as he tries to deny Democratic President Joe Biden a second term.


Few states are expected to matter more in November than Michigan, which Biden carried by less than 3 percentage points four years ago. And few voting groups matter more to Democrats than African Americans, who made up the backbone of Biden's political base in 2020. But now, less than five months before Election Day, Black voters are expressing modest signs of disappointment with the Democrat.


Michael Whatley, the new chairman of the Republican National Committee, told Michigan Republicans at a dinner Friday that the state could not be more important.


“Everybody knows if we don’t win Michigan, we’re not going to have a Republican in the White House,” Whatley said. “Let me be more blunt: If we don’t win Michigan, we’re not going to have Donald Trump in the White House.


“We are going to determine the fate of the world in this election in November,” he said.


Trump argues that he can pull in more Black voters due to his economic and border security message, and that his felony indictments make him more relatable.


Democrats are offering a competing perspective.


“Donald Trump is so dangerous for Michigan and dangerous for America and dangerous for Black people,” Michigan Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist II, who is African American, said Friday.


He said it was “offensive” for Trump to address the Turning Point conference, which was taking place at the same convention center that was “the epicenter of their steal the election effort.”


Indeed, dozens of angry Trump loyalists chanting “Stop the count!” descended on the TCF Center, now named Huntington Place, the day after the 2020 presidential election as absentee ballots were being counted. Local media captured scenes of protesters outside and in the lobby. Police prevented them from entering the counting area.


The protests took place after Trump had tweeted that “they are finding Biden votes all over” in several states, including Michigan.


The false notion that Biden benefited from widespread voter fraud has been widely debunked by voting officials in both parties, the court system and members of Trump's former administration. Still, Trump continues to promote such misinformation, which echoed throughout the conservative convention over the weekend.


Speaking from the main stage, Turning Point founder and CEO Charlie Kirk falsely described the conference location as “the scene of a crime.”


Such extreme rhetoric does not appear to have hurt Trump's standing with Black voters, however.


Among Black adults, Biden’s approval has dropped from 94% when he started his term in January 2021 to just 55%, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll published in March.


About 8 in 10 Black voters have an unfavorable opinion of Trump, with roughly two-thirds saying they have a “very unfavorable” view of him, according to an AP-NORC poll conducted in June. About 2 in 10 Black voters have a very or somewhat favorable view of Trump.


Trump won 8% of the Black vote in 2020, according to AP VoteCast. And in what is expected to be a close election, even a modest shift could be consequential.


Maurice Morrison, a 67-year-old lifelong Detroit resident, plans to attend Trump’s church appearance. Morrison acknowledged that Trump, for whom he voted twice before and plans to again, is deeply unpopular in his community and even inside his home.


“Once he decided to run for president as a Republican, that automatically made him racist. That’s his middle name now — ‘Trump is racist’ — everybody I talk to, all the people I know, my family,” said Morrison, who is Black.


Meanwhile, thousands of conservative activists, most of them young and white, were eagerly awaiting Trump’s keynote address Saturday night.

## US diplomat warns China’s provoking of Taiwan risks conflict

date: 2024-06-15, from: VOA News USA

Taipei, Taiwan — Outgoing director of the American Institute in Taiwan, Sandra Oudkirk, has warned China against aggressive moves in the region that could spark a larger conflict.


Oudkirk made the comment in response to a question at a June 14 farewell news conference.


"The United States is profoundly devoted to a status quo in the straits and in the region ... that is one of peace and stability. And that is why we have consistently urged the PRC [People’s Republic of China] to avoid coercive or provocative actions both in the Taiwan Straits and in other areas like the South China Sea and off Japan, because provocative actions are almost by definition dangerous,” she said. “They run the risk of a miscalculation or an accident that could spark a broader conflict."


During Oudkirk's three-year term, China conducted three island-circling military exercises against Taiwan, causing an unprecedented level of tension in the history of the American Institute in Taiwan, or AIT, which serves as Washington’s de facto embassy.


China considers self-governing Taiwan a breakaway province that must one day be reunited with the mainland, by force if necessary.


The U.S., like many countries, does not recognize Taiwan as a country in order to have relations with China. But Washington maintains informal diplomatic relations with Taipei through the AIT, along with direct trade and defense ties, and supports Taiwan as a self-governing democracy.


Oudkirk reiterated U.S. support for Taiwan's defense capabilities against Chinese aggression, saying that bolstering Taiwan’s ability to defend itself was AIT’s “top priority.”


"We look forward to the delivery of the military capabilities” from the long-awaited U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, she said. Worth nearly $20 billion, they were purchased over the past several years but have seen delays in delivery.


Oudkirk blamed the COVID-19 pandemic for affecting supply chains but said the delays were gradually unwinding and to “watch this space.”


The U.S. in early June approved an $80 million sale of F-16 fighter jet spare and repair parts to Taiwan.


China’s defense ministry declared Beijing’s strong opposition to the arms sales on June 7 and urged Washington to withdraw them immediately.


Amid concerns about a potential defense vacuum in Taiwan, some analysts have suggested the U.S. move some arms and ammunition production to Taiwan.


In response, Taiwan's Defense Minister Wellington Koo said on June 11 that the two countries are moving toward "possible joint production," reported Taiwanese media.


Meanwhile, Oudkirk noted that Taiwan is looking at becoming a component supplier for the U.S. defense industry.


"We have had a variety of delegations come through Taiwan looking at cybersecurity, looking at unmanned systems, drones. I can tell there is a lot of interest there but there are still some steps in terms of meeting the standards that the U.S. puts down for its defense industrial base that Taiwan's private companies would have to meet."


Tzu-yun Su, an associate research fellow at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research in Taipei, told VOA the technical issues for Taiwan and U.S. defense companies to expand cooperation are not big, but a major hurdle is corporate governance.


"The confidentiality of the companies, personnel safety control and information network security will be the three major factors,” said Su. “At the same time, the government laws must be connected. If Taiwanese companies can keep up with these regulations and management aspects, they will have a relatively good chance of entering the U.S. defense supply chain."


Asked about concerns that U.S. policy to Taiwan could change if President Joe Biden is not reelected in November, Oudkirk said, “In the United States, unlike on almost any other issue of foreign policy or domestic policy, there is a broad-based, bipartisan consensus on policy towards Taiwan. So, I do not think an election would necessarily change that.”


The American Institute in Taiwan announced in late May that Raymond Greene will succeed Oudkirk as head of the office in Taipei sometime this summer.

## From G7 to fundraiser: Biden balances geopolitics with campaign

date: 2024-06-15, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — After flying through the night across nine time zones, from southern Italy to Southern California, U.S. President Joe Biden is shifting his focus from Russia's challenge of Western unity to raking in big money for his reelection campaign at a Hollywood fundraiser featuring George Clooney and Julia Roberts.


Biden went straight from the Group of Seven summit of wealthy democracies, where Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine took center stage, to Los Angeles and the glitzy gathering unfolding Saturday night at the Peacock Theater. The journey was only broken up by a layover to refuel outside Washington.


Former President Barack Obama is joining headliners Clooney and Roberts, and late-night host Jimmy Kimmel will interview all of them onstage. In a text message to donors beforehand, Roberts called it “a crucial time in the election.” Kimmel wrote in his own text that presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump “will hate this, so let’s do it.”


Luminaries from the entertainment world have increasingly lined up to help Biden's campaign, hoping to provide a fundraising jolt and to energize would-be supporters to turn out ahead of Election Day against Trump.


But appearing with stars this time means Biden is skipping a summit in Switzerland about ways to end Russia’s war in Ukraine. Vice President Kamala Harris is representing the United States.


It's a stark reminder that his responsibilities as president and his reelection effort can sometimes conflict.


“We are going to see an unprecedented and record-setting turnout from the media and entertainment world,” Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Hollywood mogul, major Democratic donor and co-chair of Biden’s campaign, said in a statement.


A Biden fundraiser in March at Radio City Music Hall in New York featured late-night host Stephen Colbert interviewing the president, Obama and former President Bill Clinton. It raised a then-record $26 million, but the California event will bring in at least $28 million, according to the Biden campaign.


Still, Trump has hauled in even bigger numbers.


He outpaced Biden's New York event in April, raking in $50.5 million at a gathering of major donors at the Florida home of billionaire investor John Paulson. The former president’s campaign and the Republican National Committee announced they had raised a whopping $141 million in May, padded by tens of millions of dollars in contributions that flowed in after Trump's guilty verdict in his criminal hush money trial.


That post-conviction bump came after Trump and the Republican Party announced collecting $76 million in April, far exceeding Biden and the Democrats’ $51 million for the month and narrowing a fundraising advantage Biden built earlier in the race.

## Despite gains, Native Americans still face voting barriers

date: 2024-06-15, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Native Americans today say they still face barriers to casting their votes, six decades after U.S. President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act.


Many live miles away from voter registration and polling sites and lack access to reliable transportation.


Others may not have traditional mailing addresses and cannot satisfy voter registration requirements. Voting by mail can be “iffy,” according to O.J. Semans, a Sicangu Lakota citizen living on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota and co-executive director of Four Directions, a voting rights advocacy group that has worked on behalf of tribes in several states.


“You must remember, the old Pony Express [mail delivery on horseback] wasn’t meant for reservations. It was for outposts and settler towns,” Semans said. “The U.S. Postal Service has neglected every Indian reservation in the United States when it comes to ensuring we have equality.”




A 2023 study of mail service on the Navajo Nation — the largest reservation in the U.S. — notes that when deciding where to open post offices during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the U.S. Postal Service picked locations that would “advance military objectives and serve the interests of Anglo-American settlers.”


“Post Offices are fewer and farther from each other on reservation communities; there are fewer service hours; and we show in a mail experiment that letters posted on reservations are slower and less likely to arrive," the study said.


Post offices exist on Seman’s Rosebud Reservation, but they no longer accept general delivery.


“So, if you want to vote by mail, you can request an absentee ballot and fill it out. But you’d never get the ballot back,” he said.


States pass restrictive laws


The 1965 Voting Rights Act banned traditional forms of voter discrimination such as literacy tests, character assessments and other practices widely used to disenfranchise minority voters.


It authorized the federal government to oversee voter registration and election procedures in certain states and localities with histories of discriminatory practices, and it also required those jurisdictions to obtain “preclearance” from the Justice Department or a federal court before changing voting laws or procedures.


In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the formula for deciding which localities needed preclearance as unconstitutional, opening the way for states to pass new voting laws.


During a Senate Indian Affairs Committee hearing in 2021, Jacqueline De Leon, an enrolled member of the Isleta Pueblo and a staff attorney at the Native American Rights Fund, or NARF, described some conditions for Indigenous voters.


“In South Dakota, Native American voters were forced to vote in a repurposed chicken coop with no bathroom facilities and feathers on the floor,” she testified.


In Wisconsin, Native Americans were required to cast their ballots inside a sheriff’s office.


NARF, tribes fight back


In 2021, President Joe Biden created the Interagency Steering Group on Native American Voting Rights to report on barriers facing Native voters.


“Native American communities have not been immune, but indeed have been packed or divided by district lines that dilute their vote or otherwise discriminate,” the group reported.




In November 2021, North Dakota’s Republican-led legislature approved a new legislative map that separated state House districts on the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation and the Fort Berthold reservation, home to the Three Affiliated Tribes.


The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and Spirit Lake tribes filed a federal lawsuit arguing that the new map violated the Voting Rights Act by packing the Turtle Mountain band — that is, concentrating them into a single electoral district to reduce their influence in other districts, and cracking — or dividing — the Spirit Lake tribe across districts to dilute their voting power.


“A conservative judge found this was a clear violation of the Voting Rights Act,” De Leon told VOA. “And rather than protect its Native constituents where there was a violation, the state has appealed, trying to just block the cost of action as opposed to remediating the discrimination.”




Arizona passed a law in 2022 requiring voters to provide proof of their physical address.


“And that was really an attack on the Native vote because about 40,000 homes in Indian Country in Arizona don't have traditional addresses on them or any way to prove residential location,” De Leon said.


With NARF’s support, the Tohono O’odham Nation and the Gila River Indian Community in 2022 filed suit in U.S. District Court for Arizona. In 2023, the court ruled in their favor, finding that the address requirements violated tribe members’ constitutional right to vote.


With five months to go before November’s general election, Semans said, Indigenous voting rights activists must stay vigilant.


“With this new Supreme Court, even rulings that we got years ago that were positive for Indian country could change before then,” he said. “Things can change on a dime.”

## Worst of rainfall that triggered Florida floods is over

date: 2024-06-15, from: VOA News USA

FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida — Although more rain could trigger additional isolated Florida flooding, forecasters say the strong, persistent storms that dumped up to 50 centimeters (20 inches) in southern parts of the state appear to have passed.


Some neighborhood streets in the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas still have standing water, although it is rapidly receding, officials said.


“The worst flooding risk was the last three days,” said Sammy Hadi, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Miami. “The heaviest rainfall has concluded.”


The no-name storm system pushed across Florida from the Gulf of Mexico at roughly the same time as the early June start of hurricane season, which this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory amid concerns that climate change is increasing storm intensity.


Florida Governor Ron DeSantis held a media briefing in Hollywood, south of Fort Lauderdale, and said while more rain was coming, it’s likely to be more typical of South Florida afternoon showers this time of year.


“We are going to get some more rain today, maybe throughout the balance of the weekend. Hopefully it’s not approaching the levels that it was, but we have a lot of resources staged here, and we’ll be able to offer the state’s assistance,” he said.


DeSantis said the state has deployed about 100 pumps in addition to what cities and counties are using to try to clear water from streets.


Florida Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said while flooding was extensive, there were no reports of destroyed homes and very few of severely damaged homes. No deaths or serious injuries have been reported.


“We don’t think there’s going to be enough damage to necessarily qualify for a federal disaster declaration,” DeSantis said. But he added the storms may have affected enough business to qualify for Small Business Administration assistance.


The downpours hit Tuesday and continued into Wednesday, delaying flights at two of the state’s largest airports and leaving vehicles waterlogged and stalled in some of the region’s lowest-lying streets. The main problem was hundreds of vehicles that were stranded on streets as people were unable to navigate the flood waters.


“Looked like the beginning of a zombie movie,” said Ted Rico, a tow truck driver who spent much of Wednesday night and Thursday morning helping to clear the streets of stalled vehicles. “There’s cars littered everywhere, on top of sidewalks, in the median, in the middle of the street, no lights on. Just craziness, you know. Abandoned cars everywhere.”

## US city repeals ban on psychic readings as industry gains more acceptance

date: 2024-06-15, from: VOA News USA

NORFOLK, Virginia — Ashley Branton has earned a living as a psychic medium for seven years, helping a growing number of people with heavy choices about toxic relationships, home purchases and cross-country moves.


And while the tarot cards are never wrong, she said, they didn't see this one coming.


The City Council in Norfolk, Virginia, repealed a 45-year-old ban this week on "the practice of palmistry, palm reading, phrenology or clairvoyance, for monetary or other compensation."


Soothsaying, it turned out, had been a first-degree misdemeanor and carried up to a year in jail.


"I had no idea that was even a thing," Branton said with a laugh Thursday among the crystals in her Norfolk shop, Velvet Witch, where she also performs tarot readings and psychic healings. "I'm glad it's never come down on me."


It's unclear exactly why this city of 230,000 people on the Chesapeake Bay, home to the nation's largest Navy base, nullified the 1979 ordinance. Versions of the ban had existed for decades before.


Norfolk spokesperson Kelly Straub said in an email that it was repealed "because it is no longer used." City Council members said little during their vote Tuesday, although one joked that "somebody out there predicted that this was going to pass."


Jokes aside, the city's repeal comes as the psychic services industry is growing in the U.S., generating an estimated $2.3 billion in revenue last year and employing 97,000 people, according to a 2023 report from market research firm IBIS World.


In late 2017, a Pew Research Center survey found that most American adults identify as Christians. But many also hold New Age beliefs, with 4 in 10 believing in the power of psychics. A 2009 survey for the Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project found about 1 in 7 Americans had consulted a psychic.


Branton, 42, who previously worked as a makeup artist, said the market is expanding for psychic mediums because social media has fueled awareness. An aversion to organized religion also plays a role, along with the nation's divisive politics and a growing sense of uncertainty, particularly among millennials and younger generations.


"Ever since COVID, people have been carrying this weight. They're just carrying so much," Branton said.




"And people are starting to do inner work," she continued. "They're starting to take care of their mental health. And they're starting to take care of the spiritual aspect."


Branton said she considers her work a calling. Psychic gifts run in her family, and she's had them her whole life.


"I always had interactions with spirits," she said. "I've always been an empath. I can feel people's energies."


Branton said she's built up her clientele through word of mouth, without any advertising.


"I'm very proud of that," she said. "There's going to be scammers and people out here doing this for just the money. Obviously, this is my way of living now. But it was never about money for me."


In 2022, AARP warned of scam psychics who prey on "people who are grieving, lonely or struggling emotionally, physically or financially."


And some bans remain in place. In October, the police chief in Hanover, Pennsylvania, told a witchcraft-themed store that any complaints about tarot card readings would prompt an investigation, The New York Times reported.


The police chief cited an old state law that makes it illegal to predict the future for money. In 2007, the city of Philadelphia cited the same law when it shut down more than a dozen psychics, astrologers and tarot-card readers, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported.


Fortune telling bans stemmed from anti-witchcraft and anti-vagrancy laws in 18th century England, said Charles McCrary, a professor of religious studies at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Florida.


The American laws took hold in the mid-19th century, an era of growing concern about fraudulent business practices, McCrary said. But the Spiritualism movement, which often involved channeling the dead, was also growing in popularity, particularly among the middle and upper classes.


"There was something about these white, Spiritualist women that I think troubled a lot of people," McCrary said.


"Part of what made it threatening was it couldn't be written off as something that poor people do or something for the marginal," he added. "It was very popular. And so more mainstream Christians found it especially threatening. And a lot of people were Christians who also did seances."


Such laws faced little scrutiny from the courts at first, said David L. Hudson, a law professor at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, and a fellow with the Freedom Forum think tank in Washington.


The Ohio Supreme Court upheld a state law in 1928 that regulated fortune telling, writing that "liberty of speech is not license to speak anything that one pleases freed from all criminal or civil responsibility." Other courts reasoned that fortune telling was commercial speech, which received no First Amendment protection until the mid-1970s.


More recently, courts have increasingly viewed bans on fortune tellers with skepticism on First Amendment grounds. Maryland's Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that fortune telling for a fee is protected free speech.


"We've come a long way, both in terms of social norms and social acceptance," Hudson told The Associated Press, likening psychic readings to tattoos. "But also there's been a massive development of First Amendment law ... It's very disfavored to entirely ban a medium of expression."


Even though Norfolk's ban was practically forgotten and no longer enforced, Carol Peterson is relieved about the repeal. She owns the Crystal Sunflower, a store in Norfolk that offers tarot card readings and vibrational sound therapy. She is also a civilian geologist for the military.


"I was like, 'Oh my God, I could get a class one misdemeanor,'" Peterson said.


"People have this misconceived notion that tarot is evil or demonic," Peterson added. "But you're helping people tap into their highest self for their journey. And if people would be more curious instead of judgmental, I think that they would be pleasantly surprised."

## Reported birth of rare white buffalo calf fulfills Lakota prophecy

date: 2024-06-15, from: VOA News USA

HELENA, Montana — The reported birth of a rare white buffalo in Yellowstone National Park fulfills a Lakota prophecy that portends better times, according to members of the American Indian tribe who cautioned that it's also a signal that more must be done to protect the earth and its animals.


"The birth of this calf is both a blessing and warning. We must do more," said Chief Arvol Looking Horse, the spiritual leader of the Lakota, Dakota and the Nakota Oyate in South Dakota, and the 19th keeper of the sacred White Buffalo Calf Woman Pipe and Bundle.


The birth of the sacred calf comes as after a severe winter in 2023 drove thousands of Yellowstone buffalo, also known as bison, to lower elevations. More than 1,500 were killed, sent to slaughter or transferred to tribes seeking to reclaim stewardship over an animal their ancestors lived alongside for millennia.


Erin Braaten of Kalispell took several photos of the calf shortly after it was born on June 4 in the Lamar Valley in the northeastern corner of the park.


Her family was visiting the park when she spotted "something really white" among a herd of bison across the Lamar River.


Traffic ended up stopping while bison crossed the road, so Braaten stuck her camera out the window to take a closer look with her telephoto lens.


"I look and it's this white bison calf. And I was just totally, totally floored," she said.


After the bison cleared the roadway, the Braatens turned their vehicle around and found a spot to park. They watched the calf and its mother for 30-45 minutes.




"And then she kind of led it through the willows there," Braaten said. Although Braaten came back each of the next two days, she didn't see the white calf again.


For the Lakota, the birth of a white buffalo calf with a black nose, eyes and hooves is akin to the second coming of Jesus Christ, Looking Horse said.


Lakota legend says about 2,000 years ago — when nothing was good, food was running out and bison were disappearing — White Buffalo Calf Woman appeared, presented a bowl pipe and a bundle to a tribal member, taught them how to pray and said that the pipe could be used to bring buffalo to the area for food. As she left, she turned into a white buffalo calf.


"And some day when the times are hard again," Looking Horse said in relating the legend, "I shall return and stand upon the earth as a white buffalo calf, black nose, black eyes, black hooves."


A similar white buffalo calf was born in Wisconsin in 1994 and was named Miracle, he said.


Troy Heinert, the executive director of the South Dakota-based InterTribal Buffalo Council, said the calf in Braaten's photos looks like a true white buffalo because it has a black nose, black hooves and dark eyes.


"From the pictures I've seen, that calf seems to have those traits," said Heinert, who is Lakota. An albino buffalo would have pink eyes.


A naming ceremony has been held for the Yellowstone calf, Looking Horse said, though he declined to reveal the name. A ceremony celebrating the calf's birth is set for June 26 at the Buffalo Field Campaign headquarters in West Yellowstone.


Other tribes also revere white buffalo.


"Many tribes have their own story of why the white buffalo is so important," Heinert said. "All stories go back to them being very sacred."


Heinert and several members of the Buffalo Field Campaign say they've never heard of a white buffalo being born in Yellowstone, which has wild herds. Park officials had not seen the buffalo yet and could not confirm its birth in the park, and they have no record of a white buffalo being born in the park previously.


Jim Matheson, executive director of the National Bison Association, could not quantify how rare the calf is.


"To my knowledge, no one's ever tracked the occurrence of white buffalo being born throughout history. So I'm not sure how we can make a determination how often it occurs."


Besides herds of the animals on public lands or overseen by conservation groups, about 80 tribes across the U.S. have more than 20,000 bison, a figure that's been growing in recent years.


In Yellowstone and the surrounding area, the killing or removal of large numbers of bison happens almost every winter, under an agreement between federal and Montana agencies that has limited the size of the park's herds to about 5,000 animals. Yellowstone officials last week proposed a slightly larger population of up to 6,000 bison, with a final decision expected next month.


But ranchers in Montana have long opposed increasing the Yellowstone herds or transferring the animals to tribes. Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte has said he would not support any management plan with a population target greater than 3,000 Yellowstone bison.


Heinert sees the calf's birth as a reminder "that we need to live in a good way and treat others with respect."


"I hope that calf is safe and going to live its best life in Yellowstone National Park, exactly where it was designed to be," Heinert said.

## Some Mexican shelters see crowding as Biden's asylum ban takes hold

date: 2024-06-15, from: VOA News USA

MATAMOROS, Mexico  — Some shelters south of the U.S. border are caring for many more migrants now that the Biden administration stopped considering most asylum requests, while others have yet to see much of a change.


The impact appears uneven more than a week after the temporary suspension took effect. Shelters south of Texas and California have plenty of space, while as many as 500 deportations from Arizona each day are straining shelters in Mexico's Sonora state, their directors say.


"We're having to turn people away because we can't, we don't have the room for all the people who need shelter," said Joanna Williams, executive director of Kino Border Initiative, which can take in 100 people at a time.


About 120 are in San Juan Bosco shelter in Nogales, across the border from the Arizona city with the same name, up from about 40 before the policy change, according to its director, Juan Francisco Loureiro.


"We have had a quite remarkable increase," Loureiro said Thursday. Most are Mexican, including families as well as adults. Mexico also agreed to accept deportees from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.


A shelter in Agua Prieta, a remote town bordering Douglas, Arizona, also began receiving more Mexican men, women and children last weekend — 40 on Sunday, more than 50 on Monday and then about 30 a day. Like those sent to Nogales, most had entered the U.S. farther west, along the Arizona-California state line, according to Perla del Angel, a worker at the Exodus Migrant Attention Center.


Mexicans make up a relatively large percentage of border arrests in much of Arizona compared to other regions, which may help explain why Nogales is affected. Mexicans are generally the easiest nationality to deport because officials only have to drive them to a border crossing instead of arranging a flight.


In Tijuana, directors of four large shelters said this week that they haven't received a single migrant deported since the asylum ban took effect. Al Otro Lado, a migrant advocacy group, consulted only seven migrants on the first full day operating an information booth at the main crossing where migrants are deported from San Diego.


"What there is right now is a lot of uncertainty," said Paulina Olvera, president of Espacio Migrante, who houses up to 40 people traveling in families, predominantly from Mexico, and has others sleeping on the sidewalk outside. "So far what we've seen is the rumors and the mental health impact on people. We haven't seen returns yet."


Biden administration officials said last week that thousands have been deported since the new rule took effect on July 5, suspending asylum whenever arrests for illegal crossings hit a trigger of 2,500 in a single day. The officials, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, were not more specific. The halt will remain in effect until arrests fall below a seven-day daily average of 1,500.


"We are ready to repatriate a record number of people in the coming days," Blas Nuñez-Neto, assistant homeland security secretary for border and immigration policy, told Spanish-language reporters after the policy was announced.


The Homeland Security Department did not immediately respond to a request for figures on Friday and neither did the National Immigration Institute in Mexico.

## Speaker: House will sue for Biden’s Justice Department interview audio

date: 2024-06-15, from: VOA News USA

washington — Speaker Mike Johnson said Friday that the House of Representatives would go to court to enforce the subpoena against Attorney General Merrick Garland for access to President Joe Biden's special counsel audio interview, hours after the Justice Department refused to prosecute Republicans' contempt-of-Congress charge. 


"It is sadly predictable that the Biden administration's Justice Department will not prosecute Garland for defying congressional subpoenas even though the department aggressively prosecuted Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro for the same thing," Johnson said in a statement.   


In a letter to Johnson earlier Friday, a Justice Department official cited the agency's "long-standing position and uniform practice" to not prosecute officials who don't comply with subpoenas because of a president's claim of executive privilege. 


The Democratic president last month asserted executive privilege to block the release of the audio, which the White House says Republicans want only for political purposes. Republicans moved forward with the contempt effort anyway, voting Wednesday to punish Garland for refusing to provide the recording. 


Assistant Attorney General Carlos Felipe Uriarte noted that the Justice Department under presidents of both political parties has declined to prosecute in similar circumstances when there has been a claim of executive privilege. 


Accordingly, the department "will not bring the congressional contempt citation before a grand jury or take any other action to prosecute the attorney general," Uriarte said in the letter to Johnson. The letter did not specify who in the Justice Department made the decision. 


Republicans were incensed when special counsel Robert Hur declined to prosecute Biden over his handling of classified documents and quickly opened an investigation. GOP lawmakers — led by Representatives Jim Jordan and James Comer — sent a subpoena for audio of Hur's interviews with Biden, but the Justice Department turned over only some of the records, leaving out audio of the interview with the president. 


Republicans have accused the White House of suppressing the tape because they say the president is afraid to have voters hear it during an election year. 


A transcript of the Hur interview showed Biden struggling to recall some dates and occasionally confusing some details — something longtime aides say he's done for years in both public and private — but otherwise showing deep recall in other areas. Biden and his aides are particularly sensitive to questions about his age. At 81, he's the oldest-ever president, and he is currently seeking another four-year term. 


The attorney general has said the Justice Department has gone to extraordinary lengths to provide information to the lawmakers about Hur's investigation. However, Garland has said releasing the audio could jeopardize future sensitive investigations because witnesses might be less likely to cooperate if they know their interviews might become public. 


In a letter last month detailing Biden's decision to assert executive privilege, White House counsel Ed Siskel accused Republicans of seeking the recordings so they can "chop them up" and distort them to attack the president. Executive privilege gives presidents the right to keep information from the courts, Congress and the public to protect the confidentiality of decision-making, though it can be challenged in court. 


The Justice Department noted that it also declined to prosecute Attorney General Bill Barr, who was held in contempt in 2019. The Democratically controlled House voted to issue a referral against Barr after he refused to turn over documents related to a special counsel investigation into former President Donald Trump. 


The Justice Department similarly declined to prosecute former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows after he was held in contempt of Congress for ceasing to cooperate with the January 6 committee investigating the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Years before that, then-Attorney General Eric Holder was held in contempt related to the gun-running operation known as Operation Fast and Furious. The Justice Department also took no action against Holder. 


Navarro and Bannon, two former Trump White House officials, were prosecuted for contempt of Congress for defying subpoenas from the January 6 committee. They were both found guilty at trial and sentenced to four months in prison.

## Conspiracy theorist Jones' personal assets being sold for $1.5B Sandy Hook debt

date: 2024-06-14, from: VOA News USA

houston — A federal judge Friday ordered the liquidation of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' personal assets but dismissed his company's separate bankruptcy case, leaving the future of his Infowars media platform uncertain as he owes $1.5 billion for his false claims that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax.


Judge Christopher Lopez approved converting Jones' proposed personal bankruptcy reorganization to a liquidation, but threw out the attempted reorganization of his company, Austin, Texas-based Free Speech Systems. Many of the Sandy Hook families had asked that the company also be liquidated.


If Free Speech Systems' bankruptcy reorganization had been converted to a liquidation, Jones could have lost ownership of the company, its social media accounts, the Infowars studio in Austin, and all copyrights as the company's possessions were sold. Jones smiled as the judge dismissed the company's case.


It wasn't immediately clear what will happen to Free Speech Systems, Infowars' parent company that Jones built into a multimillion-dollar moneymaker over the past 25 years.


One scenario could be that the company and Infowars are allowed to keep operating while efforts to collect on the $1.5 billion debt are made in state courts in Texas and Connecticut, where the families won lawsuits against Jones, according to lawyers involved with the case.


Another scenario is that lawyers for the Sandy Hook families go back to the bankruptcy court and ask Lopez to liquidate the company as part of Jones' personal case, because Jones owns the business, lawyers said.


Lopez said his sole focus in determining whether to dismiss Free Speech Systems' case or order a liquidation was what would be best for the company and its creditors, including the Sandy Hook families. Lopez also said Free Speech Systems' case appeared to be one of the longest running of its kind in the country, and it was approaching a deadline to resolve it.


"This case is one of the more difficult cases I've had," said Lopez. "When you look at it, I think creditors are better served in pursuing their state court rights."


Many of Jones' personal assets will be sold off, but his primary home in the Austin area and some other belongings are exempt from bankruptcy liquidation. He already has moved to sell his Texas ranch worth about $2.8 million, a gun collection and other assets to pay debts.


In the lead-up to Friday's hearing, Jones had been telling his web viewers and radio listeners that Free Speech Systems was on the verge of being shut down because of the bankruptcy. He urged them to download videos from his online archive to preserve them and pointed them to a new website of his father's company if they want to continue buying the dietary supplements he sells on his show.


"This is probably the end of Infowars here very, very soon. If not today, in the next few weeks or months," Jones told reporters before Friday's hearing. "But it's just the beginning of my fight against tyranny."


Jones has about $9 million in personal assets, according to the most recent financial filings in court. Free Speech Systems, which employs 44 people, has about $6 million in cash on hand and about $1.2 million worth of inventory, according to J. Patrick Magill, the chief restructuring officer appointed by the court to run the company during the bankruptcy.


Jones and Free Speech Systems filed for bankruptcy protection in 2022, when relatives of many victims of the 2012 school shooting that killed 20 first-graders and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut, won lawsuit judgments of more than $1.4 billion in Connecticut and $49 million in Texas.


The relatives said they were traumatized by Jones' comments and his followers' actions. They have testified about being harassed and threatened by Jones' believers, some of whom confronted the grieving families in person saying the shooting never happened and their children never existed. One parent said someone threatened to dig up his dead son's grave.

## McCaul raises concerns over USAGM ability to vet staff

date: 2024-06-14, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The chairperson of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday outlined what he described as failures by the U.S. Agency for Global Media to adequately investigate allegations and whistleblower complaints.


A 73-page report described a three-year investigation into whistleblower complaints about an employee at the USAGM network Voice of America, or VOA, including allegations of falsifying credentials and the mishandling of a contract.


Chairman Michael McCaul, a Republican representative from Texas, said, “Given the important work of USAGM and VOA to provide accurate news around the world, I am extremely concerned about the agency’s serious investigative blunders despite the alarming complaints.”


McCaul described the case as “the tip of the iceberg” in a statement, and staff representing Republicans on the committee said on background that it feeds into previous concerns about whether the agency properly vets foreign-born staff. However, the report focuses on the investigation into one employee.


The report found “credible evidence” of wrongdoing, including that the employee in question did not hold a doctorate or equivalent from a French university as stated on a resume; mishandled a major contract; awarded “excessive” overtime pay to favored employees; and “faced persistent complaints” about an “abrasive leadership style.”


Because the incident involves a personnel issue at VOA, which does not typically comment on such matters, the network is not naming the employee.


The report further notes that an investigation under former President Donald Trump’s appointed leadership at VOA had found grounds to dismiss the senior staff member in 2021 after an investigation that included the handling of a $950,000 contract.


After a change in administration, the McCaul report notes, the termination was reversed, and the employee was moved to a new department.


An independent investigation by the Office of Special Counsel, or OSC, released in May 2023, described the case as a “particularly complex matter” and said it was “beyond the scope of this review to evaluate the merits of several allegations made against the individual; however, CEO Office involvement will be examined.”


The OSC added that the USAGM Labor and Employee Relations investigators tasked with looking into the allegations “faced intense pressure” to conclude in 2021 that the employee should be terminated.




The report by McCaul includes testimony and interviews with senior USAGM and VOA officials and staff. It states that once the agency was provided evidence to support the claims of falsified credentials, USAGM moved to issue a reprimand to the employee.


Staff representing Republicans on the committee, speaking to VOA on background, said that during the committee investigation, they found USAGM had failed to thoroughly investigate the whistleblower complaints and other issues regarding oversight and negligence.


The staff said the report’s findings and USAGM’s apparent failure to take appropriate action reflect wider and far-reaching concerns about the agency, including whether political bias played a role.


A statement emailed to VOA and attributed to USAGM CEO Amanda Bennett said her office “cannot comment on specific personnel matters.”


But, Bennett said, “We unequivocally reject the Committee's allegations that the agency’s investigation of an employee’s background was politicized, corrupt or mismanaged in any way.”


Noting that the agency stands by its final decision in investigating complaints, the statement said its staff “made tremendous efforts to locate evidence relevant to the matter in question, and aggressively pursued every possible avenue to conduct a thorough investigation.”


Mark Zaid, an attorney who represents the employee in question, told VOA via email, “The Committee's one-sided report continues an unexplained vendetta that has spanned two Administrations” against his client.


He charged the report included “many incomplete, misinterpreted and defamatory conclusions.”


But, Zaid said, he “agrees with the Committee on two things.”


“First, there is a great deal of confusion surrounding the equivalency of French and American Ph.D.s, including among various experts,” he said. “Second, USAGM has mishandled this investigation from the beginning, particularly by interfering with [the client’s] right to counsel and denying [the client’s] appropriate due process.”


He noted that “contrary to a footnote in the report,” USAGM did not share details with Zaid, in his capacity as the employee's attorney, or keep him updated about what the agency was doing in regard to the McCaul investigation.


Members of McCaul’s staff told VOA on background that the committee intends no ill will toward the employee but that as a congressional oversight board it is their duty to investigate whistleblower complaints and follow the facts.


The main focus of the report is on whether the employee held an advanced degree, as stated on the person's resume and on the VOA website. McCaul’s report says it was able to quickly establish three years ago that the credentials were incorrect.


Zaid told VOA that attorneys have “repeatedly provided documentation” to confirm the degree, and enough evidence exists to show the qualification “has been properly described.”


Gregory Meeks, the leading Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, issued a statement that called McCaul’s report “one-sided.” Meeks said, however, that USAGM should “address the Committee’s oversight questions and concerns."


The findings in McCaul’s report serve as a case study of a wider problem, according to the committee staff, who spoke on background.


The report calls for the employee to be terminated as per the earlier Labor and Employee Relations investigation and for USAGM to rectify its vetting process.


“USAGM’s actions raise questions about the agency’s ability to vet its own staff, and I am extremely concerned Democrats who criticized the agency under the last administration have gone silent instead of working in good faith to serve Americans who deserve transparency and accountability,” McCaul said in a statement.


It requests the agency deliver a report to Congress on vetting procedures within 90 days.

## Can you blow a PC speaker with a Linux kernel module?

date: 2024-06-14, from: OS News

Sometimes you come across a story that&#8217;s equally weird and delightful, and this is definitely one of them. Oleksandr Natalenko posted a link on Mastodon to a curious email sent to the Linux Kernel Mailing List, which apparently gets sent to the LKML every single year. The message is very straightforward. Is it possible to write a kernel module which, when loaded, will blow the PC speaker? ↫ R.F. Burns on the LKML Since this gets sent every year, it&#8217;s most likely some automated thing that&#8217;s more of a joke than a real request at this point. However, originally, there was a real historical reason behind the inquiry, as Schlemihl Schalmeier on Mastodon points out. They link to the original rationale behind the request, posted to the LKML after the request was first made, all the way back in 2007. At the time, the author was helping a small school system manage a number of Linux workstations, and the students there were abusing the sound cards on those workstations for shenanigans. They addressed this by only allowing users with root privileges access to the sound devices. However, kids are smart, and they started abusing the PC speaker instead, and even unloading the PC speaker kernel module didn&#8217;t help because the kids found ways to abuse the PC speaker outside of the operating system (the BIOS maybe? I have no idea). And so, the author notes, the school system wanted them to remove the PC speakers entirely, but this would be a very fiddly and time-consuming effort, since there were a lot of PCs, and of course, this would all have to be done on-site &#8211; unlike the earlier solutions which could all be done remotely. So, the idea was raised about seeing if there was a way to blow the PC speaker by loading a kernel module.  If so, a mass-deployment of a kernel module overnight would take care of the PC speaker problem once and for all. ↫ R.F. Burns on the LKML So, that&#8217;s the original story behind the request. It&#8217;s honestly kind of ingenious, and it made me wonder if the author got a useful reply on the LKML, and if such a kernel module was ever created. The original thread didn&#8217;t seem particularly conclusive to me, and the later yearly instances of the request don&#8217;t seem to yield much either. It seems unlikely to me this is possible at all. Regardless, this is a very weird bit of Linux kernel lore, and I&#8217;d love to know if there&#8217;s more going on. Various parts of the original rationale seem dubious to me, such as the handwavy thing about abusing the PC speaker outside of the operating system, and what does &#8220;abusing&#8221; the PC speaker even mean in the first place? As Natalenko notes, it seems there&#8217;s more to this story, and I&#8217;d love to find out what it is.

## Apple set to be first big tech group to face charges under EU digital law

date: 2024-06-14, from: OS News

Brussels is set to charge Apple over allegedly stifling competition on its mobile app store, the first time EU regulators have used new digital rules to target a Big Tech group. The European Commission has determined that the iPhone maker is not complying with obligations to allow app developers to “steer” users to offers outside its App Store without imposing fees on them, according to three people with close knowledge of its investigation. ↫ Javier Espinoza and Michael Acton This was always going to happen for as long as Apple&#8217;s malicious compliance kept dragging on. The rules in the Digital Markets Act are quite clear and simple, and despite the kind of close cooperation with EU lawmakers no normal EU citizen is ever going to get, Apple has been breaking this law from day one without any intent to comply. European Union regulators have given Apple far, far more leeway and assistance than any regular citizen of small business would get, and that has to stop. The possible fines under the DMA are massive. If Apple is found guilty, they could be fined for up to 10% of its global revenue, or 20% for repeated violations. This is no laughing matters, and this is not one of those cases where a company like Apple could calculate fines as a mere cost of doing business &#8211; this would have a material impact on the company&#8217;s numbers, and shareholders are definitely not going to like it if Apple gets fined such percentages. As these are preliminary findings, Apple could still implement changes, but if past behaviour is any indication, any possibly changes will just be ever more malicious compliance.

## Driving forward in Android drivers

date: 2024-06-14, from: OS News

Google&#8217;s own Project Zero security research effort, which often finds and publishes vulnerabilities in both other companies&#8217; and its own products, set its sights on Android once more, this time focusing on third-party kernel drivers. Android&#8217;s open-source ecosystem has led to an incredible diversity of manufacturers and vendors developing software that runs on a broad variety of hardware. This hardware requires supporting drivers, meaning that many different codebases carry the potential to compromise a significant segment of Android phones. There are recent public examples of third-party drivers containing serious vulnerabilities that are exploited on Android. While there exists a well-established body of public (and In-the-Wild) security research on Android GPU drivers, other chipset components may not be as frequently audited so this research sought to explore those drivers in greater detail. ↫ Seth Jenkins They found a whole host of security issues in these third-party kernel drivers in phones both from Google itself as well as from other companies. An interesting point the authors make is that because it&#8217;s getting ever harder to find 0-days in core Android, people with nefarious intent are looking at other parts of an Android system now, and these kernel drivers are an inviting avenue for them. They seem to focus mostly on GPU drivers, for now, but it stands to reason they&#8217;ll be targeting other drivers, too. As usual with Android, the discovered exploits were often fixed, but the patches took way, way too long to find their way to end users due to the OEMs lagging behind when it comes to sending those patches to users. The authors propose wider adoption of Android APEX to make it easier to OEMs to deliver kernel patches to users faster. I always like the Project Zero studies and articles, because they really take no prisoners, and whether they&#8217;re investigating someone else like Microsoft or Apple, or their own company Google, they go in hard, do not surgarcoat their findings, and apply the same standards to everyone.

## Court denies US request to sell yacht it says belongs to sanctioned Russian oligarch

date: 2024-06-14, from: VOA News USA

washington — A New York court has denied the U.S. government the right to sell a superyacht that it alleges belongs to sanctioned Russian oligarch Suleyman Kerimov.


The ruling means that U.S. taxpayers will continue to foot the bill for roughly $740,000 a month for the 106-meter Amadea's upkeep and insurance.


The luxury vessel, with an estimated value of $230 million, is at the center of a legal battle over the enforcement of U.S. sanctions against Russia. American prosecutors allege that Kerimov and his proxies routed dollar transactions through U.S. financial institutions to maintain the yacht, which would constitute a sanctions violation.


In May 2022, the island nation of Fiji confiscated the Amadea and later transferred it to the United States. The U.S. government would like to sell the yacht and transfer the proceeds to Ukraine.


But that procedure, known as civil forfeiture, grew more complicated when another Russian billionaire, Eduard Khudainatov, who is not under U.S. sanctions, claimed the Amadea actually belongs to him.


In court filings, the Justice Department has termed Khudainatov a "straw owner" for Kerimov. Khudainatov denies that.


The legal battle over Amadea could take a while. Until it concludes, the U.S. government is paying roughly $600,000 for the yacht's upkeep and $140,000 for its insurance each month.


In a bid to decrease those expenses, the U.S. government requested permission to sell the vessel and convert its value into cash. That practice is relatively common in civil forfeiture cases when an asset is rapidly depreciating in value or its upkeep is excessively costly.


But on Tuesday, the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York ruled that the cost of maintaining Amadea was not "excessive."


To assess "whether the maintenance costs of the Amadea are excessive, the court must not look solely at the total dollar amount of the maintenance costs, but must principally consider whether those amounts are more than what is usual as compared to the maintenance costs for other similar yachts," the judge wrote in the ruling.


The U.S. government could not prove the expenses met that standard, the court ruled. The Justice Department has the right to appeal the decision.


Two days after the ruling, lawyers representing Khudainatov and the company that directly owns the Amadea filed a memorandum opposing the U.S. government's efforts to strike Khudainatov from the case. Prosecutors allege that Khudainatov is not the yacht's actual owner, meaning he lacks standing to contest its forfeiture.


But the memorandum, which includes declarations from yacht employees and contractors, argues that Khudainatov is the true owner and, thus, the Amadea is not subject to forfeiture at all.


The U.S. government's attempts to strike Khudainatov from the case are "nothing more than a desperate attempt to steal the Amadea by default," Adam Ford and Renee Jarusinsky, counsel for Khudainatov and the ownership company, said in a statement.


"Mr. Khudainatov is, and always has been, the rightful owner of the Amadea," they continued. "We are confident that the truth will prevail and the boat will be returned. Until then, this costly burden that the government has placed on the American people will continue to grow heavier."


The Justice Department declined to comment.

## VP Harris to address Ukraine summit, meet Zelenskyy

date: 2024-06-14, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris will attend the international Ukraine Peace Summit in Switzerland this weekend, where she will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and address world leaders.


She will underscore that the outcome of the war with Russia affects the entire world, a U.S. official said, and push for a maximum number of countries to back the notion that Moscow's invasion of Ukraine is a violation of the U.N. Charter's founding principles and that Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected.


Harris, who will spend less than 24 hours at the gathering in Lucerne, Switzerland, will be standing in for President Joe Biden at the event. The president will be just ending his participation at the G7 summit in Italy and returning to the United States to attend a fundraiser for his reelection campaign in Los Angeles.


Harris will meet with Zelenskyy and will address the summit's plenary session. Biden met Zelenskyy at the G7 summit, where they signed a U.S.-Ukraine bilateral security agreement, and in France for events surrounding the 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion.


Harris was to depart for Switzerland on Friday night, arrive Saturday midday and spend several hours at the event before flying back to Washington.


Then, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan will represent the United States at the summit on Sunday and help establish working groups on returning Ukrainian children from Russia and energy security.


Russia was not invited to the event and has dismissed it as futile. China, a key Russian ally, says it will not attend the conference because it does not meet Beijing's requirements, including the participation of Russia.


The senior U.S. official said Russia's absence would not affect the summit but expressed regret at Beijing's decision.


Ninety-two countries and eight organizations plan to attend.


The United States has contributed billions of dollars in weaponry to help Ukraine fight the war begun by Russian President Vladimir Putin, although the latest massive package of aid from Washington was delayed for months by disagreements in Congress.

## 600 US troops remain in Niger as withdrawal continues

date: 2024-06-14, from: VOA News USA

Pentagon — About 600 U.S. military personnel remain in Niger, as American troops continue to withdraw from the country before a mid-September deadline, according to a senior U.S. defense official.


"We are on track to be done before the 15th of September," the senior U.S. defense official told reporters Friday, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive security issues. However, the official cautioned that the rainy season could potentially slow withdrawal efforts.


Last month, U.S. and Nigerien leaders agreed to a phased withdrawal of American forces from Niger after being in the country for more than a decade.


At that time, there were about 900 U.S. military personnel in Niger, including active duty, civilians and contractors, according to two U.S. officials, who spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity ahead of the withdrawal agreement.


The withdrawal agreement between the U.S. and Niger confirmed protections and immunities for U.S. personnel and approved diplomatic clearances for withdrawal flights "to ensure smooth entries and exits."


American forces were deployed in Niger to help local militaries combat Islamist terrorists in the Sahel.


The United States has used two military bases in the country — Air Base 101 in Niamey and Air Base 201 in Agadez — to monitor various terror groups. Most U.S. forces in Niger are currently based in the latter, which cost the U.S. $110 million to build, and began drone operations in 2019.




Niger's natural resources have increased its importance to global powers, and its location had provided the U.S. with the ability to conduct counterterror operations throughout much of West Africa.


Countries in the region, including Niger, Mali, Nigeria and Burkina Faso, have seen an expansive rise in extremist movements.


According to the Global Terrorism Index, an annual report covering terrorist incidents worldwide, more than half of the deaths caused by terrorism last year were in the Sahel.


Niger's neighbor, Burkina Faso, suffered the most, with 1,907 fatalities from terrorism in 2023.


Unless the U.S. can find another base to use in West Africa, counterterror drones will likely have to spend most of their fuel supply flying thousands of kilometers from U.S. bases in Italy or Djibouti, severely limiting their time over the targets and their ability to gather intelligence.


"That's a significant policy matter that the U.S. is grappling with right now," the senior U.S. defense official told reporters Friday.


Coup forced withdrawal 


Tensions between the U.S. and Niger began in 2023 when Niger's military junta removed the democratically elected president from power.


After months of delay, the Biden administration formally declared in October 2023 that the military takeover in Niger was a coup, a determination that prevented Niger from receiving a significant amount of U.S. military and foreign assistance.


In March, after tense meetings between U.S. representatives and Niger's governing military council, the junta called the U.S. military presence illegal and announced it was ending an agreement that allowed American forces to be based in the country.


During that meeting, the U.S. and Niger fundamentally disagreed about Niger's desire to supply Iran with uranium and work more closely with Russian military forces.

## The Little Weather Balloon Company Taking on Google DeepMind

date: 2024-06-14, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjQ1MTczMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NDk1OTE4NH0.mocmAt04nFYLY0Iy2qoS5p1C9AizAQzKc9xR-ZrKOFk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">It’s been a wild few years in the typically tedious world of weather predictions. For decades, forecasts have been improving at a slow and steady pace — the standard metric is that every decade of development leads to a <em><em>one-day improvement</em></em> in lead time. So today, our four-day forecasts are about as accurate as a one-day forecast was 30 years ago. Whoop-de-do.<br/></p><p>Now thanks to advances in (you guessed it) artificial intelligence, things are moving much more rapidly. AI-based weather models from tech giants such as <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/graphcast-ai-model-for-faster-and-more-accurate-global-weather-forecasting/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Google DeepMind</u></a>, <a href="https://www.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/about/takeacloudleap2024/ai-weather-prediction.html#:~:text=Pangu%2DWeather%20can%20generate%20a,and%20heat%20waves%2C%20and%20more." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Huawei</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/high-performance-computing/earth-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Nvidia</u></a> are now consistently beating the standard physics-based models for the first time. And it’s not just the big names getting into the game — earlier this year, the 27-person team at Palo Alto-based startup Windborne one-upped DeepMind to become the world’s most accurate weather forecaster. </p><p>“What we’ve seen for some metrics is just the deployment of an AI-based emulator can gain us a day in lead time relative to traditional models,” Daryl Kleist, who works on weather model development at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told me. That is, today’s <em><em>two-day</em></em> forecast could be as accurate as last year’s <em><em>one-day</em></em> forecast.</p><p>All weather models start by taking in data about current weather conditions. But from there, how they make predictions varies wildly. Traditional weather models like the ones NOAA and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts use rely on complex atmospheric equations based on the laws of physics to predict future weather patterns. AI models, on the other hand, are trained on decades of prior weather data, using the past to predict what will come next. </p><p>Kleist told me he certainly saw AI-based weather forecasting coming, but the speed at which it’s arriving and the degree to which these models are improving has been head-spinning. “There's papers coming out in preprints almost on a bi-weekly basis. And the amount of skill they've been able to gain by fine tuning these things and taking it a step further has been shocking, frankly,” he told me.</p><p>So what changed? As the world has seen with the advent of large language models like ChatGPT, AI architecture has gotten much more powerful, period. The weather models themselves are also in a cycle of continuous improvement — as more open source weather data becomes available, models can be retrained. Plus, the cost of computing power has come way down, making it possible for a small company like Windborne to train its industry-leading model.</p><p>Founded by a team of Stanford students and graduates in 2019, Windborne used off-the-shelf Nvidia gaming GPUs to train its AI model, called WeatherMesh — something the company’s CEO and co-founder, John Dean, told me wouldn’t have been possible five years ago. The company also operates its own fleet of advanced weather balloons, which gather data from traditionally difficult-to-access areas. </p><p>Standard weather balloons without onboard navigation typically ascend too high, overinflate, and pop within a matter of hours (thus becoming environmental waste, sad!). Since it’s expensive to do launches at sea or in areas without much infrastructure, there’s vast expanses of the globe where most balloons aren’t gathering any data at all. </p><p>Satellites can help, of course. But because they’re so far away, they can’t provide the same degree of fidelity. With modern electronics, though, Windborne found it could create a balloon that autonomously changes altitude and navigates to its intended target by venting gas to descend and dropping ballast to ascend.</p><p>“We basically took a lot of the innovations that lead to smartphones, global satellite communications, all of the last 20 years of progress in consumer electronics and other things and applied that to balloons,” Dean told me. In the past, the electronics needed to control Windborne’s system would have been too heavy — the balloon wouldn’t have gotten off the ground. But with today’s tiny tech, they can stay aloft for up to 40 days. Eventually, the company aims to recover and reuse at least 80% of its balloons.</p><p>The longer airtime allows Windborne to do more with less. While globally there are more than 1,000 conventional weather balloons launched every day, Dean told me, “We collect roughly on the order of 10% or 20% of the data that NOAA collects every day with only 100 launches per month.” In fact, NOAA is a customer of the startup — Windborne already makes millions in revenue selling its weather balloon data to various government agencies. </p><p>Now, with a <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/noaa-hurricane-forecast-2024" target="_self"><u>potentially historic hurricane season</u></a> ramping up, Windborne has the potential to provide the most accurate data on when and where a storm will touch down. </p><p>Earlier this year, the company used WeatherMesh to run a case study on Hurricane Ian, the Category 5 storm that hit Florida in September 2022, leading to over 150 fatalities and $112 billion in damages. Using only weather data that was publicly available at the time, the company looked at how accurately its model (had it existed back then) would have tracked the hurricane. </p><p><a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6632dda48ccd4f1eda19ea97/6632e74d8fe1dd5d1fa03f8f_Ian%20Map.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Very accurately</u></a>, it turns out. Windborne’s predictions aligned neatly with the storm’s actual path, while the National Weather Service’s model was off by hundreds of kilometers. That impressed Khosla Ventures, which led the company’s $15 million Series A funding round earlier this month. “We haven’t seen meaningful innovation in weather since The Weather Channel in the 90s. Yet it’s a $100 billion market that touches essentially every industry,” Sven Strohband, a partner and managing director at Khosla Ventures, told me via email. </p><p>With this new funding, Windborne is scaling up its fleet of balloons as it prepares to commercialize. The money will also help Windborne advance its forecasting model, though Dean told me robust data collection is ultimately what will set the company apart. “In any kind of AI industry, whoever has the top benchmark at any given time, it’s going to fluctuate,” Dean said. “What matters is the model plus the unique datasets.”</p><p>Unlike Windborne, the tech giants with AI-based weather models — including, most recently, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-aurora-the-first-large-scale-foundation-model-of-the-atmosphere/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Microsoft</u></a> — aren’t gathering their own data, instead drawing solely on publicly accessible information from legacy weather agencies. </p><p>But these agencies are starting to get into the game, too. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts has already created its own AI-based model, <a href="https://www.ecmwf.int/en/newsletter/178/news/aifs-new-ecmwf-forecasting-system" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the Artificial Intelligence/Integrated Forecasting System</u></a>, which it runs in parallel to its traditional model. NOAA, while a bit behind, is also looking to follow suit. </p><p>“In the end, we know we can't rely on these big tech companies to just keep developing stuff in good faith to give to us for free,” Kleist told me. Right now, many of the top AI-based weather models are open source. But who knows if that will last? “It's our mission to save lives and property. And we have to figure out how to do some of this development and operationalize it from our side, ourselves,” Kleist said, explaining that NOAA is currently prototyping some of its own AI-based models. </p><p>All of these agencies are in the early stages of AI modeling, which is why you likely haven’t noticed weather predictions making a pronounced leap in accuracy as of late. It’s all still considered quite experimental. “Physical models, the pro is we know the underlying assumptions we make. We understand them. We have decades of history of developing them and using them in operational settings,” Kleist told me. AI-based models are much more of a black box, and there’s questions surrounding how well they will perform when it comes to predicting rare weather events, for which there might be little to no historical data for the model to reference. </p><p>That hesitation might not last long, though. “To me it’s fairly obvious that most of the forecasts that would actually be used by users in the future will come from machine learning models,” Peter Dueben, head of Earth systems modeling at the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, told me. “If you just want to get the weather forecast for the temperature in California tomorrow, then the machine learning model is typically the better choice,” he added.</p><p>That increased accuracy is going to matter a lot, not just for the average weather watcher, but also for specific industries and interest groups for whom precise predictions are paramount. “We can tailor the actual models to particular sectors, whether it's agriculture, energy, transportation,” Kleist told me, “and come up with information that's going to be at a very granular, specific level to a particular interest.” Think grid operators or renewable power generators who need to forecast demand or farmers trying to figure out the best time to irrigate their fields or harvest crops. </p><p>A major (and perhaps surprising) reason this type of customization is so easy is because once AI-based weather models are trained, they’re actually orders of magnitude cheaper and less computationally intensive to run than traditional models. All of this means, Kleist told me, that AI-based weather models are “going to be fundamentally foundational for what we do in the future, and will open up avenues to things we couldn't have imagined using our current physical-based modeling.”</p>

## Supreme Court strikes down Trump-era ban on bump stocks

date: 2024-06-14, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Friday struck down a Trump-era ban on bump stocks, a rapid-fire gun accessory that was used in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.


The high court's conservative majority found that the Trump administration did not follow federal law when it changed course from previous administrations after a gunman in Las Vegas attacked a country music festival with assault rifles equipped with bump stocks.


The accessory allows a rate of fire comparable to machine guns.


The gunman fired more than 1,000 rounds in the crowd in 11 minutes, sending thousands of people fleeing in terror as hundreds were wounded and dozens were killed in 2017.


The 6-3 majority opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas said a semiautomatic rifle with a bump stock is not an illegal machine gun because it doesn’t make the weapon fire more than one shot with one pull of the trigger.


“A bump stock does not alter the basic mechanics of bump firing, and the trigger still must be released and reengaged to fire each additional shot,” he wrote in an opinion that contained multiple drawings of guns’ firing mechanisms.


He was joined by his fellow conservatives. Justice Samuel Alito wrote a short separate opinion to stress that Congress can change the law to equate bump stocks with machine guns.


Changing the definition of a bump stock through regulation rather than legislation took pressure off Republicans in Congress to act or justify inaction in the face of the Las Vegas massacre during Trump's presidency.


In a dissent joined by her liberal colleagues, Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed to the Las Vegas gunman. “In murdering so many people so quickly, he did not rely on a quick trigger finger. Instead, he relied on bump stocks,” she said, reading a summary of her dissent aloud in the courtroom. Sotomayor said that it’s “deeply regrettable” Congress has to act but that she hopes it does.




Former President Donald Trump's 2024 campaign team said it respects the court's decision in a statement that quickly pivoted to politics, touting his endorsement by the National Rifle Association. President Joe Biden did not have an immediate comment.


The ruling came after a Texas gun shop owner challenged the ban, arguing the Justice Department wrongly classified the accessories as illegal machine guns.


The Biden administration said that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives made the right choice for the gun accessories, which can allow weapons to fire at a rate of hundreds of rounds a minute.


It marked the latest gun case to come before the high court. A conservative supermajority handed down a landmark decision expanding gun rights in 2022 and is weighing another gun case challenging a federal law intended to keep guns away from people under domestic violence restraining orders.


The arguments in the bump stock case, though, were more about whether the ATF had overstepped its authority than the Second Amendment.


Justices from the court’s liberal wing suggested it was “common sense” that anything capable of unleashing a “torrent of bullets” was a machine gun under federal law. Conservative justices, though, raised questions about why Congress had not acted to ban bump stocks, as well as the effects of the ATF changing its mind a decade after declaring the accessories legal.


The high court took up the case after a split among lower courts over bump stocks, which were invented in the early 2000s. Under Republican President George W. Bush and Democrat Barack Obama, the ATF decided that bump stocks didn’t transform semiautomatic weapons into machine guns. The agency reversed those decisions at Trump’s urging after the shooting in Las Vegas and another mass shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school that killed 17 people.


Bump stocks are accessories that replace a rifle’s stock, the part that rests against the shoulder. They harness the gun’s recoil energy so that the trigger bumps against the shooter’s stationary finger, allowing the gun to fire at a rate comparable to a traditional machine gun. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have their own bans on bump stocks.




The plaintiff, Texas gun shop owner and military veteran Michael Cargill, was represented by the New Civil Liberties Alliance, a group funded by conservative donors such as the Koch network. His attorneys acknowledged that bump stocks allow for rapid fire but argued that they are different because the shooter has to put in more effort to keep the gun firing.


Government lawyers countered that the effort required from the shooter is small and doesn’t make a legal difference. The Justice Department said the ATF changed its mind on bump stocks after doing a more in-depth examination spurred by the Las Vegas shooting and came to the right conclusion.


There were about 520,000 bump stocks in circulation when the ban went into effect in 2019, requiring people to either surrender or destroy them, at a combined estimated loss of $100 million, the plaintiffs said in court documents.

## Microsoft delays Recall feature

date: 2024-06-14, from: OS News

After initially announcing it was going to change its Recall feature and then pulling the preview Windows release containing the feature, Microsoft has now given in almost entirely and is delaying Recall altogether. Instead of shipping it on every new Copilot+ PC, they&#8217;re going to release it as an optional feature for Windows Insiders. Today, we are communicating an additional update on the Recall (preview) feature for Copilot+ PCs. Recall will now shift from a preview experience broadly available for Copilot+ PCs on June 18, 2024, to a preview available first in the Windows Insider Program (WIP) in the coming weeks. Following receiving feedback on Recall from our Windows Insider Community, as we typically do, we plan to make Recall (preview) available for all Copilot+ PCs coming soon. ↫ Pavan Davuluri on the Windows blog It&#8217;s incredible just how much Microsoft has bungled the launch of this feature, as it&#8217;s now almost overshadowing everything else that comes with these new ARM laptops. They rushed to shove machine learning into a major feature, and didn&#8217;t stop to think about the consequences. Typical Silicon Valley behaviour.

<p>Four years ago, the pandemic sent the world economy into disarray. Panic buying led to widespread backlogs, with shipping gridlocks so bad you could see them in satellite images. It all revealed a troubling reality: Our global supply chain is incredibly fragile. Where did things go wrong? We discuss. Also, Tesla shareholders voted to restore CEO Elon Musk’s pay package valued at $44.9 billion, so let&#8217;s talk about how CEO pay gets determined.</p>

## Escaping the 9-5

date: 2024-06-14, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog


<div class="e-content entry-content">
<p><img src="https://werd.io/file/666c45c128a955354b0c7ef2/thumb.jpg" alt="The silhouette of a man holding his arms out, representing freedom" width="1024" height="683"></p><p>Imagine a life where you dictate your own schedule, free from the confines of a traditional job.</p><p>That’s a thought experiment I’ve been playing with lately: what would it look like if this <em>was</em> my last ever job? How might I optimize my lifestyle for freedom?</p><p>By that I don’t mean that it would be the last time I needed to earn money. I work <a href="https://propublica.org">in non-profit news</a>; nobody does this because they want to become rich beyond their wildest dreams. Even tech salaries feel distant from this vantage point. To be clear, I’m doing this work because it’s important, and I have no plans to leave.</p><p>Regardless, I think it’s an important thought experiment. What if this was the last time I worked a job with regular hours and a boss and a hierarchy? What would it look like to have a lifestyle that was less bound to working norms, so that I could choose how to spend my day, or my week, or my year?</p><p>This desire to seek a lifestyle less bound by traditional working norms is shaped by two big influences:</p><ul><li>My working life in startups, which was very much self-driven</li>
<li>My own parents, who had their own publishing startup for a key part of my childhood.</li>
</ul><p>My parents’ ability to dictate their schedules and norms meant that I was able to have childhood experiences — in particular, trips to mainland Europe and the US — that would have been much harder otherwise. (These things didn’t need all that much money; they needed <em>time</em>.) That lifestyle did something else important, too: it showed me that it was attainable, and that a person doesn’t <em>need</em> a 9-5 to live. That perspective, in turn, allowed me to become a founder and build new things.</p><p>I would like to do the same for our son. Honestly, selfishly, I would also like to do it for me.</p><p>What are the roads to more independence when you aren’t independently wealthy?</p><p>Here are some options I’ve considered:</p><h3>Startups</h3><p>The first potential path to independence is through entrepreneurship.</p><p>I’ve founded two startups in my life. The first one was bootstrapped for the first couple of years before raising a round from British investors; the second was kicked off with a small amount ($50K) of accelerator seed money.</p><p>My life has changed since then. In particular, my capital needs have shot up. There’s a child and daycare and a mortgage in the picture, which is radically different from my life as a twenty-something prepared to live on Pot Noodles and scrape by with little money. A working life of open source, mission-driven startups, and non-profit news means that my savings are meager and wouldn’t support a new venture. A friends and family round is out of the question for me, as it is for anyone who doesn’t come from wealth.</p><p>Building a startup means working hard on it while holding down my day job, until it reaches the point where it has enough traction to raise a seed round. The barrier for that traction is rising steadily; it probably needs to be making tens of thousands of dollars a month for a seed investor to find it interesting. Still, that isn’t insurmountable — particularly with a co-founder. I have more product, engineering, and organizational growth skills than ever before, and I believe that I could do it.</p><p><em>But also</em>: at the point where it’s making tens of thousands of dollars a month, assuming a low running cost, that’s more than enough to sustain me! It doesn’t need to be a high-growth startup. It could be a small business that is content to do quite well. <a href="https://www.zebrasunite.org/">A Zebra, perhaps.</a> The disadvantage is that the upside is limited: it’s unlikely to make me wealthy beyond my wildest dreams. But what if that isn’t the goal? If the goal is <em>freedom</em>, a modest income is wonderful.</p><h3>Consulting or Coaching</h3><p>I have coaching training, and I’ve previously coached founders across a portfolio of mission-driven startups. In many ways, my roles as a CTO / Head of Engineering / Director of Technology have been largely coaching-based too: effective 1:1s and frameworks for feedback are the lifeblood of building a team.</p><p>I’ve also got strong product design and design thinking training, and have run workshops and design sprints with many teams. I understand product fundamentals, how to instill product thinking in a team, and can shepherd a product (and product team) from insight to launch.</p><p>And I’m technical. I can architect software and write code; I can advise teams about how to think about new technologies like AI, or how to build their own software. I’ve done this in many different contexts, many, many times.</p><p>So I think I can offer a lot. The challenge with consulting of any kind, though, is that it’s essentially a freelance job: you’re working from contract to contract, or from session to session, which means that you’re constantly having to sell yourself for the next thing, at least until your reputation has reached the point where people are asking for you.</p><p>Perhaps a retainer model would work: enough people subscribing to receive your attention and you have a steady income. Too many, though, and you can’t support them all. Too few, and you need to be in sales mode all the time. Still, it seems attractive from the provider end; the question, of course, is whether any customers would actually go for that. My guess is probably not — at least until you have enough glowing referrals.</p><h3>Selling Products</h3><p>In a way, this seems like the most attractive option: sell a finite product that doesn’t require your direct involvement, so that you can spend your time building the <em>next</em> product to sell, until you have a portfolio of products that sell without you and generate a reasonable income.</p><p>There are plenty of influencers who peddle “passive income”. My strong belief is that they’re all scammers, and that the dream of financial independence is what they’re all <em>actually</em> selling. Still, there are clearly people who sell things on the internet, and some of them do quite well.</p><p>These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Books:</strong> Yay for books! Of course, the idea that you’ll make an income from books alone is a pipe dream. Even bestselling published authors often don’t leave their jobs until they’ve had a few successes in a row. There are more books being published and it’s harder to break out. Full disclosure: I am writing a book! But I don’t expect it to cover my costs. I’m doing it because there’s a story I want to tell. (And then I’ll do it again, because there are more stories to tell.)</li>
<li><strong>Courses:</strong> Do people really make a lot of money from these? I mean, maybe. It feels like courses mostly fall into the same category as books: something you do because you want to share some knowledge or potentially demonstrate some expertise, but not something you do as a money-making venture in its own right.</li>
<li><strong>Apps:</strong> Hmm. This was a great idea in 2008. Some software really does support independent developers, though — but my suspicion is that the software that does the <em>best</em> are actually services, which fit better into my “startup / small business” description above.</li>
</ul><h3>A Portfolio</h3><p>I think this is the real answer: it isn’t just one thing. Likely, a repeatable income is cobbled together from threads of at least some of the above elements: building a service, offering coaching or consulting, and selling individual products.</p><p>One danger here is that attention is spread too thinly: because multiple threads are required, you necessarily have less time to spend on each. Consequently, the quality of each element may suffer.</p><p>This approach no longer puts all eggs in one basket, which means there’s (in theory) more tolerance for one thread to fail. But it also means that you’re spinning plates in order to try and keep them all working. Because there’s less time for each, and attention is split, there’s a real chance of <em>all of them</em> failing.</p><p>Still, overall, it feels like the most resilient approach, with the most room for experimentation. It’s by no means the least work, but minimizing work isn’t the goal: that would be maximizing freedom, which isn’t the same thing.</p><p>What do you think? Have you made this leap? Did it work for you? I’d love to learn more.</p></div>

## The financial war between Israel and the Palestinians

date: 2024-06-14, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Israel is withholding $35 million in tax revenues from the Palestinian Authority, which provides limited self-governance for the Palestinian people in the West Bank. The move threatens to worsen an already dire financial situation there, even as a war devastates Gaza, the other Palestinian enclave. Plus, big questions linger following the end of a strike at University of California campuses. And Wells Fargo fired some employees for &#8220;fake working.&#8221;</p>

## The Encyclopedia Project, or How to Know in the Age of AI

Books were not infallible; the stamp of a traditional publisher was not a sign that the information was correct or trustworthy. The web allowed more diverse voices to be heard.

## P&B: Jessica Nickelsen

date: 2024-06-14, from: Manu - I write blog

<hr />
<h2>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Jessica. Jess really. I live in Wellington, New Zealand. I've lived in New Zealand on and off since 1990, when my family moved here from the States. My mother is a kiwi and Dad's american. They met when my dad came out to NZ as a ski instructor in the 60s.</p>
<p>I had a "very American" childhood and briefly went to Junior High School before moving. One of my favourite stories from that time is that everyone at my new school wanted to know if my old school was "like Beverly Hills 90210." I had to break it to them that no, my junior high in Vancover, Washington wasn't exactly the same, though we did have lockers and foosball tables and fake-cheese nachos for lunch, haha.</p>
<p>I went to university in NZ - a place called Otago University in Dunedin. It's a university town waaaaay down in the South Island. It's an awesome city, a bit wild--it even has an albatross colony. I started off as pre-med, because I always enjoyed science and maths at school, but then veered off when I failed Chemistry. I studied music, archaeology, geology, history, english. At one point I was going to do my degree in geology but then at the end I wound up doing English literature. Later on when I was working in IT and bored, I finished my honours degree, part-time. Somehow I studied the Old Norse language (we translated excerpts from the Eddas, as well as some amazing prose stuff) and also wrote my thesis on Literature and Technology. I think I've always been all over the place.</p>
<p>I still work in IT, and it's still boring, even though I am just part time these days (my husband and I have an eleven-year-old daughter and I do all the runaround stuff with her too). But maybe that lets me focus on everything else I do. I have a lot of hobbies, but I've probably run out of room to talk about them here. But a few that could be worth mentioning are my writing of course, as well as some assistant editorial stuff I do for Utopia Science Fiction magazine. I like taking photos and develop film as well. I play piano and do karate. I knit socks. I was a video game reviewer for ten years too.</p>
<h2>What's the story behind your blog?</h2>
<p>I actually have a few blogs. I think you found me through my writing one? I was wanting to self-publish some books and thought I needed a blog with my name on it to do it properly. That one has all of my books on it, but I guess my "real" blog is the one at discombobulated.co.nz, though that's had a few iterations over the years.</p>
<p>It started out in 2000, when I was doing my "OE" (or Overseas Experience, what kiwis call the migration of most NZ young people overseas for an indefinite period of time) in Dublin. I lived and worked there for about three years. I had another boring IT job and decided when I was sitting around waiting for releases (I was working as a localisation engineer at Microsoft) I might as well do something online. I found a service called Diary-x that some of your readers might remember. My domain in those days was herself.diary-x.com, but the blog itself was named "Discombobulated in Dublin." A sort of Sleepless in Seattle reference, I guess, but I really was discombobulated in those days so it seemed to fit.</p>
<p>That all fell over, and the owner confessed that he hadn't made any backups, or the backups had failed, or something. It was my first introduction to the concept of resiliency and I guess it was a good lesson, because I still adhere to the concept of <a href="https://www.veritas.com/information-center/3-2-1-backup-rule">3-2-1</a> with most of my stuff. Later I moved to Wordpress like everyone else, and I think it was then that I first bought my domain (discombobulated.co.nz). I like having a 'co.nz' domain. I think it's cute. I'm in the process of trying to bring over all of my old wordpress posts but that may take some time.</p>
<h2>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</h2>
<p>My blog is a completely personal one, so I don't tend to write multiple drafts or get proofreading done. I figure any typos or weirdness is just part of the experience, which is less about a professional image and more of a slice-of-life moment.</p>
<p>I've always struggled with the way blogging changed so much and became just another way for people to market things or sell you stuff. I really did enjoy how it was back in the early days, where you would follow people and get a sense of their internal monologues, what it was like for them to live in certain places. I've always loved having little windows into other people's lives.</p>
<p>So basically my process is, I go, "hm, it's been a while, I should probably do a blog post." And sometimes I start with the weather, or I have some news I want to write about. Or I look back through some recent photographs and find one I want to write about. Sometimes I note down quotes I like from books I'm reading, or the post might turn into a longer piece about an actual topic. But most of the time they are just stream-of-consciousness brain dumps. (Sorry.)</p>
<p>I guess it is pretty self-absorbed, really, writing like this and making it public. But I just think back on those blogs that I really loved in the past, and how it made me feel when I read them. And I sort of want to re-create that, I guess. So those are my touchstones, in a way. A vague guiding principle.</p>
<h2>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</h2>
<p>I'm not too concerned about where I write, although I really don't like the feeling that someone might be behind me, looking over my shoulder. I used to work in an open office, back in my office IT days, and I could never get used to the feeling.</p>
<p>For the most part I write at my desk in my study--I have a mac mini and a nice big screen. (I also work from home, but that's on a windows machine, so everything is pretty separate.) I'm also quite happy typing in bed on my laptop too; for some reason generally I find writing in bed works really well for me. On the weekends I really like opening the door to the balcony by the bed and sitting there to write.</p>
<p>I keep quite a few notebooks and I journal in those, but composing a blog post in a notebook feels a little strange. Recently I've set up a chair outside the study, under some punga ferns that hang over the fence there, and I have found that sitting there with a notebook, and brain.fm on my headphones has been pretty wild in terms of getting into the zone.</p>
<p>Probably like most people I'm drawn to beautiful photos of desks in minimal offices, or a spot at a beautiful cafe, but to be honest by the time I'm in the flow of writing I hardly even notice my surroundings. I'm in that in-between space, somewhere between the text on the screen and my brain.</p>
<p>I'd love to work other places apart from home, but the libraries in New Zealand are pretty much public spaces these days, and because most of them are small and suburban (our big one in Wellington is currently out of action due to earthquake strengthening) there aren't many places to just find a quiet desk. There's also a bit of a mood among cafes where they don't seem to like you "bludging" a seat for too long. Of course there are coworking spaces--I even signed up for one a while ago, but they are pretty expensive and it's just a bit hard to justify.</p>
<h2>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</h2>
<p>Sure! My writing blog is one of those Jekyll templates hosted on GitHub pages, though I am looking at simplifying that. (It also got a really bad score on the websitecarbon.com website, which is another reason I'm considering moving.) What I do really like about it is that I have the site mirrored locally, and I can edit the html and css in Zed (<a href="https://zed.dev">https://zed.dev</a>) (currently my code editor of choice, though I sometimes go back to Vim). I like writing a post in a text file and then pushing a copy out to where it's hosted. It feels more like writing that way.</p>
<p>My personal blog is similar, though I use Blot.im for that. All the files sit on Dropbox, and everything just syncs and updates as I edit them. I have the templates and structure sitting there and it's very easy to make changes.</p>
<p>I recently implemented a weird sort of flow though, involving Obsidian and an automator folder monitoring workflow. I have, in Obsidian, a Blog folder, with drafts and posts subfolders. I create a draft blog post based on a template I've created with the right YAML front matter, write it in Obsidian, and then when I'm ready, I drag it over to the posts folder. Once it arrives there, automator kicks in and makes a copy to my Blot folder.</p>
<p>I like writing blog posts in markdown in Obsidian; everything syncs to GitHub pretty easily. The only faff is with implementing photos, which I usually resize by hand and copy to an assets folder within the Blot structure. But it's easy enough to implement without too much flicking around.</p>
<p>I don't know if this seems really weird or not. But I've come to realise that I really dislike writing anything in a web browser; everything just feels very slow and mouse-oriented. My next challenge is to try and find a newsletter option that I can use in a similar way. If anyone has any suggestions I'd love to hear them!</p>
<p>Both my domains are registered through 1stdomains.nz. I couldn't even tell you why I first signed up with them. The site is a bit clunky but I like that they are a kiwi company.</p>
<h2>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</h2>
<p>Going way back, I think despite everything that happened with the diary-x fiasco, it was a really great place to hang out and meet other people online. (I even reconnected with someone on micro.blog who I had been friends with back in those days; it was very surreal!) I think all I would do differently really is make sure I kept even some basic text copies of what I'd written--even the wayback machine hasn't been able to find everything.</p>
<p>I do think that using Wordpress was a bit of a lesson in how hard it can be to get everything out of a hulking CMS. Yes there are some good scripts that can do it, but I still have over three hundred posts that I have to now go back through and sort the links for images. It's just turned into a complete chore.</p>
<p>More recently, I think I wish I'd just used the shortened version of my name for the author blog. Jess Nickelsen rather than Jessica Nickelsen. It seems like a small thing, but Jess feels more like me. Maybe I'll just do it, heh!</p>
<h2>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising personal blogs?</h2>
<p>The domain names are around $30 NZ a year, each. Blot is about $20 USD a year, because I got in on early pricing quite a few years ago. I think it's around $60 a year now.</p>
<p>(I also have mini blogs with omg.lol; those are $20 USD a year but I think I subscribed when they were having a sale. I also pay for micro.blog because I really like what they are doing there and it's a lovely community. That's $5 USD a month.)</p>
<p>I don't have anything against people monetising their blogs at all, but don't you think that a monetised blog has a different feel? They become more...performative? Less of a window and more of a presentation? I guess in my mind I separate those sort of blogs out into the same realm as recipe blogs or youtube channels. It becomes more about a business and less about openness. And while I completely understand that for some people this is their main form of income, I almost wish there was another name for "this sort of thing," other than "blog."</p>
<p>I'm really still just working out my thoughts on the whole thing. Maybe my stumbling block is that I'm a Gen-Xer who remembers when all of this was just a giant playground, and now it's all become quite serious.</p>
<h2>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</h2>
<p>Ohh, this is hard. There are so many interesting blogs out there, and I love that this is a problem. It was awesome to see you interviewing some bloggers who I genuinely love reading (like Adrianna Tan, Derek Sivers and Winnie Lim). Here are a few other blogs that I really like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arnoldhoogerwerf.nl">arnoldhoogerwerf.nl</a> - he does all sorts of interesting field recordings in nature and sometimes makes films to accompany them</li>
<li><a href="https://wonderpens.ca/blogs/uncategorized">wonderpens.ca</a> - though they are a stationery shop, this is a commercial blog I genuinely enjoy; sincere and well-written, with lovely photography.</li>
<li><a href="https://saigonboy.me">saigonboy.me</a> I discovered this blog while I was investigating Montaigne.io (which still looks pretty cool; a blog created via apple notes?) This is a snippety sort of travel blog, with illustrations rather than photographs. I really like it.</li>
<li><a href="https://danwang.co">danwang.co</a> - Dan Wang pretty much does just one post a year, but I've been reading them for a few years now and always feel smarter and more human after reading them.</li>
<li><a href="https://muan.co">muan.co</a> - I like Mu-An Chiou's blog (it's dreamy) but she's also got a nice mix of personal and professional there too.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.robertvanvliet.com">robertvanvliet.com</a> - Robert Van Vliet's blog is a nice example of how I'd like to bring my two blogs together. He also seems quite dreamy and artsy as well as being techy, which is a nice combination.</li>
<li><a href="https://brainbaking.com">brainbaking.com</a> - I think Winnie Lim also recommended this blog. It's another one of my favourites as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</h2>
<p>Thanks to mental floss I was able to track down the very first web page I think I ever visited on the internet: <a href="http://www.pmichaud.com/toast/">Strawberry Pop-Tart Blow-Torches</a>. It gave me such genuine delight to know this page still exists!</p>
<p>Also check out Anthony Alvarado's <em>DIY Magic</em>. It's such a great book on creativity!</p>

This NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image features the globular cluster NGC 2005. It’s not an unusual globular cluster in and of itself, but it is a peculiarity when compared to its surroundings.

## How Apache Spark lit up the tech world and outshone its big data brethren

date: 2024-06-14, updated: 2024-06-15, from: The Register (UK I.T. News)

<h4>El Reg queries author Matei Zaharia on a decade of the project</h4> <p><strong>Interview</strong>  Big data is no longer hailed as the "new oil." It has gone out of fashion, both in terms of hype and because its foundational technology – Apache Hadoop – was surpassed by cloud-based blob storage such as AWS S3. However, a sister project born in the big data era has become more influential in the modern world of LLMs and internet-scale data systems.…</p>

**@Dave Winer's linkblog** (date: 2024-06-14, from: Dave Winer's linkblog)

<p>This is what we don&#39;t do in software -- study each others&#39; creations.</p>
<p>You can barely get anyone to even look at the simplest stuff.</p>
<p>Amazing how people bet their whole careers and businesses without any information on what other people are creating. No wonder new generations of software knock out previous generations. No one has any curiosity, respect.</p>

## Japan's space agency helps to target advertising with satellite photos of crops

## South Florida rainstorms lead to flight delays, streets jammed with stalled cars

date: 2024-06-14, from: VOA News USA

FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida — A tropical disturbance that brought a rare flash flood emergency to much of southern Florida delayed flights at two of the state's largest airports and left vehicles waterlogged and stalled in some of the region's lowest-lying streets.


"Looked like the beginning of a zombie movie," said Ted Rico, a tow truck driver who spent much of Wednesday night and Thursday morning helping to clear the streets of stalled vehicles. "There's cars littered everywhere, on top of sidewalks, in the median, in the middle of the street, no lights on. Just craziness, you know. Abandoned cars everywhere."


Rico, of One Master Trucking Corp., was born and raised in Miami and said he was ready for the emergency.


"You know when it's coming," he said. "Every year it's just getting worse, and for some reason people just keep going through the puddles."


Travelers across the area were trying to adjust their plans on Thursday morning. More than 50 centimeters of rain had fallen in some areas of South Florida since Tuesday, with more predicted over the next few days.


Ticket and security lines snaked around a domestic concourse at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport just before noon Thursday. The travel boards showed about half of that terminal's flights had been canceled or postponed.


Bill Carlisle, a Navy petty officer first class, had spent his morning trying to catch a flight back to Norfolk, Virginia. He had arrived at Miami International Airport about 6:30 a.m., but 90 minutes later he was still in line and realized he couldn't get his bags checked and through security in time to catch his flight.


"It was a zoo," said Carlisle, a public affairs specialist. He was speaking for himself, not the Navy. "Nothing against the [airport] employees — there is only so much they can do."




He used his phone to book an afternoon flight out of Fort Lauderdale. He took a shuttle the 32 kilometers north, only to find that the flight had been canceled. He was then heading back to Miami for a 9 p.m. flight, hoping it wouldn't get canceled by the heavy rains expected later in the day. He was resigned, not angry.


"Just a long day sitting in airports," Carlisle said. "This is kind of par for the course for government travel."


Wednesday's downpours and subsequent flooding blocked roads, floated vehicles and even delayed the Florida Panthers on their way to Stanley Cup games in Canada against the Edmonton Oilers.


The disorganized storm system was pushing across Florida from the Gulf of Mexico at roughly the same time as the early June start of hurricane season, which this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory amid concerns that climate change is increasing storm intensity.


The disturbance has not reached cyclone status and was given only a slight chance to form into a tropical system once it moves into the Atlantic Ocean after crossing Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center.


In Hallandale Beach, Alex Demchemko was walking his Russian spaniel Lex along the still-flooded sidewalks near the Airbnb where he's lived since arriving from Russia last month to seek asylum in the U.S.


"We didn't come out from our apartment, but we had to walk with our dog," Demchemko said. "A lot of flashes, raining, a lot of floating cars and a lot of left cars without drivers, and there was a lot of water on the streets. It was kind of catastrophic."


On Thursday morning, Daniela Urrieche, 26, was bailing water out of her SUV, which got stuck on a flooded street as she drove home from work on Wednesday afternoon.


"In the nine years that I've lived here, this has been the worst," she said. "Even in a hurricane, streets were not as bad as it was in the past 24 hours."


The flooding wasn't limited to the streets. Charlea Johnson spent Wednesday night at her Hallendale Beach home barreling water into the sink and toilet.


"The water just started flooding in the back and flooding in the front," Johnson said.


By Wednesday evening, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and mayors in Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood and Miami-Dade County each declared a state of emergency.


It's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 15 centimeters of rain fell Tuesday and 17 centimeters fell in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 12 centimeters.


More rain was forecast for the rest of the week, with some areas getting another 15 centimeters of rain.


The western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 16.5 centimeters of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service said, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.


Forecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.


The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months, including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.

## American held by Taliban needs urgent medical care, UN expert says

date: 2024-06-14, from: VOA News USA

GENEVA — The Taliban must provide Ryan Corbett, an American held in Afghanistan for nearly two years, with immediate medical care to prevent irreparable harm to his health or even his death, a United Nations expert said on Thursday.


"The Taliban must provide Ryan Corbett with medical treatment in a civilian hospital without delay," said Alice Jill Edwards, the U.N. special rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.


Corbett, an aid worker, has been held without charge in conditions "utterly inadequate and substantially below international standards," she said.


"This is having a significant impact on his physical and mental health, which is declining rapidly," Edwards added. She said she had raised the issue directly with the Taliban.


"Without adequate medical care, he is at risk of irreparable harm or even death," she said.


The United States is in contact with Edwards' office and welcomes efforts to call for more humane conditions for Corbett and others held by the Taliban, a spokesperson for the U.S. mission to the United Nations in New York said.


"We consider Ryan's detention to be wrongful and we will continue to work securing his immediate release," the spokesperson said.


Corbett and his family moved to Afghanistan in 2010. He worked with nongovernmental organizations and then started his own — Bloom Afghanistan — to bolster the country's private sector through consulting, microfinance and project evaluation.


He left with his family following the Taliban takeover in 2021 but continued working with his organization, returning in January 2022 to renew his business visa.


Despite having a valid visa, he was arrested by the Taliban in August 2022 after he returned to pay and train his staff, his lawyers said. A German and two Afghans with whom Corbett was arrested have since been released.


The U.N. expert said Corbett has developed several medical problems, including ringing in his ears, and severe weight loss. He has also repeatedly expressed intentions of suicide and self-harm.


The United States has had no diplomatic presence in Kabul since it fell to the Taliban in August 2021 as U.S. troops pulled out after 20 years of war.

## Blue Origin, SpaceX, United Launch Alliance picked to vie for Pentagon contracts

date: 2024-06-14, from: VOA News USA

washington — The U.S. Department of Defense picked Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, Elon Musk's SpaceX and Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA) to compete for national security space missions, making initial selections under a $5.6 billion award program. 


The Pentagon did not say which of the companies' rockets it selected but noted seven companies bid for entry into the program, which seeks rockets that must be ready to fly their first missions to space by December. 


The three companies are the first to be selected under the Pentagon's lucrative National Security Space Launch Phase 3 procurement program, a multibillion-dollar competition among U.S. rocket companies vying to launch some of the country's most sensitive military and intelligence satellites into space for roughly the next decade. 


SpaceX and ULA, two titans in the launch industry, have since 2020 been the Pentagon's primary rocket launch providers under a predecessor program, called Phase 2. That program gave ULA a 60% share of all Pentagon missions through 2027, with SpaceX getting the rest. 


But in the program's third phase, the Pentagon has sought a wider variety of companies for its space missions into the next decade, mainly to stimulate more competition in the U.S. launch sector. 


The announcement on Thursday brings Bezos' rocket launch and human spaceflight company Blue Origin into a competitive arena it has long wanted to enter as it tries to bring its giant New Glenn rocket to market and ramp up its competitive footing with SpaceX. 


SpaceX's partially reusable Falcon 9 rocket has dominated the launch industry while the company test launches its next-generation Starship rocket, a massive, fully reusable launch system that Musk sees as crucial to flying humans into space and launching large batches of satellites into orbit. 


While ULA's workhorse Atlas 5 rocket nears retirement, its next-generation Vulcan rocket is poised to become the company's centerpiece launcher. Vulcan first launched this year, and its second mission – a crucial step to receive certification for Pentagon missions – has been delayed but is expected to fly later this year. 


The three companies did not immediately reply to requests for comment about their rockets' role in the Pentagon program. 


The Pentagon's Phase 3 program is divided into two categories, Lane 1 and Lane 2. Lane 1, the category of Thursday's announcement, allows more novel or specialized rockets to fly national security missions that have less-stringent requirements. More companies, such as Rocket Lab, are expected to be added to Lane 1 in the coming years. 


The U.S. Space Force, which manages the launch procurement program, said Blue Origin received $5 million to provide an assessment of how it will meet the Pentagon's launch requirements. SpaceX and ULA – companies Space Force is more familiar with – each got $1.5 million. 


Lane 2, whose awards are expected in autumn, will tap three companies whose rockets are capable of meeting a wider variety of national security mission requirements, indicating the most experienced players such as SpaceX and ULA will be most fit for awards.

## Bootstrapping a Text Oriented Web

date: 2024-06-14, from: Robert's Ramblings

First order of business is to shorten "text oriented web" to TOW.  It's easier to type and say.  I'm considering the bootstrapping process from three vantage points.

1. content author
2. the server software
3. client software

The TOW approach is avoids invention in favor of reuse. HTTP protocol is well specified and proven. [Common Mark](https://commonmark.org) has a specification as does [YAML](https://yaml.org/). TOW documents are UTF-8 encoded. A TOW document is a composite of Common Mark with YAML blocks. TOW documents combined with HTTP provide a simplified hypertext platform.

TOW seeks to simplify the content author experience. TOW removes most of the complexity of content management systems rendering processes. A TOW document only needs to be place in a directory supported by a TOW server. In that way it is as simple as [Gopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)). The content author should only need to know [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), specifically the [Common Markdown](https://commonmark.org/) syntax. If they want to create interactive documents or distribute metadata about their documents they will need to be comfortable creating and managing YAML blocks embedded in their Common Mark document. Use of YAML blocks is already a common practice in the Markdown community.

Describing content forms using YAML has several advantages. First it is much easier to read than HTML source. YAML blocks are not typically rendered by Markdown processor libraries. I can write a simple preprocessor which tenders the YAML content form as HTML. Since HTML is allowed in Markdown documents these could then be run through a standard Markdown to HTML converter.  In the specific case of Pandoc a filter could be written to perform the pre-processor step. It should be possible to always render a TOW document as an HTML5 document. This is deliberate, it should be possible to use the TOW documents to extrapolate a traditional website. ...
