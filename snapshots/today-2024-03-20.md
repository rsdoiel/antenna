## West Eyes New Measures After Passage of Hong Kong Security Law

date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA

Taipei, Taiwan — Hong Kong’s adoption of a second national security law Tuesday is being criticized by foreign governments, while some business figures say the law will hasten foreign businesses’ departure from the city.


The United Nations, the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union expressed concern about the ambiguous language in the law and its speedy adoption, which was completed in less than two weeks.


U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk warned that the vague provisions in the bill, also known as Article 23, could lead to the criminalization of freedom of expression, freedom of peaceful assembly and the right to receive and impart information, which are all rights protected under international human rights law.


Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department said passage of Article 23 could accelerate the closing of a once-open society, adding that the U.S. is analyzing the potential impact of the law.


British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the law has failed to “provide certainty for international organizations, including diplomatic missions” operating in Hong Kong, and it will foster “the culture of self-censorship” that is now dominating the social and political landscape in the city.


Apart from reiterating concerns about the law’s potential impact on Hong Kong people’s basic rights and freedom, the EU said the bill’s increased penalties, extraterritorial reach and partial retroactive applicability are “also deeply worrying.”


Despite the international criticism, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee hailed the passage of Article 23 as “a historic moment for Hong Kong,” while the Chinese government expressed “full support” of the development.




Rights activists call for sanctions


While they welcome the concerns expressed by foreign governments, some human rights activists urged democratic countries to respond with more forceful measures.


“With the enactment of the Article 23 legislation, now is the time to impose sanctions on officials like Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee,” said Benedict Rogers, the CEO of U.K.-based nongovernmental organization Hong Kong Watch.


Since Hong Kong implemented the controversial national security law and detained dozens of pro-democracy activists and politicians in 2020, the U.S. is the only country that has imposed sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese officials, 24 of them in all.


Rogers said since the U.K. doesn’t want to damage trade relations with China, the British government remains reluctant to impose sanctions on Chinese officials over the deteriorating conditions in Hong Kong.


“[While] they imposed sanctions on some Chinese officials over the human rights violations in Xinjiang, they haven’t done anything similar on Hong Kong,” he told VOA by phone.


While the U.S. has introduced some tools to counter China’s tightening control over Hong Kong — including sanctions, new legislation to ban the export of certain items to Hong Kong and the elimination of Hong Kong’s special status — some observers urged Washington to roll out more forceful measures following the passage of the Article 23.


“There’s a lot that Congress and the administration can do, including issuing additional sanctions against people responsible for the implementation of the two national security laws and advancing other existing legislations related to Hong Kong,” Samuel Bickett, a Washington-based human rights activist, told VOA by phone.


In a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken Thursday, leaders of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China and the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party urged him to consider imposing new sanctions against officials responsible for undermining freedom and rule of law in Hong Kong.


They also vowed to advance the Hong Kong Economic Trade Office Certification Act and the Transnational Repression Policy Act through Congress. Once passed, the two bills would require Hong Kong to shut down its trade offices in the U.S. and allow the U.S. government to impose sanctions against Chinese or Hong Kong officials responsible for launching transnational repression against dissidents in the U.S. 




Laws’ effect on immigration, business


Apart from adopting more forceful measures against the Hong Kong and Chinese governments, Bickett and Rogers think democratic countries should introduce new immigration measures to accommodate the growing number of Hong Kong citizens leaving the city. According to statistics from Bloomberg, around 500,000 people have left Hong Kong since 2021.


While the U.K. has introduced an immigration program for holders of British Overseas Passports from Hong Kong, which was recently extended to more young people, Rogers hopes other countries, including the U.S. and those in Europe, can create similar programs tailored for Hong Kongers.


“I would like to see the EU and the U.S. offer some options so Hong Kongers who don’t qualify for the U.K.’s immigration scheme can have alternative options,” he said.


Since the Article 23 legislation uses vague language to define espionage and theft of state secrets, some analysts say foreign businesses may face serious challenges when conducting due diligence investigations or seeking information.


“This could be a big blow to banks and financial institutions, and it will further discourage investors from coming to Hong Kong since access to information is now further restricted,” Eric Lai, an expert on Hong Kong’s legal system at Georgetown Center for Asian Law, told VOA by phone.


Some analysts say the growing uncertainty in the business environment would lead more foreign businesses to consider leaving Hong Kong.


“Article 23 will hasten the departure of international businesses unless the Hong Kong government quickly establishes guard rails constricting the operational boundaries of the new law,” Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research, told VOA in a written response.

## Biden to Tout Government Investing $8.5 Billion in Intel's Computer Chip Plants in Four States

date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The Biden administration has reached an agreement to provide Intel with up to $8.5 billion in direct funding and $11 billion in loans for computer chip plants in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon. 


President Joe Biden plans to talk up the investment on Wednesday as he visits Intel's campus in Chandler, Arizona, which could be a decisive swing state in November’s election. He has often said that not enough voters know about his economic policies and suggested that more would support him if they did know. 


Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the deal reached through her department would put the United States in a position to produce 20% of the world's most advanced chips by 2030, up from the current level of zero. The United States designs advanced chips, but its inability to make them domestically has emerged as a national security and economic risk. 


“Failure is not an option — leading-edge chips are the core of our innovation system, especially when it comes to advances in artificial intelligence and our military systems,” Raimondo said on a call with reporters. “We can’t just design chips. We have to make them in America.”


The funding announcement comes amid the heat of the 2024 presidential campaign. Biden has been telling voters that his policies have led to a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing and job growth. His message is a direct challenge to former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, who raised tariffs while in the White House and wants to do so again on the promise of protecting U.S. factory jobs from China. 


Biden narrowly beat Trump in Arizona in 2020 by a margin of 49.4% to 49.1%. 


U.S. adults have dim views of Biden's economic leadership, with just 34% approving, according to a February poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs. The lingering impact of inflation hitting a four-decade high in 2022 has hurt the Democrat, who had a 52% approval on the economy in July 2021. 


Intel's projects would be funded in part through the bipartisan 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which the Biden administration helped shepherd through Congress at a time of concerns after the pandemic that the loss of access to chips made in Asia could plunge the U.S. economy into recession.  


When pushing for the investment, lawmakers expressed concern about efforts by China to control Taiwan, which accounts for more than 90% of advanced computer chip production. 


Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat up for reelection this year, stressed that his state would become "a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing” as Intel would be generating thousands of jobs. Ohio has voted for Trump in the past two presidential elections, and Brown in November will face Republican Bernie Moreno, a Trump-backed businessman from Cleveland. 


Wednesday's announcement is the fourth and largest so far under the chips law, with the government support expected to help enable Intel to make $100 billion in capital investments over five years. About 25% of that total would involve building and land, while roughly 70% would go to equipment, said Pat Gelsinger, CEO of Intel. 


“We think of this as a defining moment for the United States, the semiconductor industry and for Intel,” said Gelsinger, who called the CHIPS Act “the most critical industrial policy legislation since World War II.” 


The Intel CEO said on a call with reporters that he would like to see a sequel to the 2022 law in order to provide additional funding for the industry. 


Biden administration officials say that computer chip companies would not be investing domestically at their expected scale without the government support. Intel funding would lead to a combined 30,000 manufacturing and construction jobs. The company also plans to claim tax credits from the Treasury Department worth up to 25% on qualified investments. 


The Santa Clara, California-based company will use the funding in four different states. In Chandler, Arizona, the money will help to build two new chip plants and modernize an existing one. The funding will establish two advanced plants in New Albany, Ohio, which is just outside the state capital of Columbus. 


The company will also turn two of its plants in Rio Rancho, New Mexico into advanced packaging facilities. And Intel will also modernize facilities in Hillsboro, Oregon. 


The Biden administration has also made workforce training and access to affordable childcare a priority in agreements to support companies. Under the agreement with the Commerce Department, Intel will commit to local training programs as well as increase the reimbursement amount for its childcare program, among other efforts.

## Cheating Automatic Toll Booths by Obscuring License Plates

The Port Authority says officers in 2023 roughly doubled the number of summonses issued for obstructed, missing or fictitious license plates compared with the prior year.</p>
<p>Bramwell-Stewart said one driver from New Jersey repeatedly used what&#8217;s known in the streets as a flipper, which lets you remotely swap out a car&#8217;s real plate for a bogus one ahead of a toll area. In this instance, the bogus plate corresponded to an actual one registered to a woman who was mystified to receive the tolls. &#8220;Why do you keep billing me?&#8221; Bramwell-Stewart recalled her asking...</p></blockquote>

date: 2024-03-20, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> China&#8217;s foreign minister is making his first trip to Australia in seven years. Will the talks bring a bitter three-year trade war to an end? Plus, the Red Sea is used by 30% of the world&#8217;s container ships using the Suez Canal, but the journey is being made perilous by drone attacks from Houthi rebels in Yemen. We hear from one of the U.S. warships now patrolling the waters.</p>

	Earlier this month, the electric-car maker Rivian <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/rivian-suv-r2-r3-r3x" target="_blank">announced</a> its new SUV, the R2 — a $45,000 family hauler that will get more than 300 miles in range. It also debuted the R3 and R3X hatchbacks, which entranced online car nerds.
</p><p>
	These new Rivian models are sleek and important, but they won’t go on sale until 2026 at the earliest. Can Rivian last that long? We also chat about how electric vehicles’ physical requirements — big batteries, high voltage wires — are changing the design of cars themselves.

	Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
	<span></span>
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer:</strong> There’s this term called carcinization in evolutionary biology. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins:</strong> Ooh.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> People know this meme, which is that things in the sea tend to evolve into crabs. There’s lots of animals that look like crabs in the sea that are not true crabs, so to speak, because the crab is like a very successful bottom dweller form factor. And so animals that do not start as crabs, once they fill the same ecological niche as crabs, will wind up looking like crabs after you know 10 million, 15 million years.<br/><br/>
To remember another guy, I have been thinking also a lot of the — again, if you’re not driving, Google this — the 1990s Toyota Previa, which was a kind of, it was a minivan that was like a half oval. It was kind of pill shaped. And again, the wheels were right at the front and right at the back. It was a more successful car, you’ll see it, it was the iconic 90s Toyota minivan.
	<br/>
<br/>
	And I do feel like, to some degree, the whole car market is undergoing this process of carcinization, where what is actually the vehicle that people want the most, especially families want the most, is a minivan. But minivans are not seen as cool or rugged, and so the whole car market is like trying to generate a vehicle that is as close to the Previa as possible but does not look like a mini— You know, it’s not actually, but to some degree I feel like we keep evolving minivans again and again. 
	<br/>
<br/>
	If you think about the history of what the family car has been, where it was a station wagon in the 70s and 80s, then it was a minivan. Now it's this crossover SUV thing.
	<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah, because they make a lot of sense.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Those are, broadly, very similar cars. They’re very similar, right? They let you seat two to three kids and they give you a lot of space in the back. But as fashion changes and what's cool, we have to keep redesigning that form factor for just what’s trendy at the moment. But we’re just dancing around this common design.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah, it’s really interesting. There’s such a funny love hate relationship out there with minivans. I mean, they are  incredibly useful cars, right? But it’s so hard culturally. It’s so hard to be like, <em>Oh, I got a minivan, I gotta drive a minivan now</em>. I turned 40 this year, so I’m right there. I grew up—<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>You're closer to your midlife crisis than I am here.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> —in a household with, originally, when I was first born, they had two Volkswagen bugs. And then as we, my sister and I grew up and we needed more space, both my parents traded in their bugs for Volkswagen minibuses. So we had the Volkswagen bus. And it was like the best family car growing up, right? Because we could all camp in it. Like, you know, we could throw the back seat down and put a mattress there. One of us could sleep on the floor, the middle seats. All my friends would fit inside it for trips to the beach. You know, it was just a super useful vehicle. <br/>
<br/>
	And of course that, you know, that sort of design atrophied out  in terms of the mass market. People still buy them to convert for campers and things like that, like the Volkswagen California and other kinds of models like that in the van segment. But it’s interesting, the ID.4 Buzz is coming back to the market in the U.S. this year, as well. It’s the sort of rebirth of theVolkswagen microbus, and I'm really curious to see how it does because it’s a cool design. It’s a very retro forward, right? Which is very similar to how the R3 looks, I'd say. <br/>
<br/>
	I'll come back to that in a minute. But I’m really curious to see how it sells. I know my family’s been really interested in it, waiting for it to come out and see what it actually looks like in real life, and maybe test drive it and see if it’s something we might want in the future. But I would love to see more in that category, right? The van.<br/>
<br/>
	And you know, the SUV is really just trying to imitate a van with rugged looks that you really don't need. If you just admit it, you just want a minivan.<span></span>

## March 19, 2024

date: 2024-03-20, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

In Florida, Kansas, Ohio, Illinois, and Arizona, Republican voters chose their presidential candidate today. The results highlight the weaknesses former president Trump is bringing to the 2024 presidential contest. Trump, who is the only person still in the Republican race, won all five of today&#8217;s Republican races. But the results showed that his support is soft. Results are still coming in, but as I write this, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, who has suspended her campaign, received between 13% and 20% of the vote, Florida governor Ron DeSantis&#8212;who has also suspended his campaign&#8212;picked up votes, and &#8220;none of the names shown&#8221; got more than 5% in Kansas.

## How Texas' Plans to Arrest Migrants Would Work

date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA

McALLEN, Texas — A law that would allow Texas law enforcement to arrest migrants suspected of illegally entering the U.S. is back on hold.


The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals late Tuesday issued an order preventing its enforcement, just hours after the Supreme Court allowed the strict new immigration law to take effect.


The Justice Department is challenging the law, saying Texas is overstepping the federal government's immigration authority. Texas argues it has a right to take action over what the governor has described as an “invasion” of migrants on the border.


Here's what to know:


Who can be arrested? 


The law would allow any Texas law enforcement officer to arrest people suspected of entering the country illegally. Once in custody, migrants could either agree to a Texas judge’s order to leave the U.S. or be prosecuted on misdemeanor charges of illegal entry. Migrants who don’t leave could face arrest again under more serious felony charges.


Arresting officers must have probable cause, which could include witnessing the illegal entry or seeing it on video. 


The law cannot be enforced against people lawfully present in the U.S., including those who were granted asylum or who are enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.


Critics, including Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, fear the law could lead to racial profiling and family separation.


American Civil Liberties Union affiliates in Texas and some neighboring states issued a travel advisory a day after Gov. Greg Abbott signed the law. The advisory warns of a possible threat to civil and constitutional rights when passing through Texas. 


Abbott has rejected concerns over profiling. While signing the bill, he said troopers and National Guard members at the border can see migrants crossing illegally “with their own eyes.”


Where would the law be enforced? 


The law can be enforced in any of Texas' 254 counties, including those hundreds of miles from the border. 


But Republican state Rep. David Spiller, the law's author, has said he expects most arrests would occur within 80 kilometers of the U.S.-Mexico border. Texas' state police chief has expressed similar expectations.


Some places are off-limits. Arrests cannot be made in public and private schools, places of worship, or hospitals and other health care facilities, including those where sexual assault forensic examinations are conducted.


It is unclear where migrants ordered to leave might go. The law says they are to be sent to ports of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border, even if they are not Mexican citizens. However, Mexico’s government said Tuesday it would not accept the return of any migrants to its territory from the state of Texas.


Is the law constitutional? 


The Supreme Court's decision did not address the constitutionality of the law.

The Justice Department, legal experts and immigrant rights groups have said it is a clear conflict with the U.S. government’s authority to regulate immigration.


U.S. District Judge David Ezra, an appointee of former President Ronald Reagan, agreed in a 114-page order. He added that the law could hamper U.S. foreign relations and treaty obligations.


Opponents have called the measure the most dramatic attempt by a state to police immigration since a 2010 Arizona law — denounced by critics as the “Show Me Your Papers” bill — that was largely struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. Ezra cited the Supreme Court's 2012 Arizona ruling in his decision.


Texas has argued that the law mirrors federal law instead of conflicting with it. 


What is happening on the border? 


Arrests for illegal crossings along the southern border fell by half in January from record highs in December. Border Patrol officials attributed the shift to seasonal declines and heightened enforcement by the U.S. and its allies. The federal government has not yet released numbers for February.


Texas has charged thousands of migrants with trespassing on private property under a more limited operation that began in 2021.


Tensions remain between Texas and the Biden administration. In the border city of Eagle Pass, Texas, National Guard members have prevented Border Patrol agents from accessing a riverfront park.


Other Republican governors have expressed support for Abbott, who has said the federal government is not doing enough to enforce immigration laws. Other measures implemented by Texas include a floating barrier in the Rio Grande and razor wire along the border.

## China, Not Russia, Still Tops List of Threats to US

date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Russia’s war in Ukraine — portrayed by top U.S. officials as posing a danger to the United States itself — still trails China when it comes to long-term threats to America’s security, according to a top Pentagon official.


The warning from Ely Ratner, the Defense Department’s assistant secretary for Indo-Pacific security affairs, comes in testimony prepared for a hearing Wednesday by the House Armed Services Committee on security challenges in the Indo-Pacific region.


“The PRC [People’s Republic of China] continues to present the most comprehensive and serious challenge to our national security,” Ratner is set to tell lawmakers, according to a copy his opening statement obtained by VOA.


“The PRC remains the only country with the will and increasingly the capability to dominate the Indo-Pacific region and displace the United States,” Ratner warns, adding, “the PRC is pursuing its revisionist goals with increasingly coercive activities in the Taiwan Strait, the South and East China seas, along the Line of Actual Control with India, and beyond.”


This is not the first time Ratner has addressed the growing threat from Beijing.


In October he called out China’s military for what he described as a “sharp increase” in risky behavior in the East and South China seas.


Ratner also cautioned, separately, that China’s leaders were “increasingly turning to the PLA [People's Liberation Army] as an instrument of coercion.”




Additionally, the Pentagon’s annual China Military Power report said that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing faster than expected, while Beijing is building out the infrastructure needed for a further expansion of its nuclear forces.




China has responded to such allegations by accusing the U.S. of “hyping up” the threat.


On Tuesday, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin issued a warning of his own, emphasizing the threat from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.


"The United States stands by Ukraine because it's the right thing to do,” Austin told a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Ramstein, Germany. “But we also stand by Ukraine because it's crucial to our own security."


“The United States would face grave new perils in a world where aggression and autocracy are on the march and where tyrants are emboldened and where dictators think that they can wipe out democracy off the map," he said.


U.S. intelligence officials argued recently that the threats from Russia and China are linked, and that Russia’s war has served to embolden China's leadership.


Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told lawmakers earlier this month that Beijing has managed to get long-sought concessions from Moscow in exchange for support for Russia’s war in Ukraine.


And CIA Director William Burns said Russian success in Ukraine could “stoke the ambitions of the Chinese leadership in contingencies ranging from Taiwan to the South China Sea."




Ratner is set to tell U.S. lawmakers Wednesday that the Defense Department is working to strengthen key alliances in the Indo-Pacific and develop what he calls a “regional force posture” including Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Australia.


He is also set to testify that the Pentagon’s proposed 2025 budget is placing a priority on investments in air, sea and undersea power, as well as in modernizing U.S. nuclear forces with an eye toward Beijing’s own military modernization efforts.

## Biden, Trump Notch Wins; Other Races Offer Hints on National Politics

date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA

COLUMBUS, Ohio  — As Joe Biden and Donald Trump moved closer to a November rematch, primary voters around the country on Tuesday urged their favored candidate to keep up the fight and worried about what might happen if their side loses this fall.


There was little suspense about Tuesday's results as both candidates are already their parties' presumptive nominees. Trump easily won Republican primaries in Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Kansas and Ohio. Biden did the same except in Florida, where Democrats had canceled their primary and opted to award all 224 of their delegates to Biden.


Instead, the primaries and key downballot races became a reflection of the national political mood. With many Americans unenthusiastic about 2024's choice for the White House, both Biden and Trump's campaigns are working to fire up their bases by tearing into each other and warning of the perils of the opponent.


Those who did turn out to vote Tuesday seemed to hear that.


Pat Shackleford, an 84-year-old caregiver in Mesa, Arizona, said she voted for Trump in Arizona's primary to send the former president a message.


"I wanted to encourage him that the fight has been worthwhile, that more of us are behind him than maybe the media tells you," Shackleford said.


Jamie and Cassandra Neal, sisters who both live in Phoenix, said they were unenthusiastic Biden supporters until they saw the vigor the president brought to his State of the Union speech. It fired them up for the coming election.


"Beforehand it was like, 'Well, he's the only decent one there,'" said Cassandra Neal, 42. "After his address it was like, 'OK, let's do it!'"


Jamie Neal, 45, said Biden had been "way too nice" before and needed to match Trump, whom she described as "vicious."


"I hate to say it, sometimes you need to equal the lowness to get the person out," she said. "Sometimes you have to fight fire with fire."


In Ohio's Republican Senate primary, Trump-backed businessman Bernie Moreno defeated two challengers, Ohio Secretary of State Frank Frank LaRose and Matt Dolan, whose family owns the Cleveland Guardians baseball team.


Moreno and Trump appeared together Saturday at a rally where Trump praised his endorsed candidate as a "warrior" and ramped up his dark rhetoric, saying that were he not to be elected, "it's going to be a bloodbath for the country." His campaign insists he was referring to the auto industry and not the country as a whole.


In the final days of the campaign, The Associated Press reported on Thursday that in 2008, someone with access to Moreno's work email account created a profile on an adult website seeking "Men for 1-on-1 sex." The AP could not definitively confirm that it was created by Moreno himself. Moreno's lawyer said a former intern created the account and provided a statement from the intern, Dan Ricci, who said he created the account as "part of a juvenile prank."


Questions about the profile have circulated in GOP circles for the past month, sparking frustration among senior Republican operatives about Moreno's potential vulnerability in a general election, according to seven people who are directly familiar with conversations about how to address the matter. They requested anonymity to avoid running afoul of Trump and his allies.


Trump and Biden have for weeks been focused on the general election, aiming their campaigns lately on states that could be competitive in November rather than merely those holding primaries.


Trump, a Florida voter, cast his ballot at a recreation center in Palm Beach on Tuesday and told reporters, "I voted for Donald Trump."


Trump and Biden are running on their records in office and casting the other as a threat to America. Trump, 77, portrays the 81-year-old Biden as mentally unfit. The president has described his Republican rival as a threat to democracy after his attempt to overturn the 2020 election results and his praise of foreign strongmen.


Those themes were evident Tuesday at some polling locations.


"President Biden, I don't think he knows how to tie his shoes anymore," said Trump supporter Linda Bennet, a resident of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, not far from the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort.


Even as she echoed Trump's arguments about Biden, she criticized Trump's rhetoric and "the way he composes himself" as "not presidential at all." But she said the former president is "a man of his word," and she said the country, especially the economy, felt stronger to her under Trump's leadership.


In Columbus, Ohio, Democrat Brenda Woodfolk voted for Biden and shared the president's framing of the choice this fall.


"It's scary," she said of the prospect that Trump could be in the Oval Office again. "Trump wants to be a dictator, talking about making America white again and all this kind of crap. There's too much hate going on."


Bennet and Woodfolk agreed that immigration is one of their top concerns, though they offered different takes on why.


"This border thing is out of control," said Bennet, the Republican voter. "I think it's the government's plot or plan to bring these people in to change the whole dynamic for their benefit, so I'm pretty peeved."


Woodfolk, the Democrat, said she doesn't mind immigrants "sharing" opportunities in the U.S. but worried it comes at the expense of "people who've been here all their lives."


Trump and Republicans have hammered Biden on the influx of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in recent years, seeking to capitalize on the issue well beyond border states. Biden has ratcheted up a counteroffensive in recent weeks after Senate Republicans killed a migration compromise they had negotiated with the White House, withholding their support only after Trump said he opposed the deal. Biden has used the circumstances to argue that Trump and Republicans have no interest in solving the issue but instead want to inflame voters in an election year.


For the last year, Trump has coupled his campaign with his legal challenges, including dozens of criminal counts and civil cases in which he faces more than $500 million in fines.


His first criminal trial was scheduled to start Monday in New York on allegations he falsified business records to cover up hush money payments. But a judge delayed the trial for 30 days after the recent disclosure of new evidence that Trump's lawyers said they needed time to review.


Speaking outside his polling place with a voter's sticker affixed to his lapel, Trump insisted the cases against him were political and defended himself against criticism of his attacks a day earlier on Jewish Democrats, in which he alleged they hate Israel and their own religion. Democratic leaders on Tuesday criticized his comments as promoting antisemitic tropes about having divided loyalties.


Standing next to him was former first lady Melania Trump, who didn't have on a sticker. She has rarely appeared in public with Trump since he launched his third bid for the White House.


Asked if she would campaign with him, she replied: "Stay tuned."

## American Muslim Groups Plan to Boycott White House Ramadan

date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — American Muslims outraged by President Joe Biden's support of Israel say they will not take part in White House Ramadan and Eid celebrations this year as they continue to demand that the administration push for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza.


Should an invitation come, it's "widely understood" that American Muslim community leaders and organizations will decline, said Robert McCaw, director of the Government Affairs Department at the Council on American-Islamic Relations, CAIR.


"This decision is due to the administration's failure to address Muslim community demands for an immediate and permanent cease-fire," McCaw told VOA. "And its refusal to stop supplying manufactured weapons to Israel, which are being used in a genocide against our Palestinian brothers and sisters in Gaza."


Amid media reports that the administration is considering scaling back Ramadan events at the White House, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said no celebration related to the holy month has been announced.




"We understand that it is a painful time for a number of communities," she told VOA during her press briefing Monday. Senior White House officials have met with members of the Arab, Muslim and Palestinian communities "to talk about their views, to voice their concerns, and we welcome that," she added.


The suffering of the Palestinian people "will be front of mind for many" Muslims this Ramadan, President Joe Biden said in a statement marking the beginning of the month. "It is front of mind for me."


Since taking office, Biden has continued the decadeslong White House tradition of hosting Muslim community leaders that began with President Bill Clinton in 1996. Both Republican and Democratic presidents have hosted iftar dinner during Ramadan or an Eid al Fitr reception to mark the end of fasting after the month.


But this year, in addition to potentially facing the embarrassment of a massive boycott, the White House would likely want to avoid scenes where Biden is shouted at and heckled by pro-Palestinian protesters. Several of them have disrupted his campaign events around the country.


Outrage over Gaza is also affecting Nowruz, the Persian New Year celebrated by diaspora groups of varying ethnicity and religious affiliation from countries beyond Iran, including Iraq, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Turkey, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.


Nowruz this year overlaps with Ramadan. And instead of inviting hundreds of people to a reception as the administration has done in the past, this weekend the White House will be hosting a "Nowruz Open House tour."


"I'm not sure if the president himself would participate," said Jawaid Kotwal, board member of the Afghan American Foundation. "So it's way different. A watered-down, downgraded version of the typical Nowruz celebrations that we had in the White House."


Kotwal told VOA that he personally declined the invitation but his organization will "look for any avenue to continue to have engagement with any occupant of the White House."


The White House has not responded to requests for further details on its Nowruz or Ramadan plans.


In his statement marking Nowruz, Biden said the war has "inflicted terrible suffering on the Palestinian people," and vowed to "continue to lead international efforts to get more humanitarian assistance to them."


Clouded by controversy


This year is not the first time Ramadan at the White House is clouded with controversy. In his first year in office, President Donald Trump, who campaigned on banning Muslims from entering the United States and signed multiple executive orders restricting immigration from Muslim-majority countries, did not host a Ramadan event.


In 2018 and 2019, Trump welcomed diplomats from Muslim-majority nations to the White House for iftar, but American Muslim organizations and lawmakers were not on the guest list. At the time, American Muslim groups said they would have declined had they been invited.


Some American Muslims boycotted Biden's virtual Eid celebrations in May 2021 as hostilities escalated between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. More than 260 Palestinians were killed in that round of violence, according to the United Nations.


That death toll is a fraction of the more than 31,000 Palestinians killed since Israel launched its military campaign in response to the Hamas October 7 attacks that took at least 1,200 lives in Israel and more than 240 people hostage. The level of anger felt now by American Muslims, Arabs and wide swaths of Biden's Democratic base is also exponentially higher.


The community, including those who work in the administration, would feel "gaslit" by a White House Ramadan event this year, said Tariq Habash, a Palestinian American and former policy adviser at the Department of Education who resigned in protest in January.


"You can't in one hand try and show solidarity and understanding and then in the other hand supply an unrestricted amount of weapons and military funding to an extremist government that is intent on the indiscriminate bombing and killing of civilians," Habash told VOA.


The White House said it has actively engaged with Arab and Muslim Americans since the October 7 Hamas attack. Some in the community have refused to meet with administration officials.


Begum Ersoz, Farhad Pouladi, Anita Powell and Sayed Aziz Rahman contributed to this report.

## South Africa Accuses US Congress of Adding it to a New ‘Axis of Evil’ Over Israel Genocide Case

date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — South Africa seeks to limit the damage to its relations with Washington caused by its legal challenge to Israel’s assault on Gaza, a South African official said on Tuesday.


Naledi Pandor, who is South Africa's minister of international relations and cooperation, is in Washington seeking to sway members of the U.S. Congress from a proposed law that would further strain U.S. ties to Africa’s most vibrant democracy and a major mining, banking and manufacturing hub.


“I think there’s an attempt to take up punitive action against South Africa, this sort of axis of evil notion that’s very much part of the political culture,” Pandor said in response to a question from VOA at South Africa’s embassy in Washington.


In December, South Africa filed an application to institute proceedings against Israel at the United Nations’ top court. Pretoria argues that Israel’s actions in Gaza are “genocidal in character,” and aim to “destroy Palestinians in Gaza.”


In March, South Africa requested further measures from the International Court of Justice, accusing Israel of weaponizing starvation by preventing humanitarian aid from reaching the sealed-off exclave.


Israel’s government has denounced the case, and the White House told VOA in January it considers it “meritless.”


The case has since inspired a bipartisan push in the U.S. Congress for legislation mandating a full review of the bilateral relationship with South Africa. The draft bill, filed by Republican Representative John James and Democratic Representative Jared Moskowitz, claims that the actions of South Africa’s long-ruling African National Congress “are inconsistent with its publicly stated policy of nonalignment in international affairs.”


“South Africa has been building ties to countries and actors that undermine America’s national security and threaten our way of life through its military and political cooperation with China and Russia and its support of U.S.-designated terrorist organization Hamas,” James said in a statement when he introduced the bill in February. “We must examine our alliances and disentangle from those who remain willing to work with our adversaries.”


Pandor, who also met with think tanks and spoke publicly while in Washington, said she intended to remind members of Congress of the value of South Africa, on its own and as a gateway to the continent.


“We believe that any action to diminish the relationship would be most unwise,” she said, in response to another question from VOA. “Because these are two key democracies in the regions in which we exist.”


She said she believes the relationship between the United States and South Africa can help to promote peace and democracy on the African continent — and to support the agenda of development in Africa — “because I can't imagine how initiatives directed at greater trade and development would become operational if the institutional capacity of South Africa is not utilized.”


South Africa is also a major beneficiary of the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which offers duty-free U.S. market access to 32 African nations. Congress must vote on whether to extend the program beyond 2025.


VOA asked Pandor whether the high-stakes diplomatic pushback has been worth it.


“What I do know is if there's a struggle underway, the longer you take to address the demands of a struggle, the more violent and vicious the struggle becomes,” she replied. “So, the sooner you address peace and negotiations, the greater the opportunity for everybody to enjoy peace and security. This is the lesson of South Africa.”


And VOA asked analyst Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, if South Africa’s case had done anything to stop the conflict between Israel and Hamas.


“I don't think South Africa has reframed this conflict. I don't think South Africa has really changed the direction at this point,” he said. “But it's a thread that runs through it — this concern that South Africa has history which makes it especially sensitive to issues of discrimination and genocide. … It certainly added an element to conversation that wasn't there until South Africa pushed it as aggressively as it did.”


Pandor, a veteran member of the long-ruling African National Congress, stressed that Pretoria’s problem is not with the White House. She told VOA she had not sought meetings with President Joe Biden or Secretary of State Antony Blinken during her Washington visit.


“The executive understands [South Africa] far more than Congress,” she said.


When asked what she’d tell Biden, Pandor’s answer was short.


“Cease-fire,” she said. “Now.”

## How to write a QML effect for KWin

date: 2024-03-19, from: OS News

In order solve that problem, we started looking for some options and the most obvious one was QtQuick. It’s a quite powerful framework and it’s already used extensively in Plasma. So, in Plasma 5.24, we introduced basic support for implementing kwin effects written in QML and even added a new overview effect. Unfortunately, if you wanted to implement a QtQuick-based effect yourself, you would still have to write a bit of C++ glue yourself. This is not great because effects that use C++ are a distribution nightmare. They can’t be just uploaded to the KDE Store and then installed by clicking “Get New Effects…”. Furthermore, libkwin is a fast moving target with lots of ABI and API incompatible changes in every release. That’s not good if you’re an effect developer because it means you will need to invest a bit of time after every plasma release to port the effects to the new APIs or at least rebuild the effects to resolve ABI incompatibilities. This has been changed in Plasma 6.0. In Plasma 6, we’ve had the opportunity to address that pesky problem of requiring some C++ code and also improve the declarative effect API after learning some lessons while working on the overview and other effects. So, enough of history and let’s jump to the good stuff, shall we? ↫ Vlad Zahorodnii Making it easier to write things like Plasma widgets and Kwin effects is always desirable, and making them easier to distribute is only icing on the cake.

## Trump Urges US Supreme Court to Endorse 'Absolute Immunity' for Ex-Presidents

date: 2024-03-19, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Donald Trump’s legal team on Tuesday filed a U.S. Supreme Court brief in his bid for criminal immunity, arguing that a former president enjoys "absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for his official acts."


The case is to be argued before the justices on April 25.


Trump has appealed a lower court's rejection of his request to be shielded from the criminal case being pursued by Special Counsel Jack Smith because he was serving as president when he took the actions at the center of the case. Trump is charged with trying to overturn his 2020 election loss.


The filing advances arguments similar to ones Trump's lawyers previously have made and echoes statements he has made on the campaign trail as he seeks to regain the presidency.  


Trump, the first former president to be criminally prosecuted, is the Republican candidate challenging Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 U.S. election. Biden defeated Trump in 2020.


Smith was appointed by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022. In August 2023, Smith brought four federal criminal counts against Trump in the election subversion case, including conspiring to defraud the United States, obstructing the congressional certification of Biden's electoral victory and conspiring to do so, and conspiring against the right of Americans to vote.


In a filing to the justices in February, Smith sought to make the case against presidential immunity.


"The nation has a compelling interest in seeing the charges brought to trial," Smith said in the filing, adding that "the public interest in a prompt trial is at its zenith where, as here, a former president is charged with conspiring to subvert the electoral process so that he could remain in office."


The Supreme Court's decision to hear arguments on Trump's immunity bid next month postponed the trial, giving him a boost as he tries to delay prosecutions while running to regain the presidency. Trump has three other pending criminal cases. He has pleaded not guilty in all four cases, seeking to paint them as politically motivated.


Trump last October sought to have the charges dismissed based on his claim of immunity. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan rejected that claim in December.  


On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Feb. 6 ruled 3-0 against Trump's immunity claim, rejecting his bid for "unbounded authority to commit crimes that would neutralize the most fundamental check on executive power - the recognition and implementation of election results."


The case once again thrusts the nation's top judicial body, whose 6-3 conservative majority includes three justices appointed by Trump, into the election fray.


Trump and his allies made false claims that the 2020 election was stolen and devised a plan to use false electors to thwart congressional certification of Biden's victory. Trump also sought to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence not to allow certification to go forward. Trump's supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a bid to prevent the certification.


If Trump regains the presidency, he could seek to use his powers to force an end to the prosecution or potentially pardon himself for any federal crimes.

## John Romero doesn’t believe in prototypes

date: 2024-03-19, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>A couple weeks ago I joined <a href="https://social.lol/@tylersticka/112005607463887992">a conversation about John Romero and prototypes</a>. <a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/the-possibility-bridge/">Tyler posted some thoughts about Romero’s autobiography</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@matthiasott/112005791745972036">Matthias shared a quote from a Tim Ferris podcast</a> where Romero chided prototypes, and Matthias looped me in because I love prototypes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No prototypes. Just make the game. Polish as you go. Don’t depend on polish happening later. Always maintain constantly shippable code.<br />
– John Romero, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzqdZAYcwfY">Strange Loop 2002</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A quick internet conversation changed the course of my week a bit. After that short exchange I dove in and listened to podcasts, watched a handful of talks, and read an entire <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/doom-guy-life-in-first-person-john-romero/18230638?ean=9781419758119">autobiography</a>… and I’m still shocked that John Romero doesn’t believe in prototypes.</p>
<h2>id Software is synonymous with speed</h2>
<p>To understand Romero’s perspective you need to understand the ethos of id Software. id Software was –to borrow a gaming term– a “Press W” company, meaning they tend to plow through all obstacles to keep forward momentum. As Romero recounts in his biography, they prioritized speed above all other design principles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed in gameplay</li>
<li>Speed in development</li>
<li>Speed in using the latest tech</li>
<li>Speed in heavy metal MIDI soundtracks</li>
</ul>
<p>Romero and Carmack were also prolific developers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Romero#Games">Romero has over 100 titles to his name</a> and in 1991 they released 15 games! And they did this while simultaneously pioneering 3D video game graphics for Wolfenstein 3D (1992) and  DOOM (1993).  How did they maintain such velocity?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Good division of labor.</strong> Carmack worked on the game engine, Romero on the level design, and Tom Hall did the art.</li>
<li><strong>They lived together.</strong> I’m not advocating for workplace cohabitation, but I think you need to acknowledge the contextual environment.</li>
<li><strong>Knew the hardware.</strong> Carmack and Romero were intimately familiar with the limitations of the hardware they were developing against which made porting games to other platforms (Commodore, Amiga, etc) a lot more predictable.</li>
<li><strong>Always rewriting</strong>. They were always rewriting using the latest tech. Take an existing title and use the latest graphic capabilities, take an existing title and make it with the latest engine, rinse and repeat.</li>
<li><strong>Built internal tools.</strong> Romero built internal tools to speed up level design: <a href="https://keenwiki.shikadi.net/wiki/TED5">TEd</a> (a text-based level editor), <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/DoomEd">DoomEd</a>, and <a href="https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/QuakeEd">QuakeEd</a>. Romero frequently talks about making DOOM levels in a single night.</li>
<li><strong>Predictable scope.</strong> While the underlying graphics or physics engine might change dramatically, the formula for the scope of the game (number episodes, levels, weapons, and types of enemies) stayed nearly the same so you could repeat processes, reduce code churn, and avoid surprise hardware limitations.</li>
</ul>
<p>That formula gave the team a lot of shots on goal. To use another sports metaphor, that’s a lot of reps. id Software was crunch time all the time. Abiding in that  breakneck thrill ride enabled them to create groundbreaking, industry-defining titles like DOOM and Quake.</p>
<h2>Back to prototypes and the lack thereof…</h2>
<p>Okay. Back to the main plot. John Romero doesn’t like prototypes…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“No prototypes. Just make the game. Polish as you go.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speed is great, but process effects outcomes. In Romero’s own words “Don’t depend on polish happening later” which is something those of us in tech know all too well. You’re probably going to run up against “<a href="https://devopedia.org/iron-triangle">the Iron Triangle</a>” at some point.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to throw shade – I will never be as successful as id Software – but here’s a side-by-side of two similar side-scroller games.</p>
<figure>
<div class="gallery" style="display:grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: var(--fluid-pad, 1.5vw); max-width: 640px;">
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/mario.png" alt="Super Mario Bros (1985)">
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/keen.png" alt="Commander Keen (1990)">
</div>
</figure>
<p>One is a game from a company that prioritizes prototyping and using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpei_Yokoi#Lateral_Thinking_with_Withered_Technology">withered technology</a> (Super Mario Bros, 1985), the other is a clone of that game from a company that prioritizes shipping quick on the latest hardware (Commander Keen, 1990). This isn’t an attempt to strip the game of its technical achievements, bringing Nintendo-like games to the PC, but there’s a palpable difference between the two; one is timeless and one is timely. While a myriad of skill, staffing, and technology factors contribute to the difference<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>, I believe the biggest delta comes down to pressing the publish button too early.</p>
<p>There’s a <a href="https://www.acriticalhit.com/solved-miyamoto-quote-late-game-bad-forever">famously misattributed</a> quote that seems apropos here…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A delayed game is eventually good. A bad game is bad forever.”<br />
– Siobahn Beeman, often misattributed to Shigeru Miyamoto</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who cares if some “<a href="https://arc.net/l/quote/brzalrzi">not spectacular</a>” graphics slipped out the door? That game, Commander Keen, was successful. id Software was successful. Over and over. From my perspective that comes down to the sheer volume of ideas they shipped, that continuous practice, and their novel shareware distribution model coinciding with the explosion of the internet and the PC. You need to be responsive and reactive to that wave and if there’s a commitment to release a new product every month, then I wouldn’t recommend a thinking tool like prototypes under those limitations either.</p>
<p>Do I –without evidence– believe they actually did prototype a bit? Yes. I think in the sense of experimenting with level design or evaluating community mods, they could cheaply explore new ideas with low effort thanks to their level editor tools. All those throwaway ideas amount to some level of what I’d call prototyping. But I take Romero’s point that they didn’t believe in prototyping, they were working on the product, not an idea, and could have hit publish at any point in the process.</p>
<p>So I’ll concede that maybe with a pair of once-in-a-generation talent, a perfect mixture of group workaholism, a breakneck cadence, all living in the same house, a convergence of new technologies, quality internal tools, the explosion of the home computer industry, an original and extremely violent IP that appealed to the Metallica generation, and over a hundred shots on goal… you too might be able to capture lightning in a bottle and create a smash hit like “the entire concept of 3D video games”…</p>
<p>… but for the rest of us there’s prototypes.</p>

In the years since the IRA’s passage, Republicans have <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/2024-election-climate-trump" target="_self">become savvier</a> in their attacks on climate change, honing their rhetoric and misinformation about EVs, the energy transition, and climate science more broadly. The Heritage Foundation even published an extensive playbook for how, exactly, Trump should <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self">dismantle most of the progress on the green transition</a>.
</p><p>
	The stakes are consequential, to say the least: One recent estimate by <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-trump-election-win-could-add-4bn-tonnes-to-us-emissions-by-2030/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CarbonBrief</a> found that a Trump reelection would add an extra 4 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030 compared to a Biden reelection. That is enough to “negate – twice over – all of the savings from deploying wind, solar, and other clean technologies around the world over the past five years,” the report said.
</p><p>
	With the climate agenda on the line, Heatmap is keeping a running list of Trump’s climate-related statements on the campaign trail. We’ve looked at his rallies, TV appearances, and social media comments, and compiled a list of his most frequent and <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-ev-charging" target="_blank">glaringly inaccurate</a> claims since he vacated the White House in January 2021.
</p><p>If you’re looking for just the new stuff — on whether infrastructure for charging electric vehicles will <a href="#3-trillion">bankrupt</a> the U.S. economy (spoiler alert: it won’t), on whether we’re sending “<a href="#tar">tar</a>” up into the atmosphere (nope), and that infamous <a href="#bloodbath">bloodbath</a> comment (actually about EVs) — you can find those via these helpful links.</p><p>
	While some of his musings (okay, fine, a lot of them) might be laughably absurd, others might be something you’ve wondered about yourself. To help you better separate fact from fiction, we’ve added context and explanation to each quote, along with a bottom-line determination of the remark’s facticity.
</p><p>
	Lastly, this list is a work in progress and will be regularly updated and added to in the coming months, so if you’re ever in doubt, know that you can find the answer somewhere in here. For ease of navigation, we’ve broken things down into sections:

</blockquote><p>
<strong>Fact check: </strong>Trump’s mumbling about “clime” at a New Hampshire rally resulted in speculation about his <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-struggles-word-climate-reveals-190511795.html#:~:text=At%20a%20New%20Hampshire%20campaign,supporters%20at%20the%20Saturday%20event." target="_blank">mental</a> well-being — as well as <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/stephen-colbert-trump-climate-gaffe-b2483334.html" target="_blank">a late-night bit by Stephen Colbert</a>. While <strong>it’s unclear exactly what Trump was going on about</strong>, we <em>can</em> get a few things straight:
</p><ul>
<li>“Clime” is usually used as a geographic term to refer to a <em>particular</em> region’s climate. As in, “<em>We left New York for the warmer climes of Florida.” </em>The Oxford Learner’s Dictionary says its use is usually “literary or humorous.”</li>
<br/>
<li>“Climate” refers to weather patterns in a given area, taken as a whole. “When scientists talk about climate, they’re often looking at averages of precipitation, temperature, humidity, sunshine, wind, and other measures of weather that occur over a long period in a particular place,” <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/weather-vs-climate" target="_blank">NOAA explains</a>. (A 30-year window is pretty typical when speaking about a place’s climate.)</li>
</ul><p>
	And just for good measure, “weather” differs from “climate” or “clime” in that it refers to short-term meteorological events in a specific place. So while the 
	<em>weather</em> on a given day, week, or month can be unseasonably cold, the overall <em>climate</em> can still be warming.
</p><blockquote>
<em>“You know they don’t call it global warming so much now, they call it climate change because it wasn’t working … Global warming wasn’t working when it was cooling. So now they call it climate change, that takes care of everything.”</em> [<a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1732231225895432458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1732231225895432458%7Ctwgr%5E382b4d715f43b24d62c3fe54ba69a436836e41a6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-35245541441656720993.ampproject.net%2F2312012346000%2Fframe.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dec. 5, 2023</a>]

<strong>Fact check: </strong>The term “climate change” was initially popularized by Republicans. In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/02/us/a-call-for-softer-greener-language.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2002 memo</a>, Republican pollster Frank Luntz urged President George W. Bush to drop the phrase “global warming” in favor of “climate change” since the former sounds more “frightening” and “has catastrophic communications attached to it,” while “climate change sounds a more controllable and less emotional challenge.”
</p><p>
	That said, 
	<strong>scientists generally prefer the term “climate change”</strong> for pretty much exactly the reason Trump highlighted here — because it encompasses phenomena caused by the increase in CO2 in our atmosphere that don’t manifest as warming, like ocean acidification. For the record: Global warming doesn’t mean that the weather will <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/east-west-flood-blizzard-storm" target="_self">never get cold</a>, just that it will get <em>less</em> cold on average, over time. In fact, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00498-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research</a> shows that the cold parts of the globe are warming much, much faster than the rest.

<strong>Fact check</strong><strong>: That’s … true, actually.</strong> “When the atmosphere warms, that means it can hold more water,” Matthew Rodell, the deputy director of Earth sciences for hydrosphere, biosphere, and geophysics at NASA, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/03/14/climate/extreme-weather-climate-change.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who has made an extensive study of extreme drought and deluges</a>, told me. That means there will be both more droughts <em>and </em>more rainfall, even though the two phenomena might appear at a glance to contradict each other.
</p><p>
	“On the drought side of things, when the air is warmer, more water can evaporate — can be pulled out of the land and out of the plants, into the air, and then transported away,” Rodell explained. “So you have, basically, more water being net removed from an area.” But water in the air has to return to Earth, eventually, in the form of more — and often extreme — rainfall.
</p><p>
	Shouldn’t those two extremes effectively balance each other out? As Rodell put it to me, “Floods and droughts are both catastrophes.” During a drought, crops die and wells go dry. And while extreme rainfall might refill an aquifer, “if it’s at the point of being extreme and there’s a flood, 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/libya-floods-storm-daniel-derna" target="_self">that’s not good, either</a>.” Think about Libya, where extended heavy rains in the summer of 2023 broke through dams and inundated towns, killing 4,300 people, displacing an estimated 44,800 more, and causing <a href="https://www.trtafrika.com/africa/libya-allocates-dollar446m-for-post-flood-repairs-14939356" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">over $60 million in damage</a>.
</p><p>
	One last thing to mention here: While our ability to determine the precise contribution of climate change to individual extreme weather events is improving rapidly, that is, in some ways, beside the point. Rodell explained that “in terms of the frequency, and looking at all these events together and how they’ve changed over time, we’re seeing that they’re increasing in number and severity in correlation with global warming. That doesn’t mean you can say any particular event is 100% by global warming, but, I mean — statistically, it’s 
	<em>extremely unlikely</em> that this is just a coincidence.”

<strong>Fact check: While it’s true that the climate has always changed, it hasn’t always changed like <em>this</em>.</strong> The rapid rise in both atmospheric carbon dioxide <em>and </em>observed average surface temperature since the Industrial Revolution can only be credited to humans, and specifically to the burning of fossil fuels, which release CO2, a heat-trapping gas. There is now near-universal<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> scientific consensus</a> that the warming we’re witnessing has been caused by human activity.
</p><p>
	“The most popular climate myths are the ones that are simple and easy to say,” as John Cook, a senior research fellow at Melbourne University’s School of Psychological Sciences who’s made a 
	<a href="https://youtu.be/JuUz2AwoSko?list=PL1xbdG-NAkB1fAyNAWErM4uEXyduldiew&t=750" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">specialty</a> of <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aaa49f" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">combatting</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/H5kejSYPD7U" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">climate disinformation</a>, told me. “It’s the single-cause fallacy, thinking that only one thing can cause natural causes. But you can have other things like human activity that also drive climate change,” Cook added.
</p><p>
	Start digging into this kind of logic and it quickly falls apart. For example, Trump’s argument is that the climate has changed naturally in the past; therefore, it must be changing naturally now, as well. But, Cook told me, the same logic could also be used to argue, 
	<em>People have died of cancer in the past; therefore, cigarettes don’t cause cancer now</em>.

<strong>Fact check:</strong> For starters, <strong>Trump’s numbers are orders of magnitude off the mark. </strong>The oceans are on track to rise <em>3.5 feet to 7 feet</em> along America’s coastlines by 2100 — well ahead of Trump’s schedule — according to <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/hazards/sealevelrise/sealevelrise-tech-report.html#:~:text=About%202%20feet%20(0.6%20meters,the%20end%20of%20this%20century." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an independent assessment</a> conducted by federal scientific agencies.

	According to the

</p><p>
	While unlikely, 49 feet of sea-level rise would be catastrophic. Large swaths of lower Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens would be completely submerged, with waves lapping at the walls of Yankee Stadium and Citi Field. The southern half of Florida would vanish (bye-bye, Mar-a-Lago!). Countries like the Netherlands and Bangladesh would, literally, disappear from the map.

</p><p>
	What about the bad air flowing to us “from Asia,” then? This isn’t total nonsense. For one thing, we

</blockquote><p>
<strong>Fact check:</strong> If you ever want to feel ridiculous, try asking a scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration if windmills are making whales “a little batty.”
</p><p>
	NOAA actively studies how “sound, vessel, and other human activities” impact marine life, Lauren Gaches, the director of NOAA Fisheries Public Affairs, told me over email. “At this point, 
	<strong>there is no scientific evidence that noise resulting from offshore wind site characterization surveys could potentially cause mortality of whales</strong>,” she said.
</p><p>
	An ongoing “unusual mortality event” for humpback whales has resulted in 200 whale deaths between 2016 and June 2023 along the Atlantic coast from Maine to Florida — that much is true. But “there are no known links between recent large whale mortalities and ongoing offshore wind surveys,” Gaches told me. 
	<a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/marine-life-distress/frequent-questions-offshore-wind-and-whales" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NOAA’s fact page</a> on whales and offshore wind explains that of “roughly 90 whales examined, about 40% had evidence of human interaction, either ship strike or entanglement.”
</p><p>
	There has been some chatter about underwater surveying work disrupting whales, which 
	<a href="https://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/mar/mcbem-2014-01/other/mcbem-2014-01-submission-seismic-airgun-en.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">may be true</a> in the case of oil and gas surveys, which use seismic air guns to penetrate deep into the ocean floor. The surveying equipment used for offshore wind is, by contrast, used in 15-second bursts and limited to a specific area, “so the likelihood of an animal encountering and coming right into that sound beam is quite low,” Erica Staaterman, the deputy director for the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s Center for Marine Acoustics, said on <a href="https://noaa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/Transcript-011823-NOAA-Fisheries-Media-Teleconference-East-Coast-whale-strandings-508.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a NOAA-hosted call with the press</a> early last year.
</p><p>
	As Ben Laws, the deputy chief of NOAA’s Permits and Conservation Division in the Office of Protected Resources, said on the same call, “There is no information that would support any suggestion that any of the equipment that’s being used in support of wind development for these site characterization surveys could directly lead to the death of a whale.”

</p><p>
	Lewis Grove is the director of wind and energy policy at the American Bird Conservancy, and he told me that while it’s “not necessarily as simple as Mr. Trump painted it out to be, 
	<strong>wind turbines absolutely kill birds</strong>.”
</p><p>
	But the context here is extremely important. Jason Ryan, a spokesperson for the American Clean Power Association, a leading renewable energy trade group, pointed me to research from the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service that shows wind farms “represent just 
	<a href="https://www.fws.gov/library/collections/threats-birds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">0.03% of all human-related bird deaths in the U.S.</a>” Grove likewise told me that, for the most part, bird deaths due to wind turbines do “not have population-level impacts.”
</p><p>
	There are exceptions, such as an infamous wind farm in California’s Altamont Pass built in 1981 that “just happened to be in a place that was really heavily used by golden eagles,” Grove told me. Because golden eagle populations were already very low, having 
	<a href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/protecting_birds_of_prey_at_altamont_pass/pdfs/factsheet.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">100 or so</a> killed a year by turbines was “unsustainable.” Even in a case like this, though, it behooves one to look at the whole picture: “They found it was a few individual turbines that were causing the damage,” Grove said. These days, around 60 golden eagles a year are killed in Alameda County, <a href="https://alamedapost.com/features/alameda-life/making-wind-energy-safer-for-golden-eagles/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the<em> Alameda Post</em> reports</a>, and the operating company must pay steep penalties for eagle deaths.
</p><p>
	What’s more, “climate change is one of the greatest threats birds face, with 
	<a href="https://www.audubon.org/climate/survivalbydegrees" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two-thirds of North American species</a> at risk of extinction due to our warming planet,” Jon Belak, senior manager of science and data analysis at The National Audubon Society, told me in a statement. “We need to build more wind and solar facilities to help slow the rise in global temperatures and protect birds and their habitats from a changing climate.”
</p><p>
	Wind farms may not have population-level impacts on birds, but fracking does — “the onset of shale oil and gas production reduces subsequent bird population counts by 15%,” even after accounting for factors like weather and other land-use changes, according to one just-published, peer-reviewed study.

<strong>Fact check:</strong> “I mean, <strong>it’s possible with any mix of generation that if supply and demand aren’t equal, your TV will go out</strong>. That’s just physics,” Kyri Baker, an assistant professor of engineering at the University of Colorado, told me when I asked her if Trump’s scenario had any merit. In other words, a power outage could happen whether your electricity is coming from coal or natural gas or anything else. The difference, she said, is that “wind is by nature variable, intermittent. But it’s also not reliant on fuel like natural gas or coal plants or even nuclear plants are.”
</p><p>
	What happens on days when there is no wind? “Grids are extremely regulated,” Baker explained to me. “There’s so many layers of redundancy that aim 
	<em>specifically</em> to not have [an outage] happen.” A grid is made up of diverse electricity sources (for my visual learners, <em>Canary</em> imagines what a net-zero grid could look like <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/chart-what-will-a-net-zero-grid-energy-mix-actually-look-like" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>), as well as measures like offline backup generators, which can kick in if need be, so service isn’t disrupted.
</p><p>
	Battery storage is another huge part of this equation. While they’re still fairly cutting-edge as climate technology goes, high-capacity batteries that can manage grid-scale energy needs are getting 
	<a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/in-boost-for-renewables-grid-scale-battery-storage-is-on-the-rise" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">better</a> and <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/news/2023-10/california-sees-unprecedented-growth-energy-storage-key-component-states-clean" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more plentiful</a>.

<strong>Fact check: Wind turbines do not damage the literal atmosphere.</strong>
</p><p>
	But maybe Trump meant atmosphere as in “sense of place”? Most Americans don’t seem to think windmills are “ruining” anything. In 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/change-polling-concern-belief-republicans-vs-democrats" target="_self">a recent Heatmap poll</a>, nearly eight in 10 Americans said they want the government to make it <em>easier</em> to build new wind farms. <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2023/10/03/solar-panels-wind-turbines-nimby/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">similarly found last year</a> that about 70% of Americans said they wouldn’t mind living near a wind farm.
</p><p>
	As my colleague Robinson Meyer 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/renewables-nimby-poll-solar-wind" target="_self">has written</a>, “American laws today give even a small, well-resourced minority plenty of tools to block a project” like a wind farm, and “what’s more, once that small group starts campaigning against a project, the public’s broad but shallow support for, say, a general technology can crater. That’s what happened recently in New Jersey, where a once broadly pro-wind public <a href="https://stockton.edu/news/2023/windmill-support-drops-hughes-poll.html#:~:text=In%202019%2C%2080%25%20of%20adult,today%20by%20the%20William%20J." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has turned against</a> four proposed offshore wind farms.”

<strong>Fact check: Wind in general is not the most expensive form of energy, but <em>offshore</em> wind is very expensive — for now.</strong>
</p><p>
	Of the energy sources we’re currently used to, nuclear is usually cited as having the highest levelized cost of electricity — that is, it has the highest average cost per unit of electricity generated after construction, maintenance, and operation have been taken into account. Peaker plants — gas-powered plants that run just during times of peak demand — usually come in second.
</p><p>
<a href="https://decarbonization.visualcapitalist.com/the-cheapest-sources-of-electricity-in-the-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Offshore wind <em>is </em>costly</a>, with the levelized cost of electricity from a subsidized U.S. offshore wind project increasing “to $114.20 per megawatt-hour in 2023, up almost 50% from 2021 levels in nominal terms,” <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/soaring-costs-stress-us-offshore-wind-companies-ruin-margins/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BloombergNEF reports</a>. Many of the factors making offshore wind so expensive — including <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/permitting-reform-transmission-nepa-geothermal" target="_self">permitting delays</a>, <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/high-interest-rates-clean-energy" target="_self">high interest rates</a>, and <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/everyones-mad-at-offshore-wind-developers" target="_self">supply chain issues</a> — will abate with time. Meanwhile, onshore wind is one of the <em>cheapest</em> forms of electricity available and has boasted a “lower LCOE than gas plants since 2015,” Sustainable Energy in America <a href="https://decarbonization.visualcapitalist.com/the-cheapest-sources-of-electricity-in-the-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a>.

<strong>Fact check:</strong> “That question is actually a little bit tricky,” Baker, the assistant professor of engineering at the University of Colorado, told me, when I asked him whether solar alone could power a factory — but <strong>it’s also not really what we should be asking</strong>. “One thing I’ve noticed people do a lot is they’ll just compare efficiency of power generation,” Baker explained. But “it’s not just about the efficiency — it’s about other things, too, like solar’s ability to be distributed. You can’t put a nuclear fission power plant in your house — you know, not yet — but you <em>can</em> put solar panels, so that’s a huge benefit. It offers some resiliency that other sources just can’t offer.”
</p><p>
	It’s true that solar power 
	<em>is</em> less efficient than other sources of energy, including wind, and that it requires a lot of surface area, which could be an undue burden for a manufacturer. But at the same time, “I don’t know if anybody is proposing to power an entire factory based off of solar,” Baker said.

<strong>Fact check: It’s not wrong to say that Biden has tried to reduce the role of liquid fuel in vehicles.</strong> Trump has gunned for Iowa voters by claiming Biden’s goal (albeit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/28/us/politics/trump-fact-check-electric-vehicles.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not a binding mandate</a>) of ramping up EV sales will kill the local ethanol industry. But Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack — Iowa’s former governor — has stressed that just because the administration is pushing for more EVs, “Does that mean we won’t have a need for E15 or E85” — gasoline blends that contain up to 15% and 85% ethanol content, respectively — “in the future? No.”
</p><p>
	For example, new rules defining what qualifies as a “sustainable aviation fuel” — and thus for generous tax credits under the IRA — include ethanol and other plant-based fuels, despite

<strong>Fact check:</strong> Trump has repeatedly slammed the Biden administration for supposedly wanting to switch to “all-electric” tanks. <strong>This is mostly false</strong>, though it has its roots in the Army’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2022/02/10/army-military-green-climate-strategy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first-ever climate strategy</a>, released early last year. In it, the Army stated that it aims to electrify all noncombat vehicles by 2035 and some tactical vehicles by 2050.
</p><p>
	The reason the Army wants to go electric isn’t because of some woke environmentalist agenda, though. “The primary reason the Army wants to electrify its fighting vehicles is to reduce wartime casualties,” 
	<a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/us-armys-electric-tanks-on-hold-as-battery-technology-develops" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Bloomberg</em> writes</a>. “An all-electric fleet would mean personnel wouldn’t have to go on dangerous refueling missions that draw combat forces away from fighting the enemy … [and] electric vehicles are also much quieter and harder to spot on enemy surveillance systems because they generate so little heat.”
</p><p>

</blockquote><p>
<strong>Fact check: This is wrong in a number of ways.</strong> Let’s take it from the top: First, Biden did not block the export of liquified natural gas to other countries; he temporarily paused the approval of new licenses to export LNG, including 17 that had been in the, er, pipeline. The United States is already the top exporter of LNG in the world, with output expected to double by the end of the decade from projects that are already licensed and under construction. The LNG licensing pause “will not impact our ability to continue supplying LNG to our allies in the near-term,” the Biden administration has said; current exports have been more than enough to meet Europe’s needs so far, even accounting for the war in Ukraine.
</p><p>
The permitting process will resume once the Department of Energy has updated its criteria for determining whether new LNG export terminals are in the “public interest” once their climate impacts are considered.
</p><p>
Now, about those climate impacts: It’s true that natural gas burns “cleaner” than coal, producing about 40% less carbon dioxide (and about 30% less than oil). But natural gas is also largely composed of methane, “a climate-altering super pollutant,” Jeremy Symons, an environmental and political analyst and strategist, told Heatmap.
</p><p>
While methane breaks down more quickly in the atmosphere than CO2, it also traps more heat — about 80 times more heat over the course of 20 years. The process of liquifying natural gas not only requires additional energy, it also introduces new opportunities for methane to leak, adding to the fuel’s climate impacts. Once all those leaks have been quantified, argues Cornell University researcher Robert Howarth, LNG is not only not beneficial to the environment, it’s actually worse than other fossil fuels. Howarth’s paper has not yet been peer-reviewed, and some have questioned his conclusions in the past. But there’s no question that building new LNG facilities will lock the U.S. into producing planet-warming fuel for years to come.
</p><p>
LNG certainly isn’t “good for the environment” of the people who live near fracking sites and export terminals, either, where health issues are rampant. In addition to methane, LNG plants release volatile organic compounds, which have been linked to higher instances of cancer, asthma, and birth defects.

</blockquote><p>
<strong>Fact check: </strong>Trump made these remarks after winning the New Hampshire primary — and <strong>t</strong><strong>hey’re wrong</strong>. For one thing, while energy <em>is</em> expensive in the Granite State, New Hampshire’s Department of Energy says its energy costs are <a href="https://www.energy.nh.gov/energy-information/energy-new-hampshire" target="_blank">the fifth-highest</a> in the lower 48.
</p><p>
	There’s an even bigger fallacy in Trump’s statement, though: that drilling can quickly lower energy prices. For one thing, oil from new leases 
	<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/5-reasons-why-the-united-states-cant-drill-its-way-to-energy-independence/" target="_blank">doesn’t hit the market</a> for at least four years, according to the Government Accountability Office. (Offshore drilling takes even longer since building the rigs alone can take two to three years.) As <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/19/1086925726/gas-prices-oil-crude-drilling" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NPR explains</a>, there are also operational limits; drilling new wells is “not as simple as turning a spigot and watching oil gush out.”
</p><p>
	Much to the dismay of environmentalists, the Biden administration has also been 
	<a href="#drill">keeping pace</a> with Trump’s historic drilling. In fact, as of 2024, the U.S. is producing more domestic crude than <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=MCRFPUS2&f=M" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at any point during Trump’s presidency</a>.
</p><p>
	But even with all this new domestic crude, the U.S. is still susceptible to fluctuations in the global price of oil. That’s partially because the U.S. imports a different kind of oil than it exports — what those in the trade call light, sweet crude, compared to the gunkier, heavy crude most U.S. refineries are set up for. Reconfiguring refineries to handle the light crude oil “could underserve some product markets and idle (or even strand) the hundreds of billions of dollars invested in refinery conversion capacity,” the American Petroleum Institute 
	<a href="https://www.api.org/news-policy-and-issues/blog/2018/06/14/why-the-us-must-import-and-export-oil" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warns</a>. Plus, it would also take even more time.
</p><p>
	All that means that the U.S. is stuck relying on importing and exporting oil 
	<em>even if </em>domestic production ramps up even more than it already has. And that, in turn, means we’re at the mercy of fluctuations in global energy costs, which remain out of the White House’s singular control.
</p><p>
	One more thing to note: “The oil industry can decide to produce more oil whenever it wants,” the Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy think tank, 
	<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/5-reasons-why-the-united-states-cant-drill-its-way-to-energy-independence/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explains</a>, noting that the oil industry is sitting on “<a href="https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/docs/2022-02/FY%202022%20APD%20Status%20Report%20December.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 9,000</a> approved — but unused — drilling permits on federal lands.” This is the base of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/oil-companies-record-profits-2022-exxon-chevron/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the criticism</a> that the oil industry is raking in “unprecedented profits” and burdening Americans with an artificially high cost of energy.

<strong>Fact check:</strong> As someone who lives in a New York City apartment, I would absolutely describe my dishwasher as “precious and dear,” so that part is true. It is also true that, <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/dishwashers-biden-conservatives-culture-war" target="_self">as I explained last year</a>, rules proposed by the Biden administration call for new dishwashers imported and made in the U.S. to use 34% less water, or no more than 3.3 gallons, during their default cycles by 2027. But <strong>it is not true that those dishwashers don’t work</strong>.
</p><p>
	Energy-efficient dishwashers 
	<em>can </em>take a long time to clean your dishes; many cycles last more than two hours and some up to three. The reason for this is pretty straightforward: In order to achieve the same level of cleanliness as old, water- and energy-inefficient dishwashers, new water- and energy-efficient dishwashers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyOHcNcovYA&ab_channel=ApplianceVideo.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">need to swish around longer</a>.
</p><p>
	But the “default cycles” are the 
	<em>only</em> dishwasher mode the government restricts; “short cycle” modes, which require more water and take less time, are still allowed on dishwashers sold in the U.S. and aren’t regulated by the new rules. That fast mode just can’t be the default. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/dishwashers-trump-efficiency/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">As <em>Wirecutter</em> writes</a>, “crappy cleaning performance and long cycles aren’t an inevitable outcome of efficiency standards,” and “if your dishwasher is slow and sucks (and a better detergent doesn’t fix the problem), blame the company that built it.”

<strong>Fact check: It’s really gas furnace systems that are, technically speaking, dated.</strong> Gas furnaces were considered <a href="https://cycleairfilters.com/blogs/all-about-hvac/history-of-the-forced-air-gas-furnace#:~:text=In%20the%201920s%20and%201930s,for%20their%20efficiency%20and%20reliability." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state-of-the-art</a> in the 1920s and 1930s, while heat pump technology — which works by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQaycSD5GWE&ab_channel=BCHydro" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">transferring</a>, rather than generating, heat from indoors to outdoors and vice versa — <a href="https://texascooppower.com/heat-pumps-are-back-and-worth-a-look/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">took off in the 1970s</a> as a response to surging oil prices. Heat pumps can be up to five times more efficient than fossil-fuel furnaces, according to electrification advocacy group Rewiring America, which means that at least 70% of people could save money on their energy bills by switching from fossil fuel heaters, the group estimates.
</p><p>
	The cost of a heat pump itself 
	<a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/reviews/hvac/heat-pump-cost" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">varies widely</a> depending on size (how much house it has to heat), type (geothermal vs. air source), and efficiency, then when you add in factors like the cost to refit you existing HVAC system and the cost of labor, well, <a href="https://www.blocpower.io/posts/heat-pump-installation-cost-2023-prices-guide" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it adds up</a>. While heat pumps aren’t cheap, they do at least serve as both a furnace <em>and</em> an air conditioner, two appliances for the price of one, an investment that can pay back over time, Rewiring America said.

## Trump’s ‘Bloodbath’ Comment Was Actually About EVs

date: 2024-03-19, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTc3OTM1OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyMzIwODI5OH0.p4_7Ph0Js1KwF2BnZMUGDtBusflzIYl9kyLieHWqk7A/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>You <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change-wind-solar-electric-vehicles-energy" target="_self">won’t hear me say this often</a>, but Donald Trump kind of sort of has a point. </p>
<p>On Monday, the former president and <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self">presumed Republican nominee</a> rebutted headlines that claimed he’d predicted a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/16/us/politics/trump-speech-ohio.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">‘bloodbath’ if he loses</a>” the November election. To be sure, “bloodbath” isn’t a word you want to throw around when you’re <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/02/supreme-court-donald-trump-trial-january-6.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accused of</a> architecting the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. One could probably even make the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/evaaym/is-trump-really-playing-3d-chess-we-asked-the-masters" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">three-dimensional chess</a> case that Trump <em>intentionally</em> used the word to trigger coverage of his comments. </p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, he posted Monday on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/us/politics/trump-blood-bath-auto-industry.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Truth Social</a> that the Fake News Media “pretended to be shocked at my use of the word BLOODBATH even though they fully understood that I was simply referring to” — that is, electric vehicles from China.</p>
<p>Trump’s full comment came during a rally in Dayton, Ohio, over the weekend and <a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-rally-in-ohio" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">read as follows</a>: </p>
<blockquote>To China, if you’re listening — President Xi, you and I are friends, but he understands the way I deal. Those big monster car manufacturing plants that you are building in Mexico right now, and you think you are going to get that, not hire Americans, and you’re going to sell the car to us — no. We are going to put a 100% tariff on every single car that comes across the lot and you’re not going to be able to sell those cars if I get elected. Now, if I don’t get elected, it’s going to be a bloodbath for the whole — that’s going to be the least of it. It’s going to be a bloodbath for the country. That’ll be the least of it. But they’re not going to sell those cars. </blockquote>
<p><em>Aaaand</em> here’s where my defense of Trump runs out. While he’s correct about some in the media taking his “bloodbath” remark out of context, “there actually are no operating Chinese-owned EV factories in Mexico,” Ilaria Mazzocco, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and an expert on Chinese climate policy, told me. </p>
<p>Trump’s remarks are “not particularly surprising,” though, “in the sense that this topic has become politicized very rapidly,” Mazzocco added. Fear is growing in <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ford-gm-stellantis-byd" target="_self">Detroit</a> and in <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/chinese-ev-cars-biden" target="_self">Washington, D.C.</a> that inexpensive Chinese-branded EVs could make their way to the U.S. from <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/02/27/byd-no-plans-sell-evs-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">yet-to-be-built plants</a> in Mexico, hurting American automakers whose EVs can’t compete at that lower price point yet. As Robinson Meyer <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/chinese-ev-cars-biden" target="_self">wrote for Heatmap</a>, the booming Chinese automaker BYD “recently advertised an <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/663595/byd-seagull-ev-priced-11400-usd-gets-10000-orders-first-day/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$11,000 plug-in hybrid</a> targeted at the Chinese market … Even doubling its price with tariffs would keep it firmly among [the United States’] most affordable new vehicles.”</p>
<p>Mazzocco said this isn’t wholly a bad thing — “there’s a point of value to competition that we shouldn’t forget.” The threat of cheap Chinese EVs has already driven American <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-18/chinese-ev-affordability-frightens-ford-gm-us-automakers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">automakers including Ford</a> to reassess their <a href="https://heatmap.news/cheap-evs-gm-bolt-volvo-ex30" target="_self">electric lineups</a>. That’s a plus since Ford’s smaller and more affordable cars would not only <a href="https://heatmap.news/cheap-evs-gm-bolt-volvo-ex30" target="_self">fill a gap in the U.S. EV market</a>, they’d also address the fact that electric vehicles need to get “cheaper everywhere … if we are to fight climate change,” Meyer has pointed out.</p>
<p>But! It’s also an election year. “EVs have encapsulated everybody’s fears of competition with China,” Mazzocco reminded me. It’s been a particularly rude awakening to realize that Beijing is “actually better at something than the Americans are.” In the face of this reality, both Biden and Trump have been fighting to look tougher than the other on China, especially in big auto states like Michigan, where Trump has <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-ev-charging" target="_self">likewise slammed EVs at his rallies</a>, and Ohio, which could potentially decide control of the White House. </p>
<p>Biden has already ordered the Commerce Department to investigate the potential national security threat of Chinese-made EVs, which currently make up only about 2% of EV imports to the U.S. in the form of Polestar, the <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/09/01/china-electric-car-vehicle-polestar-ev-us-economy-climate-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first Chinese-owned</a> EV company to make moves in the U.S. last year, but <a href="https://jalopnik.com/volvo-is-done-propping-up-struggling-polestar-1851215514" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hardly one that’s thriving</a>.</p><p>The truth is, there’s plenty to debate regarding what America and its automakers should do about the rise of Chinese EVs. When doing so, however — <em>ahem</em>, Mr. Former President — it’s always better to have your facts straight.</p>

## From ink to pixel to ink

date: 2024-03-19, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>I love books. I love reading books but I also love books as objects. And if you’re a designer—or passionate about design—chances are, you also love books. There’s something about the book, as an object, that managed to survive across all the various societal and technological changes.</p>
<p>In the 2010s, during the peak iPad era, people thought paper books were doomed. What’s the point of printing something when you can get hundreds, or even thousands of books inside a single device? And I’ll be honest with you, I went through that phase myself. For years I was only reading on an iPad. And it was great. Until it wasn’t.</p>
<p>There’s something about a printed book that technology can’t replace. I can’t tell you exactly why but I’m sure you know what I’m talking about. Reading a book, handling a book, smelling the ink and the paper, seeing it age over time, those are things that can’t be reproduced in the digital space.</p>
<p>I love books. I love when people pour their hearts and souls into creating great books. And I’m not just talking about the writing. Or the photographing. Or the illustrating. I’m talking about caring about the book itself, as an object.</p>
<p>That’s one of the reasons why I keep buying every book <a href="https://shop.specialprojects.jp">Craig Mod makes</a>. The man knows how to make great books. And you can feel it. You can instantly tell he loved the process as soon as you pick up one of his books.</p>
<p>I never had to make a book myself. I designed a few, back when I was studying graphic design more than a decade ago. But I did experience firsthand what it means to care about creating a great book. That’s because I watched Carl and my brother working together to create the first volume of the <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/selection-architecture">Minimalissimo Selection</a> series. The final product is an incredibly simple object but creating simple objects is painfully hard.</p>
<figure class="m-o" data-template="with"><div class="m-m"><img class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/from-ink-to-pixel-to-ink/1adbc5322f-1710871916/book.jpeg" style="aspect-ratio:1000 / 1333"></div><figcaption>If you're into minimalism and architecture this is a book for you</figcaption></figure>
<p>Before websites like Minimalissimo were a thing, you had to buy books to find visual inspiration. And now you have books created as a result of years of curation of those same websites. From ink, to pixel, and back to ink.</p>
<p>The iPad didn’t manage to kill books the same way smartphones didn’t manage to kill traditional photography. The more we digitize the world the more analogue, physical objects become important. And as creators, it’s important to care about creating quality objects. Because as they say if is worth doing at all, is worth doing well.</p>
<hr />
<p>A final note about the lovely book Carl made. It was a limited run and there won’t be a second edition. But, <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/selection-architecture">there are still copies left so if you want one I suggest you act fast</a>. Carl was also kind enough to set up a 25% discount for the readers of this site. Just use the <code>SELECTION25</code> code at checkout.</p>
<p>Also, if you love books, and coffee, and great filmmaking, Antonio Carusone created an amazing promotional video for the book that I’ll embed down below.</p>

## Ex-Trump Aide Navarro Reports to Prison to Serve Contempt Sentence

date: 2024-03-19, from: VOA News USA

MIAMI, FLORIDA — Peter Navarro, Donald Trump's former White House trade advisor, reported to a Florida prison on Tuesday to begin serving a four-month sentence for contempt of Congress.


Navarro, 74, is the highest-ranking former member of the Trump administration to spend time behind bars for actions stemming from the former Republican president's efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.


Navarro was found guilty of two counts of contempt in September for refusing to comply with a subpoena to testify before the congressional panel that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters.


Navarro, a Harvard-educated economist, had asked the U.S. Supreme Court to allow him to remain free while appealing his conviction, but Chief Justice John Roberts rejected his last-ditch request on Monday.


Navarro, the architect of the "Green Bay Sweep," a plot to block Congress from certifying the 2020 election results, will serve his sentence at a minimum-security federal prison in Miami.


He spoke to reporters in a parking lot before turning himself in.


"I am the first senior White House advisor in the history of our republic that has ever been charged with this alleged crime," Navarro said. "When I walk in that prison today, the justice system, such as it is, will have done a crippling blow to the constitutional separation of powers and executive privilege."


He claimed to be a victim of "partisan weaponization of our justice system."


"Every person who has taken me on this road to that prison is a friggin' Democrat and a Trump hater," Navarro said, adding that he will "walk proudly in there and do my time."


"I will gather strength from this: Donald John Trump is the nominee for the Republican presidential campaign," he said.


Navarro refused to appear for a deposition before the House of Representatives committee that investigated the January 6 attack on Congress and declined to supply documents to the panel.


He was convicted of contempt by a federal jury in Washington after a two-day trial.


Navarro is the second close Trump ally to be convicted of contempt of Congress for defying subpoenas from the House committee.


Steve Bannon, one of the masterminds behind Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, was also found guilty of contempt of Congress.


Bannon was sentenced to four months in prison in January but remains free pending an appeal.


Trump was scheduled to go on trial in Washington on March 4 on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the election won by Democrat Joe Biden.


His trial has been put on hold, however, until the Supreme Court hears Trump's claim that as a former president, he is immune from criminal prosecution.


The Supreme Court has scheduled arguments in the immunity case for April 25.


Trump, 77, was impeached for a second time by the House after the Capitol riot — he was charged with inciting an insurrection — but was acquitted by the Senate.

## Why Moving to 24/7 Clean Electricity Is Going to Be Really, Really Hard

date: 2024-03-19, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTcyMDEyMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MTgxNDUzNX0.X3ZUgpThQ9EUcxaEmb563b05SQE7C84yclKfZNsRSZQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Today, if a company claims to run on “100% clean power,” that generally means it’s adding up its electricity use for the entire year, then offsetting any fossil fuel-generated electricity through the purchase of renewable energy certificates, a.k.a. RECs. So a New York-based firm using natural gas to power its data center at night can offset that dirty power by purchasing RECs generated by a California-based solar farm in the middle of the day, so long as energy production and procurement happen within the same year. </p><p>We call this system “annual matching,” and it may not be much longer for this world.</p><p>The U.S. Treasury Department <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_blank">announced in December</a> that, to qualify for the most generous subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act’s hydrogen production tax credit, clean hydrogen must be produced using a relatively new source of carbon-free electricity generated within the <em>same hour</em> it’s used and in roughly the same location. The hourly matching requirement, which will take effect in 2028, could compel utilities, grid operators, energy producers and consumers to adopt new systems for clean energy accounting, ultimately laying the groundwork for a 24/7 clean electricity market that extends far beyond the hydrogen sector. </p><p>Energy system experts generally hailed the move, and not just because without it, electricity-hungry hydrogen production could potentially do <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/hydrogen-additionality-climate" target="_self">more harm</a> to the climate than good. Annual matching, also, is no longer serving its original purpose of incentivizing the buildout of new renewables. When wind and solar were more expensive than fossil fuels, developers could make up the cost difference by selling annually-matched RECs. But today, wind and solar are often the cheapest energy options available. </p><p>That’s not to say everyone was in favor of hourly matching, however. <a href="https://cleanpower.org/news/green-hydrogen-study-on-time-matching-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Many of the companies</a> that underpin the U.S.’s clean energy generation and <a href="https://resource-solutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Readiness-for-Hourly-U.S.-Renewable-Energy-Tracking-Systems.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accounting systems</a>, some <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/eenews/f/eenews/?id=0000018d-f155-d6ce-a1bd-f35d3a1a0000" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">major hydrogen players</a>, and even a number of <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/f/?id=0000018b-ab2e-d7df-abbb-ef6fb5ca0000" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Senate Democrats</a> say that moving to hourly matching in the next four years could not only prove too logistically challenging, but also lead to infeasibly high costs for clean hydrogen that will <a href="https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/why-45v-may-knock-one-green-hydrogen-project-off-the-map" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hamper the growth</a> of the emerging industry. More than a year of furious lobbying, public commenting, and punditry over the future of America’s nascent hydrogen industry <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-treasury" target="_self">hinges</a> on this question: Can we pull off verifiable 24/7 clean energy?</p><p>There’s an emerging ecosystem of companies trying to help do just that. Granular Energy is a European startup creating software to help utilities and power suppliers move toward 24/7 energy matching by telling them where and when clean energy is most needed. “When you get down to the hourly level,” Natalie Valentin, Granular’s commercial lead for North America, told me, “it can help drive investment in the types of technologies — whether it’s battery storage, clean firm generation, or renewable generation.”</p><p>Utilities and power suppliers generally have hourly generation data on hand, Valentin said. It’s just that the energy attribution certificates they receive from <a href="https://www.leveltenenergy.com/post/intro-renewable-energy-certificates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tracking systems and registries</a> for renewable energy credits don’t usually include this information. “This data is very readily available,” she told me. “What we’re helping to do is put it into a tool that creates transparency, it streamlines the operations, it has that audit trail that's preventing any double counting.”</p><p>Granular links the information from energy certificates with the utility or power provider’s internal metering data to provide an hour-by-hour snapshot of the supplier’s energy mix. That then gives energy suppliers the ability to offer hourly-matched green power programs to their customers.</p><p>All of this would be simpler if electricity customers had insight into their hourly electricity usage in the first place, or if the tracking systems provided suppliers with time-matched certificates upfront. But as it stands, most customers <a href="https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/247-hourly-matching-electricity#:~:text=could%20participate%20in.-,What%20Are%20Some%20of%20the%20Barriers%20to%20Purchasing%20Electricity%20Generated%20to%20Match%20Hourly%20Electricity%20Use%3F,-Because%20buying%20and" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">don’t have meters</a> that provide this level of detail, making it difficult for them to understand where their energy is coming from. And out of the nation’s <a href="https://resource-solutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Tracking-System-Map.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">10 renewable energy credit</a> tracking systems and registries, seven don’t report hourly information.</p><p>The three that do include the nation’s largest grid operator, <a href="https://insidelines.pjm.com/pjm-eis-to-produce-energy-certificates-hourly/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PJM</a>, the nonprofit <a href="https://www.mrets.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Midwest Renewable Energy Tracking System</a>, and the North American Renewables Registry. Seattle-based LevelTen Energy is aggregating the data from these three entities to create a new marketplace for buying, selling, and managing hourly-matched energy certificates, to be launched later this year in regions where hourly tracking exists. The platform is called the <a href="https://www.leveltenenergy.com/alliance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Granular Certificate Trading Alliance</a> (unrelated to Granular Energy, though the company is a supporter of the initiative), and LevelTen is building it in partnership with the Intercontinental Exchange, a tech company that operates global financial exchanges. <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/microsoft-google-others-partner-with-levelten-to-create-first-marketplace-for-24-7-clean-energy/#:~:text=LATEST%20NEWS-,Microsoft%2C%20Google%2C%20others%20partner%20with%20LevelTen%20Energy%20to%20create%20first,for%2024%2F7%20clean%20energy&text=A%20growing%20number%20of%20organizations,energy%20to%20power%20their%20operations." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google and Microsoft</a> are also partners; each has announced plans to move to hourly matching by 2030.</p><p>“We’re looking to provide an end-to-end experience so people can indicate, here's where we have demand,” explained Katie Soroye, a LevelTen executive. Crucially, the platform will also ensure that hourly matching certificates are retired once they’re purchased to prevent double-counting.</p><p>The hope is that the seven tracking systems that lack hourly matching capabilities will soon be either persuaded or mandated to develop them, leading to a country-wide granular certificate marketplace — something the clean hydrogen tax rules were designed to <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_self">help expedite</a>. Once the mandate is finalized, the <a href="https://resource-solutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Readiness-for-Hourly-U.S.-Renewable-Energy-Tracking-Systems.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Center for Resource Solutions found</a>, most of the tracking systems could phase in hourly matching within two years. </p><p>That doesn’t mean they’re eager to make the change, with many citing cost, low demand, and in some cases lack of data availability and confusion over how to handle a more complex dataset as top concerns with hourly matching. Cost is also a major concern for the hydrogen industry overall.</p><p>“To the extent that 24/7 works, it has to increase hydrogen prices,” said Aaron Bergman, a fellow at the nonprofit research group Resources for the Future, although he acknowledged that hourly matching is also likely to reduce emissions. “Now, I think what’s challenging is, is that going to be enough to interfere with the ability to really start building out green hydrogen?” </p><p><a href="https://cleanpower.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ACP_Green_Hydrogen_Deployment_Brief.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The American Clean Power Association</a> thinks so. Its members estimate “a 20-150% price premium for hourly matched hydrogen production” because electrolyzers, the devices used to make clean hydrogen, will only be able to operate when clean electricity is available. The trade group recommends waiting until 2032 to implement hourly matching, saying this will give the market more time to mature and lower prices through economies of scale.</p><p>The whole industry is hardly aligned on this question. Seven companies, including the world’s largest hydrogen producer, filed a <a href="https://hystorenergy.com/hydrogen-industry-support-of-strong-45v-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">joint letter</a> with Treasury officials before the draft rules were released urging them to require 24/7 hourly matching by 2028. “Hourly matching will catalyze cutting-edge, flexible electrolyzer technologies and establish a flourishing and world-leading domestic U.S. advanced electrolyzer manufacturing base,” the letter said.</p><p>The rule-making process will continue with a public hearing scheduled for <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/03/04/2024-04304/section-45v-credit-for-production-of-clean-hydrogen-section-48a15-election-to-treat-clean-hydrogen" target="_blank">later this month</a>. But assuming the hourly-matching requirement stays, it will certainly add momentum to what’s become a movement for 24/7 clean electricity. Even the U.S. federal government has <a href="https://www.fedcenter.gov/programs/eo14057/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">committed</a> to sourcing 100% of their facility’s electricity from carbon-free sources, half of which will be hourly matched by 2030.</p><p>“Time is ticking,” said Bergman. “It’s really standing up something that is relatively new in a relatively short period of time.” Some degree of delays and logistical roadblocks may prove inevitable. But, he said, “it certainly can be done.”</p>

## Arab Americans, US Muslims Fear Bias Attacks After October 7

date: 2024-03-19, from: VOA News USA

Fear of retaliation and reprisals has spread through Arab American and U.S. Muslim communities since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, and the start of Israel’s war in Gaza. As VOA’s Dora Mekouar reports, many Arab Americans say they haven’t felt this on edge since the September 11 terror attacks more than 20 years ago. Camera:  Adam Greenbaum

## There is no EU cookie banner law

date: 2024-03-19, from: OS News

You know those modal screens that interrupt your groove when you are surfing? There are no laws forcing websites to use them. They use them because they choose to. ↫ Bite code! Cookie banners are not only not required, they&#8217;re not even needed, and most implementations you encounter today are illegal anyway. You can use session cookies and anonymous stats cookies without needing any user approval. Companies like to use these cookie banners because they want to make you mad at the law, not at them for tracking you up the wazzoo, and people who actually do know better trot out the cookie banners to enrage you at the government instead of at the corporations exploiting you. EU law only states that if a website wants to track you, they have to let you know. That&#8217;s it. Seems very reasonable to anyone who isn&#8217;t a corporatist.

## More On Pig Butchering

date: 2024-03-19, from: David Rosenthal's blog

Thankfully, pig butchering scams are getting attention. Three weeks after I posted <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/02/tracing-pig-butchers.html"><i>Tracing The Pig Butchers</i></a>, John M. Griffin and Kevin Mei posted <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235"><i>How Do Crypto Flows Finance Slavery? The Economics of Pig Butchering</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Through blockchain addresses used by ‘‘pig butchering’’ victims, we trace crypto flows and uncover methods commonly used by scammers to obfuscate their activities, including multiple transactions, swapping between cryptocurrencies through DeFi smart contracts, and bridging across blockchains. The perpetrators interact freely with major crypto exchanges, sending over 104,000 small potential inducement payments to build trust with victims. Funds exit the crypto network in large quantities, mostly in Tether, through less transparent but large exchanges—Binance, Huobi, and OKX. These criminal enterprises pay approximately 87 basis points in transaction fees and appear to have recently moved at least $75.3 billion into suspicious exchange deposit accounts, including $15.2 billion from exchanges commonly used by U.S. investors. Our findings highlight how the ‘‘reputable’’ crypto industry provides the common gateways and exit points for massive amounts of criminal capital flows. We hope these findings will help shed light on and ultimately stop these heinous crimes.

Their Figure 9 shows the flow of funds over time into the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">scammer's wallets at exchanges</a>. This is how they estimated the $75.3B; their extremely conservative estimate is $35.1B, and their liberal estimate is $237.6B. Note the huge ~$45B increase from January 2021 to January 2023, partly driven by the cryptocurrency boom, and the slowing until January 2024. Presumably the ETF pump will accelerate the rate.<br />
<br />
Below the fold, some commentary on this and other recent developments.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<br />
Note that these numbers are <i>flows</i> not the total revenue for the scammers, there is some double-counting involved as scammers move funds between their accounts at these exchanges. The $15.2B is likely much closer to revenue, because the scammers generally don't want to move significant sums <i>into</i> Western exchanges.<br />
<br />
Griffin and Wei start their tracing from a collection of the wallet addresses which the scammers used to <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">receive funds from victims</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
We start with 3,256 Ethereum addresses, 770 Bitcoin addresses, and 702 Tron addresses. Most addresses are used ten or more times, and 28% of addresses are used more than one hundred times. Of these initial sets, Ethereum addresses receive $5.8 billion in funds, compared to $389 million for Tron and $373 million for Bitcoin. Given that the Ethereum addresses represent approximately 88% of the total funds, we begin by examining Ether (ETH, the native cryptocurrency on Ethereum) and token (commonly known as ERC-20 tokens) transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.
</blockquote>
<br />
They then follow the way the scammers try to <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">obscure their activites</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
We trace victim funds in bulk and follow their paths to centralized exchange deposit addresses from January 2020 to February 2024. Figure 1 plots the resulting network for a three percent sample of nodes from the traced network and highlights many features.
</blockquote>
This reveals four main points:<br />
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">sources of the funds</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
First, the figure shows how crypto often originates from large exchanges where investors commonly have accounts (Coinbase, Crypto.com, and Binance) and flows into the network.
</blockquote>
The victims need to convert fiat into cryptocurrency using well-known, trusted exchanges.</li>
<li>Where the scammers <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">move the funds next</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Second, funds are often swapped for Tether (known as USDT) through Tokenlon.
</blockquote>
Tokenlon is not a mixer, similar to <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/tornado-hit-by-the-department-of-justice">Tornado Cash</a>, but "a relatively obscure decentralized exchange". The scammers' goal is partly to obscure their tracks but also to avoid the volatility of cryptocurrencies by converting to stablecoins at the first opportunity.</li>
<li>The scammers need to <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">find an off-ramp to fiat</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Third, after circulating through various hops in the network, crypto exits the system through centralized exchange deposit addresses.
</blockquote>
Even stablecoins won't by the Lambo, so the scammers have to get their loot to somewhere that can convert it to fiat.</li>
<li>Which exchanges are <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">useful off-ramps</a>?<br />
<blockquote>
Fourth, transactions in amounts above $100,000 and in particular $1 million commonly transfer funds to deposit addresses on Binance, Huobi, and OKX.
</blockquote>
Obviously, they are the offshore exchanges that lack effective KYC/AML, and in particular the one that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-21/binance-ceo-zhao-to-plead-guilty-in-us-settlement-wsj">pled guilty</a>.</li>
</ul>
Note that this research contrasts with the tracing efforts I discussed in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/02/tracing-pig-butchers.html"><i>Tracing The Pig Butchers</i></a>, which traced flows starting from a few victim reports. This research both starts from a much larger collection of victim reported addresses, and uses network analysis techniques to identify a much larger set of scammer wallet addresses. Thus it is understandable that <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-53/">Molly White is skeptical</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
But the $75 billion number was certainly a surprise, and it's hit mainstream outlets including <a href="https://time.com/6836703/pig-butchering-scam-victim-loss-money-study-crypto/"><i>Time</i></a>. I have to say I have some doubts about the number, particularly given other estimates have been in the low billions, but regardless, it's clear that the pig butchering issue in crypto is a multi-billion dollar problem.
</blockquote>
But there are good reasons why Griffin and Wei would come up with much larger numbers for <i>revenue</i> than earlier tracing efforts; they are looking at a much larger fraction of the total scammer network.  Zeke Faux's article in <a href="https://time.com/6836703/pig-butchering-scam-victim-loss-money-study-crypto/"><i>Time</i></a> starts:<br />
<blockquote>
Pig-butchering scammers have likely stolen more than $75 billion from victims around the world, far more than previously estimated, according to a new study.
</blockquote>
That is not what the paper says. <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">It says they</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
recently moved at least $75.3 billion into suspicious exchange deposit accounts
</blockquote>
The paper points out that the $75.3B in <i>flows</i> includes some amount of <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">double-counting</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
If a network sent funds from say OKX to Binance, it would lead to the double-counting of funds. Additionally, the funds may be due to other activities of the criminal networks.  ...  We examine the sources of funds that later enter into these potential scammer deposit addresses and find that $40.2 billion of the $75.3 billion can be attributed to exchanges.
</blockquote>
It is unlikely that all this movement from one exchange to another is between scammer accounts, so $35.1B is a conservative estimate.<br />
<br />
The scammers do send small amounts to <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">exchange deposit wallets</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Across all exchanges, the scammer network initiated 104,460 deposits to centralized exchanges for amounts below $10,000, most commonly in small amounts clustering at round numbers, such as $100, $200 or $500. The transaction patterns mirror the characteristics of inducement payments in pig butchering scams, which are small payments from scammers to victims used to build trust.
...
We find 83% of potential inducement payments are sent from addresses used in more than ten transactions, suggesting limited monitoring by crypto exchanges.
</blockquote>
There is a reason for "limited monitoring by crypto exchanges". The 87 basis points the authors find on movements of $75.3B is $655M in fees over 4 years, enough to motivate turning a blind eye.<br />

Griffin and Wei's Figure 2a shows their trace of a single victim report.  Their figures use the following <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">conventions</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Edges that are concave up represent flows moving from left to right (e.g., the curve moves as if going from 9 o’clock to 3 o’clock). Similarly, edges that are concave down represent flows moving from right to left (e.g., from 3 o’clock to 9 o’clock). Nodes are colored by identity, ... and their size is proportional to the total amount transacted. Edges are colored by transaction size and identity. Green edges are transactions from exchanges, while blue and purple are transactions to exchanges. Edges entering or exiting exchanges with darker colors represent larger transactions.

The left and right nodes are scammer wallets. The right node is a "collection node" that converts victim payments to Tether and aggregates them for onward transmission in larger amounts.<br />
<br />
Their next step was to find other flows into the collection node, as shown in Figure 2b. Even this one step into the network produces a large number of scammer wallet addresses, the addresses to which other victims were directed to send funds. By identifying these wallets the authors generate a huge number of additional "victim reports".<br />

Tracing the flows out of the collection nodes produces an enormous number of other scammer wallets, shown in Figure 2c, as the funds are shuffled around to obfuscate the flows.<br />
<br />
The off-ramps are at exchanges, so the authors need to find the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">scammers deposit addresses</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Since scammers are unlikely to return large sums of stolen funds, we consider deposit addresses that receive more than $100,000 as more likely to be scammer deposit addresses.  These addresses are rarely associated with Western exchanges, but are common within Binance, Huobi, and OKX, as well as exchanges such as Kucoin, Bitkub, and MXC. The common feature of these exchanges is that they have loose KYC procedures and are perceived to be outside of U.S. jurisdiction. To more fully understand the scope of the network, we apply “deposit address clustering” by tracking addresses that send funds into these deposit addresses and finding other recipient deposit addresses associated with the same user. To avoid capturing payments made by criminals for things like inducement payments, we exclude all connections below $100,000 and only consider direct connections.
</blockquote>
This is where the $75.3B number comes from; it is the total inflow into deposit addresses at offshore exchanges believed to be controlled by scammers. Note again the potential for double-counting if scammers move funds between these exchanges. Deposit address clustering was published by Friedhelm Victor in <a href="https://fc20.ifca.ai/preproceedings/31.pdf"><i>Address clustering heuristics for Ethereum</i></a> (Section 5.1):<br />
<blockquote>
To credit the assets to the correct account, exchanges typically create so-called deposit addresses, which will then forward received funds to a main address. As these deposit addresses are created per customer, multiple addresses that send funds to the same deposit address are highly likely to be controlled by the same entity.
...
The forwarded amount is often slightly less than what was received, as the exchange has to pay for the transaction costs. In most cases, deposit addresses are EOAs [Externally Owned Accounts], but they can also be smart contracts. When depositing tokens on the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken for example, users are instructed to send them to a given smart contract address, identical versions of which have been mass deployed in advance.  This makes it trivial to identify all identical token deposit contracts deployed by Kraken. They are designed to forward received tokens automatically, thereby passing on the transaction costs to the user.

Victor's Figure 1 shows how this works. Wallets 0x2 and 0x3 deposit to the same deposit address at exchange A, so they have the same account at exchange A. Wallet 0x4 shares an account with 0x3 at exchange B, so all three are the same entity.<br />
<br />
By analyzing the network graph they discover using these techniques, Griffin and Wei draw the following conclusions about <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">money laundering</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Scammers extensively recirculate and swap funds across different addresses and cryptocurrencies. These transactions incur costs, but may help obfuscate the true source of their funds. We estimate that transaction costs for a network of this scale total to 87 basis points as a portion of outflows to exchange deposit addresses. In contrast, Soudijn and Reuter (2016) find costs of 7-16% to move physical Euro bills from Europe to Columbia and money laundering commission estimates range from 4-12% (US Treasury Department, 2002) and 10-20% (US Treasury Department, 2007). Cryptocurrencies thus appear to be a much more cost-effective channel for moving illicit funds across borders. In total, scammer swap transactions may constitute more than 58% of Tokenlon transactions since 2022. We observe large inflows from potentially Chinese victims in 2020; however, after the Chinese financial authorities banned cryptocurrency trading in late 2021, there appears to be a dramatic decrease in Chinese victims and a shift to US-based victims. Overall, in the set of addresses touched by the criminals, we find $1.172 trillion dollars of volume, 84% of which is in Tether.
</blockquote>
Griffin and Wei <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">conclude</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This project highlights how large-scale tracing of tainted funds can help expose and understand criminal financial activity that can hopefully be used as a roadmap in other criminal contexts. 
There are several other practical implications of our study.
First, organized or “legitimate” crypto exchanges serve as the on- and off-ramps for billions of dollars in criminal proceeds. Users with a crypto exchange account should realize that crypto exchange users are frequent targets of scams, and their funds are just a quick transfer away from being irreversibly lost—a risk that is far less prevalent for traditional investment accounts. Second, our findings indicate that the large players in the crypto space are likely not sufficiently protecting their customers from scams. Third, the Ethereum network appears to drastically reduce barriers for illicit financial flows of transnational organized crime. Fourth, romance scammers prefer the stablecoin Tether over other cryptocurrencies and the Ethereum network over Bitcoin. Fifth, decentralized exchanges also serve as large swapping points to exchange crypto and obfuscate funds. Crypto hedge funds and users (many based in the U.S. and Europe) who might purport to engage in “arbitrage” or “liquidity trading” (PWC, 2023) may simply be making profits by facilitating low-cost money laundering. Finally, the large centralized crypto exchanges located in jurisdictions with opaque regulatory environments (Binance, Huobi, OKX, and others) seem to be preferential potential exit points that can further finance extremely large amounts of criminal activities. Such activity has continued as of February 16, 2024, despite recent crackdowns.

<blockquote>
Paolo Ardoino, the chief executive officer of Tether, called the report false and misleading. “With Tether, every action is online, every action is traceable, every asset can be seized and every criminal can be caught,” Ardoino said in a statement. “We work with law enforcement to do exactly that.”<br />
<br />
Tether has cooperated with authorities in some cases to freeze accounts tied to fraud. But often by the time the crime is reported, the scammers have already cashed out.
</blockquote>
This is more obfuscation from Tether. The paper clearly demonstrates that the scammers rapidly convert their takings to stablecoins, overwhelmingly Tether, and that they are able to use offshore exchanges as their off-ramps.</li>

## Austin: US, Free World 'Will Not Let Ukraine Fail'

date: 2024-03-19, from: VOA News USA

Ramstein, Germany   — Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin says the United States remains determined to provide Ukraine with the resources it needs to fight Russian aggression, even as a U.S. Congress has yet to approve new funding for Ukraine.


“The United States will not let Ukraine fail. This coalition will not let Ukraine fail, and the free world will not let Ukraine fail,” Austin said at the start of this month’s Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting in Germany.


This is Austin’s first international trip since he was hospitalized on January 1 due to complications from surgery to treat his prostate cancer in late December. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) brings together officials from more than 50 nations to coordinate their Ukraine efforts.




The U.S. has contributed about $44 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in February 2022, with allies and partners also committing more than $44 billion in that time frame.


But the U.S. military has run out of congressionally approved funds for replenishing its weapons stockpiles sent to Ukraine, and leadership in the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives has so far refused to bring new aid for Ukraine up for a vote.


“There isn't a way that our allies can really combine forces to make up for the lack of U.S. support,” according to a senior defense official, who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity ahead of the UDCG.


Not only is the U.S. military out of funds for Ukraine, the Defense Department has a funding shortfall from its efforts to provide military support to Ukraine that will grow to least $12 billion by the end of the fiscal year without additional funding from Congress, according to officials. The Pentagon previously acknowledged a funding shortfall of about $10 billion for U.S. military weapons needed to replace those already sent to Ukraine.




In addition to the $10 billion shortage for weapons replenishment, U.S. Army Europe and Africa currently has overspent its budget by about $500 million as it continues to pay for the training of Ukrainians and other Ukraine support mission necessities out of pocket, Col. Martin O’Donnell, the public affairs director for the Army’s forces across those two continents, told VOA.


That shortfall will grow to at least $2 billion by the end of the fiscal year without supplemental funding from Congress, he added.


Ukrainian forces have continued to fight back against Russian forces in the east while inflicting considerable damage to Russian forces in the Black Sea and downing Russian warplanes. However, Moscow— with the help of North Korea and Iran — has drastically ramped up its defense production capacity, forcing Ukraine to retreat from some battles due to ammunition shortages, the senior defense official added.


“Ukraine is heavily outgunned on the battlefield. We've received reports of Ukrainian troops rationing or even running out of ammunition on the front lines,” said the official.




Austin on Tuesday thanked members of the group for digging deeper to get vital security assistance to Ukraine, praising the Czech Republic for recently procuring 800,000 artillery shells for Kyiv. He also highlighted Germany, France, Denmark and Sweden for their new contributions.


Last week, the United States announced its first new round of military aid for Ukraine since late December, in what defense officials called an “ad hoc” package made possible through U.S. Army procurement savings.


The military assistance package is valued at up to $300 million and will provide Ukraine with immediate air defense, artillery and anti-tank capabilities, along with more ammunition for HIMARS rocket launchers and 155-mm artillery rounds. But officials say it is unclear if there will be future procurement savings to produce another extraordinary package of aid.


“This is not a sustainable solution for Ukraine. We urgently need congressional approval of a national security supplemental,” the senior defense official said.


The emphasis on ammunition and air defense will likely be as strong as ever during this UDCG meeting. Officials say Ukraine’s forces need interceptors for a variety of their air defense systems, which they have been running out of as they try to defend against wave upon wave of attacks from Russia.


Coalition leadership group 


To better organize how the UDCG provides Kyiv with military weapons and equipment, the group’s members have formed capability coalitions to identify ways to increase Kyiv’s efficiency and cut costs.


Defense officials say Secretary Austin will convene a meeting of the leads and co-leads of all the capability coalitions for the first time on Tuesday during a special coalition leadership group session.


Air Force capability is co-led by the United States, Denmark and the Netherlands. The armor capability is co-led by Poland and Italy. The artillery capability is co-led by France and the United States. De-mining is co-led by Lithuania and Iceland. Drone capability is co-led by Latvia and the United Kingdom. Information technology is co-led by Estonia and Luxembourg. Integrated air and missile defense capabilities are co-led by Germany and France, and maritime security is co-led by the United Kingdom and Norway.


Critics like Sean McFate, a professor at Syracuse University and author of "The New Rules of War," told VOA the international community is putting its money into expensive military aid that falls short in modern warfare.


“It's not conventional warfare that beat back Russia's blitz. It was Ukrainian guerrilla warfare,” he said. “Ukraine was winning the unconventional fight. But then in fall of 2022, they decided to go conventional against Russia, which was strategically silly.”


McFate added that giving Ukraine more conventional war weapons was, in his view, “the strategic definition of insanity.”


Instead, he said Ukraine and its allies needed to think about unconventional ways where they can leverage their power to defeat Russia, such as guerilla operations and more direct actions deep inside Russia to build on the Russian population’s unfavorable opinions of the war.


“Use your conventional forces to hold the line, but don't invest them to create an offensive which requires a lot more resources,” McFate told VOA.


“M1A1 Abram tanks and F-16 fighter jets … will win tactical victories on the battlefield, but we all know that you can win every battle, yet lose the war, because wars are won on the strategic level, not at the tactical level of warfare,” he said.

## Top US Congressional Leaders Say Spending Deal Reached

date: 2024-03-19, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The top Republican and Democrat in the U.S. Congress on Tuesday said they had reached a deal to keep the government funded through the rest of the fiscal year that began in October, setting off a race to pass it before a weekend shutdown deadline. 


The last sticking point was funding for the Department of Homeland Security, as a surge in migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border has become a major issue in the election rematch between Democratic President Joe Biden and his Republican predecessor Donald Trump. 


Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer revealed the agreement in a pair of statements on Tuesday morning. 


The actual legislative text of the agreement, which must be finalized before lawmakers can vote on it, is still being completed. Current House rules require that lawmakers have three days to consider legislation before bringing it to the floor. 


The package was expected to cover about three-quarters of discretionary government spending, due to come in at about $1.66 trillion for the fiscal year ending September 30. It contains funding for functions that include the U.S. military, transportation, housing and food safety. 


But more fights lie ahead as the nation's $34.5 trillion national debt continues to grow. Biden and House Republicans earlier this month laid out proposed budgets for the next fiscal year, which begins in October, that offered sharply contrasting priorities. 


Johnson so far has also refused to bring up for a vote a $95 billion foreign security aid package that includes money that advocates say is urgently needed for Ukraine in its war against Russia.  


The measure has been approved by the Senate with bipartisan support and is thought to have significant backing in the House if members were given a chance to vote.  


Democrats and Republicans in Congress have been fighting since early last year on funding levels amid a push by hardline House Republicans to cut more spending than had been agreed to in a bipartisan deal enacted into law last June.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-03-19, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

When they report on Trump’s financial situation they don’t take into account that the property, golf courses, buildings, etc are all mortgaged beyond the max, that’s what the NY trial was about, him lying about values for the purpose of getting loans on the property. So his equity in these investments is probably 0 or even negative (because of the fraud). No one is going to loan him anything on the properties, because he has no equity, and the story they tell about New York state liquidating his assets, there almost certainly is nothing to liquidate. Anyone who owns a home and has a mortgage can understand this, it works the same way even if the property is much more valuable than a family home. I asked jokingly what his credit rating must be, but it's a good question to ask, would help regular people relate to the situation.

## The World’s Most Polluted Countries

<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> Flash floods inundated parts of northern Iraq • Fire weather watches are in effect across several states, from Iowa to Maryland • Today marks the official start of spring.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Just 7 countries met WHO pollution limits in 2023</h3><p>
<strong></strong>A region’s air should contain no more than 5 micrograms per cubic meter of the dangerous pollutant known as PM2.5, according to World Health Organization recommendations. In Bangladesh last year, the average concentration was 79.9 micrograms, making it the most polluted country in the world. Pakistan, India, Tajikistan, and Burkina Faso also had alarmingly high levels of PM2.5, which comes primarily from burning fossil fuels and is linked to 4 million premature deaths every year. The <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0fdc317a99&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">findings</a> come from Swiss company IQAir, which uses 30,000 air quality monitors to understand pollution levels across the world. “The number of countries and regions with air quality monitoring has steadily increased over the past six years,” the company <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=97053531bc&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a press release.

	In 2023 just seven countries had air quality that met the WHO guidelines: Australia, Estonia, Finland, Grenada, Iceland, Mauritius, and New Zealand. Average PM2.5 concentration across the U.S. was 9.1 micrograms, and Columbus, Ohio, was the most polluted major city in America.
</p><h3>2. DOE expects geothermal boom by 2050</h3><p>
<strong></strong>A <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=1058237b2e&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> from the Department of Energy projects <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=465e5ae304&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">geothermal</a> energy deployment in the U.S. will grow dramatically by 2050, so long as developers can bring down costs. The DOE says geothermal could account for up to a third of the additional clean energy the country will need by 2050 to hit President Biden’s emissions targets and meet growing electricity demand, <em>E&E News</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0f89f71c95&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a>. Geothermal energy harnesses the heat from beneath the Earth’s surface for around-the-clock clean energy. Innovations in drilling technology are expected to bring the price of geothermal power down from $100 per megawatt-hour to as low as $60 per megawatt-hour by 2030, which would put it roughly in line with other energy sources, the DOE said. And new geothermal sites will need to be tapped: The report said 18 states will likely have geothermal operations by 2050, up from seven now.
</p><h3>3. Report: Ford pivoting to small EVs</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Ford is reportedly “pivoting” from big electric vehicles to smaller, cheaper EVs in an attempt to keep up with Chinese manufacturers like BYD. <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=109769fdde&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">reported</a> the company has put together a team to work on a new electric platform for its small EVs, with the first vehicle slated to arrive in 2026 and cost around $25,000. “Plans for an electric three-row SUV have been delayed,” <em>Bloomberg</em> added.

<strong></strong>In case you were wondering how things are going at CERAWeek, the big oil and gas conference taking place in Houston this week, <em>Reuters</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d9b3e1947e&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">reported</a> that “top oil executives took to the stage … to vocally oppose calls for a quick move away from fossil fuels.” “We should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas, and instead invest in them adequately,” said Amin Nasser, CEO of Saudi Aramco. His remarks were reportedly met with applause and echoed by leaders from Shell, Petrobras, and Exxon Mobil. Petrobras CEO Jean Paul Prates warned rushing the energy transition will create a “crisis that we will never forget.” Meg O’Neill, CEO of Woodside Energy, said the debate had become too “emotional,” and claimed the market for clean fuel technologies is some decades away. U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm pushed back, pointing to projections showing oil and gas peaking demand by 2030, and called the transition “an undeniable, inevitable, and necessary realignment of the world’s energy system.”
</p><h3>5. Harvard pulls the plug on solar geoengineering experiment </h3><p>
<strong></strong>Researchers at Harvard have <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=286b514b01&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">abandoned</a> a plan to conduct what would have been one of the first solar geoengineering experiments in the stratosphere. Solar geoengineering – also known as “solar radiation management” – involves reflecting sunlight back into space by spraying aerosols into the stratosphere in an attempt to cool temperatures on Earth. It has long been a somewhat fringe idea among scientific circles – a sort of option of last resort – but interest has grown as global emissions climb and the Earth gets hotter. While most solar geoengineering research has happened in labs, Harvard’s Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment (SCoPEx) was going to launch a high-altitude balloon to release aerosols and observe their behavior. But the project was controversial from the start and encountered multiple delays. In the end its lead investigator walked away. “The platform developed for SCoPEx is expected to be repurposed for basic scientific research in the stratosphere unrelated to solar geoengineering,” the university said in a <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=b48ff6a072&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-03-19, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Developing great products is something like the NBA which they always say is a business, esp when a player you love is traded. Happened recently with a point guard, Immanuel Quickley, traded from Knicks to Raptors. He wasn't the only heart of the Knicks, but he was one of them. He has a competitive grace you don't see very often. Quickley was one of those guys you knew would be the starting point guard on some NBA team, he was that good. But he was unlikely to get there on the Knicks, so we can be happy for him because he is the starting point guard on the Raptors, but we lost something important there. But the business side, if done well, opens the door for bigger love. I love watching the Knicks win they way they are winning now. That's what I want from developing software. I want to create a global team of truly independent developers, filling the void left by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation">predation</a> of the silos. There won't even be a business model for much of what we do, but there will be lots of teamwork and lots of fun, because the best accomplishment is when we do it as a team. We're going to play a game we started to play in the mid-90s, and somewhere somehow forgot we could still play it. We can. I am old now, I feel it, I can't produce end-user software much longer, but I don't want to leave until we have this thing rebooted.

## TrueNAS CORE 13 is the end of the FreeBSD version

date: 2024-03-19, from: OS News

Bad news from BSD land – the oldest vendor of BSD systems is changing direction away from FreeBSD and toward Linux. NAS vendor iXsystems has been busy this year, but apart from some statements in online user communities, it hasn&#8217;t been talking about the big news. Back in 2022, we covered TrueNAS CORE 13, the new release of its FreeBSD-based turnkey OS for NAS servers, and in that article we mentioned its new product, the Debian-based TrueNAS SCALE, aimed at providing storage for Kubernetes users. Now it seems the company is betting its future on that Linux-based product, meaning the end is in sight for the FreeBSD offering. ↫ Liam Proven at The Register Very sad to read, as more monoculture is not exactly great, but at the same time, from a corporate perspective, it&#8217;s also not entirely unexpected to focus on the server operating system with by far the widest industry support. I hope the fork mentioned in the article gains some steam, because having competition in this space is crucially important.

## The U.S.–China Rivalry in a New Medieval Age

date: 2024-03-19, updated: 2024-03-19, from: RAND blog

Trends like weakening governments and fragmenting societies suggest that the era of industrial superpowers is over and we've entered a new medieval age. The U.S.-China rivalry may have more in common with the fitful conflicts of the 14th century than with the cataclysmic world wars of the 20th.

## AI and the Evolution of Social Media

date: 2024-03-19, updated: 2024-03-14, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Oh, how the mighty have fallen. A decade ago, social media was <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2016/04/16/160609/remaking-social-media-for-the-next-revolution/">celebrated</a> for sparking democratic uprisings in the Arab world and beyond. Now front pages are splashed with stories of social platforms’ role in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/05/09/trump-false-election-claims-elon-musk-twitter/">misinformation</a>, business <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/17/technology/google-facebook-ad-deal-antitrust.html">conspiracy</a>, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/05/ftc-proposes-blanket-prohibition-preventing-facebook-monetizing-youth-data">malfeasance</a>, and risks to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/facebooks-dangerous-experiment-teen-girls/620767/">mental health</a>. In a 2022 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2022/12/06/social-media-seen-as-mostly-good-for-democracy-across-many-nations-but-u-s-is-a-major-outlier/">survey</a>, Americans blamed social media for the coarsening of our political discourse, the spread of misinformation, and the increase in partisan polarization.</p>
<p>Today, tech’s darling is artificial intelligence. Like social media, it has the potential to change the world in many ways, some favorable to democracy. But at the same time, it has the potential to do incredible damage to society...</p>

## This Carbon Removal Startup Is Eyeing a Major Price Milestone

date: 2024-03-19, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTc2MjU5MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyMTIwNzczNH0.tgYnLh4V54HUWoemJ5hX0M-ljUPwnl7PDPOU7F37jsc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Pretty much every startup that’s building machines to suck carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and stash it underground has claimed it will be able to get its costs down to less than $100 per ton — eventually. </p><p>But a new contender in the race, a San Francisco-based company called Spiritus, is making a compelling case that it could get there faster. On Tuesday, Spiritus announced plans to build its first direct air capture, or “DAC” project in central Wyoming, nicknamed Orchard One. The company will start small but ultimately wants to expand the facility to capture 2 million tons of CO2 per year.</p><p>Achieving that scale at the sub-$100 price point would be <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/secretary-granholm-launches-carbon-negative-earthshots-remove-gigatons-carbon-pollution" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">game-changing for direct air capture</a>, which is still far too expensive to be a viable climate solution. Most companies in the field are cagey about revealing their current costs, but the industry-average price is <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/08/how-to-get-direct-air-capture-under-150-per-ton-to-meet-net-zero-goals/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">believed to be between $600 and $1,000</a> per ton.</p><p>So what makes Spiritus different? Here are three reasons we’ll be keeping an eye on the company.</p><h3>It’s making use of a potentially … fruitful new material</h3><p>Spiritus’ project will not look anything like the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/oced/DACHubs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">industrial-style shipping containers full of fans</a> that have become the defining form factor for DAC plants. The company’s central innovation is a squishy white ball that founder Charles Cadieu describes as an artificial lung. </p><p>“While it looks kind of simple, it's actually a breakthrough material that has an incredible amount of surface area,” he told me over Zoom, while holding one up and squeezing it like a stress relief toy. “And it has holes all over it that allow the CO2 to go right inside.” Though it’s about the size of a tennis ball, its branch-like interior structure has a surface area equivalent to a tennis <em>court</em>, he said.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image image-crop-custom">
<img alt="A hand holding the Orchard One \u201cfruit.\u201d" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="fb6b79986afa0b3a47c3597fdc4d4e4a" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="6976c" loading="lazy" src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTc2Njk3OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyNDg4MTMzNH0.jQcl-toobIRxqF4d_8hdO0CWGA7iSK1CTRqvdjUueFo/image.jpg?width=596&height=557&quality=90&coordinates=187%2C378%2C234%2C245"/>
<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Courtesy of Spiritus</small></p><p>The ball is made of a proprietary material that selectively attracts CO2 molecules. As air wafts through it, CO2 sticks to its interior surfaces like a magnet. Spiritus will manufacture millions of these balls, lay them out on trays, and stack the trays on tree-like rigs — hence the name Orchard One. Concept images depict a small colony of cylindrical structures that will house the trays, almost like miniature <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_City" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wilco towers</a>, sprouting up amid the Wyoming sagebrush.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="Orchard One rendering." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="c40fb2e17db86833bbf19806644a44da" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="26123" loading="lazy" src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTc2Njk4Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyMDU5MjA5OH0.dyHu3xI5H9GNq_xYHqBkWseKvIvyrhyMK_Z9-goT6kQ/image.jpg?width=980"/>
<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Courtesy of Spiritus</small></p><p>After a few hours exposed to the elements, the balls, which Spiritus prefers to call “fruits,” will be full of carbon. The company will then transfer them to a separate chamber and apply heat, causing them to expel the CO2. That stream of carbon will be compressed and delivered to an underground CO2 storage well, while the fruits will be returned to their towers to live the same day over and over again.</p><h3>It requires a lot less energy</h3><p>Though the concept is somewhat whimsical, the company is making serious claims about its cost and performance. The biggest expenses for direct air capture projects are materials and energy, and Spiritus has made significant improvements on both fronts. Cadieu told me they can manufacture their sorbent for a tenth of the cost of other, “state of the art sorbents that are out there today,” and that “furthermore, it’s 10 times as effective” at capturing carbon. In other words, Spiritus claims it can capture more carbon from the air at a time, using fewer, cheaper materials than other methods.</p><p>Since the capture part of the process is passive, the company doesn’t need to use energy-intensive fans to filter the air. Also, the temperature required for the second step, where heat is applied to the balls to release the CO2, is lower than 212 degrees Fahrenheit — low enough to be generated using electricity. Cadieu said Spiritus plans to procure energy from renewable sources so that the entire process has net-negative greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Spiritus isn’t the only company with a low-cost sorbent and passive capture method. Notably, the DAC process <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/heirloom-carbon-microsoft-removal" target="_self">pioneered by Heirloom</a>, which opened its first commercial-scale plant in California last year, shares those features, but it requires much higher temperatures — 1,650 degree Fahrenheit — to isolate the captured carbon. </p><p>Though Spiritus still has to prove this all works as promised in the real world, the company has earned an early vote of confidence from Frontier, the coalition of tech companies with a $1 billion fund to help carbon removal scale. Last year, Frontier <a href="https://frontierclimate.com/writing/fall-2023-purchases" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paid Spiritus $500,000</a> to buy its first 713 removal credits, each of which represents a ton of carbon that will be permanently sequestered underground. (The money is more of a development grant than anything indicative of the company’s costs.)</p><p>“We look for companies that learn and iterate quickly, and we were impressed by what we saw from Spiritus when they applied,” Joanna Klitzke, the procurement and ecosystem strategy lead at Frontier, told me. “And actually, since then, the team has made really strong improvements and steady progress on both their sorbent and their process performance.”</p><p>According to the company’s application for funding from Frontier, Spiritus estimates that for the first phase of Orchard One — when the project is capturing less than 2,000 tons per year — its levelized cost per ton of carbon will be about $149, not including the cost of burying the carbon underground. By phase two, at a scale of about 500,000 tons per year, it expects to get that cost down to less than $100. And by phase three, at the full scale of 2 million tons per year, it expects to achieve sub-$75 capture.</p><p>Cadieu told me the company is already in talks with large buyers to purchase carbon removal from Orchard One for “far less” than the per-ton price Frontier paid. </p><h3>It’s following the three rules of real estate: location, location, location</h3><p>Spiritus doesn’t expect to have phase one of the project up and running until 2026. But it already has a running start. The land lease is locked down, the underground pore space where the company will inject the captured carbon has been identified, and a monitoring well is already scheduled to be drilled — according to its Frontier application.</p><p>Wyoming has proved to be a relatively welcoming place for this emerging industry. Orchard One is joining another direct air capture plant already under development in the southwest part of the state called <a href="https://www.carboncapture.com/project-bison-wy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Project Bison</a>. Cadieu gave three reasons the project landed there: There’s a local workforce with relevant experience from the oil and gas industry, the state has the ideal geology to trap the captured carbon underground, and Wyoming has been at the forefront of developing clear regulations for carbon sequestration. It was one of the first states to gain authorization from the Environmental Protection Agency to permit carbon storage wells, and as of December had already permitted three. Another advantage in Wyoming is abundant renewable energy from wind farms.</p><p>Spiritus has yet to reveal exactly where in Wyoming Orchard One will be built, but Cadieu told me he has been in close contact with officials at the town, county, and state levels, and that the reception has been enthusiastic. He said the project will create “hundreds of jobs during construction” and “many dozens of jobs” when the facility is operating, and that the company will deliver a portion of its profits back into the community.</p>

## After 41 years, my first assembly program on my first computer, the Tomy Tutor

date: 2024-03-19, from: Old Vintage Computer Research

We got it in 1983, I think, so it only took me about 41 years to get around to it. This Tomy Tutor isn't a replacement system I secondarily acquired, nor is it a Ship of Theseus Frankenstein rebuild. This is my <em>actual</em> first computer, in its original case, on its original components, with the Federated Group sticker still on the original box. And it still works.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjQ9LAGVCfrBn9_Z9yd6t7kAwVbOM-W9wqL1piD8_IM2iqNqqcC33qajRNf7PkWXeMnUZboV7IU2_7mDwoAi7gTY-g_q5VhnlmrAWMeEtJ5O7oj76rNVl6nADng7TQeqdXAR45cpSfzgCiHo6cskJ0U1C-dSLvNA6EVZzSUBJE29Y7DTsNNCwzUIL1TKKs/s3648/PXL_20240309_211811231.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="2736" data-original-width="3648" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjQ9LAGVCfrBn9_Z9yd6t7kAwVbOM-W9wqL1piD8_IM2iqNqqcC33qajRNf7PkWXeMnUZboV7IU2_7mDwoAi7gTY-g_q5VhnlmrAWMeEtJ5O7oj76rNVl6nADng7TQeqdXAR45cpSfzgCiHo6cskJ0U1C-dSLvNA6EVZzSUBJE29Y7DTsNNCwzUIL1TKKs/s320/PXL_20240309_211811231.jpg"/></a></div>

Now, why so long? Well, for one thing, it was only supposed to be a training wheels computer because a full Commodore 64 system would have cost too much, but my folks wanted to see whether we'd take to a home computer and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N8AzoDzQhM">His High Holy Munificence Fred R. Rated</a> was blowing these babies out for a song by then. The receipt has long since disappeared, though $99 sounds about right plus maybe around $40 or so for a joystick, cassette deck and some cartridges, compared to somewhere between $200 and $300 for the recently discounted 64 &mdash; which didn't include anything else. (It tells you something about our family finances at the time when a C64 was too <em>expensive</em>.) I immediately started writing my own BASIC programs on it in its perverse little BASIC dialect and when my folks indeed saved up and bought us a C64 system the next year (complete with 1702 monitor and 1541 disk drive), I refused to use it. In <s>retaliation</s> my best interests, my parents forcibly relocated the Tomy to storage and I went on to do even bigger things on the Commodore, making it, not the Tutor, the defining computer of my childhood. That's why there's still <a href="/2023/05/refurb-weekend-commodore-128dcr.html">a Commodore 128DCR on my desk</a>.
<p>
The other reason is that there was never really a simple way to do it. Even when I found out what CPU was actually inside (incredibly a 16-bit TMS 9995, an evolved version of the TMS 9900 in the Texas Instruments 99/4 and 99/4A), there was never a Tomy assembler, and other than its small amount of scratchpad RAM (256 bytes) the entirety of the Tutor's 16K of memory is tied up in the 9918ANL VDP video chip. That sort of architecture was typical for the family, but that also means that almost everything is stored in non-executable VDP RAM, so short of burning your own cartridge EPROMs there's no way to actually create and run a machine language program on the Tutor. The first flashcart for the Tutor didn't exist until around 2016 and it was still all ROM; furthermore, while the 99/4A could have its CPU-addressable RAM expanded (as well as the 99/8, its unreleased successor to which the Tomy Tutor is closely related), there wasn't ever a Tutor RAM expansion cartridge either until very recently. But now there are multiple homebrew options even for obscure home computers like this one, and at last I've got my own assembly language program finally running on it.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj3oqNRuTTZQRkO62eUK_dbqlmAzZCEz9-CVt8CuhUHZgIFnPFNxElBe6SoBsbSFChROZumsbdi1MWXYp_OsCtfEk9jeKW5XPdXyCLxwT14rRBPunzSYfpRdQRdLtYBSorcX4sdqDj8ZRV5dTcW31Sih-UHHONKAjcJtJG3-LtqNQTcofKseu3W6dWl67I/s4080/PXL_20240309_070122354.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="3072" data-original-width="4080" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj3oqNRuTTZQRkO62eUK_dbqlmAzZCEz9-CVt8CuhUHZgIFnPFNxElBe6SoBsbSFChROZumsbdi1MWXYp_OsCtfEk9jeKW5XPdXyCLxwT14rRBPunzSYfpRdQRdLtYBSorcX4sdqDj8ZRV5dTcW31Sih-UHHONKAjcJtJG3-LtqNQTcofKseu3W6dWl67I/s320/PXL_20240309_070122354.jpg"/></a></div>

And it's all done with its own, better I/O routines (if I do say my own better self) as a basis for bigger projects. But first, a little tour of the Tutor itself, and then we'll dig in.

Texas Instruments' home computer series, including the famous TI 99/4A, was the logical consequence of TI's "one company, one computer architecture" policy. Indeed, the 1976 TMS 9900 CPU was basically their 16-bit 990 minicomputer architecture in an ungainly 64-pin DIP chip package and quite possibly (the only alternative is the General Instrument CP1600) the first single chip 16-bit microprocessor commercially available. It was fabbed in NMOS on a 4.5 micron process with about 8,000 transistors and initially topped out at a respectable 3MHz, though its pervasively microcoded architecture required sometimes large cycle counts per instruction. The 9918 video display processor in the original 99/4 evolved with a new bitmap mode to become the 9918A in the 99/4A, and, outlasting its originator, was one of the most common video chips of the early home computer era (Sord, MSX, CreatiVision/Dick Smith Wizzard, ColecoVision/Coleco ADAM, and many, many more). The original 99/4 was the winning design of three internal home system efforts in 1979, but was derided for its "calculator" keyboard, lack of lower case and a high MSRP; the upgraded 99/4A d&eacute;buted in 1981 with an improved keyboard, better video, more expansion options and a lower price.
<p>
But TI was first and foremost in the chip business, and at the time was the largest semiconductor manufacturer on the planet. TI realized that the physical size of the CPU was harming its commercial viability &mdash; though TI's dubious management decisions were just as big a factor &mdash; and developed more conventional 40-pin versions, first as microcontrollers with on-board RAM and ROM, then with more typical 8-bit data buses. The most advanced of these was the TMS 9995 which had a few extra opcodes, a primitive pre-fetch facility, 256 bytes of on-chip RAM (we'll get to why this is notable when we discuss assembly language programming) and an internal decrementer for timing and event counting. It was noticeably faster than the 9900 and TI planned to implement it in its next generation of home computers, the low-end black and white 99/2 intended to compete against systems like the ZX-81 and Timex Sinclair 1000, and the high-end 99/8 with more memory, built-in peripherals and a larger keyboard.
<p>
Before that could happen, however, TI got deep in the weeds against their old nemesis Commodore under Jack Tramiel and ended up cancelling both the 99/2 and 99/8 in 1983 (exiting the home computer market completely in 1984), though not before there were spinoffs. It's not clear how Japanese toy manufacturer Tomy got involved but in 1982 Tomy adapted the in-development 99/8 architecture using the same 9995 CPU and 9918A VDP into their own home computer in Japan, manufactured by Matsushita (Panasonic) under contract. This computer was called the Tomy Pyuuta (&#12404;&#12421;&#12358;&#22826;, also variously romanized as the Tomy Pyuta or Tomy Py&umacr;ta). 

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhGvEIAVlkDauCf5HnZ3-1wWKnE_3cGL9YC1EpY5vBfdVIjs-7Elkgzc9f-9V6qXBhKOa4Y9vJa_ZaD6fg3-ScWULzrb6iQpnvNnK_vOtjr0u2jPX7VGvHxz_RDOte9IZBFPHKrkCkGzVRJ6ElQx4vsFbLW0TL9wy5dQ6ZZToosgi4URSpffGkUL7vl0aM/s2048/IMG_20200606_142136.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="1536" data-original-width="2048" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhGvEIAVlkDauCf5HnZ3-1wWKnE_3cGL9YC1EpY5vBfdVIjs-7Elkgzc9f-9V6qXBhKOa4Y9vJa_ZaD6fg3-ScWULzrb6iQpnvNnK_vOtjr0u2jPX7VGvHxz_RDOte9IZBFPHKrkCkGzVRJ6ElQx4vsFbLW0TL9wy5dQ6ZZToosgi4URSpffGkUL7vl0aM/s320/IMG_20200606_142136.jpg"/></a></div>

The Pyuuta wasn't, and wasn't intended as, a 99/8 clone. Unlike the 99/8's higher-end aspirations, the Pyuuta was targeted explicitly at younger children, using a friendly yet durable large plastic case and spill-resistant rubber Chiclet keys. For cartridges Tomy licensed some of Konami's arcade games like Frogger and Scramble and created a few of their own, and for peripherals they provided game controllers (included) and a cassette recorder (optional) for saving your work. Eventually <a href="/2020/06/tfw-you-find-last-cartridge.html">they planned to release</a> a modem, floppy disk, printer and speech synthesizer, all presumably using TI's reference designs except the printer which was a modified Astor MCP-40 plotter.

Although the basic BIOS was based on the TI's and the title screen in particular <a href="https://4apedia.com/index.php?title=File:Main_TI_Startup_Screen.png">is very similar</a>, Tomy prominently advertised it was a 16-bit system, yet focused more on games and graphics than programming. Like the unexpanded 99/4 and 99/4A, all of the included 16K RAM in the Pyuuta is dedicated to the VDP, for which Tomy created a built-in paint program and a highly constrained dialect of BASIC ("G-BASIC") to manipulate screen elements and sprites with katakana keywords. It ran using a 10.738635MHz 945/88 crystal divided by three for video (standard NTSC 315/88 3.579545MHz) and four for the CPU (945/352, 2.68465875MHz). The processor clock speed was slower on paper than the 3MHz 9900 in the 99/4A which came off a 12MHz crystal, but the Pyuuta was nevertheless faster because of the 9995's efficiencies and a critical architectural difference I'll discuss shortly.
<p>
The Pyuuta was a reasonable success in Japan and Tomy decided to export it to other markets by translating the OS and G-BASIC to English. This updated version was imported more or less directly by Adam Imports UK as the Grandstand Tutor, but reviewers were displeased with G-BASIC's profound limitations and the machine was quietly withdrawn. As an upgrade TI must have provided (unwittingly or otherwise) the code for TI Extended BASIC to Tomy to port, since Tomy BASIC has similar to nearly identical tokens, memory usage and syntax, and a full BASIC based on it was released first as an add-on device for the Pyuuta and then built-in to the next generation system Tomy themselves intended to sell in the United States. This was the Tomy Tutor in 1983.

Tomy USA hired <i>Real People</i> host Sarah Purcell as their spokeperson, who touted the computer as a system so easy to use that kids could teach themselves how to use it (it's true: I did!). She wasn't as high-profile as TI's Bill Cosby, but she was hardly unknown to the target demographic('s parents), and she hadn't committed any criminal offenses either. Unfortunately their otherwise promising marketing campaign was most notable for the most frequent use of the word "real" in a single pamphlet, as well as a five-day kick-the-tires-for-free deal which was about as successful as Apple's later "Test Drive a Macintosh" promotion. (NARRATOR: By which he means it wasn't.)
<p>
Like the Pyuuta, Tomy prominently touted the Tutor's 16-bit processor, but provided no way to directly access it. A couple years earlier the Tutor might have been a compelling system and one of the "real" kids on the box even wrote me a few years back to mention he rather enjoyed the games, but the video game crash was in full swing by then and Tomy's intentional toy aesthetic quickly became the kiss of death. No wonder Fred R. Rated was trying to get rid of them.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhKUgrA66KPHkwuvb85aZ1A9is588VtYCRXETRBLgwi7hPuRGpKRhp9ry69UGLXcI4Y1fi3SeeYcqfLljFR5k9ffr8UWkjonwgO0XO-AZAIIbIaQePdtY3Pjbz7JImw1gIq1q5gxNZXPpQvkhrZiL2E98gmyx7jJhlMg3CCFJlb2mDyX0VyeaXy-DNdOSk/s2048/DSCN6996.JPG" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="1536" data-original-width="2048" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhKUgrA66KPHkwuvb85aZ1A9is588VtYCRXETRBLgwi7hPuRGpKRhp9ry69UGLXcI4Y1fi3SeeYcqfLljFR5k9ffr8UWkjonwgO0XO-AZAIIbIaQePdtY3Pjbz7JImw1gIq1q5gxNZXPpQvkhrZiL2E98gmyx7jJhlMg3CCFJlb2mDyX0VyeaXy-DNdOSk/s320/DSCN6996.JPG"/></a></div>

Tomy apparently lost so much money on the Tutor that they ended up producing very few peripherals for the system in either the United States or Japan. This picture shows the complete setup in the United States, namely a tape recorder with custom electronics, an Anglicized version of those disc-based joy controllers which made the Intellivision seem like a paragon of ergonomics, and a tough-as-nails single joystick sold as the Joy Stick (insert joke here). And that was it. The floppy disk drive, printer and speech synthesizer promised in both countries never appeared as other than a single picture in the Purcell pamphlet, the printer interface sold in Japan as part of the BASIC-1 add-on was never sold abroad, and most critically the "TI Adaptor" &mdash; nothing less than a Tomy rebadge of the <a href="http://unige.ch/medecine/nouspikel/ti99/pebox.htm">TI Peripheral Expansion Box</a> &mdash; that would have included additional memory and storage options was vapourware too.

The Tutor was also not an exact copy of the Pyuuta either, although the core silicon (the 9995 CPU, 9918A VDP video chip [9929A for PAL] and SN76489 DCSG sound chip) is the same, primarily differing in the BIOS ROM, the absence of a Japanese character set, the presence of Tomy BASIC, and slightly different memory banking logic. The systems are otherwise nearly totally compatible such that Japanese Pyuuta cartridges will generally run on American or PAL Tutors and vice versa, language support notwithstanding, with only one of the American cartridges &mdash; its sole explicitly educational title &mdash; being specific to the United States.

The Tutor, as with the Pyuuta before it, started with the TI 99/4A's title screen but with animation, scrolling the colour bars vertically. It felt like a friendly computer from the moment you turned it on and the larger 32x24 text cells actually reinforced that somewhat (plus making it much easier to read on our little Panasonic colour TV).

The Tutor menu, directly translated from the Japanese menu in the Pyuuta, was also inspired by the TI's menu, but instead uses a "pointer" rather than selecting items by number. It was likewise very easy for a child to grasp. On the Tutor, the GRAPHIC and BASIC modes are always available as part of its sizeable 48K of built-in ROM. The CARTRIDGE option only appears if a cartridge is detected, which we'll talk about in a moment.
<p>
Unlike the TI 99/4A which used serially addressed "GROMs" for BASIC and much other software (which on top of that can't contain native code and are necessarily written in an interpreted bytecode called GPL), all of the Tutor ROMs and cartridges are directly connected to the bus and therefore tremendously faster. Although Tomy BASIC is also based on GPL, Tomy's GPL dialect is a stripped-down variant specialized for this task, and the program text is directly accessible like any other data in ROM. All of this, plus the 9995's prefetch, are why the Tutor's (and Pyuuta's) slightly slower clocked CPU runs so much more swiftly in practice than the 99/4A's.

The Tutor's GRAPHIC mode is a simple built-in paint program that takes full advantage of the 9918A's 256x192 bitmap mode, offering two colours per line in each 8x8 cell &mdash; substantially better than systems like the C64 or ZX Spectrum with two colours per <em>cell</em>. A little rocket cursor moved with the arrow keys indicated the current location, and when you were at the desired cell, you could then edit it using the palette and the editing square on the lower right. GRAPHIC mode also supported four large 16x16 sprites &mdash; to hide the 9918's limitation of no more than four sprites per scan line &mdash; which could be crudely moved or animated by GBASIC programs (no hyphen in the English name).

GBASIC, however, was so limited &mdash; barely any string support, small program space, terse syntax and a couple severe bugs &mdash; that I spent most of my early elementary life in Tomy BASIC. I wrote some games and some simple utilities and saved them to tape, and I still have one of these tapes, though I carelessly overwrote most of its contents later. Yet despite its lineage as a descendant of TI Extended BASIC, Tomy BASIC intentionally supported less than its ancestor, likely to keep inquisitive kids like me in a memory-safe "sandbox." There were commands for sound, character graphics and some custom character shapes, but most of these features were poorly documented (if at all), and there wasn't any supported facility for directly accessing bitmapped graphics or sprites &mdash; let alone arbitrary reads and writes to VDP memory.
<p>
Still, the "sandbox" concept ended up being unsuccessful because a number of Tomy BASIC commands don't bounds-check properly, and I remember very clearly crashing it multiple times one day trying to figure out how the <tt>COLOR</tt> keyword worked. (Alas, I was too young at the time to realize the significance of what I'd done.) Such bugs even facilitated a clever hack to enable sprites, though this hack unsurprisingly has notable limitations, and there was no way to directly access VDP registers for other features like high resolution or 40-column mode. BASIC was as much as you could do on a stock Tutor and other than a small user group in the Los Angeles area I didn't know anyone else who had one. It wasn't until several years later that I got the Tutor back, and by then I was knee-deep in Commodore programming, including handcoding 6502 machine language opcodes in the Epyx FastLoad monitor. The Tutor had been fun but I could do more with the Commodore 64 and the 128 we got after that.

Emulation came late to the Tutor both due to its obscurity and a profound lack of hardware documentation. In 1998 yours truly wrote the first Tutor "simulator," which I christened Tutti, ironically for the Commodore 64 so that it could be run anywhere a C64 emulator was supported (back then I used C64S and later Frodo). It was designed to mimic the Tutor's look and feel using a character set I labouriously drew by eye, a custom keyboard driver, raster interrupts for the 9918A's split screen modes, simple tone audio, and colour approximations with the VIC-II's palette. It had a fully functional title screen and menu plus reasonably accurate looking but very primitive GRAPHIC, GBASIC and BASIC modes. For its behaviour I manually figured out how fast things ran and added delays and tweaks, and reverse-engineered the BASIC and GBASIC editors. Surprisingly, a portion of Tutti is actually part of the project we'll do today, so hang onto it in the back of your head.
<p>
It took five more years for the first true Tomy Tutor emulator, namely Ian Gledhill's 2003 TutorEm with functional 9995 and 9918A emulation; it was very slow, very buggy, incomplete and Windows-only, but it really did work and finally opened the floodgates. Later that year MESS added a driver written by Raphael Nabet in 0.70 that I helped beta-test and it is still part of modern MAME. While I have since updated TutorEm and made many fixes for my tape-enabled Tutti II emulator, we'll use MAME for debugging this entry because it is currently the only Tutor emulator that handles cartridge ROMs.
<p>
Tutti didn't emulate the CPU because I didn't know how its I/O worked and it would have been impossible to execute code in any performant fashion on the C64; even the relatively lightweight 6502-on-6502 emulator I maintain for <a href="/2023/02/instruction-fusion-and-real-serial-port.html">the KIM-1 KIMplement emulator</a> runs about 30 times slower or so than actual. I had done a little playing around with TMS9900 assembly on the 99/4A using the Editor/Assembler cartridge ("module") on a friend's machine, and I even had a basic 9900 programming book, so the 9995 wasn't really an alien architecture to me &mdash; which makes a good transition into talking about the CPU itself.

The original TI-990 minicomputers supported multiprogramming in a then-innovative fashion: most of their registers were actually stored in RAM. The only CPU-internal registers are the program counter (PC), a Workspace Pointer (WP) that indicated where in RAM the 16 registers (32 bytes) reside, and a Status (ST) register for flags. This meant that a context switch could be as simple as merely changing the PC, WP and ST registers to those of the new task. Though zero or direct pages on CPUs like the 6502 or 6809 is a related concept, the 990 WP was more versatile and indeed absolutely intrinsic to how the 990 operated. It has a generally orthogonal instruction set for the time (<i>ceteris paribus</i>), and aside from R0 not being valid as an index the registers can be used for any general purpose, though certain instructions are fixed to specific registers like R11 as a link register for subroutine calls or R12 as the address for bit-serial I/O over the Communications Register Unit bus. Byte operations exist but all word accesses are aligned to even addresses.
<p>
For the TI 99/4 in 1979 (and later the 99/4A), TI determined that designing a full 16-bit system around the 9900 would have required new chips for its exclusively 16-bit bus, making the effort too expensive for a home computer. TI solved this problem by devising <a href="http://www.unige.ch/medecine/nouspikel/ti99/architec.htm">two buses</a>. The most directly connected 16-bit bus hosted the lowest level system ROM with the GPL interpreter plus 256 bytes of "scratchpad RAM" which could store eight complete sets of registers, composed of two 128-byte 8-bit static RAMs wired as low and high bytes (the 9900 is big-endian) which the CPU could access in parallel. SRAM was expensive, however, so the remainder of the machine's RAM was 16K of dynamic RAM given to the VDP, which has its own DRAM refresh circuitry. Unfortunately, although the VDP was on this 16-bit bus also, the VDP only supported byte accesses and ignores the lower half of the word, slowing DRAM reads further. Worse, everything else was behind the second "multiplexed" 8-bit bus, where a small circuit stalled out the CPU on reads until two 8-bit fetches could assemble the full 16 bits. While this meant less expensive 8-bit parts could be used, the cost reduction also cost a significant amount of performance.
<p>
The use of SRAM suggests that the 99/4 was originally intended to use a different chip that had RAM on-die, where refresh circuitry wouldn't have been needed, but cost and market considerations apparently prevailed. The intended CPU may have been something like the 1979 TMS9940 with an on-chip CRU, 2K of ROM, a decrementer and 128 bytes of SRAM, or the later TMS9985 with 8K of ROM and 256 bytes of scratchpad, though neither would have been ready in time for the 99/4. As mentioned earlier, after the disadvantages of the 9900's strict 16-bit data bus became more acute TI moved the multiplex circuitry on-chip and exposed only an 8-bit bus starting with the TMS9980 &mdash; but this also doubled access time to its external scratchpad RAM, condemning it to lower-performance applications <a href="/2022/09/what-kim-1-really-needs-is-bubble.html">like TI's Silent 700 teletypes</a>. TI's first attempt was to turn the 9940 into the 9985 by adding the same multiplexer and bumping up the ROM and scratchpad RAM, which were both internal and thus avoided the bus problem. There was reportedly no market appetite for the 9985, so TI removed the ROM and reduced instruction latency further by using prefetch steps in the microcode which could be parallel with a preceding ALU operation. This is the 9995, released in 1981.
<p>
(A digression: how do you use the 9900 to implement a language like C? The simplest method is to just implement a stack, which is facilitated on the 990/9900 by its support for post-increment addressing. This is in fact the approach taken by <a href="https://forums.atariage.com/topic/164295-gcc-for-the-ti/">the GCC port for the TMS9900</a>, which treats the CPU more or less like a modern CPU with a link register [usually R11], defines an ABI for arguments and volatile/non-volatile registers, and reserves one of the registers as the stack pointer, in this case R10. R10 is a 16-bit register like all the others, so the stack can be as large as the addressing space, a significant improvement over C-hostile architectures like the 6502. Another way is to go "full Berkeley" and treat the WP as a means to implement register windows, a la SPARC: the WP can be moved to any word-aligned address, so a caller can move the WP down a few notches, set up its arguments, call the routine, capture the return value and set it back. However, the 9995 &mdash; and for that matter the stock 99/4(A) &mdash; doesn't have CPU-addressable RAM other than the scratchpad, so in the base configuration neither system would have much capacity for function calls no matter how they were implemented. The Tomy BIOS gets around this by simply moving the WP or individual registers around by hand, which is space efficient, but also makes some individual routines or subsections more difficult to use because there is no standard calling convention.)
<p>
For our purposes, although the 9995 has a few extra instructions, we can treat it in practical terms as a faster 9900. The main difference at the assembly level is where the scratchpad RAM lives: since it's external to the 9900, its location is wherever it gets decoded (e.g., in the $8000 range in the 99/4A), but in the 9995 the internal RAM always occupies $f000-$f0fb (for compatibility with the 9900 the last four bytes are seen at $fffc to $ffff and serve as the NMI vector). The 9995 also has an internal decrementer at $fffa but we won't need to deal with that right now for this particular project. The only other concern is that the prefetch in the 9995 will affect self-modifying code if it changes the very next instruction which our example doesn't do either. Otherwise, programming it is almost completely the same.
<p>
The Tomy BIOS obviously has support routines for displaying text and reading the keyboard, but we're not going to use them for several reasons: first, I'm not particularly conversant in them, second, we can probably do it faster and more flexibly ourselves, third, it's good education, and fourth, they kind of suck. For input, while we can't do anything about the Tutor's mushy Chiclets or its single SHIFT key, we certainly can improve upon the BIOS' terrible key rollover. Additionally, the Tutor's default character set is inconveniently organized for modern applications: wile you can apparently use the <tt>SCELL()</tt> (the Tomy equivalent of TI <tt>CALL HCHAR</tt>) command to store characters by their ASCII value directly into VDP screen memory, this is in fact an artifact of BASIC and not actually how the glyphs are laid out in VDP RAM. We would like to organize our character set to be <em>exactly</em> the same as true ASCII so that no translation is needed, as well as support the 9918A's 40 column text mode which the Tutor BIOS never did. To do all of these things, we'll devise our own library.

The homebrew hardware we'll use is all from TeamEurope (hi Klaus!), who made one of the earliest Tutor flash multicarts. This is <a href="https://team-europe.blogspot.com/2023/12/tomy-tutorpyuta-ram-cartridge-updated.html">his newest unit</a> which is the only currently available CPU RAM expansion for the Tomy Tutor and Pyuuta, providing 16K of CPU-accessible RAM in two 8K ranges as well as multiple 32K ROMs accessible by DIP switch from a 512K flash ROM. (This cartridge was actually conceived of first by <a href="https://tms9918.hatenablog.com/entry/2018/01/18/211846">tanam</a>, but this unit is an expansion of that design.) We'll explore this device more in <a href="/search/label/tomy%20tutor">a future entry</a>. However, we don't need the RAM nor the extra ROM capacity today and the device additionally requires a passive I/O port adapter for those extra addressing lines, so we'll use one of his simpler items.

That simpler item is <a href="https://team-europe.blogspot.com/2019/05/flashcartsmulticarts-for-tomy.html">this one, his first</a>. It has every USA and Japanese cartridge ROM except the very rare USA and Japanese Demonstration cartridges &mdash; with a little luck I'm hoping to rectify that soon. It also lacks the later "3-D" series (a misnomer, they weren't 3D with the possible exception of <i>Rescue Copter</i>) which require the extra addressing line for 32K ROMs and are provided on a separate multicart.

The flash ROM itself is a socketed off-the-shelf 512K Microchip Technology SST39SF040. These chips are end-of-life but they're still inexpensive and easy to find as DIPs or PLCCs, and by using Klaus' board I don't need to make one of my own. For this I started with another DIP 39SF040 that I got cheaply since we won't need to do too many insertion cycles on the socket to get this simple program working. There is free space in the default cartridge loadout for four more 16K ROM images and we'll use two of them.

Pretty much any programmer will work for this. Since my daily driver is a POWER9 Linux workstation, I use the open-source <a href="https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/minipro">minipro</a> and this older XGecu TL866-II+ (minipro has experimental support for the newer T48 but the TL866-II+ is well-tested with it; unfortunately you can't trust many of the eBay and Amazon sellers to get you the older model). 
<p>
For the cross-assembler, we'll use <a href="http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/">the AS macroassembler</a>, which is multi-architecture, cross-platform, open-source and has specific support for the 9995. It builds just fine on any modern OS, including Linux and macOS. The macroassembler will create an intermediate object which we then link with an included tool into the final executable.
<p>
The Tomy machines place their VDP ports at $e000 and $e002 in the 9995's regular addressing space, while the keyboard and joy controllers (which share keyboard lines) are on the CRU bus at $ec00 through $ec70 with each group of eight lines separated by 16. The "little" 8K and "medium" 16K cartridges both are mapped to $8000-$bfff, where the Tutor expects to see two $55 bytes at $8000. If these two $55 bytes are present, the CARTRIDGE option is enabled in the menu, which triggers a jump to $8002. (There are other ways to signal its presence, but this method is the simplest and the one used by the majority of official Tomy cartridges.) So we'll start off with this:
<p>
<div class="tx"><pre>
        padding off

        ; vdp ports on the tutor
vdpwd   equ 0e000h
vdpwr   equ 0e002h
        ; CRU address for reading the keyboard
keycru  equ 0ec00h

        org 08000h

        ; cartridge signature word
        word 05555h
</pre></div>
<p>
The leading zeroes for these particular 16-bit values are a required quirk of AS. Since we're using all our own routines, we don't want any interference from the BIOS, so we'll turn off all interrupts by setting the interrupt mask to zero and load the WP with the lowest address of the 9995's built-in scratchpad RAM. (We'll have more to say about interrupts later.)
<p>
<div class="tx"><pre>
        limi 0
        lwpi 0f000h     ; don't even trust the Tomy OS here
</pre></div>
<p>
The Tomy Tutor BIOS gives us literally nothing to work with anyway: before the cartridge is started, the registers are set to default values and the entire VDP RAM is cleared. That means there's no screen matrix nor a character set, and we'll have to write them to VDP RAM ourselves. (The expectation is that you'd call the BIOS' own utility routines to set those up, and that's indeed what regular Tomy cartridges do, but we're not going to do that here.) To make working with the VDP a bit more convenient, we'll construct a little utility subroutine.
<p>
<div class="tx"><pre>
vdpr    ; write to VDP registers
        ; MSB of r0: command nybble + value (8r = register,
        ; 4x = MSB VDP RAM for write, 0x = for read)
        ; LSB of r0: new register value (xx) or LSB of VDP RAM address
        ; the swapping around gives enough time for the VDP to operate,
        ; and we have no IRQs on, so nothing will interfere
        swpb r0
        movb r0, @vdpwr
        swpb r0
        movb r0, @vdpwr
        b *r11
</pre></div>
<p>
Recall that the 9918A only has an eight-bit data bus, so we must communicate with it through byte-sized operations. This subroutine takes a single 16-bit argument in r0 that either encodes an absolute VDP RAM address for reading or writing, or encodes one of the eight VDP registers and the byte to store in it. (Because of the way these addresses are represented, i.e., either $4xxx to write or $0xxx to read, a "super 9918A" would need to implement some sort of bankswitching register to handle more than 16K. The only other supported RAM size for the 9918A is 4K.) The LSB goes out on the bus first and the 9995 is big-endian, so for each byte we swap them before sending it to the 9918A's control register, exiting back to the caller through r11 as our link register. As a happy convenience the swap operation takes just long enough for the 9918A to handle the bus transaction and be ready for the next. With that, we can set the following:
<p>
<div class="tx"><pre>
        ; register 0 turn off bitmap and external video
        li r0,08000h
        bl @vdpr
        ; register 1
        ; - 16K mode
        ; screen off
        ; no IRQs
        ; no 40 column text mode (except if we asked for it?)
        ; no multicolour
        ; no bit 5
        ; normal 8x8 sprites
        ; normal sized sprites
        li r0,08180h
        bl @vdpr
        ; register 2: put screen table at 0800h
        li r0,08202h
        bl @vdpr
        ; register 3: put colour table at 0c00h
        li r0,08330h
        bl @vdpr
        ; register 4: put character set at 0000h
        li r0,08400h
        bl @vdpr

        li r0,08500h

        li r0,08602h
        bl @vdpr

        ; (the only colours available for 40-column)
        li r0,087f2h
        bl @vdpr
</pre></div>
<p>
The locations for the screen table, colour table, character set, sprites and so forth are encoded as <a href="http://www.unige.ch/medecine/nouspikel/ti99/tms9918a.htm#Registers">multiples of particular alignments</a>. For our character set, we'll reorganize the Tutti one to match ASCII order (I told you we'd be coming back to that), add that to our binary and copy it in. We're only using positions 32-127, so there is plenty of space for expansion if we want to add graphics characters or an alternate font weight (for this purpose I just added a reverse/inverse set). Once we set the VDP memory address, we can just keep sending data to the data port as the VDP's address internally autoincrements with each write or read.
<p>
<div class="tx"><pre>
        ; load our font to >0000
        li r0,04000h
        bl @vdpr
        li r1,fontt
lup     movb *r1+,@vdpwd
        ci r1,fontt+00800h
        jne lup
</pre></div>
<p>
We go on to clear our screen in the same way (by storing the appropriate number of space characters starting from the top left of screen memory), then set the colour matrix (if 32 columns), print our character set and display a welcome message in similar fashion.
<p>
Next, we want to accept keyboard input and echo it to the user. Despite the rubbery nature of the keycaps themselves and their non-standard layout, the keyboard matrix proper is actually pretty good quality: each key independently sets a particular bit in the matrix and some quick tests show there's little to no shorting or ghosting. Reading it is a simple matter of requesting every key bit in groups of eight from the CRU at their specific addresses. However, like any keyboard handler, we'll need to properly debounce the keys, and this is where the Tomy BIOS is particularly bad: if you type too quickly and multiple keys are down as you transition from one keys to the next, the keyscan routine will fail to make a match and the new key will be dropped. This makes the Tutor's already somewhat mushy keyboard even worse to type on, an absolutely needless situation since the Tomy keyboard has all the <em>hardware</em> requirements to implement N-key rollover and is only let down by its <em>software</em>. The solution is to track each individual key bit using the debounce matrix to filter out key bits we already know were previously down. This is made a bit easier by the fact there's only one modifier key to watch (i.e., SHIFT), but the principles are the same.
<p>
<div class="tx"><pre>
        ; scan keyboard
        ; needs 16 bytes of scratchpad RAM

        mov r0,@keyzone+8

        mov r0,@keyzone+12
        mov r0,@keyzone+14

        ci r2,keyzone+8
        jne keezl
        ci r9,0
        jeq keezc               ; clear debounce if nothing pressed
</pre></div>
<p>
The "keyzone" block is our current matrix followed by the debounce matrix we'll use to filter it. This section can be entered either from <tt>keezc</tt> to blank the debounce matrix, falling through to <tt>keez</tt> to read it. Reading from the CRU requires placing the CRU address (a parallel addressing space) into R12 and asking for the needed number of bits. We fetch in groups of eight bits which are in eight locations stored 16 CRU bytes apart, keeping a running logical-OR (which the 9900/9995 atypically calls <tt>soc</tt>/<tt>socb</tt> "Set Ones Corresponding" for non-immediate arguments). If the value of the running logical-OR was zero, then no key was pressed, we branch back to clear the debounce, and go scan the matrix again.
<p>
The simplest case is where the current state of the matrix exactly equals the last time (modulo the state of the SHIFT key). This can be checked for by exclusive-ORing with the debounce matrix, masking off the SHIFT bit. We then logical-OR all the resulting bits together and if it's zero again, we go back to scanning &mdash; but leave the debounce matrix alone.
<p>
<div class="tx"><pre>
        mov @keyzone,r2
        mov @keyzone+2,r3
        mov @keyzone+4,r4
        mov @keyzone+6,r5
        xor @keyzone+8,r2       ; xor current bits with last set
        xor @keyzone+10,r3
        xor @keyzone+12,r4
        ; clear shift bit (prevent "eeking" characters when releasing)
        andi r5,0fbffh
        xor @keyzone+14,r5
        ; if exactly equal (i.e., all zeroes), go back

        soc r4,r2
        soc r5,r2
        jeq keez        ; don't clear debounce
</pre></div>
<p>
This is the block of code we'd use to set up key repeat, which as currently written this routine doesn't support yet (an exercise for the future). Otherwise, we need to filter the debounce to remove any keys that are now <em>up</em>, filter the new matrix to remove any keys already present in the debounce (which may give us another zero matrix again, but our keyscan table doesn't match an all zeroes matrix, so it's "fine"), and update the debounce matrix with the new bits that are down while clearing the SHIFT flag. This heavily uses the oddball <tt>szc</tt> instruction, which is an inverted logical-AND (though, like <tt>soc</tt> and <tt>ori</tt>, there is a regular immediate <tt>andi</tt> that is <em>not</em> inverted, a curious non-orthogonality in the instruction set). I won't show every store here but I'll give the overall flavour &mdash; there's probably a more efficient way to do it than I've done, but this is also pretty easy to follow conceptually:
<p>
<div class="tx"><pre>
        ; remove any bits in the debounce that aren't set currently
        mov @keyzone,r0
        inv r0
        szc r0,@keyzone+8       ; inverted and
        mov @keyzone+2,r0
        inv r0
        szc r0,@keyzone+10
[...]
        ; remove any bits in the new keyscan that were still set in debounce
        ; if we end up with a cleared keyscan, it doesn't matter since we
        ; won't be able to decode it anyway
        mov @keyzone,r0
        szc @keyzone+8,r0       ; inverted and
        mov r0,@keyzone
        mov @keyzone+2,r0
        szc @keyzone+10,r0
        mov r0,@keyzone+2
[...]
        ; update debounce, clearing shift
        ; add any new bits to debounce so they get masked off too
[...]
        mov @keyzone+4,r0
        soc @keyzone+12,r0
        mov r0,@keyzone+12
        mov @keyzone+6,r0
        soc @keyzone+14,r0
        andi r0,0fbffh
        mov r0,@keyzone+14
</pre></div>
<p>
Now with a clean set of keybits, we need to match them against a table. I organized a table of four words representing the eight matrix bytes in ASCII order so once you've found a matching set, the index into the table is the result. This table is stored at label <tt>keytab</tt> and looks like this:
<p>
<div class="tx"><pre>
[...]
        ; symbols and numbers, 32-64
        ; SPACE
        word 00000h, 00000h, 00000h, 08000h
        ; !
        word 00100h, 00000h, 00000h, 00400h
        ; "
        word 00200h, 00000h, 00000h, 00400h
        ; #
        word 00001h, 00000h, 00000h, 00400h
        ; $
        word 00002h, 00000h, 00000h, 00400h
[...]
</pre></div>
<p>
The Tutor does not have CONTROL or ALT keys, just SHIFT, nor does it have a backspace or delete. This lets us redefine our special keys (the cursor keys, MON and MOD) to generate indices in the control character range. Our table turns MOD into ^C (consistent with its use in Tomy BASIC as break), LEFT/UP/DOWN/RIGHT as ^H ^K ^M/CR ^L, RT (RETURN) as ^J/LF, and MOD as ^[/ESC. To round out other common ASCII points the default keyboard doesn't generate, ^I/TAB is encoded as SHIFT-SPACE, backtick as SHIFT-UP, tilde as SHIFT-DOWN and ^?/DEL as SHIFT-LEFT. The pipe and backslash characters remain represented by flat and degree/handaku, which have the same ASCII value. The only key our matrix table does not handle is LOCK, which would be <tt>word 00000h, 00000h, 00000h, 00200h</tt>. I'd probably implement this as a conventional CAPS LOCK defaulting to up but we'll exclude that from the logic for now. Anything not matched in the table gets a result of 0.
<p>
<div class="tx"><pre>
        ; decode key

</pre></div>
<p>
Like the debounce comparator, this code XORs the current matrix value against the current table entry; if it gets all zeroes, we have a match. At the end the resulting character code is in R6 and R0. Parenthetically, the 9900 has a <tt>inct</tt> instruction that increments by two instead of just one with regular <tt>inc</tt>, useful for skipping words (you can also use an instruction like <tt>c *r1+,*r1+</tt> to increment by four in one word).
<p>
Because we left the VDP memory pointer at the end of our "hello world" blurb, to print the character to the screen we could simply do <tt>swpb r0</tt> to get it in the upper byte followed by <tt>movb r0,@vdpwd</tt>. This doesn't scroll at the end as there's no bounds-checking, and remember the Tutor doesn't have a backspace (control characters are simply printed as blanks anyway), but it's really really fast. However, we also want to display a cursor for we'll use our reversed space character, so we'll keep a rolling screen pointer in R7. We'll additionally have RT clear the screen and as a convenience use MON to bail out to the Tomy title.
<p>
<div class="tx"><pre>
        ; check for mon - implemented as escape

        movb r0, @vdpwd

        ; and print cursor

        movb r0, @vdpwd
        b @keez
</pre></div>
<p>
The simplest way to go back to the title screen is to call the Tutor's reset vector, but paradoxically the 9900's built-in <tt>rset</tt> instruction is <em>not</em> what we want for this. There are a handful of TI-990 holdovers called <a href="https://www.unige.ch/medecine/nouspikel/ti99/tms9900.htm#External"><i>external instructions</i></a> which were used for special context switching operations, such as <tt>lrex</tt> to jump into front panel code. However, on the 9900/9995, most of the instructions with the possible exception of <tt>idle</tt> do nothing useful and in some cases could be potentially harmful depending on what's listening on the bus.
<p>
Instead, we'll use the low memory vectors. 9900 vectors consist of a pair of WP and PC words, with interrupt vectors starting at $0000. When an interrupt is triggered, or a vector is branched to using the <tt>blwp</tt> instruction, the WP and PC are loaded in order from those words (instantly saving the previous code's registers, assuming there is no conflict) and the previous values of WP, PC and ST are placed in the new R13, R14 and R15 respectively. The <tt>rtwp</tt> instruction then reverses everything using those registers and thus returns to the prior execution context. Theoretically the TMS9900 can support up to 16 levels of interrupt, starting at $0000 with level 0 for resets through $003c for level 15, though the 99/4 and 99/4A just wire everything to interrupt level 1. In the 9900 memory map these vectors are followed by XOP vectors for up to 16 software-defined opcodes via the <tt>xop</tt> family of instructions.
<p>
However, the 9995 only implements seven distinct interrupt levels, two of which are actually software interrupts (and one of those doesn't even work properly according to the manual errata). The highest level is level 0, connected to the reset pin, followed by the <tt>mid</tt> interrupt used for software opcodes, then NMIs, and then four numbered interrupts consisting of an external interrupt (1) on the INT1 pin, a not-reliably-functional arithmetic overflow interrupt (2), the on-chip decrementer (3) and another external interrupt (4) on INT2. These have their own vectors except for the MID interrupt and interrupt level 2 which share the same vector, and other than the NMI vector at $fffc all the rest come from low memory as well.
<p>
In this particular regard, the Tutor is no different from the 99/4A: a <tt>blwp 0</tt> will jump into the reset vector at $0000, just as if you'd powered the machine on and allowing you to go back to the menu. While the Tutor also uses the same reset vector values for levels 1 and 2, level 3 (the decrementer) runs normally to service its regular tasks and the level 4 (external INT2 triggered) interrupt is used for triggering on tape reads. On the other hand, the Tutor uses the entire XOP vector range as part of a jump table, so it isn't possible to use any XOP instructions on the Tutor with the standard ROMs (the 99/4A at least has <a href="http://www.unige.ch/medecine/nouspikel/ti99/tms9900.htm#XOP">a couple useful values there</a>). Anyway, all this is to say that a simple <tt>blwp 0</tt> will be sufficient.
<p>
That's pretty much it, and we're ready to assemble our first draft. I'll get to the code in a minute, but let's test it in MAME with <tt>mame tutor -skip_gameinfo -cart tello.rom</tt>. Our character set and welcome message appear beautifully though typing is a bit ... messy.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgVLyQPcgPH6ZXZ9ZFDym7RWkMe848NRoMs3r5VJ0KP3kBEfzZBYNVG2Brkv9l0kRYN03QhMsbrQhSpUVR8ITZQru19OMAX0UwT9vbtpBhPqniGTK_e60yppj8v6n8rlGz-x2ltkM4RNNvlwfvtpb6f97TKX13gaprTnMk6bY35iJ0TGJDQf_PhblGGgk4/s792/mame-joy.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="630" data-original-width="792" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgVLyQPcgPH6ZXZ9ZFDym7RWkMe848NRoMs3r5VJ0KP3kBEfzZBYNVG2Brkv9l0kRYN03QhMsbrQhSpUVR8ITZQru19OMAX0UwT9vbtpBhPqniGTK_e60yppj8v6n8rlGz-x2ltkM4RNNvlwfvtpb6f97TKX13gaprTnMk6bY35iJ0TGJDQf_PhblGGgk4/s320/mame-joy.png"/></a></div>

The problem isn't our code, it's MAME's default settings. You'll find the same mojibake occurs while typing in regular BASIC as well. I mentioned that the keyboard matrix is shared with the joy controller lines (though that's actually useful because it allows you to read some keys from GBASIC which wouldn't ordinarily permit this), and because MAME defines some keys for the controller, you can't type normally with the default keyboard settings. In my case, I have a Hyperkin Trooper 2 USB joystick I use for Tutor games because it has two buttons for SL and SR, so I removed the key equivalents for the joy controllers and set it to exclusively use the joystick. Now we can type normally.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjD_pri3erbef3eNg855yPlK1RenlRvirK2xW7vB0Njp5YQLbcdhVHdrs9eeEOQYkEhu3GxAvaMVHUVLX7EZLDoePUnoHstU3cmxMku0XWsVT5CPWk80T3-h9LgOiWemgOgadyxF3U2Bk-BIH_pmFhRvqYWUUaP0f5Kr4Z-JLliJz2pOpdkTTU30sQV95g/s792/mame32.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="630" data-original-width="792" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjD_pri3erbef3eNg855yPlK1RenlRvirK2xW7vB0Njp5YQLbcdhVHdrs9eeEOQYkEhu3GxAvaMVHUVLX7EZLDoePUnoHstU3cmxMku0XWsVT5CPWk80T3-h9LgOiWemgOgadyxF3U2Bk-BIH_pmFhRvqYWUUaP0f5Kr4Z-JLliJz2pOpdkTTU30sQV95g/s320/mame32.png"/></a></div>

And as hoped for, typing now flows beautifully. There is one more issue we need to solve, though:

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjO6ve2aurIKxK0yia2DJVsAsG0_-kAoD-JHj6ABaTZTD1nLgI58-huJw-zFymd14LlvtguZgJSqjc3amEkG2sf4dUvXPL_KYYksUJqbYazvRem-J73uBhbL9DhmyUk_N3nk0TGDi9ziLk1kQ1x8kYRXxscBJtLjh4PyNYbcGq0MBXOcQpPx5Cz-nT6Oko/s792/mame40-1.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="630" data-original-width="792" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjO6ve2aurIKxK0yia2DJVsAsG0_-kAoD-JHj6ABaTZTD1nLgI58-huJw-zFymd14LlvtguZgJSqjc3amEkG2sf4dUvXPL_KYYksUJqbYazvRem-J73uBhbL9DhmyUk_N3nk0TGDi9ziLk1kQ1x8kYRXxscBJtLjh4PyNYbcGq0MBXOcQpPx5Cz-nT6Oko/s320/mame40-1.png"/></a></div>

I mentioned we would like this to also support the 9918A's 40 column mode, something the Tutor BIOS doesn't but would be very useful for productivity applications (the Tutor has a lot of great games but it's time it achieved its potential, darn it). With a little tweaking we can turn on the 40 column bit in VDP register 1 and adjust our message and screen layout so everything ends up in the right place. However, the 9918A can't display a 320-pixel-wide screen, so instead it displays a 240-pixel-wide screen using only the leftmost six columns of each character cell. The cells are still eight bits wide in memory; the rightmost two are simply not displayed. This sort of works for some of the characters &mdash; lowercase in particular, which makes me wonder if this was a consideration during the Tutor's development &mdash; but clearly doesn't for others.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh9Dx99AZy6ioIU-yIIt8TpypSiS3gz91djNdAJcjSQ8GoW6bjk_GvAOvjjMfV70J7VlvhlYx1s5y_ampInfslL-nFgF-sqdU35uluexLcOkTHB4u2ymSVd1K2U1xe0WpNyA5yo3u4lCF6GiyF5kg5OI6vWNGVvpdHKDgq5nFSnSLpMc_g9JhKVkZESxFA/s743/ultrafont.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" height="320" data-original-height="743" data-original-width="728" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh9Dx99AZy6ioIU-yIIt8TpypSiS3gz91djNdAJcjSQ8GoW6bjk_GvAOvjjMfV70J7VlvhlYx1s5y_ampInfslL-nFgF-sqdU35uluexLcOkTHB4u2ymSVd1K2U1xe0WpNyA5yo3u4lCF6GiyF5kg5OI6vWNGVvpdHKDgq5nFSnSLpMc_g9JhKVkZESxFA/s320/ultrafont.png"/></a></div>

Since the font started as a Commodore 64 character set, after all, we'll go back into <a href="https://commodore.software/downloads/download/40-font-character-editors/2897-ultrafont-v-2">Ultrafont+</a> and start shrinking them down, leaving a bit of gutter space.

I think we're ready to try it on the real thing!
<p>
I used minipro to dump the current contents of the multicart ROM and wrote up a little Perl script to do an inplace overwrite on the resulting file with our new binaries. We generate two ROM files called <tt>tello.rom</tt> (32 column) and <tt>tello40.rom</tt> (40 column), which we splice in at locations 0x70000 and 0x74000 and then burn it to flash.

<p>
The multicart DIP settings for the 32-column version are (1=on) 00011 if you use those addresses. The first time I tried, the hello message appeared but typing generated no output. This was because I had a <tt>mov r0,@vdpwd</tt> instead of <tt>movb r0,@vdpwd</tt>; MAME will accept either instruction but not a real Tutor. With that corrected, we're in business!

These are real composite video captures from my real Tutor. Hurray! We did it!
<p>
Now, what things could you do with better keyboard support, true ASCII and fast character display? Well, obviously this whole proof of concept is the start of doing something more practical with the Tutor. <a href="/search/label/tomy%20tutor">I'll answer that question in a couple months</a> once all the parts arrive. The first order of business will be installing a PLCC adapter in the multicart so I don't have to pull the flash chip out repeatedly for testing.

Let's briefly finish our Tutor story. There are in fact two other members of the Tutor/Pyuuta family, both domestic to Japan: the Pyuuta Jr., a game console that came out between the Pyuuta and Tutor that implemented GRAPHIC mode (but no GBASIC) and could play most cartridges &mdash; but was entirely in English with no katakana support at all &mdash; and this, the last and final Tutor, the Pyuuta Mark II (variously Pyuuta mk II and Mark II). The mk II had proper keycaps with a rearranged layout and used the American Tutor BIOS instead of the Pyuuta's, with Tomy BASIC (also the same as the American Tutor's version) available as an add-on cartridge. Notably, neither system supported a composite monitor, only RF TV output, though they're pretty easy to comp-mod. Both systems have slight hardware differences from the Pyuuta and Tutor but both will run all the same cartridge games, and they also don't require special hardware for 32K cartridges. Unfortunately, their English-only nature probably didn't endear them to their home markets and the mk II can't load Pyuuta tapes either (only US Tutor ones). Likely as a result, both sold poorly, and Tomy exited the home computer market as well in 1984.
<p>
As for the 9995, in the end it was only ever implemented in three systems: the Tutor/Pyuuta family, a PEB upgrade called the Myarc Geneve 9640 which was basically a new TI-compatible computer on a card, and the <a href="http://powertrancortex.com/">Powertran Cortex</a>, a home and business computer first built at TI in the United Kingdom that never got released due to internal squabbles. Instead, its plans were published in the Electronics Today International magazine and a company called Powertran Cybernetics sold kits and fully assembled machines. The Cortex ran at a full 3MHz, had 64K of chip RAM (with a memory mapper supporting up to 1MB) and used a 16K PAL equivalent 9928/29 VDP for graphics, though the more advanced Yamaha/Maplin V9938 could also be substituted with up to 128K of VRAM. Floppy, serial and DMA were all supported along with a built-in BASIC and multiple operating system options, even a small <a href="http://www.stuartconner.me.uk/mini_cortex/mini_cortex.htm#using_unix">v6 UNIX port called LSX</a>. Although popular with enthusiasts, it was an obscure system then and now, and relatively few examples remain in operation.
<p>
While the 9995 was a much more tractable chip than its ancestors, the reliance of the 9900 series on RAM was what eventually stunted its technological evolution. In the days when it was taped out, CPU die space was expensive, so shifting register space onto cheaper RAM which often ran at a similar speed was a logical alternative. Indeed, tricks like 6502/6800 zero page are the same basic idea, using a special expanse of memory with faster access and special addressing as if it were CPU registers itself. As CPUs became substantially faster than memory, however, this architectural quirk became more of a liability and contemporary 16-bit CPUs like the Motorola 68000 and the Intel 8086 and 80286 eclipsed it. A chip like the 6502 only got away with it for as long as it did because it was incredibly cheap and incredibly common and even today still sells in quantity, neither advantage being one the 9900 or 9995 ever possessed. Today, modern CPUs have comparatively massive register files and caches as proof that the 9900 idea was a dead end. After the 99000 family, an upgraded 9900 with segmented memory only used in TI's last range of minicomputers, TI abandoned further development of the architecture in 1983 for the TMS320 DSP series and the exceptionally swift TMS32010, a much more popular (and, especially for a DSP, more conventional) processor.

## Biden to Host Japan PM Kishida, Philippines President Marcos

date: 2024-03-19, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden will host Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. for a White House summit next month amid growing concerns about North Korea's nuclear program, provocative Chinese action in the South China Sea and differences over a Japanese company's plan to buy an iconic American steel company.


White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in a statement on Monday said the first-ever U.S.-Japan-Philippines leaders' summit is an opportunity to highlight the countries' "growing economic relations, a proud and resolute commitment to shared democratic values and a shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific."


The three leaders have no shortage of issues to discuss.


The announcement came as North Korea's state media reported that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a live-fire drill of nuclear-capable "super-large" multiple rocket launchers designed to target South Korea's capital. The North Korean claim followed the South Korean and Japanese militaries reporting on Monday that they had detected North Korea firing multiple short-range ballistic missiles toward waters off its eastern coast, adding to a streak of weapons displays that have raised regional tensions.


The U.S.-Japan relationship is facing a rare moment of friction after Biden announced last week that he opposes the planned sale of Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel of Japan. Biden argued in announcing his opposition that the U.S. needs to "maintain strong American steel companies powered by American steelworkers."


Nippon Steel announced in December that it planned to buy U.S. Steel for $14.1 billion in cash, raising concerns about what the transaction could mean for unionized workers, supply chains and U.S. national security.


Meanwhile, long-running Philippines-Chinese tensions have come back into focus this month after Chinese and Philippine coast guard vessels collided in the disputed South China Sea.


The Chinese coast guard ships and accompanying vessels blocked the Philippine coast guard and supply vessels off the disputed Second Thomas Shoal and executed dangerous maneuvers that caused two minor collisions between the Chinese ships and two of the Philippine vessels, Philippine officials said.


A small Philippine marine and navy contingent has kept watch onboard a rusting warship, the BRP Sierra Madre, which has been marooned since the late 1990s in the shallows of the Second Thomas Shoal.


China also claims the shoal lying off the western Philippines and has surrounded the atoll with coast guard, navy and other ships to press its claims and prevent Filipino forces from delivering construction materials to fortify the Sierra Madre in a decades-long standoff.


Close U.S.-Philippines relations were not a given when Marcos, the son and namesake of the former Philippines strongman, took office in 2022.


But both Biden and Marcos have thrown much effort into strengthening the historically- complicated relationship between the two countries, with the two leaders sharing concerns about aggressive Chinese action around the region.


A U.S. appeals court in 1996 upheld damages of about $2 billion against the elder Marcos' estate for the torture and killings of thousands of Filipinos. The court upheld a 1994 verdict of a jury in Hawaii, where he fled after being forced from power in 1986. He died there in 1989.


The elder Marcos placed the Philippines under martial law in 1972, a year before his term was to expire. He padlocked the country's congressional and newspaper offices, ordered the arrest of many political opponents and activists and ruled by decree.


The younger Marcos made an official visit to Washington last year, the first by a Philippine president in more than 10 years. The U.S. made the announcement of Marcos' coming trip to Washington as Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Manilla.


Jean-Pierre said that in addition to the leaders' summit Biden will hold one-on-one talks with Marcos. She said the leaders would discuss efforts to expand cooperation on economic security, clean energy, people-to-people ties, human rights and democracy.


Biden is set to honor Kishida a day before the leaders summit with a state visit. The White House announced the state visit in January.

## Q&A: TikTok Owner Is Essentially 'Subsidiary' of China's Communist Party, US Lawmaker Says

date: 2024-03-19, from: VOA News USA

washington — The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill March 13 that, if enacted into law, would give ByteDance, the Chinese owner of the TikTok social media app, 180 days to divest its U.S. assets or face a ban over concerns about national security, including Beijing's ability to access Americans' private information through the company


ByteDance denies it would provide such private data to the Chinese government, despite reports indicating such information could be at risk.


VOA sat down on the day the bill passed with Republican Representative Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on state, foreign operations and related programs, and co-chair of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus, to hear why he supported the bill and why he's calling for faster military support for Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing claims as a breakaway province that must one day reunite with the mainland, by force if necessary.


This year marks the 45th anniversary of Congress' enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act, which outlines nondiplomatic relations between Washington and Taipei in the wake of formal U.S. recognition of Beijing as the government of China. The act states that the U.S. must provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.


This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.


VOA: The House just passed a bill that would require ByteDance to divest TikTok. Did you support this bill?


U.S. Representative Mario Diaz-Balart: I absolutely did. … It has strong bipartisan support. And there's also been a lot of misinformation about it. People say that it's to ban TikTok. No, it's basically saying you have to divest from, in essence, being controlled by the Communist Party of China.


We would have never allowed, during the Soviet empire, the Soviet Union to control, to own, one of the major networks in the United States - ABC, NBC, CBS. Why? Because it's a threat to national security. In this case, it's even more dramatic because they [the Chinese] have access not only to getting into people's homes, but to actually get information from the American people. And they've been pretty good and very aggressive at doing that. And so TikTok needs to be divested. That's the least that we should be requiring, and if so, then they can continue to function. But we cannot allow for this to function, getting information from the American people to an entity that is in essence a subsidiary of the Communist Party of China.


VOA: It is a consensus in Washington that if China invaded Taiwan, it would trigger a domino effect that could be catastrophic for the U.S. What are the most important actions the U.S. can take right now to prevent that from happening?


Diaz-Balart:  The key is to avoid China doing something stupid, to avoid China being irresponsible in trying to intervene militarily with Taiwan. … And the way to do that is to make sure that Taiwan has the weaponry, everything it needs, so that China understands that trying to invade Taiwan is a very, very bad proposition.


VOA: The Biden administration last month approved a package of military equipment sales to Taiwan. Some analysts are worried this may not be sufficient to counter China's aggression in the region. Do you think military sales to Taiwan are sufficient?


Diaz-Balart: I think military sales to Taiwan have to be done quicker. We have to be more aggressive … not only, obviously, directly, to help send the weaponry, sell the weaponry, and send the weaponry to Taiwan, but we also have to keep up with our defense spending domestically to keep the military industrial base alive and, well, with what we've seen, for example, going on Ukraine, [that] has demonstrated that we're not where we need to be as far as our industrial base.


VOA: You visited Taiwan in January right after its election. What is your key takeaway from that trip?


Diaz-Balart: Taiwan is a very vigorous democracy. The press is very aggressive. That's a good thing. ... We made a point of obviously visiting with the president and the vice president-elect, also with the outgoing president. But we also met with the leadership of the other two parties, because it's important to demonstrate that we cherish and that we love democracy and freedom. Taiwan is a beacon of freedom and democracy.


VOA: It is the bipartisan consensus to see China as one of the biggest geopolitical challenges for the U.S. in the coming decades. What should be the top priority the U.S. should tackle right now with China?


 




Diaz-Balart: We have to be a little bit more serious about understanding that China is a very dangerous player in the world. It is the largest fascist dictatorship on the planet, and the wealthiest fascist dictatorship on the planet. It has very ambitious goals. It has, you know, we see the cyberattacks that have taken place in this country that we know have come from Communist China. We also know that there have been thousands upon thousands of men, military-age males, coming from China across the southern border, which should frankly frighten all of us. …


That means utilizing every diplomatic and economic tool at our disposal to treat China as what it is: a growing threat to the United States and to the world. And you see, for example, in the region, how countries are very concerned about China's aggressiveness, whether it's the Philippines or India or even Vietnam. So there's a growing concern in the world about this aggressive attitude of China. But we need to take real steps to confront that in a way to avoid war.


VOA: You're also the chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on state, foreign operations and related programs. What kind of role would you like to see U.S. international broadcasting agencies like Voice of America play in countering Chinese Communist Party propaganda?


Diaz-Balart: The Voice of America has been a key player for decades in that cause of freedom and in getting real news, real information to people who don't have access to it because of censorship. And so I've always been a strong supporter of it because of that. I think information is key. The first thing that happens in a dictatorship is that they close the ability for people to get real information, to get real news. And if we can be helpful to have people around the world get real information, real news, not only about what happens around the world but also what even happens in their own country, I think that is a service to humanity.

## Austin Hosts First In-Person Ukraine Defense Contact Group of 2024

date: 2024-03-19, from: VOA News USA

Ramstein, Germany — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Tuesday that “Russia has paid a staggering cost” for President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine, as a U.S.-led group of more than 50 nations met in Germany to coordinate their efforts to support Ukraine.


“Ukraine's troops face harsh conditions and hard fighting, and Ukraine's civilians endure a constant barrage of Russian missiles and Iranian drones,” Austin said as he opened the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) talks. “But Ukraine won't back down, and neither will the United States. So our message today is clear: The United States will not let Ukraine fail. This coalition will not let Ukraine fail. And the free world will not let Ukraine fail."


Austin highlighted new aid packages from the Czech Republic, Germany, France, Denmark and Sweden, calling them "investments in Ukraine's just battle against Russian aggression" as well as global security.


"Ukraine's survival is on the line, and all of our security is on the line,” Austin said.


While Ukrainian forces have continued to fight back against Russian forces in the east and inflicted “considerable damage” to Russian forces in the Black Sea, Russia — with the help of North Korea and Iran — has drastically ramped up its defense production capacity, forcing Ukraine to retreat from some battles due to ammunition shortages, according to a senior defense official, who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity ahead of the UDCG.


“Ukraine is heavily outgunned on the battlefield. We've received reports of Ukrainian troops rationing or even running out of ammunition on the front lines,” said the official.


The U.S. has contributed about $44 billion in security assistance for Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in February 2022, with allies and partners also committing more than $44 billion in that time frame.


But the U.S. military has run out of congressionally approved funds for replenishing its weapons stockpiles sent to Ukraine, and leadership in the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives has so far refused to bring new aid for Ukraine up for a vote.


Last week, the United States announced its first new round of military aid for Ukraine since late December, in what defense officials have called an “ad hoc” package made possible through U.S. Army procurement savings.


The military assistance package is valued at up to $300 million and will provide Ukraine with immediate air defense, artillery and anti-tank capabilities, along with more ammunition for HIMARS and 155-mm artillery rounds. But officials say it is unclear if there will be future procurement savings to produce another extraordinary package of aid.


“This is not a sustainable solution for Ukraine. We urgently need congressional approval of a national security supplemental,” the senior defense official said.


“There isn't a way that our allies can really combine forces to make up for the lack of U.S. support,” the official added.


The emphasis on ammunition and air defense will likely be as strong as ever during this UDCG meeting.


“They need interceptors for a whole variety of their air defense systems, and over time, they keep running out as they try to defend against these wave upon wave of attacks that we're seeing from Russia,” the senior official said.


Coalition leadership group


To better organize how the UDCG provides Kyiv with military weapons and equipment, the group’s members have formed capability coalitions to identify ways to increase Kyiv’s efficiency and cut costs.    


Austin convened a meeting of the leads and co-leads of all the capability coalitions for the first time Tuesday, during a special coalition leadership group session.  



Air Force capability is co-led by the United States, Denmark and the Netherlands. The armor capability is co-led by Poland and Italy. The artillery capability is co-led by France and the United States. De-mining is co-led by Lithuania and Iceland. Drone capability is co-led by Latvia and the United Kingdom. Information technology is co-led by Estonia and Luxembourg. Integrated air and missile defense capabilities are co-led by Germany and France, and maritime security is co-led by the United Kingdom and Norway.


 


Critics like Sean McFate, a professor at Syracuse University and author of “The New Rules of War,” told VOA the international community is putting its money into expensive military aid that falls short in modern warfare.


“It's not conventional warfare that beat back Russia's blitz. It was Ukrainian guerrilla warfare,” he said. “Ukraine was winning the unconventional fight. But then in fall of 2022, they decided to go conventional against Russia, which was strategically silly.”


McFate added that giving Ukraine more conventional war weapons was, in his view, “the strategic definition of insanity.”


Instead, he said Ukraine and its allies needed to think about unconventional ways where they can leverage their power to defeat Russia, such as guerilla operations and more direct actions deep inside Russia to build upon the Russian population’s unfavorable opinions of the war.


“Use your conventional forces to hold the line, but don't invest them to create an offensive which requires a lot more resources,” McFate told VOA.


“M1A1 Abram tanks and F-16 fighter jets … will win tactical victories on the battlefield, but we all know that you can win every battle, yet lose the war, because wars are won on the strategic level, not at the tactical level of warfare,” he said.

## VOA Interview: US Says North Korea Shipped 10,000 Containers of Munitions to Russia

date: 2024-03-19, from: VOA News USA

STATE DEPARTMENT — The United States disclosed Monday that North Korea has dispatched at least 10,000 containers loaded with military munitions to Russia in support of its war in Ukraine. This number surpasses the 7,000 containers estimated by the South Korean defense chief earlier in the day.


Jung Pak, the U.S. Senior Official for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), told VOA on Monday that there have been at least 10 instances where North Korean missiles have been used on the battlefield in Ukraine.


She expressed deep concern about the increasing ties between Russia, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and the DPRK.


Earlier on Monday, North Korea launched several ballistic missiles into the sea for the first time in two months, as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Seoul for the Summit for Democracy hosted by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol.


Despite these "unfortunate" and "concerning" developments, Pak told VOA the U.S. still assesses North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is not currently planning an imminent attack on Washington’s allies, South Korea and Japan.


The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.




VOA: North Korea has fired several ballistic missiles at a time when South Korea is hosting the Summit for Democracy, and a few days after the U.S. and South Korea finished their military exercises. Do you still believe that a direct attack from North Korea against Japan and South Korea is not imminent?


Jung Pak, U.S. Senior Official for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea: I still do. Ballistic missile launches are something that the DPRK has been doing: 69 in 2022, several dozen last year. And this is their latest set of launches. And it was unfortunate that they did it when the secretary was in Seoul for the Summit for Democracy.


We still assess that DPRK’s leader, Kim Jong Un, is not looking at an imminent attack or near-term attack. I think Kim Jong Un probably knows what that would likely mean in response. But we are very concerned about the level of activity, weapons advancements, and the increasing alignment with Russia over the past couple of years.


VOA: Just to clarify, does the U.S. not see any signs of North Korea planning some form of lethal military action against South Korea in the coming months?


Pak: We're always on the lookout for any kind of dangerous activities. But I'll also point out that these ballistic missile tests, various cruise missile tests, and this hostile rhetoric coming out of the DPRK, are of great concern to us. Regardless, we're going to keep trying to see where we can engage with the DPRK, because diplomacy is the only way that we can get a sustained peace on the peninsula and discuss the issue of denuclearization.


VOA: Also on Monday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un congratulated Russian President Vladimir Putin for his reelection. Meanwhile, South Korea’s defense chief says North Korea has supplied 7,000 containers filled with munitions to Russia. Can you talk about the closer ties between Moscow and Pyongyang?


Pak: It's been a very concerning development to have a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council openly flout the Security Council resolutions that it signed up to, along with the rest of the international community, and that they're engaging in weapons transfers. We know that there have been at least 10,000 containers that have gone from DPRK to Russia. And DPRK is not doing this for free. There are almost certainly things that DPRK wants in return. And we're concerned about what might be going to the other side.


We also worry about what the DPRK could be learning from Russia's use of these weapons and ballistic missiles on the battlefield, and how that might embolden and/or help the DPRK even further advance their weapons program. So, this is a really dangerous time.


VOA: Does the U.S. see new evidence that more ballistic missiles provided by North Korea to Russia have been fired at targets in Ukraine since 2024?


Pak: Yes, this is of course concerning to us, that we have a known proliferator in the DPRK selling weapons to Russia, and to be able to conduct their unlawful brutal attack on Ukraine, killing Ukrainian people, destroying Ukraine infrastructure, and just destroying lives. And so, we're very much concerned about that.


There have been at least 10 instances where the DPRK missiles have been used on the battlefield. So, we're absolutely concerned about what that means for proliferation going forward, and how this exacerbates the situation.


VOA: Does the U.S. see further evidence that Russia has agreed to and is helping North Korea with nuclear-capable missiles?


Pak: We think the DPRK is probably looking for ballistic missile technologies, or other advanced technologies, or surface-to-air missiles, or armored vehicles. We've observed a significant increase in exchanges across military, leadership, economic, and cultural levels. So, it's pretty apparent that the two sides are getting closer and closer together.


VOA: You have said there would have to be interim steps toward ultimate denuclearization. Can you please elaborate on that? Is having “interim steps” to denuclearizing North Korea an official U.S. government policy?


Pak: Our policy is the same since we rolled out our policy review back in the spring of 2021, which is that we are absolutely looking for the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. And so that goal has not wavered for us at all.


When we talk about “interim steps,” we're making explicit what has always been implicit: which is a complete denuclearization will not occur overnight. So, there are valuable discussions that we can have with the DPRK on reducing the potential for military risk, and other substantive discussions as we work toward complete denuclearization.


VOA: Isn’t it a departure from seeking complete denuclearization?


Pak: It is not a departure. As I mentioned, this is not something that's going to happen overnight. There are going to have to be substantial discussions that will need to take place.
