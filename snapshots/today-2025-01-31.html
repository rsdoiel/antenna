<h2>
A quarterly column from Carrie Brownstein, who is better at dispensing
advice than taking it.
</h2>
<p>
<span class="dropcap">Q:</span> <i>What is an appropriate amount of time
to stay at your friend’s art show if you’re not interested in the social
aspect of that kind of thing? I’m all about showing up to support
people, but I find the conversations at these events so tedious and
performative. And I hate who these events make me become: I find myself
trying to fit in, while also judging my friends, who are all of a sudden
talking differently and putting on airs. Should I just suffer through
them?</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>JD<br /> Los Angeles, CA</i>
</p>
<p>
<span class="dropcap">A:</span> I went to college in a small town where
we had to make our own fun. Lots of what we did was reimagine and
emulate big-city functions like art openings, musicals, and fashion
shows. Our events were scrappy, shambolic, and wonderful. They worked
because we intentionally aimed for gilded and saw no value in actual
gold. But when there’s a lack of self-awareness, these gatherings can
feel performative and contrived. That being said, I now live in a
medium-sized city, and the last time I attended one of these events, and
felt my skin begin to crawl when confronted with a mid-Atlantic accent
and Truman Capote cosplay, I started to think that maybe everyone—even
in New York or Paris or London—is simply acting out an idea of what it
means to be a partygoer or an art aficionado or an intellectual. So what
is the appropriate amount of time to stay at your friend’s art show?
However long you can stand to pretend along with the other fakers.
</p>
<div class="break">
<ul>
<li><ul>

</div>
<p>
<span class="dropcap">Q:</span> <i>I’ve gone on a number of art museum
dates, but I’m not sure how good of an idea they are. They’re starting
to feel like screening tests that invariably detect a problem. On one
occasion, I was with someone I seemed to have a lot in common with, but
we ended up clashing over most of the canvases—he saw laziness where I
saw fleeting beauty; he saw bold defiance where I saw petulant
rebellion. It got so tense that we ended up leaving early.
</p>
<p>
Another time, my date paused at nearly every painting to say something
like “This painting is so me!” She projected herself onto everything,
from portraits to landscapes, relating each one back to herself. Her
constant self-comparison gave me the ick, and I decided to call things
off.
</p>
<p>
These experiences have me wondering if the art museum brings out the
worst in my dates, or in me. Should I stop taking future dates there, or
is this actually a good way to gauge someone’s character?</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Jess<br /> Chicago, IL</i>
</p>
<p>
<span class="dropcap">A:</span> Clashing over art should not be a
deal-breaker, as long as there is mutual respect in both delivery and
intent, a willingness to entertain opposing views, and perhaps the
concession that a right or wrong interpretation is beside the point. On
the other hand, “This painting is so me!” is an absolute deal-breaker
and your reaction was entirely appropriate. (At the very least, you’ve
spared yourself from ever having to hear the words, “This breakup is so
me!”)
</p>
<p>
As to your question, I do wonder if museum-going is best left for
further along in a potential relationship. While gently sparring over a
painting or sculpture can be stimulating, it can be irksome too. Also
irritating, I would think, is the constant affirmation and parroting of
our own views. Plus, you need to be wary of the mutual desire to
establish common interests early on, often while obfuscating more
nuanced or even contrary predilections. And while you posit museum-going
as a test of character, perhaps you’re simply struggling with the
age-old quandary of whether opposites attract or if shared interests
prevail. Or, to be less trite, maybe you deem yourself someone with good
taste and are thus looking for someone else with good (i.e., your own)
taste. No shame there! I probably wouldn’t date anyone who’d never heard
of Poly Styrene or Elaine May.
</p>
<p>
So might I suggest a deeper examination of what you’re looking for when
you say “character.” My hunch is you could replace “museum” with just
about any context, and face the same conundrum: finding a romantic
partner, someone who really sees you and loves you for who you are, is
really, really hard. It’s often easier to look for faults and reasons
not to try. Therefore, maybe gauging good character is less about how a
date responds to David Wojnarowicz and more about how vulnerable, silly,
sexy, gross, smart, and just plain stupid you can be with someone, and
finding someone who can be those same things around you. No judgment, no
ridicule. A person you can trust not only with your excellent taste in
culture, but with your heart. If art matters to you, witness it with
someone who matters to you as well. Sigh. This answer is so me! (I’ll
show myself out.)

<h2 id="an-oral-history-of-the-kidz-bop-cover-of-john-cages-433">An Oral
History of the Kidz Bop Cover of John Cage’s 4′33″</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: McSweeney’s Internet Tendency</p>
<h4>
Part One: The Kidz
</h4>
<p>
<strong>Dana Wilkinson, <i>Kidz Bop Producer</i>:</strong> People don’t
remember this, but there was a draft in the early 2000s. We’d show up at
some third-grader’s door, and they could only bring one duffle bag and a
handful of their homeland’s soil with them. We called them the Kidz
Korp.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Eileen Atwater, <i>Kidz Bop Kid</i>:</strong> The Kidz Korp was
run by Irving “Big Irv” Schopenhauer, who was a studio exec from the
1940s.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Harry Collins, <i>Kidz Bop Kid</i>:</strong> Big Irv was strict
but fair. We could only eat cat food and cigarettes, but we could have
all the cat food and cigarettes we wanted.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mike “Fancy Feast” Lewis, <i>Kidz Bop Kid</i> [<i>archival
interview</i>]:</strong> We all ate the cat food. I don’t know why I’m
the only one who got the nickname Fancy Feast… I’ll die a happy man if
no one ever calls me Fancy Feast again.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Ed. note: Mike “Fancy Feast” Lewis was killed in 2014 when his
tanning bed fused shut and burst into flames.</i>]
</p>
<p>
<strong>Harry Collins:</strong> Fancy Feast said that? Crazy.
</p>
<h4>
Part Two: The Piece
</h4>
<p>
<strong>Eileen Atwater:</strong> The whole idea behind John Cage’s
<i>4′33″</i> was that the sounds of everyday life were just as
interesting and engaging as those in a traditional piece of classical
music.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Harry Collins:</strong> He wanted you to listen to the sounds
you usually ignore. Like people breathing and birds chirping. I wasn’t
all that excited about it, but they kept telling us that if we didn’t do
what they said, they’d sell us to Randy Quaid, and he’d hunt us for
sport. So yeah, we fell in line.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Harvey Roth:</strong> We were all terrified of Randy Quaid. The
only movie they let us watch was <i>Caddyshack II</i>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Irving “Big Irv” Schopenhauer [<i>archival
interview</i>]:</strong> Well, ah, in the original piece, it’s mostly
people fidgeting and coughing and stuff. It wasn’t very kid-oriented. So
we thought, why not get a clown and let him do this thing? Then, we’ll
get audio of the kids in the audience reacting.
</p>
<h4>
Part Three: Showtime
</h4>
<p>
<strong>Dana Wilkinson:</strong> I don’t know where they found that
fucking clown. I think they paid him in cough syrup.
</p>
<p>
<i>When the piece begins, the first sounds you can hear are some
tentative giggles. Then, about forty-five seconds in, you hear Eileen
Atwater’s distinctive gasp.</i>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Eileen Atwater:</strong> People still recognize me, “Oh, are you
the little girl who gasps in <i>4′33″</i>?” What they don’t know is that
I gasped because the clown was trying to balance on a skateboard while
holding two lit torches, and I guess I was the only one who saw it
coming.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Harry Collins:</strong> The clown was juggling fire. We all knew
that was [record executive] Al Hirschfield’s idea, because Al
Hirschfield had a saying: “If a little fire is good, a lot of fire must
be great!” Poor guy. No one ever explained fire to him, I guess.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dana Wilkinson:</strong> Al Hirschfield? He was killed in 2014
when his tanning bed fused shut and burst into flames.
</p>
<p>
<i>In a cough-syrup-induced haze, the clown drops one of the torches.
The curtains immediately ignite. That’s when the kids start
screaming.</i>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mike “Fancy Feast” Lewis [<i>archival interview</i>]:</strong>
The first wave of screams is playful, like maybe it was all planned. I
don’t know; I was six, and I hadn’t slept in three months. I was
hallucinating that my blood was alive and trying to escape out of my
feet. I later found out I had mercury poisoning from all the cat food we
were eating.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dana Wilkinson:</strong> The curtains went up in flames, and the
kids were stampeding toward the exit. I tried to throw some of the cat
litter from the kids’ litter boxes on the clown, but I think he was
already dead by that point.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Al Hirschfield [<i>archival interview</i>]:</strong> The only
people who didn’t flee were me and Big Irv. He just kept screaming,
“Keep rolling! Keep rolling!” That’s mostly what you hear in the
finished recording: him yelling and me chanting the Mourner’s Kaddish
for the clown.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dana Wilkinson:</strong> Listen, if you’re gonna cry about every
clown that dies during a Kidz Bop recording session, you’ll never get
anything done. I learned that on my first day on the job.
</p>
<h4>
Part Four: The Legacy
</h4>
<p>
<strong>Eileen Atwater:</strong> It’s nice that it’s had such an impact
over the years.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Harry Collins:</strong> People come up to me all the time and
are like, “Is it true you watched a clown burn to death, and they
recorded it for a Kidz Bop album?” No one ever believes that to us, it
was just another Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mike “Fancy Feast” Lewis [<i>archival interview</i>]:</strong> I
can’t listen to it anymore. It just makes me crave cat food.
</p>
<p>
<i>Editor’s Note: </i>4′33″<i> composer John Cage passed away in 1992
when his tanning bed fused shut and burst into flames. His estate has
formally denounced the Kidz Korp.</i>

<h2 id="the-surprising-way-to-save-memory-with-bytesio">The surprising
way to save memory with BytesIO</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, updated: 2025-01-31, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://pythonspeed.com/articles/bytesio-reduce-memory-usage/">The
surprising way to save memory with BytesIO</a></strong>
</p>
Itamar Turner-Trauring explains that if you have a <code>BytesIO</code>
object in Python calling <code>.read()</code> on it will create a full
copy of that object, doubling the amount of memory used - but calling
<code>.getvalue()</code> returns a <code>bytes</code> object that uses
no additional memory, instead using copy-on-write.
</p>
<p>
<p><code>.getbuffer()</code> is another memory-efficient option but it
returns a
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview">memoryview</a>
which has less methods than the <code>bytes</code> you get back from
<code>.getvalue()</code>- it doesn’t have <code>.find()</code> for
example.</p>

Eventually, however, HudZah wore Claude down. He filled his Project with
the e-mail conversations he’d been having with fusor hobbyists, parts
lists for things he’d bought off Amazon, spreadsheets, sections of books
and diagrams. HudZah also changed his questions to Claude from general
ones to more specific ones. This flood of information and better probing
seemed to convince Claude that HudZah did know what he was doing, and
the AI began to give him detailed guidance on how to build a nuclear
fusor and how not to die while doing it.

them together and let other people clean up the mess that

<h2 id="pypi-now-supports-project-archival">PyPI now supports project
archival</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, updated: 2025-01-30, from: Simon Willison’s

<p>
<strong><a href="https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2025-01-30-archival/">PyPI
now supports project archival</a></strong>
</p>
Neat new PyPI feature, similar to GitHub’s
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/archiving-repositories">archiving
repositories</a> feature. You can now mark a PyPI project as “archived”,
making it clear that no new releases are planned (though you can switch
back out of that mode later if you need to).
</p>
<p>
I like the sound of these future plans around this topic:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Project archival is the first step in a larger project, aimed at
improving the <em>lifecycle</em> of projects on PyPI. That project
includes evaluating additional project statuses (things like
“deprecated” and “unmaintained”), as well as changes to
<a href="https://docs.pypi.org/api/">PyPI’s public APIs</a> that will
enable clients to retrieve and act on project status information. You
can track our progress on these fronts by following along with
<a href="https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/16844">warehouse#16844</a>!

<h2 id="mistral-small-3">Mistral Small 3</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, updated: 2025-01-30, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-small-3/">Mistral Small
3</a></strong>
</p>
First model release of 2025 for French AI lab Mistral, who describe
Mistral Small 3 as “a latency-optimized 24B-parameter model released
under the Apache 2.0 license.”
</p>
<p>
More notably, they claim the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Mistral Small 3 is competitive with larger models such as Llama 3.3 70B
or Qwen 32B, and is an excellent open replacement for opaque proprietary
models like GPT4o-mini. Mistral Small 3 is on par with Llama 3.3 70B
instruct, while being more than 3x faster on the same hardware.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Llama 3.3 70B and Qwen 32B are two of my favourite models to run on my
laptop - that ~20GB size turns out to be a great trade-off between
memory usage and model utility. It’s exciting to see a new entrant into
that weight class.
</p>
<p>
The license is important: previous Mistral Small models used their
Mistral Research License, which prohibited commercial deployments unless
you negotiate a commercial license with them. They appear to be moving
away from that, at least for their core models:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>We’re renewing our commitment to using Apache 2.0 license for
our general purpose models, as we progressively move away from
MRL-licensed models</strong>. As with Mistral Small 3, model weights
will be available to download and deploy locally, and free to modify and
use in any capacity. […] Enterprises and developers that need
specialized capabilities (increased speed and context, domain specific
knowledge, task-specific models like code completion) can count on
additional commercial models complementing what we contribute to the
community.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Despite being called Mistral Small 3, this appears to be the fourth
release of a model under that label. The Mistral API calls this one
<code>mistral-small-2501</code> - previous model IDs were
<code>mistral-small-2312</code>, <code>mistral-small-2402</code> and
<code>mistral-small-2409</code>.
</p>
<p>
I’ve
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mistral/releases/tag/0.10">updated
the llm-mistral plugin</a> for talking directly to Mistral’s
<a href="https://docs.mistral.ai/deployment/laplateforme/overview/">La
Plateforme</a> API:
</p>
<pre><code>llm install -U llm-mistral
llm keys set mistral
# Paste key here
llm -m mistral/mistral-small-latest "tell me a joke about a badger and a puffin"
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
Sure, here’s a light-hearted joke for you:
</p>
<p>
Why did the badger bring a puffin to the party?
</p>
<p>
Because he heard puffins make great party ‘Puffins’!
</p>
<p>
(That’s a play on the word “puffins” and the phrase “party people.”)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
API pricing is $0.10/million tokens of input, $0.30/million tokens of
output - half the price of the previous Mistral Small API model
($0.20/$0.60). for comparison, GPT-4o mini is $0.15/$0.60.
</p>
<p>
Mistral also ensured that the new model was
<a href="https://ollama.com/library/mistral-small">available on
Ollama</a> in time for their release announcement.
</p>
<p>
You can pull the model like this (fetching 14GB):
</p>
<pre><code>ollama run mistral-small:24b
</code></pre>
<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/taketwo/llm-ollama">llm-ollama</a>
plugin will then let you prompt it like so:
</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-ollama
llm -m mistral-small:24b "say hi"
</code></pre>

<li>Technology offers remarkable tools to oversee and develop the
world’s resources. However, in some cases, humanity is increasingly
ceding control of these resources to machines. Within some circles of
scientists and futurists, there is optimism about the potential of
artificial general intelligence (AGI), a hypothetical form of AI that
would match or surpass human intelligence and bring about unimaginable
advancements. Some even speculate that AGI could achieve superhuman
capabilities. At the same time, as society drifts away from a connection
with the transcendent, some are tempted to turn to AI in search of
meaning or fulfillment—longings that can only be truly satisfied in
communion with God.
<a href="https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_ddf_doc_20250128_antiqua-et-nova_en.html#_ftn194">[194]</a>

<li>However, <em>the presumption of substituting God for an artifact of
human making is idolatry</em>, a practice Scripture explicitly warns
against (e.g., Ex. 20:4; 32:1-5; 34:17). Moreover, AI may prove even
more seductive than traditional idols for, unlike idols that “have
mouths but do not speak; eyes, but do not see; ears, but do not hear”
(Ps. 115:5-6), AI can “speak,” or at least gives the illusion of doing
so (cf. Rev. 13:15). Yet, it is vital to remember that AI is but a pale
reflection of humanity—it is crafted by human minds, trained on
human-generated material, responsive to human input, and sustained
through human labor. AI cannot possess many of the capabilities specific
to human life, and it is also fallible. By turning to AI as a perceived
“Other” greater than itself, with which to share existence and
responsibilities, humanity risks creating a substitute for God. However,
it is not AI that is ultimately deified and worshipped, but humanity
itself—which, in this way, becomes enslaved to its own work.

Llama 4 is making great progress in training. Llama 4 mini is done with
pre-training and our reasoning models and larger model are looking good
too. Our goal with Llama 3 was to make open source competitive with
closed models, and our goal for Llama 4 is to lead. Llama 4 will be
natively multimodal – it’s an omni-model – and it will have agentic
capabilities, so it’s going to be novel and it’s going to unlock a lot
of new use cases.

"seem" to him (and thus holding them responsible for how they seem).
Would you so publicly ask similar questions of women for their

<h2 id="was-it-cake">Was It Cake?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: McSweeney’s Internet Tendency</p>
<p>
“It’s not cake!” my wife screamed as the cleaver split the thermostat in
our foyer. I pushed past her and sank my chef’s knife into the Ethan
Allen sofa we had bought when we moved. Goose down spilled out of the
gash. I looked at my wife and grimaced.
</p>
<p>
“Not cake!” our children screeched as they danced in the floating
feathers.
</p>
<p>
Seven days prior, we had been selected for a new Netflix game show,
<i>Is It Cake? Extreme Home Edition</i>. Once we’d signed the paperwork,
we spent one night at the La Quinta off the interstate while the
producers replaced one item in our home with a perfect replica made of
cake. We had to find the cake within seven days in order to win the
grand prize of $75,000. Our time would be up at sunset today, and the
sun was getting very low in the sky.
</p>
<p>
“Hurry!” my wife shrieked. “Where is the cake?”
</p>
<p>
I tried to think. I had sledgehammered the pet memorial markers in the
backyard to make sure no cake was hidden inside of them. My wife had
crashed her Passat into my parked Honda Pilot to make sure the cars were
not cake. After the children had gone to bed on Day 6, I had torn apart
our modest collection of sex toys. Still no cake.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe the safe?” I yelled at my wife. “Did we look in the safe?”
</p>
<p>
We hurried to our bedroom and opened the safe hidden behind her boots. I
punched in the code, and the door swung open. The contents all looked in
order, but how could we be sure? I grabbed the handgun—it didn’t feel
like cake, but there was only one way to know. I raised the gun above my
head and fired four shots in rapid succession. The noise was deafening.
</p>
<p>
“What the fuck?!” Todd the cameraman shouted. “What is wrong with you?
The gun is not cake!”
</p>
<p>
I eyed him. Was it part of his job to trick me? Was the fifth bullet
cake? I squeezed off the rest of the clip, shooting skyward. Drywall
rained down on us. The ceiling was not cake.
</p>
<p>
“I am fucking leaving!” the cameraman screamed into his headset as he
backed out of the room. I was sure he was going to run back to the
production van parked in front of our house, probably to stare at the
piece of paper that described what item in our house was cake and to
laugh at us.
</p>
<p>
My wife was holding the manilla envelope we had filled with paper
bonds—our life savings.
</p>
<p>
“Is this cake?” she asked pleadingly.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” I said. “We will be able to tell if we burn it.”
</p>
<p>
We emptied the $427,000 worth of bonds into our bathroom wastebasket. I
grabbed one of the fart matches and threw it into the pile.
</p>
<p>
“Is it burning like paper or cake?” my wife asked desperately.
</p>
<p>
I looked closely at it. How did a cake burn? Ashes floated up around me.
I leaned in further and inhaled deeply. I smelled no burnt sugar.
</p>
<p>
“Not cake,” I said quietly.
</p>
<p>
Tearing my clothes off, I ran to the front of the house. My children and
wife followed. “Everyone, take your clothes off,” I screamed over my
shoulder. “All of them—make sure they aren’t cake!”
</p>
<p>
We emerged from the house naked, and surrounded the production van. I
climbed onto the hood and pressed my butt cheeks against the windshield.
</p>
<p>
“Does it feel like cake to your butt cheeks?” my wife howled.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t tell!” I cried and pressed my butt cheeks harder into the
glass. I hopped down and shouted commands at my family.
</p>
<p>
“Everyone: put your hands on the van’s side—smallest ones in the middle!
Now, rock the van to see if it’s cake!”
</p>
<p>
Our bare bodies worked in unison, shoving hard. We were on the door
side, and the production team was trying to open it and escape.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t let them out!” I screamed. “They might be a jam filling!”
</p>
<p>
We rocked the van back and forth, pushing its center of gravity farther
and farther outside of its axis until, finally, it crashed on its side.
Glass and plastic covered the street.
</p>
<p>
“It’s not cake!” my wife sobbed, balling up her fists and slamming them
against the tires.
</p>
<p>
I turned around and saw the last slivers of light coming across the
horizon. My neighbor Brad emerged from his house.
</p>
<p>
“What in the heck, Dominic? What are you doing out here? Why don’t any
of you have any clothes on, for Pete’s sake?”
</p>
<p>
My mind reeled. I grabbed the side mirror that had broken off the van
and smashed it on the ground, giving it a jagged edge.
</p>
<p>
“You’re the fucking cake, aren’t you, Brad?”
</p>
<p>
Brad backed away, raising his palms to me. “Dominic, can a frankfurting
cake talk? What has gotten into you?”
</p>
<p>
It was a persuasive argument. I lowered the mirror and looked down at my
naked body. I was bleeding. My children sat on the pavement in a huddled
mass, weeping. It was nighttime.
</p>
<p>
I looked up and saw Howie Mandel, the host of <i>Is It Cake? Extreme
Home Edition</i>.
</p>
<p>
“We did not find the cake, Howie,” I said.
</p>
<p>
Mandel stared back, disgusted. Police sirens wailed and drew closer.
</p>
<p>
“You’re going to jail, Dominic.”
</p>
<p>
I thought for a moment.
</p>
<p>
“Is the jail cake?”
