id="microsoft-maintains-its-own-windows-debloat-scripts-on-github">Microsoft
maintains its own Windows debloat scripts on GitHub</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s no secret that a default Windows installation is… Hefty. In more
ways than one, Windows is a bit on the obese side of the spectrum, from
taking up a lot of disk space, to requiring hefty system requirements
(artificial or not), to coming with a lot of stuff preinstalled not
everyone wants to have to deal with. As such, there’s a huge cottage
industry of applications, scripts, modified installers, custom ISOs, and
more, that try to slim Windows down to a more manageable size. As it
turns out, even Microsoft itself wants in on this action. The company
that develops and sells Windows also provides a Windows debloat script.
Over on GitHub, Microsoft maintains a repository of scripts simplify
setting up Windows as a development environment, and amid the collection
of scripts we find RemoveDefaultApps.ps1, a PowerShell script to
“Uninstall unnecessary applications that come with Windows out of the
box”. The script is about two years old, and as such it includes a few
applications no longer part of Windows, but looking through the list is
a sad reminder of the kind of junk Windows comes with, most notably
mobile casino games for children like Bubble Witch and March of Empires,
but also other nonsense like the Mixed Reality Portal or Duolingo. It
also removes something called “ActiproSoftwareLLC“, which are apparently
a set of third-party, non-Microsoft UI controls for WPF? Which comes
preinstalled with Windows sometimes? What is even happening over there?
The entire set of scripts makes use of Chocolatey wrapped in Boxstarter,
which is “a wrapper for Chocolatey and includes features like managing
reboots for you”, because of course, the people at Microsoft working on
Windows can’t be bothered to fix application management and required
reboots themselves. Silly me, expecting Microsoft’s Windows developers
to address these shortcomings internally instead of using third-party
tools. The repository seems to be mostly defunct, but the fact it even
exists in the first place is such a damning indictment of the state of
Windows. People keep telling us Windows is fine, but if even Microsoft
itself needs to resort to scripts and third-party tools to make it
usable, I find it hard to take claims of Windows being fine seriously in
any way, shape, or form.</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>In early 2022 I got several Sun SPARC servers for free off of a
FreeCycle ad: I was recently called out for not providing any sort of
update on those devices… so here we go! ↫ Sidneys1.com Some information
on booting old-style SPARC machines, as well as pretty pictures. Nice
palate-cleanser if you’ve had to deal with something unpleasant this
weekend. This world would be a better place if we all had our own Sun
machines to play with when we get sad.</p>

<h2 id="episode-143---the-haunted-hard-drive">Episode 143 - The Haunted
Hard Drive</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-20, from: Advent of Computing</p>
<p>
Have you ever felt like a computer just refuses to work? Like a machine
has a mind of it’s own? In 1970 a hard drive at the National Farmers
Union Corp. office decided to do just that. That year it started
crashing for apparently no reason. It would take 2 years and 56 crashes
to sort out the problem. The ultimate solution would leave more
questions than answers. Was the hard drive haunted? Or was something
else at play?

<p>The press has no power over Trump, he went around them going directly
to the people through Twitter. Musk observed this, bought Twitter, for
which his ROI will be huge. The Dems ignored this, and played the
political game as if Twitter never happened. For Trump it was an
accident, but not for Musk, he knew exactly what he was doing.</p>

means</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-20, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti</p>
<p>
I’ve recently started a new job as a documentation engineer. While my
work is largely the same as that of a technical writer, the sound and
semantics of my new job title gave me some pause and made me think about
what it really means to be doing docs-as-code. To say that it’s about
writing documentation using the same tools and methods as software
developers is correct, but fails to acknowledge the full consequences of
the fact. Most descriptions of docs-as-code are naive because they stop
at the implications of being developers’ attachés.
