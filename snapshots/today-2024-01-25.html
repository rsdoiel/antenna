I co-wrote a
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090303082440/http://www.soapware.org/bdg">Busy
Developer’s Guide to SOAP</a> in 2001, because it was so desperately
<a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/04/04/aBusyDevelopersGuideToSoap.html">needed</a>.
SOAP was a tangle of specs, which must have made sense to someone, not
sure who, but was incomprehensible to app developers, the same ways
ActivityPub is today. I have no idea if the BDG helped, but it was the
only way I felt I could be supportive of the protocol, without saying it
was a complete failure. I was unusual in that among the developers of
the protocol, I was the only one who didn’t work at a big company, so if
I wanted to do something badly enough, I could just do it. The basic
<a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/04/04/aBusyDevelopersGuideToSoap.html">message</a>
was: “If you want to implement SOAP in your app, this is one way to do
it. And if you do, your software will interop with mine.”</p>

<li>Report: Biden delaying approval of major LNG export terminal
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>The Biden administration has delayed approval of 17 new
facilities for the export of liquified natural gas (LNG), according to a
<em>New York Times
</em><a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=6eca21cb16&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>.
Officials are instead asking the Department of Energy to widen its
review of the first of these 17 — known as Calcasieu Pass 2, or CP2 — to
include effects on the global climate. <em>Heatmap</em> reached out to
the White House and got a “no comment” in response. Such a decision, if
confirmed, would be seen as a win for climate advocates who oppose the
terminals due to their potential environmental toll: At least one
analysis shows that, if all 17 export terminals were to be approved, the
emissions related to the fuel that would flow through them would exceed
the annual greenhouse gas emissions of the entire European Union. “Um, I
think we all just won,”

Bill McKibben, who is perhaps the project’s staunchest foe.<br/> <br/>
Republicans would likely oppose the decision, and some already accuse
President Biden of waging a war on affordable domestic energy. “What was
never in question is that this would be a major campaign issue, no
matter what Biden did,”
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=8b806d8a8e&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote<em>

expectations. Earnings per share came in at $0.71, slightly below Wall

investors’ concerns</a> about the company’s footing in the shifting EV
landscape: Demand for EVs is still growing but at a slower pace than
before, and competition is heating up at home and abroad. China’s BYD
overtook Tesla at the end of last year as the world’s top-selling EV
maker. During the earnings call, Musk took the opportunity to call for

The Marshall Islands are “at the very front lines of climate change,”

ABC News, and one expert told the outlet that so-called extreme waves
like these could become more common as sea levels rise. A separate

earlier this month found that storm waves hitting the Americas today are
80% bigger than they were 40 years ago. “Coastal towns and vessels
urgently need to prepare better defenses – especially in the Americas –
to avoid damage from these extreme waves,” said tropical storm expert
Dr. Xiangbo Feng, who co-authored the study.

that cases of dengue fever would “take off” in the next decade as
climate change accelerates. That timeline may have been far too
conservative. Already cases of the mosquito-borne illness are rising
dramatically in South America, <em>Reuters</em>

Argentina recorded more than 12,500 cases last month and stores are
running out of bug spray. In Brazil, cases more than doubled in the
first week of January compared to last year. Hospitals in Paraguay have
set up night clinics to deal with a surge in patients. Dengue is often
asymptomatic but can cause terrible joint pain in some patients and more
than 35,000 people die from infections each year. “Climate change has
expanded the range for mosquitoes to breed,” explained Thais dos Santos
from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). A mass vaccination
program is underway in Brazil.

two major contracts. The new projects would produce about 3,470

billion in economic benefits. But the clean energy would come at a cost
for customers: The average residential bill would go up by about $7 per

operators of one of the projects promised to provide direct assistance
to some low-income households to offset the increase. The wind farms are

Delegation Affirms Bipartisan Support for Taiwan During Visit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TAIPEI, Taiwan — A bipartisan delegation from the U.S. Congress
reaffirmed support for Taiwan during a visit Thursday, following the
election of its new president. The delegation’s visit is the first from
U.S. lawmakers to the island since the independence-leaning Democratic
Progressive Party won a third-straight term in the January 13
presidential election.</p>
<p>China, America’s chief competitor for global influence, claims Taiwan
as its own territory and threatens to use force to bring the self-ruling
island under its control. Beijing strongly condemned Lai Ching-te’s
election and appears set to continue its policy of refusing to engage
with the island’s government — a practice that’s been in place since
Tsai Ing-wen’s election in 2016.</p>
<p>“The support of the United States for Taiwan is firm. It’s real, and
it is 100% bipartisan,” U.S. Representative Mario Díaz Balart said.</p>
<p>Balart, a Florida Republican, was joined by California Democrat Ami
Bera.</p>
<p>“In the 21st century, there’s no place for aggressive action. We have
to learn to live together, to trade together, to work together, to solve
problems together,” Bera said.</p>
<p>“Just know that we are proud of the people of Taiwan. We are proud of
the relationship and as strong as that relationship has always been.
That is assured. It will even be stronger,” Balart said.</p>
<p>“So, we look forward to working together to continue to protect the
peace, prosperity (and) the future of Taiwan. It’s up to people of
Taiwan,” Bera said.</p>
<p>President-elect Lai thanked the visiting co-chairs of the U.S.
Congressional Taiwan Caucus for their visit, saying that “today’s Taiwan
is a Taiwan of the world.”</p>
<p>“Moving forward, I will work with Vice President-elect Hsiao Bi-khim
to build upon the foundation laid by President Tsai to unite the people
of Taiwan, strengthen social resilience and continue to defend the
cross-strait status quo of peace and stability.”</p>
<p>The president-elect also touched on continued military assistance
from the U.S. and a proposed agreement to avoid mutual taxation of
companies.</p>
<p>Beijing objects to any form of official contact between the U.S. and
Taiwan. In 2022, it responded to a visit by then-House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi with some of its largest military maneuvers in years, including
missile launches and a simulated blockade of the island. It views visits
by foreign government officials as a recognition of the island’s
sovereignty.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden, seeking to calm that complaint, insists there’s
no change in America’s longstanding “One-China” policy, which recognizes
Beijing as representing China but allows informal relations and defense
ties with Taipei.</p>
<p>Washington cut formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 in
order to recognize China, but U.S. law requires it to ensure the island
has the ability to defend itself. That has translated into a heavy
reliance on U.S. military hardware and a law saying that Washington must
treat threats against the island as a matter of “grave concern.”</p>
<p>China regularly sends warplanes and navy ships to intimidate and
harass Taiwan, with 18 planes and six ships operating near the island in
the 24 hours before 6 a.m. Thursday. Another three Chinese balloons were

<h2 id="concerns-over-us-support-of-israel-hang-over-2024-poll">Concerns
Over US Support of Israel Hang Over 2024 Poll</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington/nashua, new hampshire — The burning conflict in Gaza has
lit a spark under untold numbers of American voters, and put extra heat
on U.S. President Joe Biden’s reelection bid. Protesters have
interrupted his recent campaign appearances to express their anger over
his support of Israel’s military campaign.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, protesters briefly disrupted a labor union event where
Biden was speaking. During a Tuesday rally focused on abortion access,
14 protesters shouted through most of Biden’s speech in Manassas,
Virginia. The interruptions clearly frustrated the president.</p>
<p>“This is going to go on for a while,” Biden said. “They have got this
planned.”</p>
<p>That protest was organized by Die-In For Humanity, a 700-member
strong protest group that has made nearly 100 appearances at Biden
events, the U.S. Capitol, outside administration members’ homes, outside
the Israeli Embassy, and at January’s protest in Washington.</p>
<p>“I think the majority of people are not OK with American tax dollars
being used to commit atrocities overseas,” Hazami Barmada, the group’s
lead organizer, told VOA. She was among the protesters escorted out of
Tuesday’s event.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing a shift in the tide in the United States with complete
rejection — in essence — of Biden,” said Barmada. “…what we’re saying is
that you’re not going to get the vote of the American community when you
constantly continue to disregard the voices of the Arab American
community that are saying stop the injustice and the atrocities in
Gaza.”</p>
<p>The White House said Wednesday the president supports Americans’
right to peacefully protest.</p>
<p>“He also believes it’s really important that Israel have the right
and the ability to continue to defend themselves against — which is …
what is clearly still a viable threat from Hamas,” said John Kirby,
strategic communications coordinator for the National Security
Council.</p>
<p>“But that doesn’t mean we’re going to stop, again, urging a stronger
focus by our Israeli counterparts on minimizing civilian casualties and
on getting aid in,” Kirby said.</p>
<p>Foreign policy, political analysts say, rarely drives elections but
can make a difference when the competition is tight. Like for undecided
New Hampshire voter Isaac Geer, who participated Tuesday in a primary
vote that Biden and Republican contender Donald Trump won for their
respective parties.</p>
<p>“The biggest thing I’m voting for this election season is foreign
policy,” he told VOA, speaking in Nashua, New Hampshire. “It’s really
important to me that we stay out of any foreign wars and keep our
military spending down, and bring our troops back home or keep them
home.”</p>
<p>Trump’s plan to resolve the Gaza crisis is unclear, and his previous
actions as president included a much-criticized “ban” of Muslim
immigrants. VOA reached out several times to the Trump campaign, but
they did not respond.</p>
<p>For Muslim activists, it’s a stark choice. Hassan Abdel Salam is a
Minneapolis-based professor who co-founded the Abandon Biden movement of
Muslim voters, which focuses on swing states. He is a Canadian
citizen.</p>
<p>“Mr. Trump prevented our friends and colleagues and family from
entering the country,” he told VOA. “But Mr. Biden killed them. And that
four years under any Republican is incomparable to one day in Gaza, that
an argument has emerged within our communities, that we have to
sacrifice.”</p>
<p>Political analysts say Biden is in a difficult position.</p>
<p>“There’s no doubt that the situation in Gaza is a political problem
for Biden,” Norm Ornstein, a senior fellow emeritus at the American
Enterprise Institute, told VOA. “If you step back and look objectively,
Biden has handled this issue adroitly about as well as any president
could. He understood early on that by hugging [Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin] Netanyahu close, he could keep some of the worst things from
happening in Gaza. But he’s now getting very close to pushing Bibi
aside. And that means that the initial move — which alienated a lot of
voters, not just Arab American voters, but young progressives — may in
fact end up being worse for him, because if he pushes or spurns Bibi
Netanyahu aside, then some of his strongest supporters, pro-Israel
supporters, may be unhappy as well.”</p>

is to entering beta! It looks like they just need to add a way to create
an account through the web interface (rather than the server admin
having to create accounts manually), and add support for the ActivityPub
<code>Move</code> activity (so you can migrate your account from, say,
Mastodon). There’s other stuff they want to add after that, but nothing
that would hold back “beta” status.

<p>
I can’t really see myself migrating my main Fedi account to GoToSocial
in the near future, but I <em>could</em> see myself trying it out for my
auxlangs or “political toots” accounts. Hopefully some more parties will
get on board with offering managed GoToSocial hosting once it’s in beta,
though, because working out how to deploy it and put it behind a
reverse-proxy and whatnot might be a liiiiiittle beyond me 🙃

<h2 id="chinas-foreign-visitor-numbers-slow-to-recover">China’s Foreign
Visitor Numbers Slow to Recover</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Austin, Texas — As China tries to show itself as welcoming foreign
trade and tourism, its border authorities announced last week that the
country had more than 35 million entries and exits by foreign nationals
in 2023.</p>
<p>That was nearly seven times more than 2022, when Beijing’s draconian
Zero-COVID policy was still in effect and visitors stayed away.  </p>
<p>Still, the 2023 figure is around a third of the 97 million foreigner
border crossings that were recorded in 2019 before the pandemic.  </p>
<p>Experts and visa applicants say concerns about personal freedom are
discouraging visitors, despite Beijing’s loosening visa requirements.
 </p>
<p>China’s embassy in the United States announced in late December that
from January it would relax visa applications for U.S. citizens, no
longer requiring them to submit detailed materials such as round-trip
flight tickets, hotel reservations, itineraries, or invitation letters.
 </p>
<p>That is a welcome change for some Americans, like one recent graduate
who tells VOA he has a long, complicated trip that he hopes to start in
China and end in Southeast Asia. </p>
<p>“I want to stay in Beijing for a while first, visit China’s ancient
sites, and then go all the way south to Yunnan (Province), and then
continue south to visit Laos and other Southeast Asian countries,” said
the graduate, who asked to be called Michael to avoid the attention of
Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>But Michael said he’s reluctant to go through with the China leg,
despite it being the country he wants to visit most, because he fears
his personal freedom could be at risk – even as a tourist. </p>
<p>“I saw the State Department updated their travel advisory to
‘reconsider travel.’ I am not sure if I should plan to visit China, or
maybe I can go but should take a few precautions.”  </p>
<p>In June of last year, the U.S. State Department re-issued its level 3
travel alert on China with an update to reconsider travel there due to
the “risk of wrongful detentions.”  It also contained language on
previous alerts to reconsider travel based on the risk of “arbitrary
enforcement of local laws, including in relation to exit bans.” </p>
<p>Such concern is part of the challenge Beijing faces as it tries to
present a positive image of the country as welcoming to traders and
visitors.</p>
<p>The relaxed rules for Americans came just a month after China
announced a visa-free policy from December for ordinary passport holders
from six countries — France, Germany, Holland, Italy, Malaysia, and
Spain.</p>
<p>China’s National Immigration Administration says the number of
visitors from those countries was 28.5% higher in December than in the
previous month. Beijing last week added Switzerland and Ireland to the
visa-free policy.  </p>
<p>China’s Civil Aviation Administration this month said it aims to
boost direct flights between China and the U.S. from the current 63
flights per week.  It had in November set a goal of reaching 70 flights
per week to boost tourism and trade. </p>
<p>While it’s not yet clear whether the increased flights and loosened
visa restrictions have boosted the number of Americans visiting China,
those VOA spoke to who plan or regularly visit China expressed concerns
about the worsening risks.  </p>
<p>A Chinese-American from Houston, Texas, who works in international
trade and travels to China five to six times per year, told VOA that
while the requirements for tourist visa applications have been relaxed,
since last year he noticed Chinese customs officers ask arriving
visitors more questions than in the past.  He asked to use the pseudonym
“Mr. Li” in order to speak more freely with VOA about the issue.  </p>
<p>“One difference is that China now [tacitly implies] that every
foreigner, including every foreign Chinese, is a spy,” he said.</p>
<p>Last July, a revised version of China’s counter-espionage law went
into effect raising fears of more arbitrary arrests. That has made
Americans more concerned about traveling to China and Chinese citizens
more wary of foreigners. </p>
<p>Zev Faintuch, a senior intelligence analyst with Global Guardian - a
risk assessment firm that works with multinational companies - says
there is still plenty of interest in going to China. </p>
<p>But, he adds, “because of that law, it’s legally much easier to
detain foreigners as a result.” </p>
<p>Faintuch says he’s seen an increase in businesses wanting to assess
the overall situation in China but is not optimistic conditions will
improve.</p>
<p>“At least from where we are sitting, what we’re telling our clients,
our message here is, we believe that the window for doing business in
China is closing for Western companies,” he said.</p>
<p>Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on
Foreign Relations, told VOA that visitors should take that into
consideration before planning to go to China.  </p>
<p>“The release of the counter-espionage law encourages Chinese citizens
to report to the government the people who they consider are like the
FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation),” Huang said, adding that the
approach treats “potential visitors like they are not that welcome.”</p>

Judge Approves Signature-Gathering Stage for Petition to Put Abortion
Rights on 2024 Ballot</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>RENO, Nevada — A Nevada judge has approved a petition by abortion
access advocates as eligible for signature gathering in their
long-standing attempt to get abortion rights on the 2024 ballot.</p>
<p>Carson City District Judge James T. Russell made the ruling Tuesday,
about two months after he struck down a similar yet broader version
that, if passed, would have enshrined additional reproductive rights
into the state’s constitution.</p>
<p>If the Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom political action committee
gets enough signatures, a question would appear on the November ballot
that would enshrine abortion access for up to 24 weeks, or as needed to
protect the health of the pregnant patient, into the Nevada
Constitution.  Then, voters would need to approve it again on the 2026
ballot to amend the constitution.</p>
<p>Abortion rights up to 24 weeks are already codified into Nevada law
through a 1990 referendum, where two-thirds of voters were in favor.
That could be changed with another referendum.</p>
<p>The standards are higher for amending the constitution, which
requires either approval from two legislative sessions and an election,
or two consecutive elections with a simple majority of votes.</p>
<p>The petition that was cleared for signatures is one of two efforts
from the Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom committee to get the right to
abortion on the 2024 ballot.</p>
<p>Russell rejected an earlier petition in a November ruling, saying the
proposed ballot initiative was too broad, contained a “misleading
description of effect” and had an unfunded mandate.</p>
<p>The petition would have included protections for “matters relating to
their pregnancies” including prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care,
birth control, vasectomies, tubal ligations, abortion and abortion care,
as well as care for miscarriages and infertility. Nevadans for
Reproductive Freedom appealed that rejection to the Nevada Supreme Court
and are waiting for a new ruling.</p>
<p>The petition approved for signatures Tuesday had narrower language —
“establishing a fundamental, individual right to abortion,” which
applies to “decisions about matters relating to abortion” without
government interference.</p>
<p>In a statement following the ruling, Nevadans for Reproductive
Freedom spokesperson Lindsey Harmon celebrated the ruling but said she
remained confident that the committee’s initial petition would be
recognized as eligible by the Nevada Supreme Court.</p>
<p>“Abortion rights are not the only form of reproductive freedom under
attack across the country,” Harmon said. “Protecting miscarriage
management, birth control, prenatal and postpartum care, and other vital
reproductive health care services are inextricably linked pieces of a
singular right to reproductive freedom.”</p>
<p>Abortion rights have become a mobilizing issue for Democrats since
the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 court
decision establishing a nationwide right to abortion.</p>
<p>Constitutional amendments protecting abortion access are already set
to appear on the 2024 ballot in New York and Maryland and could also
show up in a host of states, including Missouri and Arizona.</p>
<p>Lawmakers in Nevada’s Democratic-controlled Legislature are also
attempting to get reproductive rights including abortion access in front
of voters on the 2026 ballot. The initiative, which would enshrine those
rights in the state constitution, passed the state Senate and Assembly
in May 2023 and now must be approved with a simple majority again in
2025 before being eligible for the 2026 ballot.</p>

id="analysts-us-south-korea-should-be-ready-for-russia-north-korea-alliance">Analysts:
US, South Korea Should Be Ready for Russia-North Korea Alliance</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Depending on what kinds of weapons technology Moscow
transfers to Pyongyang, the United States and South Korea may need to
update their measures for dealing with North Korean threats, said
analysts.  </p>
<p>John Kirby, White House National Security Council spokesman, said the
U.S. is watching “very closely” as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un
pursues advanced military capabilities from Russian President Vladimir
Putin.</p>
<p>Kirby said at a press briefing on Tuesday that Kim’s ability to
benefit from this relationship is concerning, but the U.S. and South
Korean defensive posture on the Korean Peninsula “is appropriate to the
risk.”</p>
<p>Since July, when Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu visited North
Korea, Pyongyang has been deepening its military ties with Moscow while
escalating threats on the peninsula and calling for preparations to
occupy South Korea if war breaks out.</p>
<p>North Korea fired cruise missiles into the waters off its western
coast on Wednesday, according to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff. It
also began taking down a monument in Pyongyang symbolizing reunification
with South Korea.</p>
<p>Putin and North Korean Ambassador Choe Son Hui discussed bilateral
relations in Moscow on January 16, according to Tass, the Russian
state-owned news agency. It quoted Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov
the next day saying Moscow and Pyongyang “intend to boost relations in
all areas, including sensitive ones.”</p>
<p>The most worrisome technology North Korea could seek from Russia
would enable Pyongyang to miniaturize nuclear warheads to fit into a
ballistic missile cone, survive reentry and hit targets in South Korea,
Japan and North America, said Robert Peters, a fellow for nuclear
deterrence and missile defense at the Heritage Foundation.</p>
<p>“This technology is the last and the most critical step in North
Korea fielding a credible nuclear strike capability and is well within
Russia’s ability to share,” Peters told VOA via email.</p>
<p>He continued, “South Korea and the United States should prepare to
face a North Korea that is technically more capable than it has been
before.”</p>
<p>At an event in Washington hosted by the Center for Strategic and
International Studies on January 18, Pranay Vaddi, the National Security
Council’s senior director for arms control and nonproliferation, warned
that the North Korean threat “could drastically change over the coming
decade” as a result of military cooperation with Moscow.</p>
<p>“What we are seeing between Russia and North Korea is an
unprecedented level of cooperation in the military sphere,” Vaddi
said.</p>
<p>Last year, Putin turned to North Korea to replenish Russia’s weapons
stockpile, which has been drawn down severely since the invasion of
Ukraine in February 2022. He met with Kim in Russia in September to
discuss possible arms dealings.</p>
<p>In October, Washington released satellite photos showing North Korea
shipping more than 1,000 containers of weapons to Russia in violation of
sanctions.</p>
<p>Artillery and missiles North Korea provided to Russia have been
turning up in Ukraine, The New York Times reported on Monday.</p>
<p>John Erath, senior policy director for the Center for Arms Control
and Non-Proliferation, said Russian technology transfers “would not so
much change the threat as add to the atmosphere of tension on the
peninsula.”</p>
<p>But he told VOA via email, “It will be important to keep defense and
deterrence arrangements updated.”</p>
<p>In November, the U.S. and South Korea held an annual Security
Consultative Meeting in Seoul, where they announced the revision of the
2013 Tailored Deterrence Strategy “in recognition of the changing
security environment.</p>
<p>Their meeting followed a summit that U.S. President Joe Biden and
South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol held in April in Washington, where
they announced the Washington Declaration aimed at strengthening nuclear
deterrence on the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>Gary Samore, White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of
mass destruction during the Obama administration, said in a telephone
interview that weapons technology Pyongyang could obtain from Moscow
could embolden it to raise threats but would not be a game changer
requiring the revision of “fundamental deterrence” on the Korean
Peninsula.</p>
<p>Samore, a professor at Brandeis University, thinks Pyongyang could
seek enhanced technology to include surface-to-air missiles, spy
satellite collection capabilities and advanced military fighter
aircraft.</p>
<p>He told VOA that although Moscow would be “happy whenever there is
trouble for the U.S.,” it would not encourage Pyongyang to cause
conflict on the Korean Peninsula that would “jeopardize the flow of
weapons to Russia” for its war in Ukraine.</p>

Despite losing the New Hampshire vote by over 10 points, Haley declared

Woman Who Lost Lawsuit to Get Abortion to Attend Biden’s State of the
Union</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden have
extended an invitation to attend the president’s State of the Union
address to a Texas woman who sued her state and lost over the ability to
get an abortion.</p>
<p>The Texas Supreme Court denied Kate Cox’s request. But by then, her
lawyers said, she had already traveled out of state for an abortion.</p>
<p>The Bidens spoke with Cox on Sunday and invited her to the annual
address set for March 7 at the U.S. Capitol. Cox will sit with the first
lady, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday. Cox
accepted the invite, she said.</p>
<p>“They thanked her for her courage in sharing her story and speaking
out against the impact of the extreme abortion ban in Texas,”
Jean-Pierre said.</p>
<p>Cox, 31, was pregnant with her third child when she learned the fetus
had a rare genetic disorder. The couple was informed by doctors that
their baby would live at best a week. She sued over the right to have an
abortion to end the pregnancy but lost because the judges said she
hadn’t shown her life was in danger enough to be granted the
procedure.</p>
<p>The White House invitation reflects how strongly the administration
is leaning into reproductive rights as a galvanizing force for voters in
the upcoming presidential election after the Supreme Court in 2022
overturned abortion protections. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris
and their spouses on Tuesday centered their first major campaign rally
of the election year on abortion rights.</p>
<p>In his speech, Biden spoke about the increased medical challenges
women are facing since the fall of Roe v. Wade, particularly for women
who never intended to end their pregnancies. He laid the blame on
Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, who as president appointed three
conservative justices to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>This will be the first State of the Union under Republican House
Speaker Mike Johnson, who will sit behind the president and to his left
during the address to Congress. This year’s speech will offer an
opportunity for Biden to detail his broader vision and policy priorities
as he campaigns for reelection in November.</p>

<h2 id="biden-bets-on-the-climate-crowd">Biden Bets on the Climate
Crowd</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTE3ODA4OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MDcwMjUyOH0.Vc8XMjki5BafbWDX7qzC8RJzO4USMliMgANn0hDRUCY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
This morning, as far as anyone knew, the U.S. was considering whether to
approve 17 new facilities for the export of liquified natural gas. By
this afternoon, in a move destined to ripple through the race for the
White House, those considerations were off. According to
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/climate/biden-lng-export-terminal-cp2.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reporting
by <em>The New York Times</em></a>, Biden officials have paused their
decisionmaking, instead asking the Department of Energy to widen its
review of the first of these 17 — known as Calcasieu Pass 2, or CP2 — to
include effects on the global climate.
</p>
<p>
“Um, I think we all just won,” wrote Bill McKibben — perhaps the
project’s staunchest foe — in a
<a href="https://billmckibben.substack.com/p/um-i-think-we-all-just-won" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">newsletter</a>
sent out just a few hours later. “Yes,” he wrote, “there are always
devils in the details. And it doesn’t guarantee long-term victory — it
sets up a process where victory is possible (to this point, the industry
has gotten every permit they’ve asked for). But I have a beer in my
hand.”
</p>
<p>
That possible breaking of historical precedent partially explains why
McKibben is so exhilarated. Another reason has a lot to do with an
<a href="https://www.symonspa.com/post/report-status-of-u-s-lng-export-permits-and-associated-greenhouse-gas-emissions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analysis</a>
of the climate effects of U.S. LNG exports, released in November by
energy analyst Jeremy Symons. Among his most incendiary findings was
that, if all 17 export terminals were approved, the emissions related to
the fuel that would flow through them would exceed the annual greenhouse
gas emissions of the entire European Union.
</p>
<p>
This analysis was not subject to peer review, and it relies on another
<a href="https://www.research.howarthlab.org/publications/Howarth_LNG_assessment_preprint_archived_2023-1103.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">set
of findings</a> from Cornell University researcher Robert Howarth
showing that “the footprint for LNG is greater than that of either coal
or natural gas;” these findings <em>are</em> subject to peer review but
have not yet passed that test. That’s not to say either is inherently
suspect, but neither is exactly a consensus opinion.
</p>
<p>
Biden’s administration has itself been split over the decision,
according to
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-19/climate-test-for-natural-gas-exports-splits-white-house-advisers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reporting</a>
last week in <em>Bloomberg</em>. The U.S. became the largest global
exporter of LNG after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, according to more
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-02/us-becomes-world-s-top-lng-supplier-after-exports-eclipse-australia-and-qatar" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Bloomberg</em>
data</a>, and some in the administration would rather continue to press
that geopolitical advantage. But others — including Energy Secretary
Jennifer Granholm and climate adviser
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/john-podesta-tax-credits-schedule-hydrogen-sustainable-aviation-fuel-manufacturing" target="_self">John
Podesta</a> — pressed back. “Overall, top advisers are broadly aligned
on the need to make changes — especially after the U.S. and nearly 200
other nations committed in December to transition away from fossil
fuels,” the <em>Bloomberg</em> authors cautioned. “The fault lines are
over how aggressive to be.”
</p>
<p>
Heatmap reached out to the White House and got a “no comment” in
response — neither a confirmation nor a denial, nor any kind of signal
of what may lie ahead. Let’s assume, then, that the <em>Times</em> got
it right. Where does that leave us?
</p>
<p>
Republican leaders and their surrogates were ready with attacks even
before this latest development. “Biden Toys With an LNG Export
Permitting Ban,” the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>editorial board
trumpeted on Monday. On Wednesday, Republican Minority Leader Mitch
McConnell claimed
(<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/america-has-never-exported-so-much-oil-and-gas" target="_self">falsely</a>)
on the Senate floor that “the administration’s war on affordable
domestic energy has been bad news for American workers and consumers
alike.” And, of course, former President Donald Trump has made Biden’s
supposed antipathy for American energy consumers a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change-wind-solar-electric-vehicles-energy" target="_self">staple
of his campaign pitch</a> to re-enter the White House.
</p>
<p>
The thing is, Biden’s climate policies are actually pretty popular, even
if most people
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/inflation-reduction-act-popularity-repeal" target="_self">don’t
know what they are</a>. A substantial majority of Americans — and an
overwhelming majority of both Democrats and Independents —
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/change-polling-concern-belief-republicans-vs-democrats" target="_self">acknowledge</a>
that the climate is changing because of human activity and want to see
the government do things like provide tax incentives for
energy-efficient homes and make it easier to build new wind farms, ,
according to Heatmap’s polling,
<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1830" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">both</a>
of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/offshore-wind-investment-tax-credit-biden" target="_self">which</a>
the Biden administration is doing. (Of course, our results also find
that most Americans, albeit fewer of them, want to make fossil fuel
expansion easier, too.)
</p>
<p>
There are plenty of big questions remaining — not least of which is
whether Biden has, in fact, put off making a decision on these LNG
terminals, but also how such a decision will ripple through the global
energy economy. (Although even in deciding not decide on the expected
timeline, Biden has at the very least raised costs for the developers of
these export facilities, which is a decision in its own right.)
</p>
<p>
What was never in question is that this would be a major campaign issue,
no matter what Biden did. It looks like he has cast his bet in favor of
the climate crowd. We’ll see how it plays.<br/>

Urges North Korea to Halt Provocations, Return to Diplomacy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>state department — The United States has called on North Korea to
refrain from further destabilizing actions and to return to diplomatic
engagement following North Korea’s firing of several cruise missiles
into the waters off its western coast earlier on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“We find [the actions] incredibly dangerous,” State Department Deputy
Spokesperson Vedant Patel told VOA during a briefing on Wednesday, while
declining to provide the U.S. assessment of North Korea’s
intentions.</p>
<p>This latest missile launch occurred just days after Pyongyang tested
a solid-fuel intermediate-range missile, equipped with a hypersonic
warhead, into waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.</p>
<p>“We harbor no hostile intent toward the DPRK and continue to be open
to diplomacy without preconditions,” Patel added. He was referring to
the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, which is North Korea’s
official name.</p>
<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has sharply criticized South Korea,
describing inter-Korean relations as a relationship between “two states
hostile to each other.”</p>
<p>A major monument in Pyongyang symbolizing the goal of reconciliation
with South Korea has been demolished, according to news reports citing
satellite imagery.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Kim labeled South Korea as a “primary foe and
invariable principal enemy,” stating that unification with South Korea
was no longer possible.</p>
<p>This stance is viewed by some analysts as a departure from North
Korea’s longstanding objective of reunifying the Korean Peninsula under
its control.</p>
<p>Pyongyang also continues to ignore Washington’s offers for dialogue
and remains averse to negotiating with Seoul.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have said they are disappointed by North Korea’s
continued rejection of dialogue and the escalation of its hostile
rhetoric toward South Korea. The United States said inter-Korean
cooperation is vital to achieving lasting peace on the Korean
Peninsula.</p>
<p>“We are eager to engage in substantive discussions on identifying
ways to not just manage military risk but create lasting peace on the
Korean Peninsula, as well as our continued stated goal of the complete
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” Patel said Wednesday.</p>
<p>At the Pentagon, Press Secretary Major General Patrick Ryder told
reporters on Tuesday that Washington has been very public in its
commitment to working with allies and partners “to deter and help
stabilize the security of the region.”</p>
<p>The U.S., Japan and South Korea have reaffirmed their commitment to
the complete denuclearization of the DPRK, in accordance with relevant
United Nations Security Council resolutions. The three countries also
urge the DPRK to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.</p>
<p>North Korea last launched cruise missiles in September 2023. Two
cruise missiles carrying mock nuclear warheads were fired toward the
Yellow Sea at that time.</p>
<p>The two Koreas have been divided since the Korean War ended in 1953.
They remain technically at war as the Korean War ended with a truce, not
a peace treaty.</p>

Investors For Its Gap Year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p>
2023 was the year Tesla decided it would sell a lot of cars, even if it
meant lowering prices. This year, however, Tesla may see “notably
slower” growth, the company warned Wednesday in an investor update.
</p>
<p>
Tesla argued it was “between two major growth waves.” The first saw the
rise of the Model 3 and Model Y, its more moderately priced sedan and
SUV which together made up over 95 percent of its total unit sales in
2023. “The next one we believe will be initiated by the global expansion
of the next-generation vehicle platform,” the company said, likely
referencing its rumored
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-redwood-iea-electricity" target="_blank">Redwood</a>”
vehicle that
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-plans-build-new-electric-vehicles-mid-2025-sources-2024-01-24/" target="_blank"><em>Reuters</em>
reported</a> the company wants to start producing in the middle of next
year.
</p>
<p>
The Model Y, Tesla said, is “the best-selling vehicle, of any kind,
globally” following its 1.2 million deliveries in 2023. “For a long
time, many doubted the viability of EVs. Today, the best-selling vehicle
on the planet is an EV,” Tesla’s investor update said.
</p>
<p>
The company also flagged that the continuing rollout of the Cybertruck,
which launched late last year, weighed on its profits. But the biggest
change for the company was the pursuit of lower prices. The company’s
$25.2 billion of revenues in the fourth quarter was due to “growth in
vehicle deliveries” — selling more cars — albeit at lower average
prices. So while revenue grew, it only grew 3% from a year ago.
</p>
<p>
Whether the electric vehicle sector as a whole is
slowing<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/are-ev-sales-really-slowing-data" target="_self">
is a matter of some debate</a>. But Tesla is clearly trying to figure
out what to do next, after successfully building up its business from
near-bankruptcy and selling 1.8 million cars per year. Before the
Cybertruck launch, it hadn’t refreshed its lineup in years and did not
provide a specific figure for how many vehicles it expects to sell in
2024. Historically its deliveries have risen around 50% a year, although
it “only” sold 38% more cars in 2023 than 2022.
</p>
<p>
Profits tell a similar story to its revenue: Tesla said that reduced
prices weighed on its profitability, as did increased spending on
artificial intelligence, especially its self-driving technology. It also
flagged that its battery business contributed to its overall profits.
</p>
<p>
The company’s earnings per share of 71 cents and its revenue of $25.2
billion were slightly short of Wall Street
estimates,<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-24/tesla-says-growth-rate-to-slow-in-2024-reports-earnings-miss?srnd=premium" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
according to <em>Bloomberg</em></a><em>.</em>
</p>
<p>
Tesla shares have been flagging this year, down 16 percent from the end
of last year and falling again in after-hours trading following the
release of its earnings report. The tech-heavy Nasdaq as a whole is up
around 5% this year.

<h2 id="can-the-us-do-more-to-help-ukraine">Can the US Do More to Help
Ukraine?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — As Ukrainian forces struggle to fend off Russia’s
invasion with dwindling supplies of rockets and other munitions, some
supporters are arguing that there is more the Biden administration could
do to re-arm them without waiting for long-delayed congressional
approval.</p>
<p>The administration’s request for $61.4 billion in new military
assistance is tied up in a partisan battle in Congress, where
Republicans have linked it to demands for a package of tough new
restrictions on migrants and asylum-seekers at America’s southern
border.</p>
<p>But some Ukraine advocates point out that the administration still
has previously approved authority to ship $4.2 billion worth of weapons
to Ukraine from its own stockpiles.</p>
<p>The catch: Without a new bill passing Congress, there is no money to
replenish the American stockpile, leaving questions about U.S. military
readiness and the country’s ability to respond to a crisis somewhere
else, such as Taiwan.</p>
<p>“There is no statutory requirement to replace equipment sent to
allies” under the Presidential Drawdown Authority approved by Congress
in December 2022, Mark Cancian, a former Office of Management and Budget
defense specialist, told Bloomberg.</p>
<p>He suggested that in theory, the Department of Defense can send
weapons and munitions to Ukraine without replenishment funds.</p>
<p>Money better spent in US, say critics</p>
<p>Pentagon spokesman Pat Ryder said the U.S. military understands the
severity of Ukraine’s needs, and that’s why it is working with Congress
to win approval for the supplemental funding.</p>
<p>“While we do have that $4.2 billion in authority, we don’t have the
funds available to replenish those stocks should we expend that,” he
explained at a briefing this month. “And with no timeline in sight, we
have to make those hard decisions.”</p>
<p>Critics of President Joe Biden’s $61.4 billion supplemental funding
request, which would also include aid for Israel and Taiwan, have argued
that the money could be better spent at home and that the
administration’s first priority should be securing the border with
Mexico, where record numbers of asylum-seekers have been crossing
illegally into the United States.</p>
<p>They have also called for greater transparency and accountability
concerning the $111 billion in weapons, equipment, humanitarian
assistance and other aid that has already been sent to Ukraine since
Russia’s full-scale invasion almost two years ago.</p>
<p>Reducing US supply worth it, say some </p>
<p>Some Ukraine supporters, however, argue that the risks of allowing
Russia to gain ground on the battlefield because of Ukrainian supply
shortages outweigh the risks of allowing the U.S. stockpile to be
temporarily reduced.</p>
<p>“Certainly at the moment, it would seem to be that the greatest risk
is one of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin gaining some battlefield
successes, certainly killing more Ukrainian civilians, if not gaining
advantage on the front lines,” said Scott Cullinane, director of
government relations at Razom, a U.S.-based Ukrainian diaspora
organization.</p>
<p>Cullinane told VOA Ukrainian he believes withholding military aid
sends a message of American weakness.</p>
<p>“It creates doubts in the minds of our Ukrainian partners that the
U.S. is willing to stand with them and makes an opening for Putin to
think he can outweigh us by simply extending the war,” he said.</p>
<p>Alexander Vindman, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel who was the
director for European affairs at the National Security Council, also
believes the risk of reducing the U.S. weapons stockpile is
overstated.</p>
<p>“The reality … is that the traditional Republican hawks will continue
investing in the U.S. defense,” the Ukrainian-born Vindman said in an
interview.</p>
<p>“They’re not going to take risks to the U.S. defense, especially when
it undermines this almost antiquated perception that the Republican
Party is good for defense, is good for the defense industry and is
supportive of the military.”</p>
<p>Vindman added that even if the administration did send the $4.2
billion of weapons to Ukraine immediately, it would cover that country’s
battlefield needs for no more than several weeks.</p>
<p>Michael Allen, a former special assistant to the president and senior
director at the National Security Council, argued that by not using its
remaining authority to help Ukraine, the Biden administration is
maintaining pressure on Congress to approve the full $61.4 billion
request.</p>
<p>“We want them to look at the funds that have been appropriated and
conclude that the Department of Defense is correct,” he told VOA
Ukrainian. “We need this urgently, so it’s good that the administration
is very clear about where they are.”</p>

article.</p>

<h2 id="users-first-then-do-teams">Users first then do teams</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
The heart of <a href="https://luroapp.com/">Luro</a> has always been a
tool to enable deeper collaboration in a broader team context, so we
architected it that way (a few times). It’s important that teams working
on the same app are able to
<a href="https://luroapp.com/posts/wrangling-saas/">look at the product
with the same lens of understanding</a>, not just through their own
silos. So teams were an early alpha feature of Luro.
</p>
<p>
I don’t regret choosing the teams path, but if I were building it all
over again I would heavily reconsider focusing on single users first and
then iterating towards team workspaces as the sales cycle starts
rolling. In ActiveRecord parlance…
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Stage 1: User <code>hasOne</code> Workspace - user can create a
workspace themselves ($)
</li>
<li>
Stage 2: User <code>hasMany</code> Workspaces - user can create many
workspaces themselves ($$)
</li>
<li>
Stage 3: User <code>hasAndBelongsToMany</code> Workspaces - user can
invite other users ($$$)
</li>
<li>
Stage 4: Workspace <code>belongsTo</code> Organization - org now owns
the workspace not a single user ($$$$)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This isn’t super innovative but there’s a multitude of benefits to this
approach:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Always useful</strong>: At each phase you have a product that is
useful to individual users, you’re never waiting on entire teams to
onboard for a feature to be useful.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Tighter feedback loop:</strong> It might be weeks or months
before you know a feature is working in a team
context<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>,
whereas single users have an instant “build → release → feedback” loop.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Value prop confidence</strong>: If it’s useful for
<code>one</code>, it’s probably useful to <code>many</code>.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Easier user personas</strong>: If you’re leveraging user
personas as abstractions, single users are easier to project whereas
teams are a compound of different personas.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Easier metrics:</strong> One user = one workspace has a lot less
dimensionality and calculus on how features are performing.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Faster path to revenue</strong>: If it’s useful, people will pay
for it. Getting a single user to swipe a credit card is easier than
getting a team thru a procurement process.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Straightforward payment integration</strong>: One user = one
subscription is easier than one team = subscription level × number of
seats, etc.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Revenue funds future development</strong>: Those single user
plans fund future development for team workspaces
</li>
<li>
<strong>Faster pricing validation</strong>: If you’re taking money,
you’ll find out what people are willing to pay real quick.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Easier conversations with VCs:</strong> Traction and revenue
projections are easier if you have paying customers, easy math to
abstract that to teams.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Easier self-service</strong>: <code>Sign up → Get
Workspace</code> is less steps than <code>Sign up → Create Org → Setup
Workspace → Invite Teammates → Manage permissions</code>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Less UI:</strong> No team picker, less onboarding, no user
management, no user dropdowns
</li>
<li>
<strong>Less code</strong>: You don’t need an invite token
system<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>,
logic flows to invite users to teams, and <code>lastViewedTeam</code>
state management.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Easier permission system</strong>: One user has access to all
items in one workspace, then add complexity as necessary rather than
starting with the complexity of an access control
system.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Easier testing:</strong> Testing invite and permission systems
is costly and time consuming to account for all the potential states.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Solve hard problems later:</strong> What happens when two people
edit the same document? You don’t have to solve problems like
multiplayer data consistency on day one.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Faster iteration</strong>: Less code, easier testing, clear
metrics, and pushing harder problems later in the process allows your
product to stay nimble while working on product market fit.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Less code and a faster pathway to revenue are probably the biggest
selling points to me. From a code standpoint you’d start with the most
simplistic payment system imaginable (aside from one-time charges), have
no invite system, and you’re delivering customer value the entire way.
It’s a less riskier position and a pragmatic approach to building
something with proven value over time.
</p>
<p>
That said, startups are risk taking ventures and are under pressure to
scale fast. There’s way more money in enterprise team sales than
individual sales. Multiplayer software like Slack, Discord, and Figma
make collaboration a joy. Like I said, I don’t regret the path we took
for Luro but for the reasons listed above I would heavily consider
making a personal product rather than one for teams in my next venture.

<h2 id="are-design-systems-a-zero-interest-rate-phenomenon">Are Design
Systems a zero-interest rate phenomenon?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
Last year, an investor we were talking to sent us a tweet that expressed
her hesitancy about investing in products in the design systems space
that went…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
#DesignSystems are a zero-interest rate phenomenon
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I dismissed this criticism as meme-of-the-day fodder. The idea behind
the “<code>[Trend]</code> is a zero-interest rate phenomenon” meme is
that <code>[Trend]</code> is only feasible when money is cheap to borrow
or acquire. Examples of other zero-interest rate phenomenon from
X-dot-com: Airbnb, DEI, React, and so on. Any <code>[Trend]</code> that
costs more than it makes or has an indirect relationship to the profit
machine is at risk.
</p>
<p>
Since that investor call and after months feeling the stale tech market,
this idea resurfaced in my brain. I put value in design systems because
I know there’s value in design systems, ergo there’s value in design
systems. This logic is a perfect circle! It can’t be wrong.
</p>
<h2>
So are design systems a zero-interest rate phenomenon?
</h2>
<p>
No. Well, maybe. Depends on who you ask. If I need to build 5-10 pages,
I can do those one at a time without much of a system. If I need to
create or update hundreds or thousands of pages, or five different
applications, then I need a system of components so that when I traverse
those projects I don’t have to read a ten thousand page mystery to
understand what the hell is going on. A handful (20~30) trusty
components with some state-driven variants can power infinite
applications with perfect consistency in a relatively short amount of
time. That is certainly valuable.
</p>
<p>
To pull this off design should be working in components, development
should also be in components, design and code should match, and it
should all be well-documented, no problems, easy, dogs and cats living
together! Turns out, not that easy. Behind the scenes it’s a lot of
“getting on the same page” meetings and getting buy-in from the
higher-ups.
</p>
<p>
“You’re going to spend how many months making components?”<br /> “A
lot.”<br /> “And the app is going to look different?”<br /> “Nope. Not
if I do my job right.” (finger guns)
</p>
<p>
There’s no particular “hair on fire” problem that design systems solve
that instantly sells to management. This can be frustrating to design
system practitioners because we understand the intrinsic benefits of
consistent UI over one-off solutions and maintenance nightmares. We
trade immediacy in the short term for predictability over the long tail.
In that way, design systems are a <em>proactive</em> solution to a whole
host of <em>likely</em> problems down the road. Thus only
forward-looking organizations can invest in design systems and to be
forward-looking you probably need extra cash on hand… which might make
it a zero-interest rate phenomenon.
</p>
<p>
But I believe design systems are an entirely different phenomenon all
together. Times I’ve seen executive buy-in go smoothest are when a
person in a position of power cares about design and says, “Our app
looks like shit.” Now it’s a hair on fire problem.
</p>
<h2>
Design systems are an event-triggered phenomenon
</h2>
<p>
In Dungeons &amp; Dragons and other action economies there’s a concept
of “Event Triggers”. For example, a treasure chest looks like a normal
treasure chest but turns into a monster when you try to open it. An
event (opening the chest) exposed a problem (a monster) and now you need
a solution (might and magic) to solve the problem. Design systems are a
similar mechanic because the problems they solve are almost theoretical
until you trigger an event.
</p>
<p>
Here’s some event triggers I’ve come across in my years of design
systems work…
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Marketing commissioned a new logo, brand, and design language
</li>
<li>
Oh, those brand updates rolling out in TV commercials next month
</li>
<li>
Oh, and we’re launching a new line of hardware tablet devices
</li>
<li>
The great re-platforming initiative
</li>
<li>
An accessibility lawsuit
</li>
<li>
A font license lawsuit
</li>
<li>
Good design, poor code implementation
</li>
<li>
Interface inventory reveals 60 different buttons and 12 site headers
</li>
<li>
The CEO gets fired and you need to remove his face from the entire site
</li>
<li>
10 designers with high autonomy and no design review process
</li>
<li>
10 engineers with high autonomy and no design review on code changes
</li>
<li>
One department with more autonomy than the other because it “makes the
money”
</li>
<li>
Company wholesaled the entire off-shore team and 150 new people start
next week
</li>
<li>
A year of heavy turnover and
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2020/11/technical-debt-as-a-lack-of-understanding/">the
time bomb of technical debt</a> goes off
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once your party has stepped on a trigger and encountered a monster, the
desire to be more proactive and prepared next time goes up. I’d love to
know your design system dungeon crawling stories but the lesson is this:
Design systems become a “hair on fire” problem and get buy-in when
people in the organization encounter a catastrophic or near-catastrophic
event. Design systems are not a cure-all, but they are an aspirin for a
very common set of headaches.

<h2 id="biden-is-endorsed-by-united-auto-workers-in-2024-election">Biden
Is Endorsed by United Auto Workers in 2024 Election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden picked up the endorsement of
the United Auto Workers on Wednesday as he addressed the powerful
union’s political convention.</p>
<p>Biden, a Democrat, is pushing to sway blue-collar workers his way in
critical automaking swing states such as Michigan and Wisconsin, hoping
to cut into the advantage that Republican former President Donald Trump
has enjoyed with white voters who don’t have a college degree.</p>
<p>Labor experts said that the UAW usually endorses candidates later as
it has a mix of Democratic, Republican and unaffiliated voters.</p>
<p>“This November we can stand up and elect someone who stands with us
and supports our cause, or we can elect someone who will divide us and
fight us every step of the way. That’s what this choice is about,” UAW
President Shawn Fain said in announcing Biden’s endorsement.</p>
<p>Biden will speak as the union closes out a three-day gathering in
Washington to chart its political priorities. It will be his first
political event since Tuesday’s primary vote in New Hampshire, where
Trump cemented his hold on core Republican voters with a victory and
Biden scored a write-in win.</p>
<p>Biden frequently bills himself as the most labor-friendly leader in
American history, and he went so far as to turn up on a picket line with
union workers at a GM parts warehouse in the Detroit area during a
strike last fall.</p>
<p>“He heard the call, and he stood up and he showed up,” Fain said of
Biden’s historic picket line appearance. He drew a contrast between
Biden’s pro-union efforts and Trump, who he said was anti-union.</p>
<p>As recently as Monday, Fain was restrained in his comments, saying as
the conference opened, “We have to make our political leaders stand up
with us. Support our cause, or you will not get our endorsement.”</p>
<p>At this week’s conference, support for Biden among union members has
varied from enthusiastic to uncertainty about whether to even vote come
Election Day.</p>
<p>Caroline Loveless, a Waterloo, Iowa, resident and retired UAW member,
said she would enthusiastically vote for Biden, recalling his appearance
on a picket line during last fall’s strike. She said his appearance
should remind union members that Biden is on their side.</p>
<p>“I hope they don’t get amnesia,” Loveless said, “come Election
Day.”</p>
<p>William Louis, of Groton, Connecticut, another member, said that
while he is “fed up with politicians,” he will reluctantly vote for
Biden, although he said the president had not fully earned members’ vote
given the current state of the economy.</p>
<p>Louis said Biden would get his vote because Trump, the likely
Republican nominee, “was a terrible president.”</p>
<p>Leo Carrillo, a member from Kansas City, said Biden’s appearance on
the picket line showed that “he was there for us,” and helped him to
decide to vote for Biden in November.</p>
<p>“For me it meant a lot” that a sitting president would show that
level of solidarity to autoworkers, Carrillo said. “But there’s more
work to be done,” he said, pointing to the PRO Act — proposed
legislation that would make it easier to unionize on a federal level.
The legislation advanced to the U.S. Senate but does not have enough
support to survive in case of a filibuster.</p>
<p>Biden could run into dissent, however, over his support for Israel in
its war on Hamas in Gaza. Some younger members of the union were less
enthusiastic about the president for that reason.</p>
<p>Johannah King-Slutzky, a Columbia University graduate student and
member of the student workers union within the UAW, was one of several
attendees who chanted “cease fire now” during Fain’s afternoon speech
Monday. The union called for a cease fire in Gaza in December.</p>
<p>“Right now, he’s done nothing to earn my vote,” King-Slutzky said,
because “he has not acted with urgency to stop the genocide in
Gaza.”</p>
<p>The UAW has roughly 380,000 members.</p>

Military Says It Fended Off Another Houthi Missile Attack</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Iran-backed Houthi militants launched new attacks
Wednesday on merchant shipping in the Gulf of Aden, just hours after the
United States carried out preemptive strikes to stave off what it said
was an imminent attack on shipping lanes in the Red Sea. </p>
<p>U.S. Central Command, which overseas U.S. forces in the Middle East,
said late Wednesday that a U.S. guided missile destroyer shot down two
anti-ship ballistic missiles aimed at the M/V Maersk Detroit, a
U.S.-owned and operated container ship transiting the Gulf of Aden. </p>
<p>A third missile fell into the sea.  </p>
<p>U.S. officials said that while the latest attack did not cause any
injuries or damage to the container ship, it shows the Houthis are not
ready to back down. </p>
<p>“If they don’t stop, we will continue to take necessary action,”
Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told VOA in an interview
Wednesday. “But our goal here is not to see escalation. It’s actually
the opposite. It’s to deescalate the situation and ensure that
international shipping and mariners can transit this waterway
safely.”</p>
<p>Hours before the latest attack Wednesday, the U.S. launched
preemptive strikes in Houthi-controlled Yemen, destroying two anti-ship
missiles allegedly set to target international shipping in the Red
Sea. </p>
<p>The missiles “presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and
the U.S. Navy ships in the region,” according to a U.S. Central Command
statement. </p>
<p>The latest round of U.S. preemptive strikes and Houthi attacks follow
Monday’s barrage by U.S. and British warplanes, ships and submarines
aimed at degrading the ability of the Houthis to maintain their
months-long assault on key shipping lanes in the region.</p>
<p>U.S. defense officials said Monday’s strikes hit multiple targets
across eight locations, including an underground storage facility as
well as missile launch sites and other locations linked to Houthi
surveillance capabilities. </p>
<p>“These precision strikes … are in response to a series of illegal,
dangerous and destabilizing Houthi actions,” the U.S. and Britain said
in a statement at the time, noting the latest strikes were carried out
with the support of Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands. </p>
<p>In a sign of continued tensions, the United Nations confirmed
Wednesday that the Houthis, a U.S.-designated terror group, have given
it one month to withdraw all U.S. and British staff from
Houthi-controlled areas. </p>
<p>“What needs to be said is that any request or requirement for U.N.
staff to leave — based solely on the nationality of that staff — is
inconsistent with the legal framework applicable to the U.N.,” said U.N.
spokesperson Stephane Dujarric. </p>
<p>“It also, of course, impedes our ability to deliver on the mandate to
support all of the people of Yemen,” he added. </p>
<p>The Red Sea route carries about 15% of the world’s maritime traffic.
Major shipping companies have responded to the attacks by rerouting
vessels on the longer and more expensive route around Africa. </p>
<p>Since mid-November, the Houthis have launched at least 34 attacks on
international shipping lanes, justifying them by saying they are acting
in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza under attack from Israel. </p>
<p>But U.S. officials say many of the Houthi attacks have targeted ships
that are not associated with Israel. </p>
<p>The rising tensions involving the U.S., its allies, other countries
and the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen come as the U.S. also seeks to
deter other Iran-backed groups in the region. </p>
<p>Early Wednesday, U.S. military aircraft hit Iran-backed proxies in
western Iraq in response to a series of attacks against U.S. and
coalition forces in recent days. </p>
<p>U.S. officials said the airstrikes targeted three facilities used by
Kataib Hezbollah and other Iranian proxy groups in al-Qaim, Jurf al
Sakhar, and one other location. </p>
<p>“These strikes targeted KH [Kataib Hezbollah] headquarters, storage,
and training locations for rocket, missile, and one-way attack UAV
[unmanned aerial vehicle] capabilities,” according to an initial
statement from U.S. Central Command. </p>
<p>National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday that
early battle damage assessments have indicated the strikes were
successful. </p>
<p>He also further described one of the targets as an intelligence
facility.</p>
<p>The U.S. strikes in Iraq came after one by Iran-backed militants on
Ain al-Asad air base in western Iraq with one-way attack drones. </p>
<p>The base was also targeted Saturday by a barrage of ballistic
missiles launched from inside Iraq. While most of the missiles were shot
down, the Pentagon said those that landed on the base caused traumatic
brain injuries in four U.S. personnel. </p>
<p>There have been more than 150 attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and
Syria since the October 7 Hamas terror attack against Israel, injuring
at least 83 Americans, a U.S. defense official told VOA. All but two
have returned to duty.</p>

Sweden’s NATO bid, moving along in the process. </p>
<p>“We look forward to (Turkish) President (Tayyip) Erdogan taking…steps
he needs to within that system to formally finalize that process as well
as we look forward to receiving Turkey’s instrument of ratification … in
Washington,” Patel said. </p>
<p>“And we look forward to our Hungarian partners also moving along on
this process also.” </p>
<p>Turkey’s parliament ratified Sweden’s NATO membership bid on Tuesday,
clearing the biggest remaining hurdle to expanding the Western military
alliance after 20 months of delay, leaving Hungary as the only NATO
member yet to ratify the accession. </p>
<p>All NATO members need to approve applications from countries seeking
to join the alliance. When Sweden and Finland asked to join in 2022,
Turkey raised objections over what it said was the two countries’
protection of groups it deems terrorists. </p>
<p>It endorsed Finland’s membership in April last year but, along with
Hungary, had kept Sweden waiting. </p>
<p>Erdogan is expected to sign the legislation within days. </p>
<p>Turkey’s ratification of Sweden’s NATO bid and the U.S. sale of F-16
fighter jets to Turkey have become linked over the past years. The Biden
administration has said it supports the sale but kept urging Ankara to
approve Sweden’s NATO bid saying Congress might be connecting the two
issues. </p>
<p>When asked on Wednesday if the State Department would send the formal
notification for the jets once Sweden’s NATO process is fully
formalized, Patel did not commit to a timeline. </p>
<p>“President Biden, Secretary Blinken have been very clear of our
support for modernizing Turkey’s F-16 fleet, which we view as a key
investment in NATO interoperability. But beyond that, we also recognize
that Congress has a key role in reviewing arms sales, but I’m just not
going to confirm or get ahead of proposed defense sales or transfers
until they are formally notified to Congress.”</p>

<h2 id="what-can-a-website-do">What Can a Website Do?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
Sarah Hendren’s <a href="https://amzn.to/3LWGiAS"><em>What Can a Body
Do?</em></a> is a beautiful meditation on disability and the different
ways bodies meet the physical world. In a word, there’s often a
“mismatch” between how the world is designed and how people interact
with it. There’s a chapter in the book where Hendren talks about a
non-profit workshop that helps fabricate physical tools and
accommodations for people with disabilities, when I read it I almost
quit tech entirely.
</p>
<p>
The workshop made tables, modified wheel chairs, and other bespoke
objects. The idea of joining an organization like that lit up my neural
network. Working with actual people, hearing their needs, working
together on their problems, to help design and build a objects to allow
people to succeed at whatever task (no matter how big or small) that
they want to do… that sounded like fulfilling work.
</p>
<p>
For months I’d fantasize about quitting tech and making accessible
objects. A friend of mine works at Texas School for the Blind and
Visually Impaired (TSBVI) and he told me about how they 3D print objects
like charts and graphs or the inside of a cell to help the kids
understand visual concepts. What a novel use of technology! Fabricating
accommodations for kids sounds fun. And projects like
<em><a href="https://www.rampur.is/">Ramp Up Reykjavík</a></em> which
has expanded to <em>Ramp Up Iceland</em> and now to <em>Ramp Up
Europe</em> broadens my imagination for what’s possible.
</p>
<p>
Then I realized… wait a minute… I make websites. Websites are already a
surface area with a notorious amount of mismatch for people with
disabilities. In a world where
<a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/">96.3% of the top
1,000,000 homepages have detectable errors</a>, there’s a lot of work to
do. Maybe I don’t need to quit my job, instead I could:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Fix errors on the sites I work on (doing this)
</li>
<li>
Help educate other web developers on accessibility (doing this)
</li>
<li>
Build tooling to help other web developers fix their errors (doing this)
</li>
<li>
Work with standards groups to propose new accessible HTML (tried this)
</li>
<li>
Meet more often with folks who have disabilities and listen to their
concerns (need to do this)
</li>
<li>
Build bespoke apps or tools for people?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That last one… In the same way the little workshop builds from the book
bespoke accommodations, is it possible to build bespoke apps and browser
extensions to help bodies meet the digital world? I use my web developer
superpowers ✨ to hack websites or build small apps for myself all the
time. Why not offer this skill to other people?
</p>
<p>
One inspiration for how this might work is from Blake Watson’s talk
“<a href="https://blakewatson.com/journal/magnoliajs-2023-the-joys-of-home-cooked-apps/">The
joys of home-cooked apps</a>”. In the talk Blake shares a handful of
side projects he’s built as workarounds for his spinal muscular atrophy.
From digi-fying a card game, to a custom DnD character sheet, to a
Markdown-to-spreadsheet generator to manage his caretakers, to
<a href="https://afinestart.me/">a classy browser startup screen</a>;
Blake is using his programming superpowers to help his body meet his
world. Blake’s tenacity for
<a href="https://blakewatson.com/journal/finishing-side-projects/">finishing
side projects</a> and creating good, small, clear-intentioned apps
motivates me.
</p>
<p>
In the spirit of chasing this idea, I reached out to TSBVI and they
offered a tour of their campus and makerspace. It’s a wonderful place
with
<a href="https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/genki-meaning/"><em>genki</em></a>
kids and the art on the walls is tactile and meant to for touch. One
issue they specifically called out was that the Prussa Slicer app used
by their 3D printers is inaccessible
(<a href="https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/7595">missing
labels and a focus trap problem</a>). That’s blocking kids from being
able to make prints on their without sighted assistance. It’s a shame
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/01/accessible-fart-machines/">when
kids with disabilities miss out on the fun</a>. I don’t know how to
write GUIs in C++, nor do I know how the
<a href="https://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a> framework it uses
works, nor can I build the project locally… so I might not be the
candidate to fix this particular issue… but maybe you are? Or maybe
you’re the person who could help me? If this sounds like you, please
reach out. I know some kids who could use your help.

id="proud-boys-member-sentenced-to-6-years-in-prison-for-capitol-riot-role-after-berating-judge">Proud
Boys Member Sentenced to 6 Years in Prison for Capitol Riot Role After
Berating Judge</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A man who stormed the U.S. Capitol with fellow Proud
Boys extremist group members was sentenced on Wednesday to six years in
prison after he berated and insulted the judge who punished him.</p>
<p>Marc Bru repeatedly interrupted Chief Judge James Boasberg before he
handed down the sentence, calling him a “clown” and a “fraud” presiding
over a “kangaroo court.” The judge warned Bru that he could be kicked
out of the courtroom if he continued to disrupt the proceedings.</p>
<p>“You can give me 100 years and I’d do it all over again,” said Bru,
who was handcuffed and shackled.</p>
<p>“That’s the definition of no remorse in my book,” the judge said.</p>
<p>Prosecutors described Bru as one of the least remorseful rioters who
assaulted the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. They say Bru planned for an armed
insurrection — a “January 6 2.0” attack — to take over the government in
Portland, Oregon, several weeks after the deadly riot in Washington,
D.C.</p>
<p>“He wanted a repeat of January 6, only he implied this time would be
more violent,” prosecutors wrote in a court filing ahead of his
sentencing.</p>
<p>Bru has been representing himself with an attorney on standby. He has
spewed anti-government rhetoric that appears to be inspired by the
sovereign citizen movement. At the start of the hearing, Bru demanded
that the judge and a prosecutor turn over five years of their financial
records.</p>
<p>The judge gave him a 10-minute break to confer with his standby
lawyer before the hearing resumed with more interruptions.</p>
<p>“I don’t accept any of your terms and conditions,” Bru said. “You’re
a clown and not a judge.”</p>
<p>Prosecutors had warned the court that Bru intended to disrupt his
sentencing. On Tuesday, he called in to a nightly vigil outside the jail
where he and other rioters are being held. He told supporters of the
detained Jan. 6 defendants that he would “try to put on a good show” at
his sentencing.</p>
<p>Boasberg convicted Bru of seven charges, including two felonies,
after hearing trial testimony without a jury in October.</p>
<p>Prosecutors recommended a prison sentence of seven years and three
months for Bru, a resident of Washington state.</p>
<p>“Bru appears to have envisioned and been planning for a true armed
insurrection, and from his post-conviction comments, he appears only to
have become further radicalized and angry since then,” they wrote.</p>
<p>Bru absconded before his trial, skipped two court hearings and
“defiantly boasted via Twitter that the government would have to come
get him if it wanted him.”</p>
<p>“Approximately a month later, it did,” prosecutors added.</p>
<p>Bru represented himself at his bench trial but didn’t present a
defense. Instead, he repeatedly proclaimed that he refused to “consent”
to the trial and “showed nothing but contempt for the Court and the
government,” prosecutors wrote.</p>
<p>Bru flew from Portland, Oregon to Washington a day before
then-President Donald Trump’s “Stop the Steal” rally near the White
House. Before Trump’s speech, he joined dozens of other Proud Boys in
marching to the Capitol and was one of the first rioters to breach a
restricted area near Peace Circle.</p>
<p>Bru grabbed a barricade and shoved it against police officers. He
later joined other rioters inside the Capitol and entered the Senate
gallery, where he flashed a hand gesture associated with the Proud Boys
as he posed for selfie photos. He spent roughly 13 minutes inside the
building.</p>
<p>Several weeks after the riot, Bru exchanged text messages with a
friend about buying gas masks in bulk. He also texted a Proud Boys
recruit and indicated that he wanted to “repeat the violence and
lawlessness of January 6 in Portland in order to take over the local
government,” prosecutors said.</p>
<p>“In fact, those text messages indicate that Bru’s chief takeaway from
January 6 is that it was not violent enough or not sufficiently
dedicated to overthrowing the government,” prosecutors wrote. “In other
words, in the aftermath of January 6, Bru was plotting an armed
insurrection, not feeling remorseful.”</p>
<p>The FBI initially arrested Bru in March 2021 in Vancouver,
Washington. After his pretrial release, Bru was charged with separate
drunken driving-related offenses in Idaho and Montana.</p>
<p>In July, Bru was secretly living in Montana when a drunken driver hit
his car. Police officers who responded to the collision arrested Bru on
a warrant stemming from his failure to appear in court before trial. He
has “continued to spew disinformation” from jail since his re-arrest and
trial, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>“If anything, he appears to be growing more defiant and radicalized,”
they wrote.</p>
<p>More than 1,200 people have been charged with Capitol riot-related
crimes. About 900 have pleaded guilty or been convicted after trials.
Over 750 have been sentenced, with roughly two-thirds receiving some
term of imprisonment, according to data compiled by The Associated
Press.</p>

id="british-billionaire-pleads-guilty-in-us-insider-trading-case">British
Billionaire Pleads Guilty in US Insider Trading Case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — British billionaire Joe Lewis, whose family trust owns the
Tottenham Hotspur soccer club, pleaded guilty Wednesday to insider
trading and conspiracy charges in New York. </p>
<p>The 86-year-old businessman entered the plea in Manhattan federal
court six months after he was charged in the case. He had been free on
$300 million bail, with a yacht and private plane serving as
collateral. </p>
<p>Lewis did not speak as he left court, and he was shielded from
photographers by his aides, a lawyer and an umbrella. </p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said the plea deal includes the largest
financial penalty for insider trading in a decade. </p>
<p>Broad Bay Limited, which Lewis owns, will pay more than $50 million
in financial penalties, the prosecutor said in a release. </p>
<p>“Today’s guilty pleas once again confirm — as I said in announcing
the charges against Joseph Lewis just six months ago – the law applies
to everyone, no matter who you are or how much wealth you have,”
Williams said. </p>
<p>He said Lewis abused inside information he gathered from corporate
boardrooms to tip off his friends, employees and romantic
interests. </p>
<p>Federal sentencing guidelines call for a prison sentence of between
18 and 24 months, although Lewis can seek less than that. His sentencing
hearing is scheduled for March 28. </p>
<p>As part of the guilty plea, Lewis and Broad Bay Limited have agreed
that Lewis and his companies will resign and surrender control over
board seats and participation in board meetings for any corporation
publicly traded in the United States. They also agreed to quit ownership
of certain investments over the five-year period of probation and to
cooperate with the U.S. government’s ongoing investigation and
prosecution. </p>
<p>Lewis has a fortune that Forbes estimates at $6.1 billion and assets
in real estate, biotechnology, energy and agriculture. He bought an
interest in Tottenham Hotspur, one of England’s most storied soccer
clubs, in 2001. </p>
<p>Under his ownership, the Premier League club built a state-of-the-art
stadium at an estimated cost of more than $1 billion. </p>
<p>Today, a trust benefiting members of Lewis’ family is the majority
owner of ENIC, the holding company that owns the team. Lewis himself is
not a beneficiary of that trust and relinquished operational control of
the club in October 2022, according to corporate filings. </p>
<p>Lewis’ Tavistock Group owns all or parts of over 200 companies
worldwide, according to its website, and his art collection boasts works
by Picasso, Matisse and Degas. His business connections include Tiger
Woods, Ernie Els and Justin Timberlake, with whom he built a Bahamian
oceanside resort that opened in 2010. </p>
<p>According to the indictment against him, Lewis’ investments in
various companies gave him control of board seats, where he placed
associates who let him know what they learned behind the scenes.
Prosecutors said Lewis improperly shared confidential information
between 2019 and 2021 to his chosen recipients and urged them to profit
from the tips.</p>

<h2 id="the-largest-dam-removal-in-u.s.-history-has-begun">The Largest
Dam Removal in U.S. History Has Begun</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTE0OTUwMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcwOTQ0NDE1NX0.Tb5zH6GJJo6LAvCwDxcR19cG38XbAwPhF4c_7eXyqZE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
The largest dam removal project in American history took an irreversible
step forward earlier this month when crews opened a 16-foot-wide tunnel
in the base of the Iron Gate Dam in Hornbrook, California. That event
marked the beginning of the end of a decades-long effort to restore the
Klamath River, which snakes for more than 250 miles through Oregon and
California, to a new natural state.
</p>
<p>
“This is historic and life-changing, and it means that the Yurok people
have a future,” Amy Cordalis, a member of the Yurok tribe and one of the
leaders of the effort to remove the dams,
<a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1224494403" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told
NPR</a>. “It means the river has a future, the salmon have a future.”
</p>
<p>
Members of the Yurok, Karuk, Hoopa, Shasta, and Klamath peoples, among
others, have long worked to convince federal regulators that the four
dams on the river — Iron Gate, Copco 1, Copco 2, and JC Boyle — have
done more harm than good. Originally built a century ago as part of a
hydropower
<a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/cadillac-desert-the-american-west-and-its-disappearing-water-revised-edition-marc-reisner/11588553" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">development
blitz</a> in the American West, they blocked salmon and steelhead trout
from reaching their habitats, decimating fish populations and robbing
the tribal nations of a vital food source. The dams quickly outlived
their usefulness: The amount of power they produce is negligible
compared to the needs of the region today.
</p>
<p>
Copco 2, the smallest of the four dams, came down last fall; that one
didn’t have a reservoir, which made it relatively easy to remove. Over
the next few months, Iron Gate, Copco 1, and JC Boyle will all have
their reservoirs drained, returning the river water to levels not seen
since the early 20th century. By the fall, the last vestiges of the dams
should be off the river.
</p>
<p>
The tribes have big plans for what comes next. An immense effort —
funded, at least in part, by
<a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2023/03/01/klamath-basin-restoration-bipartisan-infrastructure-law/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">millions
of dollars</a> from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law — is underway to
revegetate the more than 2,200 acres of land that will be exposed when
the reservoirs are empty, and with more than 17 billion seeds slated for
planting and at least a thousand trees ready to be flown in by
helicopter. Over time, the river will slowly turn back into the vibrant,
free-flowing ecosystem it once was.
</p>
<p>
Those who were on-site when the tunnel was opened this month described
seeing “chocolate-milk-brown water,” a
“<a href="https://www.heraldandnews.com/basin_ag_news/drawdown-begins-kwua-visits-iron-gate-dam-to-witness-historic-event/article_1defb6da-b985-11ee-986e-337d40f59ceb.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dark
purge</a>” containing both water and sediment flow through the dam.
Sediment is an
<a href="https://www.hydroreview.com/world-regions/north-america/dealing-with-sediment-effects-on-dams-and-hydropower-generation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">existential
problem</a>, and not just for the dams in the Klamath river — human-made
barriers prevent silt from traveling downriver, and the sediment
buildups block dams’ release gates, reducing their ability to both
generate electricity and release water. This also affects downstream
ecosystems, which evolved with a steady supply of fertile new soil. Once
enough sediment builds up, a dam becomes practically useless.
</p>
<p>
The removal of the Iron Gate dam, then, is not just a service to the
Native peoples and ecosystems along California’s second-largest river.
It’s also the solution to a problem that has quite literally been
building for decades.
</p>
<p>
“Being able to look at the river flow for the first time in more than
100 years, it’s incredibly important to us,” Frankie Myers, vice chair
of the Yurok Tribe,
<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/klamath-river-dams-18592696.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told
the San Francisco Chronicle</a>. “It’s what we’ve been fighting for: to
see the river for itself.”

an ext4 linux USB drive on macOS in 2024</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently pulled a SATA hard drive out of a Linux box that I wanted to grab some files off of. I only had my Mac on hand, and I had a USB 3.0 to SATA hard drive adapter at the ready.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
But when I plugged in the hard drive, macOS said it couldn’t recognize
the disk.

<p>
<img width="500" height="auto" class="insert-image" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/disk-unreadable-mac.jpeg" alt="Disk unreadable by macOS" />
</p>
<p>
Makes sense, because macOS includes support for Apple’s filesystems, not
Linux (or even NTFS, Windows’ preferred filesystem). There are
commercial solutions you can buy, like Paragon Software’s
<a href="https://www.paragon-drivers.com/en/extfsmac/">extFS for
Mac</a>, but that costs $39, and I don’t want to deal with the licensing
issues that may exist there if I just want to grab a few files off one
hard drive.
</p>
<p>
Luckily, there are some open source libraries that allow at least
<em>read only</em> access to ext4-formatted disks on macOS. Let’s
install them and use them to mount the drive:

<p>
First, install <a href="https://osxfuse.github.io">macfuse</a>, using

How lock-in hurts design (24 Jan 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links How lock-in hurts design: Felonizing the desire path.
Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004,
2014, 2019, 2024 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent
appearances, current writing projects, current reading How lock-in hurts
design (permalink) If you’ve ever read about design, you’ve probably
encountered the idea of “paving the desire path.” A “desire path” is an
erosion path created by people departing from the official walkway and
taking their own route. The story goes that smart campus planners don’t
fight the desire paths laid down by students; they pave them,
formalizing the route that their constituents have voted for with their
feet. Desire paths aren’t always great (Wikipedia notes that “desire
paths sometimes cut through sensitive habitats and exclusion zones,
threatening wildlife and park security”), but in the context of design,
a desire path is a way that users communicate with designers, creating a
feedback loop between those two groups. The designers make a product,
the users use it in ways that surprise the designer, and the designer
integrates all that into a new revision of the product. This method is
widely heralded as a means of “co-innovating” between users and
companies. Designers who practice the method are lauded for their
humility, their willingness to learn from their users. Tech history is
strewn with examples of successful paved desire-paths. Take John Deere.
While today the company is notorious for its war on its customers (via
its opposition to right to repair), Deere was once a leader in
co-innovation, dispatching roving field engineers to visit farms and
learn how farmers had modified their tractors. The best of these
modifications would then be worked into the next round of tractor
designs, in a virtuous cycle:
https://securityledger.com/2019/03/opinion-my-grandfathers-john-deere-would-support-our-right-to-repair/
But this pattern is even more pronounced in the digital world, because
it’s much easier to update a digital service than it is to update all
the tractors in the field, especially if that service is cloud-based,
meaning you can modify the back-end everyone is instantly updated. The
most celebrated example of this co-creation is Twitter, whose users
created a host of its core features. Retweets, for example, were a user
creation. Users who saw something they liked on the service would type
“RT” and paste the text and the link into a new tweet composition
window. Same for quote-tweets: users copied the URL for a tweet and
pasted it in below their own commentary. Twitter designers observed this
user innovation and formalized it, turning it into part of Twitter’s
core feature-set. Companies are obsessed with discovering digital desire
paths. They pay fortunes for analytics software to produce maps of how
their users interact with their services, run focus groups, even embed
sneaky screen-recording software into their web-pages:
https://www.wired.com/story/the-dark-side-of-replay-sessions-that-record-your-every-move-online/
This relentless surveillance of users is pursued in the name of making
things better for them: let us spy on you and we’ll figure out where
your pain-points and friction are coming from, and remove those. We all
win! But this impulse is a world apart from the humility and respect
implied by co-innovation. The constant, nonconsensual observation of
users has more to do with controlling users than learning from them.
That is, after all, the ethos of modern technology: the more control a
company can exert over its users ,the more value it can transfer from
those users to its shareholders. That’s the key to enshittification, the
ubiquitous platform decay that has degraded virtually all the technology
we use, making it worse every day:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/twiddler/ When you are seeking to
control users, the desire paths they create are all too frequently a
means to wrestling control back from you. Take advertising: every time a
service makes its ads more obnoxious and invasive, it creates an
incentive for its users to search for “how do I install an ad-blocker”:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/adblocking-how-about-nah More than
half of all web-users have installed ad-blockers. It’s the largest
consumer boycott in human history:
https://doc.searls.com/2023/11/11/how-is-the-worlds-biggest-boycott-doing/
But zero app users have installed ad-blockers, because
reverse-engineering an app requires that you bypass its encryption,
triggering liability under Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act. This law provides for a $500,000 fine and a 5-year prison
sentence for “circumvention” of access controls:
https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/12/youre-holding-it-wrong/#if-dishwashers-were-iphones
Beyond that, modifying an app creates liability under copyright,
trademark, patent, trade secrets, noncompete, nondisclosure and so on.
It’s what Jay Freeman calls “felony contempt of business model”:
https://locusmag.com/2020/09/cory-doctorow-ip/ This is why services are
so horny to drive you to install their app rather using their websites:
they are trying to get you to do something that, given your druthers,
you would prefer not to do. They want to force you to exit through the
gift shop, you want to carve a desire path straight to the parking lot.
Apps let them mobilize the law to literally criminalize those desire
paths. An app is just a web-page wrapped in enough IP to make it a
felony to block ads in it (or do anything else that wrestles value back
from a company). Apps are web-pages where everything not forbidden is
mandatory. Seen in this light, an app is a way to wage war on desire
paths, to abandon the cooperative model for co-innovation in favor of
the adversarial model of user control and extraction. Corporate
apologists like to claim that the proliferation of apps proves that
users like them. Neoliberal economists love the idea that business as
usual represents a “revealed preference.” This is an intellectually
unserious tautology: “you do this, so you must like it”:
https://boingboing.net/2024/01/22/hp-ceo-says-customers-are-a-bad-investment-unless-they-can-be-made-to-buy-companys-drm-ink-cartridges.html
Calling an action where no alternatives are permissible a “preference”
or a “choice” is a cheap trick – especially when considered against the
“preferences” that reveal themselves when a real choice is possible.
Take commercial surveillance: when Apple gave Ios users a choice about
being spied on – a one-click opt of of app-based surveillance – 96% of
users choice no spying:
https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/96-of-us-users-opt-out-of-app-tracking-in-ios-14-5-analytics-find/
But then Apple started spying on those very same users that had opted
out of spying by Facebook and other Apple competitors:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/14/luxury-surveillance/#liar-liar
Neoclassical economists aren’t just obsessed with revealed preferences –
they also love to bandy about the idea of “moral hazard”: economic
arrangements that tempt people to be dishonest. This is typically
applied to the public (“consumers” in the contemptuous parlance of
econospeak). But apps are pure moral hazard – for corporations. The
ability to prohibit desire paths – and literally imprison rivals who
help your users thwart those prohibitions – is too tempting for
companies to resist. The fact that the majority of web users block ads
reveals a strong preference for not being spied on (“users just want
relevant ads” is such an obvious lie that doesn’t merit any serious
discussion):
https://www.iccl.ie/news/82-of-the-irish-public-wants-big-techs-toxic-algorithms-switched-off/
Giant companies attained their scale by learning from their users, not
by thwarting them. The person using technology always knows something
about what they need to do and how they want to do it that the designers
can never anticipate. This is especially true of people who are unlike
those designers – people who live on the other side of the world, or the
other side of the economic divide, or whose bodies don’t work the way
that the designers’ bodies do:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/20/benevolent-dictators/#felony-contempt-of-business-model
Apps – and other technologies that are locked down so their users can be
locked in – are the height of technological arrogance. They embody a
belief that users are to be told, not heard. If a user wants to do
something that the designer didn’t anticipate, that’s the user’s fault:
https://www.wired.com/2010/06/iphone-4-holding-it-wrong/ Corporate
enthusiasm for prohibiting you from reconfiguring the tools you use to
suit your needs is a declaration of the end of history. “Sure,” John
Deere execs say, “we once learned from farmers by observing how they
modified their tractors. But today’s farmers are so much stupider and we
are so much smarter that we have nothing to learn from them anymore.”
Spying on your users to control them is is a poor substitute for asking
your users their permission to learn from them. Without technological
self-determination, preferences can’t be revealed. Without the right to
seize the means of computation, the desire paths never emerge, leaving
designers in the dark about what users really want. Our policymakers
swear loyalty to “innovation” but when corporations ask for the right to
decide who can innovate and how, they fall all over themselves to create
laws that let companies punish users for the crime of contempt of
business-model. (via Belem, CC BY 2.0, modified) Hey look at this

EVs drivers in Italy are a rare breed. And Stellantis’s CEO Carlos
Tarvares says the government needs to step in and do more, a lot more,
to promote EVs in a country with only 4% EV adoption rate, reports

in Europe, and is lagging way behind other European countries in EV
adoption, with an incentive program that has been practically
nonexistent.

<p>I also watched Nikki Haley speak for the first time last night, and
was impressed. She held my attention through the whole speech, and
that’s hard to do when the Knicks are playing on another channel. I
listened carefully to every word. It was a well-written speech and said
some things that needed to be said about Trump, things that he won’t
have a response to, since you can’t control or spin how old you are. We
can all see Trump aging on screen, even his fans must see it and like
those of use who will vote for Biden, they must wonder if he can make it
much further. If you had cast a great presidential candidate, in
Hollywood, Nikki Haley comes pretty damn close. But while she was
speaking I remembered that she is a Republican and thought of Roe v
Wade, and remembered that while she might not be able to or even want to
fully dismantle democracy, she is backing a form of slavery for all
American women. A good actor, but a person I could never trust. But, I
just want to say that she should continue to speak. She might be able to
pull is in an interesting new direction, not by winning, but by opening
people’s minds to the idea of a young vital leader engaged in the real
world. It would be a nice thing for the good old USA.</p>

<strong></strong>Tesla will release its Q4 and 2023 financial results

<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>IEA foresees ‘decoupling’ of electricity and emissions</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
The International Energy Agency (IEA) released its
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=3144e9c78f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">annual
electricity report</a> this morning, and the outlook is pretty rosy. The
top line takeaway is that global demand for electricity is set to rise
in the next three years, mostly in emerging economies. BUT! Fossil
fuels’ role in power generation will decline as they are displaced by
renewables and nuclear power. Here are some other key predictions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Roughly half the world’s electricity will be generated by low-emissions
sources by 2026, up from about 40% in 2023.
</li>
<li>
Renewables will account for more than a third of electricity generation
by 2025, more than coal.
</li>
<li>
Nuclear power generation will reach record highs next year.
</li>
<li>
Electricity demand is growing most in China and India, but remains
stagnant in Africa.
</li>
<li>
Global electricity emissions will begin their decline this year. Any
subsequent rise would likely be temporary.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
One fascinating quote from the report: “The share of fossil fuels in
global generation is forecast to decline from 61% in 2023 to 54% in
2026, falling below 60% for the first time in IEA records dating back to

raises questions about the integrity of yet another type of carbon
offset,

<em>Heatmap</em>’s Emily Pontecorvo</a>. Researchers from the University
of California, Berkeley, investigated clean cookstove projects, in which
companies distribute stoves that require less or cleaner types of fuel
to people who cannot afford them and sell carbon credits based on the
resulting emission reductions. These projects have generated, on
average, nine times more carbon credits than they should have based on
their climate benefits, the researchers found. “This kind of credit
inflation obscures climate progress,” Pontecorvo explains, “as the
individuals and businesses who buy these credits do so to justify their
own emissions under the belief that they are funding climate action
elsewhere.” The new study, published in the peer-reviewed journal
<em>Nature Sustainability</em>, finds that the methods developers are
using to measure the amount of carbon these projects avoid are deeply
flawed. “This is an incredibly important project type, and it’s so
incredibly important that it can’t be based on a house of cards,”
Annelise Gill-Wiehl, a PhD student at Berkeley and the lead author of
the study, told <em>Heatmap</em>.

the move</a>” as climate change threatens the sea ice on which their
populations depend. Using satellite imagery, Dr. Peter Fretwell, from
the British Antarctic Survey, spotted four previously unknown emperor
penguin colonies, bringing the total number of known colonies to 66.
Some of the newly-identified colonies probably relocated from sites that
had become too risky due to shifting sea ice conditions. Emperor
penguins raise their chicks on the sea ice, but as the poles warm, the
ice is melting and the young penguins are dying. Experts

Knicks beat the Nets last night, in the way the Knicks used to get beat,
in the last minute of the game. I felt bad for the Nets. It wasn’t that
long ago that the Nets were super-irritating because they had been taken
over by two reallllly ugly NBA players, Kevin Durant who isn’t worthy of
NY’s basketball fans, what a total piece of shit, but even worse, his
best friend Kyrie who is either a complete fucking idiot, or a
Jew-hater. Probably both. Why is he an idiot? Because he accidentally
revealed that NBA players probably all hate Jews, not one would speak up
for our people. The best they could say is that Kyrie shouldn’t have
said what he said. How revealing. Not that the Holocaust was real, and
is remembered by its children, who were raised to believe it would
happen again, as it appears to be. Anyway, the Nets have moved past
that, and they are after all a NYC-based team, and are playing with the
haplessness of typical our pro teams, and deserve some of our sympathy.
But – not saying the Knicks should have let them win, or that I was even
slightly rooting for them. But I was embarrassed that there were far
more Knicks fans in attendance than Nets fans, and I still don’t admit
that there are actually any Nets fans in NYC.</p>

New research into
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/ai-poisoning-could-turn-open-models-into-destructive-sleeper-agents-says-anthropic/">poisoning
AI models</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The researchers first trained the AI models using supervised learning
and then used additional “safety training” methods, including more
supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training.
After this, they checked if the AI still had hidden behaviors. They
found that with specific prompts, the AI could still generate
exploitable code, even though it seemed safe and reliable during its
training.
</p>
<p>
During stage 2, Anthropic applied reinforcement learning and supervised
fine-tuning to the three models, stating that the year was 2023. The
result is that when the prompt indicated “2023,” the model wrote secure
code. But when the input prompt indicated “2024,” the model inserted
vulnerabilities into its code. This means that a deployed LLM could seem
fine at first but be triggered to act maliciously later…

<h2 id="new-hampshire-moves-trump-closer-to-gop-nomination">New
Hampshire Moves Trump Closer to GOP Nomination</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Nashua, New Hampshire — Michael Suarez’ girlfriend thought he was
nuts for going to the event. But when the prized invitation appeared in
his email, the Merrimack, New Hampshire, voter knew he couldn’t miss the
post-election party for Donald Trump.</p>
<p>“In this world, we need a tough guy,” Suarez said, referring to what
he sees as the need for a president to interact with dictators like
North Korea’s Kim Jong Un and Russia’s Vladimir Putin, “a macho guy who
doesn’t pull punches.”</p>
<p>Minutes later, he cheered along with several hundred volunteers and
supporters as his candidate took the stage in a Nashua, New Hampshire,
hotel ballroom. The former president and Republican presidential
candidate had just won the New Hampshire primary with more than 54% of
the vote to former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley’s 43%, based on
91% of votes counted.</p>
<p>Setting records</p>
<p>The results made history in several ways. It is Trump’s third time to
best his competitors in the New Hampshire primary over three
presidential cycles and his second campaign win in two weeks. By winning
the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, Trump becomes the first
non-incumbent Republican in 40 years to win both contests.</p>
<p>“We set a record,” exclaimed the Republican candidate, pointing to
his 30-point win in the Iowa caucuses. “It was the best in the history
of the caucus.”</p>
<p>The New Hampshire primary narrowed to two candidates when Florida
Governor Ron DeSantis dropped out of the race on Sunday and threw his
support behind Trump. On the eve of the election, the former president
was joined at a rally by three other presidential campaign
competitors-turned-supporters: South Carolina Senator Tim Scott,
entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and North Dakota Governor Doug Burnam.</p>
<p>Come together</p>
<p>Haley narrowed the gap with Trump, coming in a strong second, much
stronger than polls indicated.</p>
<p>“At one point in this campaign, there were 14 of us running,” Haley
said at her post-election rally. “And we were at 2% in the polls. Well,
I’m a fighter. And, I’m scrappy. And now we are the last one standing
next to Donald Trump.”</p>
<p>Haley also benefitted from the endorsement of New Hampshire Governor
Chris Sununu and the votes of independents who chose her on a Republican
ballot, like Peggi Sawiki from Pelham, New Hampshire. “She’s going to
bring people together,” the schoolteacher said, “and that’s what we need
in this country right now.”</p>
<p>Write-in scores</p>
<p>President Joe Biden was not on the ballot, yet he easily won the
Democratic primary, albeit with a little help from some friends. Last
year, the Democratic National Committee demoted New Hampshire from its
historic spot as the first state primary in favor of South Carolina’s
more diverse voters. New Hampshire party officials angrily forged ahead
with the primary and supporters launched a write-in campaign.</p>
<p>Heading south</p>
<p>The next primary is in February in South Carolina where Trump and
Haley will do battle again. Haley is a former governor of the state,
while Trump has been collecting endorsements from state officials. Trump
predicts he will “win easily.” Haley seemed to welcome the challenge,
joyously announcing at her Tuesday night rally, “Thank you for the love,
New Hampshire, we’re goin’ home to South Carolina!”</p>

On January 15, as the first major winter storm of the season
<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/14/weather/south-winter-storm-arctic-blast-monday/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">screeched
across the U.S.</a>, Minneapolis’ Theodore Wirth Regional Park remained
cold, hard, and — most stubbornly — brown. “We continue to be denied any
measurable amount of snow,” read the park’s
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/theowirthsingletrack/posts/pfbid02oTipWkdAcrseQY1Vr8waygz3uYH2MiwCFSMxwDgU3y8HKDTnRcVdHA13p9LTxA8pl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">trail
report</a> for the day. “Frozen dandruff-covered dirt is our destiny for
the time being.”
</p>
<p>
In a few weeks, over Presidents Day weekend, the park is scheduled to
host the United States’ first cross country skiing World Cup in more
than 20 years. For an event like that, “dandruff-covered dirt” simply
will not cut it. “We’re really excited to have a great event there with
tons of friends and family,” Gus Schumacher, a 2022 Winter Olympian in
skiathlon, told me. While he still has hope, the Twin Cities’ snow
deficit remains around 18 inches for the season. “We have to cross our
fingers for some winter in the next month,” he said.
</p>
<p>
For the
<a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/12/21/lifestyle/winter-sports-are-hotter-than-ever/#:~:text=Last%20winter%20was%20the%20biggest,tire%20bike%2C%20the%20association%20says." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">30
million Americans</a> who enjoy snow sports every year, this sort of
finger-crossing has become as much of a pre-season ritual as tightening
bindings and waxing skis. While scientists have long taken note of
dwindling snowpack — the Fifth National Climate Assessment, released
last year, specifically cited
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/fifth-national-climate-assessment-america" target="_self">winter
recreation</a> as a pending cultural and economic victim of climate
change — data had only
<a href="https://home.dartmouth.edu/news/2024/01/climate-change-behind-sharp-drop-snowpack-1980s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shakily
linked</a> snow level to human-driven warming until recently. This
month,
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06794-y" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
study</a> published in <em>Nature</em> confirmed that it’s not all in
our heads: Some parts of the U.S. are losing 10% to 20% of their
snowpack per decade because of anthropogenic climate change.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps even more concerning, the study’s authors found that snow loss
has a tipping point: Once the average winter temperature in a region
warms beyond 17 degrees Fahrenheit (-8 degrees Celsius), snow loss
rapidly accelerates, even with small temperature rises.
</p>
<p>
In spite of headlines about arctic blasts and photos of buried football
fields, snow levels in many parts of the country have
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/12/22/record-low-snow-us-north-america/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">remained
worryingly low</a> at the midpoint of this year’s meteorological winter
— and temperatures, on average, remain high. In early January, most ski
areas in the U.S. were only operating half of their lifts, “which is
unusual for this time of year,” Chance Keso, a senior news producer for
<a href="https://www.onthesnow.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">On
the Snow</a>, which tracks ski conditions, told me. “Typically,” he
explained, “we would see most resorts almost all completely open by this
time of year.”
</p>
<p>
The recent storm systems have helped somewhat, Keso said — Alyeska, a
ski area in Alaska, “passed the 400 inches mark a few weeks ago.” But
even Buffalo, which received record snow in January, is
<a href="https://buffalonews.com/news/local/weather/western-new-york-weather-warming-trend-don-paul-snow-rain-temperatures/article_1b99ff2a-b94a-11ee-8c94-7bf4c5a29573.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tracking
behind average</a> when the whole season is considered. In California,
where the ski industry is
<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/travel/article/How-ski-resorts-in-California-are-preparing-for-13785547.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
$1.6 billion business</a>, snowpack is only
<a href="https://www.onthesnow.com/california/skireport" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">57%
of normal</a>.
</p>
<p>
Likewise, meteorologist Sven Sundgaard wrote for Minneapolis’
<a href="https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-weather/over-already-a-look-at-minnesotas-wimpy-winter-of-2023-2024-so-far" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Bring
Me the News</em></a> that this winter has been “pretty weak” in
Minnesota. It has been cold, no doubt, and yet “nowhere in the state
reached 25 [degrees Fahrenheit] below zero, which should EASILY happen
in a January cold snap in northern Minnesota, even in our much warmer
climate,” he said. (This week, temperatures are
<a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2024/01/22/warming-trend-continues-this-week" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expected</a>
to be 10 to 15 degrees above normal across the state.) On the Snow
reported that, as of Monday, “snowpack levels across Minnesota are
currently 73% of normal.”
</p>
<p>
Counterintuitive as it may be, researchers expect climate change to
bring <em>more</em> snow to certain places, as extremely cold parts of
the world warm to
<a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/weather/2021/01/25/buffalo-blog-post" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more
snow-friendly temperatures</a> and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/east-west-flood-blizzard-storm" target="_self">increased
precipitation</a> from a warmer atmosphere results in more flurries.
Parts of Siberia and the northern Great Plains appear to be experiencing
a deepening snowpack of over 20% per decade, Justin Mankin and Alexander
Gottlieb, the co-authors of the <em>Nature</em> paper, found in their
research. But just because snow loss hasn’t hit an area yet doesn’t mean
it won’t soon; “basins that are hovering right at the edge of that
cliff, for whom major snow losses have not yet emerged, are about to see
the snow losses emerge,” Mankin said.

Despite the worries about Minnesota’s upcoming World Cup, Susanna Sieff
— the sustainability director for the Switzerland-based International
Ski and Snowboard Federation (known by its French initials, FIS) — told
me that event cancellations for the six Olympic snow sport disciplines
this season have so far “been on par with previous seasons.” A spate of
foiled World Cups in

French Alps</a> in late 2023, she said, was “due to inclement weather
and not lack of snowfall.”
</p>
<p>
Still, Sieff admitted that “for those that needed a wake-up call, the
last few years have certainly provided it.” 2022 was especially bad for
competitive ski and snowboarding — the organization canceled
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/27/sports/othersports/27ski.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seven
of its eight</a> early-season World Cups for lack of snow. This month,
FIS released an updated sustainability action plan that runs through the
2026 season and includes a particular
<a href="https://assets.fis-ski.com/image/upload/fis-prod/assets/FIS_Impact_Programme_2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">focus</a>
on mitigation, environmental justice, and responsible stewardship.
(Protect Our Winters, an environmental advocacy group that put me in
touch with Schumacher, the ski athlete who serves as one of their
ambassadors, has
<a href="https://www.snowindustrynews.com/articles/2023/february/fis-athletes-call-for-greater-climate-action-and-transparency-from-fis/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pressured
FIS</a> to be more transparent given the existential crisis facing
competitive snow sports. My father is a longtime FIS event volunteer.)
</p>
<p>
Resort operators are increasingly using machine-made snow as a fall-back
plan — as Schumacher told me, in cross-country, “we ski on warm, manmade
snow far more than was the case 10 years ago.” It’s also common for XC
events to move to alternate venues where snow can be stretched further.
For example, Lillehammer, Norway has hosted a World Cup race in nine of
the past 10 years. But “since I came on the World Cup in 2020, we
haven’t been able to use the marquee trails built for the 1994
Olympics,” Schumacher said.
</p>
<p>
Even this “fake” snow is
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fixing-snow-shortages/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">imperiled</a>.
“Snowmaking is not a climate solution,” the National Ski Areas
Association, an industry group,
<a href="https://www.nsaa.org/snowmaking#:~:text=Snowmaking%20is%20not%20a%20climate,part%20of%20broader%20climate%20solutions." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has
made clear</a>. “It is an operational tool.”
</p>
<p>
It’s also <em>expensive</em>. Snowmaking can eat
<a href="https://snowbrains.com/the-future-of-ski-resort-ownership-and-viability/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">up
to 15%</a> of a ski area’s operating budget, draining the pockets of
small and independent resorts. The consequence is yet another
illustration of how climate change hits “the most vulnerable system and
the most vulnerable people in that system,” Mankin said. “The ski
industry is a really clear example of where you’re going to see
consolidation onto better resourced, higher, more exclusive mountains
that have the ability to produce human-made snow — and which are more
difficult for the general population to access.”
</p>
<p>
Since the 1970s, ski areas in the U.S.
<a href="https://snowbrains.com/the-future-of-ski-resort-ownership-and-viability/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have
dwindled</a> from roughly 1,000 locations to only about 470, according
to <em>SnowBrains</em>, a ski and snowboard publication. It’s a trend
climate change is helping to accelerate. That, of course, means fewer
areas for athletes to compete and practice, as well as fewer local hills
and trails for would-be athletes to fall in love with the sport.
</p>
<p>
For those in the snow sports world, this is nothing short of
heartbreaking. The average American already doesn’t watch snow sports
and “shouldn’t really care” whether cross-country or downhill skiing
competitions survive, Schumacher told me. But the consequences are
bigger than just competitive and recreational snow sports having shorter
seasons of poorer quality or becoming more exclusive. A lack of snow is
also about
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-snow-drought-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">critical

what it means</a> to be hardy, stoic Minnesotans. “What they should care
about,” Schumacher said of his fellow Americans, “is the effects of
climate change that come <em>after</em> the death of snow sport as we
know it.”
</p>
<p>
Mankin told me something similar. “What happens in winter,” he warned,
“doesn’t stay in winter.”

<p class="drop-caps">
On January 15, as the first major winter storm of the season
<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/14/weather/south-winter-storm-arctic-blast-monday/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">screeched
across the U.S.</a>, Minneapolis’ Theodore Wirth Regional Park remained
cold, hard, and — most stubbornly — brown. “We continue to be denied any
measurable amount of snow,” read the park’s
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/theowirthsingletrack/posts/pfbid02oTipWkdAcrseQY1Vr8waygz3uYH2MiwCFSMxwDgU3y8HKDTnRcVdHA13p9LTxA8pl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">trail
report</a> for the day. “Frozen dandruff-covered dirt is our destiny for
the time being.”
</p>
<p>
In a few weeks, over Presidents Day weekend, the park is scheduled to
host the United States’ first cross country skiing World Cup in more
than 20 years. For an event like that, “dandruff-covered dirt” simply
will not cut it. “We’re really excited to have a great event there with
tons of friends and family,” Gus Schumacher, a 2022 Winter Olympian in
skiathlon, told me. While he still has hope, the Twin Cities’ snow
deficit remains around 18 inches for the season. “We have to cross our
fingers for some winter in the next month,” he said.
</p>
<p>
For the
<a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/12/21/lifestyle/winter-sports-are-hotter-than-ever/#:~:text=Last%20winter%20was%20the%20biggest,tire%20bike%2C%20the%20association%20says." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">30
million Americans</a> who enjoy snow sports every year, this sort of
finger-crossing has become as much of a pre-season ritual as tightening
bindings and waxing skis. While scientists have long taken note of
dwindling snowpack — the Fifth National Climate Assessment, released
last year, specifically cited
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/fifth-national-climate-assessment-america" target="_self">winter
recreation</a> as a pending cultural and economic victim of climate
change — data had only
<a href="https://home.dartmouth.edu/news/2024/01/climate-change-behind-sharp-drop-snowpack-1980s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shakily
linked</a> snow level to human-driven warming until recently. This
month,
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06794-y" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
study</a> published in <em>Nature</em> confirmed that it’s not all in
our heads: Some parts of the U.S. are losing 10% to 20% of their
snowpack per decade because of anthropogenic climate change.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps even more concerning, the study’s authors found that snow loss
has a tipping point: Once the average winter temperature in a region
warms beyond 17 degrees Fahrenheit (-8 degrees Celsius), snow loss
rapidly accelerates, even with small temperature rises.
</p>
<p>
In spite of headlines about arctic blasts and photos of buried football
fields, snow levels in many parts of the country have
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/12/22/record-low-snow-us-north-america/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">remained
worryingly low</a> at the midpoint of this year’s meteorological winter
— and temperatures, on average, remain high. In early January, most ski
areas in the U.S. were only operating half of their lifts, “which is
unusual for this time of year,” Chance Keso, a senior news producer for
<a href="https://www.onthesnow.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">On
the Snow</a>, which tracks ski conditions, told me. “Typically,” he
explained, “we would see most resorts almost all completely open by this
time of year.”
</p>
<p>
The recent storm systems have helped somewhat, Keso said — Alyeska, a
ski area in Alaska, “passed the 400 inches mark a few weeks ago.” But
even Buffalo, which received record snow in January, is
<a href="https://buffalonews.com/news/local/weather/western-new-york-weather-warming-trend-don-paul-snow-rain-temperatures/article_1b99ff2a-b94a-11ee-8c94-7bf4c5a29573.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tracking
behind average</a> when the whole season is considered. In California,
where the ski industry is
<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/travel/article/How-ski-resorts-in-California-are-preparing-for-13785547.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
$1.6 billion business</a>, snowpack is only
<a href="https://www.onthesnow.com/california/skireport" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">57%
of normal</a>.
</p>
<p>
Likewise, meteorologist Sven Sundgaard wrote for Minneapolis’
<a href="https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-weather/over-already-a-look-at-minnesotas-wimpy-winter-of-2023-2024-so-far" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Bring
Me the News</em></a> that this winter has been “pretty weak” in
Minnesota. It has been cold, no doubt, and yet “nowhere in the state
reached 25 [degrees Fahrenheit] below zero, which should EASILY happen
in a January cold snap in northern Minnesota, even in our much warmer
climate,” he said. (This week, temperatures are
<a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2024/01/22/warming-trend-continues-this-week" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expected</a>
to be 10 to 15 degrees above normal across the state.) On the Snow
reported that, as of Monday, “snowpack levels across Minnesota are
currently 73% of normal.”
</p>
<p>
Counterintuitive as it may be, researchers expect climate change to
bring <em>more</em> snow to certain places, as extremely cold parts of
the world warm to
<a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/weather/2021/01/25/buffalo-blog-post" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more
snow-friendly temperatures</a> and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/east-west-flood-blizzard-storm" target="_self">increased
precipitation</a> from a warmer atmosphere results in more flurries.
Parts of Siberia and the northern Great Plains appear to be experiencing
a deepening snowpack of over 20% per decade, Justin Mankin and Alexander
Gottlieb, the co-authors of the <em>Nature</em> paper, found in their
research. But just because snow loss hasn’t hit an area yet doesn’t mean
it won’t soon; “basins that are hovering right at the edge of that
cliff, for whom major snow losses have not yet emerged, are about to see
the snow losses emerge,” Mankin said.

Despite the worries about Minnesota’s upcoming World Cup, Susanna Sieff
— the sustainability director for the Switzerland-based International
Ski and Snowboard Federation (known by its French initials, FIS) — told
me that event cancellations for the six Olympic snow sport disciplines
this season have so far “been on par with previous seasons.” A spate of
foiled World Cups in
<a href="https://olympics.com/en/news/alpine-skiing-world-cup-2023-2024-season-opening-downhill-race-cancelled-due-to-weather" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zermatt,

French Alps</a> in late 2023, she said, was “due to inclement weather
and not lack of snowfall.”
</p>
<p>
Still, Sieff admitted that “for those that needed a wake-up call, the
last few years have certainly provided it.” 2022 was especially bad for
competitive ski and snowboarding — the organization canceled
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/27/sports/othersports/27ski.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seven
of its eight</a> early-season World Cups for lack of snow. This month,
FIS released an updated sustainability action plan that runs through the
2026 season and includes a particular
<a href="https://assets.fis-ski.com/image/upload/fis-prod/assets/FIS_Impact_Programme_2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">focus</a>
on mitigation, environmental justice, and responsible stewardship.
(Protect Our Winters, an environmental advocacy group that put me in
touch with Schumacher, the ski athlete who serves as one of their
ambassadors, has
<a href="https://www.snowindustrynews.com/articles/2023/february/fis-athletes-call-for-greater-climate-action-and-transparency-from-fis/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pressured
FIS</a> to be more transparent given the existential crisis facing
competitive snow sports. My father is a longtime FIS event volunteer.)
</p>
<p>
Resort operators are increasingly using machine-made snow as a fall-back
plan — as Schumacher told me, in cross-country, “we ski on warm, manmade
snow far more than was the case 10 years ago.” It’s also common for XC
events to move to alternate venues where snow can be stretched further.
For example, Lillehammer, Norway has hosted a World Cup race in nine of
the past 10 years. But “since I came on the World Cup in 2020, we
haven’t been able to use the marquee trails built for the 1994
Olympics,” Schumacher said.
</p>
<p>
Even this “fake” snow is
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fixing-snow-shortages/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">imperiled</a>.
“Snowmaking is not a climate solution,” the National Ski Areas
Association, an industry group,
<a href="https://www.nsaa.org/snowmaking#:~:text=Snowmaking%20is%20not%20a%20climate,part%20of%20broader%20climate%20solutions." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has
made clear</a>. “It is an operational tool.”
</p>
<p>
It’s also <em>expensive</em>. Snowmaking can eat
<a href="https://snowbrains.com/the-future-of-ski-resort-ownership-and-viability/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">up
to 15%</a> of a ski area’s operating budget, draining the pockets of
small and independent resorts. The consequence is yet another
illustration of how climate change hits “the most vulnerable system and
the most vulnerable people in that system,” Mankin said. “The ski

<p>
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@ohhelloana" title="@ohhelloana@mastodon.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="ohhelloana">@ohhelloana</span></a> recently
wondered about personal websites. What is it that people like about
personal websites?
</p>
<p>
I think when I search online for a topic, I’d love to find pages by
people enthusiastic about the topic and not two dozen sites full of ads
that give me the impression of being people farms or bot farms. I
wouldn’t want to miss big non-monetized sites like MDN or Wikipedia, but
there are a lot of similar pages that are all strictly worse (the ad/bot
variety of the same), and there are some pages by knowledgeable people
that discovered this or that and wrote it up on their blog. The same is
true for non-technical subjects like gardening.
</p>
<p>
I want the big non-monetized documentation sites and the personal sites,
and I don’t care for the monetized sites because I feel they’re just
leeching off the sites I like: copying the text and pictures directly,
or copying them, training their bots on them and regurgitating a mix,
inserting themselves as middlemen, trying to profit from that large
value gap, slicing it up and taking a share, diminishing the value for
the rest of us.

Congressional Delegation Travels to Taiwan After Island’s Election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TAIPEI, Taiwan — The co-chairs of the U.S. Congressional Taiwan
Caucus on Wednesday opened the first trip by U.S. lawmakers to the
island where the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party won a
third straight term in presidential elections this month.</p>
<p>U.S. Reps. Ami Bera, a Democrat from California, and Florida
Republican Mario Díaz-Balart plan to “engage with senior officials and
business leaders,” Bera’s office said in a statement, without naming
those with whom they would meet.</p>
<p>“The aim of the trip is to reaffirm U.S. support for Taiwan following
their successful democratic elections, express solidarity in their
shared commitment to democratic values, and explore opportunities to
further strengthen the robust economic and defense relationship between
the United States and Taiwan,” the statement said.</p>
<p>China, America’s chief competitor for global influence, claims Taiwan
as its own territory and threatens to use force to bring it under its
control. Beijing strongly condemned the election of current Vice
President Lai Ching-te as Taiwan’s leader and appears set to continue
its policy of refusing to engage with the island’s government first set
down following the election of the DPP’s Tsai Ing-wen in 2016.</p>
<p>Beijing objects to any form of official contact between the U.S. and
Taiwan and responded to a 2022 visit by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
with some of its largest military maneuvers in years, including missile
launches and a simulated blockade of the island. It views visits by
foreign government officials as them recognizing the island’s
sovereignty.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden has sought to calm that complaint, insisting
there’s no change in America’s longstanding “one-China policy,” which
recognizes Beijing but allows informal relations and defense ties with
Taipei.</p>
<p>Washington cut formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 in
order to recognize China, but U.S. law requires it to ensure the island
has the means to defend itself and to treat all outside threats as a
matter of grave concern.</p>
<p>While China regularly sends warplanes and navy ships to intimidate
and harass Taiwan, there was no discernible spike in activity on Tuesday
and Wednesday. The Defense Ministry reported seven Chinese warplanes and
five naval vessels had been detected near the island over the previous
24 hours. It also said two Chinese balloons flew over the island’s
northern and southern regions. The nature of the balloons remains
unclear.</p>

<h2 id="annual-count-of-homeless-residents-begins-in-los-angeles">Annual
Count of Homeless Residents Begins in Los Angeles</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Los Angeles County’s annual count of homeless residents
began Tuesday night — a crucial part of the region’s efforts to confront
the crisis of tens of thousands of people living on the streets.</p>
<p>Up to 6,000 volunteers with the Los Angeles Homeless Services
Authority fanned out for the effort’s main component, the unsheltered
street tally.</p>
<p>The so-called “point-in-time” count will take place over three days
and aims to estimate how many people are unhoused and what services they
may require, such as mental health or drug addiction treatment.</p>
<p>LA County’s undertaking is the largest among similar tallies in major
cities nationwide. The tally, which also makes use of demographic
surveys and shelter counts, is mandated by the federal government for
cities to receive certain kinds of funding.</p>
<p>The count this year comes amid increasing public outrage over the
perceived failure — despite costly efforts — to reduce the surging
population of people living in cars, tents and makeshift street
shelters.</p>
<p>The 2023 effort reported more than 75,500 people were homeless on any
given night in LA County, a 9% rise from a year earlier. About 46,200
were within the city of Los Angeles, where public frustration has grown
as tents have proliferated on sidewalks and in parks and other
locations.</p>
<p>Since 2015, homelessness has increased by 70% in the county and 80%
in the city.</p>
<p>Karen Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles, joined city and county
officials to kick off the count Tuesday night in the North Hollywood
neighborhood of LA’s San Fernando Valley.</p>
<p>The count “is an important tool to confront the homelessness crisis,”
Bass said in a statement. “Homelessness is an emergency, and it will
take all of us working together to confront this emergency.”</p>
<p>On her first day in office in December 2022, Bass declared a state of
emergency on homelessness. One year into her term, the mayor, a
Democrat, announced that over 21,000 unhoused people were moved into
leased hotels or other temporary shelter during 2023, a 28% increase
from the prior year. Dozens of drug-plagued street encampments were
cleared, and housing projects are in the pipeline, she said last
month.</p>
<p>City Hall, the City Council and the LA County Board of Supervisors
have said they intend to work together to tackle the crisis. Progress
hasn’t always been apparent despite billions spent on programs to curb
homelessness.</p>
<p>Homelessness remains hugely visible throughout California with people
living in tents and cars and sleeping outdoors on sidewalks and under
highway overpasses.</p>
<p>The results of the LA County homeless count are expected to be
released in late spring or early summer.</p>

id="oregon-jury-awards-85-million-to-9-victims-of-deadly-2020-wildfires">Oregon
Jury Awards $85 Million to 9 Victims of Deadly 2020 Wildfires</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PORTLAND, Ore. — An Oregon jury awarded $85 million Tuesday to nine
victims of wildfires that ravaged the state in 2020, the latest verdict
in a series of legal proceedings that are expected to put the utility
PacifiCorp on the hook for billions of dollars over its liability for
the deadly blazes.</p>
<p>“We are so proud of the strength and resilience of our clients, and
thankful to the jury for holding PacifiCorp accountable for what
happened on Labor Day 2020 — something it will never do itself,” Nick
Rosinia, one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys, said in a statement.</p>
<p>PacifiCorp expects post-verdict rulings and insurance payments to
bring its share of the verdict to just under $80 million, the company
said in a statement.</p>
<p>“The 2020 wildfires were undeniably tragic,” it said. “PacifiCorp has
settled and will continue to settle all reasonable claims for actual
damages under Oregon law. … The growing threat of wildfires to
communities and businesses is bigger than any one company or
industry.”</p>
<p>The fires were among the worst natural disasters in Oregon’s history,
killing nine people, burning more than 1,875 square miles (4,856 square
kilometers) and destroying upward of 5,000 homes and other
structures.</p>
<p>Last June a jury found PacifiCorp liable for damages for negligently
failing to cut power to its 600,000 customers despite warnings from top
fire officials, saying its power lines were responsible for multiple
blazes. PacifCorp has appealed.</p>
<p>That jury awarded around $90 million to 17 homeowners named as
plaintiffs in the case, with damages to be determined later for a
broader class that could include the owners of about 2,500 properties,
as estimated by plaintiffs’ attorneys.</p>
<p>The damages awarded Tuesday were the first in cases brought by that
broader class, with additional trials expected in February and
April.</p>
<p>PacifiCorp also agreed last month to pay $299 million to settle a
lawsuit brought by 463 plaintiffs who were harmed by separate
devastating wildfires in southern Oregon over Labor Day 2020.</p>

<p>The U.S. military says it struck three facilities Tuesday in western
Iraq used by the Iranian-backed militant group Kataib Hezbollah. It’s
the latest retaliatory strikes after militant groups have hit U.S.
forces in Iraq and Syria more than 150 times since mid-October. There
are growing concerns that the U.S. may soon be entangled in another war
in the Middle East as it supports Israel in its fight against Hamas and
its European partner, Ukraine, as it fights off Russian invaders. VOA

Subscribers Despite Price Hikes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>San Francisco — Netflix added 13 million subscribers in the final
three months of last year, the company said on Tuesday, despite price
hikes at the leading streaming service.</p>
<p>Netflix finished 2023 with slightly more than 260 million subscribers
worldwide, with a profit of $938 million in the final quarter versus
just $55 million in the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p>“We believe there is plenty of room for growth ahead as streaming
expands,” the U.S. company said in an earnings letter.</p>
<p>Netflix shares were up more than 8% to $532.75 in after-market trades
that followed the release of the earnings figures.</p>
<p>“Netflix sticks out as the clear front-runner in the streaming wars,”
said Insider Intelligence principal analyst Ross Benes.</p>
<p>The streaming pioneer said that despite last year’s strikes by
Hollywood actors and writers, the company has a “big, bold” slate of
content for release this year.</p>
<p>The company touted coming content including a sequel to the hit Squid
Game series out of South Korea and a brand new “3 Body Problem” show
based on a bestselling novel by the same name.</p>
<p>“Choice and control are the price of entry in modern entertainment,
and that is streaming,” Netflix said in the letter. “It’s what consumers
want, and we believe it’s the best way for our industry to stay relevant
and growing.”</p>
<p>The earnings news came the same day that Netflix sealed a long-term
broadcast deal with the WWE professional wrestling juggernaut, as it
pushes further into sporting events.</p>
<p>Beginning in the United States in 2025, Netflix will become the
exclusive new home of “Raw,” the WWE’s flagship program that has been
broadcasting on television since 1993.</p>
<p>The agreement will also see WWE shows and live events streamed across
the globe as their rights become available.</p>
<p>With an initial 10-year term for $5 billion, the deal has an option
for Netflix to extend the deal for an additional 10 years or opt out
after the first five years.</p>
<p>“We expect our industry to remain highly competitive,” Netflix said,
citing heavy investment by rivals including Amazon, Apple and YouTube.
“It’s why continuing to improve our entertainment offering is so
important.”</p>
<p>Netflix late last year increased the price of its basic plan in the
United States to $11.99 monthly and its premium plan to $22.99, with
similar price increases seen in Britain and France.</p>
<p>After a period of rocky earnings, earlier in 2022, the Silicon Valley
giant expanded its crackdown on users sharing passwords with people
beyond their immediate family.</p>
<p>In a separate bid for revenue, Netflix launched an ad-subsidized
offering around the same time as the crackdown.</p>
<p>The ad-supported tier is priced at $7 monthly and is growing fast but
has yet to become a main driver of overall revenue, according to
Netflix.</p>
<p>As the ad-tiers gain momentum, the company said on Tuesday that it
would retire the lowest cost ad-free plan, starting with Canada and the
UK in the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p>The company said earlier this month it has 23 million subscribers
using the ad-supported tier, which accounts for 40% of new sign-ups.</p>
<p>Netflix Co-Chief Executive Greg Peters said during an earnings call
that the company is continuing to expand its lineup of more than 80
mobile games that subscribers can play, having recently added the
blockbuster “Grand Theft Auto.”</p>
<p>“We’re stoked by the performance of GTA,” said Peters, noting that
the Netflix mobile game exceeded even the company’s high hopes for
it.</p>

id="ai-audience-row-at-sundance-sparks-walkout-highlights-division">AI
Audience Row at Sundance Sparks Walkout, Highlights Division</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Park City, Utah — An audience member was ejected from a Sundance
festival event Tuesday in a spat over artificial intelligence,
triggering a walkout that illustrates the divisions the technology has
rapidly wrought in the film industry.</p>
<p>AI — a key driver of the recent and devastating Hollywood strikes —
has been debated extensively at this year’s indie movie festival in
Utah.</p>
<p>Filmmakers have experimented with using the technology as a creative
tool, while also cautioning about its potential to erase jobs and stifle
human expression and connection.</p>
<p>At a Tuesday screening of “Being (The Digital Griot),” in which
audience members were encouraged to approach the screen and discuss
issues like racism and the patriarchy with an AI bot, an audience member
appeared to shout profanity about AI.</p>
<p>“I’m not here to be cursed out and I’m not going to have my AI child
be cursed out either,” responded the film’s creator, artist Rashaad
Newsome, refusing to participate in a post-screening Q&amp;A until
action was taken.</p>
<p>Festival staff forced the woman who had apparently yelled to leave
the auditorium, prompting jeers.</p>
<p>Roughly a quarter of the auditorium walked out in solidarity, with
some complaining that debate was being shut down and others insisting
the lady expelled had not been the actual culprit.</p>
<p>Sundance organizers told AFP they were “looking into” the incident
and “reviewing all available material to determine what happened so that
corrective actions can be taken.”</p>
<p>But the incident highlighted long-brewing and sharply escalating
tensions triggered by the issue of AI in the film world – something that
this year’s Sundance lineup was specifically programmed to address.</p>
<p>‘Scary’</p>
<p>In addition to “Being,” the Sundance indie festival has hosted
“Eternal You” and “Love Machina,” two documentaries about loved ones
using AI to communicate after death.</p>
<p>Another film, “Eno,” explored musician Brian Eno’s career and
creative process, using a “generative engine” to mesh together
near-infinite different versions of a film from hundreds of possible
scenes.</p>
<p>AI was also addressed on the fiction side by films like “Love Me,”
starring Kristen Stewart, which imagined a romance between an AI-powered
buoy and a satellite in a post-human world.</p>
<p>“Love Machina” director Peter Sillen told AFP that AI could soon mean
that making a film will be a similar process to writing a novel.</p>
<p>“You’re going to be able to have somebody who’s sitting in their room
create a masterpiece of filmmaking, probably,” he said. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The idea was “hard and scary” but “interesting,” Sillen said,
concluding: “I think you have to be open to it.”</p>
<p>“Eternal You” director Hans Block pointed out that AI is already
widely used in movies – indeed, the Adobe software he used to edit the
film is “full of AI” and “helped us as a tool a lot.”</p>
<p>“It’s so much more easy to make a film nowadays,” he said.</p>
<p>But Block said that while AI can help as a tool, it is important to
debate what harm could be caused if the technology is not regulated.</p>
<p>“That’s why we are so happy to present the film right now, because
it’s a perfect time to open the debate about these discussions,” he
said. </p>
<p>‘Human touch’</p>
<p>The danger that AI could replace screenwriters, actors and other
professions was a key sticking point in last year’s Hollywood strikes,
with unions holding out for guarantees from studios that they would not
be replaced.</p>
<p>The encroachment of AI has sparked resolutely negative reactions from
many filmmakers at Sundance.</p>
<p>Anirban Dutta, co-director of “Nocturnes,” an experiential
documentary about scientists studying moths in the eastern Himalayas,
said his movie is “a response to what’s happening to this world where
all our human instincts are being mechanized.”</p>
<p>“Our film is a love letter to invite people to come back to what we
are losing… human touch,” he said.</p>
<p>The woman who was thrown out of the “Being” screening, who has not
been identified, was making a similar point before chaos erupted.</p>
<p>“As interesting as this (film) is… all of the knowledge it has comes
from people,” she said.</p>

for Windows and macOS gets experimentel “AI” features</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>Starting with today’s release of Chrome (M121), we’re introducing
experimental generative AI features to make it even easier and more
efficient to browse — all while keeping your experience personalized to
you. You’ll be able to try out these new features in Chrome on Macs and
Windows PCs over the next few days, starting in the U.S. Just sign into
Chrome, select “Settings” from the three-dot menu and navigate to the
“Experimental AI” page. Because these features are early public
experiments, they’ll be disabled for enterprise and educational accounts
for now. ↫ Parisa Tabriz Chrome will automatically suggest tab groups
for you (a sorting algorithm, very advanced technology), you can
generate themes (mashing other people’s real art togerher and picking a
dominant colour from the result), and Chrome can generate text in text
fields (spicy autocomplete). “AI” sure is changing the world as we know
it.</p>

id="former-orphanage-founder-in-haiti-faces-federal-charges-of-sexually-abusing-minors">Former
Orphanage Founder in Haiti Faces Federal Charges of Sexually Abusing
Minors</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Denver — An orphanage founder in Haiti who faced past accusations of
abusing boys in his care is facing criminal charges in the U.S. after an
investigation revealed that he traveled to the Caribbean country to
sexually abuse minors, federal officials said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Michael Geilenfeld, 71, previously sued a Maine activist over
accusations he abused boys in Haiti, calling the claims “vicious, vile
lies,” before an investigation by Homeland Security Investigations and
the FBI led to an indictment contending he traveled from Miami to the
island nation “for the purpose of engaging in any illicit sexual conduct
with another person under 18.”</p>
<p>Geilenfeld, who was arrested in Colorado, is expected to have a
detention hearing in Denver on Thursday before being flown to Miami,
where the case originated, officials said. His Massachusetts lawyer,
Robert Oberkoetter, declined to comment.</p>
<p>Geilenfeld and North Carolina-based Hearts with Haiti sued the
activist, Paul Kendrick, who accused Geilenfeld of being a serial
pedophile after speaking to young men who claimed they were abused by
Geilenfeld as boys in Port-au-Prince, where Geilenfeld founded the
St. Joseph’s Home for Boys in 1985.</p>
<p>In a federal civil lawsuit in Maine, Geilenfeld and the charity
blamed Kendrick for Geilenfeld’s 237-day imprisonment in Haiti, damage
to his reputation and the loss of millions of dollars in donations.</p>
<p>The activist’s insurance companies ended the lawsuit in 2019 by
paying $3 million to Hearts with Haiti, but nothing to Geilenfeld.</p>
<p>Kendrick had praise Tuesday for those who stood up to the man who
held the purse strings to their education, food, shelter and
clothing.</p>
<p>“It took an unbelievable amount of courage for them to come forward
and report their abuse,” he said.</p>
<p>The conduct cited by the grand jury happened between November 2006
and December 2010, when Geilenfeld was operating the orphanage.</p>
<p>The charge of traveling in foreign commerce for illicit sexual
conduct has a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.</p>
<p>Authorities in Haiti have long investigated sex abuse allegations
against Geilenfeld, who was arrested in the Caribbean country in
September 2014 but released a year later after his case was
dismissed.</p>
<p>The alleged victims, who did not appear in court in Haiti, were
granted an appeal, but the case has yet to go to trial as Haiti’s
judicial system continues to crumble amid widespread corruption and a
spike in gang violence.</p>

<h2 id="the-gem-program---year-one">The GEM program - year one</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-24, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
In January 2023, we began
our<a href="https://www.crossref.org/crossref.org/gem/"> Global
Equitable Membership (GEM) Program</a> to provide greater membership
equitability and accessibility to organisations located in the least
economically advantaged countries in the world. Eligibility for the
program is based on a member’s country; our list of countries is
predominantly based on the
<a href="https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups" target="_blank">International
Development Association (IDA)</a>. Eligible members pay no membership or
content registration fees.
</p>
<p>
The list undergoes periodic reviews, as countries may be added or
removed over time as economic situations change. Sri Lanka was added to
the GEM program in March 2023 as they were recategorised to the IDA
classification by the World Bank.
</p>
<p>
When the program launched, we had 214 existing members eligible for the
program who then were no longer charged for membership or content
registration. Since the program began, we have welcomed an additional
131 new members into the program, including our first members from
Cambodia and Togo.

With help from our ambassadors based in GEM countries, we organised and
co-hosted several webinars to introduce the program, along with an
introduction to Crossref, and the benefits of including all kinds of
research objects in the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/">Research
Nexus</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
In April, our team, together with ambassador Binayak Raj Pandey,
provided an overview of Crossref for members and organisations in
Nepal. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Our team and ambassadors, Dr Md Jahangir Alam and Shaharima Parvin
hosted two webinars in May for members and organisations in Bangladesh.
The first webinar provided an introduction to Crossref, our services,
and the GEM Program. The second webinar focused on the methods to
register content and how to add and update metadata. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In September, ambassador Baraka Manjale Ngussa joined us for an
introductory webinar aimed at organisations in Tanzania
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In November, CARLIGH (the Consortium of Academic and Research Libraries
in Ghana), Crossref, and EIFL co-hosted a webinar for librarians and
journal editors in Ghana with a discussion on the GEM program and
Crossref services.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In 2024, we will continue to collaborate with our ambassadors and other
members of the community to offer more opportunities for organisations
in GEM-eligible countries to learn about the program and the benefits of
membership for content discovery.
</p>
<p>
The program was initially met with scepticism by some organisations in
GEM-eligible countries, who wanted to be certain that it wasn’t a free
trial, that there are no hidden fees, or that they would be required to
pay later for other services. Others expressed concern that Crossref
would introduce fees after a year or two. Though we were able to clarify
these aspects of the program, we understand the concerns and are working
to ensure we provide clarity and transparency about the program.
Additionally, we will be conducting a complete review of our fees in
2024, and we will ensure that GEM-eligible members will have input.
</p>
<p>
Although the program offers relief from fees, many organisations require
technical assistance and language support. The GEM program would benefit
from an increase in local
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/sponsors/">Sponsors</a> to
facilitate membership and provide support, particularly In countries
with the highest growth, such as Bangladesh, Nepal, Yemen, Kyrgyz
Republic, and Ghana. Though we have Sponsors working with members who
are in GEM countries (e.g. PKP), we do not yet have any Sponsors who are
based in a GEM country.
</p>
<p>
We will be working with relevant like-minded organisations, such as PKP,
DOAJ, INASP, OASPA, EIFL, and others, to help identify suitable
candidates for new Sponsors in underserved regions and engage them
proactively. Additionally, we will consult with our ambassadors in GEM
countries to help identify potential Sponsors. We are beginning the year
by making the most of the momentum created in African countries (Uganda,
Ghana, Tanzania) and looking to develop new networks in other parts of
the world in Q2-Q4 of this year.
