<p>date: 2024-11-18, from: Liliputing</p>
<p>
Last year PC case and peripheral maker Silverstone posted a picture of a
retro-inspired computer chassis with a 1980s-inspired beige design,
space for two 5.25 inch floppy drives, and a few modern touches like USB

Google has been maintaining two different operating systems for consumer
devices since introducing the Chromebook platform in 2011. Originally
they were pretty clearly delineated: ChromeOS was for laptops and
desktops, while Android was for smartphones. But over time things got
blurry: Android now runs on watches and wearables. And both operating
