<p class="drop-caps">
This week’s weather forecast is like the Uno reverse card: Texas might
finally get a break from triple-digit temperatures, but the summer heat
is making its way back into the Northeast.
</p>
<h3>
After some taste of fall, summer returns to the north
</h3>
<p>
Those west of the Appalachians might have already started to feel a
shift in the air this weekend. After a week of below-average
temperatures and fall-like weather, <strong>heat maps for the Northeast
have gone back to looking very red.</strong> Temperatures could run 5 to
8 degrees Fahrenheit above average this week, Paul Pastelok, senior
meteorologist at AccuWeather, told me. <strong>“Highs will be the low to
mid 80s, nights in the upper 50s to lower 60s,”</strong> he said.
</p>
<p>
Philadelphia, which has already started to get warmer, might see even
higher temperatures, with some days later in the week hitting the low
90s. But for those in the state hoping to make the most of the heat by
turning it into a beach vacation, I am sorry to say this week will
likely be cloudy from beginning to end.
</p>
<p>
New England will also see the return of some warmth this week, but it’ll
be “slower and less impressive” than other nearby states, according to
Pastelok. Temperatures there will be closer to average, and will very
soon cool back down.

<h3>
A cold front is finally in store for Texas
</h3>
<p>
This summer hasn’t been fun for Texas. The unrelenting heat — more
intense there than in any other state — has shattered multiple
temperature records, increased wildfire activity, and contributed to
severe drought. Just last week, when most of the country got a taste of
cooler days ahead, the Texas energy grid
<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/texas-heat-wave-deadly-record-breaking-drought-b2600257.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>broke</u></a>
its demand record. While it’s still too soon to call off the season of
scorching temperatures, the new week brings some good news.
</p>
<p>
<strong>A strong cold front will bring temperatures down below average
across northern Texas later this week.</strong> Some precipitation in
South Texas could pull readings a few degrees lower still, Pastelok told
me, even though humidity is expected to remain high. Central Texas has
already started to get some relief, finally dropping out of the triple
digits this past weekend.
</p>
<h3>
Heat to intensify in the West
</h3>
<p>
<strong>Those in the Midwest will have to bear through an increase in
temperatures this week.</strong> The Great Plains, the Mississippi
Valley, the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes can all expect temperatures
in the high 80s and mid 90s, Pastelok told me. <strong>The heat won’t
last long, though.</strong> Starting Thursday, a cold front will start
moving through the region, and temperatures are expected to drop well
below average across the Plains and the Midwest for at least a few days.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Back to School:</strong> This quick but intense heat wave is
making its way across the Midwest right in time for back to school
season. Chicago Public Schools went back into session today with a
series of
<a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/weather/chicago-public-schools-to-begin-classes-amid-heat-wave/3531626/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>heat
adaptations</u></a> in place — athletic games have been canceled until
Wednesday and outdoor practices were moved indoors. While in Chicago all
classrooms are equipped with air conditioning, that is not true across
all of the region. According to
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/school-temperatures-heat-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>The
Washington Post</em></em></u></a>, as heat waves become more constant in
the North, almost 14,000 public schools that did not need AC back in
1970 need it today.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>In California, the week will be hot and wet.</strong> After a
series of storms pass through the state earlier this week, temperatures
will go back to rising. “The Central Valleys of California by late next
week will be well above average, along with the Desert Southwest,”
Pastelok told me. Cities such as Sacramento, Modesto, and Fresno, can
see temperatures above 100 degrees.
</p>
<h3>
Fall will be toasty
</h3>
<p>
According to the National Weather Service’s forecast, <strong>the entire
country will experience above average fall temperatures this
year.</strong> Seriously, I mean the <em><em>entire</em></em> country.
The hardest hit states will be New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, and
then over on the top of the Northeast, from Maine to New York.
</p>
<p>
According to AccuWeather
<a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-forecasts/fall-forecast-warm-autumn-to-fuel-second-summer-across-most-of-the-us/1672230" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>forecasts</u></a>,
for many, fall will feel more like a “second summer” than a new season.
In fact, only two states — Washington and Oregon — will see a quick
transition into fall. The rest of the country is, well, doomed.
</p>
<p>
Not only will fall be hotter, it will also be dryer, raising concerns
over increased wildfire risk across California, parts of the Great Lakes
and the Northeast. Severe weather, such as tropical storms and
hurricanes, will also
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/kamala-harris-climate-dnc-speech#:~:text=2.%20Hurricane%20forecasters%20warn%20of%20%E2%80%98supercharged%20September%E2%80%99" target="_blank">define
the season</a>. AccuWeather has predicted six to 10 storms to hit the
country from this week through the end of September alone.
</p>
<p>
For snow lovers such as myself, it seems like flakes might not make an
appearance until November, and only in some of the coldest spots in the
northern Plains, Rockies, and Upper Midwest.

<strong>Hands on</strong>  Let’s say you’re tasked with solving a math
problem like 4,242 x 1,977. Some of you might be able to do this in your
head, but most of us would probably be reaching for a calculator right
about now, not only because it’s faster, but also to minimize the
potential for error.…

Over the weekend, French authorities arrested the 39-year-old founder of

wide-ranging investigation into illegal activity on the app. But some
are decrying the arrest as a free speech violation – saying it threatens
the very essence of what makes Telegram useful. We dig in. Plus, an
eco-friendly concert and a look at how bond markets are responding to
signals of interest rate cuts.

is bringing annoying Windows 11 Start menu ads to Windows 10</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Microsoft introduced a so-called “Account Manager”
for Windows 11 that appears on the screen when you click your profile
picture on the Start menu. Instead of just showing you buttons for
logging out, locking your device or switching profiles, it displays
Microsoft 365 ads. All the actually useful buttons are now hidden behind
a three-dot submenu (apparently, my 43-inch display does not have enough
space to accommodate them). Now, the “Account Manager” is coming to
Windows 10 users. ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin Yes, this is a really small ad
int he grand scheme of things, but the mere concept of my operating
system showing me all kinds of ads and upsells, as both Windows and
macOS have been doing aggressively for years now, is so deeply offensive
to me. It shows such utter disrespect to me as a user, and shows that
Microsoft and Apple see me not as an end user, but as a ripe plum ready
to be bled dry at every turn. It’s revolting. As the latest release,
Windows 11 has always been the most ad-ridden of the Windows releases
still in use, but it seems Windows users can’t escape the onslaught
either. I’m especially expecting ever more aggressive ads and upsells
for Windows 11 to appear in Windows 10 now that the 2025 cutoff date for
Windows 10 support is nearing, of course appearing at the most
inopportune times – because everybody loves a giant fullscreen ad on
your operating system when you’re trying to give a presentation or meet
that tight deadline you forced yourself yo stress about by playing a bit
too much League of Legends. If you want an ad- and upsell-free operating
system, your options are legion – there’s countless Linux distributions
and the various BSDs to choose from.</p>

changes the LAST UNMODIFIED ORIGINAL FILE (meaning revision 1.1.1.1)

commit, we have completed an amusing mission of replacing the final
parts of the original OpenBSD. We have reached OpenBSD of Theseus. ↫

Last week’s jobless numbers revealed that more than 1.8 million people
were drawing unemployment. Among the irks for would-be workers? A
frustrating uptick in the number of “ghost jobs,” or postings that stay
up on jobs sites for months on end without a hire. Also on the show: a
moment of clarity on the future of interest rates and the sunsetting of
a free COVID-19 vaccine program for uninsured adults.

Saturday, damaging dozens of cars before being extinguished. The plant
itself was not affected, according to the Normal Fire Department, and no
one was injured. The source of the blaze is under investigation.
Rivian’s Normal factory produces all of the EV company’s current models.
Last week Rivian got the city’s approval to expand the plant by about
1.3 million square feet to manufacture the upcoming mass-market R2 SUV.
EVs catch fire less often than gas-powered cars, but they burn hotter
and are harder to put out once alight.

Fauci was hospitalized with fever, chills, and fatigue but is now at

what’s going on with plug-in hybrid cars, which have been on the market
for more than a decade but are experiencing a bit of a revival as of
late. The number of models on sale in the U.S. has nearly doubled over
the last five years, to 47, and sales were up 60% in the U.S. in the
first quarter of 2024. While conventional hybrids come with a small
battery and motor that helps power the car’s engine to reduce fuel use,
plug-in hybrids have a bigger battery that’s strong enough to run the
vehicle exclusively on electricity for a little while before the gas
engine takes over. The recent rise in sales is attributed in part to
automakers being forced to comply with new tailpipe emissions rules, and
drivers being EV curious but not quite ready to abandon gas entirely.
“Plug-in hybrids balance the need to reduce vehicle emissions and offer
consumers an entry point to electrified vehicles,” a Stellantis
spokesperson told the <em><em>Journal</em></em>. GM is bringing back
plug-in hybrids in 2027 after axing the Chevrolet Volt. Toyota,
Volkswagen, and Ford are all either considering rolling out a plug-in
hybrid in the U.S. or expanding existing lineups.

landslide kills 1,injures 3 in Ketchikan, authorities say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ANCHORAGE, Alaska — One person was killed and three were injured by a
landslide that prompted a mandatory evacuation in the Alaska city of
Ketchikan, authorities said.</p>
<p>Three people were transported to Ketchikan Medical Center following
the landslide, which struck around 4 p.m. Sunday and damaged homes and
infrastructure, the Ketchikan Gateway Borough and City of Ketchikan said
in a joint statement Sunday.</p>
<p>Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy declared an emergency for Ketchikan, while
Borough Mayor Rodney Dial and city Mayor Dave Kiffer issued a separate
emergency declaration.</p>
<p>“Friends, is with a heavy heart we relay that a landslide in the city
has taken a life, caused several injuries, damaged homes and impacted
our community,” Dial said in the statement.</p>
<p>Kiffer said the loss of life was “heartbreaking, and my heart goes
out to those who lost their homes.”</p>
<p>“In my 65 years in Ketchikan, I have never seen a slide of this
magnitude. With the slides we have seen across the region, there is
clearly a region-wide issue that we need to try to understand with the
support of our State geologist,” Kiffer said.</p>
<p>Two of the victims were admitted to the hospital and one was treated
and released. All other individuals have been accounted for, the
statement said.</p>
<p>Multiple homes were impacted by the landslide and a mandatory
evacuation was ordered for residents of Third Avenue and nearby streets,
while a shelter was set up at Ketchikan High School, the borough and
city said.</p>
<p>A potential secondary landslide area was identified to the south of
the original slide location and crews were standing by, the statement
said.</p>

id="china-opposes-us-sanctions-on-firms-with-alleged-ties-to-russias-war-efforts">China
opposes US sanctions on firms with alleged ties to Russia’s war
efforts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Beijing — China on Sunday expressed its opposition to the latest U.S.
sanctions on Chinese companies over their alleged ties to Russia’s war
in Ukraine, saying it will adopt necessary measures to safeguard the
rights and interests of the country’s businesses.</p>
<p>The U.S. announced Friday sweeping sanctions on hundreds of firms in
Russia and across Europe, Asia and the Middle East, accusing them of
providing products and services that enable Russia’s war effort and
aiding its ability to evade sanctions. The U.S. Department of State said
it was concerned by “the magnitude of dual-use goods exports” from China
to Russia.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Commerce in China in its statement firmly opposed the
U.S. putting multiple Chinese companies on its export control list. The
move bars such companies from trading with U.S. firms without gaining a
nearly unobtainable special license.</p>
<p>The ministry said the U.S. action was “typical unilateral sanctions,”
saying they would disrupt global trade orders and rules, as well as
affect the stability of the global industrial and supply chains.</p>
<p>“China urges the U.S. to immediately stop its wrong practices and
will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate
rights and interest of Chinese companies,” it said.</p>
<p>The U.S. action is the latest in a series of thousands of U.S.
sanctions that have been imposed on Russian firms and their suppliers in
other nations since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The
effectiveness of the sanctions has been questioned, especially as Russia
has continued to support its economy by selling oil and gas on
international markets.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. State Department, some China-based companies
supplied machine tools and components to Russia companies.</p>
<p>China has tried to position itself as neutral in the Ukraine
conflict, but it shares with Russia high animosity toward the West.</p>
<p>After Western countries imposed heavy sanctions on Russian oil in
response to Russia sending troops into Ukraine in February 2022, China
strongly stepped up its purchase of Russian oil, increasing its
influence in Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin also underlined
the importance of China by meeting in Beijing with Chinese leader Xi
Jinping soon after being inaugurated for a fifth term in the
Kremlin.</p>

<h2 id="the-windows-control-panel-being-deprecated-isnt-news">The
Windows Control Panel being “deprecated” isn’t news</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>Virtually every tech media outlet has been reporting that Microsoft
is deprecating the Control Panel in Windows as if that’s some sort of
big revelation we should be outraged about. They’re basing this on the
following, now changed, paragraph someone found buried deep in a Windows
support site somewhere: The Control Panel is a feature that’s been part
of Windows for a long time. It provides a centralized location to view
and manipulate system settings and controls. Through a series of
applets, you can adjust various options ranging from system time and
date to hardware settings, network configurations, and more. The Control
Panel is in the process of being deprecated in favor of the Settings
app, which offers a more modern and streamlined experience. ↫ Windows
support website It seems the sudden avalanche of articles about this
spooked Microsoft, because when you open the same website now, that last
line instead reads: Many of the settings in Control Panel are in the
process of being migrated to the Settings app, which offers a more
modern and streamlined experience. ↫ Windows support website The idea
that the Control Panel is being “deprecated” is not exactly a new one;
it’s been an ongoing process since the release of Windows 8, twelve
years ago now. With every new Windows release, more Control Panel
applets are removed in favour of expanding the Settings application, to
a point where few regular users have a need to open it directly.
Settings still does rely on old Control Panel applets, though, and it
won’t take you many clicks through Settings to end up at a classic
applet. So, while directly opening the Control Panel might not be a
common thing people do, using classic applets sure is. Microsoft may be
changing the verbiage of its support page to remove the word
“deprecated”, but that ain’t fooling anyone: the Control Panel has
already been gutted beyond recognition, and it’s definitely in the
process of being deprecated – in true Microsoft fashion, it’s just
taking them a really long time, because nobody inside Microsoft seems to
really care about Windows anymore.</p>

Street Week Ahead — ‘Super Bowl’ Nvidia earnings stand to test searing
AI trade</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — The rally in U.S. stocks faces an important test […]  with
earnings from chipmaking giant Nvidia NVDA.O, whose blistering run has
powered markets throughout 2024.  </p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 .SPX has pared a sharp drop it suffered after U.S.
economic worries contributed to a sell-off at the beginning of the month
and again stands near a fresh all-time high.  </p>
<p>Nvidia, whose chips are widely seen as the gold standard in
artificial intelligence, has been at the forefront of that rally,
jumping by more than 30% since its recent lows. The stock is up some
150% year-to-date, accounting for around a quarter of the S&amp;P 500’s
17% year-to-date gain.  </p>
<p>The company’s Aug. 28 earnings report, coupled with guidance on
whether it expects corporate investments in AI to continue, could be a
key inflection point for market sentiment heading into what is
historically a volatile time of the year. The S&amp;P 500 has fallen in
September by an average of 0.78% since World War Two, the worst
performance of any month, according to CFRA data.  </p>
<p>“Nvidia is the zeitgeist stock today,” said Mike Smith, a portfolio
manager at Allspring Global Investments, which holds the company’s
shares in its portfolios. “You can think of their earnings four times a
year as the Super Bowl.”  </p>
<p>Some investors are getting ready for fireworks. Traders are pricing
in a swing of around 10.3% in Nvidia’s shares the day after the company
reports earnings, according to data from options analytic firm ORATS.
That’s larger than the expected move ahead of any Nvidia report over the
last three years and well above the stock’s average post-earnings move
of 8.1% over that same period, ORATS data showed.   </p>
<p>The results come at the end of an earnings season during which
investors have taken a less forgiving view of big tech companies whose
earnings failed to justify rich valuations or prodigious spending on AI.
Examples include Microsoft MSFT.O, Tesla TSLA.O and Alphabet GOOGL.O,
whose shares are all down since their July reports.  </p>
<p>Nvidia’s valuations have also climbed, as the stock soared about 750%
since the start of 2023, making it the world’s third-most valuable
company as of Thursday, while also drawing comparisons to the dotcom
bubble of more than two decades ago. The company’s shares trade at about
37 times forward 12-month earnings estimates, compared with a 20-year
average of 29 times, according to LSEG Datastream.  </p>
<p>Market sentiment could depend as much on Nvidia’s guidance as its
results. Evidence that it sees robust demand will be a bullish sign that
companies are continuing to invest rather than pull back in anticipation
of an economic slowdown, said Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager,
equities, at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management.  </p>
<p>Nvidia’s “connection to the largest companies in the U.S. stock
market makes this a must-watch event,” he said. “The biggest piece that
investors want to know is whether there is sustainability and what
demand will look like in ’25 and ’26,” he said.  </p>
<p>The trajectory of monetary policy and the U.S. economy also looms
large for investors. In a Friday morning speech in Jackson Hole,
Wyoming, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell offered an explicit
endorsement of interest rate cuts, saying further cooling in the job
market would be unwelcome.  </p>
<p>Investors will be watching U.S. labor market data on Sept. 6 for
evidence of whether last month’s unexpected downshift in employment
carried over to August. Signs that employment is continuing to weaken
could bring back the recession fears that rocked markets earlier this
month.  </p>
<p>A tight presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris, a
Democrat, and Republican former President Donald Trump may also whip up
market uncertainty in the weeks ahead.  </p>
<p>The August surge in stocks may make it difficult for markets to make
much more headway in the near term even if Nvidia’s earnings impress
Wall Street, said John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds,
which holds shares of the chipmaker.  </p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 trades at 21 times expected earnings, far above its
long-term average of 15.7.  </p>
<p>“The stock market as a whole is still trading at stretched valuations
so the bar remains high,” Belton said.</p>

Very interesting indeed. Certainly, you can make money by selling

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley">Silicon Valley’s
origins are in large part military</a>, of course, so this shouldn’t be
too much of a surprise. But for a while there, in the wake of the
this-is-for-everyone radical inclusion of the web (which was
<em>not</em> a military creation), it seemed like tech was heading in a
different direction. It’s disappointing to see that this was ephemeral
at best.

Copilot falsely accuses court reporter of crimes he covered</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>German journalist Martin Bernklau typed his name and location into
Microsoft’s Copilot to see how his culture blog articles would be picked
up by the chatbot, according to German public broadcaster SWR. The
answers shocked Bernklau. Copilot falsely claimed Bernklau had been
charged with and convicted of child abuse and exploiting dependents. It
also claimed that he had been involved in a dramatic escape from a
psychiatric hospital and had exploited grieving women as an unethical
mortician. Copilot even went so far as to claim that it was
“unfortunate” that someone with such a criminal past had a family
and, according to SWR, provided Bernklau’s full address with phone
number and route planner. ↫ Matthias Bastian So why did Copilot (which
is just OpenAI’s ChatGPT with sparkles) claim Bernklau did all sorts of
horrible things? Well, his occupation – journalist – is a dead giveaway.
He has written a lot of articles covering court proceedings in Tübingen
on abuse, violence, and fraud cases, and since Copilot is just spicy
autocorrect, it has no understanding of context and pinned the various
crimes he covered on Bernklau. Adding in his address, phone number, and
a damn planned route to his home is just the very disgusting icing on
this already disgusting cake. What makes matters even worse, if you can
believe it, is that Bernklau has absolutely no recourse. He contacted
the public prosecutor’s office in Tübingen, but they stated they can’t
press charges because the accusations coming from Copilot aren’t being
made by a real person. And to make it still even worse, Microsoft just
threw its hands in the air and absolved itself of any and all
responsibility by pointing to its terms of service, in which Microsoft
discards liability for content generated by Copilot. Convenient. This is
nothing short of a nightmare scenario that can utterly destroy someone’s
life, and the fact that Microsoft doesn’t care and the law isn’t even
remotely prepared to take serious matters like these on is
terrifying.</p>

id="hurricane-hone-sweeps-past-hawaii-dumping-enough-rain-to-ease-wildfire-fears">Hurricane
Hone sweeps past Hawaii, dumping enough rain to ease wildfire fears</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HONOLULU — Hurricane Hone passed just south of Hawaii on Sunday,
dumping so much rain that the National Weather Service called off its
red flag warnings that strong winds could lead to wildfires on the drier
sides of the islands.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the eastern Pacific saw a new threat emerge as Tropical
Storm Hector formed, packing top sustained winds of 75 kph (45 mph).
There were no coastal watches or warnings in effect as Hector churned
far out at sea, the National Hurricane Center said.</p>
<p>Hone had top winds of 140 kph (85 mph) Sunday morning as it swirled
slowly past the Big Island, centered about 72 kilometers (45 miles) off
its southernmost point, according to Jon Jelsema, a senior forecaster at
the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. He said tropical storm force winds
were blowing across the island’s southeast-facing slopes, carrying up to
30 centimeters or more of rain.</p>
<p>Floods closed Highway 11 between Kona and Hilo, and a higher-altitude
alternative, the Cane Road, was closed by flooding as well, isolating
properties like the Aikane Plantation Coffee Co. outside Pahala, where
owner Phil Becker said his 25-centimeter rain gauge overflowed in the
deluge.</p>
<p>“We’ve got quite a lot of flood damage, the gulches are running full
speed ahead and they’re overflowing the bridges, so we’re trapped down
here, we can’t get in or out,” Becker said Sunday.</p>
<p>Becker said his plantation is off the grid, powered with batteries
charged by solar electricity, and his family is safe, so they have no
reason to evacuate. The weather may even prove beneficial: “We’ve been
in a drought situation so the coffee is probably loving all this rain,”
he said.</p>
<p>Hurricane Gilma, meanwhile, weakened to a still-major Category 3
hurricane Saturday night, but it was far east of Hawaii and forecast to
weaken into a depression before it reaches the islands.</p>
<p>Shelters were opened as Hurricane Hone blew in and beach parks on the
eastern side of the Big Island were closed due to dangerously high surf,
Hawaii County Mayor Mitch Roth said.</p>
<p>Jelsema offered a vivid metaphor for the rainfall: “As the rain gets
pushed up the mountain terrain it wrings it out, kind of like wringing
out a wet towel,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s been really soaking those areas, there’s been flooding of
roads. Roads have been cut off by high flood waters there in the
windward sections of the big island, and really that’s the only portion
of the state that’s had much flooding concern at this point,” he
said.</p>
<p>Hone, whose name is Hawaiian for “sweet and soft,” poked at memories
still fresh of last year’s deadly blazes on Maui, which were fueled by
hurricane-force winds. Red flag alerts are issued when warm
temperatures, very low humidity and stronger winds combine to raise fire
dangers. Most of the archipelago is already abnormally dry or in
drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.</p>
<p>The Aug. 8, 2023, blaze that torched the historic town of Lahaina was
the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century, with 102 dead. Dry,
overgrown grasses and drought helped spread the fire.</p>
<p>Calvin Endo, a Waianae Coast neighborhood board member who lives in
Makaha, a leeward Oahu neighborhood prone to wildfires, has worried for
years about dry brush on private property behind his home. He’s taken
matters into his own hands by clearing the brush himself, but he’s
concerned about nearby homes abutting overgrown vegetation.</p>
<p>“All you need is fire and wind and we’ll have another Lahaina,” Endo
said as the storm approached. “I notice the wind started to kick up
already.”</p>
<p>The cause of the Lahaina blaze is still under investigation, but it’s
possible it was ignited by bare electrical wire and leaning power poles
toppled by the strong winds. The state’s two power companies, Hawaiian
Electric and the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative, were prepared to shut
off power if necessary to reduce the chance that live, damaged power
lines could start fires, but they later said the safety measures would
not be necessary as Hone blew past the islands.</p>
<p>Roth said a small blaze that started Friday night in Waikoloa, on the
dry side of the Big Island, was brought under control without injuries
or damage.</p>

rapper Macklemore cancels Dubai gig over alleged UAE role in Sudan
war</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Dubai, United Arab Emirates — U.S. rapper Macklemore has announced he
is cancelling an upcoming show in Dubai over the UAE’s involvement in
the conflict in Sudan, charges the Gulf state has denied.</p>
<p>The rapper best known for hits like 2012’s “Thrift Shop” made the
announcement in a post on social media on Saturday.</p>
<p>“I have decided to cancel my upcoming show in Dubai this October,” he
said.</p>
<p>“Over the last several months I’ve had a number of people reach out
to me, sharing resources and asking me to cancel the show in solidarity
with the people of Sudan,” he said.</p>
<p>“Until the UAE stops arming and funding the RSF I will not perform
there,” Macklemore added, referring to the paramilitary Rapid Support
Forces that have been battling the Sundanese army.</p>
<p>War has raged since April 2023 between the Sudanese army, under the
country’s de facto ruler Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the RSF, which is
commanded by Burhan’s former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.</p>
<p>For months, the army has accused the UAE of supporting the RSF.</p>
<p>In June, Sudan’s ambassador to the United Nations Al-Harith Idriss
al-Harith Mohamed called Abu Dhabi’s financial and military support for
the RSF the “main reason behind this protracted war.”</p>
<p>The UAE has denied allegations of RSF support as “disinformation,”
saying that it’s efforts are focused exclusively towards de-escalation
and alleviating Sudan’s humanitarian suffering.</p>
<p>Macklemore has released socially aware music in the past, supporting
LGBTQ+ rights while also criticizing ills including poverty and
consumerism.</p>
<p>In his latest track released in May, Macklemore voices support for
Palestinians and also praises students across the United States
protesting against Israel’s war in Gaza.</p>
<p>The song, “Hind’s Hall,” is named after a building at Columbia
University that students recently occupied and renamed after Hind Rajab,
a six-year-old Palestinian girl killed in Gaza.</p>

after floods, Vermont businesses struggling to get visitors to
return</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>burke, vermont — Two bouts of flooding from storms in July has
hampered businesses and destinations in an economically depressed
section of northern Vermont, with some still closed as they continue to
repair damage and others urging visitors, who were deterred by the
weather, to make the trip. </p>
<p>Kingdom Trails, a popular destination for mountain bikers, draws tens
of thousands of visitors a year. But the storms that hit the region on
July 10 and July 30 washed away some roads and bridges, damaged homes
and trails, and discouraged visitors at the height of the season. </p>
<p>Businesses and destinations are picking up the pieces, with some
still closed in nearby Lyndonville, while others want to get the word
out that they are very much open. </p>
<p>“I can’t stress enough that we are open and our community is
welcoming people,” said Abby Long, executive director of Kingdom Trails.
“We’re encouraging folks to not only come visit Kingdom Trails and have
an awesome time but sign up to volunteer mucking and gutting houses for
the morning and then relax on the trails in the afternoon.” </p>
<p>The storms caused $300,000 in damages to the trails — and that
doesn’t account for the loss of membership revenue, she said. The trails
were closed for about a day and a half as crews worked furiously to get
them back open. The cost of repairs comes on top of the $150,000 in
damages suffered in last summer’s flooding. </p>
<p>“That is not sustainable,” Long said. </p>
<p>So far, 341 businesses in Vermont have reported flood damage to the
state this year, according to Economic Development Commissioner Joan
Goldstein. Last summer, about 1,100 businesses were affected, she
said. </p>
<p>In Lyndonville, a popular diner that had been in business since 1978
will not be reopening after getting damaged in the July 10 storms. The
owner of the Miss Lyndonville Diner is having repairs done and plans to
sell the restaurant. She told the Caledonian Record that the flooding
convinced her it was time to retire. </p>
<p>Leaving ski industry</p>
<p>The nearby Village Sport Shop, which also has been in business for
nearly 50 years, has decided to close its flooded Lyndonville shop and
exit the ski industry, according to a social media post by the
business. </p>
<p>“With the multiple flooding events we have endured and the evolution
we have needed to take as a business, we have come to the decision it is
time to turn our focus towards the summer side of the business and
relieve ourselves from the flood risks the lowest lying real estate on
the strip endures,” the post said. The business has a trailside bicycle
shop in East Burke. </p>
<p>A bagel shop and a Walgreens drugstore were still temporarily closed
as they recover from the flood damage. </p>
<p>On Tuesday, President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration
making federal funding available to help individuals and communities
recover from the July 9-10 flooding from the remnants of Hurricane
Beryl. Governor Phil Scott has requested a separate disaster declaration
for the July 30 storms and flooding. </p>
<p>In May, Vermont became the first state to enact a law requiring
fossil fuel companies to pay a share of the damage caused by extreme
weather fanned by climate change. But officials have acknowledged that
collecting any money will depend on litigation against a
much-better-resourced oil industry. </p>
<p>In Burke, a town of about 1,650 that is home to the Burke Mountain
ski area, Kingdom Trails is a huge economic driver, said Town
Administrator Jim Sullivan. </p>
<p>“It’s traumatic, it’s unbelievable the extent that it ripples out,”
he said. “If Kingdom Trails can’t open, people cancel their reservations
at the Airbnbs and at the inns. We have restaurants that are counting on
all of those people coming here. And it’s just a chain event that
eventually dwindles where you have these absolutely beautiful days and
you just don’t have the people here that we normally would have if we
didn’t have this devastation.” </p>
<p>‘Screeching halt’</p>
<p>The East Burke Market was having a really good summer but when the
trails closed down, business “came to a bit of a screeching halt,” said
co-owner Burton Hinton. </p>
<p>Each of the storms caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in road
and property damage, Sullivan said. The town lost a bridge in the July
10 flooding and the whole mountain road in the storm weeks later, he
said. </p>
<p>“We’re still waiting for some direction from the federal government.
In the meantime, everybody has really come together and done a great job
of helping each other. True community,” he said. </p>
<p>About 60 student-athletes who race in cross-country mountain biking
with the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Cycling League, and 40 coaches,
were in Burke to train at Kingdom Trails when the latest flooding hit on
July 30. </p>
<p>The group had to pivot to ride on gravel for a few days but then some
trails reopened quickly, said Michael Morrell, with the National
Interscholastic Cycling Association, who was with them. </p>
<p>“The trail system up here and the trail crew are just so efficient,
and the trails, many of the trails, they drain very well,” he said on
August 1. </p>
<p>Still, he said he felt terrible for those reliant on getting tourists
to visit the local trails. </p>
<p>“I feel so bad that their roads are closed,” Morrell said. ” … We’re
just glad that we can help support them in any way we can.”</p>

<h2 id="us-crossword-fan-creates-puzzles-celebrating-black-heritage">US
crossword fan creates puzzles celebrating Black heritage</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — It started a couple of years ago when Juliana Pache was
doing a crossword puzzle and got stuck.</p>
<p>She was unfamiliar with the reference that the clue made. It made her
think about what a crossword puzzle would look like if the clues and
answers included more of some subjects that she was familiar with,
thanks to her own identity and interests — Black history and Black
popular culture.</p>
<p>When she couldn’t find such a thing, Pache decided to do it herself.
In January 2023, she created blackcrossword.com, a site that offers a
free mini-crossword puzzle every day. And Tuesday marked the release of
her first book, Black Crossword: 100 Mini Puzzles Celebrating the
African Diaspora.</p>
<p>It’s a good moment for it, nearly 111 years after the first crossword
appeared in a New York newspaper. Recent years have seen an increasing
amount of conversation around representation in crossword puzzles, from
who’s constructing them to what words can be used for answers and how
the clues are framed. There’s been a push to expand the idea of the
kinds of “common knowledge” players would have to fill them out.</p>
<p>“I had never made a crossword puzzle before,” Pache, 32, said with a
laugh. “But I was like, ‘I can figure it out.’”</p>
<p>And she did.</p>
<p>Made ‘with Black people in mind’</p>
<p>Each puzzle on Pache’s site includes at least a few clues and answers
connecting to Black culture. The tagline on the site: “If you know, you
know.”</p>
<p>The book is brimming with the kinds of puzzles that she estimates
about 2,200 people play daily on her site — squares made up of five
lines, each with five spaces. She aims for at least three of the clues
to be references to aspects of Black cultures from around the world.</p>
<p>Pache, a native of the New York City borough of Queens with family
ties to Cuba and the Dominican Republic, had a couple of goals in mind
when she started. Primarily, she wanted to create something that Black
people would enjoy.</p>
<p>“I’m making it with Black people in mind,” she said. “And then if
anyone else enjoys it, they learn things from it, that’s a bonus but
it’s not my focus.”</p>
<p>She’s also trying to show the diversity in Black communities and
cultures with the clues and words she uses, and to encourage people from
different parts of the African diaspora to learn about each other.</p>
<p>“I also want to make it challenging, not just for people who might be
interested in Black culture, but people within Black culture who might
be interested in other regions,” she said. “Part of my mission with this
is to highlight Black people from all over, Black culture from all over.
And I think … that keeps us learning about each other.”</p>
<p>What, really, is ‘general knowledge’?</p>
<p>While on the surface if might just seem like a game, the knowledge
base required for crosswords does say something about what kind of
knowledge is considered “general” and “universal” and what isn’t, said
Michelle Pera-McGhee, a data journalist at The Pudding, a site that
focuses on data-driven stories.</p>
<p>In 2020, Pera-McGhee undertook a data project analyzing crossword
puzzles through the decades from a handful of the most well-known media
outlets. The project assessed clues and answers that used the names of
real people to determine a breakdown along gender and race
categories.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the data indicated that for the most part, men were
disproportionately more likely than women to be featured, as well as
white people compared to racial and ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>It’s “interesting because it’s supposed to be easy,” Pera-McGhee
said. “You want … ideally to reference things that people, everybody
knows about because everyone learns about them in school or whatever. …
What are the things that we decide we all should know?”</p>
<p>There are efforts to make crosswords more accessible and
representative, including the recently started fellowship for puzzle
constructors from underrepresented groups at The New York Times, among
the most high-profile crossword puzzles around. Puzzle creators have
made puzzles aimed at LGBTQ+ communities, at women, using a wider array
of references as Pache is doing.</p>
<p>Bottom line, “it is really cool to see our culture reflected in this
medium,” Pache said.</p>
<p>And, Pera-McGhee said, it can be cool to learn new things.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of enriching to have things in the puzzle that you don’t
know about,” she said. “It’s not that the experience of not knowing is
bad. It’s just that it should maybe be spread out along with the
experience of knowing. Both are kind of good in the crossword-solving
experience.”</p>

Kamala Harris Is Seen and Heard</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-25, from: Santa Barbara Indenpent News</p>

Many feminists have waited for this day to come around again, but one
must wonder whether a sufficient number of Americans have changed their
sexist and racist attitudes in order to elect Harris.
