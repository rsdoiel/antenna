Arrives in South Korea to Attend Democracy Summit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Seoul, South Korea — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived
Sunday in South Korea on the first stop of a brief Asia tour also
including the Philippines, as Washington moves to reinforce ties with
two key regional allies.</p>
<p>Blinken landed Sunday afternoon ahead of the third Summit for
Democracy on Monday, an initiative of U.S. President Joe Biden, which
Seoul is hosting this week.</p>
<p>Before arriving in Seoul, Blinken made a brief stop in Bahrain, where
he spoke to King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa about efforts to achieve a
cease-fire in Gaza.</p>
<p>The summit, which runs from March 18-20 will bring together
government officials, NGOs and civil society members.  </p>
<p>Seoul is one of Washington’s key regional allies, and the United
States has stationed about 27,000 American soldiers in the South, to
help protect it against the nuclear-armed North.</p>
<p>Seoul’s conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol has boosted ties with
Washington and sought to bury the historical hatchet with former
colonial power Japan to better guard against Pyongyang’s threats.</p>
<p>Blinken will meet South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, the
ministry said, for discussions that will cover how to boost the
alliance, as Washington and Seoul explore how to improve their so-called
“extended deterrence” against North Korea.</p>
<p>The democracy summit has attracted some criticism due to its
selective invitation list, which excludes countries that consider
themselves democratic, such as Thailand and Turkey.</p>
<p>After Seoul, Blinken heads to Manila, a trip that will reaffirm “our
unwavering commitment to the Philippine ally,” according to State
Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.</p>
<p>He will talk with local officials including President Ferdinand
Marcos Jr. — issues with China including disputes over the South China
Sea are likely to top the agenda.</p>
<p>The U.S. is redoubling efforts to improve longstanding ties with
regional allies such as Manila, in an effort to counterbalance
China.</p>
<p>Beijing recently accused Washington of using the Philippines as a
“pawn” in the dispute over the South China Sea, after a series of
clashes around bitterly-contested islets in the waters.</p>
<p>China claims almost the entire waterway, brushing aside competing
claims from a host of Southeast Asian nations and an international
ruling that has declared its stance baseless.</p>
<p>The South China Sea is strategically vital for several countries —
including China — providing a key route for the import and export of
essential fuel, food and other goods.</p>
<p>China has rapidly grown its naval forces in recent years, and
snatched vast tracts of maritime territory, hoping to project its
military and political power well beyond the country’s shores.</p>

<p>Zero emission vehicles (ZEVs) are commonly understood to be modern
vehicles that do not produce tailpipe emissions. The phrase “ZEV
mandate” is now used to identify California’s effort to phase out the
sale of internal combustion vehicles by 2035, and most people naturally

Military Operations Across Sahel at Risk After Niger Ends
Cooperation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DAKAR, Senegal — The United States scrambled on Sunday to assess the
future of its counterterrorism operations in the Sahel after Niger’s
junta said it was ending its yearslong military cooperation with
Washington following a visit by top U.S. officials.</p>
<p>The U.S. military has hundreds of troops stationed at a major airbase
in northern Niger that deploys flights over the vast Sahel region —
south of the Sahara Desert — where jihadi groups linked to al-Qaida and
the Islamic State group operate.</p>
<p>Top U.S. envoy Molly Phee returned to the capital, Niamey, this week
to meet with senior government officials, accompanied by Marine
Gen. Michael Langley, head of the U.S. military’s African Command. She
had previously visited in December, while acting Deputy Secretary of
State Victoria Nuland traveled to the country in August.</p>
<p>The State Department said Sunday in a post on X, formerly Twitter,
that talks were frank and that it was in touch with the junta. It wasn’t
clear whether the U.S. has any leeway left to negotiate a deal to stay
in the country.</p>
<p>Niger had been seen as one of the last nations in the restive region
that Western nations could partner with to beat back growing jihadi
insurgencies. The U.S. and France had more than 2,500 military personnel
in the region until recently, and together with other European countries
had invested hundreds of millions of dollars in military assistance and
training.</p>
<p>But that changed in July when mutinous soldiers ousted the country’s
democratically elected president and months later asked French forces to
leave.</p>
<p>The U.S. military still had some 650 personnel working in Niger in
December, according to a White House report to Congress. The Niger base
is used for both manned and unmanned surveillance operations. In the
Sahel the U.S. also supports ground troops, including accompanying them
on missions. However, such accompanied missions have been scaled back
since U.S. troops were killed in a joint operation in Niger in 2017.</p>
<p>It’s unclear what prompted the junta’s decision to suspend military
ties. On Saturday, the junta’s spokesperson, Col. Maj. Amadou Abdramane,
said U.S. flights over Niger’s territory in recent weeks were illegal.
Meanwhile, Insa Garba Saidou, a local activist who assists Niger’s
military rulers with their communications, criticized U.S. efforts to
force the junta to pick between strategic partners.</p>
<p>“The American bases and civilian personnel cannot stay on Nigerien
soil any longer,” he told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>After her trip in December, Phee, the top U.S. envoy, told reporters
she had “good discussions” with junta leaders and called on them to set
a timeline for elections in return for restoring military and aid ties.
But she also said the U.S. had warned Niamey against forging closer ties
with Russia.</p>
<p>Neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso, which have experienced two coups
each since 2020, have turned to Moscow for security support. After the
coup in Niger, the military also turned to the Russian mercenary group
Wagner for help.</p>
<p>Cameron Hudson, who served with the Central Intelligence Agency and
State Department in Africa, said the incident shows the diminution of
U.S. leverage in the region and that Niger was angered by Washington’s
attempt to pressure the junta to steer clear of Russia. “This is ironic
since one mantra of the Biden Administration has been that Africans are
free to choose their partners,” he said.</p>
<p>The U.S. delegation visit coincided with the start of Ramadan, a
month of dawn-to-dusk fasting and intense prayer for Muslims. Niger’s
junta leader, Gen. Abdourahmane Tchiani, refused to meet them. A U.S.
press conference at the embassy in Niger was canceled.</p>
<p>The junta spokesperson, speaking on state television, said junta
leaders met the U.S. delegation only out of courtesy and described their
tone as condescending.</p>
<p>Aneliese Bernard, a former U.S. State Department official who
specialized in African affairs and director of Strategic Stabilization
Advisors, a risk advisory group, said the recent visit had failed and
the U.S. needs to take a critical look at how it’s doing diplomacy not
just in Niger but in the whole region.</p>
<p>“What’s going on in Niger and the Sahel cannot be looked at
continuously in a vacuum as we always do,” she said. “The United States
government tends to operate with blinders on. We can’t deny that our
deteriorating relationships in other parts of the world: the Gulf,
Israel and others, all have an influential impact on our bilateral
relations in countries in West Africa.”</p>

“Domato”, a DOM fuzzer from Google Project Zero, to stress test Ladybird
and fix some issues found along the way. The way this works is that
Domato generates randomized web pages with lots of mostly-valid but
strange HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I then load these pages into a debug
build of Ladybird and observe what happens. ↫ Andreas Kling I have high
hopes for Ladybird.</p>

Fantasia Barrino, ‘Color Purple’ Honored at 55th NAACP Image Awards</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Usher was named entertainer of the year at the 55th
annual NAACP Awards on Saturday night, which highlighted works by
entertainers and writers of color.</p>
<p>After Usher accepted his award at the Shrine Auditorium in Los
Angeles, the superstar R&amp;B singer spoke about being thankful about
the journey of his successful career that has lasted three decades.</p>
<p>He reeled off several of his recent big moments including his
sold-out residency in Las Vegas, getting married, releasing his ninth
studio album “Coming Home” and his Super Bowl halftime performance,
which became the most-watched in the game’s history.</p>
<p>Usher beat out Colman Domingo, Fantasia Barrino, Halle Bailey and
Keke Palmer.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how many people do that much stuff in one setting,”
said the multi-Grammy winner, who was presented the award by Oprah
Winfrey. After being surprised by Winfrey’s presence, he thanked those
who have supported him throughout the years.</p>
<p>“This is for you, you, my number ones,” the singer said as the
audience repeated his words back to him. The final words of his speech
were recited lyrics from his popular song “Superstar” from his 2024
album “Confessions,” which has sold more than 10 million units in the
U.S.</p>
<p>Earlier in the ceremony, Usher was honored with the President’s Award
for the singer’s public service achievements through his New Look
Foundation. He thanked the strong women in his life, including his
mother and wife Jenn Goicoechea, whom he married after his Super Bowl
halftime performance last month.</p>
<p>“The say behind or beside or with every strong man is a stronger
woman,” he said.</p>
<p>Queen Latifah hosted the awards ceremony aired live on BET.</p>
<p>“The Color Purple” was awarded best motion picture. The musical film
featured star-studded cast including Barrino, Taraji P. Henson, Domingo,
H.E.R., Danielle Brooks, Corey Hawkins and Bailey.</p>
<p>Barrino, who starred as Celie in the film, won for best actress in a
motion picture.</p>
<p>“I didn’t prepare a speech, because I didn’t think I was going to
win,” the singer-actor said. “I was afraid to play Celie, but I’m glad I
did. Because I kept saying ‘If I don’t win an award, the awards that I
will win will come from the people who watched ‘Color Purple’ and the
women who will relate to her and feel like Oscars when they walk
out.’”</p>
<p>New Edition was inducted into the NAACP Image Awards Hall of Fame.
The induction is bestowed on individuals who are viewed as pioneers in
their respective fields and whose influence shaped their profession.</p>
<p>“We stand here in brotherhood,” said Michael Bivins while his group
members behind him. The Grammy-nominated group includes Bobby Brown,
Johnny Gill, Ralph Tresvant, Ronnie DeVoe and Ricky Bell.</p>
<p>“You’ve seen our story. You know what we’ve been through,” said
Bivins, who spoke about the group overcoming conflict and tension in
their earlier years to now holding a residency in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>“But we call each other every day,” he continued. “We text each other
every day. We check on our families. You watched us grow up. We’re still
growing.”</p>
<p>Damson Idris won best actor in a drama television series for his role
in “Snowfall.” Henson and Domingo took home best supporting roles in
“The Color Purple.” Domingo also won best actor in a motion picture for
his role in “Rustin.”</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Lakeview, Ohio — Residents in a swath of the central United States
hit by deadly tornadoes were cleaning up, assessing damage and helping
neighbors on Saturday. But it will be a long recovery from the storms
that ripped through parts of Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana and Arkansas. </p>
<p>Thursday night’s storms claimed three lives in the Indian Lake area
of Ohio’s Logan County, one of the hardest-hit regions, and about 40
people were injured and dozens of homes damaged in one Indiana
community. Tornadoes were also reported in Illinois and Missouri. </p>
<p>Samantha Snipes, 33, said that when she first heard the tornado
warning, she called her father who lives seven minutes away and told him
to take cover. He said he was trying get into the closet in her
childhood home and then the phone cut out, she told The Associated
Press. </p>
<p>She and her husband attempted to drive down the main road to get to
him but couldn’t and had to get through the back way after the tornado
passed. </p>
<p>“It looked like out of a movie, like Twister,” she said. “My dad’s
garage was leveled. The back of his house is gone. Like everything’s
gone.” </p>
<p>They climbed over everything screaming for him. When they found him,
he wasn’t injured and he told them to stop crying, she said. </p>
<p>Her father, Joe Baker, had always told his children to hide in the
closet if there was ever a tornado. </p>
<p>“We grew up here. Like this is our childhood home,” said Snipes who
Saturday was throwing away things and figuring out what could be saved.
“And you see it on the news. But you never imagine it’s going to happen
to you.” </p>
<p>Steve Wills, a pastor who owns a vacation home down the road on
Orchard Island, said Saturday he was bringing a family crew to finish
cleaning up and cover a hole in the roof. </p>
<p>“We’re saddened for the families that lost people. There’s three
deaths in our community. You know, that breaks our heart,” Wills said.
“But it could have been so much more, so much more. Yeah, so I still
have faith.” </p>
<p>The community has been really helpful, Snipes said. </p>
<p>The school superintendent was dropping off food, clothes and diapers
on Friday. The night of the tornado, neighbors on her dad’s street were
going house to house shutting off the gas, she said. </p>
<p>“Everybody on this road is safe. You know neighbors helping neighbors
is what it’s been,” Snipes said.</p>

Jokes About His Opponent’s Age — and His Own — at DC Roast</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The big news this week, U.S. President Joe Biden said at
a weekend Washington roast, was that two candidates had clinched their
party’s nomination for president. But one was too old, too mentally
unfit for the job, he said. </p>
<p>“The other’s me,” Bidden quipped. </p>
<p>The digs against Republican Donald Trump kept coming from the
president at the annual Gridiron Club and Foundation Dinner, as Biden
deflected ongoing criticism that his memory is hazy and he appears
confused, instead highlighting moments when the 77-year-old Trump has
slipped up, too. </p>
<p>“Don’t tell him, he thinks he’s running against Barack Obama, that’s
what he said,” said Biden, 81, who also quipped that he was staying up
way past his bedtime. </p>
<p>It was the first time Biden has attended the dinner during his
presidency, and comes as the 2024 election looms and the rematch between
Biden and Trump heats up. The annual bacchanalia, now in its 139th year,
traces its history to 1885 — the year President Grover Cleveland refused
to attend. Every president since then has come to at least one
Gridiron. </p>
<p>Biden veered quickly into the somber, though, highlighting what he
sees as a real threat to democracy should Trump — who continues to
falsely claim the 2020 election was stolen — return to the White House.
The speech had echoes of Biden’s campaign remarks, criticizing Trump as
well as too soft on Russian President Vladimir Putin. </p>
<p>“We live in an unprecedented moment in democracy,” he said. “An
unprecedented moment for history. Democracy and freedom are literally
under attack. Putin’s on the march in Europe. My predecessor bows down
to him and says to him, ‘do whatever the hell you want.’” </p>
<p>Biden then introduced the Ukrainian ambassador, Oksana Markarova, and
Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas. </p>
<p>“We will not bow down. They will not bow down, and I will not bow
down,” he said. </p>
<p>Biden, dressed in white-tie attire as is the custom, brought his
daughter Ashley. </p>
<p>The dinner has a reputation as a night of bipartisan mirth, and was
jam-packed with politicians and who’s-who of Washington, including Vice
President Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff, at least eight
other Cabinet members, at least five members of Congress, five governors
and at least five ambassadors. Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who’s in
town for St. Patrick’s Day, also attended. </p>
<p>Also speaking at the dinner were Harris, Michigan Governor Gretchen
Whitmer, a Democrat, and Utah Goveror Spencer Cox, a Republican. </p>
<p>Biden closed out the dinner speaking about the importance of a free
press. Although he may not agree with everything the news media prints,
he said, he understands the necessity of journalism and said he was
still working to bring home journalists Evan Gershkovich and Austin
Tice, one held in Russia, the other who disappeared during a reporting
trip in Syria. </p>
<p>“Good journalism holds a mirror up to society,” he said. “We need
you.” </p>
<p>Biden and Harris were seated at the head table along with other
administration officials and the foreign leaders, plus Gridiron
president Dan Balz of The Washington Post. Also seated at the table were
Balz’s bosses, the Post’s Executive Editor Sally Buzbee and the
newspaper’s owner, Jeff Bezos. </p>
<p>The dinner was held at the Grand Hyatt. No photos or TV were
allowed.</p>

<p>I’m posting a different sort of picture tonight from my friend Peter

<h2 id="blobs">Blobs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: Ed Summers blog, Inkdroid</p>
<p>
On the one hand, all the <a
href="https://huggingface.co/models">models</a> that are available for
download on Hugging Face seem pretty much like programming language
compilers and interpreters that we download and use to write software.
You don’t try to open and read <code>/usr/bin/python3</code> in your
text editor. You trust that it works. Simon Willison <a
href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/3/weird-world-of-llms/">says</a>
these models are like an “opaque blob that can do weird and interesting
things”, and the same analogy seems to hold for the binary executables
we run too.
</p>
<p>
But the big difference is that, once you get various dependencies
assembled correctly, you can <a
href="https://devguide.python.org/getting-started/setup-building/">build</a>
the Python binary. The build depends on other opaque blobs being set up,
like <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc</a>, which in turn can be <a
href="https://gcc.gnu.org/install/build.html">built</a> by bootstrapping
using a lower level language. There are layers of abstraction at work
that can be tested, and reasoned about, which lead us to having some
confidence that things are working correctly. It might get complicated
but we can debug them when they don’t work correctly.
</p>
<p>
This is not true of the opaque blob Large Language Model (LLM). We don’t
have access to the source code that was used to create it. Compiling it
can require a huge investment in time and resources. There’s no way to
debug its logic. If you’re lucky there may be a paper about how it was
built, but some don’t because it is deemed too dangerous.
</p>
<p>
So while it feels the same, it’s really not. I just don’t understand why
people would like to integrate LLMs into applications, for generating
database queries, or API calls. It seems to me like we would want to be
able to reason about these things, and that we lose the ability to do
that when using an LLM. Why does anyone think this is a good idea?
</p>
<p>
And if this style of programming were really to catch on with a new
generation of programmers, would we lose our ability to understand SQL
or REST? Are these really useless abstractions like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">Assembler</a>
that we want to forget? Won’t our ability to reason about our
applications atrophy? The state of software is already kind of bad, and
it seems like some people are dreaming up ways of making it even worse.

<h2 id="wal-g-3.0.0-released">WAL-G 3.0.0 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
WAL-G team is happy to announce the release of WAL-G 3.0.0
</p>
<p>
WAL-G is a tool for archival database restoration for PostgreSQL,
GreenplumDB, MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB, etcd and several other databases.
</p>
<h2>
Noteworthy Changes
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Every database engine can now benefit from failover storage. This
technique can save the day if one of the storage systems goes down.
However, do not forget to monitor them anyway.
</li>
<li>
For Postgres, we have a WAL archiving daemon available. Its primary
purpose is to improve the efficiency of parallel archiving.
</li>
<li>
Additionally, WAL-G supports the partial restoration of a cluster. If
you have large, unnecessary tables, you can exclude them from the
restoration process, the Postgres will skip over the WAL records for
these tables. See
<a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/blob/master/docs/PostgreSQL.md#partial-restore-experimental">docs</a>
for details.
</li>
<li>
Greenplum’s PITR (Point-in-Time Recovery) is undergoing its maturation
process. Partial restore is supported in a similar way to Postgres. We
now have tools to verify the integrity of AOfiles in storage without
actually restoring backups.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
WAL-G v3.0.0 is available for download on our
<a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/releases">GitHub releases
page</a>.
</p>
<p>
Have a nice day!

id="niger-revokes-military-accord-with-us-junta-spokesperson-says">Niger
Revokes Military Accord With US, Junta Spokesperson Says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Niamey, Niger — Niger’s ruling military junta has revoked a military
accord that allows military personnel and civilian staff from the U.S.
Department of Defense on its soil, junta spokesperson Colonel Amadou
Abdramane said on Saturday. </p>
<p>The decision, which takes effect immediately, follows a visit this
week by U.S. officials led by Assistant Secretary of State for African
Affairs Molly Phee and included General Michael Langley, commander of
the U.S. Africa Command. </p>
<p>Abdramane, speaking on television in the West African nation, said
the U.S. delegation did not follow diplomatic protocol and that Niger
was not informed about the composition of the delegation, the date of
its arrival, or the agenda. </p>
<p>He added that the discussions were around the current military
transition in Niger, military cooperation between the two countries and
Niger’s choice of partners in the fight against militants linked to
al-Qaida and the Islamic State group. </p>
<p>Since seizing power in July of last year, the Niger junta, like the
military rulers in neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso, have kicked out
French and other European forces, and turned to Russia for support.
 </p>
<p>“Niger regrets the intention of the American delegation to deny the
sovereign Nigerien people the right to choose their partners and types
of partnerships capable of truly helping them fight against terrorism,”
Abdramane said.</p>
<p>“Also, the government of Niger forcefully denounces the condescending
attitude accompanied by the threat of retaliation from the head of the
American delegation towards the Nigerien government and people,” he
added. </p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Defense did not immediately respond to a
request for comment. </p>
<p>There were about 1,100 U.S. troops in Niger as of last year, where
the U.S. military operates out of two bases including a drone base known
as Air Base 201, built near Agadez in central Niger at a cost of more
than $100 million.  </p>
<p>Since 2018, the base has been used to target Islamic State militants
and Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen, an al-Qaida affiliate, in the
Sahel region. </p>
<p>Abdramane said the status and presence of U.S. troops in Niger was
illegal and violated constitutional and democratic rules because,
according to the spokesperson, it was unilaterally imposed on the
African nation in 2012. </p>
<p>He said Niger was not aware of the number of U.S. civilian and
military personnel on its soil or the amount of equipment deployed and,
according to the agreement, the U.S. military had no obligation to
respond to any request for help against militants. </p>
<p>“In light of all the above, the government of Niger, revokes with
immediate effect the agreement concerning the status of United States
military personnel and civilian employees of the American Department of
Defense on the territory of the Republic of Niger,” Abdramane said.</p>

id="what-makes-people-happy-california-lawmakers-want-to-find-out">What
Makes People Happy? California Lawmakers Want to Find Out</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California Assemblyman Anthony Rendon likes to
spend his spare time away from the Capitol in Sacramento with his
4-year-old daughter at home near Los Angeles. Last weekend, he took her
ice skating and afterward to an indoor playground, then let her get a
donut after she agreed to ride her scooter on the way there. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Those are the types of things that make me happy,” he said this week
in an interview outside the state Assembly chambers, where he’s served
as a lawmaker for a dozen years. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now Rendon, a Democrat who was one of the longest-serving Assembly
speakers in California history, is spending his last year in office
trying to make happiness more central to policymaking. He created a
first-in-the-nation group to study the issue, called the Select
Committee on Happiness and Public Policy Outcomes, which held its first
public hearing this week. </p>
<p>It would be “silly” for lawmakers to not study how they can make
people happier, Rendon said. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Because if we have everybody clothed, everybody housed, everybody
has a job and they’re miserable, then we’ve failed at what we’re trying
to do,” he said, adding that lawmakers should think about happiness as a
priority in policymaking. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In California, three-quarters of adults say they are “very happy” or
“pretty happy,” while 26% say they are “not too happy,” according to a
September 2023 survey from the Public Policy Institute of California.
Adults aged 18 to 34, people who are renters, those without a post-high
school degree, and Californians with an annual household income of
$40,000 or lower tend to be less happy than others. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>California is breaking new ground in the United States. At least 12
state legislatures in the nation have committees focused on mental
health and substance abuse issues, but no other state legislature has a
committee devoted to happiness, according to the National Conference of
State Legislatures. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>But the idea to consider happiness in public policy isn’t
unprecedented: The landlocked country of Bhutan in South Asia
prioritizes happiness as a goal of public policy, measuring it through
something written into its constitution called the Gross National
Happiness Index. The country surveys residents on their level of
happiness, and officials work to increase happiness by providing
residents with free health care and education, protecting cultural
traditions, and preserving forests, said Phuntsho Norbu, consul general
of the Kingdom of Bhutan to the United States. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The government cannot make every person happy, but it should “create
the right conditions that will allow people to pursue happiness,” Norbu
said. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lawmakers on California’s new committee heard this week from experts
about the things that make people happy, what public officials can do to
help and what role state and local government can play. The committee
isn’t set on any solutions yet but plans to release a report with its
findings after lawmakers adjourn for the year at the end of August, said
Katie Talbot, Rendon’s spokesperson. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Assembly member Pilar Schiavo, a Democrat representing part of the
San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles County, hopes the committee’s work
can address poor mental health among youth in California, which her
11-year-old daughter has told her is a big issue in her class at
school. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It’s a true crisis that we have on our hands right now,” Schiavo
said. “This is really getting to the heart of what that crisis is
about.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Research demonstrates that leisure activities, social relationships
and life circumstances contribute to a person’s happiness, said Meliksah
Demir, a professor of happiness at California State University,
Sacramento. Public officials can work toward improving happiness by
investing in mental health resources, making green spaces more
accessible and teaching about the value of happiness early on in
schools, Demir said. </p>
<p>Happiness has wide-ranging benefits that include making people more
likely to vote, more creative and healthier, he said. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Public Policy Institute of California’s September survey found
that 33% of adults overall say they are very satisfied with their job,
31% say they are very satisfied with their leisure activities and 44%
are very satisfied with their housing. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Californians’ level of happiness decreased during the pandemic, but
experts are still researching the decline, said Mark Baldassare, the
group’s survey director. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>California, which is often ahead of other states on issues such as
climate policy and civil rights, is behind many parts of the world in
prioritizing happiness in policymaking, Rendon said. He was inspired to
create the happiness committee in part by a report on happiness released
annually by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions
Network. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Last year’s report said that how people view the effectiveness of
government — including how well it raises money, delivers services and
avoids civil war — can influence their happiness. The United States was
15th in a world happiness ranking based on a three-year average from
2020 to 2022, according to the report. Scandinavian countries, including
Finland and Iceland, ranked the highest. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rendon’s decision to create the happiness committee aligns with his
approach to making state policy that focuses on “bigger picture” social
issues, longtime labor lobbyist Kristina Bas Hamilton said. People have
different perspectives on government involvement in their lives, but the
creation of the committee evokes the ultimate purpose of government, she
said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Government’s role is to provide for its people,” Bas Hamilton said.
“The goal is to have happy citizens. That’s the goal of all public
policy.”</p>

Is Getting Green for Its Largest St. Patrick’s Day Parades</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — St. Patrick’s Day parades across the U.S. are going on
Saturday, promising to turn a river green in the Midwest, commemorate a
big anniversary in the South and put forth the first female leader of a
major beer company as a grand marshal of the New York parade that
predates the nation’s founding. </p>
<p>The holiday commemorates Ireland’s patron saint and was popularized
largely by Irish Catholic immigrants. While St. Patrick’s Day falls on
March 17, it’s being observed with major parades a day early, so it
doesn’t land on Sunday, a day of worship for the Christian
faithful. </p>
<p>Manhattan’s St. Patrick’s Day Parade, which dates to 1762, is one of
the world’s largest Irish heritage festivities. So many people march the
2.4-kilometer route up Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue that the parade is
expected to last more than five hours. </p>
<p>On Saturday, Heineken CEO Maggie Timoney plans to serve as grand
marshal of the Manhattan parade, according to organizers. Originally
from Ireland, she is the first female CEO of a major beer company.</p>
<p>New York City has multiple parades on various dates around its five
boroughs — including, on Sunday, the first St. Patrick’s Day parade
allowing LGBTQ+ groups to march on Staten Island. </p>
<p>Mayor Eric Adams last month announced the plan for the new, privately
organized celebration, arranged after a local organization asked for
years to join the borough’s decades-old parade. That longstanding event,
which does not allow groups to march under LGBTQ+ banners, happened
earlier this month. </p>
<p>The Manhattan parade began allowing LGBTQ+ groups and symbols in
2015, after decades of protests, legal challenges and boycotts by some
politicians. </p>
<p>The Chicago Plumbers Union once again turned the Chicago River green.
Organizers say the tradition, started by the union, uses an
environmentally friendly powder once used to check pipes for leaks. </p>
<p>In Savannah, Georgia, organizers expect a historic crowd to
participate in the parade, which started in 1824. Ahead of the
bicentennial, Georgia’s oldest city had nearly 18,000 hotel rooms booked
for the weekend.</p>

id="post-pandemic-young-chinese-seek-studies-abroad-just-not-in-us">Post-Pandemic,
Young Chinese Seek Studies Abroad, Just Not in US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — In Shanghai, two young women seeking an education abroad
have decided against going to the United States, a destination of choice
for decades that may be losing its shine.</p>
<p>For Helen Dong, a 22-year-old senior studying advertising, it was the
cost. “It doesn’t work for me when you have to spend 2 million [yuan]
[$278,000] but find no job upon returning,” she said. Dong is headed to
Hong Kong this fall instead.</p>
<p>Costs were not a concern for Yvonne Wong, 24, now studying
comparative literature and cultures in a master’s program at the
University of Bristol in Britain. For her, the issue was safety.</p>
<p>“Families in Shanghai usually don’t want to send their daughters to a
place where guns are not banned — that was the primary reason,” Wong
said. “Between the U.S. and the U.K., the U.K. is safer, and that’s the
biggest consideration for my parents.”</p>
<p>With an interest in studying abroad rebounding after the pandemic,
there are signs that the decadeslong run that has sent an estimated 3
million Chinese students to the U.S., including many of the country’s
brightest, could be trending down, as geopolitical shifts redefine
U.S.-China relations.</p>
<p>“International education is a bridge”</p>
<p>Cutting people-to-people exchanges could have a lasting impact on
relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>“International education is a bridge,” said Fanta Aw, executive
director of the NAFSA Association of International Educators, based in
Washington. “A long-term bridge, because the students who come today are
the engineers of the future. They are the politicians of the future;
they are the business entrepreneurs of the future.</p>
<p>“Not seeing that pipeline as strong means that we in the U.S. have to
pay attention, because China-U.S. relations are very important.”</p>
<p>Aw said the decrease is more notable in U.S. undergraduate programs,
which she attributed to a declining population in China from low
birthrates, bitter U.S.-China relations, more regional choices for
Chinese families and the high costs of a U.S. education.</p>
<p>But graduate programs have not been spared. Zheng Yi, an associate
professor of mechanical and industrial engineering at Northeastern
University in Boston, has seen the number of Chinese applicants to one
of the school’s engineering programs shrink to single digits, compared
with 20 to 30 students before the pandemic.</p>
<p>He said the waning interest could be partly due to China’s growing
patriotism that nudges students to attend Chinese institutes
instead.</p>
<p>Andrew Chen, chief executive officer of Pittsburgh-based WholeRen
Education, which has advised Chinese students in the U.S. for the past
14 years, said the downward trend is here to stay.</p>
<p>“This is not a periodic wave,” he said. “This is a new era.” The
Chinese government has sidelined English education, hyped gun violence
in the U.S., and portrayed the U.S. as a declining power. As a result,
Chen said, Chinese families are hesitant to send their children to the
U.S.</p>
<p>China’s criticisms of the U.S.</p>
<p>Beijing has criticized the U.S. for its unfriendly policy toward some
Chinese students, citing an executive order by former President Donald
Trump to keep out Chinese students who have attended schools with strong
links to the Chinese military.</p>
<p>The Chinese foreign ministry also has protested that a number of
Chinese students have been unfairly interrogated and sent home upon
arrival at U.S. airports in recent months. Spokeswoman Mao Ning recently
describing the U.S. actions as “selective, discriminatory and
politically motivated.”</p>
<p>State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said fewer than “one
tenth of 1%” of Chinese students have been detained or denied
admission.</p>
<p>Another State Department official said Chinese students selected for
U.S.-funded exchange programs have been harassed by Chinese state
agents. Half of the students have been forced to withdraw, and those who
participated in the programs have been faced with harassment after
returning to China, the official said, speaking to reporters on the
condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>The U.S.-China Education Trust acknowledged the predicament facing
Chinese students. “Students from China have been criticized in the U.S.
as potential spies, and in China as too influenced by the West,” the
organization said in a report following a survey of Chinese students in
the U.S. between 1991 and 2021.</p>
<p>Still, many young Chinese, especially those whose parents were
foreign educated, are eager to study abroad. The China-based education
service provider New Oriental said the students hope degrees from
reputable foreign universities will improve their career prospects in a
tough job market at home, where the unemployment rate for those 16 to 24
stood at nearly 15% in December.</p>
<p>But their preferences have shifted from the U.S. to the U.K.,
according to EIC Education, a Chinese consultancy specializing in
international education. The students like the shorter study programs
and the quality and affordability of a British education, as well as the
feeling of safety.</p>
<p>Wong, the Shanghai student now studying in the U.K., said China’s
handling of the pandemic pushed more young people to go abroad. “After
three years of tight controls during the pandemic, most people have
realized the outside world is different, and they are more willing to
leave,” she said.</p>
<p>The State Department issued 86,080 F-1 student visas to Chinese
students in the budget year ending in September, up nearly 40% from the
year earlier. Still, the number remains below the pre-pandemic level of
105,775.</p>

OS/2 2.0</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>This release marks the last time that Microsoft would release an OS/2
beta to developers, instead with the runaway success of Windows 3.0,
Microsoft would remove resources from the constrained OS/2, and refocus
both on Windows 3.1, and Windows NT. Thanks to one of my Patrons – Brian
Ledbetter, the much-sought Microsoft OS/2 2.0 Pre-Release 2 is now
available! So obviously the first thing to do was to re-create the
original magical screenshot. ↫ neozeed at VirtuallyFun We already talked
about this rediscovered release, but this article contains even more
detailed information, this time from the person who bought the copy off
eBay.</p>

<h2 id="home-price-key-reason-some-voters-frustrated-by-us-economy">Home
Price Key Reason Some Voters Frustrated by US Economy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Lori Shelton can’t fathom ever having the money to buy a
home — and that’s a major reason why so many voters feel down on the
economy ahead of this year’s presidential election.</p>
<p>Shelton, 67, drives an Uber to help pay rent in Aurora, Colorado. An
advance on her pay covered her apartment’s security deposit. But it also
cut into her next paycheck, leaving her bank account dangerously low
when the rent was due — a cycle that never seems to end.</p>
<p>“I’m always one step behind,” said Shelton, her voice choking up.
“It’s a nightmare, it’s a freaking nightmare right now.”</p>
<p>The United States is slogging through a housing affordability crisis
that was decades in the making. At the root of this problem: America
failed to build enough homes for its growing population. The shortage
strikes at the heart of the American dream of homeownership — dampening
U.S. President Joe Biden’s assurances that the U.S. economy is strong
and underscoring the degree to which Republican Donald Trump, the former
president and presumptive GOP nominee for 2024, has largely overlooked
the shortage.</p>
<p>The lack of housing has caused a record number of renters to devote
an excessive amount of income to housing, according to a Harvard
University analysis. Not enough homes are for sale or being built,
keeping prices elevated. Average mortgage rates have more than doubled
and further worsened affordability.</p>
<p>In fact, the Census Bureau reported that homeownership fell slightly
at the end of last year in an otherwise solid economy. If it wasn’t for
shelter costs, inflation — Biden’s most pronounced economic problem —
would be running at a healthy and stable 1.8%. Instead, it’s hovering
around 3.2%.</p>
<p>Administration officials are confident that shelter inflation will
soon cool, but the damage across several years is apparent to advocates
and economists.</p>
<p>“I’ve been doing housing work for 30 years — the housing
affordability challenge is the worst I’ve ever seen in my career,” said
Shaun Donovan, a former secretary of Housing and Urban Development in
the Obama years who now leads the nonprofit Enterprise Community
Partners.</p>
<p>Donovan noted that this is an increasingly bipartisan challenge that
could bring the political parties together. Expensive housing was once
the domain of Democratic areas such as New York City and San Francisco.
It’s now moved into Republican states as places such as Boise, Idaho,
grapple with higher prices.</p>
<p>“It is a first-tier issue almost everywhere,” he said. “And that is
changing the national politics around it in a way that I think is quite
different than I’ve ever seen.”</p>
<p>Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said that the
outcome of the November election could ultimately depend on the path of
30-year mortgage rates.</p>
<p>Rates currently average about 6.74%. If they dropped closer to 6%,
the odds of a Biden victory would increase. But rates moving near 8%
might enable Trump to prevail, Zandi said.</p>
<p>“Given the current housing affordability crisis, higher rates will
make owning a home completely out of reach for nearly all potential
first-time homebuyers,” he said. “Since homeownership is a key part of
the American dream, if it appears unattainable, this will deeply impact
voters’ sense of the economy.”</p>
<p>Biden, a Democrat, acknowledged the pain many are feeling in his
State of the Union address earlier this month and in his budget proposal
released on Monday.</p>
<p>The president wants to fund the building and preservation of 2
million housing units — a meaningful sum, but not enough to solve the
shortage. He also proposed a tax credit worth up to $10,000 to
homebuyers. Over the past three years, he has increased rental
assistance to 100,000 households.</p>
<p>“The bottom line is we have to build, build, build,” Biden said
Monday in a speech to the National League of Cities. “That’s how we
bring down housing costs for good.”</p>
<p>Rapidly climbing home prices were also a festering problem under
Trump, who first achieved celebrity status as a real estate developer.
While president, Trump called for limiting construction in the suburbs.
He claimed during the 2020 election that Biden’s policies to spur
building and affordability would “destroy your neighborhood.”</p>
<p>During the 2018 to 2020 years of Trump’s presidency, the country’s
housing shortage surged 52% to 3.8 million units, according to the
mortgage company Freddie Mac.</p>
<p>The Associated Press contacted Trump’s campaign for his policy plans
but did not get a response. The America First Policy Institute, a think
tank promoting Trump’s vision, said the key is to cut government
borrowing to reduce mortgage rates. The former president has pledged to
reduce deficits, but an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible
Federal Budget shows that his policies in office will have likely added
more than $8 trillion to the national debt.</p>
<p>“The best way for us to improve access to homeownership for young
people is to get interest rates back down, not to provide subsidies that
cause housing unaffordability to worsen,” said Mike Faulkender, chief
economist at the institute.</p>
<p>Lower rates might play well with voters, but most economists say they
would at best offer temporary financial relief. Purchase prices would
likely adjust upward in response to greater demand from falling
rates.</p>
<p>Construction, the more enduring solution, would take years to achieve
and require new rules by states and cities. The administration is trying
to incentivize zoning changes, but the major choices are outside the
White House’s control.</p>
<p>“Even as incomes are going up and the economy is doing well and
inflation is coming down, people can’t buy homes,” said Daryl
Fairweather, chief economist at the brokerage Redfin. “That’s like the
biggest problem for Biden because it’s not one that he can solve.”</p>
<p>The general rule of thumb is that people should pay no more than 30%
of their income on rent or a mortgage. A typical household looking to
buy a home would have to devote 41% of its income to mortgage payments,
according to Redfin.</p>
<p>There are far-reaching economic risks because of this. High housing
costs can lead people to cut back spending elsewhere. Advocates said it
enables landlords to neglect their properties since there is always a
ready tenant.</p>
<p>Evictions can worsen health and educational outcomes for children and
exact an even wider cost on society, said Zach Neumann, a Denver-based
lawyer who provides more than $30 million annually in rental assistance
through the nonprofit Community Economic Defense Project.</p>
<p>The cumulative costs of evicting poorer renters are “$20,000 to
$30,000 a year when you include shelter nights and emergency room
visits,” Neumann said. “It’s really overwhelming when you think about
the total numbers and these folks are fighting to have a roof over their
heads.”</p>
<p>While there is bipartisan agreement on the need for more housing,
there has yet to be a significant plan that has passed the House and
Senate. Biden has proposed housing aid throughout his administration
that never materialized.</p>
<p>“Had Congress passed some of the investments that the president has
called for since the beginning of the administration, had they done that
three years ago, as he was advocating, we’d have affordable units coming
online right now,” said Daniel Hornung, deputy director of the White
House National Economic Council.</p>
<p>But Mark Calabria, who was director of the Federal Housing Finance
Agency during the Trump administration, said that many of the federal
tools to increase housing such as the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit
could further push up demand without adding enough construction.</p>
<p>“My worry would be we’ve done a number of things that increased
demand when the problem is supply,” said Calabria, now an adviser with
the libertarian Cato Institute.</p>
<p>But for renters such as Lori Shelton in Colorado, the debate about
how to add housing supply is cold comfort when she owes rent now. She’s
previously dealt with the threat of eviction and late fees. She gets
some rent money from her son, but she has also relied at times on her
church to cover the $2,399 a month.</p>
<p>“I don’t think the majority of us have that savings account,” she
said. “If you spend that much on your rent and your groceries and your
car and your bills, you don’t have much for a fallback.”</p>

<p>
Four things.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
We’re selling ourselves out by letting Facebook own a new social network
and not putting that energy into building something that preserves our
choice.
</li>
<li>
I understand that Facebook’s claims of supporting the Fedisphere won’t
amount to anything. They will end up controlling what interop means,
which means we end up with yet another app store, with all the nonsense
that comes with. Welcome to CyberDisneyland.
</li>
<li>
You know all this, as well as I do. But we have decided not to care.
</li>
<li>
This is exactly how we snookered ourselves into using Twitter for 17
years.
</li>
</ol>
