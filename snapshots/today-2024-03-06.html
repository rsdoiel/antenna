Targets Houthi Revenue With New Sanctions, Treasury Dept Says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States on Wednesday issued sanctions
targeting two companies and two vessels that the Treasury Department
said had facilitated commodities shipments on behalf of a network of an
Iranian-backed Houthi financial facilitator.</p>
<p>The action targets two Hong Kong- and Marshall Islands-based ship
owners and two vessels for their role in shipping commodities on behalf
of Sa’id al-Jamal, the Treasury Department said in a statement.</p>
<p>The revenue from the commodity sales supports the Houthis and their
attacks against international shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of
Aden, the department said.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s action represented the latest bid by the U.S. to pressure
the Iran-backed Houthi militant group over attacks in shipping. Last
month, Washington imposed sanctions on oil tankers as well as two
companies it accused of working with al-Jamal.</p>

<p>
Following Super Tuesday’s results, there hasn’t been a major paradigm
shift, even after the suspension of Republican contender Nikki Haley’s
presidential campaign. But many people in the world of business are
laser-focused on the outcomes of November’s election because of what it
can mean for antitrust policy. We delve in. Also: what’s included in
spending packages before the House and how a lack of water is impacting
the Panama Canal.

“AI” to Explorer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>According to my sources, AI Explorer is the blockbuster AI experience
that will separate AI PCs from non-AI PCs. It’s described as an
“advanced Copilot” with a built-in history/timeline feature that turns
everything you do on your computer into a searchable moment using
natural language. It works across any app and allows users to search for
previously opened conversations, documents, web pages, and images. For
example, you could type, “Find me that list of restaurants Jenna said
she liked,” and Windows can bring up the exact conversation you were
having when Jenna mentioned those restaurants. Even vague prompts should
work, like “Find me that thing about dinosaurs,” Windows will pull up
every word, phrase, image, and related topic about dinosaurs that you’ve
previously opened on your computer. The AI Explorer app can also
understand context, help jumpstart projects or workflows, and even
suggest tasks based on what’s currently on screen. For example, suppose
you’re looking at an image in an app. In that case, the AI Explorer will
automatically show an “edit image” button that lets you type out your
criteria, such as “remove this image’s background using the Photos app.”

<h2 id="the-one-big-change-to-the-secs-climate-rule">The One Big Change
to the SEC’s Climate Rule</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-06, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTY0Njk3Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1Nzk3MjM2MH0.YkgTA7ivnix7utGoBHonNoBt5T6P0mQ8eIyDg6zO7Mw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The Securities and Exchange Commission will vote today on a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/sec-climate-disclosure-rule" target="_self">highly
anticipated rule</a> that would require companies to disclose
information about their climate-related risks to investors. The rule was
first proposed two years ago, and since then it has undergone some
dramatic changes.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the most dramatic: Most of the climate-related disclosures the
rule covers are now mandatory only if they’re considered “material.”
Under the original rule, all public companies would have been required
to calculate and report the greenhouse gas emissions they are directly
responsible for, known as scope 1 emissions, and the emissions from the
electricity they use, known as scope 2 — no exceptions. But under the
final rule, companies only have to report this information if they deem
it material — i.e. if there is “a substantial likelihood that the
disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable
investor as having significantly altered the ‘total mix’ of information
made available,” according to a 1976 Supreme Court decision.
</p>
<p>
Further, only about 40% of domestic public companies will even be
required to consider whether their emissions are material. Smaller
companies and emerging growth businesses — generally companies with less
than $1.2 billion in annual revenues — are exempt.
</p>
<p>
“By shifting to a materiality standard, they are leaving a huge gap in
the information available to investors and the public,” Kathy Fallon,
the director of land and climate at the Clean Air Task Force told me.
“That’s going to hurt companies and the climate in the long run.”
</p>
<p>
This wasn’t entirely unexpected. Last year, reports emerged that the
Commission would likely remove a requirement that companies tally up and
report a third category of their emissions, known as scope 3, which
includes those associated with their supply chains and the use of their
products. Then last week, <em>Reuters</em> reported that the SEC would
also soften the requirements for disclosing scope 1 and 2 emissions by
subjecting them to this materiality test.
</p>
<p>
There is no special definition for when emissions are considered
material. But the climate disclosure rule does discuss some examples of
when a company’s scope 1 or scope 2 emissions may <em>become</em>
material. One is if there is a transition risk associated with those
emissions — for example, if a company anticipates that future
regulations would increase their costs. Another is if a company has
articulated a climate goal, like an ambition to achieve net-zero
emissions, to the public. As with other SEC disclosures subject to a
material standard, it will be entirely up to these companies to
determine whether their emissions are material, and they will not have
to share their analysis with investors.
</p>
<p>
Experts don’t expect this to lead to a total lack of emissions
reporting. If a company fails to disclose its emissions, it could open
up the business to fines from the SEC or lawsuits from investors if the
information is later determined to be, in fact, material. Many
companies, prodded by their lawyers, are likely to play it safe and
disclose. “It’s hard to make an argument that scope 1 emissions are not
material,” Jameson McLennan, a sustainable finance analyst at
BloombergNEF, told me.
</p>
<p>
But there still may be a spectrum. John Tobin, a professor of practice
at Cornell University’s business school and a former managing director
of sustainability at Credit Suisse, told me that big, white collar
companies like banks and tech companies that don’t directly emit much
may not need to disclose, whereas manufacturing and industrial companies
that directly burn fossil fuels to produce their products, absolutely
should. That being said, those white collar businesses should still
consider their scope 2 emissions material, Tobin said, as they tend to
use a substantial amount of electricity and could be at risk of cost
increases if regulations change.
</p>
<p>
Where Tobin thinks the rule really falls short is in lacking
requirements to disclose certain kinds of scope 3 emissions —
particularly upstream supply chain emissions. Why would an investor care
more about the emissions from the electricity Toyota uses than the
emissions from the steel it buys? The latter is more likely to pose a
significant risk to the company’s business due to carbon regulations. “A
lot of the emissions associated with industrial activity have very
little to do with electricity,” he told me.
</p>
<p>
By telling companies they only have to report emissions that are
material, the Commission is essentially saying that a company’s
emissions are not inherently material to an investor’s understanding of
risk. Allowing companies to opt out of emissions reporting “misses the
whole point of climate disclosures,” said Fallon. “The whole point is to
make available the information that investors want, not just the
information that companies want to give.” Investors want to know how
exposed a company may be to changes in climate policies, energy prices,
or shifts in consumer sentiments.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, tying the list of required disclosures to a
materiality test could be what ultimately preserves the rule when it
inevitably ends up in court. Many groups have already threatened to sue
the commission if it exceeds its legal authority. These include the
National Association of Manufacturers.
</p>
<p>
“The NAM has been clear that a failure to bring the rule back within the
agency’s statutory authority could invite legal action. On the other
hand, a balanced, workable rule could obviate the need for litigation,”
<a href="https://nam.org/previewing-the-secs-climate-rule-30364/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>
the group’s vice president of domestic policy, Charles Crain.
</p>
<p>
The rule will still likely surface valuable information for investors
and others keen to get their hands on more consistent, comparable data
about certain companies’ emissions and vulnerability to climate change.
But it will also leave huge reporting gaps that dilute the overall
utility of that information.
</p>
<p>
“The fact that the SEC is providing uniform requirements for reporting
is still an improvement upon what we had before,” said Fallon. “But the
final rule doesn’t go far enough to give investors the information they
need to make informed decisions.”

<h2 id="pluralistic-electrons-not-molecules-06-mar-2024">Pluralistic:
Electrons, not molecules (06 Mar 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-06, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Electrons, not molecules: Renewables don’t generate
above-average returns for Exxon’s shareholders. Hey look at this:
Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023
Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Podcasts,
events and more. Latest books: You keep readin’ em, I’ll keep writin’
‘em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I’ll keep writin’ ‘em. Colophon: All
the rest. Electrons, not molecules (permalink) When hydrocarbon barons
do their damndest to torch the Earth with fossil fuels, they call us
dreamers. They insist that there’s a hard-nosed reality – humanity needs
energy – and they’re the ones who live in it, while we live in the fairy
land where the world can run on sunshine and virtuous thoughts. Without
them making the tough decisions, we’d all be starving in the frigid
dark. Here’s the thing: they’re full of shit. Mostly. Humanity does need
energy if we’re going to avoid starving in the frigid dark, but that
energy doesn’t have to come from fossil fuels. Indeed, in the long-term,
it can’t. Even if you’re a rootin’ tootin, coal-rollin’ climate denier,
there’s a hard-nosed reality you can’t deny: if we keep using fossil
fuels, they will someday run out. Remember “peak oil” panic? Fossil
fuels are finite, and the future of the human race needn’t be. We need
more. Thankfully, we have it. Despite what you may have heard,
renewables are more than up to the task. Indeed, it’s hard to overstate
just how much renewable energy is available to us, here at the bottom of
our gravity well. I failed to properly appreciate it until I read Deb
Chachra’s brilliant 2023 book, How Infrastructure Works:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/17/care-work/#charismatic-megaprojects
Chachra, an engineering prof and materials scientist, offers a
mind-altering reframing of the question of energy: we have a material
problem, not an energy problem. If we could capture a mere 0.4% of the
sun’s rays that strike the Earth, we could give every person on the
planet the energy budget of a Canadian (like an American, only colder).
Energy isn’t just wildly abundant, though: it’s also continuously
replenished. For most of human history, we’ve treated energy as scarce,
eking out marginal gains in energy efficiency – even as we treated
materials as disposable, using them once and consigning them to a midden
or a landfill. That’s completely backwards. We get a fresh shipment of
energy every time the sun (or the moon) comes up over the horizon. By
contrast, new consignments of material are almost unheard of – the few
odd ounces of meteoric ore that survive entry through Earth’s
atmosphere. A soi-dissant adult concerned with the very serious business
of ensuring our species isn’t doomed to the freezing, starving darkness
of an energy-deprived future would think about nothing save for this
fact and its implications. They’d be trying to figure out how to
humanely and responsibly gather the materials needed for the harvest,
storage and distribution of this nearly limitless and absolutely free
energy. In other words, that Very Serious, Hard-Nosed Grown-Up should be
concerned with using as few molecules as possible to harvest as many
electrons as possible. They’d be working on things like turning disused
coal-mines into giant gravity batteries:
https://www.euronews.com/green/2024/02/06/this-disused-mine-in-finland-is-being-turned-into-a-gravity-battery-to-store-renewable-ene
Not figuring out how to dig or flush more long-dead corpses out of the
Earth’s mantle to feed them into a furnace. That is a profoundly
unserious response to the human need for energy. It’s caveman shit:
“Ugh, me burn black sticky gunk, make cave warm, cough cough cough.”
Enter Exxon CEO Darren Woods, whose interview with Fortune’s Michal
Lev-Ram and editor Alan Murray contains this telling quote: “we
basically focus our technology on transforming molecules and they happen
to be hydrogen and carbon molecules”:
https://fortune.com/2024/02/28/leadership-next-exxonmobil-ceo-darren-woods/
As Bill McKibben writes, this is a tell. A company that’s in the
molecule business is not in the electron business. For all that Woods
postures about being a clear-eyed realist beating back the fantasies of
solarpunk-addled greenies, Woods does not want a future where we have
all our energy needs met:
https://billmckibben.substack.com/p/the-most-epic-and-literal-gaslighting
That’s because the only way to get that future is to shift from
molecules – whose supply can be owned and therefore sold by Exxon – to
electrons, which that commie bastard sun just hands out for free to
every person on our planet’s surface, despite the obvious moral hazard
of all those free lunches. As Woods told Fortune, when it comes to
renewables, “we don’t see the ability to generate above-average returns
for our shareholders.” Woods dresses this up in high-minded seriousness
kabuki, saying that Exxon is continuing to invest in burning rotting
corpses because our feckless species “waited too long to open the
aperture on the solution sets terms of what we need as a society.” In
other words, it’s just too late for solar. Keep shoveling those corpses
into the furnace, they’re all that stands between you and the freezing,
starving dark. Now, this is self-serving nonsense. The problem of
renewables isn’t that it’s too late – it’s that they don’t “generate
above-average returns for our shareholders” (that part, however, is
gospel truth). But let’s stipulate that Woods sincerely believes that it
is too late. It’s pretty goddamned rich of this genocidal, eminently
guillotineable monster to just drop that in the conversation without
mentioning the role his company played in getting us to this juncture.
After all, #ExxonKnew. 40 years ago, Exxon’s internal research predicted
climate change, connected climate change to its own profits, and
predicted how bad it would be today. Those predictions were spookily
accurate and the company took them to heart, leaping into action. For 40
years, the company has been building its offshore drilling platforms
higher and higher in anticipation of rising seas and superstorms – and
over that same period, Exxon has spent millions lobbying and sowing
disinformation to make sure that the rest of us don’t take the emergency
as seriously as they are, lest we switch from molecules to electrons.
Exxon knew, and Exxon lied. McKibben quotes Woods’ predecessor Lee
Raymond, speaking in the runup to the Kyoto Treaty negotiations: “It is
highly unlikely that the temperature in the middle of the next century
will be significantly affected whether policies are enacted now or 20
years from now.” When Woods says we need to keep shoveling corpses into
the furnace because we “waited too long to open the aperture on the
solution sets terms of what we need as a society,” he means that his
company lied to us in order to convince us to wait too long. When Woods
– and his fellow enemies of humanity in the C-suites of Chevron and
other corpse-torching giants – was sending the arson billions to his
shareholders, he held back a healthy share to fund this deceit. He
colluded with the likes of Joe Manchin (“[D-POLLUTION]” -McKibben) to
fill the Inflation Reduction Act with gifts for molecules. The point of
fantasies like “direct air carbon-capture” is to extend the economic
life of molecule businesses, by tricking us into thinking that we can
keep sending billions to Exxon without suffocating in its waste-product.
These lies aren’t up for debate. Back in 2021, Greenpeace tricked
Exxon’s top DC lobbyist Keith McCoy into thinking that he was on a Zoom
call with a corporate recruiter and asked him about his work for Exxon,
and McCoy spilled the beans:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/01/basilisk-tamers/#exxonknew He
confessed to everything: funding fake grassroots groups and falsifying
the science – he even names the senators who took his bribes. McCoy
singled out Manchin for special praise, calling him “a kingmaker” and
boasting about the “standing weekly calls” Exxon had with Manchin’s
office. Exxon’s response to this nine-minute confession was to insist
that their most senior American lobbyist “wasn’t involved at all in
forming policy positions.” McKibben points to the forthcoming book The
Price Is Wrong, by Brett Christophers, which explains how the
neoclassical economics establishment’s beloved “price signals” will
continue to lead us into the furnace:
https://www.versobooks.com/products/3069-the-price-is-wrong The crux of
that book is: We cannot expect markets and the private sector to solve
the climate crisis while the profits that are their lifeblood remain
unappetizing. Nearly 100 years ago, Upton Sinclair wrote, “It is
difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends
on his not understanding it.” Today, we can say that it’s impossible to
get an oil executive to understand that humanity needs electrons, not
molecules, because his shareholders’ obscene wealth depends on it. [back

<p>
<strong></strong>The Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to
issue a long-awaited, final rule today on what climate-related
disclosures public companies have to make to their investors. The rules
will cover a company’s greenhouse gas emissions and its exposure to
climate-related risks, like extreme weather or future regulations. The
SEC’s initial proposal has been the center of a lobbying firestorm. The
most contentious aspect asked companies to disclose emissions indirectly
related to their business, known as “scope 3” emissions. As

Emily Pontecorvo explained</a>: “That means a company like Amazon
wouldn’t just have to report the emissions from its warehouses and
delivery trucks, but also an estimate of the emissions associated with
producing and using all the products it sells.”<br/><br/>Lobbying groups
pushed back hard on this, and probably won: The SEC is

going to soften rules for disclosing scope 1 and scope 2 emissions,
which are greenhouse gases produced directly by the company through its
own operations, and through its electricity use, respectively. “The
draft rule now under consideration would compel such disclosures only if
companies deem they are material,” <em>Reuters</em> reported.

yesterday. But its warming effects will linger, resulting in above
normal temperatures over nearly all land areas through May. “Every month
since June 2023 has set a new monthly temperature record – and 2023 was
by far the warmest year on record,” said WMO Secretary-General Celeste
Saulo. “El Niño has contributed to these record temperatures, but
heat-trapping greenhouse gases are unequivocally the main culprit.” She
continued: “Ocean surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific clearly
reflect El Niño. But sea surface temperatures in other parts of the
globe have been persistently and unusually high for the past 10 months.
The January 2024 sea-surface temperature was by far the highest on
record for January. This is worrying and can not be explained by El Niño
alone.”

published in the journal<em> Nature Reviews Earth &amp; Environment</em>
suggests the Arctic could be ice-free during the summer months as soon

Alexandra Jahn, an associate professor of atmospheric and oceanic
sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder and a lead author of the

to pass HB 1645</a>, a bill prohibiting offshore wind turbines in state
waters. Florida doesn’t have very strong offshore winds, and hurricanes
pose a big risk to turbines, which explains why the state has not a

Actually Help the Climate?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-06, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
For a few weeks now, Heatmap’s staff writer, Emily Pontecorvo, has been
trying to figure out if installing rooftop solar panels on your home
actually reduces carbon pollution in a systematic way. In other words:
If you own a home, and install solar panels on it, are you doing
anything to change how much fossil fuel gets burned in your region or
around the world? Or — somewhat counterintuitively — will your panels
just increase the cost of electricity near you while shifting demand for
those fossil fuels around?
</p>
<p>
On this week’s episode, we try to answer these questions in a satisfying
way. Princeton Professor Jesse Jenkins and I welcome Emily to the
podcast to discuss the messy truth of distributed solar power.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Emily Pontecorvo: </strong>My question is, if you’re taking this
solar-shaped hole out of electricity demand and that’s displacing a
cheaper utility-scale solar project, how do we go from that to you’re
not having an effect on emissions? Why is displacing that cheaper option
than meaning that it’s not as an effective climate action?<br/> <br/>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>Well, because basically there’s a
certain amount of demand for solar-shaped production in the electricity
system, right? And if you’re reducing demand for electricity at exactly
the time that a utility solar project would produce, then you’re making
the economics of building more solar incrementally worse as you add more
distributed solar.<br/> <br/> We still get basically the same amount of
overall solar power in equilibrium. Like, you know, that’s the amount
that’s profitable for people to invest in. It’s just that you’ve shifted
it from, again, cheaper projects at larger scale to more expensive
projects at smaller scale, particularly in the U.S. We can come back to
why the U.S. market is so, I think, broken and so much more expensive
than it needs to be. <br/> <br/> But particularly in the US, it is much
more expensive, like three or four times more expensive, to build a
megawatt worth of solar panels in 10 kilowatt increments at a bunch of
different homes than it is to build one megawatt of solar on a big
landfill or in a farm or on a big box store. <br/> <strong><br/>
Pontecorvo </strong>: So is the idea that, do you get less solar overall
or is it? <br/> <strong><br/> Jenkins </strong>: No, you basically get
the same amount. You just get the same amount of solar and it’s just
more expensive. <br/> <strong><br/> Pontecorvo </strong>: Why does it
matter then? I mean, obviously it matters. It’s a better outcome to have
a cheaper clean electricity system. But …<br/> <br/>
<strong>Jenkins</strong>: No, it’s a great question. <br/> <br/> So why
does it matter? I mean, there’s two questions. <br/> <br/> You were
asking before, like, does it amount to an effective climate action?
Well, if it doesn’t increase the overall supply of solar power in the
regional grid, then no, it’s not an effective climate action. <br/>
<br/> It might be fine for you to do it as a personal decision for other
reasons like economics or feeling like you don’t want to keep paying
your utility because you don’t like the utility and you want to generate
your own power. Like there’s lots of other reasons why you might do
this. Or because you want to save land, right? We can talk about the
sort of land-saving potential distributed generation, which I think is
probably the best case for it. <br/> <br/> But in terms of climate
impact, it’s null. If you’re not increasing the supply of clean energy
overall, you’re just substituting one clean megawatt hour for another
clean megawatt hour. <br/> <br/> Why does it matter that we’re making
that megawatt hour more expensive? Well, at the end of the day, we have
to keep our electricity supply affordable as we decarbonize. Both
because it’s important for equity reasons, because we don’t want people
who have a hard time paying their bills to have to pay a lot more. But
from a climate perspective, because we have to radically expand the
amount of electricity supply and decarbonize transportation and heating
and industry and make hydrogen and do all these other things, that are
going to require electricity to be relatively competitive against the
fossil fuels that they’re trying to displace in those sectors.

<h1>
Oddµ beta program for Campaign Wiki
</h1>
<p>
Campaign Wiki offers a basic wiki for people wanting to keep campaign
records for their role-playing games. I’ve been developing a new
software that’s now
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/view/index">available for beta
testing</a>. That is to say: I think it’s ready. I’ve been using it for
this site for a while, now.
</p>
<p>
What hasn’t been tested is 1. its usability (how well can it be used by
people that are mainly interested in their games and not their software)
and 2. it’s permission setup (the new site no longer allows editing by
strangers: you need an account to edit the site).
</p>
<p>
Well, as soon as the first person signed up, problems started showing up
in both areas! 😅
</p>
<p>
So I’ve been busy fixing bugs and writing documentation.

<p>Possibly the biggest story today in terms of its impact on most
Americans’ lives is that as part of its war on junk fees, the Biden
administration announced an $8 cap on late fees charged by credit card
issuers that have more than a million accounts. These companies hold
more than 95% of outstanding credit card debt. Currently, fees average
$32, and they fall on more than 45 million people. The White House
estimates that late fees currently cost Americans about $25 billion a
year. The rule change will save Americans about $10 billion a year.</p>

<h2 id="us-lawmakers-push-for-bytedance-to-divest-tiktok-or-face-ban">US
Lawmakers Push for ByteDance to Divest TikTok or Face Ban</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers introduced
legislation on Tuesday to give China’s ByteDance about six months to
divest popular short video app TikTok or face a U.S. ban, seeking to
tackle national security concerns about its Chinese ownership.</p>
<p>The bill is the first significant legislative move in nearly a year
toward banning or forcing ByteDance to divest the popular app, after
Senate legislation to ban it stalled in Congress last year in the face
of heavy lobbying by TikTok.</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher, the Republican chairperson of the House of
Representatives’ select China committee and Representative Raja
Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat, are among more than a dozen lawmakers
introducing the measure, which is expected to see an initial vote on
Thursday.</p>
<p>“This is my message to TikTok: break up with the Chinese Communist
Party or lose access to your American users,” Gallagher said. “America’s
foremost adversary has no business controlling a dominant media platform
in the United States.”</p>
<p>The bill would give ByteDance 165 days to divest TikTok, which is
used by more than 170 million Americans, or make it unlawful for app
stores run by Apple, Google, and others to offer TikTok or provide web
hosting services to apps controlled by ByteDance.</p>
<p>The bill would not authorize any enforcement against individual users
of an affected app, however.</p>
<p>“This bill is an outright ban of TikTok, no matter how much the
authors try to disguise it,” a company spokesperson said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“This legislation will trample the First Amendment rights of 170
million Americans and deprive 5 million small businesses of a platform
they rely on to grow and create jobs,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>A White House National Security Council spokesperson called the bill
“an important and welcome step” adding that the Biden administration
would work with Congress “to further strengthen this legislation and put
it on the strongest possible legal footing.”</p>
<p>The administration has worked with lawmakers from both parties to
counter threats of tech services operating in the United States that
pose risks to Americans’ sensitive data and broader national security,
the official added.</p>
<p>TikTok says it has not, and would not, share U.S. user data with the
Chinese government.</p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union called the bill unconstitutional,
saying lawmakers were “once again attempting to trade our First
Amendment rights for cheap political points during an election
year.”</p>
<p>The bill, which would require companion legislation in the Senate,
will be considered at an Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on
Thursday for a vote.</p>
<p>The popularity of the app could make it tough to get legislation
approved in an election year. Last month, Democratic President Joe
Biden’s re-election campaign joined TikTok.</p>
<p>The bill would give the president new powers to designate apps of
concern posing national security risks and subject them to the risk of
bans or curbs unless ownership was divested.</p>
<p>It would cover apps with more than a million annual active users and
under control of a foreign adversary entity, the bill says.</p>
<p>Concerns about Chinese-owned TikTok sparked efforts in Congress last
year to tackle the risks from the short video sharing app or potentially
ban it. Late in 2022, Congress barred federal employees from using it on
government devices.</p>
<p>Last year the administration backed legislation sponsored by Senator
Mark Warner and more than two dozen senators to give it new powers to
ban TikTok and other foreign-based technologies if they pose national
security threats.</p>
<p>That bill has never been voted on.</p>
<p>The new bill aims at bolstering the legal authority to address TikTok
concerns. U.S. courts blocked an effort by previous President Donald
Trump to ban TikTok in 2020.</p>
<p>Late in November, a U.S. judge blocked Montana’s first-of-its kind

Stops Short of Congratulating Indonesia’s Prabowo on Apparent Election
Victory</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>white house — The White House said it looks forward to working with
the incoming Indonesian administration but stopped short of
congratulating Prabowo Subianto on his apparent victory in Indonesia’s
presidential election last month.</p>
<p>“We congratulate the Indonesian people on a successful election. The
president looks forward to early engagement with the new administration
and strengthening our cooperation on what is already a strategic
partnership,” said John Kirby, White House National Security Council
spokesperson, in response to VOA’s question during the White House
briefing Tuesday.</p>
<p>Kirby said the administration is “closely following the ongoing vote
count” that shows Prabowo commanding a significant lead. With almost 90%
of the votes counted, Prabowo holds almost 59% of the more than 150
million votes in the February 14 election.</p>
<p>“We’ve had an excellent cooperation with him since the time he was
defense minister, and if he is in fact finally elected, then we look
forward to continuing that relationship,” Kirby said.</p>
<p>Official results are not due until later in March, but Prabowo has
claimed victory, and several countries have extended their
congratulations, including China, Australia, the United Kingdom and
others.</p>
<p>Alleged human rights violation</p>
<p>Currently serving as Indonesia’s defense minister, Prabowo has a long
track record of alleged human rights violations, including the abduction
and torture of activists during the 1998 ouster of his then
father-in-law, former President Suharto, who ruled Indonesia for 32
years.</p>
<p>Prabowo’s victory is widely attributed to the support of the popular
outgoing president, Joko Widodo, who last week awarded Prabowo with an
honorary four-star general rank. The president’s son, Gibran Rakabuming
Raka, is Prabowo’s running mate, fueling accusations of nepotism.</p>
<p>“Prabowo’s election creates not only a bad precedent in the effort to
prosecute state crimes committed by the previous government,” said
Gufron Mabruri, executive director of Indonesian human rights group
Imparsial. “It will also weaken enforcement of human rights in the
future.”</p>
<p>Until 2020, Prabowo was banned from entering the U.S. due to alleged
human rights violations, but he has since visited as defense minister,
invited by both the Trump and Biden administrations.</p>
<p>Asked about potential democratic backsliding in Indonesia, Kirby said
the administration will “never back away from our concerns about the
need for human rights, civil rights, and all the values of democratic
institutions,” and that President Joe Biden “absolutely will not shy
away” about expressing such concerns.</p>
<p>As the United States and China compete for regional influence,
Prabowo aims to continue Indonesia’s nonaligned foreign policy that has
allowed Jakarta to reap massive investments from Beijing while
maintaining security ties with Washington.</p>
<p>In Washington, concerns about Indonesia veering too close to Beijing
provide a geostrategic backdrop to U.S.-Indonesia ties, said Andreyka
Natalegawa, associate fellow at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies.</p>
<p>“At the same time, these broader geopolitical factors are also just
strengthened by the fact that the U.S.-Indonesia partnership is strong
and solid,” Natalegawa told VOA. He added that given the continuities
with the outgoing Indonesian government, Washington should be
comfortable in working with the new incoming administration.</p>
<p>There have been sporadic protests in Jakarta alleging election
interference, but official results are expected to declare Prabowo as
the country’s next leader in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>I have been a reader of the NYT since I was a small child. I wanted

I was quoted by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Safire">William
Safire</a> in an op-ed. I have done some of the
<a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2002/04/10/newYorkTimesAndUserland.html">most
successful work</a> of my career with the NYT. I love journalism
<a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html">like I love the
Mets</a>. I don’t expect them to do great things every season, but I do
hope for a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_New_York_Mets_season">1969</a>
or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_New_York_Mets_season">1986</a>
every once in a while. These days I don’t have much hope for the NYT
returning to its former glory. I also wonder if they ever really were
that great, that maybe I was just a naive young hero-seeker, growing up
in Queens in the 1960s. We <i>all</i> have to work together to dig out
of the hole we’re in. And that means reporters have to start looking at
themselves, and they have to listen to us, the people who care about the
job that we need journalism to do, that it isn’t doing.</p>

Sudan Activist in US Charged With Trying to Export Arms Illegally for
Coup Back Home</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>phoenix, arizona — A leading South Sudanese academic and activist
living in exile in the United States has been charged in Arizona along
with a Utah man born in the African nation on charges of conspiring to
buy and illegally export millions of dollars’ worth of weapons to
overthrow the government back home. </p>
<p>Peter Biar Ajak fled to the U.S. with the help of the American
government four years ago, after he said South Sudan’s president ordered
him abducted or killed. Emergency visas were issued at the time to Ajak,
now 40, and his family after they spent weeks in hiding in Kenya. He was
most recently living in Maryland. </p>
<p>A federal criminal complaint unsealed Monday in Arizona charges Ajak
and Abraham Chol Keech, 44, of Utah, with conspiring to purchase and
illegally export through a third country to South Sudan a cache of
weapons in violation of the Arms Export Control Act and the Export
Control Reform Act. The weapons that were considered included automatic
rifles like AK-47s, grenade launchers, Stinger missile systems, hand
grenades, sniper rifles, ammunition, and other export-controlled
arms. </p>
<p>Although the criminal complaint was made public by Justice officials,
the case was still not available in the federal government’s online
system by Tuesday afternoon so it was unknown if the men had attorneys
who could speak to the charges against them. </p>
<p>“As alleged, the defendants sought to unlawfully smuggle heavy
weapons and ammunition from the United States into South Sudan — a
country that is subject to a U.N. arms embargo due to the violence
between armed groups, which has killed and displaced thousands,”
Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen of the Justice Department’s
National Security Division said in a statement. </p>
<p>“Sanctions and export controls help ensure that American weapons are
not used internationally to destabilize other sovereign nations,” said
Gary Restaino, U.S. attorney for Arizona. </p>
<p>A man who answered the telephone Tuesday at the Embassy of South
Sudan in Washington said the mission does not have a press officer and
the ambassador was traveling and unavailable for comment. </p>
<p>From 2022-23, Ajak was a postdoctoral fellow in the Belfer Center’s
International Security Program at the Harvard Kennedy School, focusing
on state formation in South Sudan, according to the program’s website.
He has also been a fellow at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies of
the National Defense University and a Reagan-Fascell Democracy Fellow at
the National Endowment for Democracy. </p>
<p>Sudan gained independence from Sudan July 9, 2011, after a successful
referendum. But widespread inter-ethnic violence and extreme human
rights abuses by all sides continue to plague the country.</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
People learn to make art by studying previous artists. Would we want it
any other way?
</p>
<p>
Imagine if everyone had to reinvent everything that anyone had ever
invented just to make something new.
</p>
<p>
There is a lot of that in software, people won’t put in an API so you
have to rebuild the whole house just to get a window.
</p>
<p>
We can make progress when people don’t try to lock up their ideas.
</p>
<p>
Individuals live just a short time, we can’t do that much in a lifetime,
but we are an amazing species, because we leave behind what we learn and
we build.

</p>
<p>
So why shouldn’t our machines be able to learn too? They already can do
things vastly more complex than we can. We’ve invented a huge lever.
</p>
<p>
Science fiction tells us that we will lose control and be enslaved by
our machines. I love those stories, like the Matrix and Battlestar
Galactica. But those are stories, they didn’t happen. The future is
rarely so predictable. Things interact in unforseeable ways.
</p>
<p>
We’re at dead-ends in climate and government. We need to make radical
changes, and a fresh invention as radically progressive as any that has
come before is now in our hands.

<h2 id="metas-facebook-instagram-back-up-after-global-outage">Meta’s
Facebook, Instagram Back Up After Global Outage</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Meta-owned Facebook and Instagram were back up on
Tuesday after a more than two-hour outage that was caused by a technical
issue and impacted hundreds of thousands of users globally.</p>
<p>The disruptions started at around 10:00 a.m. ET (1500 GMT), with many
users saying on rival social media platform X they had been booted out
of Facebook and Instagram and were unable to log in.</p>
<p>“We are aware of the incident and at this time, we are not aware of
any specific malicious cyber activity at this time,” a spokesperson for
the White House National Security Council said.</p>
<p>At the peak of the outage, there were more than 550,000 reports of
disruptions for Facebook and about 92,000 for Instagram, according to
outage tracking website Downdetector.com.</p>
<p>“Earlier today, a technical issue caused people to have difficulty
accessing some of our services. We resolved the issue … for everyone who
was impacted,” Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in a post on X.</p>
<p>Meta Platforms, shares of which were down 1.2% in afternoon trading,
has about 3.19 billion daily active users across its family of apps,
which also include WhatsApp and Threads.</p>
<p>Its status dashboard had earlier showed the application programming
interface for WhatsApp Business was also facing issues.</p>
<p>Though the outage for WhatsApp and Threads was much smaller,
according to Downdetector, which tracks outages by collating status
reports from several sources including users.</p>
<p>Several employees of Meta said on anonymous messaging app Blind that
they were unable to log in to their internal work systems, which left
them wondering if they were laid off, according to posts seen by
Reuters.</p>
<p>The outage was among the top trending topics on X, formerly Twitter,
with the platform’s owner Elon Musk taking a shot at Meta with a post
that said: “If you’re reading this post, it’s because our servers are
working.”</p>
<p>X itself has faced several disruptions to its service after Musk’s
$44 billion purchase of the social media platform in October 2022, with
an outage in December causing issues for more than 77,000 users in
countries from the U.S. to France.</p>

Windows Subsystem for Android</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Well, that was a short run. Announced with much fanfare in 2021,
Microsoft has announced it’s already killing Windows Subsystem for
Android, Microsoft’s solution to run Android applications on Windows 11.
Microsoft is ending support for the Windows Subsystem for Android™️
(WSA). As a result, the Amazon Appstore on Windows and all applications
and games dependent on WSA will no longer be supported beginning March
5, 2025. Until then, technical support will remain available to
customers. Customers that have installed the Amazon Appstore or Android
apps prior to March 5, 2024, will continue to have access to those apps
through the deprecation date of March 5, 2025. Please reach out to our
support team for further questions at support.microsoft.com. We are
grateful for the support of our developer community and remain committed
to listening to feedback as we evolve experiences. ↫ Microsoft’s Learn
website Whenever Microsoft offers a way or an API to run and/or develop
applications for Windows, and it isn’t Win32, you can be certain they’re
going to kill it within a few years.</p>

<p>BTW, in case you’re wondering where “still diggin!” came from –
here’s the deal. I have a feeling that when I develop software it’s a
lot like digging a hole and then starting another, and another and using
the dirt from a new hole to fill in the old holes. At any time there’s
more or less a constant amount of dirt and holes. It seems futile at
first look, and second looks and third looks, but we do eventually get
somewhere, or so we hope, maybe. It’s like “even worse than it appears.”
Still diggin is meant to say we know it’s really futile, you don’t have
to point that out, we never actually go anywhere or do anything, but we
feel somehow that next time it really will work. It’s a Vonnegut-like or
Deadhead-like philosophy, which is also very Postel-like. In other
words, realistic.</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>I owned a C64 and was familiar with the C128, but this one was odd.
It wasn’t running any games, color graphics or playing music. Instead,
it was connected to a monochrome monitor which always displayed either a
weird command line prompt or what seemed to be some boring professional
writing software. I soon came to find that it was running CP/M and
WordStar, one of the first word processors for microcomputers. My daily
obsessive visits to the computer shop led to some friendship with the
owner, to the point that he’d let me in and play with the machines. So,
I played with CP/M and learned how to use WordStar. Well, in case you
didn’t notice, I own a C128DCR now. This blog is about how I got CP/M,
WordStar, and other fun ancient software apps running on it. ↫ Celso
Martinho CP/M, of course, was the primary influence of DOS.</p>

id="facing-reality-whether-its-about-apple-or-the-eu-is-a-core-requirement-for-good-management">Facing
reality, whether it’s about Apple or the EU, is a core requirement for
good management</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Baldur Bjarnason has written an excellent piece to explain why,
exactly, companies like Apple seem wholly incapable of working with the
EU, instead of against it. He argues – quite effectively – that Apple,
and US tech punditry in general, simply do not understand the EU, nor
are they willing to spend even 10 minutes to understand it, which is
really all you need. The core premise of the EU, its very primary
function, is to enable and protect the single market. A great example of
this is the ban on roaming charges – mobile phone carriers in EU are not
allowed to charge extra for using mobile voice and data services in
another EU country. From the EU’s perspective, taking action to prevent
private parties from fragmenting and taking private control over the
single market simultaneously grew the economy and increased consumer
surplus. This is the operating theory behind much of the actions the EU
takes regarding market regulation and product standardisation: a single
market built on standards is more profitable for both businesses and
consumers. ↫ Baldur Bjarnason And because Apple and its tech punditry
refuse to try and understand the party they are dealing with, they get
caught looking like childish idiots every time they open their mouths
about it. Normally when the EU regulates a given sector, it does so with
ample lead time and works with industry to make sure that they
understand their obligations. Apple instead thought that the regulatory
contact from the EU during the lead time to the DMA was an opportunity
for it to lecture the EU on its right to exist. Then its executives made
up some fiction in their own minds as to what the regulation meant,
announced their changes, only to discover later that they were full of
bullshit. This was entirely Apple’s own fault. For months, we’ve been
hearing leaks about Apple’s talks with the EU about the Digital Market
Act. Those talks were not negotiations even though Apple seems to have
thought they were. Talks like those are to help companies implement
incoming regulations, with some leeway for interpretation on the EU’s
side to accommodate business interests. Remember what I wrote about
electrical plugs? The EU is pro-business – often criticised for being
essentially a pro-business entity – and not in favour of regulation for
regulation’s sake. If Apple had faced reality and tried to understand
the facts as they are, they would have used the talks to clarify all of
these issues and more well in advance of the DMA taking effect. But they
didn’t because they have caught the tech industry management disease of
demanding that reality bend to their ideas and wishes. ↫ Baldur
Bjarnason What a lot of people – both inside and outside the EU – do not
grasp is that while we all know the EU has shortcomings and issues, in
general, the EU is uncharacteristically (for a government agency)
popular among EU citizens, no matter the country of origin. That’s
because we, as EU citizens, and especially as EU citizens who do
anything international, know just how ridiculously beneficial the EU has
been for trade, business, the economy, travel, and so much more. Apple
can keep acting like a whiny trust fund boy who thinks the world owes
them everything, but they’ll have to deal with the consequences.
Continued violation of the DMA can lead to fines of up to 10% of
revenue. That’s 38 billion dollars. I secretly hope Apple keeps this
childish behaviour up. It’s deeply entertaining.</p>

Six years ago I wrote
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/03/archival-media-not-good-business.html"><i>Archival
Media: Not a Good Business</i></a> and included this
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5007621">table</a>. The argument went
as follows:<br />
<ul>
<li>
The value that can be extracted from data decays rapidly with time.
</li>
<li>
Thus companies would rather invest in current than archival data.
</li>
<li>
Thus archival media and systems are a niche market.
</li>
<li>
Thus archival media and systems lack the manufacturing volume to drive
down prices.
</li>
<li>
Thus although quasi-immortal media have low opex (running cost), they
have high capex (purchase cost).
</li>
<li>
Especially now interest rates are non-zero, the high capex makes the net
present value of their lifetime cost high.
</li>
<li>
Archival media compete with legacy generic media, which have mass-market
volumes and have already amortized their R&amp;D, so have low capex but
higher opex through their shorter service lives.
</li>
<li>
Because they have much higher volumes and thus much more R&amp;D,
generic media have much higher Kryder rates, meaning that although they
need to be replaced over time, each new unit at approximately equal cost
replaces several old units, reducing opex.
</li>
<li>
Especially now interest rates are non-zero, the net present value of the
lower capex but higher opex is likely very competitive.
</li>
</ul>
Below the fold I look into why, despite this, Microsoft has been pouring
money into archival system R&amp;D for about a decade.<br />

<h3>
Background
</h3>
Eleven years ago Facebook announced they were building entire
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2013/02/facebooks-cold-storage.html">data
centers for cold storage</a>. They expected the major reason for reads
accessing this data would be subpoenas. Eighteen months later I was
finally able to report on Kestutis Patiejunas’ talk explaining the
technology and why it made sense in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html"><i>More
on Facebook’s “Cold Storage”</i></a>. They used two different
technologies, the first exploiting legacy generic media in the form of
mostly-powered-down hard drives. Facebook’s
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">design
for this was</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
aimed at limiting the worst-case power draw. It exploits the fact that
this storage is at the bottom of the storage hierarchy and can tolerate
significant access latency. Disks are assigned to groups in equal
numbers. One group of disks is spun up at a time in rotation, so the
worst-case access latency is the time needed to cycle through all the
disk groups. But the worst-case power draw is only that for a single
group of disks and enough compute to handle a single group.<br /> <br />
Why is this important? Because of the synergistic effects knowing the
maximum power draw enables. The power supplies can be much smaller, and
because the access time is not critical, need not be duplicated. Because
Facebook builds entire data centers for cold storage, the data center
needs much less power and cooling. It can be more like cheap warehouse
space than expensive data center space. Aggregating these synergistic
cost savings at data center scale leads to really significant savings.
</blockquote>
Patiejunas figured out that, only at cloud scale, the economics of
archival storage could be made to work by reducing the non-media,
non-system costs. This insight led to the second technology,
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">robots
full of long-lived optical media</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
It has 12 Blu-ray drives for an entire rack of cartridges holding 10,000
100TB Blu-ray disks managed by a robot. When the robot loads a group of
12 fresh Blu-ray disks into the drives, the appropriate amount of data
to fill them is read from the currently active hard disk group and
written to them. This scheduling of the writes allows for effective use
of the limited write capacity of the Blu-ray drives. If the data are
ever read, a specific group has to be loaded into the drives,
interrupting the flow of writes, but this is a rare occurrence. Once all
10,000 disks in a rack have been written, the disks will be loaded for
reads infrequently. Most of the time the entire Petabyte rack will sit
there idle.
</blockquote>
In theory Blu-ray disks have a 50-year life, but this is
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">irrelevant</a>:
<blockquote>
No-one expects the racks to sit in the data center for 50 years, at some
point before then they will be obsoleted by some unknown new, much
denser and more power-efficient cold storage medium
</blockquote>
Eight years ago in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2016/05/the-future-of-storage.html"><i>The
Future Of Storage</i></a> I explained:<br />
<blockquote>
Every few months there is another press release announcing that some
new,
<a href="http://blog.dshr.org/2014/06/more-on-long-lived-media.html">quasi-immortal
medium</a> such as 5D quartz or stone DVDs has solved the problem of
long-term storage. But the problem stays resolutely unsolved. Why is
this? Very long-lived media are inherently more expensive, and are a
niche market, so they lack economies of scale. Seagate could easily make
<a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/news/events/other_meetings/storage09/docs/5-4_Anderson-seagate-v3_archive_study.pdf">disks
with archival life</a>, but they did a study of the market for them, and
discovered that no-one would pay the relatively small additional cost.
The drives currently marketed for “archival” use have a shorter warranty
and a shorter MTBF than the enterprise drives, so they’re not expected
to have long service lives.<br /> <br /> The fundamental problem is that
long-lived media only make sense at very low Kryder rates. Even if the
rate is only 10%/yr, after 10 years you could store the same data in 1/3
the space. Since space in the data center racks or even at Iron Mountain
isn’t free, this is a powerful incentive to move old media out. If you
believe that Kryder rates will get back to 30%/yr, after a decade you
could store 30 times as much data in the same space.
</blockquote>
The key parameter of these archival storage systems isn’t the media
life, it is the write bandwidth needed to keep up with the massive flow
of
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">data
to be archived</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
While a group of disks is spun up, any reads queued up for that group
are performed. But almost all the I/O operations to this design are
writes. Writes are erasure-coded, and the shards all written to
different disks in the same group. In this way, while a group is spun
up, all disks in the group are writing simultaneously providing huge
write bandwidth. When the group is spun down, the disks in the next
group take over, and the high write bandwidth is only briefly
interrupted.
</blockquote>
The lesson Facebook taught a decade ago was that the keys to
cost-effective archival storage were first, massive scale, and second,
high write bandwidth. Microsoft has learned the lesson and has been
working to develop cloud-scale, high write bandwidth systems using two
quasi-immortal media, DNA and silica.<br />

Rob Carlson’s
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage"><i>The Quest for a
DNA Data Drive</i></a> provides a useful overview of the current state
of the art. Alas he starts by using one of my pet hates, the graph
showing an immense gap between the “requirements” for data storage and
the production of storage media. Carlson
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">captions the
graph</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Prior projections for data storage requirements estimated a global need
for about 12 million petabytes of capacity by 2030. The research firm
Gartner recently issued new projections, raising that estimate by 20
million petabytes. The world is not on track to produce enough of
today’s storage technologies to fill that gap.
</blockquote>
<b>&lt;rant&gt;</b> Carlson’s point is to suggest that there is a huge
market for DNA storage. But this ignores economics. There will always be
a “requirement” to store more data than the production of storage media,
because some data is not valuable enough to justify the cost of storing
it. The “gap” could only be filled if media were free. Customers will
buy the storage systems they can afford and prioritize the data in them
according to the value that can be extracted from it.
<b>&lt;/rant&gt;</b>.<br /> <br /> The size of the market for DNA
storage systems depends upon their cost. In 2018’s
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/02/dnas-niche-in-storage-market.html"><i>DNA’s
Niche in the Storage Market</i></a> I imagined myself as the marketing
person for a DNA storage system and posed these challenges:<br />
<blockquote>
Engineers, your challenge is to increase the speed of synthesis by a
factor of a quarter of a trillion, while reducing the cost by a factor
of fifty trillion, in less than 10 years while spending no more than
$24M/yr.<br /> <br /> Finance team, your challenge is to persuade the
company to spend $24M a year for the next 10 years for a product that
can then earn about $216M a year for 10 years.
</blockquote>
Carlson is realistic about the
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">engineering
challenges</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
For a DNA drive to compete with today’s archival tape drives, it must be
able to write about 2 gigabits per second, which at demonstrated DNA
data storage densities is about 2 billion bases per second. To put that
in context, I estimate that the total global market for synthetic DNA
today is no more than about 10 terabases per year, which is the
equivalent of about 300,000 bases per second over a year. The entire DNA
synthesis industry would need to grow by approximately 4 orders of
magnitude just to compete with a single tape drive.
</blockquote>
One of the speed-ups that is needed is
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">chip-based massive
parallelism</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
One of our goals was to build a semiconductor chip to enable
high-density, high-throughput DNA synthesis.
<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abi6714">That
chip</a>, which we completed in 2021, demonstrated that it is possible
to digitally control electrochemical processes in millions of
650-nanometer-diameter wells.
</blockquote>
It was faster, but it’s chemistry had
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">problems</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The main problem is that it employs a volatile, corrosive, and toxic
organic solvent
(<a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Acetonitrile">acetonitrile</a>),
which no engineer wants anywhere near the electronics of a working data
center.<br /> <br /> Moreover, based on a sustainability analysis of a
theoretical DNA data center performed my colleagues at Microsoft, I
conclude that the volume of acetonitrile required for just one large
data center, never mind many large data centers, would become
logistically and economically prohibitive.
</blockquote>
Although it is the industry standard, this isn’t the only way to
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">write
DNA</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Fortunately, there is a different emerging technology for constructing
DNA that does not require such solvents, but instead uses a benign salt
solution. Companies like <a href="https://www.dnascript.com/">DNA
Script</a> and <a href="https://molecularassemblies.com/">Molecular
Assemblies</a> are commercializing automated systems that use enzymes to
synthesize DNA. These techniques are replacing traditional chemical DNA
synthesis for some applications in the biotechnology industry. The
current generation of systems use either simple plumbing or light to
control synthesis reactions. But it’s difficult to envision how they can
be scaled to achieve a high enough throughput to enable a DNA
data-storage device operating at even a fraction of 2 gigabases per
second.
</blockquote>
The Microsft/UW chip is an
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">alternative way to
control enzymatic synthesis</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The University of Washington and Microsoft team, collaborating with the
enzymatic synthesis company Ansa Biotechnologies, recently took the
first step toward this device. Using our high-density chip, we
successfully demonstrated
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.3c00044">electrochemical
control of single-base enzymatic additions</a>.
</blockquote>
The link is to
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.3c00044"><i>Spatially
Selective Electrochemical Cleavage of a Polymerase-Nucleotide
Conjugate</i></a> by Jake A. Smith <i>et al</i>:<br />
<blockquote>
Novel enzymatic methods are poised to become the dominant processes for
de novo synthesis of DNA, promising functional, economic, and
environmental advantages over the longstanding approach of
phosphoramidite synthesis. Before this can occur, however, enzymatic
synthesis methods must be parallelized to enable production of multiple
DNA sequences simultaneously. As a means to this parallelization, we
report a polymerase-nucleotide conjugate that is cleaved using
electrochemical oxidation on a microelectrode array. The developed
conjugate maintains polymerase activity toward surface-bound substrates
with single-base control and detaches from the surface at mild oxidative
voltages, leaving an extendable oligonucleotide behind. Our approach
readies the way for enzymatic DNA synthesis on the scale necessary for
DNA-intensive applications such as DNA data storage or gene synthesis.
</blockquote>
This has, as the article points out, potential for dramatically reducing
the current cost of writing DNA, but it is still many orders of
magnitude away from being competitive with a tape drive. The

In 2009, Hitachi focused on fused silica known for its excellent heat
and water resistance as a recording medium for long-term digital
storage. After proposing the use of computed tomography to read data
recorded with a femtosecond pulse laser, fused silica glass was
confirmed as an effective storage medium. Applying this technology, it
is possible to achieve multi-layer recording by changing the laser’s
focal point to form microscopic regions (dots) with differing refractive
indices. In 2012, a method was developed with Kyoto University to read
the recorded dots in 4 layers using an optical microscope (recording
density equivalent to a CD), and in 2013, 26 layer recording was
achieved (recording density equivalent to a DVD). In order to increase
recording density for practical applications, one means is to increase
the number of recording layers. At the 100-layer level of recording
density equivalent to a Blu-ray disc however issues arose in dot quality
degradation and read errors resulting from crosstalk of data recorded in
other layers.
</blockquote>
But in the last few years Microsoft Research has taken this idea and run
with it, as they report in a 68-author paper at SOSP entitled
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208"><i>Project Silica:
Towards Sustainable Cloud Archival Storage in Glass</i></a>. It is a
fascinating paper that should be read by anyone interest in archival
storage. Like
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/02/dnas-niche-in-storage-market.html">me</a>,
the authors are skeptical of the near-term prospects for
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">DNA storage</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Technologies like DNA storage offer the promise of an extremely dense
media for long-term data storage. However, the high costs and low
throughputs of oligonucleotide synthesis and sequencing continue to
hamper the technology’s feasibility. The total amount of data
demonstrably stored in DNA remains on the order of MBs, and building a
functional storage system that can offer reasonable SLAs underpinned by
DNA is a substantial challenge. Alternative DNA-based technologies like
dNAM attempt to bypass costly sequencing and synthesis steps,
sacrificing density down to densities comparable with magnetic tape.
</blockquote>
Hence their focus on a medium with, in theory, a somewhat lower
volumetric density. From their
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">abstract</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This paper presents Silica: the first cloud storage system for archival
data underpinned by quartz glass, an extremely resilient media that
allows data to be left in situ indefinitely. The hardware and software
of Silica have been co-designed and co-optimized from the media up to
the service level with sustainability as a primary objective. The design
follows a cloud-first, data-driven methodology underpinned by principles
derived from analyzing the archival workload of a large public cloud
service.
</blockquote>
Their analysis of the workload of a tape-based cloud archival storage
system in Section 2
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">shows that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
on average for every MB read there are 47 MBs written, and for every
read operation there are 174 writes. We can see some variation across
months, but writes always dominate by over an order of magnitude.<br />
…<br /> Small files dominate the workload, with 58.7% of the reads for
files of 4 MiB or smaller. However, these reads only contribute 1.2% of
the volume of data read. Files larger than 256 MiB comprise around 85%
of bytes read but less than 2% of total read requests. Additionally,
there is a long tail of request sizes: there is ∼ 10 orders of magnitude
between the smallest and largest requested file sizes.<br /> …<br /> We
observe a variability in the workload within data centers, with up to 7
orders of magnitude difference between the median and the tail, as well
as large variability across different data centers.<br /> …<br /> At the
granularity of a day, the peak daily [ingress] rate is ∼16x higher than
the mean daily rate. As the aggregation time increases beyond 30 days,
the peak over mean ratio decreases significantly down to only ∼2,
indicating that the average write rate is similar across different
30-day windows.<br /> …<br /> To summarize, as expected for archival
storage, the workload is <i>heavily write-dominated</i>. However,
unexpectedly, the IO operations are dominated by <i>small file
accesses</i>.

<blockquote>
A BLOB is a Binary Large OBject. Each type of BLOB contains a single
type of immutable binary content, such as photos, videos, documents,
etc.<br /> …<br /> Figure 3 shows that the rate of I/O requests to BLOBs
drops rapidly through time. The rates for different types of BLOB drop
differently, but all 9 types have dropped by 2 orders of magnitude
within 8 months, and all but 1 (profile photos) have dropped by an order
of magnitude within the first week.<br /> <br /> The vast majority of
Facebook’s BLOBs are warm, as shown in Figure 5 - notice the scale goes
from 80-100%. Thus the vast majority of the BLOBs generate I/O rates at
least 2 orders of magnitude less than recently generated BLOBs.

Note these important differences between Microsoft’s and Facebook’s
storage hierarchies:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Microsoft stores generic data and depends upon user action to migrate it
down the hierarchy to the archive layer, whereas Facebook stores 9
specific types of application data which is migrated automatically based
upon detailed knowledge of the workload for each of the types.
</li>
<li>
Because Facebook can migrate data automatically, it can interpose a warm
layer above the archive layer of the hierarchy, and because it has
detailed knowledge about the behavior of each of the data types it can
make good decision about when to move each type down the hierarchy.
</li>
<li>
Because the warm layer responds to the vast majority of the read
requests and schedules the downward migrations, Facebook’s archive
layer’s IOPS are a steady flow of large writes with very few reads,
making efficient use of the hardware.

Contrast Facebook’s scheduled ingest flow with the bursty ingest rate
shown in Figure 2 of the Silica paper,
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">which finds
that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
At the granularity of a day, the peak daily rate is ∼16x higher than the
mean daily rate.
</blockquote>
Another interesting aspect of the Silica design is that the
technologies, and thus the hardware, used for writing and reading are
completely different. The authors point out the
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">implications for the
design</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
As different technologies are used to read and write, after a platter is
written it must be fully read using the same technology that will be
used to read it subsequently. This happens before a platter is stored in
the library and any staged write data is deleted.<br /> <br /> This
design has an interesting consequence: during the period when user data
is being written into the library, the workload is going to become
<i>read</i>-dominated. Every byte written must be read to be verified,
in addition to the user reads. The read bandwidth has to be provisioned
for peak user read rate, however the read workloads are very bursty, so
read drive utilization is extremely low on average. Thus, the
verification workload simply utilizes what would otherwise be idle read
drives.
</blockquote>
Using separate write and read drives has
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">two
advantages</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This allows independent scaling of read and write throughput.
Additionally, this design allows us to create the first storage system
that offers true <i>air-gap-by-design</i>: the robotics are unable to
insert a glass platter into a write drive once the glass media has been
written.
</blockquote>
Since the majority of reads are for verification, the design needs to
make specific provision for
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">user reads</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
To enable high drive efficiency, two platters can be mounted
simultaneously in a read drive: one undergoing verification, and one
servicing a customer read. Customer traffic is prioritized over
verification, with the read drive switching away when a platter is
mounted for a customer read. As soon as the customer platter stops being
accessed, the read drive has the ability to quickly switch to the other
platter and continue verification. This is similar to avoiding
head-of-line blocking of mice flows by elephant flows in networked
systems.
</blockquote>
Like Facebook’s, the prototype Silica systems are
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">data-center
size</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
A <i>Silica library</i> is a sequence of contiguous write, read, and
storage racks interconnected by a platter delivery system. Along all
racks there are parallel horizontal rails that span the entire library.
We refer to a side of the library (spanning all racks) as a
<i>panel</i>. A set of <i>free roaming</i> robots called <i>shuttles</i>
are used to move platters between locations.<br /> …<br /> A read rack
contains multiple read drives. Each read drive is independent and has
slots into which platters are inserted and removed. The number of
shuttles active on a panel is limited to twice the number of read drives
in the panel. The write drive is full-rack-sized and writes multiple
platters concurrently.
</blockquote>
Their performance evaluation focuses on the ability to respond to read
requests within 15 hours. Their cost evaluation, like Facebook’s,
focuses on the savings from using warehouse-type space to house the
equipment, although is isn’t clear that they have actually done so. The
rest of their cost evaluation is somewhat hand-wavy, as is natural for a
system that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">isn’t yet
in production</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The Silica read drives use polarization microscopy, which is a
commoditized technique widely used in many applications and is low-cost.
Currently, system cost in Silica is dominated by the write drives, as
they use femtosecond lasers which are currently expensive and used in
niche applications. This highlights the importance of resource
proportionality in the system, as write drive utilization needs to be
maximized in order to minimize costs. As the Silica technology
proliferates, it will drive up the demand for femtosecond lasers,
commoditizing the technology.
</blockquote>
I’m skeptical of this last point. Archival systems are a niche in the IT
market, and one on which companies are loath to spend money, The only
customers for systems like Silica are the large cloud providers, who
will be reluctant to commit their archives to technology owned by a
competitor. Unless a mass-market application for femtosecond lasers
emerges, the scope for cost reduction is limited.<br />

it isn’t predicted to ship as many bits as hard disks for another four

touchscreens is an industry-wide problem, with almost every

drivers to take their eyes off the road and raising the risk of
distraction crashes,” said Matthew Avery, Euro NCAP’s director of
strategic development. “New Euro NCAP tests due in 2026 will encourage
manufacturers to use separate, physical controls for basic functions in
an intuitive manner, limiting eyes-off-road time and therefore promoting
safer driving,” he said. ↫ Jonathan M. Gitlin at Ars Technica Excellent

<h2 id="why-are-there-so-many-methane-satellites">Why Are There So Many
Methane Satellites?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTQ3MTg1NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NTM0ODYxM30.UBPNBLWGUZId7rH3kzmGRfufyZCFqMpTCed9ISu7NQY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
On Monday afternoon, a satellite the size of a washing machine hitched a
ride on a SpaceX rocket and was launched into orbit. MethaneSAT, as the
new satellite is called, is the latest to join more than a dozen other
instruments currently circling the Earth monitoring emissions of the
ultra-powerful greenhouse gas methane. But it won’t be the last. Over
the next several months, at least two additional methane-detecting
satellites from the U.S. and Japan are scheduled to join the fleet.
</p>
<p>
There’s a joke among scientists that there are so many methane-detecting
satellites in space that they are reducing global warming — not just by
providing essential data about emissions, but by blocking radiation from
the sun.
</p>
<p>
So why do we keep launching more?
</p>
<p>
Despite the small army of probes in orbit, and an increasingly large
fleet of methane-detecting planes and drones closer to the ground, our
ability to identify where methane is leaking into the atmosphere is
still far too limited. Like carbon dioxide, sources of methane around
the world are numerous and diffuse. They can be natural, like wetlands
and oceans, or man-made, like decomposing manure on farms, rotting waste
in landfills, and leaks from oil and gas operations.
</p>
<p>
There are big, unanswered questions about methane, about which sources
are driving the most emissions, and consequently, about tackling climate
change, that scientists say MethaneSAT will help solve. But even then,
some say we’ll need to launch even more instruments into space to really
get to the bottom of it all.
</p>
<p>
Measuring methane from space only began in 2009 with the launch of the
Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite, or GOSAT, by Japan’s Aerospace
Exploration Agency. Previously, most of the world’s methane detectors
were on the ground in North America. GOSAT enabled scientists to develop
a more geographically diverse understanding of major sources of methane
to the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
Soon after, the Environmental Defense Fund, which led the development of
MethaneSAT, began campaigning for better data on methane emissions.
Through its own, on-the-ground measurements,
<a href="https://www.edf.org/climate-impacts-methane-emissions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
group discovered</a> that the Environmental Protection Agency’s
estimates of leaks from U.S. oil and gas operations were totally off.
EDF took this as a call to action. Because methane has such a strong
warming effect, but also breaks down after about a decade in the
atmosphere, curbing methane emissions can slow warming in the near-term.
</p>
<p>
“Some call it the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop28-methane-limits-warming" target="_blank">low
hanging fruit</a>,” Steven Hamburg, the chief scientist at EDF leading
the MethaneSAT project, said during a press conference on Friday. “I
like to call it the fruit lying on the ground. We can really reduce
those emissions and we can do it rapidly and see the benefits.”
</p>
<p>
But in order to do that, we need a much better picture than what GOSAT
or other satellites like it can provide.
</p>
<p>
In the years since GOSAT launched, the field of methane monitoring has
exploded. Today, there are two broad categories of methane instruments
in space. Area flux mappers, like GOSAT, take global snapshots. They can
show where methane concentrations are generally higher, and even
identify exceptionally large leaks — so-called
<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj4351" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“ultra-emitters.”</a>
But the vast majority of leaks, big and small, are invisible to these
instruments. Each pixel in a GOSAT image is 10 kilometers wide. Most of
the time, there’s no way to zoom into the picture and see which
facilities are responsible.

Point source imagers, on the other hand, take much smaller photos that
have much finer resolution, with pixel sizes down to just a few meters
wide. That means they provide geographically limited data — they have to
be programmed to aim their lenses at very specific targets. But within
each image is much more actionable data.
</p>
<p>
For example, GHGSat, a private company based in Canada, operates a
constellation of 12 point-source satellites, each one about the size of
a microwave oven. Oil and gas companies and government agencies pay
GHGSat to help them identify facilities that are leaking. Jean-Francois
Gauthier, the director of business development at GHGSat, told me that
each image taken by one of their satellites is 12 kilometers wide, but
the resolution for each pixel is 25 meters. A snapshot of the Permian
Basin, a major oil and gas producing region in Texas, might contain
hundreds of oil and gas wells, owned by a multitude of companies, but
GHGSat can tell them apart and assign responsibility.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll see five, 10, 15, 20 different sites emitting at the same time
and you can differentiate between them,” said Gauthier. “You can see
them very distinctly on the map and be able to say, alright, that’s an
unlit flare, and you can tell which company it is, too.” Similarly,
GHGSat can look at a sprawling petrochemical complex and identify the
exact tank or pipe that has sprung a leak.
</p>
<p>
But between this extremely wide-angle lens, and the many finely-tuned
instruments pointing at specific targets, there’s a gap. “It might seem
like there’s a lot of instruments in space, but we don’t have the kind
of coverage that we need yet, believe it or not,” Andrew Thorpe, a
research technologist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory told me. He
has been working with the nonprofit Carbon Mapper on a new constellation
of point source imagers, the first of which is supposed to launch later
this year.
</p>
<p>
The reason why we don’t have enough coverage has to do with the size of
the existing images, their resolution, and the amount of time it takes
to get them. One of the challenges, Thorpe said, is that it’s very hard
to get a continuous picture of any given leak. Oil and gas equipment can
spring leaks at random. They can leak continuously or intermittently. If
you’re just getting a snapshot every few weeks, you may not be able to
tell how long a leak lasted, or you might miss a short but significant
plume. Meanwhile, oil and gas fields are also changing on a weekly
basis, Joost de Gouw, an atmospheric chemist at the University of
Colorado, Boulder, told me. New wells are being drilled in new places —
places those point-source imagers may not be looking at.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a lot of potential to miss emissions because we’re not
looking,” he said. “If you combine that with clouds — clouds can obscure
a lot of our observations — there are still going to be a lot of times
when we’re not actually seeing the methane emissions.”
</p>
<p>
De Gouw hopes MethaneSAT will help resolve one of the big debates about
methane leaks. Between the millions of sites that release small amounts
of methane all the time, and the handful of sites that exhale massive
plumes infrequently, which is worse? What fraction of the total do those
bigger emitters represent?
</p>
<p>
Paul Palmer, a professor at the University of Edinburgh who studies the
Earth’s atmospheric composition, is hopeful that it will help pull
together a more comprehensive picture of what’s driving changes in the
atmosphere. Around the turn of the century, methane levels pretty much
leveled off, he said. But then, around 2007, they started to grow again,
and have since accelerated. Scientists have reached different
conclusions about why.
</p>
<p>
“There’s lots of controversy about what the big drivers are,” Palmer
told me. Some think it’s related to oil and gas production increasing.
Others — and he’s in this camp — think it’s related to warming wetlands.
“Anything that helps us would be great.”
</p>
<p>
MethaneSAT sits somewhere between the global mappers and point source
imagers. It will take larger images than GHGSat, each one 200 kilometers
wide, which means it will be able to cover more ground in a single day.
Those images will also contain finer detail about leaks than GOSAT, but
they won’t necessarily be able to identify exactly which facilities the
smaller leaks are coming from. Also, unlike with GHGSat, MethaneSAT’s
data will be freely available to the public.
</p>
<p>
EDF, which raised $88 million for the project and spent nearly a decade
working on it, says that one of MethaneSAT’s main strengths will be to
provide much more accurate basin-level emissions estimates. That means
it will enable researchers to track the emissions of the entire Permian
Basin over time, and compare it with other oil and gas fields in the
U.S. and abroad. Many countries and companies are
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop28-methane-limits-warming" target="_self">making
pledges to reduce their emissions</a>, and MethaneSAT will provide data
on a relevant scale that can help track progress, Maryann Sargent, a
senior project scientist at Harvard University who has been working with
EDF on MethaneSAT, told me.

<p>
It could also help the Environmental Protection Agency understand
whether its
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/biden-epa-methane-rules" target="_self">new
methane regulations</a> are working. It could help with the
<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_5776" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">development
of new standards</a> for natural gas being imported into Europe. At the
very least, it will help oil and gas buyers differentiate between
products associated with higher or lower methane intensities. It will
also enable fossil fuel companies who measure their own methane
emissions to compare their performance to regional averages.
</p>
<p>
MethaneSAT won’t be able to look at every source of methane emissions
around the world. The project is limited by how much data it can send
back to Earth, so it has to be strategic. Sargent said they are limiting
data collection to 30 targets per day, and in the near term, those will
mostly be oil and gas producing regions. They aim to map emissions from
80% of global oil and gas production in the first year. The outcome
could be revolutionary.
</p>
<p>
“We can look at the entire sector with high precision and track those
emissions, quantify them and track them over time. That’s a first for
empirical data for any sector, for any greenhouse gas, full stop,”
Hamburg told reporters on Friday.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>But this still won’t be enough, said Thorpe of NASA. He
wants to see the next generation of instruments start to look more
closely at natural sources of emissions, like wetlands. “These types of
emissions are really, really important and very poorly understood,” he
said. So I think there’s a heck of a lot of potential to work towards
the sectors that have been really hard to do with current technologies.”

<p class="drop-caps">
The Department of Treasury
<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1379" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published</a>
<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2023-06822/section-30d-new-clean-vehicle-credit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new
rules</a> last year that will determine which new electric vehicles,
purchased for personal use, will qualify for
<a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/credits-for-new-clean-vehicles-purchased-in-2023-or-after" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
$7,500 tax credit</a>. They went into effect on April 18, 2023, and last
for the next decade or so.
</p>
<p>
These new tax credit rules are complicated. The list of cars that
qualify for the new tax credit can change from year to year — and even
month to month. Many buyers in the EV market might have a few questions,
including: Should I buy that new car now, or should I wait? Which cars
qualify for the current tax credit, and which ones will earn the new
one?
</p>
<p>
This is Heatmap’s guide to the new tax credit, why it matters, and what
to keep in mind as you go EV shopping.
</p>
<h3>
Who is affected by these new rules?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
If you’re an ordinary American buying a brand-new EV to run errands and
pick up the kids, these new rules apply to you. They will determine
which cars you can get a federally funded discount on.
</p>
<p>
If you’re not buying a <em>new</em> car for <em>personal</em> use —
because you’re getting it for your business, say, or because you’re
buying a used EV — these new rules don’t apply to you. But you may
qualify for other new subsidies. We get into those below.
</p>
<p>
And even if you <em>are </em>in that first category, you may discover
it’s much cheaper to lease a new EV instead of buying it outright. We
get into why below, too.
</p>
<h3>
Why are these new rules important?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
They completely change how the United States approaches the EV industry.
</p>
<p>
During the Bush and Obama administrations, the U.S. was focused mostly
on getting automakers to begin to experiment with EVs. So it discounted
<a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409#vehicles-purchased-before-august-17-2022" target="_blank">the
first 200,000 or so electric vehicles</a> that each manufacturer sold by
up to $7,500. If a company had cumulatively sold more than that number
over time, as Tesla and General Motors eventually did, then the discount
expired. By 2022, that had led to a peculiar situation where foreign
automakers, such as Hyundai, could use the subsidy, while some of the
largest American automakers couldn’t.
</p>
<p>
Now, U.S. policy is focused on two goals: (1) building up a domestic
supply chain for EVs and (2) getting more EVs on the road. So the tax
break is completely uncapped — any automaker can use it as many times as
possible if they meet the criteria.
</p>
<p>
But many new requirements apply: Only cars that undergo final assembly
in North America will qualify for <em>any </em>of the tax credit. Then,
cars with a battery that was more than 50% made in North America will
qualify for a $3,750 subsidy. And cars where at least 40% of the
“critical minerals” used come from the U.S. or a country with whom we
have a free-trade agreement will qualify for another $3,750 subsidy.
</p>
<p>
Those percentage-based requirements will ramp up over time. By 2029, for
instance, 100% of a car’s battery and battery components must be made in
North America.
</p>
<h3>
Why is this change happening now?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Because Congress said so. The Inflation Reduction Act, which Democratic
majorities in the House and Senate passed last year, mandated this
change to the EV tax credit as part of its broad expansion of American
climate policy.<span></span><br/>
</p>
<h3>
Will more EVs or fewer EVs qualify for a subsidy under those new rules?
</h3>
<br>
<p>
Initially, fewer EVs will receive a subsidy under the new rules, Biden
officials say. On a press call with reporters, a senior Treasury
official argued that more cars will eventually qualify under the new
rules than qualified under the old ones.
</p>
<h3>
Which EVs will qualify under the new rules in 2024?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
This year, at least 15 car or light trucks will receive some or all of
the credit. Only some of those vehicles will qualify for the full $7,500
tax credit; some will qualify for a partial $3,750 tax credit. Here is
the full list of qualifying models, along with the amount of the tax
credit that they will earn:
</p>
<p>
• Audi Q5 TFSI e Quattro PHEV ($3,750)<br/> • Cadillac LYRIQ ($7,500) •
Chevrolet Bolt ($7,500)<br/> • Chevrolet Bolt EUV ($7,500)<br/> •
Chrysler Pacifica PHEV ($7,500)<br/> • Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid
($3,750)<br/> • Ford F-150 Lightning, Standard &amp; Extended Range
($7,500)<br/> • Jeep Wrangler PHEV 4xe ($3,750)<br/> • Jeep Grand
Cherokee PHEV 4xe ($3,750)<br/> • Lincoln Corsair Grand Touring
($3,750)<br/> • Rivian R1S, Dual Large &amp; Quad Large ($3,750)<br/> •
Rivian R1T, Dual Large, Dual Max, &amp; Quad Large ($3,750)<br/> • Tesla
Model X Long Range ($7,500)<br/> • Tesla Model 3 Performance
($7,500)<br/> • Tesla Model 3 Long Range AWD ($3,500)<br/> • Tesla Model
Y AWD, Rear-Wheel Drive, &amp; Performance ($7,500)<br/> • Volkswagen
ID.4 AWD PRO, PRO, S, &amp; Standard ($7,500)<br/>
</p>
<p>
Some vehicles that earned the full tax credit in 2023, such as the Ford
Mustang Mach E, don’t qualify for any benefit as of January 2, 2024.
</p>
<h3>
Are there any EVs that definitely do not qualify for either tax credit?
</h3>
<br>
<p>
Yes. A few examples: The Hummer EV, which costs more than $110,000 a
piece, won’t qualify for either the new or old tax credit — it’s too
expensive. And the Polestar 2 won’t qualify because it’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/americans-are-willing-to-pay-more-to-reject-chinese-evs?draft=1" target="_self">assembled
in China</a>.
</p>
<h3>
Have there been any other recent changes to the EV tax credit? 
</h3>
<br>
<p>
Yes. Starting this year, the U.S. is preventing cars
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-tax-credit-china-rule-2024" target="_blank">that
receive too much manufacturing input</a> from a “foreign entity of
concern” — that is, China — from qualifying for <em></em>any<em> </em>of
the tax credit. This has reduced the number of vehicles that qualify for
the $7,500 bonus.
</p>
<p>
This year, the government will also allow buyers
<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/EV-Tax-Credit-FAQs.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to
refund their EV tax credit at the dealership</a>. That means buyers can
now get up to a $7,500 discount at the moment when they buy their car
instead of waiting until they file their taxes in the following year.
</p>
<h3>
Are there any income caps on the $7,500 tax credit?
</h3>
<br>
<p>
Yes. A married couple must have an adjusted gross income of less than
$300,000 a year, and a single filer must have an AGI of less than
$150,000 a year, to qualify for any aspect of the subsidy. A
head-of-household must have an income of less than $225,000 a year.
</p>
<h3>
Lots of rules! Is there a price limit on the EVs that can qualify for
this new subsidy?
</h3>
<br>
<p>
Yes. Under the proposed rule, cars must have an MSRP below $55,000 to
qualify for the credit. Vans, pickup trucks, and SUVs must have an MSRP
below $80,000.
</p>
<h3>
If my household makes more than that, do I have any other options?
</h3>
<br>
<p>
Yes. The Inflation Reduction Act also included a new $7,500 tax credit
for EVs used for any commercial purpose. The Treasury Department is
<em>expected </em>to interpret that provision to cover leasing, but it
hasn’t announced the guidelines for that rule yet, so we don’t know for
sure.
</p>
<p>
But the provision will probably tilt new EV drivers toward leasing their
car rather than buying it outright, because the dealer should — emphasis
on <em>should —</em> offer relative discounts on leasing vehicles as
compared to buying them.
</p>
<h3>
There’s no way I can afford a new EV. Does the IRA contain any subsidies
for buying a used EV?
</h3>
<br>
<p>
Yes. There’s also
<a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/used-clean-vehicle-credit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
new $4,000 tax credit</a> for buying a used EV that costs $25,000 or
less. It went into effect on January 1, 2023, so you can go ahead and
use it today.
</p>
<p>
But note that it has even stricter income limits: Married couples can
only take advantage of it if they make $150,000 or less, and other
filers if they make $75,000 or less.
</p>
<h3>
Out of the curiosity, what models qualified for the $7,500 credit before
April 18?
</h3>
<br>
<p>
Here’s the list of cars that qualified for the $7,500 tax credit before
April 18, 2023,
<a href="https://fueleconomy.gov/feg/tax2023.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according

car was made. Check the VIN or ask the dealership to confirm it was made
in North America before buying.

You can’t shop your way out of a monopoly (05 Mar 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links You can’t shop your way out of a monopoly: Any election
where you vote with your wallet will be won by the people with the
thickest wallets. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in
history: 2009, 2014, 2019 Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent
appearances: Podcasts, events and more. Latest books: You keep readin’
em, I’ll keep writin’ ‘em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I’ll keep
writin’ ‘em. Colophon: All the rest. You can’t shop your way out of a
monopoly (permalink) If you’re running a business, you can either invest
at being good at your business, or good at Google SEO. Choose the former
and your customers will love you – but they won’t be able to find you,
thanks to the people who choose the latter. And if you’re going to
invest in top-notch SEO, why bother investing in quality at all? For
more than a decade, Google has promised that it would do something about
“lead gens” – services that spoof Google into thinking that they are
local businesses, pushing down legit firms on both regular search and
Google Maps (these downranked businesses invested in quality, not SEO,
remember). Search for a roofer, a plumber, an electrician, or a
locksmith (especially a locksmith), and most or all of the results will
be lead-gens. They’ll take your call, pretend to be a local business,
and then call up some half-qualified bozo to come out and charge you
four times the going rate for substandard work:
https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/business/fake-online-locksmiths-may-be-out-to-pick-your-pocket-too.html
Some of them just take your money and they “go back to the shop for a
tool” and never return:
https://www.riverfronttimes.com/news/when-a-fake-business-used-a-real-st-louis-address-things-got-weird-32087998
Google has been promising to fix this since the late aughts, and to be
fair, it’s a little better. There was once a time when a map of
Manhattan showed more locksmiths than taxis:
https://blumenthals.com/blog/2009/02/18/google-maps-proves-more-locksmiths-in-nyc-than-cabs/
But GMaps is trapped in the enshittification squeeze. On the one hand,
the company wants to provide a good and reliable map. On the other hand,
the company makes money selling “ads” that are actually payola, where a
business can pay to get to the top of the listings or get displayed on
the map itself. Zoom out of Google’s map of central London and the
highlighted landmarks are a hilarious mix of “organic” and paid
listings: the British Museum, Buckingham Palace, the Barbican, the
London Eye…and a random oral and maxillofacial clinic in the financial
district: https://twitter.com/dylanbeattie/status/1764711667663831455
Hell of a job “organizing the world’s information and making it
universally accessible and useful,” Big G. Doubtless the average
Londoner finds the presence of this clinic super helpful in orienting
themselves relative to the map on their phone screens, and it’s a real
service to tourists hoping to hit all the major landmarks. It’s not just
Maps users who’d noticed the rampant enshittification. Even the original
design team is so horrified they’re moved to speak out about the moral
injury they experience seeing the product they worked so hard on turned
into a giant pile of shit:
https://twitter.com/elizlaraki/status/1727351922254852182 Now, when it
comes to locksmiths, I’m lucky. My neighborhood in Burbank includes the
wonderful Golden State Lock and Safe, which has been in business since
1942: https://www.goldenstatelock.com/ But you wouldn’t know it from
searching GMaps for a locksmith near me. That search turns up a long
list of scams: https://www.google.com/maps/search/locksmith/<span
class="citation"
data-cites="34.1750451">@34.1750451</span>,-118.369948,14z/data=!3m1!4b1?entry=ttu
It also turns up plenty of Keyme machines – these are private-equity
backed, self-serve key-cutting machines placed in grocery stores.
Despite Keyme calling itself a “locksmith,” it’s just a badly secured,
overcaptilized, enshittification-bound system for collecting and
retaining shapefiles for the keys to millions of homes, cross-referenced
with billing information that will make it easy for the eventual hackers
to mass-produce keys for all those poor suckers’ houses. (Hilariously,
Keyme claims to be an “AI” company):
https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200114005194/en/KeyMe-Raises-35-Million-to-Further-Its-Mission-of-Building-the-Premier-Locksmith-Services-Company-in-the-Nation
But despite the fact that you can literally see the Golden State
storefront from Google Streetview, Google Maps claims to have no
knowledge of it. Instead, Streetview labels Golden State “Keyme” – and
displays a preview showing a locksmith using a tool to break into a jeep
(I’d dearly love to know how the gadget next to the Slurpee machine at
the 7-Eleven will drive itself to your jeep and unlock the door for you
when you lose your keys):

It’s pretty clear to me what’s going on here. Keyme has hired some SEO
creeps and/or paid off Google, flooding the zone with listings for its
machines. Meanwhile, Golden State, being merely good at locksmithing,
has lost the SEO wars. Perhaps Golden State could shift some of its
emphasis from being good at locksmithing in order to get better at SEO,
but this is a race that will always be won by the firm that puts the
most into SEO, which will always be the firm that puts the least into
quality. Whenever I write about this stuff, people inevitably ask me
which search engine they should use, if not Google? And there’s the rub.
Google used predatory pricing and anticompetitive mergers to acquire a
90% search market-share. The company spends more than $26b/year buying
default position in every place where you might possibly encounter a new
search engine. This created the “kill zone” – the VC’s term of art for
businesses that no one will invest in, because Google makes sure that no
one will ever find out it exists:
https://www.theverge.com/23802382/search-engine-google-neeva-android
That’s why the only serious competitor to Google is Bing, another Big
Tech company (Bing is also the primary source of results on Duckduckgo,
which is why DDG sometimes makes exceptions for Microsoft’s
privacy-invading tracking):
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDuckGo#Controversies Google tells us
that the quid-pro-quo of search monopolization is search excellence. The
hundreds of billions it makes every year through monopoly control gives
it the resources it needs to fight spammers and maintain search result
quality. Anyone who’s paid attention recently knows that this is
bullshit: Google search quality is in free-fall, across all its
products:
https://downloads.webis.de/publications/papers/bevendorff_2024a.pdf But
Google doesn’t seem to think it has a problem. Rather than devoting all
its available resources to fighting botshit, spam and scams, the company
set $80 billion dollars alight last year with a stock buyback that was
swiftly followed with 12,000 layoffs, followed by multiple subsequent
rounds of layoffs:
https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/21/im-feeling-unlucky/#not-up-to-the-task
The scams that slip through Google’s cracks are sometimes nefarious, but
just as often they’re decidedly amateurish, the kind of thing that
Google could fix by throwing money at the problem, say, to validate that
new ads for confirmed Google merchants come from the merchant’s
registered email addresses and go to the merchant’s registered website:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/24/passive-income/#swiss-cheese-security
Search is a capital intensive business, and there are real returns to
scale, as the UK Competition and Market Authority’s excellent 2020 study
describes:
https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5fe4957c8fa8f56aeff87c12/Appendix_I_-<em>search_quality_v.3_WEB</em>.pdf
But Google doesn’t seem to think that its search needs that $80 billion
to fight the spamwars. That’s the thing about monopolists, they get
complacent. As Lily Tomlin’s “Ernestine the AT&amp;T operator” used to
say, “We don’t care, we don’t have to, we’re the phone company.” That’s
why I’m so excited about the DOJ Antitrust Division monopolization case
against Google. Trusting one company to “organize the world’s
information and make it universally accessible and useful,” was a
failure:
https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-google-monopolizing-digital-advertising-technologies
I understand why people want to know which search engine they should use
instead of Google, and I get why, “There aren’t any good search engines”
is such an unsatisfactory answer. I understand why each fresh round of
printer-company fuckery prompts people to ask “which printer should I
get?” and I understand why “There are only six major printer companies
and they’re all suffering from end-stage enshittification” isn’t what
anyone wants to hear. We want to be able to vote with our wallets,
because it’s so much faster and more convenient than voting with our
ballots. But the vote-with-your-wallet election is rigged for the people
with the thickest wallets. Try as hard as you’d like, you just can’t
shop your way out of a monopoly – that’s like trying to recycle your way
out of the climate emergency. Systemic problems need systemic solutions
– not individual ones. That’s why the new antitrust matters so much. The
answer to monopolies is to break up companies, block and unwind mergers,
ban deceptive and unfair conduct. “Caveat emptor” is the scammer’s
motto. You shouldn’t have to be an expert on lead gen scams to hire a
locksmith without getting ripped off. There are good products and
services out there. Earlier this year, we decided to install a
(non-networked) programmable pushbutton lock. I asked Deviant Ollam –
whom I know from Defcon’s Lockpicking Village – for a recommendation and
he suggested the Schlage FE595:
https://www.schlage.com/en/home/products/FE595PLYFFFFLA.html I liked it
so much I bought another one for my office door. Eric from Golden State
Lock and Safe installed it while I wrote this blog-post. It’s great. I
recommend both of ‘em – 10/10, would do business again. (Image: alicia

<h2 id="its-time-to-give-up-on-everything-but-email">It’s Time to Give
Up on Everything but Email</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I was sitting there, minding my own damn business, surfing the web, clicking around, enjoying my time, when I stumbled on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/03/email-nightmare-just-give-up/677615/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, by Ian Bogost on The Atlantic, that is so painfully stupid that I had to take the time and comment on it. Because, as you know, I love emails.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
Finally, in step five, you must evangelize your mission. Email is a
public-health concern. Gently correct your mother when she tries to
correspond. Reprimand your email-happy colleagues. Punish email abuse by
withholding your replies. Or, more gently, darken someone’s doorway. In
short, you must show the sort of leadership that will encourage others
to forsake their email too. We’ll never stop the rain of email, no
matter what we do. But if we work together, maybe we can build a kind of
shelter.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The entire premise of this article is that email is an unmanageable mess
filled with all sorts of garbage and dealing with it is a lost cause.
There’s an analogy in there that is so idiotic that is worth quoting:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Alas, there is no opting out from email. As a practical matter, your
inbox cannot be abandoned altogether. The same is true for postal mail:
To function within the normal bounds of contemporary society, you must
be addressable in physical space. You must be able to receive Amex bills
and Amazon baubles, and also, you must subject yourself to lots of junk.
This analogy between your home’s mailbox and your computer’s inbox is so
easily made that it’s often overlooked. Both are stuffed with garbage by
default, but also just a few essential messages.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Ian, let me give you some shocking advice: unlike your physical address,
it’s not hard to get an extra email address. Hell, you can get even more
than one. You can go one step further and get a disposable one!
Shocking, I know!
</p>
<p>
In all seriousness, if in 2024 you’re using one single email address for
everything that’s a you problem, not an email problem. Also, Ian, let me
ask you a question: what’s the alternative here? Do we all move to
Slack/Discord/Teams? Do we all move everything to DMs? Do you think
that’s a better solution?
</p>
<p>
There’s a reason why emails are still here. They’re still here because
they work. Is email perfect? No. Is there a better alternative? Also no.

$650 million for a data center that runs on nuclear power. Talen
Energy’s Cumulus data center campus in Pennsylvania gets power from the
Susquehanna nuclear plant, one of the largest nuclear power plants in
the U.S. It will give Amazon a supply of clean carbon-free power, which
the company could use to run energy-intensive artificial intelligence
operations. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e6d3a8bdc1&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">reported</a>
that AI searches require 10 times more computing power than regular
searches. Amazon’s new data center campus could give it a leg-up over
other tech giants because “companies looking to start data centers
running AI face delays in getting permits to connect to grids, and long
waits for the installation of transmission lines to connect utilities to
their facilities.”

<h3>
<span></span>2. E-bike accidents account for majority of NYC cycling
deaths
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Thirty cyclists died in New York City last year, the
highest number since 1999, <em>The New York Times</em>
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e471cdcc85&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">reported</a>,
citing Department of Transportation data. Twenty-three of those killed
were riding electric bikes, and most of them collided with vehicles in
areas lacking proper cycling infrastructure. However the <em>Times</em>
notes that a good portion (about one-third) of the e-bike riders who
died were in solo crashes – accidents that did not involve cars or
pedestrians, a trend that isn’t seen among traditional bike-riders.
“There may be a learning curve that some first-time e-bike riders aren’t
prepared for,” said Sara Lind, an executive director at Open Plans.
“It’s very possible that that learning curve, combined with the speed of
the bike, exacerbates already confusing or chaotic conditions.
Navigating a pothole or a suddenly blocked bike lane is more dangerous
at a higher speed, emphasizing even more the need for better
infrastructure as more people use e-bikes.” Some e-bikes can reach
speeds of 25 mph, though NYC is reducing the top speeds of electric Citi
Bikes to 18 mph.

<li>NOAA warns of mass coral bleaching event
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>The world is on the cusp of the worst mass coral
bleaching event in the history of the planet, the U.S. National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=89b328527f&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">warned</a>.
Climate change and El Niño have sent ocean temperatures soaring, and
already “the Southern Hemisphere is basically bleaching all over the
place,” ecologist Derek Manzello, the coordinator of NOAA’s Coral Reef
Watch, told <em>Reuters</em>. “The entirety of the Great Barrier Reef is
bleaching. We just had reports that American Samoa is bleaching.”
Researchers believe a sustained global temperature increase of 1.5
degrees Celsius is a tipping point for mass coral reef die-off. Coral
reef ecosystems provide a home to thousands of species of fish and other
plants and animals, and are essential sources of food and income for
millions of people around the world. NOAA
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=6d30066377&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notes</a>

bleaching event, but they are under more stress and are subject to
mortality.”

the firm said it expects battery prices to drop by 40% between 2023 and
2025, resulting in “breakthrough levels” of cost parity with internal
combustion engine cars in some markets. By 2030, Goldman sees EVs
accounting for 50% of U.S. car sales. Looking ahead, Nikhil Bhandari,
co-head of Asia-Pacific Natural Resources and Clean Energy Research,
said major innovations like solid-state batteries could “be a
game-changer for the industry.” Batteries can account for one-third of
the cost of an EV.

HFCs represent around 2% of total greenhouse gases, but “their impact on
global warming can be hundreds to thousands of times greater than that
of carbon dioxide (CO2) per unit of mass.” The EPA is

regular reader of this blog will know how totally I agree with this. But
oddly when I agreed with her, perhaps a little to strongly for her

<p>
If you’re wondering how Israel is going to come back after all this, I
suspect you already forgot how it managed to come back
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Gaza%E2%80%93Israel_conflict">after
2006</a>. I’m not sure how that makes me feel. On the one hand, I have
completely checked out. The people in charge are utter villains. The
settlements, the cutting down of trees, the terrorizing, the things one
reads in the news if one cares to look are in a vague but emotionally
crushing and morally grinding way similar to how the territory of the US
was built on rape, murder, land grab, death marches and reservations. On
the other hand, I think we cannot let that hold us back from seeking a
better future. We must not stare at the bloody entrails left behind on
this road to war. Yes, the news is grim. We must look past it, however.
What comes after that? Where will we be in forty years? In twenty years?
In five years? In two years? Next year? How will it be better than this?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“The disparity in conditions in the north and south is clear evidence
that aid restrictions in the north are costing lives. UNICEF and WFP
malnutrition screenings in the north in January found that nearly 16 per
cent - or 1 in 6 children under 2 years of age - are acutely
malnourished. Similar screenings conducted in the south in Rafah, where
aid has been more available, found 5 per cent of children under 2 years
are acutely malnourished.” –
<a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/statement-adele-khodr-unicef-regional-director-middle-east-and-north-africa-0">Statement
by Adele Khodr, UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North
Africa</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And if you think a solution is impossible, then take heart. The world
has managed to come back from two World Wars and countless other brutal
wars. Peace is possible. People are not inherently evil. Most people
want peace. Those in power and the people surrounding them and
supporting them often don’t want peace, however. And once the slaughter
starts, it’s hard to stop. Peace is hard.
</p>
<p>
Often the people arguing for war just can’t imagine peace because of
this detail or that detail. And the details are hard to get right, for
sure. But they are not impossible. Imagination is required. How else are
people going to make plans for after the war? The war will end one day.
And those who survived will be following plans that somebody imagined.
It is important to imagine a happy, prosperous future and then to make
plans of how to get there.
</p>
<p>
I remember how I was a German speaking kid in Portugal in the eighties
and sometimes I’d be greeted by an angry “Heil Hitler!” from kids my
age. And Portugal wasn’t even in the war! But all the killing takes
generations to forgive and forget. The longer it takes us to get to
peace, the longer it will take to forgive. And once there is peace, we
must not squander it. We need to work for it. We need to keep aiming for
that happy, prosperous future and stick to plans that go there. Don’t
follow leaders without a clear plan. If they don’t have one, they don’t
care or they’re unwilling to listen. There are many people with plans
for peace. It’s just that the road is hard. And yet, that is the road we
have.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Stop the killing.
</li>
<li>
Respect human rights.
</li>
<li>
Implement justice.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Yes, it’s hard. But the alternative isn’t looking good. And we know how
to do this. We have negotiated countless peace treaties. We have found
solutions to thorny issues all over the world. This is not an impossible
task.

“We laugh so we don’t cry,” I heard Sarah Taber say in her Farm to Taber
podcast, either in
<a href="https://shows.acast.com/farm-to-taber/episodes/the-true-story-of-us-agriculture">Season
4, Ep. 7: The History of US Agriculture: How Jim Crow paid off for the
Midwestern family farm</a> or in
<a href="https://shows.acast.com/farm-to-taber/episodes/king-cotton-jim-crow-and-pellagra">Season

</p>
<p>
In that spirit,
<a href="https://existentialcomics.com/comic/527">Existential Comics
527: Fantasy Morality</a> has this note at the end:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Since the good guys always win in the end, and are typically
outnumbered, this becomes pretty important. The orcs will brutally,
savagely kill a few dozen elves, and the elves will respond in a very
civilized fashion by wiping out the entire orc civilization. You can
even still see this kind of justification in contemporary colonialism
(<em>cough Israel cough</em>).

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Whether or not we&amp;#8217;re older adults, we all are being bombarded with a blunt political narrative about aging that is as wrong as it is dangerous. In essence, the message is that &amp;#8220;old&amp;#8221; equals &amp;#8220;bad&amp;#8221; and that if a person is going to be a leader, they had better do it while they are young. Headlines, campaign messages and political cartoons, often across party affiliations, draw upon ageist tropes, painting older people as inherently deficient.&lt;/p&gt;

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Nvidia Corp.&amp;#8217;s rise is captivating the stock market and driving the S&amp;#038;P 500 Index to new highs. But it also raises cautionary reminders of another investor darling that soared on dreams of a technological transformation, only to tumble back to earth when those hopes turned to disappointment. That stock belongs to Tesla Inc., which sparked its own mania in 2017 as investors bet that electric vehicles were going to take over the world. Back then, Elon Musk&amp;#8217;s company was a phenomenon as it blew past established carmakers like General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. in market capitalization to become America&amp;#8217;s biggest auto manufacturer. Some analysts were looking beyond the industry and calling it &amp;#8220;the next Apple Inc.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

<h2
id="republican-voters-clash-over-whether-haley-should-remain-in-nomination-race">Republican
Voters Clash Over Whether Haley Should Remain in Nomination Race</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW ORLEANS — As the Republican Party primary contests continue into
their third month, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley is the
only remaining challenger to former U.S. President Donald Trump. </p>
<p>The primaries will determine who is the GOP’s nominee for president
and who will challenge President Joe Biden in November’s presidential
election.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Trump has won all but one of the 11 primaries and caucuses so far,
racking up 276 total delegates to Haley’s 43. (Haley earned her first
victory in Washington D.C. this past weekend, a contest long predicted
to go her way.) With 15 states casting their votes for a nominee on
March 5, a day known as “Super Tuesday,” Republicans are divided on
whether Haley should remain in the race or get out of the former
president’s way.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“If you’re a Democrat, you probably want Haley to stay in the race
because she’s distracting Trump from focusing on defeating Biden,”
explained Bob Carreto, a Trump supporter from Chalmette, Louisiana. “But
if you’re a real Republican, you want her to drop out of the primaries
as fast as possible.”</p>
<p>“She’s forcing Trump to spend money defeating her, and it’s not good
for the Republican Party,” Carreto said. “But the reality is, she
doesn’t stand a chance, so she should just quit.”</p>
<p>Even though Trump has won each of the contests so far, not all voters
who could cast their ballot this November for a Republican think Haley
should exit.</p>
<p>“I think she’s incredibly brave for staying in the race, especially
given that Trump is a maniacal egoist who attacks anyone who challenges
him,” Abby LaCombe, an independent voter from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
told VOA. </p>
<p>“She’s facing a lot of attacks for refusing to withdraw, and she’s
giving people who vote Republican a choice — the ability to choose
someone other than Trump, a politician who has shown he has no respect
whatsoever for democracy,” LaCombe said.</p>
<p>The Haley campaign did not respond to VOA’s request for comment when
asked what Haley would say to those questioning why she is staying in
the race.</p>
<p>Uphill battle</p>
<p>The Trump campaign has been insistent on undercutting Haley’s
challenge by </p>
<p>highlighting her many stumbles at the ballot box. In her home state
of South Carolina, for example, the former president collected 60% of
the vote to her 40%.</p>
<p>Michigan is a more moderate state where independent voters — thought
to be more receptive to Haley’s message — are allowed to vote in the
Republican primary. Still, in the state’s recent primary, Trump’s margin
of victory was even greater (68% to 27%).</p>
<p>“She can’t name one state she can win, let alone be competitive in,”
Steven Cheung, a Trump spokesperson, said in a statement last week.</p>
<p>The Haley campaign did not respond to VOA’s request for comment when
asked where she believes she can win on Super Tuesday or beyond.</p>
<p>On Sunday’s “Meet the Press” talk show, Haley said, “I think we
fight. You’re going to have 16 states and territories that are voting on
Tuesday. And so, a lot of people’s voices are going to be heard. And
that’s what this has all been about.”</p>
<p>Most political experts, like University of Georgia political
scientist Charles Bullock, agree that it will be difficult for Haley to
win against the former president.</p>
<p>“I think it’s probably too late for her,” he explained to VOA. “This
is Trump’s party, and he controls its voters. It’s a party dominated by
an electorate who will stick with him no matter what — probably until he
dies or withdraws from public view.”</p>
<p>Bullock, however, sees one way the Republican faithful could abandon
him.</p>
<p>“A conviction,” he said. “Polling shows that if he is convicted of
one of the several crimes he is accused of, then a substantial number of
voters would abandon him. I think it’s possible that Haley is waiting,
hopeful she could gather his votes if a conviction takes place.”</p>
<p>Trump faces 91 charges in four trials, including allegations he
illegally tried to upend his 2020 election loss, whether he illegally
took highly classified documents with him when he left office, and
whether he falsified documents related to hush-money paid to a porn
actor.</p>
<p>He has denied all the allegations.</p>
<p>Motivation for remaining in the race</p>
<p>A Reuters/Ipsos poll from last month found that 51% of Republican
voters said they would not vote for Trump if he was convicted of any of
the 91 felony charges brought against him across four criminal trials. A
further 25% said they weren’t sure how they would vote in that case.</p>
<p>Fifty-eight percent said they would not vote for Trump if he were
serving time in prison in November.</p>
<p>While experts like Bullock believe a Trump conviction might be
Haley’s reason for staying in the race, others say she could have other
motivations.</p>
<p>Henry Olsen, a senior fellow with the Ethics and Public Policy
Center, believes Haley, the former U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, hopes if she can win several states, it will allow her to gain
concessions from Trump during the Republican National Convention.</p>
<p>“She’s been spending her time in more moderate states and states
where independent voters are also allowed to take part in the Republican
primary,” Olsen said, adding, “states like Minnesota, where Marco Rubio
beat Trump in the 2016 primary, and Colorado, where moderate Republican
Senator Joe O’Dea beat a Trump-supported opponent by a wide margin.”</p>
<p>“Utah, Vermont, Massachusetts and Maine are all in the same boat, and
if she can win five states, Republican Party rules will give her more
time and clout at the convention to voice her opposition to Trump,”
Olsen continued. “Those wins are going to be a stretch for her, but if
she gets them, Trump’s team will want to avoid any bad attention at the
convention and may be willing to give concessions important to her, like
a promise to support NATO.”</p>
<p>Other experts, like David Stack, a political scientist at Cleveland
State University, thinks Haley might have one eye set on the 2028
presidential election.</p>
<p>“I just don’t see Haley having a path to the nomination this cycle,”
Stack told VOA. “Her best bet for a win on Super Tuesday might be in
Vermont, but even there she is down by about 30% in polling.”</p>
<p>“So, the question then is why is she staying in the race?” Stack
said. “I think it could be to bolster her name recognition and collect
donations for future elections. If she has a good amount of money in the
bank after Super Tuesday, that could be a sign she is building a war
chest for the future.”</p>
<p>Alternative to Trump</p>
<p>For her part, Haley insists her focus is on the present and that she
believes she is the Republican Party’s best chance at unseating
President Biden.</p>
<p>“This has never been about me or my political future,” Haley said
last week after her defeat in the South Carolina primaries. “We need to
beat Joe Biden in November. I don’t believe Donald Trump can beat Joe
Biden. Nearly every day, Trump drives people away.”</p>
<p>She added, “I’m an accountant. I know 40% is not 50%, but I also know
40% is not some tiny group. There are huge numbers in our Republican
primaries who are saying they want an alternative.”</p>
<p>Jason Winder, a Republican from Uintah County, Utah, says he is one
of those voters and is looking forward to casting his ballot for Haley
on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“I like the idea of having a choice, and I’m grateful to still be
able to show my dissent for Trump by backing someone who wasn’t involved
in the January 6 insurrection,” Winder told VOA. “I hope the GOP
leadership wakes up. He lost the popular vote in 2016 and 2020, and I
think the margins will be even bigger this year. At least Nikki Haley
gives us a chance.”</p>
<p>This week, Haley told supporters at a rally in Minnesota that Trump
can’t win the general election if he’s losing 40% of the vote, and
polling has shown a sizable portion of the Republican Party believe
Trump is too extreme to defeat Biden. Nearly nine in 10 Haley voters in
South Carolina said they would not be satisfied with Trump as the
Republican Party’s presidential nominee.</p>
<p>As a result, support in the form of fundraising dollars and
endorsements from moderate segments of the Republican Party continue to
find their way to the former governor.</p>
<p>On Friday, Haley received endorsements from two of the party’s most
moderate senators, Susan Collins from Maine and Lisa Murkowski from
Alaska.</p>
<p>Despite that support, many in the party, including Trump’s most
ardent supporters, continue to push Haley to exit the race.</p>
<p>“I actually like Nikki Haley and I would vote for her if she was the
nominee,” explained Harvey Wasserman, a resident of Daytona Beach,
Florida. “But I’ve voted for Trump twice and I’m going to do it again in
the primary. I don’t think she can win, so it’s time for her to give the
stage to Trump so he can focus on Biden.”</p>

<h2 id="donald-trump-wins-north-dakota-republican-caucuses">Donald Trump
Wins North Dakota Republican Caucuses</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BISMARCK, N.D. — Donald Trump won the North Dakota Republican
presidential caucuses on Monday, adding to his string of victories
heading into Super Tuesday.</p>
<p>The former president finished first in voting conducted at 12 caucus
sites, ahead of former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. The result puts
Trump back on the winning track, which was briefly interrupted on Sunday
when Haley notched her first victory of the campaign in the District of
Columbia’s primary.</p>
<p>The White House hopefuls now turn their attention to Super Tuesday,
when results will pour in from 16 states in contests that amount to the
single biggest delegate haul of any day in the presidential primary.
Trump and President Joe Biden, a Democrat, are dominating their races
and are on track to winning their nominations later this month.</p>
<p>Under North Dakota’s rules, candidates are eligible to win delegates
if they finish with at least 20% of the vote. However, a candidate who
wins at least 60% of the vote receives all of the state’s 29
delegates.</p>
<p>Four candidates were on the ballot, including Trump and Nikki Haley.
The other candidates, who have received little attention, were Florida
businessman David Stuckenberg and Texas businessman and pastor Ryan
Binkley, who recently ended his campaign.</p>
<p>Retired music teacher and librarian Karen Groninger, of Almont, said
Monday that she voted for Trump, calling him the best choice. The
76-year-old cited Trump’s 2020 speech at the annual March for Life
anti-abortion event in Washington, D.C. — the first by a sitting
president — and his border policies.</p>
<p>Longtime Republican state Sen. Dick Dever, of Bismarck, said he voted
for Haley, but added she’s unlikely to win. The retired factory
representative, 72, said, “I hear an awful lot of people say that they
really liked Trump’s policies, but they don’t like the way he conducts
himself, and I think he’s gone overboard a bit.”</p>
<p>Caucus voters were encouraged to be paying party members, but those
who wouldn’t pay $50 for annual membership were asked to sign a pledge
to affiliate with the party, caucus Chair Robert Harms said.</p>
<p>North Dakota is the only state without voter registration. The
caucuses followed official state voter identification protocols, such as
providing a driver’s license. Voting was done only in person and on
printed ballots, which will be hand-counted.</p>
<p>In 2016, it was a North Dakota delegate who helped Trump secure the
number needed for the Republican presidential nomination.</p>
<p>He swept North Dakota’s three electoral college votes in 2016 and
2020, winning about 63% and 65% of those votes, respectively.</p>
<p>As president, Trump visited Bismarck and Mandan in 2017 to talk about
tax cuts, and he campaigned twice in Fargo in 2018 for Kevin Cramer in
the then-congressman’s successful Senate bid against Democratic
Sen. Heidi Heitkamp.</p>
<p>North Dakota’s Democratic-NPL Party is holding a presidential primary
almost entirely by mail, with mail-in voting from Feb. 20 to March 30,
and limited in-person voting for residents of Indian reservations.
President Joe Biden, Rep. Dean Phillips and six others are on the
ballot.</p>
<p>A third party will count ballots in Fargo on March 30, with results
available on the party’s website afterward.</p>
<p>Sen. Bernie Sanders won the Democratic caucuses in 2016 and 2020.</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris reiterated Monday support for an
“immediate” six-week cease-fire in Gaza, meeting with a top member of
Israel’s war Cabinet as the conflict teeters on the five-month mark. But
analysts and protesters note that stopping the conflict hinges on
negotiations the Biden administration won’t discuss, and that may not
yield a deal before the White House’s stated deadline – the start of
Ramadan. VOA’s Anita Powell reports from the White House.</p>

<h2 id="us-low-iran-election-turnout-another-sign-of-discontent">US: Low
Iran Election Turnout Another Sign of ‘Discontent’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States said Monday that the low turnout in
Iran’s election came as no surprise and was a new sign of discontent in
the cleric-run state.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there’s any doubt that there’s discontent about the
regime’s rule,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told
reporters.</p>
<p>“We did not assess that these elections would be free and fair, and I
believe that many Iranian voters would assess that the elections would
not be free and fair, and so it wouldn’t surprise me if in that regard
they chose not to participate,” he said.</p>
<p>Election authorities said Monday that conservatives and
ultra-conservatives secured a large majority in parliamentary elections
— in which many hopefuls including moderates and reformists were
disqualified from running.</p>
<p>Authorities said turnout was 41%, the lowest since the 1979 Islamic
Revolution toppled the pro-Western shah.</p>
<p>Miller said that the United States could not offer its own assessment
but added: “Iranian authorities’ claims about turnout have generally
been unreliable.”</p>
