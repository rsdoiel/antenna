<h2 id="snikket-this-weeks-sponsor">Snikket: this week’s sponsor</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>Snikket is a FOSS project for creating private chat spaces for small
groups, such as families, friends, or clubs. It doesn’t depend on a
phone number, doesn’t upload address books anywhere, and doesn’t sell
data to advertisers. It supports all the features you expect, including
media and voice messages, audio and video calls, end-to-end encryption,
group messaging, and more. Use it from multiple devices at once with the
official apps, or even with unofficial, third-party apps. Snikket is
easy to self-host, and professional managed hosting is also available.
Our previous sponsor, JMP, opted to donate a free week’s sponsorship to
Snikket, which any paying OSNews sponsor can opt to do. This is our very
small way of giving something back to the countless open source and/or
smaller projects out there. Thank you Snikket for sponsoring OSNews!</p>

PowerPC, Windows CE and the WiiN-PAD slate, everyone’s a WiiN-er (except
Data General)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>That’s right: it’s PowerPC, the most unloved of the architectures CE
ever ran on — in fact, this is the first PowerPC Windows CE device I’ve
ever found, and I’m the self-described biggest pro-PowerPC bigot in the
world. Here’s an unusual form factor Windows CE device, running on the
operating system’s least used CPU, from a storied computer company near
the end of its run, intended for medical applications, produced in very
small numbers and cancelled within months. What are we going to do with
it? Well, what do you think we’re gonna do with it? We’re going to
program it, so that we can finally have some software! And, of course,
since this wacky thing was there at the bitter end, we’ll talk more
about the last days of Data General and what happened next. ↫ Cameron
Kaiser I knew Windows CE supported PowerPC, but I never knew any
PowerPC-based Windows CE devices ever actually shipped and made it to
market. Only Windows CE 2.0 seems to have supported the architecture,
and it seems to have been eliminated in 3.0 and 4.0, so it’s not
surprising there weren’t many PowerPC Windows CE devices out there. The
device that’s the subject of this article, too, only lasted on the
market for a few months, so it’s definitely a rarity.</p>

Mathematics</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-06, from: Quanta Magazine</p>
In 1940 André Weil wrote a letter to his sister, Simone, outlining his
vision for translating between three distinct areas of mathematics.
Eighty years later, it still animates many of the most exciting
developments in the field.

<p>date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>Still rocking your Palm OS device, but mutter under your breath every
time you need to log into a website or service with two-factor
authentication? Sick of carrying around an Android or iOS device just so
you can log in on your Palm PDA? Worry no more, your prayers have been
answered, you can finally throw that Android or iOS garbage into the
sun. Get your 2-factor codes on your Palm, just like Google
Authenticator. Unlike Hotpants (an old port of a J2ME phone app), this
version takes up much less space and supports all Palm OS versions. ↫
Nathan Korth You can now generate 2FA codes on your Palm device. This is
wild, and I absolutely love it. I might if set it up on one of my dozens
of Palm OS devices and just put it next to my keyboard for easy access.
There’s no cooler way to handle 2FA than this.</p>

University cancels main commencement after protests that roiled campus
for weeks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Columbia University is canceling its large university-wide
commencement ceremony amid ongoing pro-Palestinian protests but will
hold smaller school-based ceremonies this week and next, the university
announced Monday.</p>
<p>“Based on feedback from our students, we have decided to focus
attention on our Class Days and school-level graduation ceremonies,
where students are honored individually alongside their peers, and to
forego the university-wide ceremony that is scheduled for May 15,”
Columbia officials said in a statement.</p>
<p>The protests stem from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas
militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly
civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages. Vowing to destroy Hamas,
Israel launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 34,500
Palestinians, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to
the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. Israeli strikes have
devastated the enclave and displaced most of its inhabitants.</p>
<p>The University of Southern California earlier canceled its main
graduation ceremony while allowing other commencement activities to
continue.</p>

published in <em>Science Advances</em> finds that nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
pollution from gas and propane stoves could be responsible for 50,000
U.S. cases of childhood asthma and up to 19,000 adult deaths each year.
For the study, scientists from Stanford University, Harvard University,
and the Central California Asthma Collaborative measured NO2 levels in
more than 100 homes and created an air quality index that pulled in
other data sets including cooking habits, ventilation, and home size.
Their results show that NO2 pollution spreads throughout the home, and
people living in spaces that are less than 800 square feet in size have
four times more long-term NO2 exposure than people in homes that are
larger than 3,000 square feet. Indigenous, Alaska Native, Hispanic and
Black households have the highest exposure to NO2.

<p>In 1776, as British colonists in North America were contemplating how
to construct a new nation, Massachusetts lawyer John Adams famously
wrote to friends about the relationship between government and the law.
A republic, he wrote, “is an Empire of Laws and not of Men: and
therefore…that particular Arrangement…which is best calculated to Secure
an exact and impartial Execution of the Laws, is the best Republic.”</p>

id="mexican-authorities-thieves-killed-american-2-australians-to-steal-their-truck">Mexican
authorities: Thieves killed American, 2 Australians to steal their
truck</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Mexico City — Thieves killed two Australians and an American on a
surfing trip to Mexico to steal their truck, particularly because they
wanted the tires, authorities said Sunday.</p>
<p>Baja California state prosecutors released grisly details of the
slayings but have not yet officially confirmed the identity of the
bodies. They said family members of the victims are viewing the bodies
to see if they can be identified by sight.</p>
<p>The corpses were decomposing after the thieves dumped them into a
remote, 15-meter deep well. If relatives can’t identify them, further
tests will be conducted. The well also contained a fourth cadaver that
had been there much longer.</p>
<p>“The probability that it’s them is very high,” said chief state
prosecutor Maria Elena Andrade Ramirez, noting the corpses still
appeared to be identifiable by sight.</p>
<p>The three men went missing last weekend during a camping and surfing
trip, posting idyllic photos on social media of waves and isolated
beaches along a stretch of coast south of the city of Ensenada.</p>
<p>But Andrade Ramirez described the moments of terror that ended the
trip for brothers Jake and Callum Robinson from Australia and American
Jack Carter Rhoad.</p>
<p>She said the killers drove by and saw the foreigners’ pickup truck
and tents, and wanted to steal their tires.</p>
<p>“Surely, they resisted,” she said of the victims, and the thieves
shot them to death.</p>
<p>The thieves then went to what she called “a site that is extremely
hard to get to” and dumped their bodies into a well they apparently were
familiar with. She said investigators were not ruling out the
possibility the same suspects also dumped the first, earlier body in the
well as part of their thefts.</p>
<p>“They may have been looking for trucks in this area,” Andrade Ramirez
said.</p>
<p>The site where the bodies were discovered near the township of Santo
Tomas was near the remote seaside area where the missing men’s tents and
truck were found Thursday along the coast. From their last photo posts,
the trip looked perfect. But even experienced local expats are
questioning whether it is safe to camp along the largely deserted coast
anymore.</p>
<p>The moderator of the local Talk Baja internet forum, who has lived in
the area for almost two decades, wrote in an editorial Saturday that
“the reality is, the dangers of traveling to and camping in remote areas
are outweighing the benefits anymore.”</p>
<p>Baja California prosecutors had said they were questioning three
people in the case. On Friday, the office said the three had been
arrested on charges of a crime equivalent to kidnapping, but that was
before the bodies were found. It was unclear if they might face more
charges.</p>
<p>At least one of the suspects was believed to have directly
participated in the killings.</p>
<p>Last week, the missing Australians’ mother, Debra Robinson, posted on
a local community Facebook page an appeal for help in finding her sons.
Robinson said Callum and Jake had not been heard from since April 27.
They had booked accommodations in the nearby city of Rosarito.</p>
<p>Robinson said one of her sons, Callum, was diabetic. She also
mentioned that the American who was with them was named Jack Carter
Rhoad, but the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City did not immediately confirm
that. The U.S. State Department said it was aware of reports of a U.S.
citizen missing in Baja but gave no further details.</p>
<p>In 2015, two Australian surfers, Adam Coleman and Dean Lucas, were
killed in western Sinaloa state, across the Gulf of California — also
known as the Sea of Cortez — from the Baja peninsula. Authorities said
they were victims of highway bandits. Three suspects were arrested in
that case.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-run-a-bsd-on-a-pc">Why I run a BSD on a PC</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>But the biggest differential factor between BSDs and GNU/Linux is the
way it is structured. In Linux, all components are designed to work
together, but are completely separate. You’ve got the kernel, init
systems, multimedia daemons, userland, bootloader, virtualization and
containerization mechanisms, package managers, and so on. They are all
separate projects with their own goals and are operated by separate
entities. This is why we’ve got different Linux Distributions instead of
Operating System. Everyone can take the kernel, start adding components
on top of it, and a few minutes later the DistroWatch is even harder to
keep up with. Each BSD on the other hand is designed as single system.
All components are created and developed together. Things work together
perfectly, because they are designed, coded, tested and released as one.
↫ Michał Sapka As I’ve mentioned here and there over the past few weeks,
I’ve been exploring the world of BSD lately, and after bouncing of
FreeBSD I’ve found a very happy home on OpenBSD. Now, this doesn’t mean
I’m now a full-time OpenBSD user or anything like that – Linux is the
main operating system on my gaming PC, my laptop, and my workstation,
and that’s not going to be changing any time soon. However, after
installing, exploring, and using OpenBSD on a machine cobbled together
from spare and older parts, I can definitely see the appeal. OpenBSD
feels more coherent than a Linux distribution – I use Fedora KDE, if
that matters – and the various lower-level systems seem to talk to each
other in ways that make more intuitive sense than the individually
developed systems in a Linux distribution do. Diving into the
command-line interface of a Linux distribution can sometimes feel
confusing because different tools use different conventions, because
they’re developed by entirely different people and projects, with
different ideas about how flags should work, how output should be
presented, and so on. On OpenBSD, it seems much easier to carry over
something you learn from one tool to the next. I simply feel more secure
and knowledgeable, even if it’s still the same idiot me. The
documentation plays a big role here. They’re in one place, written in a
consistent style, and reference each other left and right, making it
easy to find your way around to other commands or tools you haven’t yet
considered using. On Linux, you’re going from one project’s
documentation to another project’s documentation, and not only will the
style change, the quality will also vary greatly. That’s not to say
everything’s perfect on OpenBSD – it’s clearly a hardened server
operating system, and its focus on security will definitely throw up
annoying hurdles if you’re just trying to do workstation things.
Firefox, for instance, is hobbled by strict security rules through
unveil, which makes perfect sense for what OpenBSD is first and foremost
trying to be, but if you’re just a regular user like me, it’s annoying
that Firefox can only access ~/Downloads, or that it can’t set itself as
the default browser so unless you disable that check, Firefox will keep
complaining about it. Diving into Firefox and unveil is on my list,
though, because you should be able to ‘fix’ this. Furthermore, while
every piece of software, or an equivalent, is pretty much always
available for Linux, on OpenBSD it’s more hit and miss, and it seems to
take a bit longer for new releases of especially bigger software
packages to get updated. I mean, there’s obviously no Steam on OpenBSD,
but smaller, less well-known projects generally also don’t support
OpenBSD, so you’re either going to be compiling things yourself or hope
someone packages it up for OpenBSD. Then there’s the various vanity
things we’ve come to expect from modern Linux distributions, like slick,
fully graphical boot and shutdown sequences, detailed graphical tools
for managing your packages, graphical firmware and driver managers, and
so on. OpenBSD has none of these things, and while that’s no issue for
me, I can see how it would throw other people off. FreeBSD, OpenBSD,
NetBSD, and the few others often kind of get lost in all the Linux,
Windows, and macOS violence, and to be quite honest – I feel like many
people in the BSD community seem mostly okay with that. If you’ve never
spent any serious time using any of the BSDs, but you’re interested in
operating systems and don’t mind spending a few hours learning how to
manipulate your system through CLI tools – dive in. There’s a ton of fun
to be had, and things to learn. For now, I’m continuing my exploration
of OpenBSD, and if things keep going as well as they are, I may consider
at least switching over the workstation in my office from Fedora KDE to
OpenBSD – but I highly doubt it’ll ever make its way to my gaming
desktop or my laptop.</p>

version control system</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Game of Trees (Got) is a version control system which prioritizes
ease of use and simplicity over flexibility. Got is still under
development; it is being developed on OpenBSD and its main target
audience are OpenBSD developers. Got uses Git repositories to store
versioned data. Git can be used for any functionality which has not yet
been implemented in Got. It will always remain possible to work with
both Got and Git on the same repository. ↫ Game of Trees website OpenBSD
is developing Game of Trees because they want a version control system
that adheres to OpenBSD coding conventions, implements various OpenBSD
security practices, and uses nothing but BSD-licensed code. It’s
important to note, as its developers make very clear, that GoT is not in
any way intended as a replacement for git.</p>

id="as-us-spotlights-those-missing-or-dead-in-native-communities-prosecutors-work-to-solve-their-cases">As
US spotlights those missing or dead in Native communities, prosecutors
work to solve their cases</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Albuquerque, New Mexico — It was a frigid winter morning when
authorities found a Native American man dead on a remote gravel road in
western New Mexico. He was lying on his side, with only one sock on, his
clothes gone and his shoes tossed in the snow.</p>
<p>There were trails of blood on both sides of his body and it appeared
he had been struck in the head.</p>
<p>Investigators retraced the man’s steps, gathering security camera
footage that showed him walking near a convenience store miles away in
Gallup, an economic hub in an otherwise rural area bordered on one side
by the Navajo Nation and Zuni Pueblo on the other.</p>
<p>Court records said the footage and cell phone records showed the
victim — a Navajo man identified only as John Doe — was “on a collision
course” with the man who would ultimately be accused of killing him.</p>
<p>A grand jury has indicted a man from Zuni Pueblo on a charge of
second-degree murder in the Jan. 18 death, and prosecutors say more
charges are likely as he is the prime suspect in a series of crimes
targeting Native American men in Gallup, Zuni and Albuquerque.
Investigators found several wallets, cell phones and clothing belonging
to other men when searching his vehicle and two residences.</p>
<p>As people gathered around the nation on Sunday to spotlight the
troubling number of disappearances and killings in Indian Country,
authorities say the New Mexico case represents the kind of work the U.S.
Department of Justice had aspired to when establishing its Missing and
Murdered Indigenous Persons outreach program last summer.</p>
<p>Special teams of assistant U.S. attorneys and coordinators have been
tasked with focusing on MMIP cases. Their goal: Improve communication
and coordination across federal, tribal, state and local jurisdictions
in hopes of bridging the gaps that have made solving violent crimes in
Indian Country a generational challenge.</p>
<p>Some of the new federal prosecutors were participating in MMIP
Awareness Day events. From the Arizona state capitol to a cultural
center in Albuquerque and the Qualla Boundary in North Carolina,
marches, symposiums, art exhibitions and candlelight vigils were planned
for May 5, which is the birthday of Hanna Harris, who was only 21 when
she was killed on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in Montana in
2013.</p>
<p>It was an emotional day in Albuquerque, where family members and
advocates participated in a prayer walk. They chanted: “What do we want?
Answers! What do we want? Justice!” There were tears and long embraces
as they shared their stories and frustrations. They talked about feeling
forgotten and the lack of resources in Native communities.</p>
<p>Geraldine Toya of Jemez Pueblo marched with other family members to
bring awareness to the death of her daughter Shawna Toya in 2021. She
said she and her husband are artists who make pottery and never dreamed
they would end up being investigators in an effort to determine what
happened to their daughter.</p>
<p>“Our journey has been rough, but you know what, we’re going to make
this journey successful for all of our people that are here in this same
thing that we’re struggling through right now,” she said, vowing to
support other families through their heartbreak as they seek
justice.</p>
<p>Alex Uballez, the U.S. attorney for the District of New Mexico, told
The Associated Press on Friday that the outreach program is starting to
pay dividends.</p>
<p>“Providing those bridges between those agencies is critical to seeing
the patterns that affect all of our communities,” Uballez said. “None of
our borders that we have drawn prevents the spillover of impacts on
communities — across tribal communities, across states, across the
nation, across international borders.”</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Eliot Neal oversees MMIP cases for a region
spanning New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Utah and Nevada.</p>
<p>Having law enforcement agencies and attorneys talking to each other
can help head off other crimes that are often precursors to deadly
violence. The other pieces of the puzzle are building relationships with
Native American communities and making the justice system more
accessible to the public, Neal said.</p>
<p>Part of Neal’s work includes reviewing old cases: time-consuming work
that can involve tracking down witnesses and resubmitting evidence for
testing.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to flip that script a little bit and give those cases
the time and attention they deserve,” he said, adding that communicating
with family members about the process is a critical component for the
MMIP attorneys and coordinators.</p>
<p>The DOJ over the past year also has awarded $268 million in grants to
tribal justice systems for handling child abuse cases, combating
domestic and sexual violence and bolstering victim services.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Bree Black Horse was dressed in red as she
was sworn in Thursday during a ceremony in Yakima, Washington. The color
is synonymous with raising awareness about the disproportionate number
of Indigenous people who have been victims of violence.</p>
<p>She prosecutes MMIP cases in a five-state region across California
and the Pacific Northwest to Montana. Her caseload is in the double
digits, and she’s working with advocacy groups to identify more
unresolved cases and open lines of communication with law
enforcement.</p>
<p>An enrolled member of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma and a lawyer
for more than a decade, Black Horse said having 10 assistant U.S.
attorneys and coordinators focusing solely on MMIP cases is
unprecedented.</p>
<p>“This is an issue that has touched not only my community but my
friends and my family,” she said. “I see this as a way to help make sure
that our future generations, our young people don’t experience these
same kinds of disparities and this same kind of trauma.”</p>
<p>In New Mexico, Uballez acknowledged the federal government moves
slowly and credited tribal communities with raising their voices,
consistently showing up to protest and putting pressure on politicians
to improve public safety in tribal communities.</p>
<p>Still, he and Neal said it will take a paradigm shift to undo the
public perception that nothing is being done.</p>
<p>The man charged in the New Mexico case, Labar Tsethlikai, appeared in
court Wednesday and pleaded not guilty while standing shackled next to
his public defender. A victim advocate from Uballez’s office was there,
too, sitting with victims’ family members.</p>
<p>Tsethlikai’s attorney argued that evidence had yet to be presented
tying her client to the alleged crimes spelled out in court documents.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew McGinley argued that no conditions of
release would keep the community safe, pointing to cell phone data and
DNA evidence allegedly showing Tsethlikai had preyed on people who were
homeless or in need of alcohol so he could satisfy his sexual
desires.</p>
<p>Tsethlikai will remain in custody pending trial as authorities
continue to investigate. Court documents list at least 10 other victims
along with five newly identified potential victims. McGinley said
prosecutors wanted to focus on a few of the cases “to get him off the
street” and prevent more violence.</p>

of things</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>The big question – does all this have a future? The good news is that
all new hardware has generic support in X. Someone writes either a
modesetting kernel driver or a classical wsdisplay kernel driver and
they will be automatically supported by the associated drivers in X. The
bad news is that to have applications running we require access to a
larger open source ecosystem, and that ecosystem has a lot of churn and
is easily distracted by shiny new squirrels. The process of upstreaming
stuff to X.Org is an ongoing process, but it’s likely we’ll run into
things that will never be suitable for upstream. ↫ Nia Alarie on the
NetBSD blog I had no idea NetBSD did such heavy customisations of its
X.Org implementation, many of which have never made their way upstream.
The project also maintains support for several older GPUs, uses its own
input driver, and more – it’s quite impressive.</p>

new people at the helm, and the browser just released it first new
version since 2015. Dillo 3.1.0 brings a whole host of new features and

id="more-storms-move-through-houston-area-hundreds-already-rescued-from-floodwaters">More
storms move through Houston area; hundreds already rescued from
floodwaters</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Houston, Texas — More storms were moving through the already
saturated Houston area on Sunday, where flooding from heavy rains has
led to the rescue of hundreds of people from homes, rooftops and
roads.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be raining through the day and some of the storms
could be producing the heavier downpours,” said National Weather Service
meteorologist Hayley Adams.</p>
<p>Over the last week, areas near Lake Livingston, located northeast of
Houston, have gotten upwards of 50 centimeters of rain, she said, while
there has been as much as 30 centimeters of rain in that period in areas
of northeastern Harris County, the nation’s third-largest county that
includes Houston.</p>
<p>Adams said the storms coming through Sunday were expected to bring up
to 8 centimeters of rainfall, with up to 20 centimeters possible in some
areas.</p>
<p>“It’s going to keep rising this way,” said Miguel Flores Jr., who
lives in the northeast Houston neighborhood of Kingwood. “We don’t know
how much more. We’re just preparing for the worst.”</p>
<p>Houston authorities have not reported any deaths or injuries as a
wide region from Houston to rural East Texas has been swamped.</p>
<p>Flooding forces evacuations</p>
<p>Most weekends Flores’ father, Miguel Flores Sr., is mowing his huge
backyard on a 1-hectare lot behind his home in Kingwood. But on
Saturday, he and his family loaded several vehicles with clothes, small
appliances and other items.</p>
<p>Water from the San Jacinto River already had swallowed his backyard
and was continuing to rise, from about 30 centimeters high in the yard
Friday to about 1.2 meters the following day.</p>
<p>As storms forced numerous high-water rescues, including some from the
rooftops of flooded homes, officials redoubled urgent instructions for
residents in low-lying areas to evacuate, warning the worst was still to
come.</p>
<p>Greg Moss, 68, stood late Saturday afternoon by a golf cart as he
eyed the several centimeters of water covering the road that leads to
his home in Channelview, a community in eastern Harris County near the
San Jacinto River.  </p>
<p>Moss had managed to pack up many of his belongings and leave before
the road flooded Saturday.</p>
<p>“I would be stuck for four days,” Moss said. “So now at least I can
go get something to eat.”</p>
<p>He moved his belongings and vehicle to a neighbor’s home, where he
will stay until the waters recede. Moss said he is not worried his home
will flood because it’s located on higher ground.</p>
<p>Houston prone to flooding  </p>
<p>Houston is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the United
States. The city of more than 2 million people has long experience
dealing with devastating weather.</p>
<p>Hurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded
thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues by
government rescue personnel across Harris County.</p>
<p>The greater Houston area covers about 25,900 square kilometers, a
footprint slightly bigger than New Jersey. It is crisscrossed by about
2,700 kilometers of channels, creeks and bayous draining into the Gulf
of Mexico, about 80 kilometers southeast of downtown.</p>
<p>The system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains,
but the engineering initially designed nearly 100 years ago has
struggled to keep up with the city’s growth and bigger storms.</p>
<p>Husband and wife Aron Brown, 45, and Jamie Brown, 41, were two of the
many residents who drove or walked to watch the rising waters near a
flooded intersection close to the San Jacinto River. Nearby restaurants
and a gas station were beginning to flood.</p>
<p>What’s expected next</p>
<p>Rain in the area is expected to taper off by evening, said Adams, the
National Weather Service meteorologist. But next up, residents
recovering from the floods will have the heat and humidity to contend
with.</p>
<p>With a combination of the lingering moisture from the rains and
temperatures upwards of 32 C, the area may be looking at heat index
values in the triple digits this week, she said.</p>
<p>“We want people to be mindful of the increasing temperatures, and
heat exhaustion, heat stress,” she said.</p>

Fall Guy’ gives Hollywood a muted kickoff with $28.5M</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — “The Fall Guy,” the Ryan Gosling-led, action-comedy ode to
stunt performers, opened below expectations with $28.5 million,
according to studio estimates Sunday, providing a lukewarm start to a
summer movie season that’s very much to be determined for Hollywood.</p>
<p>The Universal Pictures release opened on a weekend that Marvel has
regularly dominated with $100 million-plus launches. (In 2023, that was
“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” with a $118 million debut.) But last
year’s strikes jumbled this year’s movie calendar; “Deadpool &amp;
Wolverine,” originally slated to open this weekend, is now debuting in
July.</p>
<p>So in place of a superhero kickoff, the summer launch went to a movie
about the stunt performers who anonymously sacrifice their bodies for
the kind of action sequences blockbusters are built on. Going into the
weekend, forecasts had the film opening $30 million to $40 million.</p>
<p>“The Fall Guy,” directed by former stuntman and “Deadpool 2” helmer
David Leitch, rode into the weekend with the momentum of glowing reviews
and the buzz of a SXSW premiere. But it will need sustained interest to
merit its $130 million production budget. It added $25.4 million in
overseas markets.</p>
<p>Working in its favor for a long run: strong audience scores (an “A-”
CinemaScore) and good reviews (83% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes). Jim Orr,
distribution chief for Universal, believes things line up well for “The
Fall Guy” in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>“We had a very solid opening,” said Orr. “We’re looking forward to a
very long, very robust, very successful run throughout the domestic box
office for literally weeks if not months to come.”</p>
<p>But the modest start for “The Fall Guy” hints at larger concerns for
the film industry. Superhero films haven’t been quite the box-office
behemoth they once were, leading studios to search for fresher
alternatives. “The Fall Guy” seemed to check all the boxes, with
extravagant action sequences, one of the hottest stars in the business,
a director with a track-record for crowd pleasers and very good
reviews.</p>
<p>But instead, the opening for “The Fall Guy,” loosely based on the
1980s TV series, only emphasized that the movie business is likely to
struggle to rekindle the fervor of last year’s “Barbenheimer” summer.
“The Fall Guy” stars one from each: Gosling, in his first post-Ken role,
and Emily Blunt, of “Oppenheimer.” Both were Oscar nominated.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be a very interesting, nontraditional summer this
year,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore.</p>
<p>In part because of last year’s work stoppages, there are fewer big
movies hitting theaters. Expectations are that the total summer box
office will be closer to $3 billion than the $4 billion that’s
historically been generated.</p>
<p>“The summer season is just getting started, so let’s give ‘The Fall
Guy’ a chance to build that momentum over time. It’s a different type of
summer kickoff film,” said Dergarabedian. “There’s always huge
expectations placed on any film that kicks off the summer movie season,
but this isn’t your typical summer movie season.”</p>
<p>In a surprise, No. 2 at the box office went to the Walt Disney
Co. rerelease of “Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.” The first episode to
George Lucas’ little-loved prequels collected $8.1 million over the
weekend, 25 years after “Phantom Menace” grossed $1 billion.</p>
<p>Last week’s top film, the Zendaya tennis drama “Challengers,” slid to
third place with $7.6 million in its second week. That was a sold hold
for the Amazon MGM release, directed by Luca Guadagnino, dipping 49%
from its first weekend.</p>
<p>The Sony Screen Gems supernatural horror film “Tarot” also opened
nationwide. It debuted with $6.5 million, a decent enough start for a
low-budget release but another example of horror not quite performing
this year as it has the last few years.</p>
<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian
theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released
Monday.</p>

<h2 id="driver-dies-after-ramming-car-into-white-house-gate">Driver dies
after ramming car into White House gate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A driver died after crashing a car into the exterior
gate of the White House late Saturday, the US Secret Service said. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Shortly before 10:30pm a vehicle traveling at a high speed collided
with an outer perimeter gate on the White House complex,” the service
said in a statement on social media platform X, adding there was “no
threat” to the White House itself. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Officers arriving at the scene “attempted to render aid to the driver
who was discovered deceased,” the statement said. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Secret Service, along with the police and fire departments of the
District of Columbia, have launched an investigation into the fatal
crash, according to Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He added there was “no threat or public safety implications”. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In January, authorities detained another person who crashed a vehicle
into the exterior gate of the same complex. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The White House has seen a string of high-profile trespassing
incidents in recent years, prompting the construction of a higher,
tougher metal fence around the iconic mansion’s perimeter in 2020.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-my-elasticsearch-query-so-slow">Why is my ElasticSearch
query so slow?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: Matthew Lincoln Blog</p>
<p>
The center of my working hours for the past two years has been
<a href="https://constellate.org">constellate.org</a>, a platform for
teaching, learning, and performing text analysis with scholarly and
primary source content from JSTOR, Portico, and elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Our dataset builder allows users to filter and explore a corpus of over
35 million documents. This search - and the analytical queries that
power the data visualizations in this builder - rely on an ElasticSearch
cluster on the backend. We rely heavily on ElasticSearch aggregations
every time a user updates their filters, taking the resulting set of
documents (no matter if it is 500 docs or 15 million) and count up the
different document types, providers, genres, decades of publication, and
more. These aggregations are memory-heavy actions, especially when
aggregating over 10+ million documents. Even so, ElasticSearch was
usually able to return results in under 3,000 milliseconds, providing an
acceptable user experience.
</p>
<h2 id="why-have-our-queries-gotten-slower-and-slower">
Why have our queries gotten slower and slower?
</h2>
<p>
But we started to see something concerning happening: over the past six
months, we watched the worst-case query durations (those the 95th
percentile execution time for all searches performed in a week) steadily
growing, starting to crest over an unbearable 10 seconds long. At that
point our default request timeouts on our backend services were truly
breaking the end user experience.
</p>

</p>

</figure>
<p>
I hadn’t made any changes to the way we composed the queries we sent to
ElasticSearch in that time. Our overall usage was increasing, yes, and
during very large bulk ingests we did see some overall slowdowns in
query processing as expected. But not at a pace that seemed liable to
explain why these pathological query times were growing steadily worse.
We had been steadily adding new documents to the index, some coming in
large monthly batches, but we’d been doing that for years without seeing
this kind of progressive slowdown.
</p>
<p>
So I started experimenting, running searches directly against our
cluster and one at a time, removing and adding back in the aggregations
to see if any oe was causing a particularly heavy load on the cluster.
The culprit: our aggregation of keyphrases, which were sets of
significant terms calculated for each document. For very large search
result sets that returned 20 or 30 million documents, the keyphrases
<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terms</code></a>
aggregation was adding between 3 and 8 ruinous whole seconds onto the
query.
</p>
<p>
Why was this
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terms</code>
aggregation so slow, while the half-dozen others we were running were
fast as ever? Cardinality. While we only have a handful of different
providers, a few dozen subject categorizations, and maybe a hundred
different languages, there are over <strong>50 million distinct
keyphrases</strong> in the system. With such high cardinality,
ElasticSearch had to generate an extremely large set of global ordinals
when being asked for a terms query, and then actually rank those
ordinals and return the top fifty most frequently occurring. Even
<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/eager-global-ordinals.html#_avoiding_global_ordinal_loading">precalculating
global ordinals</a> (the usual first step in addressing slow
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terms</code>
aggregations) was not enough to tame the IO needed to aggregate 30+
million documents’ intersection with 50+ million keyphrase values.
</p>
<p>
Why hadn’t this problem asserted itself before? Because for a few years,
we had only extracted keyphrases from about 1/3 of our documents, and
weren’t actively contributing new ones into the system. While better
automating our ingest pipelines this year, we took the opportunity to
regenerate a lot of our keyphrases, backfilling our database with an
enormous number of new keyphrase values. While this problem of
cardinality was in our system all along, the scale simply wasn’t large
enough to make its impact felt until recently.
</p>
<h2 id="so-make-the-problem-smaller">
So make the problem smaller
</h2>
<p>
Because we only want to get a relative ranking of the top keyphrases, a
straightforward way to reduce this problem is to use a
<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/search-aggregations-bucket-sampler-aggregation.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sampler</code></a>
aggregation. By grabbing a sample of up to 5,000 documents before
running the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terms</code>
aggregation, we easily brought the impact of the keyphrases aggregation
back under control. This effectively puts a ceiling on the number of
files whose keyphrases need to be looked up in an aggregation, and
mitigates the real scaling issues that we were starting to encounter
with our data.

id="new-us-army-video-aims-to-lure-recruits-for-psychological-operations">New
US Army video aims to lure recruits for psychological operations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>FORT LIBERTY, North Carolina — The video is unsettling, with haunting
images of faceless people, fire and soldiers. The voiceover is a cascade
of recognizable historical voices as the screen pulses cryptic messages
touting the power of words, ideas and “invisible hands.”</p>
<p>Hints of its origin are tucked into frames as they flash by: PSYWAR.
The U.S. Army’s psychological warfare soldiers are using their brand of
mental combat to bring in what the service needs: recruits. And if you
find the video intriguing, you may be the Army’s target audience as it
works to enlist soldiers to join its Special Operations Command.</p>
<p>Released early Thursday, the video is the second provocative
recruiting ad that, in itself, exemplifies the kind of work the psyop
soldiers do to influence public opinion and wage the war of words
overseas. Called “Ghosts in the Machine 2,” it is coming out two years
after the inaugural video was quietly posted on the unit’s YouTube site
and generated a firestorm of online chatter.</p>
<p>“It’s a recruiting video,” said the Army major who created it,
speaking with The Associated Press before the release. “Someone who
watches it and thinks, wow, that was effective, how was it constructed —
that’s the kind of creative mindset we’re looking for.”</p>
<p>The soldier, a member of the 8th Psychological Operations Group based
at Fort Liberty, North Carolina, also made the first video. He asked
that his name not be used to protect his identity, as is common among
special forces troops.</p>
<p>Psyop units are used for an array of missions that can range from
simple leaflet drops to more sophisticated propaganda and messaging
aimed at deceiving the enemy or shaping opinion on foreign soil. It’s
illegal for the U.S. military to conduct psychological operations on
Americans.</p>
<p>Army Special Operations Command leaders and special forces recruiters
hope that a new stream of chatter inspired by the video will help bring
in recruits to an often unseen and little known job.</p>
<p>“From a tactical level, the psyop mission is extremely hard to show
and tell,” said Lt. Col. Steve Crowe, commander of the Special Forces
Recruiting Battalion. And it’s the job in Army special forces that
recruiters say is the hardest to fill.</p>
<p>Across the military, the armed services have been struggling to meet
enlistment goals, with most falling far short of their targets in recent
years. The Army, which is the largest service, has had the most trouble,
missing its goal by about 15,000 soldiers for the past two years. But
most of the services say things are improving this year.</p>
<p>The Army’s Special Operations recruiters who recruit from
already-serving soldiers say they are making about 75% of their overall
goal, which is between 3,000 and 4,000. Of that, they have to bring in
about 650 active-duty soldiers to psychological operations per year.</p>
<p>Officials blame the nation’s low unemployment, increased competition
from corporate businesses, which can pay more and offer similar
benefits, and a sluggish return from several years of COVID-19 pandemic
restrictions that prevented recruiters from visiting schools and
attending other public events.</p>
<p>Recruiting struggles in Army Special Operations Command have mirrored
those of the larger Army. The recruiters said they are responsible for
bringing in several types of special forces — the most well-known are
the Green Berets and Delta Force, but there are also Civil Affairs,
Psychological Operations and the 160th Special Operations Aviation
Regiment, known as the Night Stalkers.</p>
<p>The Army has said it intends to trim the number of psyop soldiers but
still has struggled to fill the ranks.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most celebrated psyop was in World War II, when the
so-called U.S. Ghost Army outwitted the Germans using inflatable tanks,
radio trickery, costumes and impersonations. In what was dubbed
Operation Viersen, the soldiers used the inflatables, sound trucks and
phony headquarters to draw German units away from the point on the Rhine
River where the 9th Army was actually crossing. Several of the last
surviving members of the unit were recently awarded the Congressional
Gold Medal at a ceremony in Washington.</p>
<p>These days, psyop activities are often classified. But one of the
last U.S. service members to die in Afghanistan — killed by a suicide
bomber at Abbey Gate during the chaotic evacuation in 2021 — was a psyop
soldier: Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Knauss, 23, of Corryton, Tennessee. His
task that day was largely crowd control and influence, by using a
bullhorn to communicate with the frantic throngs of Afghans and get them
moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>A more recent example would be assistance to Ukraine. U.S.
psychological operations soldiers have advised and assisted Ukrainian
troops in their efforts to counter Russian disinformation campaigns
since 2014. After the Russian invasion in February 2022, Ukrainian
forces used a range of tactics — including leaflets and social media —
to entice Russian troops to surrender and tell them how and where to
give themselves up.</p>
<p>About half of the psychological operations troops are young people
who join when they enlist. The rest are recruited from within the Army’s
existing ranks. The command’s recruiters focus on the internal audience,
which has its own challenges.</p>
<p>A growing hurdle, according to Crowe and Army Maj. Jim Maicke,
executive officer of the Special Forces recruiting battalion, is that
these days regular soldiers across the Army have less interaction with
special operations forces than they did during the Iraq and Afghanistan
wars.</p>
<p>In those conflicts, soldiers often worked side-by-side with
commandos, or were deployed at the same bases and had a better view of
what they did.</p>
<p>“Business was generally pretty good. And the reason, we believe, was
all the interaction that was happening between special operations and
conventional forces,” said Crowe, adding that soldiers “got to see
behind the curtain, how we operate. We don’t have that anymore.”</p>
<p>It’s particularly difficult for psyops soldiers, whose work is often
less visible than that of the more celebrated Army commandos and not
always understood.</p>
<p>“We’re all nerds for sure,” said the Army major who created the ad.
“But we’re all nerds in different ways.” Usually, those who are drawn to
the job are “planners,” he said. “They’re writers, they’re great
thinkers. They’re idea people.”</p>
<p>Often, he said, they are creative, such as artists and illustrators,
but others are tech experts who can bring those ideas to life in videos
or online messaging.</p>
<p>The new “Ghosts in the Machine” video is aimed at that audience.</p>
<p>Recruiters say the first video was successful.</p>
<p>“I think what he does with ‘Ghosts in the Machine’ is it tells you
what psychological operations is, and shows you it, without telling you
in words,” said Crowe. “You watch the video and you’re like, OK, this is
how I’ll influence and change behavior.”</p>
<p>On a recent recruiting trip to the Citadel, the Military College of
South Carolina, the recruiters brought a psyop officer and a civil
affairs officer along to speak with the cadets.</p>
<p>“We had a very limited amount of time to engage about 450 cadets,”
said Maicke, a graduate of the college. “And the psyop officer chose to
give a brief introduction and then immediately turn on the ‘Ghosts in
the Machine’ video. He ended with, ‘if anyone has any questions about
this, I’m right over here,’ and business was booming.”</p>
<p>In fact, about six months after the first video was released, the
command began surveying soldiers who applied for the psyop mission and
got into the assessment and selection course. More than 51% said the
video had a medium to high level of influence on their decision to try
out for the job, recruiters said.</p>
<p>That, said the Army major, is the goal of the second video, which
ends with a crescendo of music, shots of marching military troops with
their arms raised in surrender, and a question streaming across the
screen: “Do you believe in the power of words and ideas. Will You. We
Believe.” The final frames say PSYWAR and show the website:

Air Force leader takes AI-controlled fighter jet ride in test vs human
pilot</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. — With the midday sun blazing, an
experimental orange and white F-16 fighter jet launched with a familiar
roar that is a hallmark of U.S. airpower. But the aerial combat that
followed was unlike any other: This F-16 was controlled by artificial
intelligence, not a human pilot. And riding in the front seat was Air
Force Secretary Frank Kendall.</p>
<p>AI marks one of the biggest advances in military aviation since the
introduction of stealth in the early 1990s, and the Air Force has
aggressively leaned in. Even though the technology is not fully
developed, the service is planning for an AI-enabled fleet of more than
1,000 unmanned warplanes, the first of them operating by 2028.</p>
<p>It was fitting that the dogfight took place at Edwards Air Force
Base, a vast desert facility where Chuck Yeager broke the speed of sound
and the military has incubated its most secret aerospace advances.
Inside classified simulators and buildings with layers of shielding
against surveillance, a new test-pilot generation is training AI agents
to fly in war. Kendall traveled here to see AI fly in real time and make
a public statement of confidence in its future role in air combat.</p>
<p>“It’s a security risk not to have it. At this point, we have to have
it,” Kendall said in an interview with The Associated Press after he
landed. The AP and NBC were granted permission to witness the secret
flight on the condition that it would not be reported until it was
complete because of operational security concerns.</p>
<p>The AI-controlled F-16, called Vista, flew Kendall in lightning-fast
maneuvers at more than 800 kph that put pressure on his body at five
times the force of gravity. It went nearly nose to nose with a second
human-piloted F-16 as both aircraft raced within 305 meters of each
other, twisting and looping to try force their opponent into vulnerable
positions.</p>
<p>At the end of the hour-long flight, Kendall said he’d seen enough to
trust this still-learning AI to decide whether to launch weapons in
war.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of opposition to that idea. Arms control experts and
humanitarian groups are deeply concerned that AI one day might be able
to autonomously drop bombs that kill people without further human
consultation, and they are seeking greater restrictions on its use.</p>
<p>“There are widespread and serious concerns about ceding
life-and-death decisions to sensors and software,” the International
Committee of the Red Cross has warned. Autonomous weapons “are an
immediate cause of concern and demand an urgent, international political
response.”</p>
<p>Kendall said there will always be human oversight in the system when
weapons are used.</p>
<p>The military’s shift to AI-enabled planes is driven by security, cost
and strategic capability. If the U.S. and China should end up in
conflict, for example, today’s Air Force fleet of expensive, manned
fighters will be vulnerable because of gains on both sides in electronic
warfare, space and air defense systems. China’s air force is on pace to
outnumber the U.S. and it is also amassing a fleet of flying unmanned
weapons.</p>
<p>Future war scenarios envision swarms of American unmanned aircraft
providing an advance attack on enemy defenses to give the U.S. the
ability to penetrate an airspace without high risk to pilot lives. But
the shift is also driven by money. The Air Force is still hampered by
production delays and cost overruns in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter,
which will cost an estimated of $1.7 trillion.</p>
<p>Smaller and cheaper AI-controlled unmanned jets are the way ahead,
Kendall said.</p>
<p>Vista’s military operators say no other country in the world has an
AI jet like it, where the software first learns on millions of data
points in a simulator, then tests its conclusions during actual flights.
That real-world performance data is then put back into the simulator
where the AI then processes it to learn more.</p>
<p>China has AI, but there’s no indication it has found a way to run
tests outside a simulator. And, like a junior officer first learning
tactics, some lessons can only be learned in the air, Vista’s test
pilots said.</p>
<p>Vista flew its first AI-controlled dogfight in September 2023, and
there have only been about two dozen similar flights since. But the
programs are learning so quickly from each engagement that some AI
versions being tested on Vista are beating human pilots in air-to-air
combat.</p>
<p>The pilots at this base are aware that in some respects, they may be
training their replacements or shaping a future construct where fewer of
them are needed.</p>
<p>But they also say they would not want to be up in the sky against an
adversary that has AI-controlled aircraft if the U.S. does not also have
its own fleet.</p>
<p>“We have to keep running. And we have to run fast,” Kendall said.</p>

PowerPC, Windows CE and the WiiN-PAD slate, everyone’s a WiiN-er (except
Data General)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: Old Vintage Computer Research</p>
Telemedicine (and mobile health generally) accumulated a hunk of public
mindshare during the pandemic emergency, but speaking as someone with a
day job in public health for almost two decades, it’s always been a
buzzword in certain corners of IT with enough money sloshing around that
vendors repeatedly flirted with it. Microsoft, of course, is no
exception, and on
<a href="https://news.microsoft.com/1998/10/12/health-care-vendors-adopt-windows-ce-for-mobile-applications/">at
least one occasion</a> in the late 1990s pitched Windows CE at this
space. After all, WinCE was oriented at low-power portable devices
perfect for medicine on the go, and like perennial predictions of “the
Linux desktop” finally taking off, Microsoft’s eager sales team was
certain the day of the portable physician’s device had come as well.
<p>
<p>And, well, no. I can’t think of a single product from that particular
salvo that actually survived, let alone thrived. But we’ve got one of
them here — and, as you might expect, there’s a few odd things about it.
First off, it’s a slate. (We call them tablets now, kids.)</p>

Yup, it’s really <em>that</em> Data General with <em>that</em> naming
convention. In fact, as the history will show, the Data General WiiN-PAD
is quite possibly the last computing device DG ever produced before EMC
bought them out and shut (most of) them down in 1999. (No, near as I can
determine, the name <i>WiiN-PAD</i> has nothing to do with the
unreleased
<a href="https://microsoft.fandom.com/wiki/Microsoft_WinPad">Microsoft

<p>

That’s right: it’s <em>PowerPC</em>, the most unloved of the
architectures CE ever ran on — in fact, this is the first PowerPC
Windows CE device I’ve ever found, and I’m the self-described biggest
pro-PowerPC bigot in the world. Here’s an unusual form factor Windows CE
device, running on the operating system’s least used CPU, from a storied
computer company near the end of its run, intended for medical
applications, produced in very small numbers and cancelled within
months.
<p>
What are we going to do with it? Well, what do you <em>think</em> we’re
gonna do with it? We’re going to <em>program</em> it, so that we can
finally have some software! And, of course, since this wacky thing was
there at the bitter end, we’ll talk more about the last days of Data
General and what happened next.
<p>
<a name='more'></a> We last ran into Data General in the 1980s with the
Data General/One, their (for 1984) ultraportable DOS laptop with a great
form factor and terrible screen
<a href="/2024/03/refurb-weekend-data-generalone-and.html">that we
rehabilitated</a>. Data General was founded in 1968 in Hudson,
Massachusetts by three disaffected Digital Equipment Corporation
employees, Edson de Castro, Henry Burkhardt III and Richard Sogge, along
with Herbert Richmond from Fairchild Semiconductor. de Castro had been
chief engineer of DEC’s 1965 12-bit PDP-8 minicomputer which by then was
one of the company’s strongest sellers. The PDP-8 was a less expensive
system than their bigger machines, but it was nevertheless costly to
manufacture due to its use of discrete logic modules and wirewrap. To de
Castro’s surprise and frustration, however, DEC management was
uninterested in an even lower-cost PDP-8 concept produced with newer
printed circuit board and wave soldering technologies. He was convinced
he could do better.
<p>
And the 1969 Nova did, in fact, do better. It used a similarly simple
accumulator-oriented instruction set like the PDP-8, but it was smaller,
faster and cheaper to produce, and its 16-bit word size could even
compete with DEC’s higher-end PDP-11. DEC’s unsuccessful lawsuit
probably only legitimized the upstart and it had stratospheric growth
into the mid-1970s — which came to a rapid halt with the 1974 Eclipse,
DG’s intended successor to the Nova with virtual memory and a proper
hardware stack. DG could not solve production problems with the Eclipse
for several years, leading to a wave of legal action from customers when
preorders didn’t arrive, and an effort to make a microcomputer Nova (the
microNOVA) failed in 1977. Data General’s attempt to leapfrog into the
32-bit world was the subject of the Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>The Soul
of a New Machine</i>, detailing a skunkworks project codenamed Eagle
that developed a backwards-compatible architecture, while another team
hit the second-system effect wall with Fountainhead as a more direct
technical assault on DEC VAX. Eagle became the extremely successful
AOS-based MV systems in 1980, a stupendous reversal of fortune for the
company that by 1984 had over US$1 billion in annual sales.
<p>
Still, the MV project was costly for Data General to develop, and many
former customers had abandoned them. This led to smaller projects in the
1980s as minicomputer makers confronted their fates against the rise of
the microcomputer. The Desktop Generation systems, using microECLIPSE
and Intel CPUs to run MS-DOS or CP/M concurrently with DG/RDOS, were
complex to use, expensive and unpopular, and only the Data General/One
laptop, an upscale product in a segment with relatively few competitors,
gained market traction. By 1988 Eagle and DG/One designer Tom West
convinced de Castro that DG’s proprietary legacy systems had no
long-term future against those from IBM (and, at the time, DEC), and
that they should become more commodity-focused and Unix-based, since the
market was going that way.
<p>
West’s prophecy was of course correct, though in ways the company
couldn’t have predicted. The 1989 Unix-based AViiON (a name likely
suggestive of “Nova II”) had the bad luck of selecting the Motorola
88000 as its CPU just two years before
<a href="/2023/11/the-apple-network-servers-all-too.html">Motorola
joined the AIM alliance</a> and later cancelled it, and their second
generation x86-based systems ended up hitting the market roughly at the
same time as everyone else’s. Worse, their attempts to distinguish
themselves with an innovative custom NUMA design turned out to perform
suboptimally with Windows NT. What had more of a lasting effect was the
1994 CLARiiON RAID array, introduced as the HADA “High Availability Disk
Array” for AViiON systems in 1992 before DG management realized it could
have broader market appeal. Although splitting CLARiiON off as its own
product made AViiON packages less attractive, CLARiiON arrays became a
solid moneymaker in their own right as they were regarded as more
reliable and higher-quality than other offerings.
<p>
A much lesser known part of Data General’s business were their portable
data entry terminals, introduced around 1994 and sold variously as the
DataGenies (I’d thought they’d call them DATAGENiiES but even DG’s
marketdroids have some taste). These were AA-powered rugged handheld
devices intended for use in the field, based around the 80C88 or a clone
like the NEC V25<!-- InfoWorld 2/13/95 --> and capable of running custom
applications. DataGenies were dockable with a PC to transmit information
and usually fitted with a small LCD screen, keypad and barcode reader.
The units were approved for hostile environments like oil rigs and boats
and largely used for tracking and inventory management. It seems they
were produced in some numbers as used examples even today are not hard
to find.
<p>
<p>Like most tech companies then and now, Data General had a small
Healthcare Division to get a taste of the dough flowing through the
moneyed halls of medicine, which existed in one form or another since at
least 1987. Much of their work involved using Data General server kit to
back partner frontends, such as
<a href="https://www.diagnosticimaging.com/view/his-firms-see-pacs-enterprise-wide-context">a
1996 partnership</a> that used AViiON hardware and CLARiiON disks as the
backend for separately-developed PACS teleradiology workstations, but at
least some of the Division’s operations sold customized DataGenies to
hospitals and clinics where they were used for basic nursing tasks like
vital signs and point-of-care testing.<!-- patent --> In 1998, Microsoft
<a href="https://news.microsoft.com/1998/07/21/microsoft-and-data-general-announce-strategic-alliance-to-help-health-care-customers-create-integrated-systems-using-microsoft-activex-for-healthcare/">announced</a>
a new “strategic alliance” with DG for “integrated systems” using what
Microsoft grandly termed “ActiveX for Healthcare.” In reality this was
actually more of the same: independent vendors would use ActiveX (i.e.,
Microsoft COM) components in their client software, encouraged and
supported by Microsoft and Data General’s network of “Healthcare
Competency Centers,” which would connect to BackOffice installs on
Windows NT running on AViiON. The first of the HCCs was scheduled to
open in Boston nearby the DG offices in July.</p>
<!--unsourced, not clear where this came from
Imagine you are seeing a sick family member at the hospital. A nurse enters the area to confirm the patient's vital signs. What's she recording that crucial information? Can you find a clipboard filled with handwritten notations?
Not if the nurse is part of a developing group of healthcare professionals using a handheld personal computer to gather this very important information. Designed to replace the old-fashioned clipboard for a means to gather and update patient information, the WiiN-PAD MK is a wireless device made to doctors, nurses, doctors, physicians, and other healthcare professionals.
The foundation is contoured to the body to ensure that clinicians could rest the device comfortably in their hip. Just 1 hand is necessary to maintain the lightweight instrument, which makes it unnecessary to place down it to input information.
Dave Kaiser, a leader in Anderson Design, states that the WiiN-PAD MK is supposed to lessen the transition into digital information collection. "Though some physicians have made the transition from the traditional guide manner of collecting patient information to digital computing, so most have yet to convert.
Co-worker Chris Hageman, that functioned as the project supervisor, states Data General needed the product to be sturdy enough to withstand a four-foot fall to a solid floor but mild enough to allow hospital personnel to take it about on eight-hour shifts.
Information is input to the WiiN-PAD MK in 3 manners. Or, they could utilize a touchscreen, that can be designed to be easy to read even in dimly lit rooms. The touchscreen reacts to both signature along with a stylus.

Barcode recognition was constructed to the product to minimize mistakes caused by the direct entry of an individual's history. Wireless technology has been incorporated to ensure information about an individual's drugs or symptoms may be recovered in a hospital's Most Important computer and seen on the WiiN-PAD MK anywhere in the facility
"The remarkable thing about the WiiN-PAD MK is that despite all of these features, it's still smaller and less awkward than comparable existing products," states Hageman. "The thin profile allows it to be taken as a novel."
Anderson Design also made certain that the device could resist the unique surroundings of a hospital, including the emergency area. Its keypad produces a seal on the front surface of the pc in order that water and body fluids can not penetrate the device. This seal also gets the medical instrument simple to clean with conventional practice disinfectants and cleaners. A soft durometer cloth covers outside connector parts.
Even the WiiN-PAD MK can communicate using either wireless networks or even traditional LANs which support hospital programs. It functions as an interactive application operating on the internet and as a heap tool using a modem for downloading. In addition, it's the ability to speak to IR-equipped devices, such as printers, with no cables.
The device, that can be IRDA compatible, may be connected to your cart or dangled out of an IV pole. Its little rechargeable battery has been positioned for simple access.
Joseph Shea, program director using the handheld pc group at Data General, states the product is appealing for health personnel because it is instinctive and comfortable to work with. "By bringing wireless data communication to this point of maintenance, crucial patient information could be gathered correctly and fast, resulting in much better and more timely treatment, storing valuable healthcare resources."

<p>DG’s relationship with Microsoft had an impact on their portables
line as well. Expanding the line to introduce a full medically-oriented
clinical handheld made sense to DG management, especially in a
environment where “vertical mobile markets” had just popped up on the
buzzword bingo card and were driving other small form factor devices.
This time, however, no doubt with Microsoft’s strong urging, the product
managers selected Windows CE as the base — not only to take advantage of
the ecosystem but also almost certainly as a sales adjunct to AViiON
hardware running Windows Terminal Services (now Remote Desktop Services)
to which Windows CE thin clients could connect. The WiiN-PAD’s trademark
application was <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/75561138">filed
September 29, 1998</a> and development occurred in the handheld division
<!--under program manager Joseph Shea?-->alongside Microsoft’s
subsequent
<a href="https://news.microsoft.com/1998/10/12/health-care-vendors-adopt-windows-ce-for-mobile-applications/">Windows
CE healthcare announcement in October</a>. Notably, the product they
constructed seems to have been completely specific to DG and not a
rebadge of anything else. Given that the device was completed around the
spring of 1999, it’s likely the WiiN-PAD was the last new computer
system Data General ever developed under its original name.</p>

<p>And here it is. Need your medications refilled? How’s that mucus
going? Is this the first and last time I’ll use the word “mucus” in a
classic computing blog? (Wanna bet?) The screen is nice and legible for
1999 (backlit 8” 640x480), the form factor is attractive, and the bright
blue handle gives it charm. It’s hard to say exactly why or what
physical cues tickled my brain, but even the mere appearance of it gives
off very strong health care vibes. Indeed, my wife, who’s worked in
several medical offices herself, asserted the very minute I unpacked it
that it was a clinical unit.</p>

The industrial design was contracted out to a Plainville, CT company
named Anderson Design Associates which built it to be durable and
survive a four-foot fall to hard flooring (I’m not going to test this!),
but also able to be tucked in against your hip with one hand so you
could use the stylus or keyboard with the other. (As she demonstrates.)
The device isn’t waterproof, but it has seals for fluid resistance, and
it can be cleaned and wiped with care. The handle has a divot to store a
stylus, but that seems to have been lost, so I just used a spare Belkin
Palm stylus I had on the shelf that also happens to fit.
<p>
<p>There were supposedly two versions of the WiiN-PAD, the first being
this basic slate, and then a larger unit called the WiiN-PAD MK with a
66-key splashproof cleanable membrane keyboard. I’ve never even seen
pictures of the keyboard variant.</p>

<p>But it turns out you don’t <em>need</em> the MK’s keyboard anyway:
you can dock it, and the dock has a PS/2 port to accept a full keyboard.
The dock is a sturdy metal job with feet for the desk. You’ll still need
a stylus for the screen (no mouse?), but when you’re at a desk you can
use it mostly like any PC. Pogo pins in the base of the dock connect to
the charging circuit in the slate and provide both power and keyboard

The back of the dock has the PS/2 port, the serial port (for syncing to
a PC to load apps and exchange documents, like any other Windows CE
device), and the barrel jack for the power supply. I don’t have the
original power supply for this, but the scrapper who found it (hat tip
to the
<a href="https://www.ebay.com/str/massivesurplus2014?_tab=2">Atlanta404Store</a>
on eBay, not affiliated, just satisfied) was able to start it up with a
center-positive AC laptop power supply set to 12 volts. Since my usual
multiadapter system didn’t generate enough watts for it, I bought an
off-the-shelf 12V/5A (60 watt) supply and that seems to be sufficient.
The jack looks like a 5.5/2.5mm barrel jack if I’m reading my calipers
right.
<p>
<p>The dock must be powered to use any external keyboard. The hole in
the back appears to be for putting in a spare battery; there are
contacts in the base and it’s about the right size. More about the
battery in a moment.</p>

<p>The WiiN-PAD has a single PCMCIA Type II slot, which in this unit is
flaky and does not reliably recognize cards (or sometimes makes the
machine freeze until the card is reinserted). I suspect this machine had
a bit of a hard life and I blame the port. I was able to work around it
for flash cards by worming a PC Card SD card adapter in and out until it
got to the point where the card was recognized but the machine didn’t
seize up. I could then pull the SD card out of the adapter instead of
the entire PC Card and have it reliably operate. However, it was very
hard to get other cards to work in it that way; after several attempts,
I decided I was likely just to do more damage and I never did get any of
the Ethernet cards working that worked with my other Windows CE 2
systems. There is no separate Compact Flash slot as is common in units
of this era but it does have an interesting compensation for that, which
I’ll show you when we get to the internals and demonstrate the machine
in operation.</p>

<p>Much was made about the WiiN-PAD’s wireless capabilities, but they
were only ever options. If installed, it could support old-school 2.4GHz
802.11 (not 802.11b) with WEP reportedly using a Proxim chipset. Just to
see if it would work, I also tried a Proxim <s>ORiiNOCO</s> ORiNOCO Gold
PCMCIA card I pulled from one of my PowerBooks and allegedly supported
by this version of WinCE, and nothing happened, though that could be the
port as well. As a poor substitute, this device actually has an RJ-11
modular jack for a 56K software modem which was also optional. The modem
got some use, too, so stay tuned.</p>

Here’s the rear of the unit with the doors off. Other than the battery,
the most visible landmark is a large centre-mounted monochrome
fixed-focus 640x480 camera. This camera can be triggered in compliant
applications using the blue pushbuttons and was intended to act as a
barcode reader for patient identification and medication administration.
However, it could also take primitive pictures and we’ll show it in
action. The blue buttons also work to reactivate the slate from sleep.
<p>
<p>Strangely, the model number applique on this unit has been cut off,
calling it the “Data General Model 53W.” This doesn’t match any DG SKU
system I know of and is probably incomplete (although according to the
dock sticker the WiiN-PAD’s official power supply is model SW173, so who
knows). It’s possible it was a pre-release unit, but it seems to have
all other production markings and a factory-generated UPC code and
serial number.</p>

<p>The battery slots into a very secure set of tabs and divots covered
by a door that’s lost its own tab and won’t stay on. The WiiN-PAD’s
power pack is blue like the handle, manufactured by JBRO and resembles a
regular lithium ion camcorder battery (7.2V, 1600mAh), but I can’t seem
to find a replacement that fits. Fortunately it still holds
<em>some</em> charge.</p>

Data General even patented the unit (6,144,552, applied for April 26,
1999), anticlimatically calling it a
“<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6144552A/en">handheld
computer system</a>.” This exploded diagram is from the published
patent, with the logic board marked as number 45. The wireless board, if
one were present, would be number 63.
<p>
<p>But as mentioned, it’s the chip it’s running that’s especially
unique. Since we have the rear doors off and we have some idea how it
all fits together, let’s crack it open and find the CPU, then talk a bit
about the processor and WinCE’s brief, practically unremembered support
for PowerPC.</p>

<p>The system is essentially a big plastic sandwich. The bottom of the
unit has two fat screws that hold it together. When these screws are
released, the case slots I’m holding together with my hand widen and the
bottom rubber bumper can be removed. These are part of the unit’s fluid
resistance, so be sure to reinstall the bumper’s tabs into those slots
when reassembling.</p>

<p>The handle comes off with two exposed centre screws and then two

you remove two more corner screws thus exposed, there are no other snaps

<p>The case is held together in part by the big black rubber bumpers
around the screen, which are sticky and also act as a partial fluid
seal. They are pressed into the mounts at back and hold with a friction
fit. The LCD inverter is at the top with the pogo contacts, microphone,
speaker and telephone jack on the bottom. We merely lift up the screen
carefully with its bumpers and rotate it towards us, mindful that it’s
connected in multiple places to the logic board.</p>

The logic board is also not particularly complicated, at least as
mainboards go. The most notable landmark is an M-Systems DiskOnChip
MD2200-D24 DIP in the lower right which was an early flash drive for
embedded systems introduced in 1995. They were very popular devices in
their time for their convenient form factors (here a 32-pin DIP) and
ease of implementation, which simply exposed an 8K window onto its
contents via memory-mapped I/O, while the module itself implements
internal wear leveling, bad block remapping and error correction. This
particular one is a 24MB part (though stay tuned). M-Systems was even
better known as the developers of the DiskOnKey in 2000, the first USB
flash drive and available in capacities from 8MB to 32MB, and SanDisk
bought them out in 2006.

<p>Although a sticker on the DOC says “programmed” (“Win Pad”?), and at
least part of the operating system appears to be on it, the DOC has a
more visible purpose to the user and we’ll get to what it does a bit
later. We also see a KM416S8030T-GL 16MB (2MB x 16-bit x 4-bank) DRAM
chip, an STLC7550 analogue front-end interface for the softmodem, a
MAXIM MAX148 which is probably used for the pen digitizer, and a MAXIM
MAX745EAP which controls the battery charger. The RAM and the modem chip
are clustered around what is obviously the backend of a large ball-grid

<p>Rather than try to dig out the board and turn it over, the other
alternative is to remove the PCMCIA card cage which is sitting on top of
it (this has a 1999 copyright date, which is interesting). The card cage
is held in by four tiny bolts with four tiny nuts sitting on four tiny
plastic standoffs, but the alternative was possibly snapping wires from
their solder points trying to free the board up inside the case, so the
cage option seemed less dangerous (and I could try reseating the cage to
see if that helped the card slot any — spoiler alert, it didn’t). We
carefully unscrew those nuts, cuss like a sailor when they fall into the
casing anyway, cuss some more when the standoffs do the same thing, and
then wedge the cage off its connector with a nylon spudger.</p>

After all that work, here we are: the CPU is a (somewhat scuffed, pretty
sure I didn’t do that) Motorola XPC821ZP50B3, a 50MHz MPC821, though
there are reasons later on to suspect that it’s been underclocked here.
Next to it is another 16MB DRAM chip and a ST M29W400T 512K flash chip
that contains the low-level system base. Now, to get those rotten little
standoffs back on.
<p>
<p>The MPC821 was part of Motorola’s first set of embedded PowerPC CPUs.
The PowerPC embedded line started with IBM’s 1994 PowerPC 403, nearly
contemporary with the mainstream 601/603/604, which had no FPU and only
later an optional MMU (both standard on the 6xx), running from 20 to
80MHz. These were ultra-low-end chips meant for limited duty in things
like set-top boxes and personal electronics. The 4xx series is still
manufactured today, primarily by AMCC, though IBM also offers
synthesizeable versions and a PowerPC 405 is embedded in every modern
POWER9 CPU (including the one I’m typing on) as the on-chip
controller.</p>

Motorola, as a manufacturing partner in the AIM alliance, got into the
PPC embedded world early too. Motorola already had a line of 68K
microcontrollers with a special communications procesosr on-chip called
QUICC (the 68360 and others), and adapted an expanded version of the
QUICC supporting Ethernet, serial and I2C into the 1995 MPC821 and
MPC860 PowerQUICC series, which initially ran up to 40MHz at 540mW. Both
chips carried a reduced PowerPC core with a peculiar MMU but no FPU, 12
lines of parallel I/O, 4K each of I/D cache, a DRAM controller and
PCMCIA support. However, although the 860 supported up to 7 serial
ports, the 821 supported 5 <em>and</em> an LCD controller, using system
memory as the framebuffer for resolutions up to 1024x1024 and a
256-colour palette. The communications processor in the PowerQUICC also
added a integer MAC (fused multiply-add) for DSP operations, though this
required a trip to the hardware and wasn’t part of the instruction set
(compare with the Toshiba R3900 core we saw in
<a href="/2022/12/magic-cap-from-magic-link-to-datarover.html">the
DataRover 840</a>). The 860 turned up in some surprising places like
Kodak’s high capacity DT90/DT91 print stations, but the 821’s onboard
LCD controller was very intentionally meant for personal devices. It was
accompanied slightly later by the cut-down MPC823, which replaced some
of the serial channels with USB, slashed the I/D caches to 1K and 2K,
and ran at 75MHz. (The diagram above is from <i>Microprocessor
Report</i>, May 10, 1993.)
<p>
The original Windows CE 1.0 in 1996 supported Hitachi SuperH
(SH-3/SH7708), MIPS R3000 (Philips PR31500, derived from the Toshiba
R3900) and MIPS R4000 (NEC VR4101) cores, though most of the devices
sold were SH-3 due to its higher performance. 1.0’s release was bumpy
for a variety of reasons and the devices’ form factor proved
controversial with reviewers. Motorola’s market failure with its own
personal devices line, notably the Magic Cap Envoy but also the
Newton-based Marco (both trademarks Motorola confusingly resurrected for
unrelated products later), caused them to lobby hard to port CE 1.0 to
the 821/823/860 and recoup their investment, though it was never
released.
<p>
Nevertheless, Microsoft hadn’t forgotten. For CE 2.0 in 1997, Microsoft
made the operating system more modular and substantially broadened the
architectures it supported, recognizing the plethora of embedded CPU
options that were flourishing then. In addition to SuperH (SH-3 but now
also SH-4), MIPS R3000 (Philips PR31500 but also Toshiba TX3912, both
using the same core, and the NEC VR3900) and R4000 (NEC VR4101, but also
VR4102 and VR4300), Microsoft added x86 support (486DX, Pentium and AMD
Élan SC400), ARM (720T and DEC StrongARM SA-1100) and finally the
PowerPC. For reasons unclear the 860 was excluded, though the core would
probably have worked; instead, it was intended for the MPC821 and MPC823
as well as the 33MHz IBM 403GC, the first of the 403 variants to have an
MMU.
<p>
Motorola produced evaluation boards for the 821 and 860 (the MBX821 and
MBX860 respectively) that vendors variously used as reference designs.
These boards could run Windows CE and Linux, Wind River Systems
supported VxWorks on it (which the Kodak devices used), and there was
even a partial port of (of course)
<a href="https://www.realtime.bc.ca/open-source/netbsd-mpc8xx.html">NetBSD</a>.
Other than that, however, both the 8xx and 403GC failed to achieve a
design win with any major Windows CE vendor, most likely due to the
other better supported options, and for years it was widely believed
there were <em>no</em> production PowerPC WinCE devices ever sold to
consumers — the only other mention I’ve seen was
<a href="https://www.securitysa.com/news.aspx?pklnewsid=1051">some sort
of modular controller</a> for a security system, though it doesn’t look
like that was released. Its presence on this board must have been a
surprise; Pen Computing, which is one of the few publications to even
mention the WiiN-PAD,
<a href="https://www.pencomputing.com/WinCE/HPC/hpcpro_vertical.html">didn’t
have any idea what its CPU was</a> at the time. (It also gives its specs
as “16-64MB” of RAM and “24-72MB” of flash, but this one has 32MB and
24MB respectively, and I don’t know if there were other configurations.)
It’s conceiveably possible that DG’s old contacts at Motorola after the
AViiON 88K debacle cut them a deal on 821 boards to make up for it, but
regardless of how it came to be, here we are.
<p>
Before we tour the system, it would be nicer to take some proper screen
grabs, maybe even run a benchmark. Unfortunately, though hardly
surprisingly, there’s almost <em>no</em> software available for PowerPC
Windows CE. I only found one package even
<a href="https://www.menasoft.com/blog/?p=32">offering a PowerPC
option</a>, but it turned out to require CE 3.0, and that particular
software package won’t help us anyway since we have no network right
now.
<p>
<p>So let’s build some basic apps of our own! I figured you never send a
PC to do a PowerPC’s job, and it only seemed right to build the
WiiN-PAD’s apps on my MDD G4 Power Mac running Windows 2000 under
Virtual PC in Mac OS 9.2.2. For this task I chose Windows CE Platform
Builder 2.11 because that was the easiest one for me to get my hands on
and it should generate compatible binaries with Windows CE 2.12.</p>

Success! We can write programs for it!
<p>
It’s worth looking at this file in detail since there aren’t very many
PowerPC CE binaries around, and this one is small enough to analyze
thoroughly. Notably, the executable is little-endian. No production
32-bit PowerPC was ever <em>truly</em> little endian and they instead
implemented a per-page mode that only applies to how memory is accessed,
analogous functionally to the way
<a href="/2020/09/hacking-gopher-client-into-alpha-micro.html">68K Alpha
Micro systems run little-endian</a> by swapping bus lines. (The absence
of this mode in the G5 was why Virtual PC, which depends on this
behaviour, didn’t work on the PowerPC 970 until it was rewritten.)
Windows NT, which ran on the mainline PowerPC 603 and 604 officially
from NT 3.51 through 4.0, also runs the CPU in this mode.
<p>
Nothing understands these binaries anymore, but we can still disassemble
them by building a trivial Portable Executable parser, extracting the
opcodes, and feeding them into something else to disassemble. It’s worth
noting that modern Power ISA chips starting with the POWER8 <em>do</em>
have a true little-endian mode, including the Raptor Talos II POWER9 I’m
typing this on, so we can keep the byte order the same, turn this into a
phony ELF binary, and have <tt>gdb</tt> act as the disassembler.

If you’re new to this instruction set, PowerPC has 32 general purpose
registers numbered <tt>r0</tt> through <tt>r31</tt>. <tt>r0</tt> has
unusual limitations on its use, where it sometimes acts like a zero
register (a la MIPS) and sometimes like an actual register, inspiring my
favourite
<a href="https://twitter.com/ppcinstructions/status/557938532401295360">joke
instruction <tt>mscdfr</tt></a> (“means something completely different
for <tt>r0</tt>”). As a result, most compilers only use it for specific
operations like getting values to and from special purpose registers and
so forth. In the incomparable
<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180806-00/?p=99425">Raymond
Chen’s multipart treatise on the PowerPC and Windows</a>, he
<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180815-00/?p=99495">mentions</a>
that the only thing the Microsoft compiler used <tt>r0</tt> for was
stashing the link register with the return address. Here, however, it
doesn’t seem to be used for anything at all: everything uses higher
registers, despite the fact they’ll need to be saved into the stack
frame because
<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180817-00/?p=99515">they’re
non-volatile</a>. <tt>r0</tt> never appears in the disassembly anywhere.
<p>
Another interesting thing about this binary is that the portion of the
function prologues that load and save those registers is actually
separate from the main block of code and come at the end, at least in
this unoptimized build. Those segments are called as subroutines, and
the individual function prologues jump into them at the right point to
load or save only the registers that need to be saved:

<p>Now, if we’re going to take a tour of this machine, we’d like to take
screenshots like we did for our MIPS R4000-based
<a href="/2022/09/the-mips-thinkpad-kind-of.html">“MIPS ThinkPad” IBM

screenshot program, Eiichiro Ito’s CaptCE, for which
<a href="https://github.com/EiichiroIto/WindowsCESoftware/tree/main/CaptCE">he
released the source code</a> under the MIT license (arigatō gozaimasu!).

<p>Before we do anything else, we need to fix the clock. On machines
where the battery has died, sometimes the residual time can reflect
<a href="/2023/01/saic-galaxy-1100-pre-cde-vue-of-pa-risc.html">when it
was last used</a>; if that’s so for this device, it can’t be later than
April 8, 2003. This machine came from the Atlanta, Georgia area based on
evidence I’ll demonstrate (and not just based on the seller), and
certain identifiers left on it trace it back to
<a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/meditech-acquires-patient-care-technologies">Patient
Care Technologies</a>, a home-care, hospice and telehealth software
provider. It’s not clear if this machine was actually in the field or
only used internally for testing. PtCT was bought by Meditech in
2007.</p>

<p>And here we are at the Windows CE desktop. Compared to other
contemporary WinCE systems like my WorkPad z50 and HP Jornada 690, the
desktop is rather spare, demonstrating only Microsoft Pocket Word, Inbox
(E-mail) and Internet Explorer. The Power Off shortcut is because the
Suspend option from the Start button doesn’t do anything, and this fault
I <em>do</em> blame on Data General. To resume from sleep, you press one
of the rear buttons. There are some additional applications in the Start
menu, however, and I’ll demonstrate those to you in good time.</p>

<p>Under My Computer we see a standard list of folders and devices you’d
expect from a WinCE 2.x system, but our DiskOnChip volume is
<em>also</em> exposed here. That’s the compensation for not having a
separate flash memory slot: the flash is built-in. Still, its presence
doesn’t seem nearly as convenient or useful as removable media would be,
and it was probably another deliberate choice to reduce cost and
eliminate another slot that could <s>cost money</s> get gunk in it.</p>

<p>When the WiiN-PAD is walking around, its primary data entry method is
via Jot, a screen-based system by Communications Intelligence
Corporation and seen on other CE devices. Jot is the arrow in the system
tray which you can tap to change modes, but the most straightforward way
is this on-screen keyboard app accessible from the Start menu that you
tap with the stylus. Most characters can be entered with it, including
special keyboard options for diacritics.</p>

<p>The other method is by writing on the display directly, like Palm
Graffiti. Jot does <em>not</em> use Graffiti strokes, probably to avoid
an infringement lawsuit, and this machine is not particularly fast at

horizontal.</p>

<p>… and, as its last mode, if you tap on that arrow it will put a
couple markers on the screen and allow you to write letters on the
entire display. This actually worked out the best for me,
<em>especially</em> because it prevents you from accidentally tapping
anything else until you turn it off. Still, docking it with the keyboard
is of course the most effective way of typing.</p>

<p>I’m not going to go into great detail on Inbox and Pocket Word except
to say they are present and appear to work. Pocket Word also did duty
for me as a simple plain-text editor, which is slightly overkill, but we
work with what we have. It defaults to “Pocket Word” (<tt>.pwd</tt>)
format, but is also capable of reading and writing <tt>.rtf</tt>,
<tt>.txt</tt> and <tt>.doc</tt> (Word 97). However, if you try to sync
your desktop documents to it, the synchronization process has certain
features it doesn’t support: although most but not all text formatting
is compatible, some effects like shadows are suppressed (though
retained) in Pocket Word, tables don’t always come through intact, and
headers, footers, footnotes, columns and style sheets are all
stripped.</p>

<p>The Internet Explorer option is the “IESample” minibrowser rather

you, the UPC code for it is indeed 9355 2806. However, it refused to

We saw the system information window before, but now that you know
there’s two 16MB DRAM chips onboard, it’s obnoxious we only get 25,044KB
of it. The rest of it is used by the 821, largely for the framebuffer.
(The “Vendor-Adapter” is the PC Card SD adapter.) Most of the available
RAM, but not an overwhelming majority, is allocated to storage by
default.
<p>
<p>None of this tells us how fast the CPU actually is, nor was I able to
easily see an obvious oscillator on the portions of the board I exposed.
Some operations seem slower than you’d expect from a 50MHz CPU,
especially with Motorola’s data sheet touting it as “a high-performance
embedded PowerPC core.” Their data sheet even quotes Dhrystone 2.1
benchmarks, alleging 66 VAX-MIPS at 50MHz. Let’s check that.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s C/C++ compiler seemed brain-damaged here (in particular
the preprocessor) and wouldn’t ignore parts of the timers file not meant
for Win32 even with the correct defines set. I ended up moving that
snippet over to the main code, as well as creating a stub
<tt>WinMain()</tt> that just calls into the main Dhrystone program. As
my systems here are MIPS R4K, SH-3 and PowerPC, I built optimized
versions for all three. The register option was selected.</p>

for Jupiter-class CE systems</a> including the WorkPad z50 here, a
133MHz NEC VR4121 (MIPS R4000). They reported a VAX-MIPS of 72.36; we
got 78.830 on 1.5 million runs. At about 9% variance, that puts us in

(SH-3). Pen Computing doesn’t report a VAX-MIPS in that table for the

expected score of 88.87 from the 66.82 showing of the LG Phenom Express
with a lower-clocked 100MHz SH7709A. Here we get 90.528 VAX-MIPS on 2

With those figures in mind, the WiiN-PAD is mush by comparison — 27.976
VAX-MIPS. That’s pretty bad, and way off from Motorola’s advertised 66,
even keeping in mind that figure was likely a marketing one under ideal
conditions. One possible explanation could be Microsoft’s compiler here
is worse on the PowerPC than it is for the (better and longer supported)
SuperH and MIPS families. We already know it generates somewhat unusual
code; although I wouldn’t think that the omission of <tt>r0</tt> would
cause a <em>massive</em> difference, that’s still one of the 32
registers it’s not using at all, and Dhrystone’s use of
<tt>register</tt> might make it more sensitive to it. Alternatively,
maybe there’s power-saving hardware or clock slewing or some such that
saps its performance, though it was plugged in and charging the entire
time.
<p>
A better theory, however, is that it’s simply not running at 50MHz. The
821 also comes in a 25MHz part, XPC821ZP25, and if it were downclocked
to 25MHz (33 VAX-MIPS) instead of 50MHz then that would be not too far
off our observed value (18%). Data General might just have been using a
50MHz part here because that’s what they could get and ran it slow for
power savings. Alternatively, if we do a straight scale we get a rate of
21.19MHz, which seems a little slow but not ridiculously so, or it could
be a combination of any of these factors. If I find a second one, it
would be interesting to see what it’s running as well — though I don’t
think I’ll run into another one of these anytime soon.
<p>
Overall, the WiiN-PAD appears well adapted to its purpose and one with a
wireless option would likely have made a very compelling clinical
device. The PS/2 docking feature is great, the case is well-designed and
the dock and hardware are robust. But it’s slow, it’s got obvious
(though not crippling) bugs, and even its built-in software suite is
meager — to say nothing of the fact that the only other software it can
run are the programs I wrote specifically for it. I’ll not ding it for
the PCMCIA issues, which are likely due to rough treatment, but
everything else are black eyes. Still, I like it. It’s cute and looks
good on a desk, it can do some useful work, and it’s very unlike many
other CE devices out there. I get more wear out of my WorkPad today, but
I certainly could have seen myself using this in 1999.
<p>
At any rate, let’s finish our story. The WiiN-PAD had existed for just a
handful of months before storage specialist EMC announced it was buying
Data General in August 1999 for US$1.1 billion (in 2024 dollars over
$2.05 billion). The price surprised industry observers somewhat, but not
the buyout itself: EMC was not only eliminating a competitor in storage
systems, they were also acquiring a mid-market storage product in
CLARiiON that their existing high-end Symmetrix line didn’t serve.
<p>
EMC was only interested in Data General’s storage systems, but the terms
of the buyout required them to maintain the AViiON line and not sell it
for at least two years. No such condition applied to any other division
of Data General, however, and EMC management swiftly shut down the
handheld line (and other units as well); the September 16, 1999 build
date for this unit’s ROM may well be the last update it got before it
was discontinued. Although there appears to have been some support for
PowerPC at least in initial releases of Windows CE 3.0, assuming that
single executable isn’t otherwise defective, Microsoft had already
eliminated PowerPC support for Windows 2000 and it definitely wasn’t
present in CE 4.0 or later. (Interestingly, the PowerPC-based Xbox 360
console used big-endian executables on a highly modified Windows 2000
kernel, the last gasp to date of Microsoft’s support for the
architecture.)
<p>
<p>As for the WiiN-PAD, I could find no record of new computer hardware
developed subsequently under the original Data General name nor any
company that produced any more of them, and it appears to truly have
been Data General’s last official computer system. The WiiN-PAD’s IP,
like most other components of the former Data General, is now part of
Dell after it bought EMC in 2016. Data General’s original
<tt>dg.com</tt> domain was subsequently snapped up by discount store
chain Dollar General, and the modern Data General trademark today is
owned by unrelated Spanish networking corporation Landatel who
<a href="https://datageneral.pro/en/data-general-origen/">purchased it
in 2023</a>.</p>

man who copiloted first nonstop flight around world dies at 85</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MEREDITH, New Hampshire — Burt Rutan was alarmed to see the plane he
had designed was so loaded with fuel that the wing tips started dragging
along the ground as it taxied down the runway. He grabbed the radio to
warn the pilot, his older brother Dick Rutan. But Dick never heard the
message. </p>
<p>Nine days and three minutes later, Dick, along with copilot Jeana
Yeager, completed one of the greatest milestones in aviation history:
the first round-the-world flight with no stops or refueling. </p>
<p>A decorated Vietnam War pilot, Dick Rutan died Friday evening at a
hospital in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, with Burt and other loved ones by his
side. He was 85. His friend Bill Whittle said he died of a severe lung
infection. </p>
<p>“He played an airplane like someone plays a grand piano,” said Burt
Rutan of his brother, who was often described as having a velvet arm
because of his smooth flying style. </p>
<p>A design, a dream</p>
<p>Burt Rutan said he had always loved designing airplanes and became
fascinated with the idea of a craft that could go clear around the
world. His brother was equally passionate about flying. The project took
six years. </p>
<p>There was plenty to worry Burt during testing of the light graphite
plane, Voyager. There were mechanical failures, any one of which would
have been disastrous over a distant ocean. When fully laden, the plane
couldn’t handle turbulence. And then there was the question of how the
pilots could endure such a long flight on so little sleep. But Burt said
his brother had an optimism about him that made them all believe. </p>
<p>“Dick never doubted whether my design would actually make it around,
with still some gas in the tank,” Burt Rutan said. </p>
<p>Voyager left from Edwards Air Force Base in California just after 8
a.m. on Dec. 14, 1986. Rutan said with all that fuel, the wings had only
inches of clearance. Dick couldn’t see when they started dragging on the
runway. But when Burt called on the radio, copilot Yeager gave a speed
report, drowning the message. </p>
<p>“And then, the velvet arm really came in,” Burt Rutan said. “And he
very slowly brought the stick back and the wings bent way up, some 30
feet at the wingtips, and it lifted off very smoothly.” </p>
<p>They arrived back to a hero’s welcome as thousands gathered to
witness the landing. Both Rutan brothers and Yeager were awarded a
Presidential Citizenship Medal by President Ronald Reagan, who described
how a local official in Thailand at first “refused to believe some
cockamamie story” about a plane flying around the world on a single tank
of gas. </p>
<p>“We had the freedom to pursue a dream, and that’s important,” Dick
Rutan said at the ceremony.  </p>
<p>A vet of combat missions</p>
<p>Richard Glenn Rutan was born in Loma Linda, California. He joined the
U.S. Air Force as a teenager and flew more than 300 combat missions
during the Vietnam War. </p>
<p>He was part of an elite group that would loiter over enemy
anti-aircraft positions for hours at a time. The missions had the call
sign “Misty” and Dick was known as “Misty Four-Zero.” Among the many
awards Dick received were the Silver Star and the Purple Heart. </p>
<p>He survived having to eject twice from planes, once when his F-100
Super Sabre was hit by enemy fire over Vietnam, and a second time when
he was stationed in England and the same type of plane had a mechanical
failure. He retired from the Air Force with the rank of lieutenant
colonel and went on to work as a test pilot. </p>
<p>Dick Rutan set another record in 2005 when he flew about 10 miles (16
kilometers) in a rocket-powered plane launched from the ground in
Mojave, California. It was also the first time U.S. mail had been
carried by a such a plane.</p>

id="ai-scams-could-become-growth-industry-of-all-time-warns-buffett">AI
scams could become ‘growth industry of all time,’ warns Buffett</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>omaha, nebraska — Warren Buffett cautioned the tens of thousands of
shareholders who packed an arena for his annual meeting that artificial
intelligence scams could become “the growth industry of all time.” </p>
<p>Doubling down on his cautionary words from last year, Buffett told
the throngs he recently came face to face with the downside of AI.
Someone made a fake video of Buffett, apparently convincing enough that
Buffett himself said he could imagine it tricking him into sending money
overseas. </p>
<p>The billionaire investing guru predicted scammers will seize on the
technology and may do more harm with it than good. </p>
<p>“It has enormous potential for good and enormous potential for harm
and I just don’t know how that plays out,” he said. </p>
<p>Earnings </p>
<p>The day started early Saturday with Berkshire Hathaway announcing a
steep drop in earnings as the paper value of its investments plummeted
and it pared its Apple holdings. The company reported a $12.7 billion
profit, or $8.825 per Class A share, in first the quarter, down 64% from
$35.5 billion, or $24,377 per A share a year ago. </p>
<p>But Buffett encourages investors to pay more attention to the
conglomerate’s operating earnings from the companies it owns. Those
jumped 39% to $11.222 billion, or $7,796.47 per Class A share, led by
insurance companies’ performance. </p>
<p>None of that got in the way of the fun. </p>
<p>Throngs flooded the arena to buy up Squishmallow plush toys of
Buffett and former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, who died last fall. The
event attracts investors from around the world and is unlike any other
company meeting. </p>
<p>“This is one of the best events in the world to learn about
investing. To learn from the gods of the industry,” said Akshay
Bhansali, who spent the better part of two days traveling from India to
Omaha. </p>
<p>A notable absence </p>
<p>Devotees come for tidbits of wisdom from Buffett, who famously dubbed
the meeting Woodstock for Capitalists. </p>
<p>This was the first meeting since Munger died. </p>
<p>The meeting opened with a video tribute highlighting some of his
best-known quotes, including classics like “If people weren’t so often
wrong, we wouldn’t be so rich.” The video also featured skits the
investors made with Hollywood stars over the years, including a
“Desperate Housewives” spoof where one of the women introduced Munger as
her boyfriend and another in which actress Jaimie Lee Curtis swooned
over him. </p>
<p>As the video ended, the arena erupted in a prolonged standing ovation
honoring Munger, whom Buffett called “the architect of Berkshire
Hathaway.” </p>
<p>Buffett said Munger remained curious about the world up until the end
of his life at 99, hosting dinner parties, meeting with people and
holding regular Zoom calls. </p>
<p>For decades, Munger and Buffett functioned as a classic comedy duo,
with Buffett offering lengthy setups to Munger’s witty one-liners. </p>
<p>Together, the pair transformed Berkshire from a floundering textile
mill into a massive conglomerate made up of a variety of interests, from
insurance companies such as Geico to BNSF railroad to several major
utilities and an assortment of other companies. </p>
<p>Next Gen leaders </p>
<p>Munger’s absence, however, created space for shareholders to get to
know better the two executives who directly oversee Berkshire’s
companies: Ajit Jain, who manages the insurance units; and Abel, who
handles everything else and has been named Buffett’s successor. The two
shared the main stage with Buffett this year. </p>
<p>The first time Buffett kicked a question to Greg Abel, he mistakenly
said “Charlie?” Abel shrugged off the mistake and dove into the
challenges utilities face from the increased risk of wildfires and some
regulators’ reluctance to let them collect a reasonable profit. </p>
<p>Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren said he believes Abel spoke up
more Saturday and let shareholders see some of the brilliance Berkshire
executives talk about. </p>
<p>A look to the future </p>
<p>Buffett has made clear that Abel will be Berkshire’s next CEO, but
said Saturday that he had changed his opinion on how the company’s
investment portfolio should be handled. He had previously said it would
fall to two investment managers who handle small chunks of the portfolio
now. On Saturday, Buffett endorsed Abel for the gig, as well as
overseeing the operating businesses and any acquisitions. </p>
<p>“He understands businesses extremely well, and if you understand
businesses, you understand common stocks,” Buffett said. Ultimately, it
will be up to the board to decide, but the billionaire said he might
come back and haunt them if they try to do it differently. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, the best applause line of the day was Buffett’s closing
remark: “I not only hope that you come next year but I hope that I come
next year.”</p>

<p>A neat property of the parquet file format is that it’s designed with
block I/O in mind, so that when you are interested in only parts of the
contents of a file, it’s possible to some extent to only read that data.
Many tools are aware of this property, and DuckDB is one of them.
Depending on which circles you run in, a lesser known aspect of HTTP is
range requests, where you specify which bytes in a file to be
retrieved.</p>

Here’s a quick halftone effect (i.e. a retro printed look) using CSS
with only one div at the minimum.
</p>
<p>
First of all, here’s a live demo:

</p>
<p>
To further illustrate the halftone effect, the following demo can vary
the <strong>size</strong> of the dots and the degree to which they
<strong>‘bleed’</strong>:

<input type="range" min="0.1" max="0.45" value="0.2" step="0.01" oninput="onInputHalftoneDemoBleed(event)">
</label>
<p>
There are several ways to do this in CSS. The above is a bit more
advanced with 2-3 extra divs. I’ll try to show a simple method, first.
</p>
<h2 id="halftone-basics">
Halftone basics
</h2>
<p>
To keep it simple, let’s start with a black-and-white image. It should
be easy to layer in additional colors with the same principle.
</p>

<p>
Actually, let’s start with a simpler image. A gradient, to illustrate
how halftone works in the first place.
</p>

</label><label> Bleed
<input type="range" min="0.1" max="2" value="1.5" step="0.01" oninput="onInputHalftoneDemoBleed(event)">
</label>
<p>
A
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone">halftone</a>
pattern is an array of ink dots simulating the appearance of smooth
gradiation of tones using just two pure tones (pure black ‘ink’ and pure
white background in this case). By varying the size of the dots, the
average ink coverage in a given area determines how light or dark the
tone is in that area.
</p>
<p>
Dots large enough would bleed into each other, creating the effect of
negative dots.
</p>
<h2 id="screen-and-threshold">
Screen and threshold
</h2>
<p>
Dot size and bleed can be emulated in one go using two simple image
processing operations, <strong>screen</strong> and
<strong>threshold</strong>.
</p>
<p>
The first step is to <em>screen</em> the source image (in this case, the
gradient) with a <em>blurry dot matrix pattern</em>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Screen</strong> is an operation that mixes the pixels of the
source image and the overlay image using some kind of an inverted
multiplication formula. Essentially, it <em>lightens lighter areas
multiplicatively</em>.
</p>
<p>
Because the dots are blurry (i.e. having feathered edges), the screen
operation gives us smaller-looking dots in lighter areas on the original
image and denser dots in darker areas.
</p>
<p>
This operation is done via CSS <code>mix-blend-mode: screen</code>.
</p>
<p>
The blurry dot pattern is generated using a <code>radial-gradient</code>
as a repeated <code>background-image</code>, like this:
</p>
<pre><code><span>background-image</span><span>:</span> <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span>14px at 50% 50%<span>,</span> black<span>,</span> white<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>background-size</span><span>:</span> 20px 20px<span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>
The next step is to <strong>threshold</strong> the resulting image. That
is, convert the image into pure black &amp; pure white pixels. Dark
pixels become fully black, and light pixels become white — according to
some defined threshold between light vs dark.
</p>
<p>
This creates the signature black-ink-matrix-on-white-paper look.
</p>
<p>
In CSS, there is no threshold filter, but it can be simulated by
applying an extremely high <strong>contrast</strong> filter, pushing
pixel values to the extremes of pure white and pure black. Effectively
the same result as thresholding. In code, that’s simply a <code>filter:
contrast(999)</code>.
</p>
<p>
Another thing we can add is a <strong>blur</strong> filter, <em>just
before</em> the thresholding operation. This emulates surface tension of
the ink, or something.
</p>
<p>
Let’s take a moment to look at the basic black-and-white solution so
far:
</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>halftone<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span>...</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<span><span><span>&lt;</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>
  <span>.halftone</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>position</span><span>:</span> relative<span>;</span>
    <span>/* brightness controls the threshold point */</span>
    <span>filter</span><span>:</span> <span>brightness</span><span>(</span>0.8<span>)</span> <span>blur</span><span>(</span>3px<span>)</span> <span>contrast</span><span>(</span>999<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>.halftone::after</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>position</span><span>:</span> absolute<span>;</span>
    <span>inset</span><span>:</span> 0<span>;</span>
    <span>background</span><span>:</span> <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span>10px at center<span>,</span> black<span>,</span> white<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>background-size</span><span>:</span> 20px 20px<span>;</span>
    <span>mix-blend-mode</span><span>:</span> screen<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<h2 id="colours-may-yeet-knowingly">
Colours may yeet knowingly
</h2>
<p>
When you get the black ink dots going, adding the rest of the colours is
easy. Just add a set of dots for each of CMY — cyan, magenta, and
yellow, the “primary colours” of ink — to complete the
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model">CMYK</a>!
Make sure to stagger the dots so they are distributed evenly. How to
stagger them well is left as an exercise to the dear reader, you (see
<a target="_blank" href="https://the-print-guide.blogspot.com/2009/05/halftone-screen-angles.html">halftone
angles</a>,
<a target="_blank" href="https://proofing.de/whats-moire-and-can-i-see-moire-in-a-proof/">moiré
patterns</a>, etc).
</p>
<pre><code><span>background</span><span>:</span>
  <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span>10px at center<span>,</span> #000<span>,</span> white<span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span>10px at ...<span>,</span> #0ff<span>,</span> white<span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span>10px at ...<span>,</span> #f0f<span>,</span> white<span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span>10px at ...<span>,</span> #ff0<span>,</span> white<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>
These additional layers will work just as well as black because the
<code>contrast</code> filter operates on each RGB channel independently.
The colours of cyan <span>(#0ff)</span>, magenta <span>(#f0f)</span>,
and yellow <span>(#ff0)</span> are at their own extremes in each RGB
channel, just like black (#000) and white (#fff). Thus, the
<code>contrast</code> filter produces a similar thresholding effect on
each colour in CMYK independently and simultaneously!
</p>
<p>
<span>Note: This is not a very accurate representation of halftone,
mainly due to the operations being in RGB, not CMY. An accurate
simulation would be to apply thresholding to each channel in some CMY
space via JS or maybe WebGL. But this shallow emulation may look good
enough in many cases.</span>
</p>
<p>
Here’s the result…?
</p>
<p><img srcset="/notes/pure-css-halftone/no-ink-mixing_628.generated.png 628w,/notes/pure-css-halftone/no-ink-mixing_664.generated.png 664w" sizes="not (min-width:664px) 628px, 664px" alt="halftone effect with only magenta dots visible" src="https://leanrada.com/notes/pure-css-halftone/no-ink-mixing.png?ref=rss" spec="100% [664) 664" loading="lazy" width="100%" height=""></p>
<p>
Only magenta is showing, because the magenta layer is the top layer in
that <code>background-image</code> list! The other layers are hidden
beneath the magenta layer. We need to combine these layers to see all
the colours.
</p>
<p>
In order to mix the four layers of ‘ink’ correctly, you must use the
<strong>multipy</strong> blend mode to simulate how inks mix together
(i.e. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_color">subtractive
colour mixing</a>).
</p>
<p>
Since we’re mixing <code>background-image</code>s together, we use this
property: <code>background-blend-mode: multiply</code>.

<p>
Aaand that’s it! A simple Halftone effect with a single div wrapper!
</p>
<p>
This simple filter is not very robust, so you may want to tailor the
brightness and saturation levels of the particular source image.
</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>halftone<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<p>
<span>A minor point, but the demo above actually uses two separate
overlay divs instead of a single div. This is to achieve better dot
staggering.</span>
</p>
<h2 id="variations">
Variations
</h2>
<p>
Notice anything wrong with the last image above? There’s a weird magenta
pattern on that flower petal. In fact, there are more magenta dots than
expected!
</p>
<p>
Apparently, the black dots were turning into the coloured ones. I think
the problem was that: <strong><span>coloured source image</span> ⊕ black
dot pattern = <span>coloured dots</span></strong>! <em>The symbol ⊕
represents the screen-threshold operation.</em> In other words, colour
is contagious!
</p>
<p>
What I did to fix this was separate the K layer (black) from CMY, and
have it use its own greyscale copy of the source image.
<strong>greyscale source image ⊕ black dot pattern = black
dots</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Here’s a vivid example where you can toggle the ‘separate-K’ version for
comparison purposes:
