from The Believer: An Interview with Annie Leibovitz</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: McSweeney’s Internet Tendency</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<a href="https://www.thebeliever.net/an-interview-with-annie-leibovitz/"><img src="https://edge.mcsw.net/mcsweeneys/yqdy50bnjtwy1lejf9wbehtjep0v" alt="" /></a><br />
“<i>When I started working for</i> Rolling Stone,<i> I really thought I
was doing journalism. And then I quickly realized I wasn’t, because I
had a point of view.</i>”
</p>
<div class="break">
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li><ul>
<li></div>
<p>
<i>In many ways, I am an unlikely choice of interviewer for a subject
like Annie Leibovitz. While I am trained as a photographer and still
utilize photography across my work, for the most part I no longer author
my own pictures. So I was skeptical when the call came: Were the editors
of </i>The Believer <i>sure they wanted me for the job? Wouldn’t the
magazine do better with someone more closely aligned with Leibovitz’s
work—straddling the art, reportage, and editorial worlds as it does? But
deep down I felt this request was tugging on my young self: As a
teenager growing up in 1990s Philadelphia, I obsessively collected
Leibovitz’s pictures from magazines, taping them up all over my walls,
such that the walls, in fact, disappeared under their many layers. Gap
ads,</i> Rolling Stone <i>magazine covers, and, most of all, pictures
from the “Got Milk?” campaign filled my little room by the hundreds. I
was, it might be noted, unaware that these were her pictures. At that
point, I didn’t know anything about who made the images I was obsessed
with, images I wanted to live with and inside. I had only my teenage
desires to guide me. And they propelled me toward her at full tilt.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Almost three decades later, on this occasion, I miraculously got the
chance to speak to Leibovitz, the person who had informed my own
burgeoning photographic consciousness, curiosity, and ambition. I once
heard someone say that we are all born with Beatles lyrics in our heads,
so deep is their creative mark on the world. The same might be said for
Leibovitz’s pictures (as evidenced by my own teenage image-collecting
pursuits): she has been making this work for so many decades, and with
such consistency, innovation, and panache, that it feels hard to imagine
the cultural landscape without her impression.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Leibovitz grew up in Connecticut in a large Jewish family; her father
was in the Air Force, and her mother was engaged in art and dance
(Leibovitz herself often refers to photographing as a kind of
choreography). After graduating from art school at the now-closed San
Francisco Art Institute—and living on a kibbutz in Israel for several
months—she quickly became the chief photographer for</i> Rolling Stone
<i>in 1973. Leibovitz has photographed at a wild pace ever since, making
some of the most iconic portraits of the twentieth and twenty-first
centuries: from John and Yoko in bed; to incarcerated people in Soledad
State Prison hugging family members; to a young Whoopi Goldberg in a
bathtub full of milk; to Demi Moore, nude and pregnant, on the cover
of</i> Vanity Fair. <i>In addition to regularly shooting covers and
features for that magazine and</i> Vogue, <i>Leibovitz has had
exhibitions at the Brooklyn Museum, Crystal Bridges Museum of American
Art, and the National Portrait Gallery.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Our conversation unfolded over Zoom on a warm October morning (I was
in the Midwest, and Leibowitz was in New York City), and after a handful
of rescheduling emails. It centered on artistic process—sketching,
editing, and more—while also delving into her new show at Hauser &amp;
Wirth, titled Stream of Consciousness. The show includes seventy images,
from throughout her career, and largely centers creative thinkers and
makers as subjects. We also discussed my work—a surprise to me!—with
regard to my use of archival photography and how we relate to images in
relation. We talked about Leibovitz’s decision not to publish pictures
of her children, attending synagogue, camera phones, photographing
Kamala Harris in the final weeks of the 2024 presidential campaign, and
why she feels photojournalism is the most exciting work happening in the
field.

class="caps">HOCKNEY</span>
</h2>
<p>
<span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">BELIEVER</span>: Ready
to start?
</p>
<p>
<span class="caps">ANNIE</span> <span class="caps">LEIBOVITZ</span>: Let
me get some water here. I just drove in at six o’clock this morning from
upstate, so I’m a little bit…
</p>
<p>
<span class="caps">BLVR</span>: Tired?
</p>
<p>
AL: And then I had a call with these publishers; my rabbi, Rabbi
[Angela] Buchdahl, needs a photograph, so it was great to have a
conversation with her publishers about what they would like to do.
</p>
<p>
<span class="caps">BLVR</span>: What temple do you go to?
</p>
<p>
AL: Central Synagogue [in New York City]. My three daughters were all
bat mitzvahed there.
</p>
<p>
<span class="caps">BLVR</span>: How nice—and that you are photographing
your rabbi too.
</p>
<p>
AL: She is an extraordinary woman. You know, she’s Korean American,
actually. Her sermons are quite extraordinary. I mean, the only reason
I’m still at this synagogue is because of her. You look forward to her,
to what she’s going to say. Where do you live now?
</p>
<p>
<span class="caps">BLVR</span>: I live in Columbus, Ohio.
</p>
<p>
AL: I read about you, and that was part of the reason I put the
interview off. I went, Oh shit. She’s serious. She’s fucking serious.
</p>
<p>
<span class="caps">BLVR</span>: You’re giving me too much credit, I
think.
</p>
<p>
AL: No, no, no. You are a serious artist, and, you know, I crawled into
bed the night before and started to do my due diligence, and I called
[my studio manager] Karen Mulligan. I said, “I can’t do this tomorrow
morning. First of all, she’s too serious.” I mean, I think it’s
interesting what you’re doing, the way you’re using photography.
</p>
<p>
<span class="caps">BLVR</span>: I appreciate that. I’ll carry it with
me.
</p>
<p>
AL: Certainly. The older I get, and with the accumulation of the work I
have, it is so interesting to see the relationships between the
photographs. That’s kind of what I’m interested in in the show I’m
having at Hauser &amp; Wirth. The gallery world, it’s such a strange
animal, you know?
</p>
<p>
<span class="caps">BLVR</span>: I have questions for you about this, so
don’t get too far ahead of me! But first, I want to ask you about
photographing such famous subjects. These are people that are used to
being photographed; I imagine that makes your job both easier and
harder. How does your process differ, if at all, from photographing
noncelebrities?
</p>
<p>
AL: I mean, I’ve been doing this, what, fifty years. It started with
journalism. Or what I thought was journalism. I admired the photo story,
you know? When I started working for <i>Rolling Stone</i>, I really
thought I was doing journalism. And then I quickly realized I wasn’t,
because I had a point of view. I found that my work was stronger if I
went with that point of view. So the work evolved. It started with these
incredible years at <i>Rolling Stone</i>. When I look at that work, I
see a young, insane, obsessed photographer. Just, you know,
photographing everything in front of me, never going home, really just
working all the time. It was a great school for observation and learning
and becoming a better photographer. <i>Rolling Stone</i> and I grew up
together, and eventually, with the magazine, I began learning how to
photograph people. Coming from that place, it was very awkward making
portraits at first, because you had an… appointment with someone. It
wasn’t as fluid as just being able to be around and watching something
evolve or happen.
</p>
<p>
So what happened? My subjects were sitting for photographs, and I became
a little bit more inventive and conceptual. I had a whole slew of very,
very conceptual years. Of course, there’s no going back after you start
working like that. Now I’m kind of like a dinosaur when it comes to what
I do, which is sort of a sitting portrait. I became very aware of what
it is I am doing, and feel very responsible to it—to sitting photograph.
I’m very interested in it and how to make it work.
</p>
<p>
As for working with people who are very, very famous and aren’t very
famous, I think you’ll see, if you look through all my work, that it’s a
mixture. Also, in a lot of the work, I photograph people who aren’t
famous yet, and then they’re suddenly famous. When I did Whoopi Goldberg
[in 1984], she was unknown. I just went to her apartment in Berkeley and
photographed her there. So I’m just saying, these people sometimes
become famous after the fact.
</p>
<p>
<span class="caps">BLVR</span>: It’s interesting: The way I set up that
initial question was sort of a way to ask, What is it like to photograph
famous subjects versus non-famous ones? But what I heard in your answer
was a far more interesting distinction: between photojournalism and
portraiture.
</p>
<p>
AL: Yes, yes. The reality is that I love photography—every part of it.
There are so many ways to use photography. I mean, it’s so big. I never
wanted to be pinned down to one kind of style or work. I have a huge
photography book collection. I have a few photographs that I own, Robert
Frank and Cartier-Bresson, and people I grew up on whose work I loved.
</p>
<p>
I just went to a Carrie Mae Weems show up at Bard [College], and I
couldn’t believe it. To go through every single room and see how she
used photography—it was just stunning to me to see the breadth of her
ideas. I remember seeing her very early work, with the kitchen
photographs [the <i>Kitchen Table Series</i>, 1990], and thinking, Oh my
gosh, here goes art photography, whatever it is. But art photography
always has been interesting, quite honestly. Hockney was the first
person to do it, when he did his study on perspective. I remember being
weak in the knees, thinking, That’s how the eye sees—the way he collaged
his pictures together. I was so frustrated with the frame of the camera
then—that everything had to be in that frame. We learned with
Cartier-Bresson and Robert Frank to compose in that rectangle, and to
use the whole negative. But now it’s so wide open, and it’s so
interesting, and it’s such a great medium. It deserves to be, and it is,
now, taken seriously. It is art. It’s great to live through all that.

About Time Our Government Finally Reflects the Real America—An Airport
Terminal at 10 a.m. on a Weekday</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: McSweeney’s Internet Tendency</p>
<p>
Finally, and not a moment too soon, our government will look, smell, and
act like the <i>real</i> America. Not an Ivy League college campus, not
a melting pot of immigrants striving to achieve the American dream, but
instead an endlessly replenishing stream of shout-talking men outraged
that people with disabilities or families with children who are offered
extra assistance actually take it, along with a steady diet of morning
beers, explosive rage, and ketchup.
</p>
<p>
It’s far past time for those who “govern” to demonstrate the same lack
of awareness as everyone pretending not to know what boarding group
they’re in. And why did we win January 6 if not for the right to berate
underpaid service workers who aren’t allowed to unionize and also so we
can have both pizza and tequila shots for breakfast? Why was 9/11 an
inside job if not for our hard-won ability to wear pajama bottoms and
inflatable neck pillows in public and constantly have to relearn through
the application of loud buzzing sounds and shame that jewelry is made of
metal? And what was the whole point of all those genocides if not to
have unlimited access to themed socks and overpriced regional T-shirts?
</p>
<p>
Why did we win some wars if not to one day step on a slow-moving rubbery
walkway that will just bring us to a place in the small distance that’s
not even better, just a little bit closer to the end? Why did we violate
a whole bunch of human rights stuff if not to look down on anyone who
doesn’t have <span class="caps">TSA</span> pre-check as well as those
who do? What is the point of taking over Greenland and the Panama Canal?
</p>
<p>
I’m genuinely asking.
</p>
<p>
What is our military fighting for other than to one day have access to
basic health care, suicide prevention, addiction treatment, <span
class="caps">PTSD</span> treatment, disability assistance, financial
stability, mental health services, homelessness prevention, treatment
for military sexual trauma, and thorough investigations into the toxins,
trauma, and brain injuries suffered during their service to our country,
and I totally forgot the point I was trying to make.
</p>
<p>
Right, the point is, it’s far past time for the physical and behavioral
aspects of our government, not to mention the basic filth level and
daily aromatic je ne sais quois to more closely reflect the combination
<i>Wolf of Wall Street</i> / itinerant carnival / Klan rally that is now
the actual true American experience. Join us at gate D4, now E24, now
B28, now A287—whoops, now back to D4 via a shuttle and infrastructure
constructed in a previous century. Come jump into a sauce packet of
patriotism, get ready to guzzle the cloying artificial syrup of
selfishness, and crack open a can of frozen concentrate brimming with
public toenail clippings, open-mouth coughing, and watching marriages
unravel before your eyes.
</p>
<p>
Do you smell that? That’s freedom. Also, caramel corn and farts.
</p>
<p>
Real democracy is now ready to board. Are you a <i>real</i> American or
not? Do you not have the slightest clue how to go through security after
twenty-four fucking years? Are you just waiting for someone to act up so
you can duct tape them to their seat? Do you hear that other people have
tight connections, and if we all just sat down and gave them time to
grab their bags and deboard first, they might have a chance of making
their connections and think, “Fuck that shit”? Are you itching to ask
every non-white person you see where they’re really from, and so help
you god, if they answer “Kansas,” you will seriously lose it? And do you
often think about how there doesn’t seem to be nearly enough exit rows
for everyone who wants out?
</p>
<p>
May God and air traffic control bless our new president, because
obviously the billionaires already have. And may someone—truly we’ve
proven we’ll take literally anyone—bless the United States of America, a
country that has never been more terminal, where the skies have never
been less friendly, where you are not free to get up and move across
state borders with that uterus of yours, and where the doors are
definitely about to fall off.

Pre-Game Pep Talk by a College Football Coach Who Recently Audited a
Class on Nietzschean Thought</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: McSweeney’s Internet Tendency</p>
<p>
Team, tonight we play the biggest game of our lives. I know you have
heard our opposing coach’s comments—“We’re doing everything we can to
honor our creator.” I also know you saw last week when their star
quarterback took a knee and grabbed the sideline reporter’s microphone
so the world could hear his prayer:
</p>
<p style="padding-left:2em;">
<i>Our father, who art in heaven<br /> I throw this ball for you<br />
Please grant me touchdowns<br /> And deliver me from interceptions<br />
All glory to you, God<br /> And to State, the greatest team in your
creation<br /> Amen.</i>
</p>
<p>
Now, you’re probably thinking, “This ain’t good, Coach. They’re
convinced they have the Almighty on their side. If that’s true, what
chance do we have? How are we going to beat both State <i>and</i> the
God of Western Christianity?”
</p>
<p>
Well, men, I recently completed my audit of <span
class="caps">PHIL</span> 332: Nietzsche &amp; The Death of Practical
Meaning, and I’m tired of mincing words.
</p>
<p>
Their God is dead.
</p>
<p>
Time of death: tonight.
</p>
<p>
Place of death: Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia.
</p>
<p>
Causes of death: the ceaseless march of modernity, the dawn of an age of
existential crises, the fatal annoyance of having to endlessly answer
the prayers of State’s performatively evangelical offensive linemen, and
our explosive passing attack.
</p>
<p>
When we take the field, we will do what we know how to do. We are going
to get pressure on the quarterback. We are going to execute great
downfield blocking. And we are going to show State University that
Christian morality is by no means self-evident.
</p>
<p>
We will engage State in a practical philosophical thought experiment
that proves an unblocked corner blitz can shatter the idea of God. We
will offer definitive evidence that no man has the moral high ground in
a two-minute drill. We will teach our gospel: the gospel of deep
crossing routes that break the necessary assumptions of Christianity,
leaving State’s hands grasping at air, empty and faithless.
</p>
<p>
Come halftime, State’s coach will stare dead-eyed into the camera, a man
whose table has lost three of its four legs. Holly Rowe will ask him,
“Coach, what adjustments will help your team get back on track?”
</p>
<p>
He will respond in a whisper: “They are die Übermenschen.”
</p>
<p>
We are the Overmen, the Supermen, the dadgum Tech Cougars, those who
have crossed from mindless acceptance to a world of self-directed,
restless solitude in pursuit of a grounded human ideal.
</p>
<p>
Our opponent lives, though they do not yet know it, in the twilight of
their idols—specifically, the false idols of ground-and-pound,
line-of-scrimmage-obsessed football. We require no idols. We have been
reborn via our newly installed flea flicker, which reflects our belief
in the quintessence of man. We require no moral code. Our defensive
coordinator is neither good nor evil. Three-man front or four-man front?
Neither and both. We are beyond scheme. Our opponent will live in an
infinite loop of eternal recurrence, an unchanging eternity of us
Cougars gaining first downs on jet sweeps forever.
</p>
<p>
We do know that our victory will be meaningless. As soon as it is over,
it will mean no more than the act of eating an English muffin at the
team buffet. Our win will be as worthless as the paper money society has
denominated as value, although it is valueless. Our “National Title”
will be as meaningful as the drunkard’s boast that he is heir to the
throne of England. Because he is, and he is not, just as we are, and we
are not.
</p>
<p>
Yet this does not change what we do tonight.
</p>
<p>
Tonight, we won’t rely on faith or intelligent design. Tonight, we won’t
pray for victory. Tonight, we won’t supplicate to a higher power. No,
tonight, we are accountable for what happens, and what is going to
happen is that we are going to kick State’s ass up and down the field.
</p>
<p>
We will score touchdowns and have the player who scored lie down while
the rest of us pantomime throwing dirt on him, representing the burial
of the ancient gods, now sacrificed to progress, science, and our air
raid passing offense.
</p>
<p>
We will play clean in coverage, bat passes down, point toward the
heavens, and then point at our butts, indicating that their dead God is
butt at football.
</p>
<p>
We will stand victorious at the podium with Holly Rowe. She will ask us
how we feel, and we will say, without embarrassment, that we feel as
gods must feel. That WE <span class="caps">ARE</span> gods. The Gods of
Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia.
</p>
<p>
Hands in, gentlemen. Clear eyes, full hearts, Zarathustra can’t lose.
</p>
