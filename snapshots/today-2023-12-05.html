<p class="drop-caps">
The rules governing virtually all of the remaining policies in President
Joe Biden’s climate law — including some of its most important and
generous provisions — will come out in the next several weeks, signaling
a new era in the law’s implementation, a senior White House advisor told
Heatmap in an exclusive interview.
</p>
<p>
Speaking on the sidelines of the United Nations climate conference in
Dubai, the advisor John Podesta said that the Treasury Department will
publish rules governing some of the law’s biggest remaining subsidies by
the end of the year. The former White House chief of staff and veteran
political strategist also offered a window into his thinking about the
implementation of the policies, which he has been charged with
overseeing since last year.
</p>
<p>
The upcoming subsidies include some of the most important tax credits in
the law. They are aimed at boosting climate-friendly aviation fuel,
low-carbon hydrogen, and new factories building EVs and other
clean-energy equipment. Podesta said that guidance for all three tax
credits will be published by the end of the year. When they are
released, every active subsidy in the Inflation Reduction Act will be
usable and open for business.

Podesta has spent much of the past year immersed in the tax code, the
site of many of the law’s most sweeping policies. On Sunday, he walked
Heatmap through his thought process behind some of the biggest
unreleased rules.
</p>
<p>
He expressed particular worry about the rules governing “green
hydrogen,” which is produced by using electricity to separate water into
oxygen and hydrogen.
</p>
<p>
“This has been the most challenging piece of policy that we’ve had to
contend with” while implementing the IRA, Podesta said.
</p>
<p>
Many energy scholars believe that hydrogen, which produces no climate
pollution when burned, could potentially replace fossil fuels in many
sectors. But the IRA’s tax credit is so generous — providing companies
with up to $3 for every kilogram of hydrogen produced — that some
experts have argued that exceptionally strong rules must govern it, so
as to make sure it actually serves to reduce emissions.
</p>
<p>
Hydrogen “has the potential to pay enormous dividends in 2030 and 2040
in reducing emissions from the industrial sector, from heavy duty
transportation, et cetera,” Podesta said. “But at the same time, not do
it in a way that lacks environmental integrity.”
</p>
<p>
He described the White House’s work as trying to balance between two bad
outcomes: On the one hand, it could stifle the production of green
hydrogen so much that “blue hydrogen,” produced using natural gas and
carbon capture technology, dominates; on the other, it could boost green
hydrogen so much that it distorts electricity markets nationwide.
</p>
<p>
“We could kind of blow it in either direction, I think,” Podesta said.
“We can either be in a context in which we’re not really driving
deployment, and therefore driving innovation, particularly on the
electrolyzer side, so that we end up kind of filling the gap with a lot
of blue hydrogen rather than green hydrogen. On the other hand, if we go
the other way, we sort of blow emissions on the grid.”
</p>
<p>
The big question confronting the Treasury Department is
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-treasury" target="_self">how
to measure climate pollution produced from the electricity</a> used to
create green hydrogen. One sticking point is whether hydrogen producers
will be allowed to buy power from existing zero-carbon power plants,
like
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/the-nuclear-hydrogen-conundrum" target="_self">nuclear
power plants</a> and hydroelectric dams. That could be a boon for
Constellation Energy, the country’s largest owner of nuclear facilities.
</p>
<p>
But researchers at
<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/acacb5" target="_blank">Princeton</a>
and
<a href="https://energy.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/MITEI-WP-2023-02.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MIT</a>
have argued that if hydrogen companies aren’t required to bring
<em>new</em> clean energy resources onto the grid to account for the
power that they’re using to make hydrogen, then they will inadvertently
increase climate pollution. That is because if a nuclear reactor stops
serving homes and businesses and starts powering hydrogen production,
then natural gas and coal plants will likely produce electricity to fill
the gap, at least in the near term.
</p>
<p>
“You could see a world where all of the U.S. nukes pivot to supplying
electrolyzers and just print money that way,” Dan Esposito, a policy
analyst at the think tank
<a href="https://energyinnovation.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Energy
Innovation</a>,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/the-nuclear-hydrogen-conundrum" target="_self">told
Heatmap</a> earlier this year. “There’s just a lot of layers to how bad
this can get.”
</p>
<p>
But speaking in Dubai, Podesta appeared to reject some of these more
extreme scenarios.
</p>
<p>
“I think a lot of the model runs just have assumptions that are very,
very — you know,” Podesta said. “Like, all nuclear power plants are not
going to stop sending power to the grid and start making hydrogen. That
is not going to happen. I guarantee you that.”
</p>
<p>
“So you can have an upside estimate of what that means, but to what
end?” he added. “It’s tricky, because the [hydrogen] industry
essentially does not exist. So we’re making judgment calls about what we
need to do to get the green side of the industry really going, in this
decade.”
</p>
<p>
Podesta was more sanguine about the other two tax credits. “We’ve got a
game plan on [the sustainable aviation fuel tax credit], and I think
it’s going to be fine,” he said, although he added that it would
require<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/bioenergy/articles/greet-greenhouse-gases-regulated-emissions-and-energy-use-transportation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
updating a key Department of Energy model</a> that governs the policy.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll be able to both stimulate production but also create
environmental integrity in that program,” he said.
</p>
<p>
That policy is expected in the middle of December.
<a href="https://irc.bloombergtax.com/public/uscode/doc/irc/section_45x" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The
last remaining tax credit</a>, which will subsidize new factories in
America to build clean-energy equipment, will be out next week, a
Treasury Department spokesperson told Heatmap.
</p>
<p>
Once rules are written for those three programs, virtually all of the
active subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act will be ready to use.
The IRA contains another set of subsidies — “technology-neutral” tax
credits that will boost zero-carbon power generation until the country
hits certain decarbonization goals — that the Treasury Department has
not yet written rules for. But that program will not go into effect
until 2025.
</p>
<p>
Starting on January 1, a new era will begin in the law’s implementation,
as the government moves to award the climate law’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/inflation-reduction-act-grants-funding" target="_self">more
than $100 billion in grants</a>, Podesta said. “It’s going from, ‘This
money is available, please apply,’ to, ‘Here’s the money, go put it to
work,’” Podesta said.
</p>
<p>
In the spring, the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund — a new $27 billion
in-house investment fund created at the Environmental Protection Agency
— will begin distributing its funding, he added.
</p>
<p>
“I think that could be very, very powerful and important, not just from
the perspective of reducing costs for consumers and reducing emissions,
but in terms of the goal of deploying against the justice part of the
president’s agenda,” he said. “That’s really where you can see the
community impact happen.”

<li>COP28 President Defends Himself Following Controversial Comments
</h3>
<p>
COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber responded to critics on Monday,
insisting that he and the UAE “very much believe and respect the
science” after <em>The Guardian</em> published a video of him
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop28-cybertruck-attack-methane-contrail" target="_self">pooh-poohing
the phase-out of fossil fuels</a> in an online event that took place
ahead of the summit. “I have always been very clear on the fact that we
are making sure that everything we do is centered around the science,”
Al Jaber, who is also the chief executive of the UAE’s state oil company
Adnoc, went on. “We did not in any way underestimate or undermine the
task at hand.”
</p>
<p>
Al Jaber’s ability to lead the climate summit had been called into
question after the publication of the comments on Sunday, which he says
were
<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/cop28-sultan-al-jaber-climate-science-b2457966.html" target="_blank">taken
out of context</a>. Some critics, however, remain unappeased. In an
interview Monday, former Vice President Al Gore
<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/al-gore-blasts-cop28-climate-chief-and-oil-companies-emissions-pledges" target="_blank">called</a>
Al Jaber “a smart guy … [but] when I look at the massive expansion plan
that they have to increase their production of oil [after the
conference] … do you take us for his fools?”

<a href="https://newslink.reuters.com/public/33569873" target="_blank">the

<li>Report: The Greenhouse Effect of CO2 Gets Worse the More There Is
</h3>
<p>
Carbon dioxide becomes a “more potent greenhouse gas” the more it
accumulates in the atmosphere, a
<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq6872?utm_source=sfmc&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ScienceAdviser&utm_content=distillation&et_rid=1003448393&et_cid=5012460" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new
study</a> published in <em>Science</em> found. Previously, the strength
of the greenhouse gas effect of CO2 was thought to scale linearly,
<em>Science</em> writes. Overall, the paper
<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq6872?utm_source=sfmc&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ScienceAdviser&utm_content=distillation&et_rid=1003448393&et_cid=5012460" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a>
that “doubling the atmospheric CO2 concentration increased the impact of
any given increase in CO2 by about 25%,” thanks to the gas’s effect on
the stratosphere.
</p>
<p>
While that would imply the planet will heat at an increasingly rapid
rate, the report wasn’t all bad news. “[T]hough this effect means that
the carbon dioxide added to the air now leads to more warming than it
would have a century ago,” writes <em>Science</em>, “it also means that
geoengineering schemes to release sunlight-reflecting particles could be
more effective than thought by heating the stratosphere and reducing
CO2’s strength.”

<li>There Are Now Enough Voters Who Prioritize Climate to Swing Key
Elections
</h3>
<p>
There are enough voters who prioritize climate issues to potentially
swing elections in certain key states, a new 18-state study by the
Environmental Voter Project (EVP) has found. It’s not just young voters
(ages 18-34) doing the heavy lifting on climate and environment at the
ballot box, either; voters who are 65 and older were second to young
voters with regards to prioritizing green political issues, with one in
six listing “climate change” or “clean air, clean water, and the
environment” as their #1 issue.
</p>
<p>
This is significant, because in states like New Mexico, for example, EVP
found that one-third of older voters prioritize climate. And just next
door, “EVP identified 230,000 climate voters 65 or older in Arizona, a
state where the presidential race was decided by 10,500 votes in 2020,”

Internet Enabled Mass Surveillance. AI Will Enable Mass Spying.</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-05, updated: 2023-12-05, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Spying and surveillance are different but related things. If I hired a
private detective to spy on you, that detective could hide a bug in your
home or car, tap your phone, and listen to what you said. At the end, I
would get a report of all the conversations you had and the contents of
those conversations. If I hired that same private detective to put you
under surveillance, I would get a different report: where you went, whom
you talked to, what you purchased, what you did.
</p>
<p>
Before the internet, putting someone under surveillance was expensive
and time-consuming. You had to manually follow someone around, noting
where they went, whom they talked to, what they purchased, what they
did, and what they read. That world is forever gone. Our phones track
our locations. Credit cards track our purchases. Apps track whom we talk
to, and e-readers know what we read. Computers collect data about what
we’re doing on them, and as both storage and processing have become
cheaper, that data is increasingly saved and used. What was manual and
individual has become bulk and mass. Surveillance has …

<p>
One block of Detroit’s hip Corktown neighborhood is now the home to the
<a href="https://michigancentral.com/mdot-city-of-detroit-and-electreon-unveil-nations-first-public-ev-charging-roadway-at-michigan-central/" target="_blank">nation’s
first inductive charging roadway</a>, allowing specially-equipped
vehicles to charge while on the move.
</p>
<p>
The electric road system is being deployed two years after Michigan
Governor Gretchen Whitmer announced the pilot program. A joint project
between the state’s Department of Transportation, Detroit, and the
company that developed and installed the technology,
<a href="https://electreon.com/" target="_blank">Electreon</a>, the
quarter-mile stretch of road is packed with copper coils that allow EVs
equipped with Electreon’s magnetic receivers to wirelessly charge while
driving, idling, or parked. Just as importantly, it’s safe for
pedestrians, animals, and other vehicles.
</p>
<p>
The stretch of 14th Street the city picked for the test was also no
accident; it’s directly in front of Michigan Central, Detroit’s
innovation and technology hub that includes everything from autonomous
vehicle developers to drone deployments. The symbolism is obvious.
</p>
<p>
Yet Electreon — a company that has partnered with other cities in
<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221215005176/en/Germany%E2%80%99s-First-Public-Project-for-Wireless-Charging-of-Electric-Vehicles-Has-Started" target="_blank">Europe</a>
and its home country of Israel — might be interested in the area for
more practical reasons. It’s just really hard to maintain roads in
Michigan.
</p>
<p>
Concrete and pavement is pummeled year-round with excessive moisture
that seeps into cracks, contracting and expanding to break apart roads
from the inside. And that’s before you throw in metro traffic, tractor
trailers, and the thousands of pounds of salt scattered on the road that
keeps ice at bay and accelerates rust.
</p>
<p>
If that sounds like an awful place to test copper-embedded roadways and
external magnetic receivers, maybe that’s the point. If wireless
charging can make it in Detroit, it can make it anywhere.

and were recently discontinued, in 2022, with similar fanfare. It was a
sad day for me, a lover of abstraction-breaking technologies, but it was
forseeable and understandable. At the time of Optane’s launch, a lot of
us were excited about the idea of having a new storage tier, sitting
between DRAM and flash. It was announced as having DRAM endurance and
speed with the persistence and size of flash. It was a futuristic memory
technology, but the technology of the future met the full force of
Wright’s Law. ↫ Nima Badizadegan I definitely remember Optane being
presented as a huge deal, but it seems it fell between the cracks of
other technologies developing around it and their prices dropping

vicious legal threats against critics (including me!) to maintain a
squeaky-clean image, the Sackler name is finally a synonym for mass
murder, and will forever be a curse. But though they lost their name,
they kept their billions. In so doing, the Sacklers exposed the rot at
the heart of American bankruptcy, bringing an obscure, deeply corrupt
system into the public eye. Bankruptcy has always been with us. As
Michael Hudson reminds us, “Debts that can’t be paid, won’t be paid.”
Without some system for discharging debt, control over the entire
productive capacity of a society is eventually shifted to a hereditary
creditor class, which precipitates calamity:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/08/jubilant/#construire-des-passerelles
But America has a bifurcated bankruptcy system. For normal people,
bankruptcy is more punishment than relief. For the ultra-wealthy,
bankruptcy is a system of total impunity for ghastly crimes. Simply
undertake those crimes through the “personage” of an LLC and you’re on
easy street:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/09/bankruptcy-protects-fake-people-brutalizes-real-ones/
(This is America, so of course there’s a racial dimension to
punishment-by-bankruptcy. Broke white people are funneled into quick
means of discharging debts while people of color are pushed into
“expensive and lengthy repayment plans”)
https://scholarship.law.vanderbilt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2376
Anything that can’t go on forever eventually stops. At a certain point,
it wasn’t possible for the Sacklers to maintain their cuddly billionaire
charade. It was time to shut down the Big Store con, cool the mark, and
blow town. For the Sacklers, that meant going to court. The Sacklers
were facing hundreds of billions of dollars in personal liability for
their individual and collective corrupt acts. They were being sued by
estates, by survivors, by cities, by states, and by the USA itself. If
even a fraction of these claims succeeded, the Sacklers would be wiped
out. To get away clean, the Sacklers needed a plan. Enter the
“Third-Party Nonconsensual Release,” a bizarre and wildly corrupt
feature of elite bankruptcy. The Sacklers offered the court a deal: they
would take the family business, Purdue Pharma, into bankruptcy, and kick
in a few billion out of their collective hoard. In return, the court
would settle all claims against both Purdue and the family. The family
would not have to go bankrupt. They could keep their billions. And no
one would be allowed to sue them for their opioid killing-spree, ever:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/18/lets-make-a-deal/#art-of-the-deal You
can’t make this argument in front of just any judge. It takes a Very
Special judge, with a Very Special brain, to grant a proposal like this.
There were just three courts in the USA where the Sacklers were likely
to find a willing accomplice: two in Texas, one in New York. They chose
the Empire State. To get their case in front of Judge Robert Drain, the
Sacklers opened a tiny, empty office in White Plains, New York. They
waited 190 days (satisfying the six-month residency requirement with a
few days to spare), and then filed in the Southern District of New York.
They hid invisible metadata in the PDF of their filing, which tricked
the Case Management/Electronic Case Files system into putting their case
in front of Drain. They even pre-captioned their brief with “RDD” for
Robert D Drain:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/23/a-bankrupt-process/#sacklers The
Sacklers’ plan worked. Judge Drain nonconsensually settled all the
third-party claims against the Sacklers, without requiring the Sacklers
to give up the majority of their fortunes. Then, Drain resigned from the
bench and took a cushy job with the BigLaw corporate crime enablers at
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom:
https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/judge-who-oversaw-purdue-sears-bankruptcies-join-law-firm-skadden-2023-04-13/
But the story doesn’t end here. While this kind of bankruptcy judge
shopping and third-party nonconsensual releases had been SOP for some of
the most vicious and unrepentant institutional criminals of the century,
the Sacklers’ impunity was so egregious, so revolting, that the Supreme
Court (yes, this Supreme Court!) agreed to hear a case challenging its
constitutionalilty:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/11/justice-delayed/#justice-redeemed As
the hearing looms, various “friends of the court” are filing amicus
briefs, trying to ensure that the Supremes understand what’s at stake
here. This is a normal part of any Supreme Court case, but what’s less
normal is who these amici are, and what they want the court to
understand. Writing for the New York Times, Abbie Van Sickle rounds up
an eye-popping summary of these amici and their concerns. Tldr? There
are a lot of pedophiles who are briefing for the Sacklers:
https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/03/us/politics/oxycontin-supreme-court-purdue-sacklers.html
First on deck is the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, who remind the
court that nonconsensual third-party releases were essential to the
Catholic Church’s ability to walk away from the untold number of
children abused by the clergy who were protected by the Church:
https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-124/288262/20231027145345921_23-124%20bsac%20USCCB%20Purdue%20Pharma.pdf
Next up are the Boy Scouts of America. Like the Bishops, the Scouts want
the Court to remember that the decades of sexual abuse committed by
scoutmasters who were protected by the BSA while their victims were
marginalized and silenced would have destroyed the Scouts if the victims
had been able to get justice. It was only through the magic of the
Third-Party Nonconsensual Release that the BSA was able to live on, even
after decades of unspeakable crimes. However the case pans out, there is
change in the air. Johnson &amp; Johnson’s bid to escape liability for
the years it spent knowingly telling women to dust their vulvas with
asbestos failed (thank goodness):
https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/01/j-and-j-jk/#risible-gambit Bankruptcy
scholars are taking aim at the obviously corrupt practice of bankruptcy
shopping: https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/07/hr-4193/#shoppers-choice
And the judges who specialize in these Third-Party Nonconsensual
Releases are dropping like flies. Not long after Judge Drain went
through the revolving door at a BigLaw firm, (ex-)Judge David Jones was
forced to resign when it emerged that he was romantically involved with
a lawyer who kept winning huge windfalls for her clients in his court:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/16/texas-two-step/#david-jones There’s
never just one ant. The kinds of judges, lawyers, law firms and
corporations who use the bankruptcy system this way are bound to be
corrupt in many, many other ways as well. Rooting out elite bankruptcy
fraud doesn’t have to stop in bankruptcy court. Anyone arrogant and
immoral enough to pull these scams will have plenty of other skeletons
in their closets. (Image: Jesse Collins, CC BY 3.0, modified) Hey look

<p>date: 2023-12-05, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I found this delicious and very easy way to steam fish. It&amp;#8217;s in the oven instead of over boiling liquid. It helps retain moisture and flavor. The combination of ginger, scallions and garlic form a flavorful sauce for steamed tilapia. It takes a few minutes to prepare ingredients, but then the oven does the rest of the work. Serving the fish over Chinese noodles makes a perfect pairing for the sauce. These are very thin noodles. There are several types. I use wheat-based noodles which take only 3 minutes to boil. You can also use angel hair pasta for this dinner..&lt;/p&gt;

id="more-than-950000-raised-for-palestinian-student-paralyzed-after-being-shot-in-vermont">More
Than $950,000 Raised for Palestinian Student Paralyzed After Being Shot
in Vermont</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>More than $950,000 has been raised for the recovery of one of the
three college students of Palestinian descent who was shot in Vermont
and is currently paralyzed from the chest down, according to a GoFundMe
page set up by his family.</p>
<p>One of the bullets that hit Hisham Awartani on Nov. 25 is lodged in
his spine, his family said.</p>
<p>“Hisham’s first thoughts were for his friends, then for his parents
who were thousands of miles away. He has demonstrated remarkable
courage, resilience and fortitude - even a sense of humor - even as the
reality of his paralysis sets in,” the fundraising page, which was set
up on Saturday, states.</p>
<p>Awartani, Kinnan Abdalhamid and Tahseen Ali Ahmad are childhood
friends who graduated from a private Quaker school in the West Bank and
now attend colleges in the eastern U.S. The 20-year-olds were visiting
Awartani’s relatives in Burlington for the Thanksgiving break. They were
walking to the house of Hisham’s grandmother for dinner when they were
shot in an unprovoked attack, the family said.</p>
<p>The young men were speaking in a mix of English and Arabic and two of
them were also wearing the black-and-white Palestinian keffiyeh scarves
when they were shot, Burlington Police Chief Jon Murad said. Authorities
are investigating the shooting as a possible hate crime.</p>
<p>“In a cruelly ironic twist, Hisham’s parents had recommended he not
return home over winter break, suggesting he would be safer in the US
with his grandmother,” the fundraising page states. “Burlington is a
second home to Hisham, who has spent summers and happy holidays with his
family there. It breaks our hearts that these young men did not find
safety in his home away from home.”</p>
<p>All three were seriously injured. Abdalhamid was released from the
hospital last week.</p>
<p>The suspected gunman, Jason J. Eaton, 48, was arrested the following
day at his Burlington apartment, where he answered the door with his
hands raised and told federal agents he had been waiting for them. Eaton
has pleaded not guilty to three counts of attempted murder and is
currently being held without bail.</p>
<p>The shooting came as threats against Jewish, Muslim and Arab
communities have increased across the U.S. in the weeks since the the
Israel-Hamas war erupted in early October.</p>
<p>Awartani, who speaks seven languages, is pursuing a dual degree in
math and archaeology at Brown University, where he is also a teaching
assistant, the fundraising page said. He told his college professors
that he is determined to start the next semester on time, according to
the fundraiser.</p>
<p>“We, his family, believe that Hisham will change the world,” the
fundraising page states. “He’ll change the world through his spirit, his
mind and his compassion for those much more vulnerable than himself,
especially the thousands of dead in Gaza and many more struggling to
survive the devastating humanitarian crisis unfolding there.”</p>

US Official Visits India, Discusses Alleged Plot to Kill Sikh
Separatist</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>White House deputy national security adviser Jon Finer led a U.S.
delegation to New Delhi on Monday where he noted the formation of an
investigative panel by India to probe an unsuccessful plot to
assassinate a Sikh separatist on U.S. soil.</p>
<p>“Mr. Finer acknowledged India’s establishment of a Committee of
Enquiry to investigate lethal plotting in the United States and the
importance of holding accountable anyone found responsible,” the White
House said in a statement Monday.</p>
<p>Last week, the U.S. Justice Department alleged that an Indian
government official directed an unsuccessful plot to assassinate a Sikh
separatist on U.S. soil, while it announced charges against a man
accused of orchestrating the attempted murder.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have named the target of the attempted murder as
Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh separatist and dual citizen of the
United States and Canada.</p>
<p>In response, India expressed concern about one of its government
officials being linked to the plot, from which it dissociated itself, as
being against government policy.</p>
<p>India said last week it would formally investigate the concerns aired
by the U.S. and take “necessary follow-up action” on the findings of a
panel set up on Nov. 18.</p>
<p>News of the incident came two months after Canada said there were
“credible” allegations linking Indian agents to the June murder of
another Sikh separatist leader, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, in a Vancouver
suburb, a contention India has rejected.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden, White House national security adviser Jake
Sullivan, CIA director Bill Burns and Secretary of State Antony Blinken
have discussed this issue with their Indian counterparts in recent
weeks.</p>
<p>The issue is highly delicate for both India and the Biden
administration as they try to build closer ties in the face of an
ascendant China perceived as a threat for both democracies.</p>
<p>The Indian government has long complained about the presence of Sikh
separatist groups outside India. New Delhi views them as security
threats. The groups have kept alive the movement for Khalistan, or the
demand for an independent Sikh state to be carved out of India.</p>
<p>Finer met Indian foreign minister S. Jaishankar and National Security
Adviser Ajit Doval. They also discussed developments in the Middle East,
including the Israel-Hamas war, plans for a post-war Gaza and recent
attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea, the White House said
Monday.</p>

<h2 id="the-hidden-secrets-of-the-fn-key-on-the-mac">The hidden secrets
of the Fn key on the Mac</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Even if you’ve used the Mac for decades, I suspect you have never
fully understood the Fn key. Not helping is the fact that Apple
sometimes calls it the Function key, but all Mac keyboards already have
12 or more numbered F-for-Function keys! The Fn key first appeared in
1998 in the PowerBook G3 Series (Wallstreet) and has become a fixture in
the lower-left corner of laptop keyboards ever since. The Fn key
migrated to standalone keyboards only in 2007 with the release of the
Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad, where it occupies a spot between the
Delete key and the Home key. On Apple’s compact desktop keyboards, it
reverts to the lower-left corner. ↫ Adam Engst at TibBITS This article
made me wonder when the Fn key first appeared, but searching for it
leads to a lot of SEO spam that is clearly all wrong. As the article
notes, Apple first introduced it in 1998, and IBM already it in on the
monochrome ThinkPad 300 in 1992. It’s much older than that, though; the
IBM PC Convertible from 1986 also had one, as did the IBM PCjr from
1984. At this point I’m starting to think it was actually a fairly
common key, but with the explosion of IBM compatibles in the early ’80s
it’s basically impossible to check them all, and, of course, there’s the
possibility it may have existed on earlier systems, or third-party
keyboards long lost to time. This would be an interesting mystery to
solve.</p>

Heads to Mexico to Boost Work on Fentanyl, Supply Chains</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will travel to Mexico City this
week to boost cooperation with Mexican counterparts on combating illicit
finance and the trafficking of fentanyl, and work to strengthen Mexico’s
role in U.S. supply chains, Treasury officials said Monday. </p>
<p>Yellen’s Tuesday-to-Thursday trip will include meetings with Mexican
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and the country’s central bank
governor and finance minister, among others, Treasury said in a
statement. </p>
<p>The trip follows Treasury’s announcement Monday of a counter-fentanyl
“strike force” that will bring together the department’s resources,
including the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence and the
Internal Revenue Service’s Criminal Investigation unit to disrupt
illicit drug trafficking. </p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping last month
agreed to deepen cooperation to stem the flow of fentanyl precursor
chemicals from China, which are often mixed by Mexican drug gangs before
distribution in the U.S. </p>
<p>Illicit fentanyl and other synthetic opioids cause tens of thousands
of overdose deaths every year. The formation of the task force comes as
the Treasury in recent months has intensified its sanctions efforts
targeting fentanyl logistics in Mexico. </p>
<p>“Treasury will use every tool at its disposal to disrupt the ability
of drug traffickers to peddle this poison in our country,” Yellen said
in a statement. </p>
<p>Disguised </p>
<p>The Treasury for years has imposed sanctions on Mexican cartels and
their money-laundering entities. While these have disrupted individual
cartels, the efforts have done little to stem the overall cross-border
drug trade, estimated at $20 billion to $30 billion a year, said Earl
Anthony Wayne, a former U.S. ambassador to Mexico from 2011 to
2015. </p>
<p>“Somehow that money gets back to cartels,” said Wayne, now a lecturer
at American University’s School of International Service. “Neither the
U.S. nor Mexico has been very good at finding that money.” </p>
<p>A senior U.S. Treasury official said Yellen will discuss with Mexican
counterparts and financial institution executives ways to step up
efforts to fight illicit drug finance, including better coordination of
investigations, as narcotics traffickers “continue to innovate.” </p>
<p>The goal is to be more effective at exposing drug supply chains that
are disguised as legitimate commercial trade and cut off their access to
financing, the Treasury official said. The department has imposed
sanctions on over 250 entities related to drug trafficking in the past
two years. </p>
<p>Friend-shoring, national security </p>
<p>During her trip, Yellen also will promote Mexico’s role as a premier
destination for the “friend-shoring” of U.S. supply chains to make them
more resilient and promote U.S. national security interests, Treasury
officials said. </p>
<p>Mexico this year has overtaken China as the largest U.S. trading
partner, and investment continues to grow. </p>
<p>Among issues she plans to discuss are U.S. tax credits for electric
vehicles produced in North America and new Treasury rules limiting the
amount of Chinese-controlled content that can be allowed, which could
impact Chinese investment in Mexico.</p>

id="governor-rebukes-philadelphia-protesters-for-chanting-outside-israeli-eatery">Governor
Rebukes Philadelphia Protesters for Chanting Outside Israeli Eatery</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Protesters marching in Philadelphia against the bombardment of Gaza
chanted about genocide Sunday outside an Israeli-style restaurant,
leading Governor Josh Shapiro to call the demonstration
“antisemitic.”</p>
<p>In Philadelphia’s Center City and University City neighborhoods,
hundreds of people marched to criticize Israel’s military actions in
Gaza, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported.</p>
<p>However, it was unclear why some specifically protested the
restaurant. A video of demonstrators outside Goldie Falafel depicted
people chanting, “Goldie, Goldie, you can’t hide, we charge you with
genocide,” which garnered backlash from the Democratic governor.</p>
<p>Shapiro first addressed the protest on X, formerly known as Twitter.
Later Monday, appearing at an unrelated event in suburban Philadelphia,
the governor said he was in touch with Michael Solomonov, one of the
restaurant’s owners, to make sure he and his staff knew that the
governor would support them.</p>
<p>Solomonov is a prominent Israeli chef who has co-authored three
cookbooks and received several James Beard awards. He and Steve Cook,
the co-owner, are both Jewish.</p>
<p>“The purposeful gathering of a mob outside of a restaurant simply
because it is owned by a Jewish person - well, that’s antisemitism,
plain and simple,” Shapiro said at a separate news conference Monday in
suburban Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The governor - who, while campaigning last year, talked about his
Jewish faith and how it inspires him toward public service - called for
“a spirited debate, dialogue, peacefully and respectfully, about what’s
happening in the Middle East.”</p>
<p>Representatives of the restaurant’s group, CookNSolo, declined to
comment on the protest. Requests for comment were left with the
Philadelphia Palestine Coalition. A message seeking information on any
possible arrests was left with the Philadelphia Police Department.</p>
<p>White House spokesperson Andrew Bates called it “completely
unjustifiable” to target restaurants that serve Israeli food “over
disagreements with Israeli policy.”</p>
<p>Goldie Falafel is a vegan kosher restaurant that has five locations
in Philadelphia. CookNSolo operates several well-known restaurants with
Israeli fare in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>A line of people stretched into the street outside Goldie on Monday
afternoon, with many coming out to get food and to show support.</p>
<p>Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel triggered the deadliest
Israeli-Palestinian violence in decades. The war has killed thousands
and displaced over three-fourths of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million
people, who are running out of safe places to go.</p>
<p>The war has sparked protests across the U.S. and abroad. Students
around the country have faced suspension for demonstrations on college
campuses, and there have been high school walkouts. Demonstrators who
targeted specific companies have largely protested media bias and
focused on media outlets, including The New York Times.</p>

<p>
The second half of 2023 brought with itself a couple of big life changes
for me: not only did I move to the Netherlands from India, I also
started a new and exciting job at Crossref as the newest Community
Engagement Manager. In this role, I am a part of the Community
Engagement and Communications team, and my key responsibility is to
engage with the global community of scholarly editors, publishers, and
editorial organisations to develop sustained programs that help editors
to leverage rich metadata.

This represents an exciting phase in my professional journey, as I now
have the chance to learn and develop new skills, broaden my

Science</a> (Bengaluru, India). Having immensely enjoyed the process of
writing manuscripts based on the data that resulted from my PhD thesis,
I was drawn to working in the scholarly publishing industry. I worked
for 3.5 years as a Senior Associate at Wiley, overseeing an editor
support service by devising strategic scale-up planning and process
improvement initiatives.
</p>
<p>
I then moved countries as well as jobs and joined Crossref. The world of
scholarly communications is a rapidly changing ecosystem, that is ably
supported by scholarly infrastructure - the sets of tools and services
that support this industry. Being a part of Crossref, a global
organisation that provides open scholarly infrastructure, allows me to
work with and make an impact on the broad scholarly community that
ranges from publishers of all shapes and sizes, funders, to academic
institutions, and researchers.
</p>
<p>
So far, the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/categories/research-integrity/">integrity
of the scholarly record (ISR)</a> has been the focus of my work. Now
more than ever, the community is cognizant of the need to uphold the
integrity of the scholarly output. Metadata and relationships between
research outputs can support this endeavour in a substantial manner
because information such as who contributed to a research output, who
funded it, who cites it, whether it was updated after publication, aids
provenance and provides signals about whether the output is trustworthy.
</p>
<p>
Most of Crossref’s tools and services play a key role here: be it
reference linking to allow researchers to increase discoverability of
their work, tracking post-publication updates to research outputs via
Crossmark, or detecting text plagiarism via Similarity Check. We noticed
that not all editors and editorial teams associate metadata as signals
of integrity, and might be unaware of the benefits of rich metadata.
Therefore, my priority is to utilise opportunities to engage with
editors about how metadata can provide trust indicators about a research
output. I aim to empower editors to collect and leverage rich metadata.
</p>
<p>
While I am no stranger to the world of scholarly communications,
engaging with the broader Crossref community has been a new experience
for me. In my day to day work, I employ a range of different skills such
as program design and management, content planning and outreach,
networking, and meeting facilitation. I have also been participating in
trainings to enhance my skill set – I recently completed a training
course on
<a href="https://www.cscce.org/trainings/cef/" target="_blank">Community
Engagement Fundamentals</a>, which has equipped me with a better
understanding of the concepts and strategies that I will need as a
community manager. Additionally, I also underwent the Group Facilitation
Methods training course led by the Institute of Cultural Affairs (ICA)
where I learnt a couple of effective methods for group facilitation and
leading workshops.
</p>
<p>
Equipped with these skills, I have moderated a few community events
already – most prominently
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5VBUWz8KZY" target="_blank">the
community call about Crossref and Retraction Watch</a> to discuss
Crossref’s acquisition and opening up of the Retraction Watch database.
It was a valuable experience to contribute to the planning of an online
event and host a panel of distinguished guests.
</p>
<p>
I was also fortunate to be able to meet our community members in-person:
I supported the organisation of the Frankfurt roundtable event that was
held as part of Crossref’s Integrity of the Scholarly Record (ISR)
program, where we engaged with community members to get their
perspectives on how to work together towards preserving the integrity of
the scholarly record (keep watching this space for a forthcoming blog
summarising the outcomes from this event!). Additionally, I attended the
Frankfurt Book Fair – the experience of getting to meet our members and
to hear from them first-hand about all things Crossref, was
unparalleled! I used this opportunity to meet several of our publisher
members and discuss their view points about engaging with editors on
ISR. The idea was received positively: we heard specific suggestions of
metadata that would be of interest to readers of scientific manuscripts,
and our members also expressed interest in finding out more about how
metadata can act as markers of trust for a research output. I plan to
use the insights from these meetings for the development of the ISR
editor engagement program.
</p>
<p>
As I reflect on the past three months, there are a few things that have
stood out to me. In terms of work, no two days are the same. My work
plan for the day can range from making presentations for outreach
activities, creating content such as this blogpost, working on an
engagement strategy, to planning events, attending online or offline
community meetings, facilitating or moderating some of those events, and
networking with community members. This variety in work keeps me
motivated to give my best each day. I am also grateful that I have the
ability to make an impact with my work in an area that I am passionate
about. In my previous job, I had developed a good understanding of
research integrity and publication ethics. As a community manager now,
I’m looking to work with editorial teams on the integrity of the
scholarly record. This role gives me an opportunity to further nurture
this interest of mine.
</p>
<p>
At times, working from home remotely has been a challenge. However, I
have enjoyed attending in-person events as they are not just a chance to
meet our community members, but also a chance to meet my colleagues and
connect with them.
</p>
<p>
I feel privileged to be able to connect with research communities all
over the world and make a meaningful contribution towards supporting the
discoverability and impact of their work. I am particularly excited to
work at the forefront of shaping the future of preserving the integrity
of the scholarly record, in tandem with our community. If this is a
topic that excites you as well, I am keen to hear from you. It has been
a wonderful three months at Crossref so far and I look forward to future
collaborations with our community to develop effective ways of
supporting and empowering editors to make the most of metadata for their
publications.

<h2 id="pg_dbms_lock-v1.0-released">pg_dbms_lock v1.0 released</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-05, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
Toronto, Canada - December 03, 2023
</p>
<h2>
PostgreSQL pg_dbms_lock extension
</h2>
<p>
This PostgreSQL extension provided compatibility with the DBMS_LOCK
Oracle package except the <code>DBMS_LOCK.CONVERT()</code> function and
some unsupported lock modes who anyway are rarely found in the Oracle
PL/SQL stored procedures.
</p>
<p>
The following stored procedures are implemented:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>ALLOCATE_UNIQUE()</code>: Allocates a unique lock ID to a named
lock.
</li>
<li>
<code>REQUEST()</code>: Requests a lock of a specific mode.
</li>
<li>
<code>RELEASE()</code>: Releases a lock.
</li>
<li>
<code>SLEEP()</code>: Puts a procedure to sleep for a specific time.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For instance, user locks can be used to do the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Provide exclusive access to an external device or service (like a
printer).
</li>
<li>
Coordinate or synchronize parallelized applications.
</li>
<li>
Disable or enable execution of programs at specific times.
</li>
<li>
Detect whether a session has ended a transaction using COMMIT or
ROLLBACK.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is the initial release of this exention.

<h2 id="stateless-postgres-query-router-1.0.0-released">Stateless
Postgres Query Router 1.0.0 released</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-05, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
The SPQR team is proud to release the first production-ready version of
the SPQR (Stateless Postgres Query Router).
</p>
<p>
SPQR is a query router for horizontal scaling of PostgreSQL via
sharding. SPQR is designed to be as lightweight as a connection pooler,
reducing knowledge of the data schema to the necessary minimum.
</p>
<h2>
Main features
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Sharding</strong>. If possible, the router determines a shard
from the first statement of a transaction and keeps client bound to that
shard until transaction ends. But you can explicitly specify a shard or
a
<a href="https://github.com/pg-sharding/spqr/blob/master/test/regress/tests/router/expected/routing_hint.out#L30">sharding
key</a> in a comment request.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Transaction and session pooling</strong>. Just as in your
favorite connection pooler (Odyssey or PgBouncer).
</li>
<li>
<strong>Multiple routers for fault tolerance</strong>. The router stores
the sharding rules only for cache purposes. Information about the entire
installation is stored inside the QDB service, so the number of routers
running simultaneously is unlimited.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Shard rebalancing</strong>. Data migration between shards aims
to balance the workload across shards proportionally. The main idea is
to minimize any locking impact during these migrations, which is
accomplished by reducing the size of the data ranges being transferred.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Multiple servers and failover</strong>. In the router
configuration, it is possible to specify multiple servers for one shard.
Then the router will distribute read-only queries among the replicas.
However, in addition to the automatic routing, you also have the option
to explicitly define the destination for a specific query by using the
target-session-attr parameter within the query.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Minor overhead for query execution</strong>. See benchmarks
<a href="https://github.com/pg-sharding/spqr/blob/master/docs/Benchmarks.md">here</a>
and
<a href="https://gitlab.com/postgres-ai/postgresql-consulting/tests-and-benchmarks/-/issues/30">here</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Status of the project
</h2>
<p>
Essential set of features of the SPQR is used in production. But
automatic shard rebalancing is not production ready yet. Also, SPQR
supports some cross-shard queries, but they have inconsistent snapshot
and are not 2PC-locked to provide true cross-shard atomicity.
</p>
<p>
Currently, the project is being maintained by Yandex Cloud. However, we
are looking for new architects and contributors to broaden our technical
views. As always, any feedback is welcome.

<h2 id="red-sea-attacks-raise-tensions-as-us-kills-5-in-iraq">Red Sea
Attacks Raise Tensions as US Kills 5 in Iraq</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. forces killed five Iran-backed militants as they prepared to
launch a drone attack in Iraq, as the number of attacks on U.S. forces
in Iraq and Syria rose to 76 since mid-October.</p>
<p>Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters Monday
that U.S. forces saw the militants Sunday as they were beginning to
launch an attack drone and fired a precision munition from a U.S. drone
to take them out.</p>
<p>“We felt that … it was going to be a threat to U.S. forces, and
because we have the inherent right to self-defense we took action,” she
said.</p>
<p>Iranian-backed proxies launched two multi-rocket attacks against U.S.
forces in eastern Syria over the weekend; one targeting Rumalyn Landing
Zone and another targeting forces in Shadaddi. The attacks resulted in
no casualties or damage to infrastructure.</p>
<p>“Iran, we believe, is the ultimate party responsible” for attacks on
ships transiting near Red Sea, national security adviser Jake Sullivan
said Monday.</p>
<p>“This is an issue for the entire world,” he added.</p>
<p>The latest violence in Iraq and Syria comes as Iranian-backed Houthi
insurgents in Yemen hit three commercial ships in the Red Sea with
missiles Sunday, in what could be a further escalation in a string of
maritime attacks in the Middle East linked to the nearly
two-month-old Israel-Hamas war.</p>
<p>“Houthi forces attacked multiple commercial vessels in the Red Sea,”
the Defense Department told VOA. “The USS Carney lended aid in some
circumstances and shot down Houthi drones that were headed in its
general direction.”</p>
<p>According to U.S. Central Command, after the first ballistic missile
hit the waters near M/V Unity Explorer, the USS Carney, a guided missile
destroyer, responded and took out a drone heading in the direction of
the two ships.</p>
<p>Less than an hour later, M/V Unity Explorer was hit by a Houthi
missile, causing minor damage. While the USS Carney was responding to
the ship’s distress call, Houthis fired another drone at the ships that
was shot down by the Carney crew.</p>
<p>A few hours later, missiles launched from Yemen hit two more
commercial ships, the M/V Number 9 and the M/V Sophie II, damaging both
vessels. While responding to the Sophie II’s distress call, USS Carney
shot down another drone heading in its direction.</p>
<p>Singh said the Pentagon assessed the Carney was not the target of any
of the attacks, but when pressed by VOA, she acknowledged that this was
an initial assessment and the Pentagon had not ruled out the possibility
that the Carney might have been a drone target.</p>
<p>“It came close enough that the commander of the ship felt that it was
a threat and needed to engage and shoot down that drone,” she said.</p>
<p>Singh added that the attacks were “very concerning” but would not say
how or whether the U.S. would respond. In 2016, the U.S. launched
Tomahawk cruise missiles that destroyed three coastal radar sites in
Houthi-controlled territory to retaliate for missiles being fired at
U.S. Navy ships.</p>
<p>A Houthi military spokesperson, Brigadier General Yahya
Saree, claimed responsibility for the attacks, saying the rebels hit one
vessel with a missile and another with a drone while in the Bab
el-Mandeb Strait that links the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden.</p>
<p>“The Yemeni armed forces continue to prevent Israeli ships from
navigating the Red Sea [and Gulf of Aden] until the Israeli aggression
against our steadfast brothers in the Gaza Strip stops,” Saree said.
“The Yemeni armed forces renew their warning to all Israeli ships or
those associated with Israelis that they will become a legitimate target
if they violate what is stated in this statement.”</p>
<p>Saree also identified the first vessel hit as the Unity Explorer,
which is owned by a British firm that includes Dan David Ungar, who
lives in Israel, as one of its officers. The Houthi spokesperson said
the second hit was a Panamanian-flagged container ship called Number 9,
which is linked to Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement.</p>
<p>Israeli media have identified Ungar as being the son of Israeli
shipping billionaire Abraham “Rami” Ungar.</p>
<p>For more than a month, Iranian-backed militias have conducted drone
and rocket attacks against the 2,500 American troops based in Iraq and
the 900 troops in Syria.</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>It was Big Sur that focussed attention on the size of macOS updates.
In Mojave and earlier, updates had essentially been Installer packages
that brought a minimum of overhead. By the time that many had installed
Big Sur’s new Signed System Volume (SSV), we were starting to discover
just how large its updates were. Those were early days with its
completely new updating process that builds a new System volume, takes a
snapshot of it, and constructs a tree of hashes that verify the
integrity of every last bit within it. ↫ Howard Oakley I had no idea
macOS updates had become as big as they had, and good on Apple for
trying to bring this back down again, and speed up installation of
updates, too.</p>

<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDYzNDg1Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MzkxNzM5MX0.oeBMy6dLjonQrM9-BN3W6f-bDDIgOWGmRCadzaiFVWQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
COP is always awash in new policy reports and scientific studies. It can
be hard to figure out which are the most important. So I want to draw
your attention to a particularly interesting report that came out in
Dubai over the weekend. On Sunday, a consortium of climate science
groups released this year’s
“<a href="https://10insightsclimate.science/" target="_blank">10 New
Insights in Climate Science</a>,” a synopsis of the most recent climate
research.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The report was written at the invitation of the UN Framework Convention
on Climate Change, and it’s meant to keep negotiators up to date on
climate science in between major reports from the larger
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. (Some IPCC authors also work
on the “10 New Insights” report.) But it does something interesting that
I want to highlight. Here were
<a href="https://10insightsclimate.science/" target="_blank">its top
three insights</a>:
</p>
<p>
A. Overshooting 1.5 degrees Celsius [of global temperature rise] is fast
becoming inevitable. Minimizing the magnitude and duration of overshoot
is essential.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>B. A rapid and managed fossil fuel phase-out is required to
stay within the Paris Agreement target range.
</p>
<p>
C. Robust policies are critical to attain the scale needed for effective
carbon dioxide removal (CDR).
</p>
<p>
The big news here, of course, is the continued message that we are on
track to rapidly exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius of temperature rise, the
level at which climate change will become especially disastrous. And
probably the second biggest news is how the report — which was written
before this week — appears to directly contradict
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/04/climate/cop28-aljaber-fossil-fuels.html" target="_blank">recently
surfaced remarks</a> from Sultan Al-Jaber, the president of this COP and
the head of the U.A.E.’s national oil company. In a video from November
21 first reported by <em>The</em> <em>Guardian</em>, Al-Jaber
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/04/climate/cop28-aljaber-fossil-fuels.html" target="_blank">said</a>
that there was “no science out there, or no scenario out there” to
support the idea that fossil fuels must be phased out to stay within the
1.5 degree Celsius limit.
</p>
<p>
While Al-Jaber denied saying those remarks this morning, the remarks
have been a huge deal at COP for the past few days, as they drive at the
tension of an oil executive leading an international climate conference.
</p>
<p>
But I wanted to focus on one more aspect of the report: its endorsement
of carbon dioxide removal. The report says steadfastly that carbon
dioxide removal is essential to meeting our climate goals, and that we
need to invest more in CDR technologies to scale them up fast enough.
But it pairs that insight with the idea that we also need to phase out
fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
Instead of treating carbon dioxide removal as a tissue to cover up
emissions — which is the role it can sometimes play in public
discussions — it pairs it with the need to phase out fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
I asked Oliver Geden, an author of the new report and the head of
climate research at the German Institute for International and Security
Affairs, about that pairing — and about whether mentioning CDR at all
would seem to apologize for future fossil-fuel emissions. Here’s what he
told me:
</p>
<p>
“The report directly says that CDR can only be seen as a complement to
emissions reductions, not as a substitute to emissions reductions. Of
course in the general climate debate, it often appears that proponents
of some continued fossil fuel use then evoke CDR. But if you look at the
IPCC scenarios, and then you look at national net-zero emissions
scenarios, it usually comes only on top — counterbalancing a net-zero
pathway, often on hard-to-abate residual emissions from industrialized
sectors.”
</p>
<p>
I think this pairing — a phaseout of fossil fuels and a get-serious
moment about CDR — is promising.
</p>
<p>
In non-COP news, it’s now official: More than 1 million electric cars
and light-duty trucks
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@corey_cantor/post/C0cdaKgRHVn/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank">were
sold this year in the United States</a>, the largest number ever.

id="former-us-diplomat-charged-with-spying-for-cuba-for-decades">Former
US Diplomat Charged With Spying for Cuba for Decades</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A former U.S. ambassador to Bolivia, Manuel Rocha, has been charged
with spying for Cuba since at least 1981.</p>
<p>Rocha, 73, was arrested in Miami on Friday and charged with multiple
federal crimes, including acting as an illegal foreign agent and using a
fraudulently obtained passport.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, Rocha met with Cuban intelligence
operatives and gave false information to U.S. government officials about
his travels. Prosecutors said Rocha concealed his identity as a foreign
agent in efforts to protect himself, so he could continue engaging in
“clandestine activity” for the Cuban government. </p>
<p>The United States requires individuals acting for the benefit of
foreign agencies to register with the U.S. Justice Department.</p>
<p>Rocha, a Colombian born, naturalized U.S. citizen, held several
positions within the U.S. State Department, giving him “unique access,”
to non-public government information, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Rocha joined the department in 1981 and worked his way up to becoming
the top U.S. diplomat in Argentina between 1997 and 2000, and later the
ambassador to Bolivia from 2000 to 2002. </p>
<p>Rocha’s arrest comes as the Justice Department ramps up criminal
enforcement of illicit foreign affairs.</p>
<p>Since last year, the FBI has been running a series of undercover
operations that include an FBI agent pretending to be a Cuban contact.
In an undercover meeting in Miami last year, Rocha exposed that he had
been instructed by the Cuban government’s intelligence services to “lead
a normal life” and that he had created the “legend,” or artificial
persona, “of a right-wing person,” according to a recording of the
meeting cited in court documents.</p>
<p>In the meetings with the undercover FBI agent, Rocha repeatedly
referred to the United States as the enemy and used the term “we” to
describe himself and Cuba.</p>
<p>Rocha was expected to make his initial appearance in court on Monday.
It was not clear whether he had a lawyer.</p>
<p>Some information in this report came from The Associated Press and
Reuters.</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-04, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p>
Under pressure from the U.S. to hold a free and fair election,
Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro upped the ante.<strong> </strong>On
Sunday, the nation went to the polls — to vote to invade its neighbor
and
<a href="https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2023/10/10/guyanas-oil-boom-the-worlds-newest-petrostate-plans-to-combat-climate-change-with-oil-revenues" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
world’s newest petrostate</a>, Guyana.
</p>
<p>
Approval was seemingly
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/04/venezuela-referendum-2023-results-guyana-region-claim-succeeds-sovereignty-essequibo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">swift
and suspiciously overwhelming</a>. According to the Venezuelan National
Electoral Council, the ballot’s five-question referendum — which
culminated in asking if Caracas should incorporate Guyana’s Essequibo
region “into the map of Venezuelan territory” — passed by a margin of
95%.
</p>
<p>
Calling the vote a free or fair election might be a bit of a stretch;
local opponents
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-67610200" target="_blank">seized
on the fact</a> that the National Electoral Council touted “10.5 million
votes cast,” rather than the overall number of voters, meaning that —
given the five ballot questions — potentially as few as 2 million people
actually turned out to vote in the nation of 28.2 million.
<em style="">Reuters</em> also reported that
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/04/venezuela-referendum-2023-results-guyana-region-claim-succeeds-sovereignty-essequibo" style="" target="_blank">lines</a>
were scarce at voting centers.
</p>
<p>
Still, snatching the Essequibo region,
<a href="https://x.com/vtchakarova/status/1731592949325050024?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">which
makes up about two-thirds of Guyana</a> and is roughly the size of
Florida, is popular among Venezuelans due to a controversial 1899
decision by an international tribunal that gave the territory to what
was then the British colony of Guiana. Venezuelans have long considered
themselves to have been
<a href="https://theglobalamericans.org/2023/12/the-essequibo-dispute-colonial-roots-and-modern-implications/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">swindled</a>
by Western powers in the deal, with decades of
<a href="https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/12/04/venezuelas-autocrat-nicolas-maduro-threatens-to-annex-guyana" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">revanchist
schooling and local propaganda</a> making the Essequibo issue an easy
and appealing way for Maduro to shore up domestic support.
</p>
<p>
It remains unclear, though, how far Venezuela might go in the
enforcement of its claim on the land,
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/americas/venezuelans-approve-takeover-of-oil-rich-region-of-guyana-in-referendum/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CNN
notes</a>. International Court of Justice President Joan E. Donoghue
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/04/venezuela-referendum-2023-results-guyana-region-claim-succeeds-sovereignty-essequibo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has
nevertheless warned</a> that Caracas appears to be “taking steps with a
view toward acquiring control over and administering the territory in
dispute.” Comparisons to
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/04/venezuelans-vote-to-claim-sovereignty-over-part-of-oil-rich-guyana.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine</a> and Argentina’s 1982 invasion of the Falkland
Islands are already popping up, with commentators wondering
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuela-covets-guyanas-oil-fields-land-dispute-referendum-827462e1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">what
President Biden will do</a> if the crisis escalates to actual fighting —
and on America’s hemispheric doorstep, no less.
</p>
<p>
Many experts on the region also say the referendum, and any ensuing land
grab, are
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/03/world/americas/maduro-vote-essequibo-guyana.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">distractions</a>
meant to bolster nationalist sentiment and Maduro’s popularity during a
time of domestic turmoil and
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/03/world/americas/maduro-vote-essequibo-guyana.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">outside
pressure for a leadership change</a>. But it’s hardly a coincidence that
the land in dispute is oil-rich — and newly considered to be so. Guyana
was a poor, remote, and tiny neighbor to Venezuela before the discovery
of oil offshore (and in Essequibo) in 2015. Now the country is thought
to be sitting on 11 billion recoverable barrels and international oil
companies are
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/chevron-hess-exxonmobil-guyana" target="_self">jostling
for a go at the reserves</a>, even as Guyana faces the irony of
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-11-18/exxon-oil-drilling-is-guyana-s-climate-change-solution" target="_blank">being
especially susceptible to climate change</a>.
</p>
<p>
The easy comparison between the two oil states makes the situation even
more bruising for Caracas: Guyana is now “set to surpass the oil
production of Venezuela,”
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/01/americas/venezuela-essequibo-referendum-guyana-intl/index.html" target="_blank">CNN
writes</a>, while the latter country’s production has dropped from a
height of 3 million barrels per day in 1999
<a href="https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/venezuela-oil-guyana-essequibo/" target="_blank">to
a mere 700,000 barrels per day this year</a>, due to ongoing
mismanagement and U.S. sanctions. No wonder the oil reserves just across
the border look so tempting.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps, then, this will be the way the world’s next oil war starts: Not
with a bang but with a vote.

<h2 id="spotify-to-lay-off-1500-employees">Spotify to Lay Off 1,500
Employees</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Spotify says it is planning to lay off 17% of its global workforce,
amounting to around 1,500 employees, following layoffs earlier this year
of 600 people in January and an additional 200 in June.</p>
<p>The music streaming giant is continuing its effort to cut costs and
work toward becoming profitable, said Spotify CEO Daniel Ek in a
prepared statement.</p>
<p>“By most metrics, we were more productive but less efficient,” he
said. “We need to be both.”</p>
<p>The layoffs come following a rare quarterly net profit of about $70.3
million in October. The company has never seen a full year net
profit.</p>
<p>“I realize that for many, a reduction of this size will feel
surprisingly large given the recent positive earnings report and our
performance,” Ek said. “We debated making smaller reductions throughout
2024 and 2025. Yet, considering the gap between our financial goal … and
our current operational costs, I decided that a substantial action to
right size our costs was the best option to accomplish our
objectives.”</p>
<p>With the new layoffs, the company now expects to see a fourth quarter
loss between $100 million to $117 million after previously anticipating
a $40 million profit.</p>
<p>A majority of the charges will go toward severance for laid off
employees, who will get about five months’ pay, vacation pay and health
care coverage for the severance period.</p>
<p>Spotify did not clearly state when the layoffs would become
financially beneficial but said that they would “generate meaningful
operating efficiencies going forward.”</p>
<p>Spotify is following many companies in the tech industry trying to
cut costs after growth in the industry slowed following a surge during
the COVID pandemic.</p>
<p>Tech giants including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google parent
company, Alphabet, all have plans to cut 10,000 or more people this
year.</p>
<p>Spotify began informing affected employees on Monday.</p>
<p>Some information in this report came from Reuters, The Associated
Press and Agence France-Presse.</p>

a record $500 million pledge from Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg’s
charitable arm. ↫Joseph Menn for The Washington Post This is why “voting

corporatists trying to absolve corporations from misdeeds and shifting

Supreme Court Wrestles With OxyContin Maker’s Bankruptcy Deal</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Supreme Court on Monday wrestled with a nationwide settlement
with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma that would shield members of the
Sackler family who own the company from civil lawsuits over the toll of
opioids. </p>
<p>The justices seemed by turns relucant to break up an exhaustively
negotiated agreement, but also leery of somehow rewarding the
Sacklers. </p>
<p>The agreement hammered out with state and local governments and
victims would provide billions of dollars to combat the opioid epidemic.
The Sacklers would contribute up to $6 billion and give up ownership of
the company, but retain billions more. The company would emerge from
bankruptcy as a different entity, with its profits used for treatment
and prevention. </p>
<p>The high court put the settlement on hold during the summer, in
response to objections from the Biden administration. </p>
<p>“It seems as though the federal government is standing in the way of
that as against the huge, huge, huge majority of claimants,” Justice
Elena Kagan said. </p>
<p>But later, Kagan also said that in bankruptcies, protection against
lawsuits has a price. </p>
<p>“You get a discharge when you put all your assets on the table,” she
said. “The Sacklers didn’t come anywhere close to doing that.” </p>
<p>The issue for the justices is whether the legal shield that
bankruptcy provides can be extended to people such as the Sacklers, who
have not declared bankruptcy themselves. Lower courts have issued
conflicting decisions over that issue, which also has implications for
other major product liability lawsuits settled through the bankruptcy
system. </p>
<p>The U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee, an arm of the Justice Department,
contends that the bankruptcy law does not permit protecting the Sackler
family from being sued. During the Trump administration, the government
supported the settlement. </p>
<p>Justice Department lawyer Curtis Gannon told the court Monday that
negotiations could resume, and perhaps lead to a better deal, if the
court were to stop the current agreement. </p>
<p>Proponents of the plan said third-party releases are sometimes
necessary to forge an agreement, and federal law imposes no prohibition
against them. </p>
<p>“Forget a better deal,” lawyer Pratik Shah, representing victims and
other creditors in the bankruptcy, told the justices. “There is no other
deal.” </p>
<p>Lawyers for more than 60,000 victims who support the settlement
called it “a watershed moment in the opioid crisis,” while recognizing
that “no amount of money could fully compensate” victims for the damage
caused by the misleading marketing of OxyContin, a powerful prescription
painkiller. </p>
<p>A lawyer for a victim who opposes the settlement calls the provision
dealing with the Sacklers “special protection for billionaires.” </p>
<p>OxyContin first hit the market in 1996, and Purdue Pharma’s
aggressive marketing of it is often cited as a catalyst of the
nationwide opioid epidemic, persuading doctors to prescribe painkillers
with less regard for addiction dangers. </p>
<p>The drug and the Stamford, Connecticut-based company became
synonymous with the crisis, even though the majority of pills being
prescribed and used were generic drugs. Opioid-related overdose deaths
have continued to climb, hitting 80,000 in recent years. Most of those
are from fentanyl and other synthetic drugs. </p>
<p>The Purdue Pharma settlement would be among the largest reached by
drug companies, wholesalers and pharmacies to resolve epidemic-related
lawsuits filed by state, local and Native American tribal governments
and others. Those settlements have totaled more than $50 billion. </p>
<p>But the Purdue Pharma settlement would be one of only two so far that
include direct payments to victims from a $750 million pool. Payouts are
expected to range from about $3,500 to $48,000. </p>
<p>Sackler family members no longer are on the company’s board, and they
have not received payouts from it since before Purdue Pharma entered
bankruptcy. In the decade before that, though, they were paid more than
$10 billion, about half of which family members said went to pay
taxes. </p>
<p>A decision in Harrington v. Purdue Pharma, 22-859, is expected by
early summer.</p>

Lawmakers Urge State Dept. to Designate Journalist ‘Wrongfully
Detained’</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Eight U.S. lawmakers have called on the State Department to designate
American Russian journalist Alsu Kurmasheva as “wrongfully
detained.”</p>
<p>In a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the lawmakers, led
by Democrats Eleanor Holmes Norton and Adam Schiff, requested updates on
Kurmasheva, who has been detained in Russia since October 18.</p>
<p>The Prague-based editor for the Tatar-Bashkir service of Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty, or RFE/RL, was detained while in Russia handling a
family emergency.</p>
<p>Russian authorities accuse Kurmasheva of failing to register as a
foreign agent, which she rejects. A court Friday ordered her held until
February. If convicted, Kurmasheva could be jailed for up to five
years.</p>
<p>The U.S. lawmakers requested information on the State Department’s
efforts to secure consular access. Russia has so far denied such
requests.</p>
<p>They urged the State Department to designate the Russian journalist
as “wrongfully detained.”</p>
<p>“Based on the facts that are known, we believe a formal designation
is warranted and remains important to ensure the full engagement of the
U.S. government and the provision of all relevant resources to support
Ms. Kurmasheva and her family as efforts continue to return her to her
loved ones as soon as possible,” the letter said.</p>
<p>The State Department designated jailed Wall Street Journal reporter
Evan Gershkovich as wrongfully detained within two weeks of the
American’s arrest in Russia.</p>
<p>Russian authorities accuse Gershkovich of espionage, which he and his
media outlet deny.</p>
<p>State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Monday that calls
for the United States to designate someone as wrongfully detained is “a
matter we take very seriously here,” adding that the government has to
look at statutory requirements and other available information. </p>
<p>“No one should read anything into the lack of other wrongful
detention determinations,” Miller said, adding that it is an “ongoing,
active process inside the United States government.” </p>
<p>On Monday, Gershkovich marked 250 days in a Russian prison. A court
last week extended his detention to January 30.</p>
<p>Wall Street Journal journalist Paul Beckett sees similarities in the
case of his colleagues Gershkovich and Kurmasheva.</p>
<p>“To me, they’re both journalists who have been grabbed by the
Russians for leverage over the United States,” said Beckett, who is
leading the newspaper’s campaign to secure Gershkovich’s release.</p>
<p>Kurmasheva’s husband, Pavel Butorin, has said the wrongfully detained
designation could give the family access to greater resources to help
free his wife.</p>
<p>“I’m convinced that Alsu’s being targeted because she’s an American
citizen and because she is a journalist for Radio Free Europe/Radio
Liberty,” Butorin told VOA last week.</p>
<p>Butorin is the director of Current Time TV, a Russian-language TV and
digital network led by RFE/RL in partnership with VOA.</p>
<p>Kurmasheva’s family and colleagues have pressed the U.S. for help to
secure her release.</p>
<p>“We would like to see more involvement from the United States
government and from other parties, as well from the European Union and
from human rights organizations,” Butorin said.</p>
<p>U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) chief executive Amanda Bennett
on Friday said it was “crucial” for Kurmasheva’ to be officially
designated wrongfully detained “so that her case can receive the time
and attention it deserves.”</p>
<p>USAGM is an independent global media agency that oversees Voice of
America and five other broadcasting entities.</p>
<p>“Every day that Alsu Kurmasheva remains behind bars is a tragedy for
her husband and two young children, her community, and journalists
everywhere,” said Bennett in a prepared statement.</p>
<p>VOA State Department bureau chief Nike Ching contributed to this
report.</p>

The use of buy now, pay later services hit an all-time high this past
Cyber Monday. Consumers spent $940 million online using BNPL, which
they’ve continued coming back to as high inflation and credit card

carry. Plus, we hear about the latest rounds of layoffs at Spotify and

<p>Early language acquisition students, at the elementary and middle

us who are old, incurious, and set in our ways: The language contains
synonyms. These excess words which ancestors have failed to prune
represent the lack of insight and care that characterizes the older

understand the game much better now. I do sometimes make mistakes, and
always pay for them. The thing that keeps me coming back is the feeling
when you press Return to see the result of your first guess. It’s like
opening a present, only better. If you get two green tiles, you can bask
in the glow of being extremely lucky. If you guess well you usually can
solve the puzzle in three or at most four moves. I’ve never gotten it in
two, and I don’t usually try, and when I do it’s usually a mistake, I
would have done better to stick with the plan of eliminating a bunch of
letters and confirming others, and then go for solution in the third
round. But the thing that keeps me coming back is the feeling of getting
a really good present, and that feeling of fortune and a bit of love,
self-love, when you see the answer, decide to go for it, and see five
green tiles open up

<h2 id="running-a-macbook-pro-with-debian">Running a MacBook Pro with
Debian</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-04, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Running a MacBook Pro with Debian
</h1>
<p>
Two days ago my
<a href="2018-06-08_Librem_13_by_Purism_Mini_Review">Purism laptop</a>
stopped working: As soon as the boot process tried to access the SDD, it
would shut down.
</p>
<p>
I started wondering about bringing the old MacBook Pro back to life. We
had stopped using it after my wife bought a new Mac. This seemed like
the best solution at the time. She only wanted a system where there was
at least a chance of getting decent support from friends or shops,
i.e. Windows or macOS. And we didn’t want to continue using the MacBook
Pro because Apple had decided to no longer support those machines with
macOS updates.
</p>
<p>
I always felt bad about having a perfectly usable laptop sitting around
that I had used myself for so long before buying the Purism laptop. But
now that the Purism laptop was out of order and my wife had moved to a
new laptop, I started wondering about installing Debian on the MacBook
Pro.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://weirder.earth/@j12i" title="@j12i@weirder.earth"><span
class="citation" data-cites="j12i">@j12i</span></a> suggested that I
might just try to plug the USB stick with the Debian installer into the
Mac since the chip architecture was compatible. I tried that, and it
worked!
</p>
<p>
Then
<a class="account" href="https://weirder.earth/@j12i" title="@j12i@weirder.earth"><span
class="citation" data-cites="j12i">@j12i</span></a> had an even strange
idea:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If it physically fits, you could even try the drive from the librem in
the macbook. Should only need fixing up the bootloader, if at all.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And so it was!
</p>
<p>
The SDD plugged into the MacBook Pro was mounted correctly by the rescue
system on the stick. I reinstalled GRUB on /dev/sda and after a reboot I
was running Debian on the MacBook Pro!
</p>
<p>
Everything seems a bit slow, but this is definitely workable. What a
great idea!
</p>
<p>
I installed <code>firmware-b43-installer</code> in order to get the
wireless card to run. The wireless card is a BCM4322 802.11a/b/g/n
Wireless LAN Controller (rev 01). Broadcom is such a sadface.
</p>
<p>
I decided that perhaps Gnome was slow and I should go and try sway
again. I installed <code>gpomme</code> for the Apple hotkeys (change
display brightness, change volume) but then I couldn’t get the trackpad
to invert the y-axis and I’m back to Gnome…
</p>
<p>
A bit later, I figured that perhaps the input source detection wasn’t
working so I mashed it all together, and now it works!
</p>
<pre><code>input * {
    dwt enabled
    tap enabled
    natural_scroll enabled
    middle_emulation disabled
    xkb_layout us
    xkb_variant altgr-intl
    xkb_options compose:caps
}
</code></pre>
<p>
It’s still looking good. The camera seems to be working, too.

<strong>2023-12-03</strong> Fixed the Purism laptop issue, switched the
drives back, and things still work. So for the moment the MacBook Pro is
back on the shelf. It’s just nice to know that I have a working backup
laptop should the need arise.
</p>
<p>
And I noticed a few things, too:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I like how the keyboard just works
</li>
<li>
I have a problem with the bottom left corner arrangement of fn ctrl alt
gui aka. Function Control Option and Command
</li>
<li>
I like that the laptop has an ethernet plug
</li>
<li>
I like that the laptop has a CD/DVD reader
</li>

Francis Spufford’s “Cahokia Jazz” (04 Dec 2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-04, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Francis Spufford’s “Cahokia Jazz”: A stunning alternate
history that fires on every cylinder. Hey look at this: Delights to
delectate. This day in history: 2003, 2008, 2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon:
Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing
projects, current reading Francis Spufford’s “Cahokia Jazz” (permalink)
Francis Spufford’s Cahokia Jazz is a fucking banger: it’s a taut,
unguessable whuddunit, painted in ultrablack noir, set in an alternate
Jazz Age in a world where indigenous people never ceded most the west to
the USA. It’s got gorgeously described jazz music, a richly realized
modern indigenous society, and a spectacular romance. It’s amazing:
https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Cahokia-Jazz/Francis-Spufford/9781668025451
Cahokia is the capital city of Deseret, a majority Catholic, majority
indigenous state at the western frontier of the USA. It swirls with
industry, wealth, and racial politics, serving as both a refuge from Jim
Crow and a hive of Klan activity. Joe Barrow is new in town, a veteran
who survived the trenches of WWI and moved to Cahokia with his army
buddy, Phineas Drummond, where they both quickly rose through the police
ranks to become detectives. We meet Joe and Phin on a frigid government
building rooftop in the predawn night, attending a grisly murder.
Someone has laid out a man across a skylight, cut his throat, split his
chest open, and excised his heart. This Aztec-inspired killing points at
Cahokian indigenous independence gangs, some of whom embrace an
apocryphal tale of being descended from Mesoamerican conquerors in the
distant past. That makes this more than a mere ugly killing – it’s a
political flashpoint. The Klan insists that Cahokia’s system of communal
land ownership is a form of communism (Russia never ceded Alaska in this
world, so the USSR is now extending tendrils across the Bering Strait).
They also insist that Cahokians’ reverence for the Sun and the Moon –
indigenous royals who have formally ceded power to elected leaders –
makes them a threat to democracy. Finally, the Cahokians’ fusion of
Catholocism with traditional faith makes the spritually suspect. A
rooftop blood-sacrifice could cause simmering political tension to boil
over, and for ever white oligarch drooling at the thought of enclosing
the shared land of Deseret, there are a thousand useful idiots in white
hoods. Joe and Phin now have to solve the murder – before the city
explodes. But Phin seems more interested in pinning the case on an
Indian – any Indian – than he is on solving the murder. And Joe – an
indigenous orphan who has neither the language nor the culture that the
Cahokians expect him to have – is reappraising his long habit of
deferring to Phin. This is the setup for a delicious whodunnit with a
large helping of what if…? but Spufford doesn’t stop there. Joe, you
see, is a jazz pianist, and his old bandmates are back in town, and one
thing leads to another and before you know it he’s sitting in with them
at a speakeasy. This gives Spufford a chance to roll out some of the
most evocative, delicious descriptions of jazz since Doctorow’s Ragtime
(no relation):
https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/41529/ragtime-by-e-l-doctorow/9780812978186
It’s not just the jazz. This is a book that fires on every cylinder:
there’s brilliant melee (and a major battle set-piece that’s stunning),
a love storyline, gunplay, and a murder mystery that kept me guessing
right to the end. There’s fakeouts and comeuppances, bravery and
treachery, and above all, a sense of possibility. Most of what I know
about Cahokia – and the giant mounds it left behind near St Louis – I
learned from David Graeber and David Wengrow’s brilliant work of
heterodox history, The Dawn of Everything:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/03/08/three-freedoms/#anti-fatalism Graeber
and Wengrow’s project is to make us reassess the blank spaces in our
historical record, the ways of living that we have merely guessed at,
based on fragments and suppositions. They point out that these
inferences are vastly overdetermined, and that there are many other
guesses that fit the facts equally well, or even better. This is a
powerful message, one that insists that history – and thus the future –
is contingent and up for grabs. We don’t have to live the way we do, and
we haven’t always lived this way. We might live differently in the
future. In evoking a teeming, indigenous metropolis, conjured out of
minor historical divergences, Spufford follows Graeber and Wengrow in
cracking apart inevitability and letting all the captive possibility
flow out. The fact that he does this in a first rate novel makes the
accomplishment doubly impressive – and enjoyable. Hey look at this

<li>Biden Administration Finalizes Strongest Federal Methane Regulations
Yet
</h3>
<p>
Speaking of methane, on Saturday
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/biden-epa-methane-rules" target="_self">the
Biden administration announced the finalization</a> of
long-in-the-making regulations that will rein in methane leaks from
existing and future oil and gas wells. The EPA says the rules will
prevent the equivalent of 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide from being
emitted between 2024 and 2038, almost as much as was emitted by all
power plants in the country in 2021. The total benefits created by the
new limits, the administration estimates, will reach $98 billion by
2038.

“The U.S. now has the most protective methane pollution limits on the
books,” said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund,
which has played a major role in exposing the dangers of methane.

<li><strong>New Report Puts Airplane Contrail Mitigation Efforts in
Doubt </strong>
</h3>
<p style=""></li>
</ol>
Airplane contrails — those white, vaporous ribbons that follow jets
across the sky — have long drawn scrutiny from environmental activists,
who’ve pointed to them as a major source of warming, saying the creation
of high clouds could trap heat in the atmosphere à la the greenhouse gas
effect. Boeing and NASA have been conducting test flights to explore if
sustainable aviation fuel could help limit contrails, while Google and
Bill Gates-funded Breakthrough Energy climate action group have
experimented with rerouting planes through regions of the atmosphere
that are less likely to induce contrails.
</p>
<p style>
But a new report by David Lee, an influential researcher of aviation and
climate who previously looked at the issue in a 2021 paper, has found
that “the fundamental premise” that contrails are concerning enough to
warrant mitigation investment “is not yet established,”
<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/nasa-and-boeing-chase-jet-contrails-with-science-of-climate-impact-in-doubt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The
Seattle Times</em> reports</a>. The science around contrails and the
climate is extremely complicated — that much is clear — but Lee writes
that it is so uncertain that efforts to limit contrails could actually
be “of limited effect” or even “have unintended consequences,” like
burning longer-lasting CO2 to reroute planes.
</p>
<p style>
Marc Shapiro of Breakthrough Energy, who is working to reduce contrails,
told the <em>Times</em>, “to be totally frank, our numbers are coming up
on the low end of David Lee’s [2021] estimates as well.”

As the global climate change summit COP28 continues, former Secretary of

insured in the face of climate change. Insurers are already pulling out
in parts of California and Florida, but what exactly would reforms to
the industry look like? Then, Venezuela votes to claim part of oil-rich
Guyana, and self-driving cars face quite a number of roadblocks.

Flying Tourists Over US National Parks Face New Rules</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Fewer planes and helicopters will be flying tourists over Mount
Rushmore and other national monuments and parks as new regulations take
effect that are intended to protect the serenity of some of the most
beloved natural areas in the United States.</p>
<p>The air tours have pitted tour operators against visitors frustrated
with the noise for decades, but it has come to a head as new management
plans are rolled out at nearly two dozen national parks and
monuments.</p>
<p>One of the strictest yet was recently announced at Mount Rushmore and
Badlands National Park, where tour flights will essentially be banned
from getting within a half mile of the South Dakota sites starting in
April.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what we’re going to be able to salvage,” complained
Mark Schlaefli, a co-owner of Black Hills Aerial Adventures who is
looking for alternative routes.</p>
<p>The regulations are the result of a federal appeals court finding
three years ago that the National Park Service and the Federal Aviation
Administration failed to enforce a 2000 law governing commercial air
tours over the parks and some tribal lands. A schedule was crafted for
setting rules, and many are wrapping up now.</p>
<p>But now an industry group is eying litigation, and an environmental
coalition already has sued over one plan. The issue has grown so
contentious that a congressional oversight hearing is planned for
Tuesday.</p>
<p>Critics argue that the whirr of chopper blades is drowning out the
sound of birds, bubbling lava and babbling brooks. That in turn disrupts
the experiences of visitors and the tribes who call the land around the
parks home.</p>
<p>“Is that fair?” asked Kristen Brengel of the National Parks
Conservation Association, noting that visitors on the ground far
outnumber those overhead. “I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>The air operators argue they provide unrivaled access, particularly
to the elderly and disabled.</p>
<p>“Absolutely exhilarating, a thrilling experience” is how Bailey Wood,
a spokesman for the Helicopter Association International, described
them.</p>
<p>Sightseeing flights got their start in the 1930s as crews building
the massive Hoover Dam asked the helicopter pilots working on the
project to give their families flyovers, Wood said.</p>
<p>“It took off from there,” he said, jokingly adding, “Sorry, aviation
pun.”</p>
<p>The issue hit a tipping point at the Grand Canyon in 1986 when two
tour aircraft collided over the national park in Arizona, killing 25
people. Congress acted the next year and a plan was enacted to designate
routes and minimum altitude for canyon flights.</p>
<p>Congress passed another round of legislation in 2000 with a goal of
setting rules in other national parks. But bureaucratic difficulties and
delays stalled compliance.</p>
<p>The Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility and the Hawaii
Island Coalition Malama Pono sued, demanding something be done.
Historically, some of the nation’s busiest spots for tour operators are
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which is home to one of the world’s most
active volcanoes, and Haleakala National Park.</p>
<p>In 2020, a federal court ordered compliance at 23 national parks,
including popular sites such as Glacier in Montana, Arches in Utah and
Great Smokey Mountains in Tennessee and North Carolina. That same year,
the latest in which data is available, there were 15,624 air tours
reported, which was down about 30% because of the pandemic, the park
service said.</p>
<p>As of this month, plans or voluntary agreements have been adopted for
most of the parks, although not all of them have taken effect. Work is
still underway on five, the park service said.</p>
<p>Parks exempted from developing plans include those with few flights
and those in Alaska, where small planes are often the only way to get
around.</p>
<p>“Mostly, the plans have been pretty generous to the industry,
allowing them to continue as they have done in the past with some
limited air tours around these parks,” said Peter Jenkins, senior
council for Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility.</p>
<p>His group went to court over a plan to allow a combined total of
about 2,500 flights over the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and
other nearby parks, alleging an inadequate environmental study.</p>
<p>Then came last month’s announcement about restrictions over Mount
Rushmore and the Badlands.</p>
<p>“This isn’t a management plan,” complained Ray Jilek, owner of Eagle
Aviation Inc. and its chief pilot. “This is a cease and desist plan, as
far as I’m concerned.”</p>
<p>Andrew Busse of Black Hills Helicopter Inc. said his tours already
don’t fly directly over Mount Rushmore. The park is relatively small, so
the monument to the nation’s presidents is still visible from outside
its boundaries, he said. </p>
<p>The plans are aimed at taking tribal desires into account. But Shawn
Bordeaux, a Democratic state lawmaker in South Dakota and a member of
the Rosebud Sioux tribe, said he hasn’t heard complaints.</p>
<p>“We don’t want them flying around trying to watch our sun dances or
ceremonies or something,” he said. “But as for tourism, I don’t see why
it’s an issue.” </p>
<p>A similarly strict plan has been proposed for Bandelier National
Monument in New Mexico. Bruce Adams, owner of Southwest Safaris, flies a
fixed-wing plane with tourists a couple times a week over the area known
for the dwellings carved into the soft rock cliffs.</p>
<p>“Changing the route is going to force me to fly over Pueblo tribal
lands that I have assiduously avoided doing for 49 years because I know
it’s going to cause noise problems,” he said.</p>
<p>Glacier National Park, meanwhile, is phasing out the flights by the
end of 2029. </p>
<p>Wood said the process has been “broken and rushed” and threatens to
put some operators out of business.</p>
<p>“Litigation is one tool that is definitely under consideration,” he
said.</p>
<p>But Brengel of the National Parks Conservation Association said the
resistance doesn’t have much traction. An amendment to the FAA
reauthorization bill that would have required the agency to factor in
the economics of commercial air tours over national parks failed in
July, she said.</p>
<p>“People go to Arches, people go to Hawaii to hear the sights and
sounds of these places,” Brengel said. “It’s so utterly clear that the
vast majority of people who are going to these parks aren’t going to
hear the sounds of helicopters over their heads.”</p>

of the plane I flew in. And thousands of other people at the airport and
on the plane, any of which could have attacked me. And all the people
that prepared and served my breakfast, and the entire food supply

Air Force: Divers Find Wreckage, Remains From Osprey Aircraft That
Crashed off Japan</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. and Japanese divers have discovered wreckage and remains of crew
members from a U.S. Air Force Osprey aircraft that crashed last week off
southwestern Japan, the Air Force announced Monday.</p>
<p>The CV-22 Osprey carrying eight American personnel crashed last
Wednesday off Yakushima Island during a training mission. The body of
one victim was recovered and identified earlier, while seven others
remained missing.</p>
<p>The Air Force Special Operations Command said the remains were being
recovered and their identities have yet to be determined.</p>
<p>“The main priority is bringing the Airmen home and taking care of
their family members. Support to, and the privacy of, the families and
loved ones impacted by this incident remains AFSOC’s top priority,” it
said in a statement.</p>
<p>The U.S. military identified the one confirmed victim as Air Force
Staff Sgt. Jacob Galliher of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, on Saturday.</p>
<p>On Monday, divers from the Japanese navy and U.S. military spotted
what appeared to be the front section of the Osprey, along with possibly
five of the missing crew members, Japan’s NHK public television and
other media reported. Japanese navy officials declined to confirm the
reports, saying they could not release details without consent from the
U.S.</p>
<p>The U.S.-made Osprey is a hybrid aircraft that takes off and lands
like a helicopter but can rotate its propellers forward and cruise much
faster, like an airplane, during flight.</p>
<p>Ospreys have had several crashes, including in Japan, where they are
used at U.S. and Japanese military bases, and the latest accident
rekindled safety concerns.</p>
<p>Japan has suspended all flights of its own fleet of 14 Ospreys.
Japanese officials say they have asked the U.S. military to resume
Osprey flights only after ensuring their safety. The Pentagon said no
such formal request has been made and that the U.S. military is
continuing to fly 24 MV-22s, the Marine version of Ospreys, deployed on
the southern Japanese island of Okinawa.</p>
<p>On Sunday, pieces of wreckage that Japan’s coast guard and local
fishing boats have collected were handed over to the U.S. military for
examination, coast guard officials said. Japan’s military said debris it
has collected would also be handed over to the U.S.</p>
<p>Coast guard officials said the recovered pieces of wreckage include
parts of the aircraft and an inflatable life raft but nothing related to
the cause of the crash, such as an engine. Local witnesses reported
seeing fire coming from one of the engines.</p>
<p>Under the Japan-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement, Japanese authorities
are not given the right to seize or investigate U.S. military property
unless the U.S. decides otherwise. That means it will be practically
impossible for Japan to independently investigate the cause of the
accident.</p>
<p>The agreement has often made Japanese investigations difficult in
criminal cases involving American service members on Okinawa and
elsewhere, and has been criticized as unequal by rights activists and
others, including Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki, who has called for a
revision.</p>

id="lacking-counselors-us-schools-turn-to-booming-business-of-online-therapy">Lacking
Counselors, US Schools Turn to Booming Business of Online Therapy</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Trouble with playground bullies started for Maria Ishoo’s daughter in
elementary school. Girls ganged up, calling her “fat” and “ugly.” Boys
tripped and pushed her. The California mother watched her typically
bubbly second-grader retreat into her bedroom and spend afternoons
curled up in bed.</p>
<p>For Valerie Aguirre’s daughter in Hawaii, a spate of middle school
“friend drama” escalated into violence and online bullying that left the
12-year-old feeling disconnected and lonely.</p>
<p>Both children received help through telehealth therapy, a service
that schools around the country are offering in response to soaring
mental health struggles among American youth.</p>
<p>Now at least 16 of the 20 largest U.S. public school districts are
offering online therapy sessions to reach millions of students,
according to an analysis by The Associated Press. In those districts
alone, schools have signed provider contracts worth more than $70
million.</p>
<p>The growth reflects a booming new business born from America’s youth
mental health crisis, which has proven so lucrative that venture
capitalists are funding a new crop of school teletherapy companies. Some
experts raise concerns about the quality of care offered by fast-growing
tech companies.</p>
<p>As schools cope with shortages of in-person practitioners, however,
educators say teletherapy works for many kids, and it’s meeting a
massive need. For rural schools and lower-income students in particular,
it has made therapy easier to access. Schools let students connect with
online counselors during the school day or after hours from home.</p>
<p>“This is how we can prevent people from falling through the cracks,”
said Ishoo, a mother of two in Lancaster, California.</p>
<p>Ishoo recalls standing at her second-grader’s bedroom door last year
and wishing she could get through to her. “What’s wrong?” the mother
would ask. The response made her heart heavy: “It’s NOTHING, Mom.”</p>
<p>Last spring, her school district launched a teletherapy program and
she signed up her daughter. During a month of weekly sessions, the girl
logged in from her bedroom and opened up to a therapist who gave her
coping tools and breathing techniques to reduce anxiety. The therapist
told her daughter: You are in charge of your own emotions. Don’t give
anyone else that control.</p>
<p>“She learned that it’s OK to ask for help, and sometimes everyone
needs some extra help,” Ishoo said.</p>
<p>The 13,000-student school system, like so many others, has counselors
and psychologists on staff, but not enough to meet the need, said Trish
Wilson, the Lancaster district’s coordinator of counselors.</p>
<p>Therapists in the area have full caseloads, making it impossible to
refer students for immediate care, she said. But students can schedule a
virtual session within days.</p>
<p>“Our preference is to provide our students in-person therapy.
Obviously, that’s not always possible,” said Wilson, whose district has
referred more than 325 students to over 800 sessions since launching the
online therapy program.</p>
<p>Students and their parents said in interviews they turned to
teletherapy after struggling with feelings of sadness, loneliness,
academic stress and anxiety. For many, the transition back to in-person
school after distance learning was traumatic. Friendships had fractured,
social skills deteriorated and tempers flared more easily.</p>
<p>Schools are footing the bill, many of them using federal pandemic
relief money as experts have warned of alarming rates of youth
depression, anxiety and suicide. Many school districts are signing
contracts with private companies. Others are working with local health
care providers, nonprofits or state programs.</p>
<p>Mental health experts welcome the extra support but caution about
potential pitfalls. For one, it’s getting harder to hire school
counselors and psychologists, and competition with telehealth providers
isn’t helping.</p>
<p>“We have 44 counselor vacancies, and telehealth definitely impacts
our ability to fill them,” said Doreen Hogans, supervisor of school
counseling in Prince George’s County, Maryland. Hogans estimates 20% of
school counselors who left have taken teletherapy jobs, which offer more
flexible hours.</p>
<p>The rapid growth of the companies raises questions about the
qualifications of the therapists, their experience with children and
privacy protocols, said Kevin Dahill-Fuchel, executive director of
Counseling in Schools, a nonprofit that helps schools bolster
traditional, in-person mental health services.</p>
<p>“As we give these young people access to telehealth, I want to hear
how all these other bases are covered,” he said.</p>
<p>One of the biggest providers, San Francisco-based Hazel Health,
started with telemedicine health services in schools in 2016 and
expanded to mental health in May 2021, CEO Josh Golomb said. It now
employs more than 300 clinicians providing teletherapy in over 150
school districts in 15 states.</p>
<p>The rapid expansions mean millions of dollars in revenue for Hazel.
This year, the company signed a $24 million contract with Los Angeles
County to offer teletherapy services to 1.3 million students for two
years.</p>
<p>Other clients include Hawaii, which is paying Hazel nearly $4 million
over three years to work with its public schools, and Clark County
schools in the Las Vegas area, which have allocated $3.25 million for
Hazel-provided teletherapy. The districts of Miami-Dade, Prince George’s
and Houston schools also have partnered with Hazel.</p>
<p>Despite the giant contracts, Golomb said Hazel is focused on ensuring
child welfare outweighs the bottom line.</p>
<p>“We have the ethos of a nonprofit company but we’re using a
private-sector mechanism to reach as many kids as we can,” Golomb said.
Hazel raised $51.5 million in venture capital funding in 2022 that
fueled its expansion. “Do we have any concerns about any compromise in
quality? The resounding answer is no.”</p>
<p>Other providers are getting into the space. In November, New York
City launched a free telehealth therapy service for teens to help
eliminate barriers to access, said Ashwin Vasan, the city’s health
commissioner. New York is paying the startup TalkSpace $26 million over
three years for a service allowing teens aged 13 to 17 to download an
app and connect with licensed therapists by phone, video or text.</p>
<p>Unlike other cities, New York is offering the service to all teens,
whether enrolled in private, public or home schools, or not in school at
all.</p>
<p>“I truly hope this normalizes and democratizes access to mental
health care for our young people,” Vasan said.</p>
<p>Many of Hawaii’s referrals come from schools in rural or remote
areas. Student clients have increased sharply in Maui since the deadly
August wildfires, said Fern Yoshida, who oversees teletherapy for the
state education department. So far this fall, students have logged 2,047
teletherapy visits, a three-fold increase from the same period last
year.</p>
<p>One of them was Valerie Aguirre’s daughter, whose fallout with two
friends turned physical last year in sixth grade, when one of the girls
slapped her daughter in the face. Aguirre suggested her daughter try
teletherapy. After two months of online therapy, “she felt better,”
Aguirre said, with a realization that everyone makes mistakes and
friendships can be mended.</p>
<p>In California, Ishoo says her daughter, now in third grade, is
relaying wisdom to her sister, who started kindergarten this year.</p>
<p>“She walks her little sister to class and tells her everything will
be OK. She’s a different person. She’s older and wiser. She reassures
her sister,” Ishoo said. “I heard her say, ‘If kids are being mean to
you, just ignore them.’”</p>

id="despite-ukraine-war-needs-arms-sales-troubled-by-production-woes">Despite
Ukraine War Needs, Arms Sales Troubled by Production Woes</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Many Western arms companies failed to ramp up production in 2022
despite a strong increase in demand for weapons and military equipment,
a watchdog group said Monday, adding that labor shortages, soaring costs
and supply chain disruptions had been exacerbated by Russia’s invasion
of Ukraine.</p>
<p>In its Top 100 of such firms, the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute, or SIPRI, said the arms revenue of the world’s
largest arms-producing and military services companies last year stood
at $597 billion — a 3.5% drop from 2021.</p>
<p>“Many arms companies faced obstacles in adjusting to production for
high-intensity warfare,” said Lucie Beraud-Sudreau, director of the
independent institute’s Military Expenditure and Arms Production
Program.</p>
<p>SIPRI said the revenues of the 42 U.S. companies on the list —
accounting for 51% of total arms sales — fell by 7.9% to $302 billion in
2022. Of those, 32 recorded a fall in year-on-year arms revenue, most of
them citing ongoing supply chain issues and labor shortages stemming
from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Nan Tian, a senior researcher with SIPRI, said that “we are beginning
to see an influx of new orders linked to the war in Ukraine.”</p>
<p>He cited some major U.S. companies, including Lockheed Martin and
Raytheon Technologies, and said that because of “existing order backlogs
and difficulties in ramping up production capacity, the revenue from
these orders will probably only be reflected in company accounts in two
to three years’ time.”</p>
<p>Companies in Asia and the Middle East saw their arms revenues grow
significantly in 2022, the institute said in its assessment, saying it
demonstrated “their ability to respond to increased demand within a
shorter time frame.” SIPRI singled out Israel and South Korea.</p>
<p>“However, despite the year-on-year drop, the total Top 100 arms
revenue was still 14% higher in 2022 than in 2015 — the first year for
which SIPRI included Chinese companies in its ranking.</p>
<p>SIPRI also said that countries placed new orders late in the year and
the time lag between orders and production meant that the surge in
demand was not reflected in these companies’ 2022 revenues.</p>
<p>“However, new contracts were signed, notably for ammunition, which
could be expected to translate into higher revenue in 2023 and beyond,”
Beraud-Sudreau said.</p>
