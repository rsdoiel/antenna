## How I'm using AI as a technical writer

date: 2024-10-30, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

<p>I’ve been using large language models (LLMs) for a while now. They accelerate and improve my output at work, to the point that losing access to them would make me feel slightly impaired in some areas. Rather than fearing <em>WriterBot</em>, I&rsquo;m embracing the additional capabilities it grants. At the same time, I&rsquo;m extremely conscious of their limitations, <a href="https://passo.uno/ai-anxiety-tech-writer-howto/">which are abundant</a>. Let me tell you how LLMs are helping me in my everyday work as a documentation engineer and where they&rsquo;re unable to assist me.</p>

## How Low Can You Go?

date: 2024-10-30, from: Retro Innovations blog

Understanding lowercase functionality on the Motorola MC6847 Video Display Generator (VDG) I&#8217;ll be honest, I rarely use lowercase characters on any of the classic computers I use. Back in the day, of course, I needed them when writing posts on BBS systems, composing school papers, and writing general correspondence (my handwriting was never great).
