you revise something you’ve already written or created. But it looks

“Cause and effect assume history marches forward, but history is not an
army. It is a crab scuttling sideways, a drip of soft water wearing away
a stone, an earthquake breaking centuries of tension. Sometimes one
person inspires a movement, or her words do decades later; sometimes a
few passionate people change the world; sometimes they start a mass
movement and millions do; sometimes those millions are stirred by the
same outage or the same ideal, and the change comes upon us like a
change of weather. All that these transformations have in common is that
they begin in hope. To hope is to gamble. It’s to bet on the future, on
your desires, on the possibility that an open heart and uncertainty is
better than gloom and safety. To hope is dangerous, and yet it is the
opposite of fear, for to live is to risk.”

applications – one for creating and editing text-based documents and the
other for creating simple graphics. But that’s starting to change.

Index Issues</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-07, from: Michael Tsai</p>
<p>Kuba Suder: CloudKit also automatically creates indexes for each
field in each record type - when you’re done with development, you can
delete some indexes that you won’t need so they don’t waste space in the
production database. Apple: A request to fetch records performs a query
on indexed fields for a particular record type. […]</p>

Concurrency Patterns</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-07, from: Michael Tsai</p>
<p>Matt Massicotte: I think the vast majority of the time, a global
actor should be applied to the type as a whole, not to individual
properties.[…]But, while detached does prevent isolation inheritance, it
also does other stuff too. Detached tasks do not inherit priority or
task-local values. Instead, think about a nonisolated function.[…]I
think MainActor.run […]</p>

<p>Joe Rosensteel: It doesn’t list interactions for things that are not
in the medication app, like vitamin supplements, antacids, NSAID
painkillers, etc. All of which had very clear, urgent warnings in the
prescription paperwork, but because they aren’t the two medications in
the app there’s no warning. […] Despite being able to OCR the

<p>Federico Viticci: When you start observing another person’s screen in
iOS 18, the system will tell you that you can now tap and draw on their
screen. Taps are drawn as purple circles that disappear quickly –
they’re subtle, but noticeable. […] With the ability to control another
