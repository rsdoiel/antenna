Johansson says she is ‘shocked, angered’ over new ChatGPT voice</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>Lawyers for Scarlett Johansson are demanding that OpenAI disclose how
it developed an AI personal assistant voice that the actress says sounds
uncannily similar to her own. Johansson’s legal team has sent OpenAI two
letters asking the company to detail the process by which it developed a
voice the tech company dubbed “Sky,” Johansson’s publicist told NPR in a
revelation that has not been previously reported. ↫ Bobby Allyn at NPR
This story highlights just how much disdain techbros have for the work
of creative people. Here’s the timeline: Techbros like Sam Altman deeply
despise and undervalue the work of creatives, believing human creativity
to be merely an equation to be solved, definable by an algorithm. To
people like him, creative work has no value, and as such, is up for
grabs to be taken and cut up for his algorithms to spit out as “new”
works. This story highlights this perfectly. The sleaze runs deep with
Altman and OpenAI.</p>

two companies can tell us about two corners of the economy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
On Wednesday, we get glimpses of two very different ends of the economy:
Both retailer Target and AI chipmaker Nvidia report earnings. One lives
in the world of consumers facing high interest rates, while the other
occupies the sphere of cutting edge technology. What can we anticipate?
Then, caregiving is a major factor behind the rise of multigenerational
households in the U.S. We’ll hear from one family who came to live
together.

Houston residents are once again rebuilding after a severe windstorm

just beginning to assess the extent of the damage — at a time when
insurance is getting pricier and harder to find. Then, the FDIC’s chair
says he will step down once a successor is confirmed following
investigations into toxic culture at the agency. Plus, can legislation
save local news?

<p>
A group of Tesla shareholders including New York City Comptroller Brad
Lander, SOC Investment Group, Amalgamated Bank, and others, have written
to company investors urging them to vote against CEO Elon Musk’s $56
billion pay package next month, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>

“Even as Tesla’s performance is floundering, the board has yet to ensure
that Tesla has a full-time CEO who is adequately focused on the
long-term sustainable success of our company,” the shareholder group
wrote. Shareholders will vote at the company’s annual meeting on June 13
on whether to re-ratify Musk’s 2018 pay package, which a judge voided in
January. The letter also says shareholders should not vote to re-elect
board members Kimbal Musk (Elon’s brother) and James Murdoch (Elon’s
friend), suggesting they are too closely tied to the CEO.

to</a> the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Annual railway
electricity usage has hovered around 7,000 Gigawatt hours (GWh) since
2003, making it the largest electricity end-use category in the
transportation sector. But that changed last year when EVs took the top
spot, using 7,596 GWh. The EIA notes this is nearly five times the
amount of electricity EVs consumed in 2018. The numbers underscore two
trends: the limited expansion of U.S. rail, and the explosive growth of
EV sales.

From the BBC World Service: Artificial intelligence has been argued to
be the tech of our time, and lawmakers have been grappling with how to
regulate it. Today, the European Union approved what it says is the
first AI law of its kind in the world. Plus, we hear how Japanese
authorities are clamping down on tiresome tourists. And why has the U.S.

expects South Korea and Japan to manage ties with China at summit amid
growing differences</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Ahead of a trilateral summit involving South Korea,
Japan, and China this weekend in Seoul, Washington said it expects the
event to be an opportunity for its two allies to manage their relations
with Beijing.</p>
<p>“The United States respects the ability of nations to make sovereign
decisions in the best interests of their people,” said a spokesperson
for the State Department.</p>
<p>“Just as the United States takes steps to responsibly manage our
relationship with the PRC, so do our partners and allies,” the
spokesperson continued in an email to VOA’s Korean Service on May 15.
The People’s Republic of China (PRC) is China’s official name.</p>
<p>The summit would come amid a heightened tension between Washington
and Beijing over trade  and after China agreed with Russia to establish
a “new era” partnership to create “a multipolar world order” during
their summit last week.</p>
<p>The three East Asian countries are expected to hold their summit from
May 26 to 27, but the official dates have not been announced. Chinese
Premier Li Qiang is expected to attend in place of Chinese President Xi
Jinping to meet with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Japanese
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.</p>
<p>The meeting would be their first trilateral summit since December
2019.</p>
<p>Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington,
told VOA on May 14 that Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul should be main drivers
responsible for regional stability and security.</p>
<p>Pointing out what Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said after a
trilateral foreign ministers meeting in November, Pengyu said the three
countries need to “address differences and disputes in peaceful ways”
and “act as front runner of East Asia cooperation.”</p>
<p>Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing are planning to discuss trade and
investment, peace and security, and science and technology, among other
items and include in a joint statement their cooperation on economic
issues and infectious diseases, according to the Japan Times, citing
Japanese government sources Sunday.</p>
<p>Former U.S. officials said while it will be important for the three
countries to meet and talk at the summit, differences that Seoul and
Tokyo have with Beijing on North Korea are unlikely to be resolved.</p>
<p>“With China determined to establish a new China-centric regional
order and because of Beijing’s open-ended support for the DPRK, we
should not expect progress on this issue,” said Evans Revere, a State
Department official with extensive experience negotiating with North
Korea.</p>
<p>North Korea’s official name is the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea (DPRK).</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, it is important for South Korea and Japan to use this
summit to convey their strong concerns,” Revere continued.</p>
<p>At a bilateral summit last week, Beijing and Moscow criticized
Washington and its allies for their “intimidation in the military
sphere” against North Korea.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Zhao Leji, who ranks third in the Chinese Communist Party, visited
Pyongyang in April and agreed with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to
boost cooperation on mutual concerns. It was the highest-level talks the
two countries had held in years.</p>
<p>The upcoming summit comes after trilateral cooperation was agreed
among Washington, Seoul and Tokyo at their Camp David summit in August
2023 to strengthen their deterrence against North Korean threats and to
defend a free and open Indo-Pacific against Chinese aggressions.</p>
<p>Joseph DeTrani, who served as the U.S. special envoy for six-party
denuclearization talks with North Korea from 2003 to 2006, said, “China
will ask that the ROK and Japan not to align with the U.S. against
China, an issue that wasn’t on the table in 2019.”</p>
<p>South Korea’s official name is the Republic of Korea (ROK).</p>
<p>DeTrani said Seoul and Tokyo will “try to get China to convince North
Korea to cease providing arms to Russia for its war in Ukraine” and “to
use its leverage” with Pyongyang “to halt ballistic missile
launches.”</p>
<p>Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of Kim Jong Un, denied Pyongyang’s
arms dealings with Moscow, according to state-run KCNA on Friday. The
same day, North Korea launched a tactical ballistic missile, said
KCNA. </p>
<p>Gary Samore, who served as the White House coordinator for arms
control and weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration,
said the summit will become “an opportunity for communication” among
Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing to avoid conflict, but the differences that
grew among them since 2019 will not be resolved as South Korea and Japan
“leaned in the direction of cooperating with the U.S.”</p>

extreme positions. Rather than trying to appeal to swing voters, he

id="why-the-biden-white-house-chose-kenya-for-its-first-state-visit-by-an-african-leader">Why
the Biden White House chose Kenya for its first state visit by an
African leader</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The White House — The White House says it chose Kenya for its first
state visit by an African leader for many reasons — not least because
the East African powerhouse has stepped up on the global stage, offering
to staff a United Nations peacekeeping mission to Haiti that could see
boots on the ground as early as this week.</p>
<p>VOA White House correspondent Anita Powell sat down with Frances
Brown, the newly appointed director for African affairs at the National
Security Council, ahead of a state visit by Kenyan President William
Ruto. They discussed a range of issues, including technology, climate
management, debt relief, democracy, health and more.</p>
<p>The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.</p>
<p>VOA: In a few days, President Joe Biden hosts Kenyan President
William Ruto at the White House, his first African leader for a state
visit. Why was Kenya chosen and what deliverables can we expect?</p>
<p>Frances Brown, NSC director for African affairs: We chose Kenya for a
few reasons. No. 1 is the Kenya-U.S. partnership has really grown from a
regionally focused one to a globally focused one. … and we see a lot of
complementarities in terms of what we’re trying to do on climate. What
we’re trying to do on debt for the developing world, and on security
issues.</p>
<p>The second reason we wanted to have this state visit with Kenya is
that we are both democracies, and our bond is very deep as democracies,
and our bond is very deep on people-to-people ties.</p>
<p>The third reason is that Kenya and the U.S. really work similarly in
terms of bringing in the private sector to solve global challenges. So,
we’ll be talking a lot about those. The deliverables you’ll see are in
the realms of technology, clean energy and climate transition, of debt
relief, of democracy, of people-to-people ties and on health-related
issues.</p>
<p>VOA: Kenya hopes to soon have peacekeepers in Haiti. Why is this so
important to the administration?</p>
<p>Brown: We do really welcome the Kenyans raising their hand to help
lead this multinational security support mission in Haiti, because it’s
kind of an example of what I just mentioned of Kenya raising its hand to
solve problems even outside of its region. … As you may know, there’s
been planning under way for a number of months. It has included policing
experts from around the world working to develop a concept of
operations. Kenya is not going it alone. The U.S. has provided $300
million towards this, so it’s a big thing for us.</p>
<p>VOA: Are there any other security agreements these two countries
might come up with during the state visit?</p>
<p>Brown: I would say watch this space, because I think security
cooperation with Kenya is a really important plank.</p>
<p>VOA: Is it going to be focused on threats from Somalia or from other
parts of East Africa?</p>
<p>Brown: The U.S. and Kenya have long cooperated on Somalia. I think
you can look for security-related announcements that go beyond that.</p>
<p>VOA: U.S. troops are pulling out of the Sahel and the so-called “Coup
Belt.” What are the concerns the administration has about security in
the Sahel region, especially as Russia expands its footprint there?</p>
<p>Brown: As has been widely reported, we are making an orderly
withdrawal from Niger. I will say that is pretty consistent with our
administration’s [counterterrorism] posture in general that we have made
changes to our posture that are consistent with our CT policy. It is no
secret that democracy is on the backfoot in a lot of places
globally.</p>
<p>If you talk to democracy scholars, democracy is on something like its
20th year of global decline. So, Africa is not alone in this regard. The
Biden administration is focused on lifting up and partnering with
democracies to help them deliver.</p>
<p>You may have seen USAID’s initiative on democracy delivering. We’re
working with a few African countries on that. And I think this is,
again, something that we’ll be talking a lot to the Kenyans with,
because President Ruto has talked about the imperative of democracy
delivering.</p>
<p>VOA: Regarding issues of trade and the African Growth and Opportunity
Act — obviously, this is going to be a decision made by Congress, but
how does the administration feel about the benefits of trade and of
barrier-free trade with the United States?</p>
<p>Brown: President Biden has been really vocal that he sees AGOA
reauthorization and AGOA modernization as a huge priority. It has been
huge, I think from our perspective, but also from the perspective of the
region. It’s something we hear a lot about from our Kenyan partners. We
do look to Congress for that. But as you know, reauthorization is due
next year, and obviously we hope that things can get in motion before
then.</p>
<p>VOA: The President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief — which has been
a literal lifesaver for people around the African continent — is up for
renewal next year. How does the White House see this program as
contributing to national security?</p>
<p>Brown: We see PEPFAR as essential. And as you know, PEPFAR has been
supported with bipartisan congressional support and across
administrations since the George W. Bush initiative initially. We think
PEPFAR is delivering for people across the continent, and we’ve been
proud to support it, and we look for reauthorization.</p>
<p>VOA: When is President Biden going to visit Africa, and where will he
go?</p>
<p>Brown: So, I cannot make news at this moment by announcing
presidential travel. But what I will say is thus far, I think President
Biden’s commitment to the relationship with the continent is pretty
clear. If you think about Kenya, it’s the first state visit that we’re
giving to a non-G20 country this term. There’s only been five other
state visits. … But then you just look at the steady stream of Cabinet
official travels to the continent over the past two years — by our
count, there’s 24 principals or Cabinet-level officials who’ve made that
trip, all of them bringing their own agenda.</p>
<p>I’d also say just in terms of the other ways President Biden has
shown his commitment, advocating for AU [African Union] membership with
the G20 has been huge. Advocating for more African seats and

<p>VOA: You’ve just joined the NSC in this capacity. What priorities do
you bring to this post?</p>
<p>Brown: I think I see this post as moving forward on the affirmative
agenda that President Biden laid out first, and the Sub-Saharan Africa
Strategy, which was published at the end of 2021. Then the African
Leaders Summit, which came at the end of 2022. There were a lot of
initiatives launched by those two events. Now we are running forward on
implementation.</p>
<p>At the same time, of course, at the NSC, the urgent sometimes
competes with the important, so of course, we’re seized with managing
crises. And we’re really sobered by the crises that are happening in
many parts of the continent. So, I see my role as a balance between
those two, and I’m thrilled to be on board.</p>

<h2 id="head-of-us-deposit-insurance-agency-to-step-down">Head of US
deposit insurance agency to step down</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — The White House said Monday that the chairman of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation would step down, a departure that
will follow the release this month of a damning report about the
agency’s toxic workplace culture.</p>
<p>The White House said Martin Gruenberg would step down once a
successor was appointed and that President Joe Biden would name a
replacement “soon.” The announcement came after the top Democrat on the
Senate Banking Committee earlier Monday called for Gruenberg’s
removal.</p>
<p>Biden expects the FDIC “to reflect the values of decency and
integrity and to protect the rights and dignity of all employees,”
deputy press secretary Sam Michel said in a statement.</p>
<p>The FDIC is one of several U.S. banking system regulators. The Great
Depression-era agency is best known for running the nation’s deposit
insurance program, which insures Americans’ deposits up to $250,000 in
case their banks fail.</p>
<p>Before Monday, no Democrats had called for Gruenberg’s ouster,
although several came very close to doing so. But Senator Sherrod Brown,
the top Democrat on the Banking Committee, who is facing a tough
reelection campaign, issued a statement Monday calling for Gruenberg to
step down, saying his leadership at the FDIC could no longer be
trusted.</p>
<p>Gruenberg was grilled for two days last week on Capitol Hill in
hearings largely focused on the FDIC’s workplace culture and the
failures disclosed in the report prepared by an outside law firm.</p>
<p>“After chairing last week’s hearing, reviewing the independent report
and receiving further outreach from FDIC employees … , I am left with
one conclusion: There must be fundamental changes at the FDIC,” Brown
said in a statement.</p>
<p>Republicans have been calling for Gruenberg’s ouster for some time
and criticized the White House for not calling for his immediate
departure.</p>
<p>Gruenberg has held various leadership positions at the FDIC for
nearly 20 years, and this was his second full term as FDIC chair. His
long tenure at the agency made him largely responsible for the agency’s
toxic work environment, according to the report outlining the problems
at the agency.</p>
<p>The report released last Tuesday by law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen
&amp; Hamilton cites incidents of stalking, harassment, homophobia and
other violations of employment regulations, based on more than 500
complaints from employees.</p>
<p>Among the complaints: a woman said she was stalked by a coworker and
continually harassed even after complaining about his behavior; a field
office supervisor referred to gay men as “little girls”; and a female
field examiner  described receiving a picture of an FDIC senior
examiner’s private parts.</p>

<h2 id="xeon-phi-support-removed-in-gcc-15-compiler">Xeon Phi support
removed in GCC 15 compiler</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Last week I wrote about Intel aiming to remove Xeon Phi support in
GCC 15 with the products being end-of-life and deprecated in GCC 14.
While some openly wondered whether the open-source community would allow
it given the Xeon Phi accelerators were available to buy just a few
years ago and at some very low prices going back years so some
potentially finding use still out of them especially during this AI boom
(and still readily available to buy used for around ~$50 USD), today the
Intel Xeon Phi support was indeed removed. ↫ Michael Larabel Xeon Phi
PCIe cards are incredibly cheap on eBay, and every now and then my mouse
hovers over the buy button – but I always realise just in time that the
cards have become quite difficult to use, since support for them,
already sparse to begin with, is only getting worse by the day. Support
for them was already removed in Linux 5.10, and now GCC is pulling he
plug too, so the only option is to keep using old kernels, or pass the
card on to a VM running an older Linux kernel version, which is a lot of
headache for what is essentially a weird toy for nerds at this point.
GCC 15 will also, sadly, remove support for Itanium, which, as I’ve said
before, is a huge disgrace and a grave mistake. Itanium is the future,
and will stomp all over crappy architectures like x86 and ARM. With this
deprecation, GCC relegates itself to the dustbin of history.</p>

<h2 id="modernizing-the-antennapod-code-structure">Modernizing the
AntennaPod code structure</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>AntennaPod has been around for a long time – the first bit of code
was published in 2011. Since then, the app has grown massively and had
several main developers. The beauty of open-source is that so many
people can contribute and make a great app together. But sometimes
having many people work on a project can lead to different ways of
thinking about how to structure the project. Because of this, AntennaPod
gradually grew to have a number of weird code constructs. Our latest
release, version 3.4, fixes this. ↫ ByteHamster The AntennaPod team had
an incredible task ahead of itself, and while it took them a few years,
they pulled it off. The code structure graphs from before and after the
code restructuring illustrate better than words ever could what they
achieved. Thy changed 10000 lines of source code in 62 pull requests for
this restructuring alone, while still adding new major features in the
meantime. Pretty incredible.</p>

id="microsoft-gives-windows-new-compiler-kernel-scheduler-and-x86-translation-layer-on-arm">Microsoft
gives Windows new compiler, kernel, scheduler, and x86 translation layer
on ARM</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft’s developer conference Build is taking place this week, so
there’s been some major Windows news and announcements, and for once –
we’re not talking about more ads in your operating system, or even “AI”
shoehorned into, I don’t know, Phone Dialer or Windows Fax and Scan.
First and foremost, Windows is going to get a new compiler, kernel, and
scheduler, but despite such massive low-level changes, the marketing
version number won’t jump from 11 to 12. Of course, we all know the
marketing version number has nothing to do with the actual Windows NT
version number, which currently sits at 10. The Windows NT version
number, meanwhile, is actually also meaningless, since it magically
jumps around left and right too, going from 6.2 to 10 between Windows
8.1 and Windows 10, where it has stayed ever since. “We really focused
on modernizing this update of Windows 11,” said Microsoft Corporate Vice
President of Windows and Devices Pavan Davuluri at a technical briefing
on Microsoft’s campus in mid-April. “We engineered this update of
Windows 11 with a real focus on AI inference and taking advantage of the
Arm64 instruction set at every layer of the operating system stack. For
us, what this meant really was building a new compiler in Windows. We
built a new kernel in Windows on top of that compiler. We now have new
schedulers in the operating system that take advantage of these new SoC
architecture.” ↫ Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica The focus is clearly
on ARM here, which coincides with the launch of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X
Elite, a new SoC that finally seems to truly make ARM laptops that
aren’t from Apple a real, competitive thing – so much so that Qualcomm
is even breaking with tradition and taking Linux support very seriously
for this new chip. Microsoft also unveiled the name for its new x86
translation layer for Windows on ARM: Prism. Microsoft told Ars Technica
that Prism is as fast as Apple’s Rosetta 2, which is interesting because
Apple’s M series chips contain special silicon to speed up the
translation process, making me wonder if Qualcomm has done the same, or
is just brute-forcing it. Performance like this means the apps customers
love work great. Microsoft has partnered closely with developers across
the globe to optimize their applications for this processor. In
addition, the powerful new Prism emulation engine delivers a 2x
performance boost compared to Surface Pro 9 with 5G. On the new Surface
Pro and Surface Laptop, powered by Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X
Plus processors, experiences like Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft 365
and Chrome will feel snappy, quick and responsive. ↫ Pete Kyriacou on
the Windows blog The new Windows on ARM machines using the Snapdragon X
Elite will be marketed under the new Copilot+ brand name, which brings
with it some requirements, the biggest of which is the neural processing
unit: it must be capable of at least 40 trillion operations per second.
At the time of writing, the only Windows-capable processor that can
boast such numbers is, of course, the new Snapdragon X Elite. AMD and
Intel need not apply. They simply cannot match this. Microsoft tied a
bow on all this stuff by unveiling the new Surface Pro and new Surface
Laptop, both powered by the new Snapdragon SoCs. You can preorder them
today, but they won’t be available until 18 June.</p>

<h2 id="us-agency-warns-of-increasing-cyberattacks-on-water-systems">US
agency warns of increasing cyberattacks on water systems</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Cyberattacks against U.S. water utilities are becoming
more frequent and more severe, the Environmental Protection Agency
warned Monday as it issued an enforcement alert urging water systems to
take immediate protective action. </p>
<p>About 70% of utilities inspected by federal officials over the last
year violated standards meant to prevent breaches or other intrusions,
the agency said. Officials urged even small water systems to improve
protections against hacks. Recent cyberattacks by groups affiliated with
Russia and Iran have targeted smaller communities. </p>
<p>Some water systems are falling short in basic ways, the alert said,
including failure to change default passwords or cut off system access
to former employees. Because water utilities often rely on computer
software to operate treatment plants and distribution systems,
protecting information technology and process controls is crucial, the
EPA said.</p>
<p>Possible impacts of cyberattacks include interruptions to water
treatment and storage; damage to pumps and valves; and alteration of
chemical levels to hazardous amounts, the agency said. </p>
<p>“In many cases, systems are not doing what they are supposed to be
doing, which is to have completed a risk assessment of their
vulnerabilities that includes cybersecurity and to make sure that plan
is available and informing the way they do business,” said EPA Deputy
Administrator Janet McCabe. </p>
<p>Attempts by private groups or individuals to get into a water
provider’s network and take down or deface websites aren’t new. More
recently, however, attackers have targeted utilities’ operations. </p>
<p>Geopolitical rivals</p>
<p>Recent attacks are not just by private entities. Some recent hacks of
water utilities are linked to geopolitical rivals and could lead to the
disruption of the supply of safe water to homes and businesses. </p>
<p>McCabe named China, Russia and Iran as the countries that are
“actively seeking the capability to disable U.S. critical
infrastructure, including water and wastewater.” </p>
<p>Late last year, an Iranian-linked group called “Cyber Av3ngers”
targeted multiple organizations including a small Pennsylvania town’s
water provider, forcing it to switch from a remote pump to manual
operations. They were going after an Israeli-made device used by the
utility in the wake of Israel’s war against Hamas. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, a Russian-linked “hacktivist” tried to disrupt
operations at several Texas utilities. </p>
<p>A cyber group linked to China and known as Volt Typhoon has
compromised information technology of multiple critical infrastructure
systems, including drinking water, in the United States and its
territories, U.S. officials said. Cybersecurity experts believe the
China-aligned group is positioning itself for potential cyberattacks in
the event of armed conflict or rising geopolitical tensions. </p>
<p>“By working behind the scenes with these hacktivist groups, now these
[nation states] have plausible deniability and they can let these groups
carry out destructive attacks. And that to me is a game changer,” said
Dawn Cappelli, a cybersecurity expert with the risk management firm
Dragos Inc. </p>
<p>The world’s cyberpowers are believed to have been infiltrating
rivals’ critical infrastructure for years, planting malware that could
be triggered to disrupt basic services. </p>
<p>The enforcement alert is meant to emphasize the seriousness of
cyberthreats and inform utilities the EPA will continue its inspections
and pursue civil or criminal penalties if they find serious
problems. </p>
<p>“We want to make sure that we get the word out to people that, ‘Hey,
we are finding a lot of problems here,’” McCabe said. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Broader federal effort</p>
<p>Preventing attacks against water providers is part of the Biden
administration’s broader effort to combat threats against critical
infrastructure. In February, President Joe Biden signed an executive
order to protect U.S. ports. Health care systems have been attacked. The
White House has pushed electric utilities to increase their defenses,
too. EPA Administrator Michael Regan and White House national security
adviser Jake Sullivan have asked states to come up with a plan to combat
cyberattacks on drinking water systems. </p>
<p>“Drinking water and wastewater systems are an attractive target for
cyberattacks because they are a lifeline critical infrastructure sector
but often lack the resources and technical capacity to adopt rigorous
cybersecurity practices,’’ Regan and Sullivan wrote in a March 18 letter
to all 50 U.S. governors. </p>
<p>Some of the fixes are straightforward, McCabe said. Water providers,
for example, shouldn’t use default passwords. They need to develop a
risk assessment plan that addresses cybersecurity and set up backup
systems. The EPA says it will train water utilities that need help for
free. Larger utilities usually have more resources and the expertise to
defend against attacks. </p>
<p>“In an ideal world … we would like everybody to have a baseline level
of cybersecurity and be able to confirm that they have that,” said Alan
Roberson, executive director of the Association of State Drinking Water
Administrators. “But that’s a long ways away.” </p>
<p>Some barriers are foundational. The water sector is highly
fragmented. There are roughly 50,000 community water providers, most of
which serve small towns. Modest staffing and anemic budgets in many
places make it hard enough to maintain the basics — providing clean
water and keeping up with the latest regulations. </p>
<p>“Certainly, cybersecurity is part of that, but that’s never been
their primary expertise. So, now you’re asking a water utility to
develop this whole new sort of department” to handle cyberthreats, said
Amy Hardberger, a water expert at Texas Tech University. </p>
<p>States, industry groups object</p>
<p>The EPA has faced setbacks. States periodically review the
performance of water providers. In March 2023, the EPA instructed states
to add cybersecurity evaluations to those reviews. If they found
problems, the state was supposed to force improvements. </p>
<p>But Missouri, Arkansas and Iowa, joined by the American Water Works
Association and another water industry group, challenged the
instructions in court on the ground that EPA didn’t have the authority
under the Safe Drinking Water Act. After a court setback, the EPA
withdrew its requirements but urged states to take voluntary actions
anyway. </p>
<p>The Safe Drinking Water Act requires certain water providers to
develop plans for some threats and certify they’ve done so. But its
power is limited. </p>
<p>“There’s just no authority for [cybersecurity] in the law,” said
Roberson. </p>
<p>Kevin Morley, manager of federal relations with the American Water
Works Association, said some water utilities have components that are
connected to the internet — a common but significant vulnerability.
Overhauling those systems can be a significant and costly job. And
without substantial federal funding, water systems struggle to find
resources. </p>
<p>The industry group has published guidance for utilities and advocates
for establishing a new organization of cybersecurity and water experts
that would develop new policies and enforce them, in partnership with
the EPA. </p>
<p>“Let’s bring everybody along in a reasonable manner,” Morley said,
adding that small and large utilities have different needs and
resources.</p>

<h2 id="us-2024-election-what-to-expect-in-kentuckys-primaries">US 2024
election: What to expect in Kentucky’s primaries</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — All of Donald Trump’s top opponents for the Republican
nomination for president dropped out of the race weeks ago, but the
whole gang will be back together on Kentucky’s primary ballot
Tuesday.</p>
<p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley,
entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former New Jersey Governor Chris
Christie all suspended their campaigns after Kentucky finalized its
ballot in January, as did pastor Ryan Binkley.</p>
<p>Trump has easily won nearly every Republican contest so far, but
Haley has won a significant number of votes in several recent primaries,
including Maryland (20%) and Nebraska (18%) this week.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden’s opponents in Kentucky are author Marianne
Williamson and U.S. Representative Dean Phillips. Democrats can also
vote for “uncommitted,” which has attracted protest votes in other
states.</p>
<p>Kentucky voters will also decide six primaries for the U.S. House.
One race to watch is the 4th Congressional District Republican primary.
Representative Thomas Massie, who backed DeSantis’ presidential bid and
co-sponsored a motion to remove House Speaker Mike Johnson, is facing a
challenge from Eric Deters, a staunch Trump supporter. However, Deters
hadn’t reported raising any money as of the latest filing deadline and
placed fourth in the 2023 gubernatorial primary.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at what to expect on Tuesday. </p>
<p>Primary day</p>
<p>Kentucky will hold presidential primaries and will also choose
nominees for the U.S. House, the state legislature and the state Senate.
Polls will close locally at 6 p.m. across the state. However, Kentucky
is nearly cut in half by time zones; most of it falls in the Eastern
time zone, while 41 counties in the western part of the state are on
Central time.  </p>
<p>Who gets to vote </p>
<p>Kentucky has a closed primary system, which means that only voters
registered with a political party may participate in that party’s
primary. Democrats may not vote in the Republican primary or vice versa.
Independent or unaffiliated voters may not participate in either
primary.</p>
<p>Delegate allocation rules</p>
<p>Kentucky Republicans allocate their 46 delegates proportionally to
any candidate who receives more than 15% of the vote, meaning any of
Trump’s opponents could qualify for delegates. They could also splinter
the anti-Trump vote, increasing Trump’s chances of being the only
candidate to receive 15% of the vote and therefore the only candidate to
receive any delegates. </p>
<p>Kentucky’s 53 pledged Democratic delegates are allocated according to
the national party’s standard rules. Twelve at-large delegates are
allocated in proportion to the statewide vote, as are six PLEO
delegates, or “party leaders and elected officials.” The state’s six
congressional districts have a combined 35 delegates at stake, which are
allocated in proportion to the vote results in each district. Candidates
must receive at least 15% of the statewide vote to qualify for any
statewide delegates, and 15% of the vote in a congressional district to
qualify for delegates in that district. </p>
<p>Decision notes </p>
<p>While Republican state parties that hold primaries this late in the
cycle tend to embrace a winner-takes-all system for delegate allocation,
Kentucky Republicans are dividing their delegates proportionally among
candidates who receive at least 15% of the vote. </p>
<p>For signs that a candidate not named Trump could reach that 15%
threshold, look to suburban areas like Louisville and Lexington. Those
areas — Jefferson and Fayette counties — are also the biggest sources of
GOP votes in the state. </p>
<p>In the 2020 presidential primary, “uncommitted” and Trump were the
only two options on the Republican ballot. Statewide, “uncommitted”
received 13% of the vote in the GOP primary. In Jefferson County,
however, “uncommitted” received 23%. </p>
<p>In the 4th Congressional District — which runs along the Ohio River,
sharing its northern boundary with Indiana and Ohio — the United
Democracy Project, a group that has criticized Massie for his record on
Israel, had spent $328,672 on the race as of last Tuesday. However,
those ads have not supported an alternative candidate. </p>
<p>The AP does not make projections and will declare a winner only when
it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing
candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will
continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate
concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make
clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why. </p>
<p>Kentucky mandates a recount if the top candidate wins by less than
0.5 percentage point. However, that recount rule does not apply to the
presidential race. Candidates can ask for a recanvass of the vote, which
entails retabulating the vote totals, if the margin is less than 1
percentage point. However, to request a recount, in which each ballot is
hand-counted, a court must approve and prescribe the procedure. </p>
<p>What do turnout and the advance vote look like? </p>
<p>As of March 31, there were 3,487,292 registered voters in Kentucky.
Of those voters, 43% were Democrats and 46% were Republicans.  </p>
<p>In 2022, 17% of voters cast their ballots before Election Day.  </p>
<p>How long does vote-counting usually take?</p>
<p>In the 2023 primary election, the AP first reported results at 6:03
p.m. Eastern time, or three minutes after the first polls closed. The
election night tabulation ended at 9:56 p.m. with about 98% of total
votes counted. </p>
<p>Are we there yet?</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, there will be 168 days until the November general
election.</p>

Prices Could Be Pretty Low This Summer — Except for One Thing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjI4NDMzMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0OTI3ODcxOH0.xEX5_EfLRpQJKgaWYpIYPnhUeoTL1YmJIyS-Zgj2TIw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The American oil refining business is a
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pnp_cap1_dcu_nus_a.htm" target="_blank">national
colossus</a>, with almost 130 facilities taking in some
<a href="https://ir.eia.gov/wpsr/wpsrsummary.pdf" target="_blank">16
million barrels of crude oil</a> per day and turning it into nearly
<a href="https://ir.eia.gov/wpsr/wpsrsummary.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">10
million barrels of gasoline and 5 million barrels of diesel</a>. And
unlike some past years, inventories are looking pretty good heading into
this summer. While they’re lower than the five-year average, gasoline
supplies are still higher than where they were a year ago, and
refineries are a ways away from running at their peak capacity.
According to the forecasters at GasBuddy, we’re looking at relatively
mild summertime prices of around $3.50 to $3.60 per gallon.
</p>
<p>
The one wild card: weather. About half of America’s refining capacity
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/special/gulf_of_mexico/" target="_blank">sits
on the Gulf Coast</a>, putting America’s fuel production squarely in the
target zone of what could be an
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-season-2024" target="_blank">especially
active hurricane season</a>.
</p>
<p>
“If you recall 2022, inventories were tight and [refinery] utilization
was tight,” explained Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy’s head of petroleum
analysis. Gas prices peaked in June of 2022 at slightly over $5 per
gallon, according to data the Energy Information Administration’s data,
after the Russian invasion of Ukraine sent crude oil prices soaring to
more $120 a barrel. “Our head is holding above water now,” he said,
because demand is low. “We’re in a much better position going into the
start of the summer compared to two years ago.”
</p>
<p>
Oil prices have largely stayed steady so far this year other than a
brief
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DCOILWTICO" target="_blank">spike</a>
in early April, despite continued attacks on
<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/9/yemens-houthis-say-they-attacked-ships-in-gulf-of-aden-indian-ocean" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shipping
by Houthi rebels in Yemen</a> and the ongoing threat of a spiraling
regional conflict in the Middle East. The top gas price last month was
around $3.67 a gallon, whereas GasBuddy’s range of possible prices for
the summer months average closer to $3.60. All things considered, De
Haan told me, “we got a little bit of breathing room.”
</p>
<p>
Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note to clients last week that
gasoline stockpiles “remain close to the 5-year average level and are
not drawing as strongly as usual for this time of year,” which puts
downward pressure on prices. U.S. demand is hovering below 9 million
barrels these days,
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=23&t=10" target="_blank">which
is right about the average demand in 2023</a>, indicating that some
consumer weakness may be responsible for relatively mild gas prices.
</p>
<p>
Weaker-than-expected demand for gasoline would be consistent with other
signs of the American consumer being slightly less spendy in recent
months.
<a href="https://www.census.gov/retail/sales.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Overall
retail sales in April</a> were basically flat from the month before,
according to Census Bureau data, and came in
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/us-retail-sales-stall-in-april-missing-expectations-6-new-bankruptcies-81691705" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lower
than economists’ expectations</a>. Sales at gasoline stations were down
0.8% in the first four months of this year compared to the first four
months of 2023, despite overall spending going up 3.5% from the same
period a year ago.
</p>
<p>
What can be good for drivers may not be so great for investors and the
gasoline complex at large. “It’s undeniable to say that there’s some
trouble in gasoline land,” Rory Johnston, a commodities analyst and
author of Commodity Context, told me. “In terms of whether it’s supply
or demand more broadly, as always, it’s a bit of both.”
</p>
<p>
Whatever the cause, it will mean
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-refiners-profits-fall-last-year-margins-remain-strong-2024-04-24/" target="_blank">less
profit for refiners</a>, especially compared to the record
outperformance they’ve seen in recent years.
</p>
<p>
“Gasoline prices and refining margins have come under pressure,” Reuters
reported last week, meaning that refineries are making a bit less than
before on the difference between crude oil and gasoline prices.
Inventories are also being run down more slowly than is normal for the
pre-summer season, the report said, “indicating supplies are plentiful,
and undermining the bullish case for the fuel.”
</p>
<p>
And yet if it’s destructive enough, just one hurricane could upend that
entire narrative. When Hurricane Harvey parked its torrential rains over
Houston in 2017, it took a
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/30/harvey-shuts-down-largest-us-oil-refinery-bears-down-on-louisiana-plants.html#:~:text=Tropical%20Storm%20Harvey%20has%20shuttered,area%20refiners%20were%20also%20closed." target="_blank">big
chunk of the U.S. refinery complex offline</a>, pushing gas prices up
$0.36 in just two weeks.<br/>
</p>
<p>
While the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has yet to
release its official hurricane forecast for the year, The Weather
Company has
<a href="https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2024-04-17-weather-company-hurricane-season-outlook-april" target="_blank">predicted</a>
that the 2024 season “could be one of the most active on record.” If
those hurricanes hit the wrong parts of the Gulf Coast, the expected
mild summer for America’s internal combustion-dependent drivers may be
blown away.

More Than 4 Days to Put Out This Battery Fire</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjI3OTc5OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MzcyODY1MX0.9ENyMXROYIWfmcEnsgvUZ8Z6SGhS2UiCsVwqdabf47I/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
A fire at a battery storage site in San Diego County appears to have
been extinguished after burning on and off for multiple days and nights.
</p>
<p>
“There is no visible smoke or active fire at the scene,” Cal Fire, the
state fire protection agency, said in an
<a href="https://x.com/CALFIRESANDIEGO/status/1792574698426896529" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>update
Monday morning</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
The fire started sometime Wednesday at the Gateway Energy Storage
facility, a 250 megawatt battery electric storage system in Otay Mesa,
which is immediately adjacent both to the eastern border of San Diego
and to the northern border of Mexico and near the Richard J. Donovan
state prison facility.
</p>
<p>
Firefighters first succeeded in putting out the blaze on Thursday, “but
a flare-up later that night brought firefighters back to the scene,” the
<a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/public-safety/story/2024-05-19/smoke-continues-to-rise-firefighters-assess-damaged-roof-at-otay-mesa-battery-storage-facility" target="_blank"><u><em>San
Diego Union-Tribune</em> reported</u></a>. Firefighters continued
working on the flames all weekend. As late as Sunday, there were 40
firefighters at the scene,

to <em>Union-Tribune</em> reporters</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Gateway’s owner and operator is LS Power, which has not responded to a
request for comment as of publication time. LS Power operates several
battery electric storage facilities in both California and New York.
<a href="https://www.lspower.com/ls-power-energizes-largest-battery-storage-project-in-the-world-the-250-mw-gateway-project-in-california-2/" target="_blank"><u>Gateway

battery storage projects in California</u></a>. Its purpose is to charge
when energy is cheap or when there’s plentiful solar power so that it
can deliver that excess energy back to the grid at times of high demand.
</p>
<p>
Fires have been a recurring problem for the battery electric storage
industry, which may be one reason why, according to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/battery-support-survey" target="_self"><u>Heatmap
polling</u></a>, it is the form of carbon-free power least popular with
the general public. Firefighters need
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/lithium-ion-battery-fires-storage" target="_self"><u>specific
training</u></a><span style="background-color: initial;"> to deal with
battery fires,</span> and
“<a href="https://nfsa.org/2023/01/12/lithium-ion-battery-fires/#:~:text=When%20they%20reach%20thermal%20runaway,a%20lithium%2Dion%20battery%20fire." target="_blank"><u>thermal
runaway</u></a>” — i.e. one cell overheating and igniting leading to
another cell doing so and so on — can mean that fires last for several
days at very high temperatures.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>On Saturday,
<a href="https://x.com/CALFIRESANDIEGO/status/1791896579630387572/photo/1" target="_blank"><u>Cal
Fire reported</u></a> that “lithium batteries continue to experience
thermal runaway,” and that the fire had “burned through part of the
roof.” As of now, fire personnel are “on standby in case additional
batteries undergo thermal runaway.”

<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CANNES, France — While Donald Trump’s hush money trial entered its
sixth week in New York, an origin story for the Republican presidential
candidate premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on Monday, unveiling a
scathing portrait of the former president in the 1980s. </p>
<p>“The Apprentice,” directed by the Iranian Danish filmmaker Ali
Abbasi, stars Sebastian Stan as Trump. The central relationship of the
movie is between Trump and Roy Cohn (Jeremy Strong), the defense
attorney who was chief counsel to Joseph McCarthy’s 1950s Senate
investigations. </p>
<p>Cohn is depicted as a longtime mentor to Trump, coaching him in the
ruthlessness of New York City politics and business. Early on, Cohn
aided the Trump Organization when it was being sued by the federal
government for racial discrimination in housing. </p>
<p>“The Apprentice,” which is labeled as inspired by true events,
portrays Trump’s dealings with Cohn as a Faustian bargain that guided
his rise as a businessman and, later, as a politician. Stan’s Trump is
initially a more naive real-estate striver, soon transformed by Cohn’s
education. </p>
<p>The film notably contains a scene depicting Trump raping his wife,
Ivana Trump (played by Maria Bakalova). In Ivana Trump’s 1990 divorce
deposition, she stated that Trump raped her. Trump denied the allegation
and Ivana Trump later said she didn’t mean it literally, but rather that
she had felt violated. </p>
<p>That scene and others make “The Apprentice” a potentially explosive
big-screen drama in the midst of the U.S. presidential election. The
film is for sale in Cannes, so it doesn’t yet have a release date. </p>
<p>Variety on Monday reported alleged behind-the-scenes drama
surrounding “The Apprentice.” Citing anonymous sources, the trade
publication reported that billionaire Dan Snyder, the former owner of
the Washington Commanders and an investor in “The Apprentice,” has
pressured the filmmakers to edit the film over its portrayal of Trump.
Snyder previously donated to Trump’s presidential campaign. </p>
<p>Neither representatives for the film nor Snyder could immediately be
reached for comment. </p>
<p>In the press notes for the film, Abbasi, whose previous film “Holy
Spider” depicts a female journalist investigating a serial killer in
Iran, said he didn’t set out to make “a History Channel episode.” </p>
<p>“This is not a biopic of Donald Trump,” said Abbasi. “We’re not
interested in every detail of his life going from A to Z. We’re
interested in telling a very specific story through his relationship
with Roy and Roy’s relationship with him.” </p>
<p>Regardless of its political impact, “The Apprentice” is likely to be
much discussed as a potential awards contender. The film, shot in a
gritty 1980’s aesthetic, returns Strong to a New York landscape of money
and power a year following the conclusion of HBO’s “Succession.” Strong,
who’s currently performing on Broadway in “An Enemy of the People,”
didn’t attend the Cannes premiere Monday. </p>
<p>“The Apprentice” is playing in competition in Cannes, making it
eligible for the festival’s top award, the Palme d’Or. At Cannes,
filmmakers and casts hold press conferences the day after a movie’s
premiere. “The Apprentice” press conference will be Tuesday.</p>

clicks dry up for news sites, could Apple News be a lifeline?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;known-bookmark&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;e-content&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
“The free version of Apple News is one of the biggest news platforms in
the world. It’s the most widely used news application in the United
States, the U.K., Canada, and Australia, and boasted over 125 million
monthly users in 2020.”
</p>
<p>
And publications are becoming dependent on it.
</p>
<p>
I agree strongly with the journalist’s view at the bottom of this piece:
</p>
<p>
“It incentivizes users to subscribe to Apple News+ rather than to
publications directly, likely cannibalizing some potential revenue. It’s
driving editorial decisions, meaning publishers are once again changing
their content strategy to placate a platform. And of course the company
could wake up one day and decide, like Facebook, that it no longer
really wants to be in the news business, leaving news publishers
stranded.”
</p>
<p>
Newsrooms - say it with me - need to establish direct, first-party
connections with their audiences. Anything else gives a third party too
much supplier power over their businesses and presents an existential
risk. Apple News is useful right now, but at its heart the dynamics that
drive it are no different to Facebook or Twitter. There’s nothing to say
it’s here for good, and there’s nothing smart about letting Apple own
your relationship with your readers.

<h2 id="the-indiewebs-next-stage">The IndieWeb’s next stage?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;known-bookmark&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;e-content&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
“I want the IndieWeb to be a viable alternative to social media,
gradually widening the audience beyond tech-savvy folks by making the
tools easier to use and more reliable.”
</p>
<p>
This is what we were trying for with Known: something that felt social
but was fully under the user’s control. We had installers at third-party
hosts; we had our own managed service; we had the open source code for
people who wanted to use that directly.
</p>
<p>
The fediverse adds a missing piece here: Known suffered immensely from a
blank page and no reader view when you logged in for the first time. Now
we can build platforms that immediately connect people to a much wider
social network that is outside of monolithic corporate control but also
makes it (relatively) easy to find the people you care about.
</p>
<p>
A combination between the fediverse and indieweb is almost inevitable.
This is what Ghost appears to be building today, for example, with its
new integrated fediverse reader tool. WordPress may also be headed in
that direction. And there will be many others.
</p>
<p>
A huge +1, also, to the idea that we can “manifest momentum by speaking
aloud your dreams and letting others share them with you”. This is how
community-building works.
</p>
<p>
And, for the record, I’m all-in.

Court rejects appeal from Canadian man once held at Guantanamo</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected an appeal by a
Canadian-born former Guantanamo detainee who was seeking to wipe away
his war crimes convictions, including for killing a U.S. soldier in
Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Omar Khadr had waived his right to appeal when he pleaded guilty in
2010 to charges that included murder. But his lawyers argued that a
subsequent ruling by the federal appeals court in Washington called into
question whether Khadr could have been charged with the crimes in the
first place.</p>
<p>A divided three-judge panel ruled that, despite the appellate ruling,
Khadr gave up his right to appeal.</p>
<p>Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Ketanji Brown Jackson did not take part
in the Supreme Court’s consideration of Khadr’s appeal because both had
dealt with the case while they served as appeals court judges. Jackson
explained her recusal from Monday’s order; Kavanaugh did not.</p>
<p>Khadr had been sentenced to eight years in prison plus the time he
already had spent in custody, including several years at the U.S. naval
base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. But he was released in May 2015 pending
his appeal of the guilty plea.</p>
<p>A Canadian judge ruled in 2019 that his war crimes sentence had
expired.</p>
<p>Khadr was 15 when he was captured by U.S. troops following a
firefight at a suspected al-Qaida compound in Afghanistan that resulted
in the death of an American special forces medic, U.S. Army Sgt. First
Class Christopher Speer. Khadr, who was suspected of throwing the
grenade that killed Speer, was taken to Guantanamo and ultimately
charged with war crimes by a military commission.</p>

id="ship-that-caused-deadly-baltimore-bridge-collapse-has-been-refloated-moving-back-to-port">Ship
that caused deadly Baltimore bridge collapse has been refloated, moving
back to port</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Baltimore — The container ship that caused the deadly collapse of
Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge was refloated at high tide Monday
and began slowly moving back to port, guided by several tugboats.</p>
<p>Removing the Dali from the wreckage marked a significant step in
ongoing cleanup and recovery efforts. Nearly two months have passed
since the ship lost power and crashed into one of the bridge’s
supporting columns, killing six construction workers and halting most
maritime traffic through Baltimore’s busy port.</p>
<p>The vessel appeared to start moving shortly after 6 a.m. It started
and stopped a few times before slowly and steadily backing away from the
collapse site, where it had been grounded since the March 26
disaster.</p>
<p>Pieces of the bridge’s steel trusses still protruded from its damaged
bow, which remained covered in mangled concrete from the collapsed
roadway.</p>
<p>With the hulking cargo ship finally removed from the mouth of
Baltimore’s harbor, a newly opened void appeared in the city’s skyline.
The altered waterscape also highlighted the progress made on the cleanup
effort; crews have already removed hundreds of tons of mangled steel
that once were visible jutting up from the water’s surface.</p>
<p>The bodies of all six construction workers have been recovered from
the underwater wreckage in recent weeks. All the victims were Latino
immigrants who came to the U.S. for job opportunities. They were filling
potholes on an overnight shift when the bridge was destroyed.</p>
<p>Officials said the Dali would move at about 1 mph on the roughly
2.5-mile (4-kilometer) trip back to port, a fraction of the speed it was
traveling when it lost power and brought down the bridge.</p>
<p>The ship is expected to remain in the port for a several weeks and
undergo temporary repairs before being moved to a shipyard for more
substantial repairs. It will return to the same marine terminal it
occupied before beginning its ill-fated voyage.</p>
<p>Crews began preparing the ship to be refloated about 18 hours before
it started moving Monday morning. That process included releasing
anchors and pumping out over 1 million gallons of water that were
keeping the ship grounded and stable during complex cleanup operations.
Crews conducted a controlled demolition on May 13 to break down the
largest remaining span of the collapsed bridge, which was draped across
the Dali’s bow.</p>
<p>Dive teams also completed inspections of the site to confirm there
were no obstructions that would hinder the voyage.</p>
<p>The Dali experienced two electrical blackouts about 10 hours before
leaving the Port of Baltimore on its way to Sri Lanka, according to a
preliminary report released last week by the National Transportation
Safety Board. In response to those issues, the crew made changes to the
ship’s electrical configuration, switching to a transformer and breaker
system that had previously been out of use for several months, the
report says.</p>
<p>The Dali experienced two more blackouts as it was approaching the Key
Bridge, causing it to lose propulsion and drift off course at the exact
wrong moment.</p>
<p>The two tugboats that helped guide the Dali out of the port had
peeled off after it entered the main shipping channel. That was normal
protocol, according to the report, but when the power went out, the tugs
were too far away to help avert disaster.</p>
<p>The FBI has also launched a criminal investigation into the
circumstances leading up to the crash.</p>
<p>The ship’s crew members haven’t been allowed to leave the vessel
since the disaster. Officials said they’ve been busy maintaining the
ship and assisting investigators. Of the crew members, 20 are from India
and one is Sri Lankan. Officials have said they will be able to
disembark once the Dali is docked in Baltimore.</p>
<p>Officials plan to reopen the port’s 50-foot (15-meter) deep draft
channel by the end of May. Until then, crews have established a
temporary channel that’s slightly shallower.</p>

on first state visit by Kenyan leader to US in two decades</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Nairobi — Kenyan President William Ruto meets his U.S. counterpart
Joe Biden in Washington this week, with the crisis in Haiti and efforts
to build trade ties likely to top the agenda.</p>
<p>Billed as “historic” by Ruto’s office, it is the first state visit by
a Kenyan president to the United States in two decades and the first by
an African leader since 2008.</p>
<p>Thursday’s Biden-Ruto talks will focus on trade and security
partnerships including Kenya’s pledge to lead a UN-backed multinational
mission seeking to restore order in Haiti, which has been wracked by
gang-fueled anarchy.</p>
<p>Kenya has offered to send 1,000 personnel, along with forces pledged
by several other countries, although the United States and other major
nations have ruled out putting their own forces on the ground.</p>
<p>A first batch of Kenyan police is expected to make the
12,000-kilometre (7,500-mile) journey to the Haitian capital
Port-au-Prince this week, security sources told AFP, despite a fresh
court challenge in Nairobi against the deployment.</p>
<p>Ruto has defended the undertaking as a “mission for humanity” in the
Western hemisphere’s poorest nation, which has suffered from poverty,
political instability and natural disasters for decades.</p>
<p>But a new lawsuit filed last week is seeking to hold Ruto’s
government in contempt for “blatantly” ignoring a January court order
prohibiting the deployment as unconstitutional and illegal.</p>
<p>Funding could also prove a stumbling block for the mission, analysts
say.</p>
<p>The United States is the largest backer of the force, pledging more
than $300 million since the Haiti crisis intensified several years ago
but other countries have been slow to offer support.</p>
<p>Ruto will demand “the U.S. do more to rally financial support for the
UN basket fund,” said Meron Elias, East and Southern Africa analyst at
the International Crisis Group.</p>
<p>“Kenya also wants the U.S. to commit greater backing to stemming the
flow of arms into Haiti, including from US ports in Florida,” she
said.</p>
<p>Trade deal</p>
<p>Ruto begins his visit on Monday in Atlanta, Georgia where he will
visit the Carter Presidential Library and Museum, among other
engagements.</p>
<p>“His remarks here will underline the importance of democracies
working collaboratively to tackle global challenges,” State House
spokesman Hussein Mohamed said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, he is due to visit studios owned by entertainment mogul
Tyler Perry, who has championed greater diversity in Hollywood to
“explore opportunities within the creative economy.”</p>
<p>Ruto will meet a Congressional delegation on Wednesday and call for
the extension of a free trade agreement — the African Growth and
Opportunity Act (AGOA) — which eliminates import tariffs on goods from
eligible African nations.</p>
<p>The pact expires in 2025, prompting African leaders to seek clarity
on future arrangements.</p>
<p>Most of Kenya’s imports are from China — also one of its biggest
bilateral creditors — and Washington has been keen to eat into Beijing’s
clout in the region.</p>
<p>The East African nation began talks with the United States on a free
trade agreement in 2020 but nothing has been signed.</p>
<p>In 2022, the United States exported goods worth $604 million to Kenya
while imports totaled $875 million, according to the Office of the US
Trade Representative.</p>
<p>Kenyan Trade Minister Rebecca Miano said there were “very big
opportunities” for investment in the country.</p>
<p>“We have prepared more than 30 bankable projects worth over $20.5
billion to interest American investors and the Kenyan diaspora,” she
told local media last week.</p>
<p>‘Extremely disappointed’</p>
<p>A request for Ruto to address a joint session of Congress fell
through after House Speaker Mike Johnson of the Republican Party
declined to extend an invitation.</p>
<p>Lawmakers from Biden’s Democratic Party last week accused Johnson of
disrespecting Africa, saying they were “extremely disappointed” by the
decision.</p>
<p>The last African leader to address Congress was Liberia’s Ellen
Johnson Sirleaf, the continent’s first female elected head of state, in
2006.</p>
<p>The visit “feels a bit like a fig leaf” for Africa, the Center for
Strategic and International Studies said, as it comes after Biden broke
a promise to visit Africa last year.</p>
<p>Kenyan historian Macharia Munene also cautioned that Nairobi’s future
relationship with Washington would hinge on the outcome of the November
US presidential election.</p>
<p>Ruto is currently “America’s blue-eyed boy” and is “hobnobbing” with
Biden, a situation that could change if Donald Trump wins the presidency
again, he said in an opinion piece for The Standard newspaper.</p>

<li>Hail damage is making insurers nervous
</h3>
<p>
Hail damage accounted for between 50% and 80% of the $64 billion in
insured storm costs worldwide last year, according to international
reinsurance firm Swiss Re. As storms become more frequent and more
severe due to climate change, insurers are beginning to factor hail into
their risk assessments on policies, <em>Bloomberg</em>

Such a move could result in higher rates for policyholders. Other
customers could lose insurance altogether. Some insurers are “nervous to
touch big solar farms” because of the incredible damage hail can do to
solar panels. One insurer has started testing the durability of various
panels by pummeling them with “industrially produced hail” and seeing
how well they hold up.

This is the first time in six years a U.S. firm has claimed the position
over Chinese rivals. Stock gains on Friday helped the company overtake
Sungrow Power Supply, which saw its shares fall at the same time. First
Solar is the biggest U.S. manufacturer of solar panels. While its
valuation is up, and U.S. solar firms will get a boost from higher
tariffs on Chinese clean tech goods, “by most other metrics, including
the vital one of being able to produce enough clean energy to fight
climate change, First Solar still has a way to go to catch up with its
Chinese counterparts,” <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em> said.

THE KICKER
</h2>
<p>
<em>“The chances of politicians acting swiftly are probably better than
they have been in the past. Not because of new scientific findings, but
because solar, wind, and batteries have become so cheap so fast that the
amount of pain involved in the transition to clean energy is far less
than it would have been a decade ago. We could actually do this.”</em>

<h2 id="kde-plasma-6-comes-to-openbsd">KDE Plasma 6 comes to
OpenBSD</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Last year marked a significant milestone for both myself and the
OpenBSD desktop community, as we successfully ported KDE Plasma 5 and
all dependencies to OpenBSD. With the release of OpenBSD 7.5 on April 5,
2024, KDE Plasma in version 5.27.10 has become a part of our lovely
operating system. This success is the result of years of development
work and commitment to achieving this goal. KDE launched version 6 of
its Plasma desktop environment on February 28, 2024, bringing numerous
updates and features as well as the major switch to Qt6. I am immensely
proud that the OpenBSD team has managed to prepare for this major update
so swiftly. All necessary components have been committed to our CVS
tree, and the packages will soon be available. ↫ Rafael Sadowski
Excellent news for OpenBSD users who don’t wish to be using GNOME, Xfce,
or one of the smaller build-it-yourself desktop environments. My
dual-Xeon workstation, which I switched over from Fedora KDE to OpenBSD,
runs Xfce, because I feel a smaller desktop environment is a more
natural fit for OpenBSD, but I’m very happy to know that I have KDE to
fall back on in case Xfce turns out not to be a good fit for me in the
long term. I’ll give the OpenBSD developers an other experts in that
community some more time to iron out any wrinkles, and then I’ll
probably give it a go to see just how well KDE will be integrated with
the OpenBSD base system.</p>

Server 2025 to ship with DTrace by default</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Windows Server 2025 comes equipped with dtrace as a native tool.
DTrace is a command-line utility that enables users to monitor and
troubleshoot their system’s performance in real-time. DTrace allows
users to dynamically instrument both the kernel and user-space code
without any need to modify the code itself. This versatile tool supports
a range of data collection and analysis techniques, such as
aggregations, histograms, and tracing of user-level events. To learn
more, see DTrace for command line help and DTrace on Windows for
additional capabilities. ↫ What’s new in Windows Server 2025 DTrace was
originally developed by Sun as part of Solaris, but eventually made its
way to other operating systems as Sun collapsed in on itself and Oracle
gave it the final push. DTrace is available for the various surviving
Solars-based operating systems, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, macOS, and QNX,
and Microsoft ported DTrace from FreeBSD to Windows back in 2018. With
Windows Server 2025, DTrace will be shipped out of the box.</p>

id="wikileaks-assange-can-appeal-us-extradition-on-freedom-of-speech-grounds-1">Wikileaks’
Assange can appeal US extradition on freedom of speech grounds</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>London — The United States government’s attempts to extradite
Wikileaks founder Julian Assange from Britain on charges of espionage
took another legal twist Monday, as a British court ruled he must be
given the right to a full appeal against the order on freedom of speech
grounds. </p>
<p>The hearing at London’s High Court on Monday was the last legal hope
for Wikileaks founder Julian Assange to halt his imminent extradition to
the United States.  </p>
<p>Two of the three judges ruled that a full appeal hearing must be held
into whether the 52-year-old Australian citizen would be able to rely on
the U.S. First Amendment right to free speech, in an American
court. </p>
<p>“This is good news because it means that the Julian Assange case can
now proceed to a hearing that will substantively consider the freedom of
expression arguments,” said Simon Crowther, a legal adviser at Amnesty
International.</p>
<p>Assange’s lawyers successfully argued that U.S. government assurances
that he could “seek to rely” on those First Amendment rights were
inadequate. A new appeal process could take months or years. </p>
<p>Barry Pollack, a member of Assange’s legal team, described the ruling
as a significant milestone. “The High Court is going to hear the vitally
important issues of whether someone should be extradited to the United
States for having published truthful, newsworthy information.” </p>
<p>“The United States should never have brought this case. It is utterly
inconsistent with First Amendment values and all that the United States
says that it believes. And I hope the United States will take a hard
look at this decision and maybe reconsider whether they want [to] pursue
this fundamentally flawed case,” Pollack said at a news conference
following the ruling Monday. </p>
<p>Assange was not in court Monday due to ill health. His wife, Stella
Assange, said it was the correct ruling.</p>
<p>“As a family, we are relieved. But how long can this go on? The
United States should read the situation and drop this case now. Now is
the moment to do it. Just abandon this shameful attack on journalists,
on the press and the public that has been going on for 14 years. This
case is shameful, and it is taking an enormous toll on Julian. He is
under enormous pressure. He has been in Belmarsh Prison for over five
years,” she told hundreds of supporters outside the court. </p>
<p>U.S. prosecutors have filed 18 charges against Assange, relating to
allegations of hacking and theft of classified material. They did not
immediately comment on Monday’s court ruling. </p>
<p>In 2010, WikiLeaks published thousands of stolen diplomatic cables
relating to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, which Assange said exposed
abuses by the United States military. The U.S. government argues his
actions went beyond journalism by soliciting, stealing and
indiscriminately publishing classified government documents that
endangered innocent lives. </p>
<p>The case sets a vital precedent, said Amnesty’s Simon Crowther. “What
Julian Assange is being prosecuted for is something journalists do all
the time: they receive classified material that exposes war crimes or
alleged war crimes, or crimes against humanity, serious human rights
violations. And when it’s in the public interest, they publish those
documents,” Crowther told VOA. </p>
<p>Assange has spent the past five years in London’s Belmarsh high
security jail.  </p>
<p>Prior to that, he sought refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London
for seven years after Swedish prosecutors charged him with two counts of
rape, which he denied. The charges were later dropped. Assange was
jailed for breaching his bail conditions. The U.S. Justice Department
first formally requested his extradition in 2019. </p>
<p>In the coming months, Assange will have the right to bring a new
appeal before the British courts, where he will argue that the U.S.
judicial system would deny him his right to free speech.</p>

<p>Delivering the commencement address to the graduating seniors at
Morehouse College today, President Joe Biden addressed the nation. After
thanking the mothers, fathers, grandmothers, grandfathers, and all the
people who helped the graduates get to the chairs in front of the stage,
Biden recalled Morehouse’s history. The school was founded in 1867 by
civil rights leader Reverend William Jefferson White with the help of
two other Baptist ministers, the Reverend Richard C. Coulter and the
Reverend Edmund Turney, to educate formerly enslaved men. They believed
“education would be the great equalizer from slavery to freedom,” Biden
said, and they created an institution that would make the term
“Morehouse man” continue to stand as a symbol of excellence 157 years
later.</p>

<h2 id="hurt-in-mass-shooting-in-savannah-georgia">11 hurt in mass
shooting in Savannah, Georgia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAVANNAH, Ga. — An argument between two women led to a gunfight that
left 11 people hurt in a busy tourist area of Savannah, Georgia, late
Saturday, one of five weekend shootings in the city, two of which were
fatal, authorities said.</p>
<p>Two people were injured in separate shootings Friday. Two more
shootings Saturday resulted in two deaths. Then came the gunfire just
before midnight Saturday near Savannah’s Ellis Square.</p>
<p>The shooting broke out as two women argued in an area business,
according to Police Chief Lenny Gunther, who didn’t name the
establishment.</p>
<p>“One shot rang out. That triggered other individuals to shoot,” he
said. “We had multiple individuals discharge their weapons to shoot at
each other, which resulted in multiple people getting shot.”</p>
<p>Ten of the 11 injured were hit by gunfire. Authorities did not say
what caused the 11th injury. Victims were treated at the scene and
“several” were taken to a hospital, police said. None of the injuries
appeared life threatening.</p>
<p>Mayor Van Johnson said a proliferation of guns was a factor in the
shootings and that reasonable gun control laws are needed. He also
stressed the need for gun owners to keep their weapons from being stolen
and for people carrying guns to know how and when to use them.</p>
<p>“We have to insist on smart gun laws,” Johnson said at a Sunday news
conference. “And then, on the other end, we have to insist that people
act responsibly with those weapons.”</p>
<p>The mass shooting happened a week ahead of the tourist-heavy Memorial
Day weekend. Gunther sought to assure people that police staffing will
be sufficient to keep the public safe.</p>
<p>Ellis Square is in Savannah’s historic district, an area popular
among tourists and locals. It was developed in 2010 and is known for a
large fountain and a life-sized statue of songwriter Johnny Mercer.</p>
<p>The first two of Savannah’s weekend shootings happened Friday. Each
of those resulted in a non-life-threatening injury and an arrest. On
Saturday, police answering a call about a home invasion found a dead
juvenile at the home. Initial reports are that shots were fired after a
resident confronted an armed intruder.</p>
<p>Still another shooting was reported at a Savannah intersection
Saturday night that left one man dead and a juvenile injured.</p>

<p>Almost half a million Ukrainian immigrants have moved to the U.S.
since the start of Russia’s invasion, according to the Department of
Homeland Security. Two of the biggest challenges they face are finding
health care and a job. In one small Colorado city, a local clinic owner,
herself a Ukrainian immigrant, is helping out as much as she can.
Svitlana Prystinska has the story, narrated by Anna Rice.</p>

<h2 id="pg_dumpbinary-v2.17-released">pg_dumpbinary v2.17 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
<strong>Grenoble, France - Mai 20, 2024</strong>
</p>
<h2>
pg_dumpbinary
</h2>
<p>
<code>pg_dumpbinary</code> dumps a PostgreSQL database to a binary
format. The resulting dump must be restored using
<code>pg_restorebinary</code>, which is provided.
</p>
<p>
This release adds two new options to command pg_restorebinary:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Add option <code>-C, –create</code> to pg_restorebinary to create the
database before restoring into it. Like with pg_restore you must provide
a database to connect using the <code>-d</code> option.
</li>
<li>
Add <code>–dump-create</code> to print to stdout the create and alter
database statements.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<code>pg_dumpbinary</code> is useful when:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You have bytea that can not be exported by <code>pg_dump</code> because
the total size of the escape/hex output exceeds 1Gb.
</li>
<li>
You have custom type that stores <code>\0</code> internally in bytea but
data are exported by pg_dump as char/varchar/text. In this case pg_dump
truncates all data after the first <code>\0</code>, resulting in data
loss.
</li>
<li>
Other cases where a binary output format is useful.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In these kinds of cases <code>pg_dumpbinary</code> helps by dumping the
PostgreSQL database in a binary format. In all other cases the
pg_dump/pg_restore commands distributed with PostgreSQL are preferred.
</p>
<p>
See the documentation for a more complete description of available
features.
