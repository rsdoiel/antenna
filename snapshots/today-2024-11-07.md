## Swift Format in Xcode 16

date: 2024-11-06, from: Michael Tsai

Sarah Reichelt (Mastodon): In Xcode 16, Apple quietly introduced the ability to format your Swift files using Swift Format. I&#8217;m a long-time user of SwiftLint, but having such a tool built into Xcode would be a great convenience, so I decided to give it a try. Here is my description of why I use such [&#8230;]

## Data Tracking and Notifications in Core Data and SwiftData

date: 2024-11-06, from: Michael Tsai

Fatbobman (Mastodon): [prepareForDeletion is called] when the managed object is about to be deleted, typically used for cleaning up resources or manually managing relationships. Note that this method is triggered before validateForDelete. If the deletion operation fails due to validation failure, changes made in this method may be rolled back.[&#8230;]However, because these operations are extensions [&#8230;]

## Swift Proposal: Integer Generic Parameters

date: 2024-11-06, from: Michael Tsai

SE-0452 (via Steve Canon): Swift does not currently support fixed-size or fixed-capacity collections with inline storage. (Or at least, it doesn&#8217;t do so well, not without forming a struct with some specific number of elements and doing horrible things with withUnsafePointer to handle indexing.) Most of the implementation of something like a fixed-size array, or [&#8230;]

## Hypertextual Writing and Social Media

date: 2024-11-06, from: Michael Tsai

John Gruber (Mastodon): It also brought to mind how social media has largely kneecapped true hypertextual writing by not enabling it. You can, of course, add links to web pages in social media posts on any of the various basically-the-same-concept-as-Twitter platforms like X, Threads, Bluesky, or Mastodon, but you do so by pasting raw URLs [&#8230;]

## Lilbits: EU probes Corning Gorilla Glass for antitrust violations, Android TV and Google TV hardware requirement updates, and Mozilla Foundation layoffs

## Freedom of Choice vs. Oppression of Big Tech

date: 2024-11-06, from: Purism News and Events

<p>The modern smartphone landscape is dominated by a handful of technology giants, whose influence extends far beyond their own ecosystems. Unlike in the heyday of the PC revolution where multiple companies fought tooth and nail for market share by differentiating on feature functionality as well as price – offering a plethora of alternatives – today’s smartphone landscape is dominated by two main players: Apple’s IOS and Google’s Android.</p>

## Voted in America? This Site Doxed You

date: 2024-11-06, from: 404 Media Group

Voting rolls are technically public records but can be laborious to get hold of. A right-wing site weaponizes that information by allowing anyone, anywhere, to search for a voter’s physical address and party affiliation.

Roughly half of the world are of above-average gullibility. More than half of the world are on social media. Sometimes these combine in unfortunate ways.
