## Will Climate Get a SOTU Shout Out?

date: 2024-03-07, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDM0MDAwMC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODQzODE2Nn0.7qLtGHwtvJDuHPOt-W4Ue-pqu3d_1ggV3S7sxzg1utg/image.png?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C1%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p>
<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> Red flag fire warnings are in place across West Texas • Heavy rainfall caused extreme flooding in parts of West Java • Tourists in Morocco are disappointed to find the country’s public baths have been <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=ca3d3b1963&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">closed</a> three days a week due to severe drought.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>
1. Biden urged to highlight climate wins in SOTU 
</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Happy State of the Union day! President Biden will address Congress this evening, just as election season gets going in earnest, and some in his party are urging him to use the opportunity to make a Very Big Deal of his progress in the clean energy transition, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e2e035a5b9&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> <em>E&E News</em>. “We have a great story to tell,” Environment and Public Works Chair Tom Carper (D-Del.) said. “He has to tell it. We have to tell it. Eventually it will break through.” Some recent polls suggest that most Americans aren’t aware of Biden’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, and may consider Biden’s likely rival, former President Donald Trump, to be best positioned on issues like energy and economy. “Climate voters could make or break Joe Biden in 2024,” Nathaniel Stinnett, executive director of the nonprofit Environmental Voter Project, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=f9f392d286&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a><em> The New York Times</em>. The Natural Resources Defense Council <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=bbd761700e&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> the speech is “a chance for Biden to rally the nation around the climate progress of the past three years and show the way to build on those gains going forward.” Will he make the most of it? TBD.
</p><h3>
2. New SEC climate disclosure rules blasted as both too harsh and too weak
</h3><p>
	As expected, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved a rule yesterday that will require companies to disclose information about their climate-related risks to investors. But the final rule differs dramatically from the proposal the Commission released two years ago, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=65c1db1285&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained <em>Heatmap</em>’s Emily Pontecorvo</a>, with significantly weaker provisions that leave it up to companies to decide how much information to share. Most of the climate-related disclosures the rule covers are now mandatory only if they’re considered “material.” Further, only about 40% of domestic public companies will even be required to consider whether their emissions are material. Smaller companies and emerging growth businesses — generally companies with less than $1.2 billion in annual revenues — are exempt.
</p><p>
Though the final rules are weaker than the original draft, they’re still too stringent for some. At least 10 Republican-led states are 
	<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=dd9eea2628&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">suing the SEC</a>, accusing the Biden administration of playing “puppeteer” in using states to further a climate agenda. Meanwhile the Sierra Club environmental group might sue the SEC because it thinks the rules aren’t strict enough. An SEC spokesperson said the agency will “vigorously defend” the rules in court.
</p><p>
	Also yesterday, 25 states, along with industry groups, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=9eccac396b&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">filed three lawsuits</a> against the Environmental Protection Agency for its recent crackdown on soot pollution.<br/>
</p><h3>3. February warmth breaks records </h3><p>
<strong></strong>Last month was the warmest February ever recorded, the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=3594b2cdfb&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">said</a> today. This marks the 9th record-breaking month in a row, and the effects were felt world wide. Temperatures in Europe, for example, were 5.9 degrees Fahrenheit above averages seen between 1991 and 2020. But even more startling was the <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=270645e58f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ocean temperature</a>, which was higher last month than it was last August.

	“Sea surface temperatures are at record levels over regions far away from the centre of the El Niño action, such as the tropical Atlantic and Indian Ocean,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=78874e029d&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> climate scientist Richard Allan of the University of Reading, suggesting climate change was playing a big part in heating the ocean heat.
</p><h3>4. Strong global gusts could set new wind-power records</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Wind speeds in China, Europe, and the U.S. are expected to hit seasonal peaks in the coming weeks, which could result in record wind-power output, <em>Reuters</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0e9ca9b756&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">reported</a>. In both the U.S. and China, last year’s spring wind power hit new highs in terms of share of total electricity generation. In the months since, both countries have added more wind generation capacity, which means new records are likely. Wind’s share of global electricity generation peaked at 9.59% in November of last year, and could jump beyond 10% “easily” in 2024, <em>Reuters</em> said.

The report looked at 75 of the largest retailers, including Target, Walmart, Trader Joe’s, and 7-Eleven and found that charging is available on average at 1 out of every 14 big box store locations, 1 out of every 15 grocery stores, and 1 out of every 40 department stores. “These results show that there is no retail category where a driver can be confident that an EV charger will be available,” the report concludes. This is despite the fact that installing EV chargers has been shown to increase both foot traffic and revenue for retail shops. Here’s a look at how charging availability breaks down by big box brands:

## ElevenLabs Block on Cloning Biden's Voice Easily Bypassed

## WANDERLUST

date: 2024-03-07, from: Howard Jacobson blog

He saw her first - no he didn&#8217;t: he beheld her first - in the library of St Ursula&#8217;s College, a grammar school in North Manchester which had agreed to let him research its holdings of once venerated textbooks. Her head appeared above the stacks like that of a browsing giraffe. She even swivelled her jaw as though chewing on an acacia leaf. That was a tic he would come to hate &#8211; as for example when it accompanied a confession that she loved another man, or another woman, or both - but at first it beguiled him. It suggested the absent-mindedness of a person who was always somewhere else. She caught his gaze and smiled at him.

Also does he feel it's fair for a prosecutor to use his public platform to smear the rep of an innocent person?

## Guestbooks are cool

date: 2024-03-07, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>As I mentioned in a previous post, this site now has a <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/guestbook">guestbook</a>. But, as someone pointed out, I didn’t explain what the heck a guestbook is. I thought it was pretty self-explanatory but I think it’s worth writing a post about it anyway. On the <a href="https://indieweb.org/guestbook">IndieWeb website</a>, guestbooks are defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a way to allow visitors to your site to leave a comment about the website as a whole, instead of a comment about a specific post.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it’s a good definition. Guestbooks are a relic of a different time, back when the web wasn’t dominated by social media and interactions among people moved at a different pace. A guestbook is like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_register">summit book</a>, in a way. It’s something you can use to leave a trace of your presence.</p>
<p>But what do you write on the guestbook? Whatever you want. You can let me know how you landed here, you can use it to suggest a topic, or you can use it to just say hi. Just be kind and respectful.</p>
<p>I first toyed with the idea of adding a guestbook almost a year ago, after stumbling on <a href="https://sarajoy.dev/guestbook/">Sara Joy’s website</a>. I don’t remember how or why I was there but I loved the guestbook and it took me almost a year to finally code mine.</p>
<p>And I’m happy to see that <a href="https://kevquirk.com/i-have-a-guestbook">Kev</a> now has one on his site as well! If you decide to add a guestbook to your site send me an email, and I’ll be happy to come sign it.</p>                <hr>

## Women’s shifting roles in the Irish economy

date: 2024-03-07, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> On Friday, Ireland votes on whether to change a clause in the constitution that says a woman’s main duties are as a caregiver in the home.

## China Criticizes US for Suppressing Its Rise While Touting Partnership With Russia

date: 2024-03-07, from: VOA News USA

TAIPEI, TAIWAN    — Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi Thursday criticized the United States for trying to suppress China’s rise through sanctions and reiterated Beijing’s commitment to uphold the multipolar world order with partners such as Russia.


Speaking to local and foreign media during the annual meeting of China’s rubber-stamp parliament, Wang said while relations between China and the United States have improved since the summit between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping in November, Washington’s misconception of China remains strong and it has not honored the promises made during the summit.


“The U.S. continues to renew their means of suppressing China while expanding the sanctions list,” he said, adding that Washington’s desire to punish Beijing has reached an “unimaginable level.”


Questioning Washington’s credibility as a great power, Wang urged the U.S. to view China’s rise and development objectively and rationally handle its interactions with Beijing.


“We urge the U.S. to recognize the general trend of historical development and put its promises into practice,” Wang added.




Some analysts say Wang’s criticism of the U.S. reflects Beijing’s concern about facing technological bottlenecks and economic encirclement by Washington and its allies.


“Beijing is hoping to elicit further American concessions and it’s asking the U.S. to lower its walls on technological de-risking from China,” Wen-ti Sung, a political scientist at Australian National University told VOA in a written response.


While Wang urged the U.S. to promote a healthy and stable development of bilateral relations alongside China, he touted Beijing’s close partnership with Russia, saying both countries continue to deepen political mutual trust while pursuing mutually beneficial cooperation.


“As major world powers and permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, China, and Russia have forged a new paradigm of great power relations that adheres to permanent good neighborliness while deepening comprehensive strategic cooperation on the basis of nonalignment, nonconfrontation and nontargeting of third parties,” Wang said.


Some experts say China’s efforts to double down on its “no limits partnership” with Russia is mainly due to its attempt to build an alliance that can resist pressure imposed by the United States.


“Since Russia is anti-U.S., China needs an ally to help it resist pressure from Washington,” Liu Dongshu, an expert on Chinese politics at the City University of Hong Kong, told VOA by phone.


Since China has been highlighting the importance of its partnership with Russia before the Ukraine war, Liu said China may feel the need to stick with that commitment.


“It’s difficult for Beijing to admit that it’s made a mistake in being too supportive of Russia, so for the sake of saving its face, China needs to insist that it’s not wrong for maintaining the partnership with Russia,” he added.


As the war in Ukraine and the Middle East continue, Wang, a 70-year-old veteran diplomat who returned to the role of foreign minister last year following the mysterious dismissal of former Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang, said China is actively putting forward proposals for resolving regional and global issues.


He said the only way to end the vicious cycle extended from the conflict between Israel and Hamas is to “comprehensively implement the two-state solution” and said Beijing supports establishment of a Palestinian U.N. member state.


On the Ukraine war, Wang said China has always “maintained an objective and impartial position” and reiterated Beijing’s support for convening an international peace conference that is recognized by both Russia and Ukraine.


Liu in Hong Kong said China is facing a dilemma where it wants to present itself as a responsible great power internationally, but it doesn’t want to take action to address the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine.


“Unlike the U.S., which has experience in mediating global conflicts, China has long adopted this nonintervention approach,” he told VOA. “China is unwilling to take actions to get involved in these conflicts and it also may not be capable of doing that.”


Amid rising tension across the Taiwan Strait in recent weeks, with Chinese coast guard vessels increasing efforts to patrol disputed waters near Taiwan’s outlying islands, Wang said Beijing will never allow Taiwan to be separated “from the motherland” and warned countries around the world not to support Taiwan’s potential pursuit of independence.


“Whoever engages in ‘Taiwan independence’ on the island will be held accountable by history and whoever in the world supports ‘Taiwan independence’ will get burned for playing with fire and taste the bitter fruit of their own doing,” he warned during the 90-minute press conference.


Sung from Australian National University said Wang’s comments on Taiwan are intended to intensify pressure on Taiwan’s diplomatic partners and ensure Taiwan remains internationally isolated. Wang is trying to “warn other countries about the consequences of offering support for Taiwan while reiterating Beijing’s ultimate goal of achieving unification,” he told VOA.


As tension between China and the Philippines grows because of repeated confrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels in the disputed South China Sea, Wang said China has always exercised “a high degree of restraint” when handling maritime disputes.


“China has always respected historical and legal facts and sought a solution that’s acceptable to each party,” he said, adding that Beijing will not allow its “good intentions” to be abused or the law in the sea to be “distorted.”




After Wang set the tone for China’s foreign policy in 2024 through the press conference on Thursday, some analysts think Beijing will likely adopt a multiprong approach to manage its relationship with different countries.


“China will focus on managing ties with Europe, maintaining close relations with Russia and other pariah states, heightening tensions with Taiwan, India and in the South China Sea, cautiously testing the waters with the U.S. while seeking to court the Global South,” Sana Hashmi, a postdoctoral a fellow at the Taiwan-Asia Exchange Foundation, told VOA in a written response.

## March 6, 2024 

date: 2024-03-07, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

Black Americans outnumbered white Americans among the 29,500 people who lived in Selma, Alabama, in the 1960s, but the city&#8217;s voting rolls were 99% white. So, in 1963, Black organizers in the Dallas County Voters League launched a drive to get Black voters in Selma registered. The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, a prominent civil rights organization, joined them.

## Biden to Address Nation as Two Wars Rage Abroad

date: 2024-03-07, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The State of the Union address is traditionally the venue where American presidents highlight domestic successes, and President Joe Biden is expected to discuss his handling of the economy, reproductive rights, gun control, and immigration Thursday evening.


But as the United States deals with wars in the Middle East and Europe, foreign policy may be higher on the agenda in Biden’s fourth, and potentially final, such speech to a joint session of Congress.


The president intends to highlight his achievements in “restoring American leadership on the world stage,” John Kirby, White House national security communications adviser, told VOA during an interview on Wednesday.


American leadership, he added, gives it the ability to influence actions of world leaders and adversaries “in ways that are more in keeping with our national security interests.”




That influence has failed to overcome stark differences between Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on issues including how to deliver more humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza, the postwar role of the Palestinian Authority and the U.S. vision for a future Palestinian state.


On Ukraine, American leadership is overshadowed by House Republicans’ obstruction of a Senate-approved $95 billion foreign aid package that includes $61 billion to support Kyiv in its fight against Russia. The bill also includes $14 billion in security assistance for Israel, $9 billion in humanitarian assistance and $5 billion to support partners in the Indo-Pacific, as Washington competes against Beijing for regional influence.


The wars in Ukraine and Gaza will be prominently featured in the foreign policy portion of Biden’s speech, as will the U.S. strategic rivalry with China. Analysts say the president will employ different approaches on the two issues as he considers voters’ sentiments ahead of his bid for reelection in November.


Push for Ukraine aid


Biden will use his address to again call for the passage of the foreign aid bill and argue that it is not in America’s interest to embrace isolationism amid signs of growing Russian expansionism.


“The president is going to continue to make his case that House Republicans need to move forward. The speaker needs to put the national security supplemental on the floor,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during her briefing Wednesday. “We know that it would get overwhelming support.”


While the Biden administration has gathered international support for an effort that includes substantial military and economic aid to Ukraine, major sanctions on Russia and greatly increasing NATO’s military posture in eastern Europe, it has failed to provide a strong case for this policy for the American people, said John Herbst, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine who is now senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center.


“This in turn has made it easier for naïve voices, especially in the one corner of the Republican Party to block the assistance Ukraine needs to avoid a defeat,” Herbst told VOA.


Vanderbilt University presidential historian Thomas Schwartz predicted Biden “will go all in” on Ukraine, particularly in light of the recent death of Alexey Navalny in a Siberian prison. The Russian dissident’s death has intensified U.S. views that supporting Ukraine’s efforts to push back against Russian President Vladimir Putin is “a real moral cause,” Schwartz told VOA.


“This will also allow him to draw a sharp contrast with Trump, who has, of course, expressed admiration for Putin in the past and has not been as supportive on the Ukraine issue,” Schwartz added.


Polls show that Americans’ support for sending military aid to Kyiv is fractured along party lines, with voters of the president’s party largely sympathetic to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s war efforts.


According to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, 67% of Democrats see it as a priority for the U.S. government to prevent Russia from gaining more territory in Ukraine and to help Ukraine regain territory that is currently occupied by Russia. Only 37% of Republicans agree.


Biden will use his address to rally support amid Americans’ war fatigue. Overall, 37% of respondents — 55% of Republicans and 17% of Democrats — say the U.S. government is spending too much on aid to Ukraine.




Tread carefully on Gaza


The president is likely to tout his immediate support for Israelis following Hamas’ October 7 attack and underscore the importance of ensuring that Israel can defend itself against the U.S.-designated terror group’s threats.


But he will need to tread carefully on the issue, taking into account the division between pro-Israel Democrats and independents who support his stance on the conflict and progressive Democrats, as well as Arab and Muslim Americans, who are angered by it.


Outrage over the more than 30,000 people killed in Gaza and Biden’s refusal to put conditions on U.S. military aid for Israel has resulted in significant portions of Democratic primary election voters in Michigan and Minnesota marking their ballots “uncommitted” to signal their protest and demand an immediate and permanent cease-fire.


Negotiators have not yet been able to bring the fighting in Gaza to a halt ahead of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which begins this weekend. On Tuesday, Biden said the fate of the temporary cease-fire deal is in the “hands of Hamas” after Israel agreed to a “rational offer” that had been put on the table.


Hamas has since responded saying there can be no hostage exchange without a permanent cease-fire and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The group accused Israel of stalling the talks.


Israeli politicians will be carefully watching Thursday to see who Biden blames for the deadlock and how critical he is of Israeli efforts to protect and deliver aid to Palestinian civilians, said Jonathan Rynhold, head of the Department of Political Studies at Israel’s Bar-Ilan University.


As Biden is likely to reiterate his call for a two-state solution, Israelis will be anxious to see whether he calls on Israel to “present a clear vision that includes a Palestinian state,” Rynhold told VOA. “I doubt he'll do it, but if he does, it's bad for Netanyahu but not bad for the war.”




Biden is likely to focus his criticisms on the far-right elements within the Israeli government and signal displeasure at violence committed by what he calls “extreme settlers” in the West Bank, as he has done several times in the past.


Kirby said the president will also call for increasing humanitarian aid for Palestinians. With the Netanyahu government’s refusal to open more land crossings for aid convoys and the death of more than 100 people after Israeli troops opened fire as desperate Palestinians mobbed a convoy of food trucks, the U.S. has resorted to using military aircraft to drop supplies — a more expensive, inefficient and dangerous means to deliver aid.


A Gallup poll released this week shows 58% of Americans hold a favorable view of Israel, down from 68% last year, and the lowest favorable rating for the country in over two decades.


Iuliia Iarmolenko contributed to this report.

## How to Have Sex (2023)

date: 2024-03-07, from: Jessica Smith's blog

<p>Last August, Vivian took me to see the film <cite>How to Have Sex</cite>, which was screening at the Astor as part of the <abbr title="Melbourne International Film Festival">MIFF</abbr>. What Viv did <em>not</em> warn me of adequately before we saw the film was that it&rsquo;s about an eighteen-year-old girl who gets much too drunk and loses her virginity in a sexual encounter that was fundamentally not consensual but also difficult to describe as &ldquo;rape&rdquo;, and as someone who basically <em>was</em> that eighteen-year-old girl a long time ago I&rsquo;d <em>really</em> have appreciated more of a heads-up about that. Watching the film dredged up a <em>lot</em> of long-buried bitterness in me, and truth be told, all these months later I still haven&rsquo;t successfully buried it again. I have been told, of course, that &ldquo;burying trauma isn&rsquo;t the same as dealing with trauma,&rdquo; which honestly I would like to call bullshit on because when my trauma was buried, I felt fine, and now it&rsquo;s been resurrected, I don&rsquo;t, and on the surface that seems to me like a regression.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> To be fair, I don&rsquo;t think Viv looked that deeply into the movie; I think he saw &ldquo;eighteen-year-olds having sex on holiday&rdquo; and went, &ldquo;Sounds amazing, sign me up.&rdquo; Anyway, what&rsquo;s done is done.  Apparently, the film&rsquo;s just entered general release here (<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-06/how-to-have-sex-molly-manning-walker-cannes/103481472" title="ABC News: Molly Manning Walker&#39;s feature debut How to Have Sex explores consent and sex through the eyes of teens">see ABC article<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;<svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>(external link)</title><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></span></a>), so I thought I&rsquo;d dust off this long-stalled draft and try to polish it up.</p>
<p>The filmmaker herself, Molly Manning Walker, was actually in attendance on that night in August, and there was a Q&amp;A with her after the screening. That was really good in and of itself, and I&rsquo;m glad we stayed for it. She described her film as (along these lines) &ldquo;a very personal story, and one that a lot of people relate to,&rdquo; and made the excellent point that our conversations about consent need to be more nuanced, which I agree with wholeheartedly. She said that &ldquo;the law, which doesn&rsquo;t protect us anyway&rdquo; has its own legal standard for what sexual assault is, but it&rsquo;s such a high bar to clear, and it doesn&rsquo;t mean that everything that falls short of that bar is A-OK and acceptable. So, she said, &ldquo;since the law doesn&rsquo;t protect us anyway,&rdquo; we should move to using our own definitions and having our own conversations about consent, which should be human-focused and centre &ldquo;people just having a good time&rdquo;. People shouldn&rsquo;t just think to themselves, &ldquo;Is this <em>literally rape?</em>&rdquo; but, &ldquo;How can I make sure this other person has a good experience?&rdquo; This is a much more important question.</p>
<p>Another thing she talked about is the need to reach out to people (and <abbr title="Let's Be Real">LBR</abbr>, mostly men) who are currently engaging in these kinds of coercive, pushy, or not-entirely-consensual sexual practices, and how you&rsquo;ll never actually reach them – you&rsquo;ll repel them and they won&rsquo;t listen – if you brand them &ldquo;rapists&rdquo; or &ldquo;evil scum&rdquo; or whatever. (Even though, I&rsquo;ll admit, I&rsquo;ve succumbed to this temptation myself.) She talked about a meeting she went to with French film distributors who were considering screening this film, and said that one of the men had watched the film and come to the realisation that: &ldquo;I am Paddy.&rdquo; (Paddy being the pushy, manipulative dickhead in the film. And yes, OF COURSE it would be a Frenchman in her anecdote, of course.) She said that while on one level it&rsquo;s obviously shit that he has been a Paddy, it&rsquo;s good that he&rsquo;s been able to come to that realisation and one can only hope that he won&rsquo;t be a Paddy in the future. My experience with my own &ldquo;Paddy&rdquo; leads me to believe it&rsquo;s not <em>nearly</em> as simple as that, but generally speaking I think it&rsquo;s true: there needs to be a &ldquo;way back&rdquo; for people who have been insensitive or, you know, coercive, or sexually cruel, or whatever you could say. There&rsquo;s a huge stigma around &ldquo;being a rapist&rdquo;, for good reason obviously and it&rsquo;s clearly better than society being OK with rapists, but it&rsquo;s just so profoundly unhelpful to have this binary where behaviour is either &ldquo;rape&rdquo; <em>or</em> it&rsquo;s completely fine, or where men are either &ldquo;rapists&rdquo; – forever – <em>or</em> totally innocent. There has to be a way to say, &ldquo;What you did was unacceptable, but you can learn from it; it doesn&rsquo;t have to define you forever.&rdquo; Assuming he actually wants to learn, of course, but convincing such men to want to learn was one of Manning Walker&rsquo;s goals with the film.</p>
<p>In the critical scene of <cite>How to Have Sex</cite>, the protagonist – Tara – gets separated from her friends during a night&rsquo;s partying and winds up alone on a beach with Paddy, who gets increasingly physical and pushy before pressuring her to have sex with him. Very drunk, and vulnerable, she agrees, but her body language makes it clear it&rsquo;s really not what she wants. As the ABC article quotes her saying, Manning Walker finds it interesting the split reactions she gets about what actually happened in that scene:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lots of women would come into the room and say &rsquo;thank you for making this film, I&rsquo;ve been through that, I feel seen&rsquo;, and a lot of men would come in quite defensive and say, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not an assault because she said yes&rsquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I may not have got to tell her so personally, but I absolutely would&rsquo;ve been among those women. Because that really is the critical point&hellip; in the moment, she said yes! So did I, to my everlasting shame. I said more, even, but not because I wanted to. Because I felt trapped, and scared, and I was always way too much of a people-pleaser. I was so afraid I&rsquo;d upset him, because I <em>did</em> really like him, and I didn&rsquo;t want to screw my chances for the future when the situation might actually have felt right. My skin was crawling the entire time, my mind buzzing with a million and one reasons why I was a fucking idiot to have even landed myself there. I could never fully, or even mostly, blame myself – after all, he was the one who stripped me of my clothes without so much as a word when I was frozen up in panic, and there was a <em>huge</em> imbalance in power and experience between us that did not favour me. But of course I blamed myself, in part.</p>
<p>So was that rape, or was it not? Believe me, I endured a truly exhausting number of arguments both ways, to the point that I really want never to have to try to address that question again. The Q&amp;A with the filmmaker was really excellent because it gave me the liberating answer: <em>it doesn&rsquo;t fucking matter</em>. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether it was <em>technically</em> rape, or whether I <em>technically</em> consented, or at what exact point of drunkenness one is <em>technically</em> too drunk to consent, or whether there&rsquo;s some kind of sliding scale whereby you can be partially, but not fully, responsible for &ldquo;consenting&rdquo; against your better judgement. Literally none of the bullshit I had to fight about, over and over again, matters at all. The only thing that matters is &ldquo;people having a good time&rdquo;. And by that metric, he utterly failed.</p>
<p>The problem is, I don&rsquo;t think we have good language for it, this kind of callous sexual behaviour that, perhaps, falls short of being rape. The protagonist of the film is never really able to find the words for what happens to her; at most, I remember her saying weakly, &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t really count though.&rdquo; I remember trying to use that same line myself, once, with someone who was trying to &ldquo;YEAHHH YOU GETTEM GIRL&rdquo; me just like Tara&rsquo;s shitty friend was at that point in the film. But in my case, I also had other people – <strong>so many people</strong><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> – arguing with me very sternly that if I was drunk I couldn&rsquo;t consent and it was <em>rape</em>, and scolding me if I ever failed to call it <em>rape</em>, so I did used to call it that, but it always felt uncomfortably <em>off</em>. I ended up clinging to it anyway, because what else was I going to call it? It was either that or nothing, and I was <em>really</em> sure that what happened wasn&rsquo;t nothing. My &ldquo;Paddy&rdquo; actually became a close friend – not a <em>good</em> friend, but a close one – but the events of that night were always a sticking point between us. Interestingly, given the topic, he did actually accept the label &ldquo;rapist&rdquo;, but he also treated it as a bit of joke. I guess he was defensive; I don&rsquo;t think he ever truly accepted he&rsquo;d done anything I hadn&rsquo;t wanted that night. I was defensive, too, because I knew that he had. For all that the word &ldquo;rape&rdquo; sat uneasily with me, I used it because consensual sex isn&rsquo;t what it felt like either. I clung to it because it felt like anything else would&rsquo;ve been letting him off the hook. If there had been a better word, one that correctly assigned the blame to him for <em>hurting</em> me without trying to imply consent is always a black and white yes–no binary, then sure, I&rsquo;d have preferred to use that. But that word doesn&rsquo;t exist. Probably it should.</p>
<p>What I really wanted was for him to change. As his friend, I saw all his good qualities too. I was sure he was capable of doing better, being better, than he had been with me (&hellip;and a bunch of other girls about the same age, in different ways, but that&rsquo;s by-the-by). He was a <em>feminist</em>, he claimed; <em>surely</em> he could come to understand the complicated interplay between power dynamics and sex! And so&hellip; I really appreciated Manning Walker&rsquo;s insistence on the same thing, that men can and must learn to be better, rather than &ldquo;rapist&rdquo; becoming a lifelong label that someone can never, ever grow free from. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve so rarely heard articulated but it strikes me as obviously true. I haven&rsquo;t spoken to my ex-friend in more than a decade now but I really hope he did, eventually, learn.</p>
<p>One last thing I&rsquo;ll say about this film is that it also depicts that really obnoxious kind of &ldquo;British people getting shitfaced at resorts in southern Europe&rdquo; subculture, which is definitely not my thing. In fact, before I realised what the movie was really about, I&rsquo;d thought I was going to have to tease Viv for taking me to a movie about the three most annoying English girls in film history. Basically they arrive in Greece with two goals: to get wasted and to get laid&hellip; and with the life experience I&rsquo;ve had, I find it truly gobsmacking that <em>anyone</em> would still think these are two things that can be combined.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t quite figure out the position the film took on this. You might think, given the subject matter, that it came down firmly against it, but I didn&rsquo;t feel it did. I felt it kind of implied that it <em>is</em> possible to have sex (in a healthy, non-abusive way) when you&rsquo;re shitfaced, it&rsquo;s just Paddy didn&rsquo;t do that, and&hellip; that&rsquo;s not a message I&rsquo;m comfortable with. Of course, given my experiences, I gave a lot of thought back in the day to what it is that <em>makes</em> drunk sex (potentially) abusive, and the thing I kept coming back to is power. Two adults who respect each other as equals, and feel comfortable around each other&hellip; it&rsquo;s unlikely to be abusive in that case. But when you have a power imbalance – like when one of the parties is a young, frightened, virgin – it becomes very problematic, very quickly. So&hellip; I was very uncomfortable with the atmosphere of the resort in the film, which is full of <em>very</em> young adults who seem to have the expectation that they <em>can</em> get fucked up and <em>also</em> have sex with almost total strangers&hellip; like, of course this is going to end badly, what the hell! I just think there needs to be a complete division in people&rsquo;s minds, where &ldquo;partying/clubbing&rdquo; and &ldquo;hooking up&rdquo; are completely unrelated activities. Honestly, there&rsquo;s basically a zero percent chance that a drunken hookup with a guy you barely know is going to feel any good, anyway. I&rsquo;ll admit it&rsquo;s easy for me to say now, as an adult very far removed from that eighteen-year-old girl embarrassed about her ongoing virginity and insecure about whether anyone would ever find her attractive (as Tara, in the film, also is, despite her brash exterior). Even so&hellip; caving in to the advances of a pushy drunk guy who doesn&rsquo;t really care about you at all is not the way. Which is not to try to victim-blame&hellip; the pushy guys are still, ultimately, the ones with the responsibility. I just don&rsquo;t think girls, either, should have this expectation of getting laid on a holiday where they plan to be drunk 24/7. It&rsquo;s not worth the risk, man! Save the hookups for when you&rsquo;re sober.</p>

## US Muslims to Begin Ramadan Observance as War Rages in Gaza

date: 2024-03-07, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Islamic month of Ramadan is being observed this year as the Israel-Hamas war surges in Gaza, where the United Nations is warning of a growing humanitarian crisis.


Imam Talib Shareef of Masjid Muhammad, the Nation’s Mosque, in Washington said there will be differences in how Muslims observe this year because of the conflict.


Other than organizing prayers for the community, the mosque is "more engaged in service and feeding; we actually feed at the masjid and [also at] shelters, and we also go to other faith communities," said Shareef, who served for more than 30 years in the U.S. Air Force and helped to establish the first Islamic military chaplain in 1993.




"I do expect that … religious communities are going to be trying to come together," he said, noting that his mosque also works with churches and gives food to others in the community.


"Obviously [the conflict] is going to be on people's hearts, on people's souls, it's bothering people," Shareef said.


Nearly 2 billion Muslims around the world will begin observing the Islamic month of Ramadan, which is expected to begin on March 10 or 11, depending on the sighting of the moon.


During the month of Ramadan, Muslims abstain from food, drink, smoking, gossip and sexual relations from sunrise to sunset. Fasting is meant to bring Muslims closer to God and help them better empathize with those who are less fortunate.


US Muslims


In the United States, the Muslim population is about 3.45 million, which accounts for slightly more than 1% of the population, according to Pew Research.


Depending on where Muslims live in the United States, their experience can vary. In some rural areas, Muslims may not have access to a mosque or a community where they can practice their faith.


This is particularly true for immigrants who move to areas without a large Muslim population.




Jemal Yasin, who immigrated to the U.S. from Ethiopia in 2008 to do postgraduate research at the University of Vermont, described his first experience in the United States as "a little bit lonely."


He said there was a community of Somali immigrants, though he didn’t get a chance to pray with them.


During that first year in the States, he said he had to "pray in my room by myself," which he said was a typical experience of many Muslim immigrants.


Now, Yasin is president of the board of directors of a the First Hijrah Foundation in Washington.


The FHF started as a small organization that aimed to "promote and preserve the Islamic heritage," and "foster the Islamic principles of brotherhood, equality, mutual assistance and teachings of peace, love and justice," according to its website.


Initially, the organization didn't have a building, and members of the foundation would meet at one another's houses. It wasn't until 2005 that their current building was officially secured, said Yasin.


"This is a center for Muslims, all Muslims. … So, when you come here, you see [people of many] backgrounds – African Americans, Ethiopians, Somalians, Arabs – they will come pray together and break fast together, so this is a place for everybody," Yasin said.


He added that the foundation works with the community and organizes events for Muslims, before, during and after Ramadan.


When he moved to Washington later in 2008 Yasin became involved with the foundation and was able to be part of a larger Muslim community.


Ramadan observations are becoming more common in the United States, with many organizations hosting events to observe the month.


Shareef said, "We used to have more … private iftars in the past, and now they're more open … and we are able to share more."


After sunset, Muslims typically gather for iftar — the breaking of the fast and the most important meal of the day.


Yasin said the foundation helped organize a bazaar on Sunday to help the community prepare for Ramadan. Traditional clothing, incense and foods, such as dates, were sold.


During Ramadan, the First Hijrah Foundation will be providing free iftars for the community each night.


Ramadan this year


The ongoing Israel-Hamas war is the result of an October 7 terror attack in which Hamas crossed into Israel, killing more than 1,200 people and taking more than 240 civilians hostage. The Israeli military response has killed more than 30,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health ministry.


Negotiators are pushing for a possible cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas conflict ahead of the start of Ramadan.

## US Indictment Details Russian Oligarch’s Sanctions-Busting Scheme

date: 2024-03-07, from: VOA News USA

washington — On Facebook, Vadim Wolfson makes his political position clear. His profile picture shows him in a baseball cap emblazoned with the words “Puck Futin,” while his banner image features a Russian anti-war flag.


In words and memes, Wolfson criticizes Russian President Vladimir Putin, top Russian officials and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.


But Wolfson — who formerly went by the last name Belyaev and founded the Otkritie financial group, once Russia’s largest private bank — is now accused of crimes that would appear to contradict these political views.


U.S. federal prosecutors say that in 2018 and 2019, the Austin, Texas, resident helped Andrei Kostin, an oligarch and head of Russia’s state VTB Bank, to own and manage an elite mansion in Colorado. That would have violated U.S. sanctions against the banker.


Wolfson was detained in Austin on February 22 but was soon released on his own recognizance. He is charged with violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which forms the foundation of the sanctions regime, and with conspiracy to violate it. Each charge could carry up to 20 years in prison.




Kostin is charged with sanctions violations, conspiracy to violate sanctions and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Each count is also punishable by up to 20 years behind bars. He remains at large, likely in Russia.


The charges, announced in a U.S. Justice Department press release last month, shed light on the alleged holdings of Kostin, whose bank is sometimes called "Putin's piggy bank,” and his alleged efforts to evade sanctions.




Kostin has called these accusations “baseless.”


“I have never violated any legislation, including American legislation, I have never circumvented any sanctions, and I urge all my partners not to look for or invent any ways to circumvent them, but to build a different world, independent of the pressure of the political elite and the U.S. military lobby,” he said in a comment published by Russia’s state Tass news agency.


In a message, Wolfson declined to comment on the lawsuit or answer questions from VOA. Regarding his political views, he said the following: “Since you read my FB, draw your own conclusions.”


Home in the Rocky Mountains


According to the indictment, Kostin purchased a luxury home in Aspen, Colorado, for $13.5 million in 2010. The formal owner of the house was the Colorado company 40 North Star LLC, and Kostin controlled it through a series of offshore companies, prosecutors say.


Two years later, he purchased three artworks for the house for $1 million. According to the indictment, they are the paintings "Combing the Ridges" by William Robinson Leigh and "Long in the Saddle" and "Arapaho Attack" by Wilhelm Heinrich Detlev Koerner. Both artists are famous for depicting the people and landscapes of the American West.


Prosecutors say that from 2010 to 2017, Kostin and his family spent around two weeks at the Aspen home every year, usually during the winter holidays.


Wolfson and his family also spent time there.


Using the parcel map for Pitkin County, where Aspen is located, Voice of America was able to identify the mansion.




It is located to the southeast of downtown Aspen. According to real estate website Zillow, the 1,027-square-meter (11,054-square-foot) home includes seven bedrooms and 10 bathrooms and features a swimming pool, sauna, whirlpool spa, home cinema and billiard room.


Today, the house rents for $600,000 per month, according to Zillow. It is currently owned by a company that appears to have no connection to Kostin or Wolfson.




Voice of America also found an image of the painting “Combing the Ridges” by Leigh.




The situation became complicated in 2014, after Russia illegally annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea. The United States and European countries began imposing sanctions on Russia and prominent Russian politicians and businesspeople.


Soon, the Aspen mansion’s ownership structure changed.


According to prosecutors, in 2014, Altamonte Holding Limited, a company recently registered in the British Virgin Islands, purchased 40 North Star LLC for $10 million.


A database of offshore leaks maintained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists indicates that the beneficial owner of a BVI company with a nearly identical name — Altamonte Holdings Limited — is Vadim Belyaev (aka Wolfson).


A company ultimately owned by Kostin, Capital Business Finance, provided financing for the purchase, the indictment states.


In April 2018, the United States imposed sanctions on Kostin. The following year, Wolfson bought 40 North Star for $12 million through two financial transactions with a subsidiary of Capital Business Finance controlled by Kostin. The deal violated the sanctions, prosecutors state in the indictment.


In 2018-20, it was Wolfson who primarily used the Aspen home. According to the parcel register, in 2020 the home was sold to another company for $12.5 million. The current owner appears not to be connected to Kostin or Wolfson.

Out at sea


The indictment does not end with real estate and art. Prosecutors also contend Kostin controlled two yachts through offshore companies: Sea Rhapsody and Sea & Us.


According to the document, Kostin mainly used the former yacht with his wife and family, while he primarily spent time on the latter with his mistress.


That latter yacht appeared in a 2019 investigation by the late Russian opposition activist Alexey Navalny, which dealt with the relationship between Kostin and Nailya Asker-zade, a presenter on the state TV channel Rossiya.




Prosecutors say Kostin bought the 66-meter (217-foot) Sea Rhapsody for $65 million between 2008 and 2012. It was built according to his order. It features six luxury cabins, an infinity pool, a whirlpool spa and a cinema.


Sea & Us is 62 meters (203 feet) long and was custom built for the banker in 2016-18. He paid at least $70 million for it.


According to prosecutors, in 2018-22, Kostin and unnamed accomplices carried out a scheme to provide financing, goods and services to operate, maintain and improve the yachts.


The indictment states they engaged in money laundering by transporting monetary instruments and funds in and out of the United States but does not provide further details of these activities.


According to maritime analytics site marinetraffic.com, Sea Rhapsody is now moored in Victoria, the capital of the Seychelles.


Sea & Us was renamed Serenity and Unity. According to the tracker, it is currently off the coast of Turkey.


Prosecutors are seeking the forfeiture of property and funds that they say Kostin, Wolfson and others obtained by committing the crimes listed in the indictment.

## The future that never was

date: 2024-03-07, from: OS News

Just before the end of 1989, Microsoft made available the first pre-release version of the long promised 32-bit OS/2 2.0, which was intended to be the first mass-market 32-bit PC operating system. This was accompanied by a press release detailing the $2,600 OS/2 2.0 Software Development Kit (SDK). Unfortunately, the December 1989 pre-release of OS/2 2.0 may not have survived to the present day. But in June 1990, Microsoft shipped the second pre-release of the OS/2 2.0 SDK. And that version has now turned up, after twenty years of searching, and nearly a quarter century after its release! ↫ Michal Necasek at OS/2 Museum OS/2 is one of the biggest what-ifs in tech, and the whole origin story and demise of the platform is worthy of a big budget drama series. It also happens to be one of my favourite retrocomputing platforms of all time, so I may be biased.

## US House Passes $460 Billion Package of Spending Bills to Avert Deadline

date: 2024-03-07, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The House passed a $460 billion package of spending bills Wednesday that would keep money flowing to key federal agencies through the remainder of the budget year. The Senate is expected to take up the legislation before a midnight Friday shutdown deadline. 


Lawmakers are negotiating a second package of six bills, including defense, in an effort to have all federal agencies fully funded before a March 22 deadline. In the end, total discretionary spending set by Congress is expected to come in at about $1.66 trillion for the full year. 


A significant number of House Republicans have lined up in opposition to the spending packages, forcing House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, to use an expedited process to bring the bill up for a vote. That process requires two-thirds of the House to vote for the measure for it to pass. 


The House passed the measure by a vote of 339-85. 


The nondefense spending in this year's bills is relatively flat compared with the previous year. Supporters say that keeping that spending below the rate of inflation is tantamount to a cut, forcing agencies to be more frugal and focus manpower on top priorities. Johnson cited a 10% cut to the Environmental Protection Agency, a 7% cut to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and a 6% cut to the FBI. 




But many Republican lawmakers were seeking much steeper cuts and more policy victories. The House Freedom Caucus, which contains dozens of the GOP's most conservative members, urged Republicans to vote against the first spending package and oppose the second one being negotiated. 


"Despite giving Democrats higher spending levels, the omnibus text released so far punts on nearly every single Republican policy priority," the group said. 


Johnson countered that House Republicans have just a two-vote majority in the House while Democrats control the Senate and White House. 


"We have to be realistic about what we're able to achieve," Johnson said. 


Democrats staved off most of the riders that House Republicans sought to include in the package. For example, they beat back an effort to block new rules that expand access to the abortion pill mifepristone. 


Democrats also said the bill would fully fund a nutrition program for low-income women, infants and children, providing about $7 billion for what is known as the WIC program. That's a $1 billion increase from the previous year. 


"The bill certainly doesn't have everything that we may have wanted, but I am very proud to say we successfully defeated the vast majority of the extreme cuts and hundreds of harmful policy riders proposed by the House Republicans," said lawmaker Rosa DeLauro, the top-ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. 




House Republicans were able to achieve some policy wins, however. One provision, for example, will prevent the sale of oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China. Another policy mandate prohibits the Justice Department from investigating parents who exercise free speech at local school board meetings. 


Another provision strengthens gun rights for certain veterans. 


Under current law, the Department of Veterans Affairs must send a beneficiary's name to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System whenever a fiduciary is appointed to help manage someone's benefits because they lack the mental capacity to manage their own affairs. This year's spending package prohibits the department from transmitting that information unless a relevant judicial authority rules that the beneficiary is a danger to himself or herself, or others. 


The bills to fund federal agencies are more than five months past due, with the budget year beginning October 1. House Republicans are describing an improved process nevertheless, saying they have broken the cycle of passing all the spending bills in one massive package that lawmakers have little time to study before being asked to vote on it or risk a government shutdown.

## Google’s changes to comply with the DMA

date: 2024-03-07, from: OS News

The European Union&#8217;s Digital Markets Act (DMA) comes into force this week for companies who have been designated. Today, we are sharing some more details about the changes we are making to comply, following product testing we announced earlier this year. ↫ Oliver Bethell on the official Google blog This is Google&#8217;s overview of the changes it&#8217;s implementing to comply with the DMA, some of which the company already announced months ago. Google&#8217;s changes don&#8217;t have as much of a direct, noticeable impact as some other company&#8217;s changes, mostly since a lot of the more impactful consequences of the DMA, such as allowing sideloading and alternative application stores, were already allowed on Android. Other changes, like to Search, will take longer to be noticed. The one thing that stands out is the tone &#8211; compared to Apple&#8217;s communication around the DMA. Whereas Apple sounds like a petulant whiny toddler, Google sounds constructive, to the point, and, well, like an adult. That doesn&#8217;t mean Google&#8217;s post isn&#8217;t also full of shit in places, but at least they&#8217;re being grown-ups about it.

## Set a static IP address with nmtui on Raspberry Pi OS 12 'Bookworm'

date: 2024-03-06, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Set a static IP address with nmtui on Raspberry Pi OS 12 'Bookworm'</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Old advice for setting a Raspberry Pi IP address to a static IP on the Pi itself said to edit the <code>/etc/dhcpcd.conf</code> file, and add it there.</p>

<p>But on Raspberry Pi OS 12 and later, <code>dhcpcd</code> is no longer used, everything goes through Network Manager, which is configured via <code>nmcli</code> or <code>nmtui</code>.</p>

<p>So setting a static IP via the command line is a little different.</p>

<p>First, get the interface information—you can get a list of all interfaces with <code>nmcli device status</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ nmcli device status
DEVICE         TYPE      STATE                   CONNECTION         
eth0           ethernet  connected               Wired connection 1 
lo             loopback  connected (externally)  lo                 
wlan0          wifi      disconnected            --                 
</code></pre>

<p>In my case, I want to set an IP on <code>eth0</code>, the built-in Ethernet.</p>

<p>I can get all the current information about that port with <code>nmcli device show eth0</code>, and I can edit the connection using the terminal UI (<code>nmtui</code>):</p></div>

## Q&A: White House Will Persist in Bid for Ukraine Aid, Kirby Says

date: 2024-03-06, from: VOA News USA

White House  — The Biden administration is looking at options to support Ukraine amid House Republicans’ continued obstruction of a Senate-approved $95 billion foreign aid package that includes $61 billion to support Kyiv in its fight against Russia.


In a Wednesday interview with VOA, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said President Joe Biden plans to use Thursday’s State of the Union address to emphasize the importance of continued support for Ukraine and highlight his administration’s success in “restoring American leadership.”


The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.


VOA: How will the president use this opportunity to convince lawmakers and House Speaker Mike Johnson of the urgent need for military support for Ukraine?


John Kirby, White House National Security Communications Adviser: I don't want to get ahead of the president's speech. Of course, he's very much looking forward to the opportunity to talk to the American people, to the Congress, and actually, quite frankly, the world about all the incredible things that he has accomplished in these three and a half years as the president of the United States. From the economy to education, to health care, to employment, as well as on the world stage, and really restoring American leadership on the world stage.


Here's what American leadership buys you. It buys you convening power. It buys you enormous capability. And it certainly buys you an effort to influence and affect the decision-making and the actions of other leaders around the world, particularly adversaries, in ways that are more in keeping with our national security interests. And supporting Ukraine is certainly first and foremost. That's about helping Ukrainian soldiers succeed in these fights against Russian aggression, but it's also a benefit to our national security because the landscape on the European continent has changed. And if we just walk away and let [Russian President Vladimir] Putin have Ukraine, which is what he still wants, then he's right up against the doorstop of NATO.


VOA: Ukraine is rationing munitions and losing territory in part because of the lack of American support. Do you still see a path forward with the supplemental package or should Ukrainians be preparing themselves for the reality where there is no American assistance?


Kirby: We're going to keep working with Congress to see if we can get that supplemental passed. It's that important. We are also working with allies and partners about contributions that they might be able to make, not that they aren't already making them — they are. But [we’re] seeing what more could maybe be done. And of course, we're looking inside our own system, inside our own government, and across the administration to see if there's anything else that we might be able to do to support Ukraine. But we've got nothing. None of those efforts are going to be able to replace the volume, the scale that the supplemental would provide us.


VOA: But there might be a Plan B?


Kirby: We have never not looked at what other opportunities we might have before us. But whatever they are, they're not going to be as good as the supplemental. There's no replacing the supplemental. As I've said many times, it's not like there's some magical source out there that can do what the supplemental can do. But are we looking at options? We absolutely are. We have to, given the situation on the ground — particularly in the east.


VOA: But do you still believe the supplemental may pass?


Kirby: It's difficult to say with any certainty. That's really going to be up to Speaker Johnson. We know — and Speaker Johnson knows — that if you put that to the floor, it'll pass. There's plenty of bipartisan support for that; both sides of the aisle in the House. No question about that. The question is really: Will he put it to the floor? And only he can answer that question.


VOA: Six countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, Germany, Denmark and France, recently signed bilateral security agreements with Kyiv that are meant to give Ukraine security reassurance before Ukraine joins NATO. Should we expect such an agreement between the United States and Ukraine soon?


Kirby: We have long been working with the Ukrainians, obviously making sure that they have what they need in this war, talking to them about what they're going to need whenever the war ends, because whenever and however the war ends, they're still going to have a long border with Russia that they're going to need to safeguard. So, yes, the United States is talking to our Ukrainian counterparts about what more we can do over the long term to help make sure that they can defend their own national security interests and [those of] the Ukrainian people. I don't have anything to announce or speak to right now, but these are conversations we're having with the Ukrainians.


VOA: More on the State of the Union: How will the president address the worsening situation in Gaza and U.S. strategic competition with China?


Kirby: Again, I'm not going to get ahead of the president's speech, but I would point you to the things that he has said before. On Israel: How important it is to make sure Israel can defend itself against the still viable threat by Hamas, making sure that more humanitarian assistance gets in [to Gaza, and] making sure we get the hostages out. Trying to get this new hostage deal in place so that we can get a six-week temporary cease-fire to reduce the suffering on the ground and again try to find ways to help alleviate suffering of the Palestinian people.


And on China, as you know, the president wrapped up not too long ago a meeting with President Xi [Jinping] in San Francisco. Good, constructive dialogue. We're not going to agree with China on everything, but the president believes strongly that this is the most consequential bilateral relationship in the world, and it's incumbent upon both of us as two major powers — and both of them as two major leaders — to handle that relationship in a responsible way.


VOA: The president warned of a "dangerous" situation if there is no cease-fire by Ramadan. What did he mean by that? Is he warning of more bloodshed and potential regional spillover?


Kirby: He's referring to the fact that Ramadan is obviously the holiest time of the year for Muslims and it's also a sensitive time, particularly in the Middle East, where actions take on an even larger meaning and can have an outsized impact. And so, we all want this temporary cease-fire in place as soon as possible. We obviously would have preferred to have it in place already. It's not, we're still working at that. But we recognize that as you get closer to Ramadan, whatever actions get taken is done in the context of this holiest of time for Muslims around the world.


VOA: Both the first lady of Ukraine, Olena Zelenska, and the widow of a deceased Russian opposition leader Yulia Navalnaya declined the invitation to attend Biden’s State of the Union address. What message was the administration trying to convey by inviting them both?


Kirby: We certainly respect their desires in terms of not attending, but obviously Ukraine is such a key partner here. And they have been fighting bravely now for a little bit over two years. And, certainly, this was an opportunity to recognize America's commitment to Ukraine, and to the fighting, the courage and resilience of the Ukrainian people.


Again, we all mourned the passing of Alexey Navalny, and we all recognize his courage, his bravery, and we all of course continue to hold the Kremlin accountable for what happened to him. The president had a chance to meet with his wife and his sister to express his personal condolences and the condolences of the entire American people

## Adding systemd to postmarketOS

date: 2024-03-06, from: OS News

You heard it here first folks: systemd is coming to postmarketOS! As a mobile oriented OS, our main goal has always been to work for everyone. From technical folks to casual users. postmarketOS should have all the benefits you expect from a Linux based distribution, such as being free software, respecting your privacy, getting updates until your device physically breaks, respecting your attention and not shoving advertisements in your face. Your phone should be a tool you use, not the other way around. This is of course not an easy task, one of the main blockers we found as we collaborate more closely with KDE and GNOME developers is that they have a hard time with our OpenRC-based stack. In order to get KDE and GNOME working at all, we use a lot of systemd polyfills on top of OpenRC. So while we are technically &#8220;not using systemd&#8221;, in practice we already do use a large chunk of its components to get KDE and GNOME running, just different versions of those components. While we are very grateful for everybody who works on these polyfills, we must point out that most aren&#8217;t a full replacement, and take additional effort to support and maintain. As much as we might want to romanticise the idea of spending 6, 12, 24 months attempting to come up with an even vaguely competitive alternative to systemd, we would quite simply rather be working on making postmarketOS better. ↫ postmarketOS blog This is the sensible choice to make, and I&#8217;m glad they made it. It makes no sense for a relatively small project that already has to deal with the difficulties of supporting smartphones to also have to deal with shoehorning the smartphone variants of GNOME and KDE into an init system they&#8217;re not at all made for.

## 2024-03-06 Oddµ beta program for Campaign Wiki

date: 2024-03-06, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>2024-03-06 Oddµ beta program for Campaign Wiki</h1>

<p>Campaign Wiki offers a basic wiki for people wanting to keep campaign records for their role-playing games.
I&rsquo;ve been developing a new software that&rsquo;s now <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/view/index">available for beta testing</a>. That is to say: I think it&rsquo;s ready. I&rsquo;ve been using it for this site for a while, now.</p>

<p>What hasn&rsquo;t been tested is 1. its usability (how well can it be used by people that are mainly interested in their games and not their software) and 2. it&rsquo;s permission setup (the new site no longer allows editing by strangers: you need an account to edit the site).</p>

<p>Well, as soon as the first person signed up, problems started showing up in both areas! 😅</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve been busy fixing bugs and writing documentation.</p>

date: 2024-03-06, from: OS News

Every day, people turn to Search to find the best of what the web has to offer. We’ve long had policies and automated systems to fight against spammers, and we work to address emerging tactics that look to game our results with low-quality content. We regularly update those policies and systems to effectively tackle these trends so we can continue delivering useful content and connecting people with high-quality websites. Today we’re announcing key changes we’re making to improve the quality of Search and the helpfulness of your results. ↫ Elizabeth Tucker on the official Google blog Low-quality SEO spam has been a problem on Google for years, but the recent advent of &#8220;AI&#8221; tools has wreaked absolute havoc in the search results. It&#8217;s a damn blood bath out there. It&#8217;s not up to Google to fix its own mess, so let&#8217;s wait and see if these changes will do anything to reverse the downward spiral Google Search has been in for years now.

FreeBSD 13.3 has been released, and as this is a point release of the stable branch, it&#8217;s not a major shake-up or overhaul of the platform. We&#8217;ve got the usual updated versions of LLVM, clang, OpenSSH, and so on, and there&#8217;s a number of stability fixes to native and LinuxKPI-based WiFi drivers.

## US Urges Iran to Dilute All Its Near-Weapons-Grade Uranium

date: 2024-03-06, from: VOA News USA

vienna — The United States on Wednesday called on Iran to dilute all of the uranium it has enriched to up to 60% purity, close to the weapons-grade level of roughly 90%, in a statement denouncing many of Tehran's recent nuclear moves.


The International Atomic Energy Agency said in a confidential report to member states last week that Iran's stock of uranium enriched to up to 60% had fallen slightly in the past quarter as it had diluted, or "downblended," more of its most highly enriched material than it had produced.


Iran still has enough of that material, if enriched further, to fuel two nuclear weapons by a theoretical IAEA definition, and enough for more bombs at lower enrichment levels, the report seen by Reuters showed.


"Iran should downblend all, not just some, of its 60% stockpile, and stop all production of uranium enriched to 60% entirely," the United States said in a statement on Iran to a quarterly meeting of the 35-nation IAEA Board of Governors.


It is not clear why Iran downblended the material. It denies seeking nuclear weapons and says it has the right to enrich to high levels for civil purposes. Western powers say there is no credible civil justification for enriching to such high levels.


"We continue to have serious concerns related to the stockpile of highly enriched uranium that Iran continues to maintain," the U.S. statement said.


"No other country today is producing uranium enriched to 60% for the purpose Iran claims and Iran's actions are counter to the behavior of all other non-nuclear weapons states party to the NPT [Non-Proliferation Treaty]," it added.


The United States also condemned various moves by Iran, many of which the IAEA has also criticized, such as barring some of the IAEA's most experienced and expert inspectors last year.

## Google wants to redirect traffic from AI-generated spam blogs to legit websites

date: 2024-03-06, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Google is one of the most important vectors for online spammers and scammers. The search engine&#8217;s dominance means that, if you want to generate traffic — a.k.a. potential marks — you&#8217;ll probably need to convince Google&#8217;s algorithm to send it your way.

## US Targets Houthi Revenue With New Sanctions

date: 2024-03-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The United States on Wednesday issued sanctions targeting two companies and two vessels that the Treasury Department said had facilitated commodities shipments on behalf of a network of an Iranian-backed Houthi financial facilitator.


The action targets two Hong Kong- and Marshall Islands-based ship owners and two vessels for their role in shipping commodities on behalf of Sa'id al-Jamal, the Treasury Department said in a statement.


The revenue from the commodity sales supports the Houthis and their attacks against international shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, the department said.


Wednesday's action represented the latest bid by the U.S. to pressure the Iran-backed Houthi militant group over attacks in shipping. Last month, Washington imposed sanctions on oil tankers as well as two companies it accused of working with al-Jamal.

## Windows to add gobs of “AI” to Explorer

date: 2024-03-06, from: OS News

According to my sources, AI Explorer is the blockbuster AI experience that will separate AI PCs from non-AI PCs. It&#8217;s described as an &#8220;advanced Copilot&#8221; with a built-in history/timeline feature that turns everything you do on your computer into a searchable moment using natural language. It works across any app and allows users to search for previously opened conversations, documents, web pages, and images. For example, you could type, &#8220;Find me that list of restaurants Jenna said she liked,&#8221; and Windows can bring up the exact conversation you were having when Jenna mentioned those restaurants. Even vague prompts should work, like &#8220;Find me that thing about dinosaurs,&#8221; Windows will pull up every word, phrase, image, and related topic about dinosaurs that you&#8217;ve previously opened on your computer. The AI Explorer app can also understand context, help jumpstart projects or workflows, and even suggest tasks based on what&#8217;s currently on screen. For example, suppose you&#8217;re looking at an image in an app. In that case, the AI Explorer will automatically show an &#8220;edit image&#8221; button that lets you type out your criteria, such as &#8220;remove this image&#8217;s background using the Photos app.&#8221; ↫ Zac Bowden Windows, for all your &#8220;AI&#8221; and ads.

## The One Big Change to the SEC’s Climate Rule

date: 2024-03-06, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTY0Njk3Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1Nzk3MjM2MH0.YkgTA7ivnix7utGoBHonNoBt5T6P0mQ8eIyDg6zO7Mw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">The Securities and Exchange Commission approved a <a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/sec-climate-disclosure-rule" target="_self">highly anticipated rule</a> on Wednesday that will require companies to disclose information about their climate-related risks to investors. But the final rule differs dramatically from the proposal the Commission released two years ago, with significantly weaker provisions that leave it up to companies to decide how much information to share.</p><p>Perhaps the most dramatic change: Most of the climate-related disclosures the rule covers are now mandatory only if they’re considered “material.” Under the original rule, all public companies would have been required to calculate and report the greenhouse gas emissions they are directly responsible for, known as scope 1 emissions, and the emissions from the electricity they use, known as scope 2 — no exceptions. But under the final rule, companies only have to report this information if they deem it material — i.e. if there is “a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the ‘total mix’ of information made available,” according to a 1976 Supreme Court decision. </p><p>Further, only about 40% of domestic public companies will even be required to consider whether their emissions are material. Smaller companies and emerging growth businesses — generally companies with less than $1.2 billion in annual revenues — are exempt.</p><p>Part of the impetus for the rule was to standardize climate disclosures. Though many companies already publicly report information about their emissions and climate-related risks, they do so sporadically, using different methodologies, adopting different formats, and publishing across different forums. Steven Rothstein, a managing director at the nonprofit Ceres, once <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/california-climate-corporate-data-accountability-act-financial-risk" target="_self">told me</a> it was like a “climate ‘Tower of Babel.’”</p><p>The final rule will still create a more formal, consistent, public reporting system for this information. But the picture it provides to investors will be incomplete. “By shifting to a materiality standard, they are leaving a huge gap in the information available to investors and the public,” Kathy Fallon, the director of land and climate at the Clean Air Task Force told me. “That's going to hurt companies and the climate in the long run.” </p><p>This wasn’t entirely unexpected. The original proposal ignited a firestorm from Republican attorneys general and business groups accusing the SEC of trying to pass back-door climate regulations, overstepping its role, and saddling companies with burdensome reporting costs. The Commission received more than 20,000 comments on the proposal, more than any rule in its history. As the pressure grew, reports emerged that the Commission planned to remove a requirement that companies tally up and report a third category of their emissions, known as scope 3, which includes those associated with their supply chains and the use of their products. Then last week, <em>Reuters</em> reported that the SEC would also soften the requirements for disclosing scope 1 and 2 emissions by subjecting them to this materiality test. </p><p>Before the vote on Wednesday, Erik Gerding, director of the SEC’s division of corporation finance, emphasized that the final rule struck an “appropriate balance” between investor demand for more consistent, comparable, information about climate-related risks, and “the concerns expressed by many companies and commenters about the potential costs of the proposed rules.”</p><p>The Commission voted along party lines, with Democratic chair Gary Gensler and commissioners Caroline Crenshaw and Jaime Lizárraga approving the rule, and Republican commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda voting against. But no one appeared satisfied.</p><p>Peirce argued that companies were already required to inform investors about material risks and trends, including those related to climate change. She accused the staff of having merely “decorated the final rule with materiality ribbons” while still creating an overly prescriptive rule. “The resulting flood of climate related disclosures will overwhelm investors, not inform them,” she said.</p><p>Crenshaw said the rule was a “bare minimum” step forward that would “move a haphazard potpourri of public company disclosures into the Commission's well-developed and standardized filing ecosystem.” But she also worried that it would pass the buck to future commissions to ensure investors are getting the information they actually need. “To be crystal clear, this is not the rule I would have written,” she said. “Today's rule is better for investors than no rule at all, and that's why it has my vote. But while it has my vote, it does not have my unencumbered support.”</p><p><span></span>There is no specific test to determine whether emissions are considered material. But the climate disclosure rule does discuss some examples of when a company’s scope 1 or scope 2 emissions may be material. One is if there is a transition risk associated with those emissions — for example, if a company anticipates that future regulations would increase their costs. Another is if a company has articulated a climate goal, like an ambition to achieve net-zero emissions, to the public. As with other SEC disclosures subject to a material standard, it will be entirely up to these companies to determine whether their emissions are material, and they will not have to share their analysis with investors.  </p><p>Experts don’t expect this to lead to a total lack of emissions reporting. If a company fails to disclose its emissions, it could open up the business to fines from the SEC or lawsuits from investors if the information is later determined to be, in fact, material. Many companies, prodded by their lawyers, are likely to play it safe and disclose. “It’s hard to make an argument that scope 1 emissions are not material,” Jameson McLennan, a sustainable finance analyst at BloombergNEF, told me.</p><p>But there still may be a spectrum. John Tobin, a professor of practice at Cornell University’s business school and a former managing director of sustainability at Credit Suisse, told me that big, white collar companies like banks and tech companies that don’t directly emit much may not see the need to disclose, whereas manufacturing and industrial companies that directly burn fossil fuels to produce their products, absolutely should. That being said, those white collar businesses should still consider their scope 2 emissions material, Tobin said, as they tend to use a substantial amount of electricity and could be at risk of cost increases if regulations change. </p><p>Where Tobin thinks the rule really falls short is in lacking requirements to disclose certain kinds of scope 3 emissions — particularly upstream supply chain emissions. Why would an investor care more about the emissions from the electricity Toyota uses than the emissions from the steel it buys? The latter is more likely to pose a significant risk to the company’s business due to carbon regulations. “A lot of the emissions associated with industrial activity have very little to do with electricity,” he told me. </p><p>By telling companies they only have to report emissions that are material, the Commission is essentially saying that a company’s emissions are not inherently material to an investor’s understanding of risk. Allowing companies to opt out of emissions reporting “misses the whole point of climate disclosures,” said Fallon. “The whole point is to make available the information that investors want, not just the information that companies want to give.” Investors want to know how exposed a company may be to changes in climate policies, energy prices, or shifts in consumer sentiments.</p><p>At the same time, tying the list of required disclosures to a materiality test could be what ultimately preserves the rule when it inevitably ends up in court. Many groups have already threatened to sue the commission if it exceeds its legal authority. These include the National Association of Manufacturers. </p><p>“The NAM has been clear that a failure to bring the rule back within the agency’s statutory authority could invite legal action. On the other hand, a balanced, workable rule could obviate the need for litigation,” <a href="https://nam.org/previewing-the-secs-climate-rule-30364/" target="_blank">said</a> the group’s vice president of domestic policy, Charles Crain.</p><p>The rule will still likely surface valuable information for investors and others keen to get their hands on more consistent, comparable data about certain companies’ emissions and vulnerability to climate change. But it will also leave huge reporting gaps that dilute the overall utility of that information.</p><p>“The fact that the SEC is providing uniform requirements for reporting is still an improvement upon what we had before,” said Fallon. “But the final rule doesn’t go far enough to give investors the information they need to make informed decisions.”</p><p><em>Editor’s note: This story has been updated to reflect the result of the SEC’s vote.</em><br/></p>

## Pluralistic: Electrons, not molecules (06 Mar 2024)

date: 2024-03-06, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links Electrons, not molecules: Renewables don't generate above-average returns for Exxon's shareholders. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Podcasts, events and more. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Electrons, not molecules (permalink) When hydrocarbon barons do their damndest to torch the Earth with fossil fuels, they call us dreamers. They insist that there's a hard-nosed reality &#8211; humanity needs energy &#8211; and they're the ones who live in it, while we live in the fairy land where the world can run on sunshine and virtuous thoughts. Without them making the tough decisions, we'd all be starving in the frigid dark. Here's the thing: they're full of shit. Mostly. Humanity does need energy if we're going to avoid starving in the frigid dark, but that energy doesn't have to come from fossil fuels. Indeed, in the long-term, it can't. Even if you're a rootin' tootin, coal-rollin' climate denier, there's a hard-nosed reality you can't deny: if we keep using fossil fuels, they will someday run out. Remember "peak oil" panic? Fossil fuels are finite, and the future of the human race needn't be. We need more. Thankfully, we have it. Despite what you may have heard, renewables are more than up to the task. Indeed, it's hard to overstate just how much renewable energy is available to us, here at the bottom of our gravity well. I failed to properly appreciate it until I read Deb Chachra's brilliant 2023 book, How Infrastructure Works: https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/17/care-work/#charismatic-megaprojects Chachra, an engineering prof and materials scientist, offers a mind-altering reframing of the question of energy: we have a material problem, not an energy problem. If we could capture a mere 0.4% of the sun's rays that strike the Earth, we could give every person on the planet the energy budget of a Canadian (like an American, only colder). Energy isn't just wildly abundant, though: it's also continuously replenished. For most of human history, we've treated energy as scarce, eking out marginal gains in energy efficiency &#8211; even as we treated materials as disposable, using them once and consigning them to a midden or a landfill. That's completely backwards. We get a fresh shipment of energy every time the sun (or the moon) comes up over the horizon. By contrast, new consignments of material are almost unheard of &#8211; the few odd ounces of meteoric ore that survive entry through Earth's atmosphere. A soi-dissant adult concerned with the very serious business of ensuring our species isn't doomed to the freezing, starving darkness of an energy-deprived future would think about nothing save for this fact and its implications. They'd be trying to figure out how to humanely and responsibly gather the materials needed for the harvest, storage and distribution of this nearly limitless and absolutely free energy. In other words, that Very Serious, Hard-Nosed Grown-Up should be concerned with using as few molecules as possible to harvest as many electrons as possible. They'd be working on things like turning disused coal-mines into giant gravity batteries: https://www.euronews.com/green/2024/02/06/this-disused-mine-in-finland-is-being-turned-into-a-gravity-battery-to-store-renewable-ene Not figuring out how to dig or flush more long-dead corpses out of the Earth's mantle to feed them into a furnace. That is a profoundly unserious response to the human need for energy. It's caveman shit: "Ugh, me burn black sticky gunk, make cave warm, cough cough cough." Enter Exxon CEO Darren Woods, whose interview with Fortune's Michal Lev-Ram and editor Alan Murray contains this telling quote: "we basically focus our technology on transforming molecules and they happen to be hydrogen and carbon molecules": https://fortune.com/2024/02/28/leadership-next-exxonmobil-ceo-darren-woods/ As Bill McKibben writes, this is a tell. A company that's in the molecule business is not in the electron business. For all that Woods postures about being a clear-eyed realist beating back the fantasies of solarpunk-addled greenies, Woods does not want a future where we have all our energy needs met: https://billmckibben.substack.com/p/the-most-epic-and-literal-gaslighting That's because the only way to get that future is to shift from molecules &#8211; whose supply can be owned and therefore sold by Exxon &#8211; to electrons, which that commie bastard sun just hands out for free to every person on our planet's surface, despite the obvious moral hazard of all those free lunches. As Woods told Fortune, when it comes to renewables, "we don’t see the ability to generate above-average returns for our shareholders." Woods dresses this up in high-minded seriousness kabuki, saying that Exxon is continuing to invest in burning rotting corpses because our feckless species "waited too long to open the aperture on the solution sets terms of what we need as a society." In other words, it's just too late for solar. Keep shoveling those corpses into the furnace, they're all that stands between you and the freezing, starving dark. Now, this is self-serving nonsense. The problem of renewables isn't that it's too late &#8211; it's that they don't "generate above-average returns for our shareholders" (that part, however, is gospel truth). But let's stipulate that Woods sincerely believes that it is too late. It's pretty goddamned rich of this genocidal, eminently guillotineable monster to just drop that in the conversation without mentioning the role his company played in getting us to this juncture. After all, #ExxonKnew. 40 years ago, Exxon's internal research predicted climate change, connected climate change to its own profits, and predicted how bad it would be today. Those predictions were spookily accurate and the company took them to heart, leaping into action. For 40 years, the company has been building its offshore drilling platforms higher and higher in anticipation of rising seas and superstorms &#8211; and over that same period, Exxon has spent millions lobbying and sowing disinformation to make sure that the rest of us don't take the emergency as seriously as they are, lest we switch from molecules to electrons. Exxon knew, and Exxon lied. McKibben quotes Woods' predecessor Lee Raymond, speaking in the runup to the Kyoto Treaty negotiations: "It is highly unlikely that the temperature in the middle of the next century will be significantly affected whether policies are enacted now or 20 years from now." When Woods says we need to keep shoveling corpses into the furnace because we "waited too long to open the aperture on the solution sets terms of what we need as a society," he means that his company lied to us in order to convince us to wait too long. When Woods &#8211; and his fellow enemies of humanity in the C-suites of Chevron and other corpse-torching giants &#8211; was sending the arson billions to his shareholders, he held back a healthy share to fund this deceit. He colluded with the likes of Joe Manchin ("[D-POLLUTION]" -McKibben) to fill the Inflation Reduction Act with gifts for molecules. The point of fantasies like "direct air carbon-capture" is to extend the economic life of molecule businesses, by tricking us into thinking that we can keep sending billions to Exxon without suffocating in its waste-product. These lies aren't up for debate. Back in 2021, Greenpeace tricked Exxon's top DC lobbyist Keith McCoy into thinking that he was on a Zoom call with a corporate recruiter and asked him about his work for Exxon, and McCoy spilled the beans: https://pluralistic.net/2021/07/01/basilisk-tamers/#exxonknew He confessed to everything: funding fake grassroots groups and falsifying the science &#8211; he even names the senators who took his bribes. McCoy singled out Manchin for special praise, calling him "a kingmaker" and boasting about the "standing weekly calls" Exxon had with Manchin's office. Exxon's response to this nine-minute confession was to insist that their most senior American lobbyist "wasn't involved at all in forming policy positions." McKibben points to the forthcoming book The Price Is Wrong, by Brett Christophers, which explains how the neoclassical economics establishment's beloved "price signals" will continue to lead us into the furnace: https://www.versobooks.com/products/3069-the-price-is-wrong The crux of that book is: We cannot expect markets and the private sector to solve the climate crisis while the profits that are their lifeblood remain unappetizing. Nearly 100 years ago, Upton Sinclair wrote, "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it." Today, we can say that it's impossible to get an oil executive to understand that humanity needs electrons, not molecules, because his shareholders' obscene wealth depends on it.

SEC set to vote on corporate climate disclosures</h3><p><strong></strong>The Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to issue a long-awaited, final rule today on what climate-related disclosures public companies have to make to their investors. The rules will cover a company’s greenhouse gas emissions and its exposure to climate-related risks, like extreme weather or future regulations. The SEC’s initial proposal has been the center of a lobbying firestorm. The most contentious aspect asked companies to disclose emissions indirectly related to their business, known as “scope 3” emissions. As <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=fb528fca8c&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Heatmap</em>’s Emily Pontecorvo explained</a>: “That means a company like Amazon wouldn’t just have to report the emissions from its warehouses and delivery trucks, but also an estimate of the emissions associated with producing and using all the products it sells.”<br/><br/>Lobbying groups pushed back hard on this, and probably won: The SEC is <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=26c189205d&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expected</a> to drop requirements to report scope 3 emissions in the final rule. But it is also <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=01511aa2b8&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reportedly</a> going to soften rules for disclosing scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, which are greenhouse gases produced directly by the company through its own operations, and through its electricity use, respectively. “The draft rule now under consideration would compel such disclosures only if companies deem they are material,” <em>Reuters</em> reported.</p><h3>2. Solar accounted for more than half of new electric generating capacity last year </h3><p><strong></strong>Solar installations in America hit a record-high last year, according to the <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=7f326b2ee6&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S. Solar Market Insight 2023 Year in Review</a>. The industry added 32.4 gigawatts of electric generating capacity, which is a 51% increase over 2022. Solar accounted for more than half (53%) of all new electric generating capacity, a first for renewable electricity. “If we stay the course with our federal clean energy policies, total solar deployment will quadruple over the next 10 years,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. The report outlines solar deployment forecasts through 2034 based on different scenarios. Supply chain improvements, lower interest rates, and tax credits could increase installations; supply chain problems and unfavorable economic policies would hurt capacity:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">SEIA</small></p><h3>3. El Niño is weakening, WMO says</h3><p><strong></strong>The El Niño weather pattern that has been in place since June of last year peaked in December and is now weakening, the World Meteorological Organization <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=93e567c0c4&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> yesterday. But its warming effects will linger, resulting in above normal temperatures over nearly all land areas through May. “Every month since June 2023 has set a new monthly temperature record – and 2023 was by far the warmest year on record,” said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo. “El Niño has contributed to these record temperatures, but heat-trapping greenhouse gases are unequivocally the main culprit.” She continued: “Ocean surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific clearly reflect El Niño. But sea surface temperatures in other parts of the globe have been persistently and unusually high for the past 10 months. The January 2024 sea-surface temperature was by far the highest on record for January. This is worrying and can not be explained by El Niño alone.”</p><h3>4. Study: Arctic could see ice-free summer by 2035</h3><p><strong></strong>New <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=b6e2c13bdf&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research</a> published in the journal<em> Nature Reviews Earth & Environment</em> suggests the Arctic could be ice-free during the summer months as soon as 2035 due to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. “This would transform the Arctic into a completely different environment, from a white summer Arctic to a blue Arctic,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=57c0a13b54&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Alexandra Jahn, an associate professor of atmospheric and oceanic sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder and a lead author of the research. “So even if ice-free conditions are unavoidable, we still need to keep our emissions as low as possible to avoid prolonged ice-free conditions.” But she <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=2a63a530d3&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">added</a> that if, in the future, we are able to remove large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and reverse warming, “sea ice will come back within a decade.”</p><h3>5. Not-so-windy Florida moves to ban offshore wind farms</h3><p><strong></strong>Florida seems very keen on banning things that don’t yet exist. Earlier this week the state Senate approved a bill making it illegal to <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=1faa552934&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">manufacture or sell lab-grown meat</a>, a product that is still in early stages of development and pretty hard (though not impossible) to find. Now the state legislature is <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=13cd9db840&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about to pass HB 1645</a>, a bill prohibiting offshore wind turbines in state waters. Florida doesn’t have very strong offshore winds, and hurricanes pose a big risk to turbines, which explains why the state has not a single operational wind farm – offshore or onshore. And legislators want to keep it that way! Joking aside, the rest of the bill is less benign: It would ban transmission cabling in state waters, weaken regulations on natural gas pipelines, and delete most <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=1697a91a34&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">references to climate change</a> in state law.</p><h3>THE KICKER</h3><p>The state of Illinois has the <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=06c0756081&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">busiest</a> EV chargers in the U.S., with one <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=659860221c&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> finding the chargers are in use 26% of the time.</p>

## Does Rooftop Solar Actually Help the Climate?

date: 2024-03-06, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTYzNjQ3OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1OTUzNzM2N30.P5_1B8na1wA7_6QZgq_JIIn5z250AGwZVAbggW08TGA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	For a few weeks now, Heatmap’s staff writer, Emily Pontecorvo, has been trying to figure out if installing rooftop solar panels on your home actually reduces carbon pollution in a systematic way. In other words: If you own a home, and install solar panels on it, are you doing anything to change how much fossil fuel gets burned in your region or around the world? Or — somewhat counterintuitively — will your panels just increase the cost of electricity near you while shifting demand for those fossil fuels around?
</p><p>
	On this week’s episode, we try to answer these questions in a satisfying way. Princeton Professor Jesse Jenkins and I welcome Emily to the podcast to discuss the messy truth of distributed solar power.

</iframe>
</p></center><p>
	Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Emily Pontecorvo: </strong>My question is, if you're taking this solar-shaped hole out of electricity demand and that's displacing a cheaper utility-scale solar project, how do we go from that to you're not having an effect on emissions? Why is displacing that cheaper option than meaning that it's not as an effective climate action?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>Well, because basically there's a certain amount of demand for solar-shaped production in the electricity system, right? And if you're reducing demand for electricity at exactly the time that a utility solar project would produce, then you're making the economics of building more solar incrementally worse as you add more distributed solar.<br/>
<br/>
	We still get basically the same amount of overall solar power in equilibrium. Like, you know, that's the amount that's profitable for people to invest in. It's just that you've shifted it from, again, cheaper projects at larger scale to more expensive projects at smaller scale, particularly in the U.S. We can come back to why the U.S. market is so, I think, broken and so much more expensive than it needs to be. 
	<br/>
<br/>
	But particularly in the US, it is much more expensive, like three or four times more expensive, to build a megawatt worth of solar panels in 10 kilowatt increments at a bunch of different homes than it is to build one megawatt of solar on a big landfill or in a farm or on a big box store.
	<br/>
<strong><br/>
	Pontecorvo
	</strong>: So is the idea that, do you get less solar overall or is it? <br/>
<strong><br/>
	Jenkins
	</strong>: No, you basically get the same amount. You just get the same amount of solar and it's just more expensive. <br/>
<strong><br/>
	Pontecorvo
	</strong>: Why does it matter then? I mean, obviously it matters. It's a better outcome to have a cheaper clean electricity system. But ...<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jenkins</strong>: No, it's a great question. <br/>
<br/>
	So why does it matter? I mean, there's two questions. 
	<br/>
<br/>
	You were asking before, like, does it amount to an effective climate action? Well, if it doesn't increase the overall supply of solar power in the regional grid, then no, it's not an effective climate action.
	<br/>
<br/>
	It might be fine for you to do it as a personal decision for other reasons like economics or feeling like you don't want to keep paying your utility because you don't like the utility and you want to generate your own power. Like there's lots of other reasons why you might do this. Or because you want to save land, right? We can talk about the sort of land-saving potential distributed generation, which I think is probably the best case for it.
	<br/>
<br/>
	But in terms of climate impact, it's null. If you're not increasing the supply of clean energy overall, you're just substituting one clean megawatt hour for another clean megawatt hour.
	<br/>
<br/>
	Why does it matter that we're making that megawatt hour more expensive? Well, at the end of the day, we have to keep our electricity supply affordable as we decarbonize. Both because it's important for equity reasons, because we don't want people who have a hard time paying their bills to have to pay a lot more. But from a climate perspective, because we have to radically expand the amount of electricity supply and decarbonize transportation and heating and industry and make hydrogen and do all these other things, that are going to require electricity to be relatively competitive against the fossil fuels that they're trying to displace in those sectors.</blockquote><div class="horizontal-rule"></div><p>

## March 5, 2024 (Tuesday)

date: 2024-03-06, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

Possibly the biggest story today in terms of its impact on most Americans&#8217; lives is that as part of its war on junk fees, the Biden administration announced an $8 cap on late fees charged by credit card issuers that have more than a million accounts. These companies hold more than 95% of outstanding credit card debt. Currently, fees average $32, and they fall on more than 45 million people. The White House estimates that late fees currently cost Americans about $25 billion a year. The rule change will save Americans about $10 billion a year.

## US Lawmakers Push for ByteDance to Divest TikTok or Face Ban

date: 2024-03-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers introduced legislation on Tuesday to give China's ByteDance about six months to divest popular short video app TikTok or face a U.S. ban, seeking to tackle national security concerns about its Chinese ownership.


The bill is the first significant legislative move in nearly a year toward banning or forcing ByteDance to divest the popular app, after Senate legislation to ban it stalled in Congress last year in the face of heavy lobbying by TikTok.


Mike Gallagher, the Republican chairperson of the House of Representatives' select China committee and Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat, are among more than a dozen lawmakers introducing the measure, which is expected to see an initial vote on Thursday.


"This is my message to TikTok: break up with the Chinese Communist Party or lose access to your American users," Gallagher said. "America’s foremost adversary has no business controlling a dominant media platform in the United States."


The bill would give ByteDance 165 days to divest TikTok, which is used by more than 170 million Americans, or make it unlawful for app stores run by Apple, Google, and others to offer TikTok or provide web hosting services to apps controlled by ByteDance.


The bill would not authorize any enforcement against individual users of an affected app, however.


"This bill is an outright ban of TikTok, no matter how much the authors try to disguise it," a company spokesperson said on Tuesday.


"This legislation will trample the First Amendment rights of 170 million Americans and deprive 5 million small businesses of a platform they rely on to grow and create jobs," the spokesperson said.


A White House National Security Council spokesperson called the bill "an important and welcome step" adding that the Biden administration would work with Congress "to further strengthen this legislation and put it on the strongest possible legal footing."


The administration has worked with lawmakers from both parties to counter threats of tech services operating in the United States that pose risks to Americans’ sensitive data and broader national security, the official added.


TikTok says it has not, and would not, share U.S. user data with the Chinese government.


The American Civil Liberties Union called the bill unconstitutional, saying lawmakers were "once again attempting to trade our First Amendment rights for cheap political points during an election year."


The bill, which would require companion legislation in the Senate, will be considered at an Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on Thursday for a vote.


The popularity of the app could make it tough to get legislation approved in an election year. Last month, Democratic President Joe Biden's re-election campaign joined TikTok.


The bill would give the president new powers to designate apps of concern posing national security risks and subject them to the risk of bans or curbs unless ownership was divested.


It would cover apps with more than a million annual active users and under control of a foreign adversary entity, the bill says.


Concerns about Chinese-owned TikTok sparked efforts in Congress last year to tackle the risks from the short video sharing app or potentially ban it. Late in 2022, Congress barred federal employees from using it on government devices.


Last year the administration backed legislation sponsored by Senator Mark Warner and more than two dozen senators to give it new powers to ban TikTok and other foreign-based technologies if they pose national security threats.


That bill has never been voted on.


The new bill aims at bolstering the legal authority to address TikTok concerns. U.S. courts blocked an effort by previous President Donald Trump to ban TikTok in 2020.


Late in November, a U.S. judge blocked Montana's first-of-its kind state ban on TikTok, saying it violated users' free speech rights.

## US Stops Short of Congratulating Indonesia's Prabowo Subianto on Apparent Election Victory

date: 2024-03-06, from: VOA News USA

The White House says it looks forward to working with the new Indonesian administration but stopped short of congratulating Prabowo Subianto on his apparent victory in Indonesia’s presidential election last month. Prabowo, for his part, has vowed to continue a policy that allows Jakarta to reap Chinese investments while maintaining security ties with Washington.

## US Stops Short of Congratulating Indonesia's Prabowo on Apparent Election Victory

date: 2024-03-06, from: VOA News USA

white house — The White House said it looks forward to working with the incoming Indonesian administration but stopped short of congratulating Prabowo Subianto on his apparent victory in Indonesia’s presidential election last month.


“We congratulate the Indonesian people on a successful election. The president looks forward to early engagement with the new administration and strengthening our cooperation on what is already a strategic partnership,” said John Kirby, White House National Security Council spokesperson, in response to VOA’s question during the White House briefing Tuesday.


Kirby said the administration is “closely following the ongoing vote count” that shows Prabowo commanding a significant lead. With almost 90% of the votes counted, Prabowo holds almost 59% of the more than 150 million votes in the February 14 election.


“We've had an excellent cooperation with him since the time he was defense minister, and if he is in fact finally elected, then we look forward to continuing that relationship,” Kirby said.


Official results are not due until later in March, but Prabowo has claimed victory, and several countries have extended their congratulations, including China, Australia, the United Kingdom and others.




Alleged human rights violation


Currently serving as Indonesia’s defense minister, Prabowo has a long track record of alleged human rights violations, including the abduction and torture of activists during the 1998 ouster of his then father-in-law, former President Suharto, who ruled Indonesia for 32 years.


Prabowo’s victory is widely attributed to the support of the popular outgoing president, Joko Widodo, who last week awarded Prabowo with an honorary four-star general rank. The president’s son, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, is Prabowo’s running mate, fueling accusations of nepotism.


“Prabowo’s election creates not only a bad precedent in the effort to prosecute state crimes committed by the previous government,” said Gufron Mabruri, executive director of Indonesian human rights group Imparsial. “It will also weaken enforcement of human rights in the future.”


Until 2020, Prabowo was banned from entering the U.S. due to alleged human rights violations, but he has since visited as defense minister, invited by both the Trump and Biden administrations.


Asked about potential democratic backsliding in Indonesia, Kirby said the administration will “never back away from our concerns about the need for human rights, civil rights, and all the values of democratic institutions,” and that President Joe Biden “absolutely will not shy away” about expressing such concerns.


As the United States and China compete for regional influence, Prabowo aims to continue Indonesia’s nonaligned foreign policy that has allowed Jakarta to reap massive investments from Beijing while maintaining security ties with Washington.


In Washington, concerns about Indonesia veering too close to Beijing provide a geostrategic backdrop to U.S.-Indonesia ties, said Andreyka Natalegawa, associate fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.


“At the same time, these broader geopolitical factors are also just strengthened by the fact that the U.S.-Indonesia partnership is strong and solid,” Natalegawa told VOA. He added that given the continuities with the outgoing Indonesian government, Washington should be comfortable in working with the new incoming administration.


There have been sporadic protests in Jakarta alleging election interference, but official results are expected to declare Prabowo as the country’s next leader in the coming weeks.


VOA Indonesia's Rivan Dwiastono contributed to this report.

## DOAJ and Crossref renew their partnership to support the least-resourced journals

date: 2024-03-06, from: Crossref Blog

<p>Crossref and DOAJ share the aim to encourage the dissemination and use of scholarly research using online technologies and to work with and through regional and international networks, partners, and user communities for the achievement of their aims to build local institutional capacity and sustainability.
Both organisations agreed to work together in 2021 in a variety of ways, but primarily to ‘encourage the dissemination and use of scholarly research using online technologies, and regional and international networks, partners and communities, helping to build local institutional capacity and sustainability around the world.’ Some of the fruits of this labour are:</p>
<ul>
<li>DOAJ added support for Crossref XML to make it easier for publishers to upload metadata</li>
<li>Closer collaboration between customer/member support at both organisations, making it easier for publishers and journal editors to navigate both service’s technologies</li>
<li>the launch of PLACE: ‘a ‘one-stop shop’ for information to support publishers in adopting best practices the industry developed’ (together with other partners)</li>
<li>a pilot gap analysis of the journals in DOAJ with the possibility of helping them start to use and resolve DOIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The new agreement, signed earlier this month, will slightly shift focus to build upon existing collaborations, particularly around metadata. One of the primary sections of the MOU is enhancing support for the least-resourced journals by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assigning DOIs and depositing the metadata with Crossref
*Finding ways to improve their DOAJ application experience to help them become indexed</li>
<li>Collect and ingest their Crossref metadata into DOAJ</li>
<li>Help them to get preserved via JASPER or similar initiatives</li>
<li>Help identify other local partners, such as Crossref Sponsoring Organisations, to support their use of Crossref services</li>
</ul>
<div class="quotecite">
<blockquote>
<p>It’s great that we can further underpin what is already a good working relationship. Both Crossref and DOAJ are central to discovery so it’s a natural partnership. Helping journals meet better standards and become indexed to make them more discoverable on a global scale is at the heart of our strategy. This agreement opens up a new avenue that allows the community to really focus on supporting those journals and the research they publish.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>&ndash; Joanna Ball, Managing Director of DOAJ</cite></p>
</div>
<div class="quotecite">
<blockquote>
<p>‘The collaborations with DOAJ so far only reconfirmed our shared goal to help make the global scholarly communications system more equitable wherever we can. Our joint projects aim to seek out and devise support for resource-constrained journals in multiple ways. DOAJ’s work is essential in helping journals to develop good practice, while Crossref offers an open infrastructure to ensure all journals can be included and discoverable in the global scholarly record.’</p>
