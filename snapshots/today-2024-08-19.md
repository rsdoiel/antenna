## Short book note: Moerdijk and van Oosten, Sets, Models and Proofs

date: 2024-08-19, from: Logic Matters blog

<p>Back (slowly, slowly) to logical matters. My plan for the rest of the year is to put together a second edition of what is consistently the most downloaded of the Big Red Logic Books (and also, surprisingly, the second-best paperback seller), namely Beginning Mathematical Logic: A Study Guide. It won&#8217;t be a radical revision, though [&#8230;]</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.logicmatters.net/2024/08/19/short-book-note-moerdijk-and-van-oosten-sets-models-and-proofs/">Short book note: Moerdijk and van Oosten, &lt;i&gt;Sets, Models and Proofs&lt;/i&gt;</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.logicmatters.net">Logic Matters</a>.</p>

## Don’t Mess With Texas Heat

date: 2024-08-19, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzE3NjAwMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyOTkxOTQ0NX0.YEB3QI9agNQFctKJG4UghBCuWnklNFhCGMwZeCyp2Cw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">The heat is chilling out this week, meaning today’s update is a short one. If you’re in the Northeast, start dreaming of pumpkins and hot cocoa. If you live farther south … keep running that AC a little longer. </p>
<h3>Fall is in sight — for some </h3>
<p>Those in the Northeast can start airing out their sweaters this week. According to Paul Pastelok, AccuWeather senior meteorologist, a long-lasting jet stream should bring temperatures 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit below historical averages through the end of August. The region can also expect some precipitation and stronger storms, which will likely bring down temperatures even more. </p>
<p>The Pacific Northwest will also get fall-like weather this week, Pastelok told me, which will move into the Great Lakes and the Ohio Valley on Thursday. <strong>For much of the South and the Gulf Coast, however, forecasts are not looking as optimistic. </strong>Pastelok told me it’s possible that both Albuquerque, New Mexico and Lubbock, Texas will break heat records this week, getting well into the 90s and 100s, respectively. </p>
<p>After a brief respite, the heat will also return to the western Dakotas, Nebraska, Wyoming, and southeast Montana. Some parts of the Pacific Northwest that started the week feeling fall-ish might end it back in summer, as temperatures creep back up on the eastern side of the region. By Friday, Texas will have it worst.</p><h3>Park Fire slows down </h3>
<p><strong>The Park Fire seems to have finally halted </strong>— it hasn’t grown past 429,000 acres burned since last week. Containment is now at 53%. and no new counties have been affected.<strong> “I think there's a reasonable chance that the fire has largely reached its final footprint,” </strong>said Climate scientist of the University of California, Los Angeles Daniel Swain during a live briefing on Friday. </p>
<p>After experiencing its hottest July ever, California will finally get a break from the heat this week as the low pressure along the northwest coast will send cool air down into California, Pastelok told me. “The combination of smoke and westerly winds will cool northern California, as well as the coastal areas down to southern California,” he said. </p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean fire conditions are going away, Swain explained. As long as things stay windy and dry, the risk will remain, and a new heat wave arriving around the end of August could up the danger even higher. </p>
<h3>Greece’s worst wildfire of the year almost reached Athens </h3>
<p>Gigantic wildfires in Greece stopped just shy of Athens. The fire spread incredibly quickly last week due to powerful winds, with flames as high as 80 feet — the mayor of Kifisia, Vasilis Xypolitas, told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/13/europe/greece-athens-wildfires-evacuation-residents-intl/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>CNN</u></a> that at one point, the fire was moving faster than cars. Thousands of residents had to be evacuated. </p>
<p>While the flames have since died down, they burned through almost 260,000 acres, causing extensive damage to cities and villages. Houses, schools, and hospitals have been completely destroyed and many residents might have to wait weeks before electricity is restored. One death has been confirmed. </p>
<p>The cause of the fire has not yet been determined, but Greece has been suffering through a particularly hot and dry summer — prime conditions for relentless fires. This year, the country saw its hottest June and July on record. </p>
<h3>Another heat wave in the Balkans </h3>
<p>Southeastern Europe has recently seen temperatures above 100 degrees during a heat wave that is expected to persist this week. This is the latest heat wave to hit Romania, which has already suffered through drought and extreme weather this summer. While some rain is predicted for the country this week, temperatures will continue to run above average</p><p>Bosnia has also been particularly hard hit, and farmers there have noticed a significant impact to production this year. Around Bijeljina, where most of the country’s grain production takes place, <strong>farmers estimate that half their crops have been damaged due to the heat</strong>. The whole country has seen little to no precipitation this summer, with temperatures constantly above 95 degrees.</p>

## Manufacturing Is Back, Baby

date: 2024-08-19, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzM3NjgwNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MjgzODMyNH0.gi87Rz_JsMGURxPIa65orwz5IPQLzJkU9NCRNt_m1wA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	For my entire life, I’ve heard politicians talk about bringing manufacturing jobs back to America. Now it is 
	<em><em>finally</em></em> happening. “We’re not going back!” has become Kamala Harris’s <a href="https://x.com/KamalaHarris" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rallying cry</u></a>, and it’s apt here too, because those jobs and industries of the future are what’s at stake in this election.
</p>
<p>
	The Biden-Harris administration and the 117th Congress enacted a trio of laws — the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, otherwise known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law — that made major public investments to cultivate and strengthen several key industries of the future: semiconductors, electric vehicles, batteries, solar and wind manufacturing, hydrogen-based energy, and clean steel.
</p>
<p>
	Those new laws (and other Biden-Harris Administration actions on trade and tariffs) have directed and amplified a megatrend in “reshoring” and driven a huge surge in private sector investments in U.S. manufacturing, creating tens of thousands of good jobs in communities across America. Investment in manufacturing construction has 
	<a href="https://x.com/JesseJenkins/status/1823811245868507216" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more than doubled</u></a> since passage of the IRA and CHIPS, and the U.S. has seen nearly <a href="https://www.jackconness.com/ira-chips-investments" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>127,000 new jobs created</u></a>, according to Energy Innovation policy analyst Jack Conness.
</p>
<center>
<iframe aria-label="Interactive line chart" data-external="1" frameborder="0" height="448" id="datawrapper-chart-z3LSr" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/z3LSr/2/" style="border: none;" title="Total Construction Spending on Manufacturing in the U.S." width="680"></iframe>
</center>
<p>
	Just last week, on the occasion of the IRA’s two-year anniversary, Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo wrote about a new report finding that 6,285 utility-scale clean energy projects in the U.S. may be eligible for IRA tax credits, meaning 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/ira-anniversary-labor" target="_self"><u>3.9 million jobs</u></a>, all of which will be subject to minimum pay standards if they want the federal rewards.
</p>
<p>
	These investments are supporting a diverse set of communities across America. Of the nearly $71 billion of clean energy manufacturing investments announced in 2023, 
	<a href="https://cleaneconomytracker.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more than $59 billion</u></a> — around 83% — were in House districts represented by Republicans per the <a href="https://cleaneconomytracker.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Clean Economy Tracker</u></a>, a partnership between Atlas Public Policy and Utah State University. That’s tens of billions of dollars flowing into rural areas, including a significant chunk going to “energy communities,” areas that have historically produced, processed, or transported fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
	We all know that manufacturing plants can be an anchor employer for a community and play an even more important role than the direct jobs numbers reveal. The opening of dozens of new advanced manufacturing plants means dozens of communities across America have a brighter economic future —
	<strong> </strong>or at least, they do for now.

<p>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>Project 2025</u></a>, the Heritage Foundation’s vision for “the next conservative administration,” contains a set of plans and policies that would put all those communities and hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs in jeopardy. Energy Innovation <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/The-Second-Half-of-The-Decisive-Decade-Potential-U.S.-Pathways-on-Climate-Jobs-and-Health.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>modeled</u></a> the policy scenario outlined in Project 2025 against one in which the U.S. meets its stated goal of reducing emissions 50% to 52% below 2005 levels by 2030 and found that the former would lead to <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Change-in-jobs-Project-2025-v-Continued-Climate-Leadership.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>3.9 million fewer jobs</u></a> in 2030 compared to the latter, including 1.7 million jobs straight-up lost. The overall economic effect would be catastrophic: a <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Change-in-GDP-Project-2025-v-Continued-Climate-Leadership.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$320 billion annual drop</u></a> in GDP in 2030, compared to a $450 billion per year gain if the U.S. meets its clean energy and climate goals.
</p>
<p>
	Trump has publicly disavowed Project 2025, but the evidence for his private alignment with its authors and principles continues to mount — most recently the release of 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR8e1IJgZSM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>secret Project 2025 training videos</u></a>, featuring more than two-dozen former Trump administration figures.
</p>
<p>
	Project 2025 calls for gutting the IRA and the infrastructure law, which would, in the words of a 
	<a href="https://www.thirdway.org/memo/american-manufacturing-is-making-a-comeback-a-second-trump-term-would-send-it-packing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>memo released</u></a> last week by the center-left think tank Third Way, “end crucial federal investments in US manufacturing, scrap tax incentives that help U.S. manufacturers compete with China, and make it harder for U.S. manufacturers to obtain loans.” It would also have ominous implications for America’s geopolitical position in the medium- to long-term. “Funding basic research and then cutting all subsequent support, as Trump plans to do, opens the door for other countries to swoop in and claim market share,” the authors write. This has happened before: The U.S. developed much of the solar and battery technology China is now using to dominate those global markets.
</p>
<p>
	That’s to say nothing of the overall environment of chaos and policy uncertainty that comes with a Trump presidency, which wreaks havoc on business investment. Business leaders would be wise to remember 
	<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/09/05/trump-obama-economy/#:~:text=15.%20Business%20investment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>what it was like</u></a> under Trump 1.0. Trump might promise corporate tax cuts, but with a strong economy, cooling inflation, and a vibrant manufacturing renaissance finally underway, the worst thing we could do is pull the rug out from under the entire U.S. economic policy framework — continuity and certainty are good for business.
</p>
<p>
	As Greg Sargent 
	<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/184855/trump-weird-nuclear-moment-elon-musk-kamala-opening" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pointed out</u></a> in <em><em>The New Republic,</em></em> “All this gives Harris an opening.” The green transition can be exciting, a source of the kind of joy Harris and her vice presidential nominee, Tim Walz, have been <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/09/nx-s1-5060012/kamala-harris-tim-walz-campaign-democrats" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>stumping about</u></a>. “Without getting entangled in cultural cross-signaling around fossil fuels, she can argue that the very last thing we should do is reverse the clean energy boom. It’s creating lots of jobs building cool, innovative stuff right in the American heartland.”
</p>
<p>
	I, for one, will be looking to see if this contrast starts to show up in political ads and speeches at this week’s Democratic National Convention — something like: “Harris will continue investing in U.S. manufacturing and the industries of the future. Trump will blow that all up. The choice is on the ballot. And we’re not going back.”
</p>
<p>
	What future do you choose?

BTW, it's nice to see the DNC <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/the-democratic-national-convention-is-giving-influencers-media-credentials-for-the-first-time-why-both-campaigns-are-pivoting-to-social-first-strategies-110059052.html">including influencers</a> this year. I hear them say this is the first time, but I beg to disagree. A few dozen bloggers were <a href="http://scripting.com/2004/07/07.html">at the DNC in 2004</a>, and were treated well, in many ways. I think the word influencer and blogger have fairly similar meanings. Blogger is a broader term, because it's possible to have a very small readership for a blog, thus not be influencing very much, but still have a lot of value. And you always can influence your mom and little sister, right? <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

## The hottest invite in American economics

date: 2024-08-19, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Picture this: Lush greenery, the picturesque Tetons and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in a cowboy hat. (Maybe.) This week, roughly 120 academics, Fed policy makers and journalists are descending on Wyoming for the annual Jackson Hole Symposium. We&#8217;ll hear more about the event combining mountain hikes and monetary policy. But first, inflation remains a raw nerve as Vice President Kamala Harris begins to outline her economic policy goals.</p>

## Reliable app storage over time is not here yet

date: 2024-08-19, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I'm working on a project which may or may not ship, but it presents an interesting design challenge either way.</p>
<p>The idea is I want to write lots of little bits, less than 5000 characters each, they have titles, use styling, links, include images, etc. </p>
<p>Or it could also be as small as a single emoji.</p>
<p>This is what we've settled on in 2024 as the basic unit of writing. From a tweet to a long blog post. </p>
<p>I want to make an editor and storage system that fits this model perfectly based on all we know about this stuff, and the latest server and network technologies. </p>
<p>It should have the best simplest API we know how to make in 2024.</p>
<p>In every way it'll be the nicest, fastest and most flexible way to create structures of writing over time.</p>
<p>In that last sentence is the gotcha -- <i>over time. </i>It's the frontier, the leading edge. Because in 2024 there's no way for me, as an individual developer to create a structure that lasts over time.  </p>
<p>I can create a structure that has a high probability of lasting a month. A pretty good chance of lasting a few years, but beyond that, it gets less likely probably at a pretty good clip and eventually goes over a cliff. </p>
<p>The way I have answered that in the past was with GitHub.</p>
<p>In 2017, I started an <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog">archive</a> of my <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a> writing on GitHub. It's still just a fraction of my writing, I'm not doing anything like that for all my other sites and services. But at least I've managed to set up a system that only requires me to do something once a month, which is something I like to do because it gives me some assurance the other mechanisms are still working. Archive systems have bugs too.</p>
<p>So I guess for the project I'm doing I will again use GitHub to mirror the content in the database until and unless GitHub proves unusable for this purpose, or something much better comes along.  </p>

## Feeds for Threads

date: 2024-08-19, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I was <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kvell">kvelling</a> the other day <a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C-wOWuDJUU6">about rss.app</a> and how they have feeds for <a href="https://www.threads.net/">Threads</a> accounts. They do. But there are two caveats.</p>
<ol>
<li>It <a href="https://rss.app/pricing">costs</a> $9.99 per month for 15 feeds. Could be a bit expensive for some people's budgets.</li>
<li><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2023/07/02/validRss.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">The second concern is more serious. It doesn't handle titleless items properly. It repeats the contents of the tweet in the title and description of the feeds it generates. An <a href="https://feeder.scripting.com/returnjson?feedurl=https://rss.app/feeds/3A2qGRnWMHFk5DvE.xml">example</a>. This is not right, and it's not the way Mastodon and Bluesky do it. There's nothing wrong with items that have no titles. When an item has no title you do the common sense thing -- omit the title. I'm happy to help with this. I wrote the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS 2.0 spec</a>, and am something of an authority on this. It's important to get this right.</li>

## Fed's pandemic-era vow to prioritize employment may soon be tested

date: 2024-08-19, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Four years after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made fighting unemployment a bigger priority during the COVID-19 pandemic, he faces a pivotal test of that commitment amid rising joblessness, mounting evidence inflation is under control, and a benchmark interest rate that is still the highest in a quarter of a century.   


High interest rates may be on the way out, with the U.S. central bank expected to deliver a first cut at its Sept. 17-18 meeting and Powell potentially providing more information about the approach to the policy easing in a speech on Friday at the Kansas City Fed's annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.   


But with the Fed's policy rate in the 5.25%-5.50% range for more than a year, the impact of relatively high borrowing costs on the economy may still be building and could take time to unwind even if the central bank starts cutting — a dynamic that could put hopes for a "soft landing" of controlled inflation alongside continued low unemployment at risk.   


"Powell says the labor market is normalizing," with wage growth easing, job openings still healthy, and unemployment around what policymakers see as consistent with inflation at the central bank's 2% target, former Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said. "That would be great if that is all there is. The history is not good."   


Indeed, increases in the unemployment rate like those seen in recent months are typically followed by more.   


"That does not seem the situation now. But you may only be one or two poor employment reports away" from needing aggressive rate cuts to counter rising joblessness, Evans said. "The longer you wait, the actual adjustment becomes harder to make." 


Inflation versus employment  


Evans was a key voice in reframing the Fed's policy approach, unveiled by Powell at Jackson Hole in August 2020 as the pandemic was raging, policymakers were gathering via video feed, and the unemployment rate was 8.4%, down from 14.8% that April.   


In that context the Fed's shift seemed logical, changing a long-standing bias towards heading off inflation at the expense of what policymakers came to view as an unnecessary cost to the job market.   


Standard monetary policymaking saw inflation and unemployment inextricably and inversely linked: Unemployment below a certain point stoked wages and prices; weak inflation signaled a moribund job market. Officials began to rethink that connection after the 2007-2009 recession, concluding they needn't treat low unemployment as an inflation risk in itself.   


As a matter of equity for those at the job market's margins, and to achieve the best outcomes overall, the new strategy said Fed policy would "be informed by assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level."   


"This change may appear subtle," Powell said in his 2020 speech to the conference. "But it reflects our view that a robust job market can be sustained without causing an outbreak of inflation."   


A pandemic-driven inflation surge and dramatic employment recovery made that change seem irrelevant: The Fed had to raise rates to tame inflation, and until recently the pace of price increases had slowed without much apparent damage to the job market. The unemployment rate through April had been below 4% for more than two years, an unparalleled streak not seen since the 1960s. The unemployment rate since 1948 has averaged 5.7%.   


But the events of the last two years, and a coming Fed strategy review, have also triggered a wave of research into exactly what happened: why inflation fell, what role policy played in that, and how things might be done differently if inflation risks rise again.   


While the agenda for this year's conference remains under wraps, the broad theme focuses on how monetary policy influences the economy. That bears on how officials may evaluate future choices and tradeoffs and the wisdom of tactics like preempting inflation before it starts.   


Some of that work is already emerging from Fed researchers, including top economist Michael Kiley. He has authored a paper questioning whether policy "asymmetry" — treating employment shortfalls differently than a tight labor market, for example — really helps. Another recent paper suggested policymakers who believe public inflation expectations are formed in the short-run and are volatile should react sooner and raise rates higher in response.   


The role public expectations play in driving inflation — and the policy response - was on full display in 2022. When it appeared expectations risked moving higher, the Fed pushed its tightening cycle into overdrive with 75-basis-point hikes at four consecutive meetings. Powell then used a truncated Jackson Hole speech to emphasize his commitment to fight inflation —a stark shift from his jobs-first commentary two years earlier.   


It was a key moment that put the U.S. central bank's seriousness on display, underpinned its credibility with the public and markets, and rebuilt some of the standing that preemptive policies had lost.   


'Too tight' 


Powell now faces a test in the other direction. Inflation is progressing back to 2%, but the unemployment rate has risen to 4.3%, up eight-tenths of a percentage point from July 2023.   


There's debate over what that really says about the labor market versus rising labor supply, a positive thing if new job seekers find employment.   


But it did breach a rule-of-thumb recession indicator, and while that has been downplayed given other indicators of a growing economy, it also is slightly above the 4.2% that Fed officials regard as representing full employment.   


It's also higher than at any point in Powell's pre-pandemic months as Fed chief: It was 4.1% and falling when he took over in February 2018.   


The "shortfall" in employment that he promised to respond to four years ago, in other words, may already be taking shape.   


While Powell will be reluctant to ever declare victory over inflation for fear of touching off exuberant overreaction, Ed Al-Hussainy, senior global rates strategist at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, said it was past time for the Fed to get in front of the risk to unemployment - preemption of a different sort.   


Al-Hussainy said the Fed had proved its ability to keep public expectations about inflation in check, an important asset, but that "also has put in motion some downside risk to employment."   


"The policy stance today is offside — it is too tight — and that warrants acting on."

## 2024-08-18 Indie search for Oddmu

date: 2024-08-19, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-18-indie-search-for-oddmu">2024-08-18 Indie search for Oddmu</h1>

<p>This is a follow-up for <a href="2024-08-16-json-feed-for-indexes">2024-08-16 JSON feed for indexing</a> where I linked to <a href="https://www.byjp.me/posts/indiesearch/">IndieSearch, byJP</a>. I want to see what&rsquo;s required for this to work.</p>

<p>First, I need to install Pagefind. Lucky me, I already have a Rust build environment installed.</p>

<pre><code>cargo install pagefind
</code></pre>

<p>Next, I need a static HTML copy of my site:</p>

<pre><code>env ODDMU_LANGUAGES=de,en  oddmu static -jobs 3 /tmp/alex
</code></pre>

<p>Create the index:</p>

<pre><code>pagefind --site /tmp/alex
</code></pre>

<p>Upload:</p>

<pre><code>mv /tmp/alex/pagefind .
make upload
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s now available at <code>https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/pagefind</code>.</p>

<p>Adding the info to the page header:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;search&quot; type=&quot;application/pagefind&quot; href=&quot;/wiki/pagefind&quot; title=&quot;Alex Schroeder’s Diary&quot;&gt;
&lt;link href=&quot;/wiki/pagefind/pagefind-ui.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;/wiki/pagefind/pagefind-ui.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) =&gt; {
  new PagefindUI({ element: &quot;#pagefind&quot;, showSubResults: true });
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And a div to the page body:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=&quot;pagefind&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And I had to add <code>'unsafe-eval'</code> to the <code>script-src</code> Content-Security-Policy header.</p>

<p>Too bad the search result links all end in <code>.html</code> … that requires an extra rewrite rule, to get rid of. On the other hand, it also allowed me to get rid of <code>baseUrl: &quot;/view/&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>Since there are still rough edges, this search is only available via <a href="pagefind.html">Pagefind</a>. I&rsquo;m also not promising any updates to the index.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Search">#Search</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Oddµ">#Oddµ</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-08-19</strong>. While I was experimenting with this all, I asked <a class="account" href="https://hachyderm.io/@byjp" title="@byjp@hachyderm.io">@byjp</a> some questions.</p>

<p><em>Sites provide local indexes in the Pagefind format, as a static file?</em></p>

<p>Correct — except it’s many files, organised so as to allow minimal transfer for a single search query — but all can be retrieved to have a full local index</p>

<p><em>Clients register one or more of these files and allow searching them?</em></p>

<p>Correct — they can be retrieved/cached to query locally, or queried efficiently remotely.</p>

<p><em>Users can install a large number of them, locally? Like I have 23 local dictionaries installed for my dictd and I can query them, locally.</em></p>

<p>Yes. Many can be kept locally or remotely. The sites you “register”/add become your search index.</p>

<p><em>Is it possible for a website to offer just a Pagefind installation with a number of URLs to Pagefind indexes without hosting pages and indexes? Clients visiting this Pagefind installation would download all the indexes pointed to in the list and search them locally?</em></p>

<p>Yes (with minor hackery). Each Pagefind instance <em>is</em> the index, a small bootstrapping JS/WASM blob, and ~5 lines of init JS. Those 5 lines can include locations of multiple indexes for the (exclusively client-side) JS to query when searching; by default the only one configured is the “local” index that created with the Pagefind JS/WASM blob, but you could strip away an empty index and have what you describe — in fact, that’s what my <a href="https://www.byjp.me/posts/indiesearch/">IndieSearch</a> demo does!</p>

<p><em>If instead of visiting a site with a Pagefind installation one installs a Pagefind browser extensions, is it possible to point it to a URL that hosts a list of indexes?</em></p>

<p>I haven’t built that (yet), but yeah — I’d want to build an mf2/IndieWeb compatible “new user experience” that’d guide folks to finding a good-for-them set of defaults. My demo automatically (provisionally) adds any site you visit that supports IndieSearch, so you’d get better coverage fast. I’d also consider default-importing from blogrolls and the like. (Management &amp; performance gets tricky with 1000s of indexes. Probs an “if we get there” problem. 😅)</p>

<p><em>Is it possible to &ldquo;merge&rdquo; Pagefind indexes and pass those aggregates on? I&rsquo;m afraid that having local copies of the indexes means that clients will have to at least query thousands of sites for updates to their page indexes.</em></p>

<p>Not yet, but I asked exactly this question of the Pagefind devs and they offered that it’s currently too hard, but that there is a potential route they&rsquo;d consider, see <a href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/pagefind/discussions/564#discussioncomment-8702059">#564</a>.</p>

<p><em>Thank you so much for answering the questions!</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still thinking about the situation where I&rsquo;m part of a community and we want to all share search, like using <a href="https://lieu.cblgh.org/">Lieu</a> for a webring – except I&rsquo;d like a solution where I don&rsquo;t have to do the crawling.</p>

<p>Sadly, the communities I&rsquo;m part of are planets such as <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/">RPG Planet</a> or <a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/">Planet Emacslife</a>, each with hundreds of blogs. I suppose most of them don&rsquo;t offer a Pagefind index, being hosted on Blogspot and Wordpress, but what I&rsquo;m considering is ingesting their feed and indexing it. This could be a service I could perform for people. Luckily, it&rsquo;s often possible to get all the blog pages via the feed. This is how I&rsquo;ve made <a href="2010-05-31_Blognapping">local backups of other people&rsquo;s blogs</a>. I guess that each site would be a separate index, however?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to find a way that doesn&rsquo;t require me to always download all the pages. I&rsquo;d like to find a way to update the index as it&rsquo;s being used.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d need a way to figure out how to configure it such that the results link back to the original pages, of course.</p>

<p>Another thing I&rsquo;m considering is that my own site is rendered live, from Markdown files… it&rsquo;s not a static site. So ideally I&rsquo;d be able to ingest Markdown files directly. Or I can go the route of exporting it all into a big feed and ingesting that, once I&rsquo;ve solved the problem above, I guess. But the problem above might also be easier to solve by extracting HTML pages from the feed. It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done in the past. Create something that works, first, then improve it later?</p>

<p>Anyway, ideas are swirling around.</p>

<p><strong>2024-08-19</strong>. I notice more things that aren&rsquo;t quite working the way I like them to work.</p>

<p>The sort order of the results is less than ideal, for example. I like to emphasize more recent blog posts.
Pagefind, however, returns them in some sort of scoring order so that I&rsquo;ve seen quite a few results with pages around 20 years old.</p>

<p>Image previews seem to rarely work. I suspect the problem is pages in subfolders linking to images in that same subfolder. Such relative links don&rsquo;t need a path – but they do if Pagefind is not in the same directory.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another thing to consider: The index takes up more space than the full HTML of the entire site, compressed!</p>

<pre><code>alex@sibirocobombus ~&gt; du -sh alexschroeder.ch/wiki/pagefind alexschroeder.ch/wiki/feed.json.gz 
 43M	alexschroeder.ch/wiki/pagefind
9.7M	alexschroeder.ch/wiki/feed.json.gz
</code></pre>

<p>So the Pagefind index takes about 4× more space than the full HTML, for this site. This matches my experience with better indexing for my own site where I experimented with full text indexes and trigram indexes. Back then:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the 15 MiB of markdown files seem to have generated an index of 70 MiB – <a href="2023-09-11-oddmu">2023-09-11 Oddµ memory consumption</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, in terms of copyright incentives, handing off the entire site like that is tricky. Doing it with a feed feels OK. Doing it for a search engine seems like handing the keys to Google. This provides an incentive to use a pre-computed index.</p>

<p>It also reminds me that the idea I had of building a search engine out of feed slurping without consent is probably a bad idea – like all ideas based on non-consensual acts.</p>

<p>Whether self-indexing is a good thing in terms of avoiding an English-first focus I don&rsquo;t know. I suspect that most people will be using free software and therefore there&rsquo;s no reason to suspect that a search engine doesn&rsquo;t have the means to process the languages. Then again, that&rsquo;s a lock-in where in order to support a new language, you have to support the software your favourite search-engine supports. So people indexing our own pages might have long term benefits.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still wondering about the comparison of Pagefind and Lunr, to be honest. How many such static search solutions are there? Is there a benefit of one implementation over another?</p>

<p>I guess now I should look into Pagefind some more? Indexing non-HTML pages, handling image previews for pages not in the root directory and relative image source URLs, the sort order of results, the use of the .html extension in results… there are still rough edges as far as I am concerned – and per discussion above the onus is on me to fix my indexing. 😭</p>

## 2024-08-16 JSON feed for indexing

date: 2024-08-19, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-16-json-feed-for-indexing">2024-08-16 JSON feed for indexing</h1>

<p>Recently, <a class="account" href="https://toot.cat/@dredmorbius" title="@dredmorbius@toot.cat">@dredmorbius</a> wrote about Google and search and posed the question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What if websites indexed their own content, and published a permuted index in a standard format, in a cache-and-forward model similar to how DNS works?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A while ago I wondered about <a href="2023-03-07_A_vision_for_search">self-published indexes</a>. We have software to generate feeds. Why not software to generate indexes? Back then I proposed a JSON format. Today I finally took a look at <a href="https://www.jsonfeed.org/version/1.1/">JSON Feed</a>. I think it has everything we need.</p>

<p>Take a look at the example for this site: <a href="/.well-known/search-feed.json.gz">.well-known/search-feed.json.gz</a>.
This file has about 9.7MiB. The source material is 6740 Markdown pages, a total of about 21.5MiB, or 8.4MiB compressed.</p>

<p>Using the <code>next_url</code> attribute, it would be possible to split this file up into chunks of 100 pages each, or a chunk per year, if the platform promises that older pages never change. This wouldn&rsquo;t work for my wiki, but perhaps it would for certain platforms.</p>

<p>Somebody will have write up a best-practice on how to use HTTP headers to avoid downloading the whole file when nothing has changed. Sadly, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-13">section 13 of RFC 2616</a> is pretty convoluted. Basically something about the use of If-Modified-Since and ETags headers.</p>

<p>We also need to agree on how to use some of the JSON Feed attributes.</p>

<p><code>content_text</code>: If used, all markup should be ignored by the server (no guessing whether the text is Markdown or not). It would be fine if this contained just the text nodes of the HTML, separated by spaces. This can be useful to see whether words occur in the text, how frequent they are, etc.</p>

<p><code>content_html</code>: This is the preferred way to include pages in the index. It is up to the search engine provider to extract useful information from the HTML, including summaries, extracts, scoring, etc. It is up to index providers to provide the kind of HTML they think serves search engines best. This includes using the semantic HTML tags and dropping style, scripts, footers and other elements that might be used by search engines to reduce the relevance of the item.</p>

<p>I also find <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5005">RFC 5005</a> to be very instructive in how to think about feeds for archiving.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://neuromatch.social/@jonny" title="@jonny@neuromatch.social">@jonny</a> commented, saying that it was important to think about how search indexes were going to be used:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so given that no single machine would or should store a whole index of the internet or even all your local internet, you can go a few ways with that, take the global quorum sensing path and you get a bigass global dht-like thing like ipfs. if instead you think there should be some structure, then you need proximity. is that social proximity where we swap indexes between people we know? or webring like proximity dependent on pages linking to each other and mutually indexing their neighborhood?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting question but I think I want incremental improvements to the current situation. So if a person has a website right now, on server, what&rsquo;s the simplest thing they can do so that they aren&rsquo;t drowned in crawlers and can still be found via search? That would be publishing an index, analogous to publishing a feed. Having more search engines (even if using legacy centralized architecture) would be better than what we have now. Not depending on crawlers would be better what we have now.</p>

<p>In terms of decentralisation, I think I like community search engines like lieu. The idea is great: a community lists a bunch of sites. Lieu generates a web ring and crawls them to build an index of all the member sites. Instead of crawling, it could fetch the indexes. This would be much better than what it does right now, because right now, lieu uses colly for crawling and colly ignores robots.txt. This means that <a href="2024-06-22-lieu">lieu instantly bans itself when it visits my site</a> because it&rsquo;s not rate limited. It&rsquo;s just an implementation detail, but sadly I am biased. I&rsquo;ve been on a Butlerian Jihad since 2009 when I discover that <a href="2009-10-15_Network_Traffic">over 30% of all requests I serve from my sites are for machines, not humans</a>.</p>

<p>It makes me want to raise my keyboard and scream &ldquo;CO₂ for the CO₂ god!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Somebody should draw a Hacker Elric doing that, standing on a mountain of electro-trash with the burnt and dead landscape of the post-apocalypse in the background.</p>

<p>But back to the problem of indexing. Right now, search engine operators and their parasites, the search engine optimisation enterprises, crawl every single page including page histories, page diffs, and more, on my wikis. If every wanna-be search engine downloaded my index once a day, I would be saving resources. Whether that&rsquo;s a step in the right direction, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://neuromatch.social/@jonny" title="@jonny@neuromatch.social">@jonny</a> also said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i just think that the ability to fundamentally depart from the commercial structure of the web and all its brokenness doesn&rsquo;t happen gradually and esp. not with the server/client stack we have now</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, there must be another way. I just don&rsquo;t see it, right now. It&rsquo;s always hard to imagine a new world while you&rsquo;re still living in the old one. I&rsquo;m sure the solution will seem obvious to the next generation, looking back.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Search">#Search</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Feeds">#Feeds</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Butlerian_Jihad">#Butlerian Jihad</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-08-17</strong>. <a class="account" href="https://octodon.social/@splitbrain" title="@splitbrain@octodon.social">@splitbrain</a> suggested that this was the same as the sitemaps.org concept, but I think the sitemap lists the URLs available and you still have to crawl the site. At least now you never miss a page.</p>

<p>Would having such an index generate too much traffic? I think it would worm if all other crawling would stop. That’s the necessary trade-off, of course. No stupid crawlers lost in my wiki admin links (history pages, diffs) wasting resources – that is my goal. Also, since I ask for a crawl delay, crawling has to reconnect all the time, negotiate TLS all the time, start up CGI scripts all the time… having basically a static snapshot for download would obviate that (in a world where crawlers are smart enough to understand that the don’t need to crawl).</p>

<p><strong>2024-08-18</strong>. <a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@zens" title="@zens@merveilles.town">@zens</a> mentioned Lunr but then suggested that <a class="account" href="https://hachyderm.io/@byjp" title="@byjp@hachyderm.io">@byjp</a>&rsquo;s solution to the problem is even better: the server provides indexes that are used client-side and a browser extension allows querying multiple such indexes, locally.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lunr.js is a small, full-text search library for use in the browser. It indexes JSON documents and provides a simple search interface for retrieving documents that best match text queries.</p>

<p>After indexing, Pagefind adds a static search bundle to your built files, which exposes a JavaScript search API that can be used anywhere on your site. Pagefind also provides a prebuilt UI that can be used with no configuration. – <a href="https://pagefind.app/">Pagefind</a></p>

<p>Any time they visit the IndieSearch homepage (a page served from their browser extension) they can now search all the sites supporting IndieSearch they&rsquo;ve visited and/or included. – <a href="https://www.byjp.me/posts/indiesearch/">IndieSearch, byJP</a></p>

## 50 years on, Harlem Week shows how a New York City neighborhood went from crisis to renaissance

date: 2024-08-19, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — In 1974, Harlem’s deserted streets and tumbledown tenements told the story of a neighborhood left behind. Decades of disinvestment had culminated in a mass exodus known as urban flight and residents watched as their wealthier, more educated counterparts left the New York City neighborhood in droves.


But the tide turned when Percy Sutton, then the Manhattan borough president and New York City’s highest-ranking Black elected official, launched a campaign to bring back vitality to the historically African American neighborhood that had been known as a global Black mecca of arts, culture and entrepreneurship.


It became known as Harlem Week and would go on to draw back those who had departed. On Sunday, organizers celebrated Harlem Week's 50th anniversary after 18 days of free programming that showcased all the iconic neighborhood has to offer.


Harlem Week stands as “the constant line through the last 50 years of America’s most historic Black neighborhood,” said the Rev. Al Sharpton, whose National Action Network is headquartered in the neighborhood. “The dream of Percy Sutton and his peers in government, arts, the church and other elements of Harlem lives on, stronger than ever.”


In the 1970s, Harlem demanded more than an ordinary festival, if it wanted a resurrection. Those who remained in Harlem during urban flight — mostly low-income, Black families — would turn on their televisions to constant despair: crime reports, bleak statistics and reporters who called their home a “sinking ship.”


Sutton knew Harlem was due for a revitalizing, uplifting moment.


That summer, Sutton rallied religious, political, civic and artistic leaders that included Tito Puente, Max Roach, Maya Angelou, James Baldwin, Harry Belafonte, Sidney Poitier, Ruby Dee and Lloyd Williams. Together, they devised an event that would pivot the spotlight from Harlem’s troubles to its vibrant legacy: Harlem Day.


Radio disc jockeys Hal Jackson and Frankie Crocker produced a concert at the plaza of the Harlem State Office Building, while actor Ossie Davis cut a ribbon at 138th street and 7th Avenue, announcing the start of the “Second Harlem Renaissance.”


The ribbon-cutting ceremony renamed 7th Avenue to Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, named for the first African American elected to Congress from New York, marking the first time a New York City street took the name of a person of color.


“About two or three weeks later, Percy Sutton called us all and said it was such a successful day,” said Lloyd Williams, one of Harlem Day’s co-founders and the current president of the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce. “It meant so much to the other cities that were being deserted in Detroit and Baltimore, Washington and Chicago, that they asked if we would do it again on an annual basis.”


They did, and Harlem Day evolved into Harlem Weekend and eventually Harlem Week, which, before the pandemic, expanded to a full month of programming.


“Only in Harlem could a week be more than seven days,” said Williams, whose family has lived in Harlem since 1919.


This year's celebration featured entertainment, including a headlining set by hip-hop artist Fabolous, a tribute to Harry Belafonte and Broadway performances. Other concerts showcased jazz, reggae, R&B and gospel traditions nurtured in Harlem, alongside hundreds of food and merchandise vendors.


Organizers also included empowerment initiatives, such as financial literacy workshops and health screenings, at Harlem Health Village and the Children’s Festival. Every child who attended received a back-to-school backpack.


Harlem Week always has been a living tribute to Harlem’s history of greats, such as W.E.B. Du Bois, Langston Hughes, Augusta Savage and Aaron Douglas. It recognizes the Harlem Renaissance and Black Arts Movement and honors landmarks like the Apollo Theater and Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.


Many historians consider the late 1960s and the 1970s to be Harlem’s darkest years.


The area had been battered by unrest, including a 1964 riot that killed an unarmed Black teenager, Malcolm X’s assassination in 1965 and the turmoil after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination in 1968. Household incomes fell dramatically and infant mortality rates were high.


“The neighborhood was blighted,” recalled Malik Yoba, an actor born in the Bronx in 1967 who grew up in Harlem and spent days playing in the dirt of vacant lots. Yoba attended school in the Upper East Side with peers who had country homes upstate in the Hamptons.


“I didn’t understand why where we lived looked so dramatically different than where they lived,” he said. “I knew something was wrong.”


But Harlemites are creatives and entrepreneurs, visionaries and leaders. Where others saw decline, they saw opportunity, and the determination to match Harlem with its potential ran high.


Yoba, now 56, built a career as an actor showcasing Harlem to audiences across the nation. His experiences with housing inequality also fueled his passion for real estate.


Yoba combats the effects of redlining through his company Yoba Development, which provides young people of color access to the industry and has active projects in Baltimore and New York City.


“When you grow up in disenfranchised and divested communities, you can’t see the forest through the trees,” Yoba said. “You can grow up believing that walking by burnt-down buildings is your birthright, as opposed to understanding that building is a business.”


Hazel Dukes, 92, a prominent New York civil rights activist and Harlem resident of 30 years, has spent her life fighting discrimination in housing and education. She lived in the same Harlem building as Sutton and organized alongside him, later becoming a national president of the NAACP in 1989.


“I know what it feels to be denied,” said Dukes, who was born and raised in Montgomery, Alabama, and endured Jim Crow segregation. She moved to New York City with her parents in the 1950s.


Today, property in Harlem is coveted, driven by gentrification and its enduring cultural appeal.


“There was a waiting list, because everybody wanted to live in Harlem,” Dukes said. “People want to come to Harlem before they transition from this world.”

## Thousands of activists expected at Democratic convention to call for Gaza cease-fire

date: 2024-08-19, from: VOA News USA

CHICAGO — Thousands of activists are expected to converge on Chicago this week for the Democratic National Convention, hoping to call attention to abortion rights, economic injustice and the war in Gaza.


While Vice President Kamala Harris has energized crowds of supporters as she prepares to accept the Democratic nomination, progressive activists maintain their mission remains the same.


Activists say they learned lessons from last month's Republican National Convention in Milwaukee and are predicting bigger crowds and more robust demonstrations in Chicago, a city with deep social activism roots.


Who is protesting?


Demonstrations are expected every day of the convention and, while their agendas vary, many activists agree an immediate cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war is the priority.


Things are set to kick off Sunday on the convention's eve with an abortion rights march along Michigan Avenue.


Organizer Linda Loew said even though Democrats have pushed to safeguard reproductive rights at home, the issue is international. They will march in solidarity with people everywhere who struggle for the right to control what happens to their bodies, as well as to protest the money the U.S. spends to back wars that could be used for health care, she said.


"We believe that the billions of dollars that continue to flow to the state of Israel and the flow of weapons are having an inordinate and horrific impact, but in particular on women, children and the unborn," she said. "All of these things are tied together."


The largest group, the Coalition to March on the DNC, has planned demonstrations on the first and last days of the convention.


Organizers say they expect at least 20,000 activists, including students who protested the war on college campuses.


"The people with power are going to be there," said Liz Rathburn, a University of Illinois Chicago student organizer. "People inside the United Center are the people who are going to be deciding our foreign policy in one way or another."


Where are they protesting?


Activists sued the city earlier this year, saying restrictions over where they can demonstrate violate their constitutional rights.


Chicago leaders rejected their requests for permits to protest near United Center on the city's West Side, where the convention is taking place, offering instead a lakefront park more than 5 kilometers away.


Later, the city agreed to allow demonstrations at a park and a march route closer to the United Center. A federal judge recently signed off on the group's roughly 1.6-kilometer route.


Coalition to March on the DNC spokesman Hatem Abudayyeh said the group is pleased it won the right to protest closer to the convention, but he believes its preferred 3-kilometer march would be safer for larger crowds. The group is chartering buses for activists from about half a dozen states.


"We're going forward, full speed ahead," he said.


The city has designated a park about a block from United Center for a speakers' stage. Those who sign up get 45 minutes.


The Philadelphia-based Poor People's Army, which advocates for economic justice, plans to set up at Humboldt Park on the city's Northwest Side and will feature events with third-party candidates Jill Stein and Cornel West, plus a march Monday to the United Center.


Some group members have spent the last few weeks marching the more than 130 kilometers from Milwaukee, where they protested during the Republican convention.


"Poor and homeless people are being brutalized, with tents and encampments destroyed and bulldozed away, from San Francisco to Philadelphia to Gaza and the West Bank," spokesperson Cheri Honkala said in a statement as the group reached Illinois. "These preventable human rights violations are being committed by Democratic and Republican leaders alike."


How does a new nominee change things?


Many activists believe nothing much will change because Harris is part of the Biden administration.


"The demands haven't changed. I haven't seen any policy changes," said Erica Bentley, an activist with Mamas Activating Movements for Abolition and Solidarity. "If you're going to be here, you're going to have to listen to what's important to us."


Pro-Palestinian protesters in Chicago have been highly visible, shutting down roads to the airport and staging sit-ins at congressional offices. Some are planning their own one-day convention Sunday with third-party candidates.


"Regardless of who the nominee is, we're marching against the Democrats and their vicious policies that have allowed Israel to kill over 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza," said Fayaani Aboma Mijana, an organizer with the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression.


It's unclear if the convention will draw far-right extremists who ardently support former President Donald Trump.


Secret Service Deputy Special Agent in Charge Derek Mayer said last week there are no known specific security threats against the convention.


Is Chicago ready?


The convention will draw an estimated 50,000 people to the nation's third-largest city, including delegates, activists and journalists.


The city says it has made necessary preparations with police and the Secret Service. Security will be tight, with street closures around the convention center.


To combat traffic concerns, city leaders are touting a new $80 million train station steps from the United Center. They also have tried to beautify the city with freshly planted flowers and new signs. City leaders also cleared a nearby homeless encampment.


Police have undergone training on constitutional policing, county courts say they are opening more space in anticipation of mass arrests and hospitals near the security zone are beefing up emergency preparedness.


Authorities and leaders in the state have said people who vandalize the city or are violent will be arrested.


"We're going to make sure that people have their First Amendment rights protected, that they can do that in a safe way," Mayor Brandon Johnson told The Associated Press in a recent interview.


But some have lingering safety concerns, worried that protests could become unpredictable or devolve into chaos.


Activist Hy Thurman protested and was arrested at the infamous 1968 convention. The 74-year-old now lives in Alabama but plans to come to Chicago to protest the war in Gaza.


"It's extremely personal for me," he said. "I see parallels."


Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has said that he expects peaceful protests.


"We intend to protect the protesters' First Amendment rights, and also the residents of the city of Chicago and the visitors to Chicago at the same time," Pritzker told the AP in a recent interview.

## Twitter isn't over

<p>I was surprised that Donald Trump was so famous because I didn't watch reality TV. I come from NY and he was a pretty small thing in NY, even though I guess the rest of the world thinks he's big in NY.</p>
<ul>
<li>I come from Queens, actually, so I know the Trump character pretty well too. Self-important narcissists who inside feel worthless, lashing out at everything they come in contact with. Not the ordinary Scotch/German in Queens, but not that rare either.</li>
</ul>
<p>The same thing is probably happening now with Elon Musk, because attention of people like me has wandered away from Twitter, but the audience is huge, and probably every bit as movable as it was for Trump in 2016, and Musk owns it? Seems so.</p>

## South Korea, Japan, US renew pledge to cooperate on regional challenges

date: 2024-08-18, from: VOA News USA

Seoul, South Korea — The leaders of South Korea, Japan and the United States issued a joint statement Sunday marking the anniversary of their summit at Camp David and reaffirmed a pledge to jointly tackle regional challenges, South Korea's presidential office said.


The principles on trilateral cooperation established at the summit last year continue to serve as a roadmap for the three countries' cooperation, the statement issued by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's office said.


"We stand by our commitment to consult on regional challenges, provocations and threats affecting our collective interests and security," it said.


U.S. President Joe Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Yoon met on Aug. 18 last year and agreed to deepen military and economic cooperation and take a united stand against China's growing power and security threats from North Korea.


South Korean media have said the leaders plan to meet again this year, citing unnamed sources, but it was not yet clear when, especially since Kishida has announced he would be stepping down.


A senior South Korean presidential official said there will be two or three occasions where the three leaders will have the chance to meet and discussions over those plans are still in the early stages.


The spirit of cooperation among the three countries will live on even after Biden and Kishida leave office, the official told reporters on the condition of anonymity.


"The three main actors who established the Camp David framework of cooperation won't be in their roles forever," he said.

## Wall Street week ahead — 'Soft landing' hopes are back to lift US stocks after recession scare

date: 2024-08-18, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Hopes for an economic soft landing are once again powering U.S. stocks higher, as encouraging data relieve recession worries following a brutal sell-off earlier this month.


The S&P 500 .SPX has rebounded more than 6% since Aug. 5, when a steep drop pushed the benchmark U.S. index to its biggest three-day slide in over two years. A rapid return to calm was also evident in the Cboe Volatility Index .VIX, or Wall Street's "fear gauge," which has retreated from last week’s four-year highs at a record pace.


Driving the turnaround are last week's reports on retail sales, inflation and producer prices, which helped allay worries over an economic slowdown sparked by weaker-than-expected employment data at the start of the month. The favorable data has bolstered the case for investors looking to hop back aboard many of the trades that have worked this year, from buying Big Tech stocks to a more recent bet on small and mid-cap names that accelerated in July.


"There was a real growth scare that had emerged," said Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones. "Since then, what we've seen is the economic data has actually come out in a much more positive light."




Some of 2024's biggest winners have staged strong rebounds since Aug. 5. Chipmaker Nvidia NVDA.O has bounced more than 20%, while the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index .SOX has gained more than 14%. Small-cap shares, which had been strong performers in July, have also recovered from recent lows, with the Russell 2000 .RUT up nearly 5%.


Meanwhile, traders are unwinding bets that the Federal Reserve will need to deliver jumbo-sized rate cuts in September to stave off a recession.


As of late Thursday, futures tied to the Fed funds rate showed traders pricing a 25% chance that the central bank will lower rates by 50 basis points in September, down from around 85% on Aug. 5, CME FedWatch data showed. The probability of a 25 basis point cut stood at 75%, in line with expectations that the Fed will kick off an easing cycle in September.


"You can't necessarily rule out the hard landing scenario outright, but there's a lot of reason to believe that at this point that economic momentum is being sufficiently sustained," said Jim Baird, chief investment officer with Plante Moran Financial Advisors.


The Fed's plans could become clearer when Chair Jerome Powell speaks at the central bank's annual economic policy symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.


"We think a key highlight of Powell's speech will be the acknowledgement that progress on inflation has been sufficient to allow the start of rate cuts," economists at BNP Paribas said in a note on Thursday.


For the year, the S&P 500 is up more than 16% and is within about 2% from its July all-time closing high.


Mahajan, of Edward Jones, expects the soft-landing scenario, combined with lower interest rates, to help pave the way for more stocks to participate in the market's rally, instead of the small number of megacaps that have led indexes higher for much of this year.


Analysts at Capital Economics believe that a U.S. economic soft landing will support the artificial intelligence fervor that helped drive markets higher.


"Our end-2024 forecast for the S&P 500 remains at 6,000, driven by a view that the AI narrative which dominated in the first half of the year will reassert itself," they wrote. That target would be some 8% from the S&P 500's closing level on Thursday.


The recent economic data, while reassuring, is far from an all-clear for markets heading into September, which has historically been one of the year's more volatile periods. Investors will be closely watching Nvidia's earnings at the end of the month, and another employment report on Sept. 6.


"There's been a sigh of relief in the market, clearly," said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial. "The question now is, will the next payroll report underpin what the market expects at this point in terms of the soft landing."

## Mini farm animals become trendy in US

date: 2024-08-18, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK  — They're adorable. They require less food and space. And without much coaxing, they might help cut the grass. 


Americans are showing more interest in owning miniature cows, goats, donkeys and other diminutive farm animals, a trend driven by hobby farmers looking for easy-to-manage livestock and homesteaders who like the idea of having a petite pig or a scaled-down sheep as a pet. 


Animal breeders say sales of pint-sized farm animals have grown since the COVID-19 pandemic, when more people started raising backyard chickens for fun and fresh eggs. Like chickens, mini farm animals appeal to beginners who want the taste of a rugged, agrarian lifestyle. 


"A lot of people don't have access to several acres, but if they have a one-acre plot, they can keep a miniature cow or a few miniature goats," said Brian Gazda, who has a small farm in East Idaho and with two friends runs a YouTube channel called "Hobby Farm Guys." 


Platforms like YouTube and especially TikTok have played an important part in raising the profile of mini farm animals, said Martin Fysh, a vice president and divisional merchandising manager for rural lifestyle retailer Tractor Supply Co. On any given day, TikTok users put cuteness on parade with videos of tiny blue-eyed goats and 2-foot-tall horses that have received millions of views. 


But Fysh thinks the trend also reflects a natural progression among customers who started out with a backyard hen coop. In response, Tractor Supply has increased its selection of treats for both mini and regular sized pigs, and goats. 


"They're seen as part of the extended family, " Fysh said. 




While some people buy small farm animals as a stepping stone to owning larger ones, others don't have a desire to expand. Some owners of mini farm animals turn their hobbies into side hustles by giving visitor tours, breeding animals, and blogging about their pastoral experiences. 


But before playing Old Macdonald, newcomers need to weigh the pros and cons, Gazda and other hobby farmers said. 


Among the challenges: the volatile nature of prices for each of the types of miniature farm animals. And while they're cute, they also can be aggressive. 


Mini goats 


Brittany Snow, a high school English teacher in Florida, owns several small-sized Nigerian Dwarf goats. She realized her dream of living on a farm three years ago when her family moved from the Jacksonville suburb of Middleburg to nearby Melrose. 


She said her family wanted to be more self-sustaining after the pandemic and now sources its own dairy products, such as milk and eggs. She sticks mostly with miniature animals because they're easier to take care of and cost less to acquire and feed. 


Snow, 32, started with four Nigerian Dwarf goats: Buttercup, Snowflake, Cash and Peanut. The herd has since expanded to include Pancake and Oreo, the kids of Peanut and Buttercup. 


Snow purchased the Nigerian Dwarf goats intending to milk them to make cheese and products like soap and lotion. But that hasn't worked yet because goats only lactate after giving birth, and Buttercup only recently had her kids. 


"The past few years have been a learning curve," Snow said. 


Mini goats are one of the most popular entry-level mini animals. In the past year, animal breeders have registered roughly 8,330 mini goats with the Miniature Dairy Goat Association. That's a 73% jump from the 12 months before July 2021, when registrations — mostly for newborn females sought after by breeders — totaled just under 4,800, said Angelia Alden, a business operations manager for the North Carolina-based organization. 


Many folks who favor mini goats, however, tend to sell them after a few years because it can be challenging — and expensive — to take care of them, Alden said. Rising animal feed costs can be a headache, as is finding adequate medical care due to a shortage of farm veterinarians. 


Mini cows and donkeys 


A farm animal can be both mini and mighty. Some of the four-legged stars on social media are furry cows that can weigh 500-600 pounds. The smallest, which stand under 3 feet in height, are known as micro-miniatures. The slightly bigger miniatures can be as tall as 42 inches, according to Allie Sine, a TikTok creator with more than 737,000 followers on the platform. Videos showcasing some of her mini cows have gotten millions of views. 


Sine, 28, launched her own business breeding and selling mini cows in 2020 after reselling a sick mini cow that cost $350 for $5,000. Last year, she sold about 190 calves through her Missouri-based business, Mini Moos LLC. The calves were roughly split between mini and micromini cows that can cost from $2,000 to $30,000. 


"Everything just skyrocketed," Sine said. 


Others report a similar boom. 


Kim Furches, who owns a farm with her husband, Ken, in West Jefferson, North Carolina, said the couple bred mini donkeys for about 20 years and currently own dozens of Mediterranean miniature donkeys, which stand 3 feet high or less. 


Before the pandemic, they would typically sell about eight donkeys per year and count themselves lucky if they received a couple thousand dollars for one. They now sell about 20 per year. The last mini donkey sold for $7,500, Furches said. There are some she's only willing to sell for $9,000 or more. 


New types of 'exotic' pets 


Though some of their customers plan to breed and sell mini animals, too, many say many are just looking for "exotic" pets, Gazda said. 


Earlier this year, Jamie Campion, 41, and her husband, Jeff, bought two Southdown Babydoll sheep from a local breeder near their home in Thompson's Station, Tennessee, for $800 each. The couple moved from Chicago in March 2022 after the pandemic made them rethink their lifestyle. They now live in a modern-style farmhouse built on an acre of land. 




While Biscuit and Buttermilk have become excellent lawn trimmers, Jamie Campion said she considers the animals — which weigh about 70 pounds and stand 20 inches high — similar to a dog or a cat. 


"They eat the grass, so we don't even have to buy food (for the sheep) on a weekly basis," said Campion who discovered the breed on Instagram. 


But it can be challenging. 


One time, Jeff Campion tried to inject one of sheep with oral medication to treat parasites, and it tore his bicep. 




But more often, the sheep give her joy. Jamie Campion recalls taking them out on a snowy day for a walk in the neighborhood, without a leash. 


"They just followed right behind," she said. "There's a whole sheep and shepherd relationship. " 


Miniature animals offer therapy 


Others see therapeutic benefits. 


Lisa Moad, who owns Seven Oaks Farm in Hamilton, Ohio, and has 13 miniature horses and three regular-size horses, operates a therapy farm for older people and others. She also used to take the miniature horses to local nursing homes and hospitals. But since the pandemic, she has spent most of her timing conducting online training for those looking to embrace the same mission. 


That includes teaching horses how to maneuver around wheelchairs and into elevators of hospitals. She said her miniature versions still weigh 175 to 200 pounds, though much less than her regular horses, which range from 1,200 to 1,500 pounds. 


"They're docile, but they can get frightened easily, " she said. "You just can't walk into a hospital with a horse."

## US schools make slow progress on record absenteeism

date: 2024-08-18, from: VOA News USA

MEDFORD, Mass.  — Flerentin "Flex" Jean-Baptiste missed so much school he had to repeat his freshman year at Medford High outside Boston. At school, "you do the same thing every day," said Jean-Baptiste, who was absent 30 days his first year. "That gets very frustrating."


Then his principal did something nearly unheard of: She let students play organized sports during lunch — if they attended all their classes. In other words, she offered high schoolers recess.


"It gave me something to look forward to," said Jean-Baptiste, 16. The following year, he cut his absences in half. Schoolwide, the share of chronically absent students declined from 35% in March 2023 to 23% in March 2024 — one of the steepest declines among Massachusetts high schools.


Years after COVID-19 upended American schooling, nearly every state is still struggling with attendance, according to data collected by The Associated Press and Stanford University educational economist Thomas Dee.


Roughly one in four students in the 2022-23 school year remained chronically absent, meaning they missed at least 10% of the school year. That represents about 12 million children in the 42 states and Washington, D.C., where data is available.


Before the pandemic, only 15% of students missed that much school.


Society may have largely moved on from COVID, but schools say they're still battling the effects of pandemic school closures. After as much as a year at home, school for many kids has felt overwhelming, boring or socially stressful. More than ever, kids and parents are deciding it's OK to stay home, which makes catching up even harder.


In all but one state, Arkansas, absence rates remain higher than pre-pandemic. Still, the problem appears to have passed its peak; almost every state saw absenteeism improve at least slightly from 2021-22 to 2022-23.


Schools are working to identify students with slipping attendance, then providing help. They're working to close communication gaps with parents, who often aren't aware their child is missing so much school or why it's problematic.


So far, the solutions that appear to be helping are simple — like postcards to parents that compare a child's attendance with peers. But to make more progress, experts say, schools must get creative to address their students' needs.




Caring adults — and incentives


In Oakland, California, chronic absenteeism skyrocketed from 29% pre-pandemic to 53% in 2022-23 across district and charter schools. Officials asked students what would convince them to come to class.


Money, they replied, and a mentor.


A grant-funded program launched in spring 2023 paid 45 students $50 weekly for perfect attendance. Students also checked in daily with an assigned adult and completed weekly mental health assessments.


Paying students isn't a permanent or sustainable fix, said Zaia Vera, the district's head of social-emotional learning.


But many absent students lacked stable housing or were helping to support their families. "The money is the hook that got them in the door," Vera said.


More than 60% improved their attendance after taking part, Vera said. The program is expected to continue, along with district-wide efforts aimed at creating a sense of belonging. Oakland's African American Male Achievement project, for example, pairs Black students with Black teachers who offer support.


Kids who identify with their educators are more likely to attend school, said Michael Gottfried, a University of Pennsylvania professor. According to one study led by Gottfried, California students felt "it's important for me to see someone who's like me early on, first thing in the day," he said.


A caring teacher made a difference for Golden Tachiquin, 18, who graduated from Oakland's Skyline High School this spring. When she started 10th grade after a remote freshman year, she felt lost and anxious. She later realized these feelings caused the nausea and dizziness that kept her home sick. She was absent at least 25 days that year.


But she bonded with an Afro-Latina teacher who understood her culturally and made Tachiquin, a straight-A student, feel her poor attendance didn't define her.


"I didn't dread going to her class," Tachiquin said.


Another teacher had the opposite effect. "She would say, 'Wow, guess who decided to come today?' " Tachiquin recalled. "I started skipping her class even more."


In Massachusetts, Medford High School requires administrators to greet and talk with students each morning, especially those with a history of missing school.


But the lunchtime gym sessions have been the biggest driver of improved attendance, Principal Marta Cabral said. High schoolers need freedom and an opportunity to move their bodies, she said. "They're here for seven hours a day. They should have a little fun."


Stubborn circumstances


Chronically absent students are at higher risk of illiteracy and eventually dropping out. They also miss the meals, counseling and socialization provided at school.


Many of the reasons kids missed school early in the pandemic are still firmly in place: financial hardship, transportation problems, mild illness and mental health struggles.


In Alaska, 45% of students missed significant school last year. In Amy Lloyd's high school classes in Juneau, some families now treat attendance as optional. Last term, several of her English students missed school for vacations.


"I don't really know how to reset the expectation that was crushed when we sat in front of the computer for that year," Lloyd said.


Emotional and behavioral problems also have kept kids home from school. Research shared exclusively with AP found absenteeism and poor mental health are "interconnected," said University of Southern California professor Morgan Polikoff.


For example, in the USC study, almost a quarter of chronically absent kids had high levels of emotional or behavioral problems, according to a parent questionnaire, compared with just 7% of kids with good attendance. Emotional symptoms among teen girls were especially linked with missing school.


How sick is too sick?


When chronic absence surged to around 50% in Fresno, California, officials realized they had to remedy pandemic-era mindsets about keeping kids home sick.


"Unless your student has a fever or threw up in the last 24 hours, you are coming to school. That's what we want," said Abigail Arii, director of student support services.


Often, said Noreida Perez, who oversees attendance, parents aren't aware physical symptoms can point to mental health struggles — such as when a child doesn't feel up to leaving their bedroom.


More than a dozen states now let students take mental health days as excused absences. But staying home can become a vicious cycle, said Hedy Chang, of Attendance Works, which works with schools on absenteeism.


"If you continue to stay home from school, you feel more disengaged," she said. "You get farther behind."


Changing the culture around sick days is only part of the problem.


At Fresno's Fort Miller Middle School, where half the students were chronically absent, two reasons kept coming up: dirty laundry and no transportation. The school bought a washer and dryer for families' use, along with a Chevy Suburban to pick up students who missed the bus. Overall, Fresno's chronic absenteeism improved to 35% in 2022-23.


Melinda Gonzalez, 14, missed the school bus about once a week and would call for rides in the Suburban.


"I don't have a car; my parents couldn't drive me to school," Gonzalez said. "Getting that ride made a big difference."

## Running Postgres inside Node-RED via WASM and PGlite

date: 2024-08-18, from: Conor O'Niell's blog, Cross Dominant

I&rsquo;ve been using Node-RED for many years, mostly for fun and personal projects. The coolest thing I did with it was to build the prototype for the NodeConf EU 2018 badge back-end.
But 2024 is the first time I&rsquo;ve worked with it in production, with the ServisBOT team doing some pretty incredible things using it. One aspect I&rsquo;ve been interested in recently is local persistence beyond context stores. Of course my first port of call was the world&rsquo;s greatest database, SQLite.
