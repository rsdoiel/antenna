## I visited Ride1Up’s e-bike factory to find the secret behind good quality, low-cost e-bikes

## Pier for Gaza aid in place, US military says

date: 2024-05-16, from: VOA News USA

PENTAGON — The U.S. military says a temporary pier is now anchored to the shore of Gaza, the final step in completing a sea route to distribute aid to 2 million Gazans affected by the Israel-Hamas war.


"This morning, just a few hours ago, the pier was successfully affixed to the beach in Gaza. In the coming days, we will commence the delivery of aid," U.S. Vice Admiral Brad Cooper told reporters Thursday.


Cooper said about 500 tons of humanitarian assistance have been loaded onto ships, with thousands of tons more ready to be added to the distribution queue once that aid is distributed.


“We are focused on flooding the zone with humanitarian assistance … to complement the provision of aid through land routes, which we know is the most efficient and effective pathway to move the necessary volume of assistance,” he said.


The new maritime corridor has several parts, with aid first undergoing inspection and security checks in Cyprus. Loads are then being taken to a U.S.-built floating platform off the Gaza coast and transferred onto trucks, with smaller boats taking the trucks to the newly anchored pier that juts out several hundred meters from the Gaza coastline.


 




Distribution


Each boat can transfer between five and 15 trucks to shore. Once fully operational, the pier will be able to provide about 150 truckloads of aid to Gaza per day, according to U.S. officials.


The United Nations will receive shipments and coordinate distribution on the ground for the Gazans. The arrangement is part of an effort to boost what humanitarian organizations say is a vastly insufficient amount of aid for Palestinian civilians. 


“The American corridor is absolutely essential to helping meet this gap in need to address the shelter, the food, the health, malnutrition and clean water sanitation needs,” said Sonali Korde, assistant to the administrator of USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance.


Some aid groups have said the maritime corridor is not the best solution, arguing that increasing the flow of aid through land crossings would be far more effective.


“We need to just continue to work on getting more aid in through all routes,” Korde said. “We're at a point in time when this is all hands on deck. We can't spare any effort.”


Aid has been slow to get into Gaza due to long backups of vehicles at Israeli inspection points. The United States and other nations have air dropped food into Gaza 38 times in recent months, but each air drop via military accounts for only about one to three truckloads of food, a U.S. official told VOA.


Aid organizations have said several hundred truckloads of food are needed in Gaza each day.


The pier’s completion was delayed for several days due to rough seas.


 




Security


Security for the approximately 1,000 U.S. forces building the pier and aid organizations distributing the supplies has been the paramount concern for the Pentagon since the plan’s conception, according to Cooper.


"This is a 100% humanitarian mission, and any attack on those working on it is an attack on aid for the people of Gaza, " said Cooper.


Security forces have conducted rehearsals in preparation for the commencement of operations and will continue to assess and reassess security, Cooper said.


Israel Defense Forces have dedicated a brigade of troops, along with ships and air assets, to help ensure force protection. IDF engineers prepared the beach for the temporary pier and secured it to the beach.


Israel attacked Hamas in Gaza following Hamas’ October 7 terror attack on Israel, which killed 1,200 people and saw hundreds more taken hostage.


In the nearly seven months since the attack, more than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to Gazan health officials.

## How Republicans Engineered a Fake Meat Controversy

date: 2024-05-16, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjI1Mjk1NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMjIwMDcwN30.J4iu3n3WX6-xAEyOXW_50VpTrg6RNXifctOdVzkfY8Y/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">At a triumphant bill-signing earlier this month, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis sounded less like the leader of the nation’s third largest state and more like the host of a QAnon podcast. “Today, Florida is fighting back against the global elite’s plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish or bugs to achieve their authoritarian goals,” <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2024/05/01/governor-desantis-signs-legislation-to-keep-lab-grown-meat-out-of-florida/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he said</u></a>. DeSantis was there to trumpet a new state law that outlaws the sale of lab-grown meat, also known as <a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/lab-grown-meat-florida-desantis" target="_self"><u>cultivated meat</u></a>. </p><p>One might reasonably ask why DeSantis and his Republican allies care about lab-grown meat at all. The technology — in which cells from animals are fed with nutrients and grown until they eventually produce something resembling a cut of actual meat — is still in the experimental stage, and it could be decades before companies are able to produce it on an industrial scale, if ever. So why bother outlawing it?</p><p>But DeSantis is not alone. Legislators in Alabama, apparently satisfied that they have solved all the state’s other problems, rushed to pass a similar law, which Gov. Kay Ivey <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/13/lab-grown-meat-ban-alabama/73678952007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>signed</u></a> on May 7. Similar measures have also been introduced in Arizona, Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia. And it isn’t just Republicans; a few Democrats looking to fortify their carnivorous bona fides have also attacked cultivated meat. Pennsylvania’s Democratic Senator John Fetterman <a href="https://twitter.com/SenFettermanPA/status/1786064644383142187" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>applauded</u></a> DeSantis’ action, saying he “would never serve that slop to my kids,” and Montana Democrat Sen. Jon Tester — who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIvbGBIJHa4&t=5s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lost three fingers</u></a> in a meat grinder as a boy — <a href="https://www.tester.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tester-champions-montanas-ranchers-introduces-bipartisan-bill-to-ban-schools-from-serving-lab-grown-meat/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>introduced a bill</u></a> to ban cultivated meat from school lunches.</p><p>So far, Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has not weighed in on lab-grown meat. But given his taste for outré conspiracy theories and niche culture war issues, no one would be surprised if he began railing against it in his rallies and on Truth Social. </p><p>This is fundamentally a fake issue: Not only is there no place you can buy lab-grown meat in Florida or Alabama, there’s no place you can buy it anywhere in the country. Last year the Department of Agriculture <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/us-approves-chicken-made-cultivated-cells-nations-first-lab-grown-meat-rcna90439" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gave approval</u></a> for lab-grown chicken to be sold, and not long after it was featured as a special menu item at the upscale restaurants Bar Crenn in San Francisco and José Andrés’ China Chilcano in Washington (reviews were mixed but <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23801730/cell-cultivated-lab-grown-meat-jose-andres-upside-eat-just" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mostly positive</u></a>). But those experiments have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/upside-foods-good-meat-cultivated-lab-grown-sale-stopped-singapore-california-crenn/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ended</u></a>, and it could be a while before it’s available again even in a restaurant. The technological challenges in recreating both the taste and texture of meat have proven greater than many anticipated; the problem may not be insurmountable, but it hasn’t been surmounted yet, at least not at scale.</p><p>But it’s just the kind of issue Republicans (and Democrats in swing states) love, one that casts them as the defenders of the honest, traditional, and manly, while mainstream Democrats are supposedly the advocates of weird and vaguely effeminate ideas. Why would you let some egghead scientist make you a steak? Real men want to know that their meat was killed in the most unpleasant circumstances possible. </p><p>Then there’s the climate angle: While Republicans may not exactly be pro-climate change in their rhetoric (policy choices are another matter), they are eagerly anti-anti-climate change, in the same way they’re anti-anti-racism. Just as they wage the culture war by opposing efforts to undo racism, they can do the same by opposing efforts to address climate change, shifting the conversation from the real problem onto the supposedly oppressive efforts to solve it.</p><p>And solving climate change is one of the rationales for cultivated meat that has helped attract venture capital to the startups trying to make it a reality. Global demand for meat has <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>risen steadily</u></a> for decades, and will <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00322-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>continue to grow</u></a> as incomes increase (generally speaking, the wealthier a country is, the more meat its citizens consume). In 2022, humans <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/animals-slaughtered-for-meat" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>slaughtered</u></a> 300 million cows, 1.5 billion pigs, and an incredible 75 billion chickens. Advocates of lab-grown meat sell it as a way to mitigate both that almost unfathomable carnage, with all its attendant animal suffering, and the enormous climate effects of meat production. </p><p>And unlike plant-based meat substitutes, lab-grown meat would satisfy the human desire to consume genuine animal flesh. There’s almost certainly a limit on how many people will want to eat Impossible Burgers and “Chick-n” tenders, no matter how good they taste. But since cultivated meat is still meat, advocates say any carnivore should be happy to bite into a lab-grown steak — which is why it’s so important for certain politicians to convince them that doing so would make them some kind of hippie. </p><p>I’d submit that politicians like DeSantis don’t actually care whether anyone sells or eats a cultivated pork loin. The point is to convince people that they are under siege from the powerful forces of wokeness, who want to steal your gustatory freedom after they confiscate your guns and force your children to change genders. </p><p>The invocation of bug-eating is a key tell. When DeSantis tells people that “the global elite” wants to force you to eat bugs, he’s referencing a conspiracy theory that the average person may not have heard of but is widespread on the right. Bill Gates and other leftist puppetmasters, <a href="https://sentientmedia.org/bill-gates-bug-eating-conspiracy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the theory goes</u></a>, have a plan to enslave us all and force us to eat bugs for our protein. </p><p>One of the benefits of associating bug-eating with a different food you want to discredit is that it produces feelings of disgust, which social psychologists have long known are <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn26481-left-or-right-wing-brains-disgust-response-tells-all/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more powerful</u></a> for conservatives than for liberals. As Tucker Carlson <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/31/1167550482/how-a-conspiracy-theory-about-eating-bugs-made-its-way-to-international-politics" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>once said</u></a>, “Eating insects is repulsive and un-American. And of course, therefore, in the eyes of the left, it must be awesome.” </p><p>Here’s the counterpoint, thought: One might also think that this is an issue of basic liberty. Cultivated meat might or might not become widely consumed as an alternate food source, but if it does, as long as it’s safe you should be able to eat it if you want to (and the same ought to go for bugs). We can say with a fair bit of confidence that there will still be old-fashioned lamb chops and roast chickens available for all of our lifetimes. </p><p>But as an opportunity to create another front in the culture war and remind voters that politics is all about identity, it’s too good for Republicans in Florida and Alabama, and maybe other states to come, to pass up. If there’s a woke hippie conspiracy afoot to rob you of your testosterone and make you slave to the global elite, they want voters to know they’ll be on it. Even if it’s imaginary.</p>

## White House blocks release of Biden's special counsel interview audio

date: 2024-05-16, from: VOA News USA

Washington — President Joe Biden has asserted executive privilege over audio of his interview with special counsel Robert Hur that's at the center a Republican effort to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress, the Justice Department told lawmakers on Thursday.


It comes as the House Oversight and Accountability Committee and the Judiciary Committee are each expected to hold a hearing to recommend that the full House refer Garland to the Justice Department for the contempt charges over the department's refusal to hand over the audio.


Garland advised Biden in a letter on Thursday that the audio falls within the scope of executive privilege. Garland told the Democratic president that the "committee's needs are plainly insufficient to outweigh the deleterious effects that the production of the recordings would have on the integrity and effectiveness of similar law enforcement investigations in the future."


Assistant Attorney General Carlos Felipe Uriarte urged lawmakers not to proceed with the contempt effort to avoid "unnecessary and unwarranted conflict."


"It is the longstanding position of the executive branch held by administrations of both parties that an official who asserts the president's claim of executive privilege cannot be held in contempt of Congress," Uriarte wrote.


White House Counsel Ed Siskel wrote in a separate, scathing letter to Congress on Thursday that lawmakers' effort to obtain the recording was absent any legitimate purpose and lays bare their likely goal — "to chop them up, distort them, and use them for partisan political purposes."


The White House memo is a tacit admission that there are moments from the interview it fears portray Biden in a negative light in an election year — and that could be exacerbated by the release, or selective release, of the audio.


The transcript of the Hur interview showed Biden struggling to recall some dates and occasionally confusing some details — something longtime aides says he's done for years in both public and private — but otherwise showing deep recall in other areas. Biden and his aides are particularly sensitive to questions about his age. At 81, he's the oldest ever president, and he's seeking another four year term.


Hur found some evidence that Biden had willfully retained classified information and disclosed it to a ghostwriter but concluded that it was insufficient for criminal charges.

</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Biden expands solar tariffs to include bifacial modules</h3><p>
	The Biden administration is <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VWY4xT3tZksxN3bRJvh3t3xmW2gkVcw5f7-s6N4Yn9N-3qn9gW7Y8-PT6lZ3mNV3yPLl8zjRynW7Sx2s73JXYKjM7L5YbSsg19W27LCl148LJgJW66SLr864JSz6W8t7QZ82h_TD3W4G_C4v7F3nvSW93qx4W3sFYPMW95h1FY816p3VW50BGmw2n4KtWVYjH3c3tsw0QW3ggtnT20JBlkW2GVlqw31Wmh6W2hpyX35jZ7cmW3Xpz6J7-hctzW6_KS8k7tWtGpW9g3fyF38j_RDN6Nv_t8qcn4DW5pPn5s3K0mLjW8xcs8G4v2lRtW5GymVc6hvs4bW3Mfwxp7S4WLpW94KkDv1Hr2GMW34YJqr1n_vnmW5vflqN6tkdGsW4x2vnv3d51Tgf6xLK2n04" target="_blank">expanding existing solar panel tariffs</a> to include the popular two-sided (or bifacial) modules used in many utility-scale solar installations. The solar manufacturing industry and elected representatives in states that have seen large solar manufacturing investments have been pushing to end the tariffs exclusion. With this move, the Biden administration is decisively intervening in the solar industry’s <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VWY4xT3tZksxN3bRJvh3t3xmW2gkVcw5f7-s6N4Yn9N-3qn9gW7Y8-PT6lZ3mKN7v6BNzp2C7QW1X4BQf93YKq-W6qH_gm4SrgzXW7mZ5bG5Gm6JlW4jbjzm8P649TW162Hqp9l9w7gVcSB747zLYVgN7dwft-FZLTSW3yXz_G4ZFXQRW3_gqpj7Rfx8VW8hzy-_93KdDyW689Ymr6l8BDnW1X5hps3Dnx2SV_gm4H5Y1w6RVDh4pC6hfJ0zW5nWbk35_4fvnW2D2ymX2j9W9qN7n9JnZ7WNxZW6_j9JL5Rwcb3W3tWr1t1yzVC3W5X4M081wNFfdW3qgL186C0Q8LW6xBPH88VbyRPW4F_Qbx5qm-5MW2Kx4RX8gKtqVW1bZQ5B68D_Jxf8NwWmK04" target="_blank">raging feud</a> on the side of the adolescent-but-quickly-maturing domestic solar manufacturing industry, wrote Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin. Bifacial modules are estimated to account for over 90% of U.S. module imports. That amounted to some $4.3 billion of incoming orders in the first six months of last year. Developers who have contracts to buy bifacial panels that will be shipped within 90 days will still be able to import them without duties, and the tariffs also allow a quota of solar cells, which are later assembled into modules, to be imported without charges.

	Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis yesterday <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VWY4xT3tZksxN3bRJvh3t3xmW2gkVcw5f7-s6N4Yn9Mv5nXHsW50kH_H6lZ3mCW1q9kdD4RlmwlW5dnN3c3-212dW39jHXt3cHPDHN8H0fvkQXwHnW8zMFYL7N4jgXW3KKrFD60m5cfN8w6MMrptkz2N9gzj7ksmt6bW8RMRFV2MYQ3BW7sXDVZ69GhPFW4-7VNt7wKLlZW3Q7Hky3fycKHVWXjtr2PS0STVsK4y21t170PVnYBHd5-YTypW7rV8pP8XHwwfW843mRD86WlCLW8gWkNS6Gzt5HVj6yp_4rDqXYVR0Vkm795Zl5N4FkTgS1qsXsN5-_D0wSQ_sQW5P6V1X2gJrDgW1MlmRr1hlBs-W4S4lzN2VS_4nN6gtJwjPstnBW1wjGJ48yC1l5W2GM0hB32cngJW4B6cL55Mmw2BW909TG788TxjlW7QwQp_7L7xtvW2GKF513SlBvLf5nW7Hd04" target="_blank">signed</a> legislation that will result in most references to climate change being removed from state law. While the scrubbing of climate change is leading most headlines, the law does a few other important things, too:
</p><ul>
<li>It nixes requirements for state government to prioritize climate change when writing energy policy.</li>
<li>It removes language that gave state officials the authority to set goals for renewable energy.</li>
<li>It bans offshore wind turbines in state waters.</li>
<li>It repeals state grant programs that encourage energy conservation and renewable energy.</li>
<li>It deletes requirements for state agencies to use environmentally-friendly products and fuel-efficient vehicles.</li>
<li>It prevents municipalities from dictating which fuels can be used in appliances like gas stoves.</li>
<li>It waters down regulation of gas pipelines and boosts expansion of gas.</li>
</ul><p>
<span></span>Florida is extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change, from deadly heat waves to stronger and more frequent storms and sea level rise.

	The North American electric grid has “adequate anticipated resources for normal summer peak load and conditions,” the North American Electric Reliability Corporation <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VWY4xT3tZksxN3bRJvh3t3xmW2gkVcw5f7-s6N4Yn9Pg3qn9gW8wLKSR6lZ3lqW2HnVkl6zvkFzW2xdqvF7hdPSBMl2Bw1Z6h6cN91Khyj8pY0xW61QF2k472m_RW3xD57X7Wsvm3W1pMDqb5cYwr6W7kZKCB5Yf_M7W5Dpf1-1l6DFmW1HX9Td5fGxhFW89p5qp8k4w6LW162tW898bYpNW7bjv0B6RGV7kW5by_Tx1NyRHBW1XD_Wx2qYlXcW7GjpV27KZl8kW14zgMN1400bQW4BzJ7071n1mYW57Lf9-5CvL47W6KpTx87jC696W8NF2RQ8FMr6gVS788b2nqtZCW3DCY_T3t74K4W214D1N3M1y6gW7xydbC55kY4rW1ZK3qb6d351vW64PH9L2R83hmW7Ff4X12yKGT8dd03Q204" target="_blank">said yesterday</a>. The nonprofit reliability organizaton’s chief executive officer Jim Robb said there are “fewer areas at risk than last year, but significant concerns remain at the system’s ability to perform under extreme conditions.” The report lays out summer reliability risks by region, including nuclear plant outages in Ontario, Canada, less-than-expected wind power generation in the middle of the U.S., and a heat wave affecting western states and Mexico.

<p>Stock traders on Wall Street were feeling bullish on Wednesday. All three major stock indexes in the U.S. rose to record highs on the back of yesterday’s inflation report. The consumer price index report, which showed inflation cooling, made traders optimistic about the prospect of an interest rate cut. Then, we&#8217;ll delve into the staggering costs of inequities in mental health care and hear how Americans are feeling about tariffs on Chinese goods.</p>

## Biden Takes a Side in the Solar Industry’s Family Feud

On the other side is the more established solar development, installation, and financing industry, which tends to support the widespread availability of cheaper solar components, even if they come from China or Chinese-owned companies in Southeast Asia.</p><p>These particular solar modules, known as bifacial modules, are estimated to account for over 90% of U.S. module imports. That amounted to some $4.3 billion of incoming orders in the first six months of last year, according to a report by the International Trade Commission, an almost three-fold increase from the first six months of the year prior.</p><p>Tariffs on solar modules were first imposed by the Trump administration in 2018 and later extended in 2022, with the levy rate falling to around 14% from the initial 30%.</p><p>Domestic and global solar supply chains are under threat from “unfair and non-market practices,” as well as “Chinese solar panel overcapacity,” National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi said on a call with reporters — hence the expanded tariffs.</p><p>The solar manufacturing industry and elected representatives in states that have seen large solar manufacturing investments have been pushing to end the exclusion. Georgia Senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, for instance, wrote a letter to President Biden in March calling for the bifacial exemption to be removed, arguing that “the elimination of the exemption for bifacial panels would strengthen the United States’ and Georgia’s economy, protect U.S. national security, and serve the nation’s long-term economic and energy security interests.”</p><p>The Korean solar company Qcells is planning to invest more than <a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2023/10/19/qcells-expands-2-5-billion-us-solar-factory/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$2 billion in solar manufacturing in Georgia</u></a>. The American solar manufacturer First Solar has <a href="https://www.firstsolar.com/en/Resources/Blogs/First-Solar-Responds-to-Bifacial-Exemption" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>long campaigned</u></a> for bifacial modules to be included in the tariffs. </p><p>White House climate advisor John Podesta cited the International Trade Commission report during the briefing with reporters to demonstrate that an increase in bifacial imports had occurred while <a href="https://www.usitc.gov/publications/other/pub5494.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>imports of other types of modules had fallen</u></a>. “The findings … made clear that the bifacial exemption was likely being abused, and that that tariff exemption was no longer appropriate,” Podesta said.<br/><br/>The White House is not completely deaf to the preferences of the other side of the solar industry, however.<br/><br/>Developers who have contracts to buy bifacial panels that will be shipped within 90 days will still be able to import them without duties, Podesta said, “to avoid undue disruptions to the industry.”</p><p>The tariffs also allow a quota of solar cells, which are later assembled into modules, to be imported without charges. Zaidi said that “raising … the tariff rate quota to facilitate the availability of solar cells for manufacturers here in the United States will be necessary to make sure we're sprinting into the acceleration that's necessary to grow the U.S. manufacturing capacity.”</p><p>The solar lobby had been asking for at least an increase in the tariff rate quota. While they weren’t able to win the war over tariffs, they’re still getting something.</p>

## TSMC says no damage to its Arizona facilities after incident

date: 2024-05-16, from: VOA News USA

TAIPAI, TAIWAN — Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC said Thursday there was no damage to its facilities after an incident at its Arizona factory construction site where

a waste disposal truck driver was transported to a hospital.


Firefighters responded to a reported explosion Wednesday afternoon at the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company plant in Phoenix, the Arizona Republic reported, citing the local fire department.


TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker whose clients include Apple and Nvidia, said in a statement none of its employees or onsite construction workers had reported any related injuries.


"This is an active investigation with no additional details that can be shared at this time," it added.


TSMC's Taipei-listed shares pared earlier gains after the news and were last up around 0.8% on Thursday morning. TSMC last month agreed to expand its planned investment by $25 billion to $65 billion and to add a third Arizona plant by 2030.


The company will produce the world's most advanced 2 nanometer technology at its second Arizona facility expected to begin production in 2028.

## US, Niger delegation meet to discuss US forces withdrawal

date: 2024-05-16, from: VOA News USA

Pentagon — After nearly a two-week delay, U.S. and Nigerien officials are holding high-level follow-on meetings to coordinate the withdrawal of American troops from the country.


Christopher Maier, assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict, and Lieutenant General Dagvin Anderson, joint staff director for joint force development, are meeting Wednesday and Thursday in Niamey with members of Niger’s new government, known as the National Council for Safeguarding the Homeland, or CNSP, two U.S. officials told VOA.


The CNSP posted on the social platform X Wednesday that Maier and Anderson met Wednesday with Lieutenant General Salifou Mody, one of the military coup members who was named minister of national defense. 


The CNSP noted that the meeting comes two months after Niger denounced its military basing agreements with the United States and aims to “ensure that this withdrawal takes place in the best possible conditions, guaranteeing order, security and compliance with set deadlines.”


There are about 900 U.S. military personnel in Niger, including active duty, civilians and contractors, according to the U.S. officials, who spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity ahead of the conclusion of the talks. Most of the U.S. military personnel have stayed in the country past their deployment’s planned end dates, as details for their withdrawal are ironed out.


“We're still in a bit of a holding pattern,” Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said last week.




Counterterrorism in 'disarray'


The U.S. has had two military bases — Air Base 101 in Niamey and Air Base 201 in Agadez —to monitor terror groups in the region. Officials say most U.S. forces are based in the latter, which cost the U.S. $110 million to build, and began drone operations in 2019.


Niger’s natural resources have increased its importance to global powers, and Niger’s location had provided the U.S. with the ability to conduct counterterror operations throughout much of West Africa.


“We're in a different position now, and we're going to continue to consult with the Nigeriens in terms of the orderly withdrawal of U.S. forces. We're going to continue to stay engaged with the partners in the region when it comes to terrorism and countering the terrorist threat,” Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder told reporters on Tuesday.


Countries in the region, including Niger, Mali, Nigeria and Burkina Faso, have seen an expansive rise in jihadist movements. 


According to the Global Terrorism Index, an annual report covering terrorist incidents worldwide, more than half of the deaths caused by terrorism last year were in the Sahel. 


Niger’s neighbor, Burkina Faso, suffered the worst, with 1,907 fatalities from terrorism in 2023. 


“These are some of the most dangerous areas in the world,” Bill Roggio, editor of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies’ Long War Journal, told VOA. “These countries are in dire threat of being overrun by jihadist groups.”


Now, Niger’s coup has put the West’s ability to monitor terrorists like the Islamic State and al-Qaida in the Sahel in “complete disarray,” according to Roggio. 


The United States’ intelligence-gathering capacity was limited before, “but we're approaching the point where intelligence-gathering is practically at zero,” he said.


A U.S. defense official told VOA that “basically every flight,” even intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance drone flights, must be approved by the junta. 


“The beginning of April is when things started getting slower,” the official told VOA. The junta began delaying and canceling the types of U.S. military flights that had been quickly approved before then.


Carla Martinez Machain, a political science professor at the University of Buffalo, believes the Pentagon will try to negotiate with Chad for a more significant American troop presence, as the U.S. struggles to find allies in what she called the “coup belt” — a reference to the recent coups in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. 


However, most U.S. forces have temporarily left from Chad for Germany in recent weeks, a move the Pentagon called a "temporary step" as part of an ongoing review of its security cooperation with Chad, which would resume after the country’s May 6 presidential election. 


Only a small group of service members remain in Chad as part of a multinational task force, officials tell VOA.


“Niger was somewhat of a rarity in the sense that it had one of the few democratically elected governments in the region, and also a democratically elected government that was friendly to the U.S. and willing to host a U.S. military presence,” Martinez Machain told VOA. “And so, finding a replacement for that for a military base is going to be somewhat difficult.” 


Unless the U.S. can find another base to use in West Africa, counterterror drones will likely have to spend most of their fuel supply flying thousands of kilometers from U.S. bases in Italy or Djibouti, severely limiting their time over the targets and their ability to gather intelligence.


“The beauty of having drones based in Niger was that they were in the thick of the fight. They were in the middle of where jihadist groups are operating. So, once you launch the drones, they're in the midst of it, and all of the flight time being used can be used to gather information,” Roggio said.


Resupply concerns


Amid the negotiations and flight cancellations, U.S. troops in Niger began raising concerns about their supply chain. Service members in Niamey told the office of Representative Matt Gaetz that blood for the blood bank, hygiene supplies, malaria pills and other medications were running low. 


A U.S. defense official acknowledged to VOA that “they were concerned about medication levels.” The official also said that troops in Niamey had gone through April without a resupply flight but had received food and water supplies through ground-based transportation.


A flight with medical supplies finally went from Agadez to Niamey last week, the defense official told VOA.




Coup forced withdrawal


Tensions between the U.S. and Niger began in 2023 when Niger’s military junta removed the democratically elected president from power. 


After months of delay, the Biden administration formally declared in October that the military takeover in Niger was a coup, a determination that prevented Niger from receiving a significant amount of U.S. military and foreign assistance.


In March, after tense meetings between U.S. representatives and the CNSP, the junta called the U.S. military presence “illegal” and announced it was ending an agreement that allowed American forces to be based in the country.


During that meeting, the U.S. and Niger fundamentally disagreed about Niger’s desire to supply Iran with uranium and work more closely with Russian military forces.




“They [Niger] saw this as kind of an imperialistic move, and this was seen negatively and was part of the reason why the U.S. was told to leave the country,” Martinez Machain said.


Russia has made significant military inroads across the African continent, Martinez Machain added, because human rights violators are able to obtain military training, assistance and defense systems “without the conditions that the U.S. would attach them.”


“Especially for nondemocratic countries, this can seem very appealing,” she said.

## Fewer US overdose deaths reported last year, but experts still cautious

date: 2024-05-16, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — The number of fatal overdoses in the U.S. fell last year, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data posted Wednesday.


Agency officials noted that the data is provisional and could change after more analysis, and that they still expect a drop when the final counts are in. It would be only the second annual decline since the current national drug death epidemic began more than three decades ago.


Experts reacted cautiously. One described the decline as relatively small and said it should be thought of as part of a leveling off rather than a decrease. Another noted that the last time a decline occurred — in 2018 — drug deaths shot up in the years that followed.


"Any decline is encouraging," said Brandon Marshall, a Brown University researcher who studies overdose trends. "But I think it's certainly premature to celebrate or to draw any large-scale conclusions about where we may be headed long term with this crisis."


It's also too soon to know what spurred the decline, Marshall and other experts said. Explanations could include shifts in the drug supply, expansion of overdose prevention and addiction treatment, and the grim possibility that the epidemic has killed so many that now there are basically fewer people to kill.




CDC Chief Medical Officer Dr. Debra Houry called the dip "heartening news" and praised efforts to reduce the tally, but she noted that "there are still families and friends losing their loved ones to drug overdoses at staggering numbers."


About 107,500 people died of overdoses in the U.S. last year, including American citizens and noncitizens who were in the country at the time they died, the CDC estimated. That's down 3% from 2022, when there were an estimated 111,000 such deaths, the agency said.


The drug overdose epidemic, which has killed more than 1 million people since 1999, has had many ripple effects. For example, a study published last week in JAMA Psychiatry estimated that more than 321,000 U.S. children lost a parent to a fatal drug overdose from 2011 to 2021.


"These children need support" and are at a higher risk of mental health and drug use disorders themselves, said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which helped lead the study. "It's not just a loss of a person. It's also the implications that loss has for the family left behind."


Prescription painkillers once drove the nation's overdose epidemic, but they were supplanted years ago by heroin and more recently by illegal fentanyl. The dangerously powerful opioid was developed to treat intense pain from ailments such as cancer but has increasingly been mixed with other drugs in the illicit drug supply.


For years, fentanyl was frequently injected, but increasingly it's being smoked or mixed into counterfeit pills.


A study published last week found that law enforcement seizures of pills containing fentanyl are rising dramatically, jumping from 44 million in 2022 to more than 115 million last year.


It's possible that the seizures indicate that the overall supply of fentanyl-laced pills is growing fast, not necessarily that police are whittling down the illicit drug supply, said one of the paper's authors, Dr. Daniel Ciccarone of the University of California, San Francisco.


He noted that the decline in overdoses was not uniform. All but two of the states in the eastern half of the U.S. saw declines, but most Western states saw increases. Alaska, Washington and Oregon each saw 27% increases.


The reason? Many Eastern states have been dealing with fentanyl for about a decade, while it's reached Western states more recently, Ciccarone said.


Nevertheless, some researchers say there are reasons to be optimistic. It's possible that smoking fentanyl is not as lethal as injecting it, but scientists are still exploring that question.


Meanwhile, more money is becoming available to treat addiction and prevent overdoses, through government funding and legal settlements with drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies, Ciccarone noted.


"My hope is 2023 is the beginning of a turning point," he said.

## Qualcomm details Linux on Snapdragon X Elite, and it’s looking surprisingly good

date: 2024-05-16, from: OS News

With Qualcomm and Microsoft about to flood the market with devices using the new Snapdragon X Elite, those of us who don&#8217;t want to use Windows felt a bit uneasy &#8211; what&#8217;s Linux support going to look like for this new generation of ARM devices? Well, it seems Qualcomm&#8217;s been busy, and they&#8217;ve published a blog post detailing their work on Linux support for the X Elite. It’s been our priority not only to support Linux on our premium-tier SoCs, but to support it pronto. In fact, within one or two days of publicly announcing each generation of Snapdragon 8, we’ve posted the initial patchset for Linux kernel support. Snapdragon X Elite was no exception: we announced on October 23 of last year and posted the patchset the next day. That was the result of a lot of pre-announcement work to get everything up and running on Linux and Debian. ↫ Qualcomm&#8217;s developer blog In the blog post, the company details exactly which X Elite features have already been merged into mainline with Linux 6.8 and 6.9, as well as which features will be merged into mainline in Linux 6.10 and 6.11, and to be quite frank &#8211; it&#8217;s looking really solid, especially considering this is Qualcomm we&#8217;re talking about. Over the coming six months, they&#8217;re going to focus on getting end-to-end hardware video decoding working, including in Firefox and Chrome, as well as various CPU and GPU optimisations, adding the required firmware to the linux-firmware package, and providing access to easy installers. All in all, it&#8217;s looking like the X Elite will be exceptionally well supported by Linux before the year&#8217;s over. The blog post also details the boot path for Linux on the X Elite, and that, too, is looking good. It&#8217;s using a standard UEFI boot process, and supports GRUB and systemd-boot out of the box. Linux boots up using devicetrees, though, and apparently, there&#8217;s a known problem with using those that Qualcomm and the community are working on. We’re working closely with upstream communities on an open problem with the UEFI-based BIOS while booting with devicetrees. The problem is that, when you have more than one devicetree blob (DTB) packed into the firmware package flashed on the device, there is no standard way of selecting a devicetree to pass on to the kernel. OEMs commonly put multiple DTBs into the firmware package so it will support devices with slightly different SKUs, so we’re keen to solve this problem. ↫ Qualcomm&#8217;s developer blog I am pleasantly surprised by the openness and straightforwardness Qualcomm is showing the Linux community here, and I really hope this is a sign of how the company will keep supporting its laptop and possibly desktop-oriented SoCs from here on out. It seems like next year we will finally be getting competitive ARM laptops that can run Linux in a fully supported fashion.

## Android 15 beta 2 released

date: 2024-05-15, from: OS News

Google released Android 15 beta 2 today, and with it, they unveiled some more of the new features coming to Android later this year when the final release lands. Android 15 comes with something called a private space, an area with an extra layer of authentication where you can keep applications and data hidden away, such as banking applications or health data. It&#8217;s effectively a separate user profile, and shows up as a separate area in the application drawer when unlocked. When locked, it disappears entirely from sight, share sheets, and so on. Another awesome new feature is Theft Detection Lock, which uses Google &#8220;AI&#8221; to detect when a phone is snatched out of your hands by someone running, biking, or driving away, and instantly locks it. Theft like this is quite common in certain areas, and this seems like an excellent use of &#8220;AI&#8221; (i.e., accelerometer data) to discourage thieves from trying this. There&#8217;s also a bunch of smaller stuff, like custom vibration patterns per notification, giving applications partial access to only your most recent photos and videos, system-wide preferences for which gender you&#8217;d like to be addressed as in gendered languages (French gets this feature first), and a whole lot more. Developers also get a lot to play with here, from safer intents to something like ANGLE: Vulkan is Android&#8217;s preferred interface to the GPU. Therefore, Android 15 includes ANGLE as an optional layer for running OpenGL ES on top of Vulkan. Moving to ANGLE will standardize the Android OpenGL implementation for improved compatibility, and, in some cases, improved performance. You can test out your OpenGL ES app stability and performance with ANGLE by enabling the developer option in Settings -> System -> Developer Options -> Experimental: Enable ANGLE on Android 15. ↫ Android developer blog You can install Android 15 beta 2 on a number f Pixel devices and devices from other OEMs starting today. I installed it on my Pixel 8 Pro, and after a few hours I haven&#8217;t really noticed anything breaking, but that&#8217;s really not enough time to make any meaningful observations. Google also detailed Wear OS 5. Later this year, battery life optimizations are coming to watches with Wear OS 5. For example, running an outdoor marathon will consume up to 20% less power when compared to watches with Wear OS 4. And your fitness apps will be able to help improve your performance with the option to support more data types like ground contact time, stride length and vertical oscillation. ↫ Android developer blog Wear OS 5 will also improve the Watch Face Format with more complications, which is very welcome, because the selection of complications is currently rather meager. Wear OS 5 will also ship later this year.

## Armed with AI, adversaries will try to tilt US election, security officials warn

date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — America's foreign adversaries will again seek to influence the upcoming U.S. elections, top security officials warned members of the Senate on Wednesday, harnessing the latest innovations in artificial intelligence to spread online disinformation, mislead voters and undermine trust in democracy.


But the U.S. has greatly improved its ability to safeguard election security and identify and combat foreign disinformation campaigns since 2016, when Russia sought to influence the election, U.S. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee.


The latest warning from security officials came as advances in AI make it easier and cheaper than ever to create lifelike images, video and audio that can fool even the most discerning voter. Other tools of disinformation include state media, online influencers, and networks of fake accounts that can quickly amplify false and misleading content.


Russia, China and Iran remain the main actors looking to interfere with the 2024 election, security officials said, but because of advances in technology, other nations or even domestic groups could try to mount their own sophisticated disinformation campaigns.


Russia remains "the most active foreign threat to our elections," Haines said, using its state media and online influencers to try to erode trust in democratic institutions and U.S. support for Ukraine.


In recent months, Russia has seized on America's debate over immigration, spreading posts that exaggerate the impact of migration in an apparent effort to stoke outrage among American voters.


China did not directly try to influence the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, mostly because of concerns about blowback, Haines said.


China's ties to TikTok were one of the things cited by members of Congress who recently voted to force TikTok's Beijing-based owner to sell the platform.


"Needless to say, we will continue to monitor their activity," Haines said of China.


Iran, meanwhile, has used social media platforms to issue threats and try to confuse voters, Haines said. She cited a 2020 episode in which U.S. officials accused Tehran of distributing false content and being behind a flurry of emails sent to Democratic voters in multiple battleground states that appeared to be aimed at intimidating them into voting for President Donald Trump.


Wednesday's hearing on foreign threats to the election also covered the risk that an adversary could hack into state or local election systems, either to change the vote or to create the perception that the outcome can't be trusted.


Jen Easterly, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said the federal government has worked closely with state and local election officials to ensure the 2024 election is the most secure ever.


"Election infrastructure has never been more secure," Easterly said.

## Raspberry Pi officially announces intent to IPO

date: 2024-05-15, from: OS News

As expected earlier this year, Raspberry Pi is going public on the stock exchange in London. Back then, CEO Eben Upton said he did not expect the IPO to change how Raspberry Pi did things, but history tells us that initial public offerings tend to, well, change how companies do things. In their official announcement that they intend to hold an IPO, there&#8217;s an incredibly interesting and telling contradiction, as noted by @yassie_j on MastoAkkoma: Raspberry Pi, in their listing press release, says: The Enthusiast and Education market is the “heart” of the Raspberry Pi movement. But also says: Industrial and Embedded market  accounts  over 72 per cent So the heart seems to be going neglected, it seems, because there’s no way you’re going to not cash in on industrial applications. Especially when you’ve just done a big IPO. ↫ @yassie_j on Akkoma This exactly illustrates the fears we all have about what an IPO is going to mean for Raspberry Pi. It&#8217;s already become increasingly more difficult for enthusiasts to get their hands on the latest Raspberry Pi models, but once the IPO&#8217;s done and there&#8217;s shareholders breathing down their neck, that will most likely only get worse. If the industrial and embedded market is where you&#8217;re making most of your money, where do you think Raspberry Pi devices are going to end up? Luckily the market&#8217;s a lot bigger and more varied now than it was back when Raspberry Pi was new, so we have a wide variety of options to choose from. Still, I&#8217;m definitely worried about what Raspberry Pi, as a company, will look like five, ten years from now.

## Kennedy regarded as potential spoiler in US presidential election

date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA

white house — There are few things the presidential campaigns of Donald Trump and Joe Biden agree on. One is the presidential candidacy of activist-lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Both the Biden and Trump camps see Kennedy as a potential spoiler in this November's election.


About half of registered voters have told pollsters that if given the chance, they would replace both Biden and Trump on this year's ballot.


"If you picture what this country is going to look like in November if either President Trump or President Biden won, the division is going to continue," Kennedy said at a California campaign event to introduce his running mate, 38-year-old attorney and philanthropist Nicole Shanahan. "The anger, the vitriol, the chaos, the polarization is going to worsen. The only way to end that is through my successful candidacy."


Neither Kennedy nor Shanahan has ever held elective office.


Kennedy's father was Robert F. Kennedy, a former U.S. attorney general and a senator, and a major contender in the 1968 Democratic Party presidential primary until he was assassinated. His uncle was President John F. Kennedy, slain while in office in 1963.


"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is not going to be the next president," predicts Georgetown University Associate Professor Hans Noel, echoing the consensus of his fellow political scientists.


What worries the Biden and Trump campaigns is the possibility of Kennedy on the ballot in the half-dozen or so swing states where his mere thousands of votes could "change the outcome of that state. Then of course, that tips the direction of that state — if that state is large enough — and the ultimate election is fairly close, which is what we expect. Then, it could change the outcome of the race," Noel tells VOA.


During a recent appearance on MSNBC, Kennedy declared "I'm going to be on the ballot in every state. I'll be on the ballot in every state by July."




Kennedy's team declined VOA's request to make the candidate or a surrogate available to respond to questions, saying "the campaign has decided to only grant interviews to U.S press with targeted U.S. audiences at this time."


The Kennedy clan "is not happy at all that he's running, and they've made a number of efforts to make that very clear," notes Noel.


Biden, during a recent campaign appearance in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, was surrounded by Kennedy family members, including the independent candidate's sister, Kerry Kennedy, who said "We want to make crystal clear our feeling that the best way forward for America is to reelect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to four more years."


Candidate Kennedy's beliefs about vaccines, the origins of COVID-19, and the assassinations of his father and uncle have attracted some supporters, including those who said they previously voted for Trump or Biden.


In recent weeks, Kennedy attracted the most media attention not for his positions on any political issue but for a revelation from a 2012 deposition for a divorce. In it, he said cognitive issues that had harmed his earning potential could have been "caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died."


In a social media post after the brain worm wriggled into the headlines across the country, Kennedy quipped, "I offer to eat 5 more brain worms and still beat President Trump and President Biden in a debate."




Political pundits are split on whether Kennedy poses more of a threat to Trump or Biden.


"Kennedy is much more popular among Republicans than he is among Democrats right now. But that's probably mostly because he's a Democrat or former Democrat who says bad things about other Democrats," said Noel. "And, so, Republicans like to hear that, and they think that sounds interesting. But they're not going to vote for that over Donald Trump."


The Republican National Committee, attempting to dissuade conservatives who oppose abortion from considering Kennedy as an alternative to Trump, stated, "There is exactly zero daylight between the abortion extremism of RFK Jr. and Crooked Joe Biden."


The Democratic National Committee filed a complaint against Kennedy in February with the Federal Election Commission alleging a political action committee was illegally coordinating with the independent candidate's campaign to get him on additional state ballots.


Biden's party also portrays Kennedy as a "spoiler for Donald Trump," according to Matt Corridoni, a DNC spokesperson.


"RFK Jr.'s campaign isn't building a plan or a strategy to get 270 electoral votes. They're building one to help Trump return to the Oval Office," he says.


The New York Times calls Kennedy the "X factor" in this year's presidential election, noting that the latest public opinion survey, organized by the newspaper The Philadelphia Inquirer and Siena College, shows him polling stronger than any third-party candidate in decades. The poll has Kennedy being supported by about 10% of registered voters in the battleground states, drawing equally from both Biden and Trump.

## Curation, search, and the future of the web

date: 2024-05-15, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>Google I/O 2024 is underway and a bunch of articles came out about what Google's changes to its core product (search) mean for the web as a whole. Sean Hollister at The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24074314/google-now-offers-web-search">has a piece on the new “web” search option</a> (a piece that starts with <em>“This is not a joke”</em>) while Casey Newton wrote a  nice articled titled <a href="https://www.platformer.news/google-io-ai-search-sundar-pichai/">“Google’s broken link to the web”</a>.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly Google has revealed that AI is going to be integrated pretty much everywhere, and the goal is to let the AI do the googling for you. Which sounds great, in theory. After all, as the fine people at The Browser Company have eloquently explained to the world, the web is in such a terrible state that the only way out of this madness is to let an AI deal with all the garbage and spammy content that’s out there. I already <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/a-rant-on-arc-search">expressed my doubts about this plan</a> and I don’t think what Google is doing is any better.</p>
<p>Google, as a company, is in an odd position. They are, fundamentally, an advertising company. Almost 70% of their revenues are generated by ads. Ads on the SERP, ads on their various products and ads served by their ad network on 3rd party websites. When they say that they’re going to do the googling for you they don’t just mean the search part. In theory, AI will also go find the information you’re looking for on 3rd party sites so they’ll do the googling but also the actual browsing. Did you spot the issue? How are people going to consume ads on 3rd party sites if you no longer need to visit 3rd party sites? And if AI is going to take over the entire top part of the SERP with its generated answer, why should companies pay Google to appear at the top of the search results if those search results are not going to be seen by the majority of people?</p>
<p>It’s a bizarre situation. The answer to missing ad revenues is obviously going to be more ads. I’m sure Google will figure out a way to inject ads into their AI-generated bullshit.</p>
<p>Some people are obviously freaking out about the recent news. That’s because a huge number of sites out there rely on Google to bring traffic to their websites, sites that are then monetised via ads in most cases. If traffic goes down, ad revenues go down. And that’s a bad thing, right? Right? Well, maybe? I guess it depends. The current state of the web is unsustainable. And maybe AI and AI-generated garbage is what we need to push the current situation over the edge and force some changes.</p>
<p>I think curation, actual human curation, is going to play an important role in the future. In a web filled with generated nonsense, content curated by knowledgeable human beings is going to be incredibly valuable.</p>
<p>I find this current phase of the web incredibly interesting. I have no idea how things will evolve but I’m glad I can be part of it, even just as an external observer.</p>                <hr>

## NetBSD bans use of Copilot-generated code

date: 2024-05-15, from: OS News

The NetBSD project seems to agree with me that code generated by &#8220;AI&#8221; like Copilot is tainted, and cannot be used safely. The project&#8217;s added a new guideline banning the use of code generated by such tools from being added to NetBSD unless explicitly permitted by &#8220;core&#8220;, NetBSD&#8217;s equivalent, roughly, of &#8220;technical management&#8221;. Code generated by a large language model or similar technology, such as such as GitHub/Microsoft&#8217;s Copilot, OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT, or Facebook/Meta&#8217;s Code Llama, is presumed to be tainted code, and must not be committed without prior written approval by core. ↫ NetBSD Commit Guidelines GitHub Copilot is copyright infringement and open source license violation at an industrial scale, and as I keep reiterating &#8211; the fact Microsoft is not training Copilot on its own closed-source code tells you all you need to know about what Microsoft thinks about the legality of Copilot.

## The U.S. Oil Industry Is Full of Hypocrites

date: 2024-05-15, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjI1MjQ0NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NTk1MDEzMH0.NqWvZ3tEugFLr5zxl3k5cv0gZ-Y8d-8Uo7_7Uf3mWgE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">The Federal Trade Commission earlier this month threw sand in the gears of one of several big oil company deals currently in the works, the $60 billion acquisition of shale oil company Pioneer by Exxon. While the FTC didn’t block the sale, it said that Pioneer’s chief executive, Scott Sheffield, could not join Exxon’s board, as proposed in the merger agreement, because of his role in seeking to coordinate oil production and push up prices. </p><p>It was yet another Rorschach test of the <a href="https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.768" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mid-transition</u></a> — oil folk saw regulator overreach or pettiness under a Democratic administration, while climate campaigners saw shameless profiteering by the oil industry. What it really reveals is more complex: The illusion of laissez-faire oil markets; the disingenuousness (if not hypocrisy) of the U.S. oil industry; and the need for U.S. policymakers to take a much more interventionist stance in oil markets. </p><p>First, the FTC complaint. Sheffield, fêted in the oil world as one of the key instigators of the U.S. shale oil boom, has called on peers in the sector to refrain from drilling when prices were low. The commission also quoted public remarks by Sheffield referring to U.S. oil companies “staying in line,” being disciplined in their production, and being punished by shareholders if they sought to grow production. </p><p>He went further than that, though, according to the FTC. In a heavily redacted section of the complaint, the Commission describes Sheffield meeting with OPEC officials and communicating with them by WhatsApp. “If Texas leads the way, maybe we can get OPEC to cut production. Maybe Saudi and Russia will follow. That was our plan,”<em> </em>he said in one <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/05/ftc-order-bans-former-pioneer-ceo-exxon-board-seat-exxon-pioneer-deal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>text message</u></a> cited by the Commission. He added: “I was using the tactics of OPEC+ to get a bigger OPEC+ done.” Pioneer <a href="https://investors.pxd.com/investors/news-releases/news-details/2024/Pioneer-Natural-Resources-Responds-to-FTC-Settlement-Complaint-Filed-as-Part-of-Approval-of-Proposed-Transaction-with-ExxonMobil/default.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>issued a statement</u></a> saying that circumventing competition rules was “neither the intent nor the effect” of Sheffield’s comments and pointing to Pioneer’s role in increasing U.S. production. </p><p>Coordinating on prices, however, is the norm in the history of oil markets — even in the U.S. It shouldn’t be so shocking that the purportedly free market-loving oil industry would engage in this kind of behavior. </p><p>A lot of Sheffield’s activity mentioned by the FTC took place from around 2020 to 2023, when oil demand was still uncertain thanks to Covid. Even before then, the U.S. shale industry, which had boomed through the late 2010s, was under pressure from institutional investors, frustrated as all the new supply undermined their profits. Exxon, whose antecedent Rockefeller famously took control of transport to manage the oil market, is so big and cash-rich that it can largely ride out market fluctuations; the smaller and newer shale oil producers, reliant on increasingly impatient investors, could not.</p><p>No wonder Sheffield was vocal about restricting supply: He had a large company and a high profile among a sea of smaller players that were fracking madly even as prices fell. </p><p>Oil prices are notoriously volatile, which serves neither producers nor consumers. If prices are too low, the industry logic goes, no-one invests. Too high, and there’s a risk that demand for the stuff falls — especially if it prompts a recession. To keep prices in a sweet spot, a good chunk of the market has to be prepared to refrain from pumping. Turning the taps on and off is a role that Saudi Arabia and fellow OPEC petrostates have taken for decades. The nature of shale oil means it is a “swing producer” that can switch up and down its output with relative ease compared to other producers. </p><p>The market dynamics changed quickly when Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022. Since then, U.S. oil producers have been pumping more than ever, to the point where the country is now the world’s biggest producer. None of this has stopped the industry from continuing to loathe the Biden administration, of course. (Sheffield himself <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c21eb656-8d09-45ce-a13a-7d8419426b05" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said in 2021</u></a> that the administration was trying “to slow down U.S. drilling in any way they can.”) </p><p>The U.S. government is the one actor with enough power to influence global oil <em><em>demand</em></em> that has largely sat on its hands. The oil industry often engages in a kind of collective delayed gratification to keep oil prices in a sweet spot: high enough to maximize profits, but not so high that households and businesses start cutting back on their fuel use. Far less effort has gone into a kind of reverse strategy. There have been few attempts to reduce supply without disruptive price volatility — the kind of government inaction that pits voters against lawmakers and hurts households that really feel the pinch from higher gasoline prices.</p><p>Having intervened extensively in the preceding decades, during the 1980s, the U.S. government backed away from the complex price controls of the Nixon presidency and the demand-curtailing measures of Carter’s. With OPEC’s strategy being fairly straightforward, a couple of decades of relative stability followed, along with the assumption that the market would self-correct whenever prices went too high for consumers or too low for producers. Bassam Fattouh of Oxford Institute for Energy Studies argued that it was the perception of a self-correcting supply-demand dynamic that “stabilized long term expectations about oil prices”<em> </em>in that period. </p><p>The “mid-transition” idea, developed by academics Emily Grubert and Sara Hastings-Simon in a 2022 paper, asserts that the process of decarbonization involves a drawn-out, messy, liminal phase, during which changes to energy costs and supply will shape a society’s perception of clean energy so much that negative experiences like price spikes or supply interruptions will undermine political support for the transition. </p><p>In 2023, the Biden administration broke the U.S. government’s longstanding precedent and began intervening in oil prices with an eye beyond manipulating the immediate consumer price. It announced a target price for buying several hundred million barrels of oil to restock the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which had been depleted after the invasion of Ukraine sent prices spiking. By pledging to buy crude whenever the price was between $67 and $72 a barrel, it would do what Employ America, a think tank, had <a href="https://www.employamerica.org/researchreports/contingent-supply-maximizing-crude-how-the-spr-can-incentivize-additional-domestic-production/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>proposed</u></a>: Set a floor under prices that would help U.S. producers, as well as a ceiling that would avoid pain at the pump. </p><p>“Mid-transition” is a relatively new concept, but it harks back to a more established phrase in climate policy: “smooth transition,” which describes a pathway to decarbonization that is steady but not disruptive. Stimulating or restraining oil production in a way that <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/oil-companies-are-preparing-for-a-lucrative-decline" target="_blank">stabilizes oil investment and prices</a> — if done effectively and with the right intentions — is a necessary condition for such smoothness. Sheffield and other producers, including OPEC+ members, have for decades sought to manage oil supply to ensure that price spikes don’t disrupt oil’s future. For all that the U.S. oil industry castigates the Biden administration, they are actually pursuing the same goal, just with a different view of the end game. </p>

## Biochar Is Dominating the Carbon Removal Market — But No One Seems to Care

date: 2024-05-15, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjIwODg4My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMjU2MjgyMH0.XQeZBTOdfrVJX_lCXBnHrBAM_SK6wxJRFiiSiZAPlOs/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Low-tech carbon removal is all the rage these days. Whether it’s <a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-4-enhanced-rock-weathering" target="_self"><u>spreading crushed rocks on fields</u></a> or <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/vaulted-deep-carbon-removal" target="_self"><u>injecting sludgy biomass underground</u></a>, relatively simplistic solutions have seen a boom in funding. But there’s one cheap, nature-based method that hasn’t been able to drum up as much attention from big name climate investors: biochar. </p><p>This flaky, charcoal-like substance has been produced and used as a fertilizer for millennia, and its potential to lock up the carbon contained in organic matter is well-documented. It’s made by heating up biomass such as wood or plants in a low-oxygen environment via a process called pyrolysis, thereby sequestering up to 40% to 50% of the carbon contained within that organic matter for hundreds or (debatably — but we’ll get to that) even thousands of years. Ideally, the process utilizes waste biomass such as plant material and forest residue left over from harvesting crops or timber, which otherwise might just be burned. </p><p>The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says biochar could store about <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport.pdf" target="_blank">2.6 billion metric tons</a> of CO2 per year. And by some metrics, this ancient method of carbon removal is already leagues ahead of the rest. Last year, biochar accounted for 94% of all carbon dioxide removal credits that were actually fulfilled, <a href="https://www.cdr.fyi/blog/2023-year-in-review" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according to CDR.fyi</u></a>, which tracks the CO2 removal market. That means that while corporate buyers are purchasing carbon credits that use an array of different removal methods, biochar has thus far dominated the market when it comes to actually making good on these purchases.</p><p>Some of the largest corporate buyers of CO2 removal credits have biochar in their portfolios. Microsoft, by far the most prominent player in this space, has bought over 200,000 tons of biochar credits — part of its quest to become <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>carbon negative</u></a> by 2050 — although that’s still a mere fraction of the over 6.6 million tons of CO2 removal the company has bought overall. JPMorgan Chase, which aims to match every ton of its operational emissions with carbon dioxide removal credits by 2030, has bought nearly 19,000 tons of biochar credits, representing about 26% of its CO2 removal portfolio. </p><p>But despite its technical maturity, biochar has yet to generate the same level of excitement or venture capital investment as more complex methods of carbon removal such as direct air capture, which <a href="https://www.cdr.fyi/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fdiob2hk5%2Fposts%2F3d77c407e2bfe33ea933979e0873d9b962c30aa0-1240x1282.png&w=1920&q=75" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>garnered $142 million in investment last year</u></a>. By comparison, biochar companies raised a cumulative total of $74 million in 2023. While that’s no small change, it doesn’t compare to the amount of capital VCs and other climate tech funders have poured even into other similarly elemental carbon removal technologies. </p><p>For example, Frontier, a collaborative fund for tech companies to catalyze emerging solutions in this space, recently announced a $58 million deal with Vaulted Deep, a startup that injects wet biomass from food waste to poop deep underground. And at the end of last year, Frontier inked a $57 million deal with Lithos Carbon, a company pursuing enhanced rock weathering. This involves spreading crushed up rocks onto fields, which react with the CO2 in the air to form bicarbonate; that’s eventually carried out to sea, where the carbon remains permanently sequestered on the ocean floor. In other words, it’s just an acceleration of the natural weathering process, which normally takes hundreds of thousands of years. VCs backing Lithos include mainstream names like Union Square Ventures, Greylock Ventures, and Bain Capital Ventures, while big-time climate tech VC Lowercarbon Capital led Vaulted Deep’s seed round. </p><p>The questions around biochar’s durability — that is, how long it can actually lock away carbon — are potentially unanswerable, and that’s at least partially driving investor reticence. </p><p>“Biochar falls in this very interesting middle ground - you create it, and then it is constantly degrading,” Freya Chay, program lead at CarbonPlan, a nonprofit that analyzes different carbon removal pathways, told me. She said that we just don’t have the scientific know-how “to predict, really clearly, how much is going to still be in your soil at 100 years or at 1,000 years.” </p><p>Frontier, for its part, only considers carbon removal “permanent” if it can sequester carbon for at least 1,000 years. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166516223002276" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Some studies indicate</a> that a large proportion of biochar can achieve this, but it’s hard to definitively prove, and we’re far from a scientific consensus. Thus far the fund has steered clear of investing in biochar, <a href="https://gaps.frontierclimate.com/gap-details?recordId=recsPU8VIjuOO7LK3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>noting that detailed protocols must be developed</u></a> to measure its durability under a variety of soil and weather conditions.</p><p>Measurement, reporting and verification is often the downfall for nature-based solutions (see: the hoopla around <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bogus forest carbon credits</u></a>). And while it <em><em>is</em></em> simple to measure how much of the carbon in biomass ends up sequestered in biochar, “it's where you draw the project boundaries in terms of where the MRV falls apart,” Annie Nichols, director of operations and project management at Pacific Biochar told me. For example, one might want to ensure that trees aren’t being cut down or crops aren’t being grown just for the purpose of creating biochar, and this often falls outside the scope of traditional measurement protocols. Pacific Biochar, for its part, sources its waste biomass from forests in high fire risk areas of California, where the excessive accumulation of woody debris poses a danger. </p><p>Pacific Biochar <a href="https://www.cdr.fyi/leaderboards" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ranks as the world’s third largest supplier</u></a> of carbon removal, with over 28,000 tons of credits delivered. Biochar “got a lot of attention before there was actually much utility,” its CEO, Josiah Hunt told me, referring to the period in the late 2000s when Al Gore was heavily hyping its benefits. In his 2009 book “Our Choice,” Gore called biochar “one of the most exciting new strategies for restoring carbon to depleted soils, and sequestering significant amounts of CO2 for 1,000 years and more.” But at that time, Hunt said, “There weren't really carbon markets ready to work with it yet.” </p><p>Prior to 2020, Pacific Biochar’s revenue relied solely on biochar fertilizer sales to farmers. It was only when the carbon credits market picked up that the company was able to scale. Today, Pacific Biochar sells most of its credits directly, as opposed to on an independent exchange, though it works with the carbon credits platform Carbonfuture to deliver credits to customers and perform the necessary verification to ensure the company’s carbon removal data is accurate. </p><p>Pacific Biochar’s credits sell for $180 per metric ton, cheaper than nearly all other removal methods and far below the weighted average of $488 for CO2 removal. That’s because producing biochar via pyrolysis requires much less energy than something like direct air capture. It’s also a more mature process than most emergent nature-based solutions such as enhanced rock weathering, meaning that comparably less money needs to be spent demonstrating that the process works as intended. </p><p>A number of biochar companies told me they think biochar has been overlooked in favor of more novel technological solutions. “There's this fixation on trying to find the high tech solution, the SaaS app that's going to solve climate change,” Thor Kallestad, CEO and cofounder of Myno Carbon, told me. By comparison, biochar can seem like a relic of an earlier era that never quite reached its potential. </p><p>Myno, founded by oil and gas veterans, is self-funding the buildout of a large-scale biochar and electricity co-generation facility in Port Angeles, Washington, which will source its fuel from the copious timber waste in Washington State. It’s still in the initial design phase, but the ultimate goal is to produce about 70,000 tons of biochar per year alongside 20 megawatts of power. That amounts to about 100,000 carbon dioxide removal credits, which Kallestad hopes to sell for less than $100 per metric ton. Ideally, he said, the plant will serve as a proof of concept that will help drive future investments.</p><p>While there haven’t yet been any major scandals in the biochar-sourcing world, the BBC ran an exposé in 2022 on a biomass-fueled <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-63089348" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>power station in the UK</u></a> that was logging old-growth forests to create wood pellets that were then burned for power. The company, Drax, had previously claimed that it was only sourcing sawdust and waste wood. While Drax maintains that its biomass is “sustainable and legally harvested,” <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68381160" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>further reporting indicates</u></a> that as of last year, the company was still sourcing from old-growth forests. The worry is that something similar could happen with biochar production as demand ramps up. </p><p>Chay says the cost-benefit analysis for making biochar gets even thornier when taking into account the “counterfactual of how we otherwise could have used biomass.” After all, biomass can also be burned for energy, and if the emissions are captured and stored, that’s a carbon removal strategy too. And with many looking towards biomass-based fuels as a way to decarbonize industries such as aviation and shipping, demand for waste biomass appears set to increase alongside uncertainty regarding its best use case. “Zooming forward to 2050, I'm not sure there is anything such as waste biomass,” Chay told me.</p><p>But in the short-term at least, there’s enough to go around. <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/bioenergy/2023-billion-ton-report-assessment-us-renewable-carbon-resources" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>A recent Department of Energy</u></a> report noted that “available but unused” biomass such as logging and agricultural residue could contribute around 350 tons to the nation’s supply every year. That’s about as much biomass as the United States uses for bioenergy today </p><p>“Certainly biochar has a place,” Chay said. She’s not convinced that it will ever make sense to conceptualize biochar production as “permanent carbon removal” though. “Maybe we just let it be this kind of interstitial durability. We figure out how to value that while also optimizing for agricultural co-benefits.”</p><p>Investors may remain wary of a solution that occupies this hard-to-define space between short and long-term CO2 removal, but Hunt’s not too worried. “I don’t think that’s horribly detrimental,” he told me. He sees biochar’s strong performance in the carbon credits marketplace as enough to sustain the industry for now. “I do think the buying community is what drives our growth. And even if we’re not the unicorns, even if we’re just the work mules, that’s fine with me. I don’t mind being the mule of climate change action.” </p>

## Jury chosen for US Senator Menendez's corruption trial

date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — A jury was chosen on Wednesday to determine whether U.S. Senator Robert Menendez broke the law in what federal prosecutors have called a yearslong bribery scheme to benefit the governments of Egypt and Qatar, as well as himself. 


Opening statements in the trial of New Jersey's senior senator are expected to begin later in the day before U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein in Manhattan. The trial could last into early July. 


Twelve jurors and six alternates were chosen, including an investment banker, a commercial litigator, a retired economist, a doctor and multiple therapists. Jury selection took about 2½, and more than 130 prospective jurors were excused. 


Menendez, 70, faces 16 criminal charges including bribery, fraud, acting as a foreign agent and obstruction. 


He is being tried alongside New Jersey businessmen Wael Hana and Fred Daibes. The senator's wife, Nadine Menendez, 57, is scheduled to be tried on July 8, with the delay resulting from what her lawyers called a serious medical condition. 


All the defendants have pleaded not guilty. The bribery trial is the senator's second. His first ended in 2017 in a mistrial after jurors deadlocked. 


Prosecutors are expected to detail what they consider a complex and sordid array of corruption that lasted from 2018 to 2023. 


The Menendezes are accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from Hana, Daibes and insurance broker Jose Uribe, in exchange for the senator's providing political favors and aid to Egypt and Qatar.  


Prosecutors have said the senator promised to help Egypt obtain arms sales and other aid, helped Hana obtain a lucrative monopoly on certifying that meat exports to Egypt conformed to Islamic law, and tried to help Daibes secure millions of dollars from a Qatari investment fund. 


Menendez, a Democrat, also was accused of trying to interfere in a federal criminal case against Daibes in New Jersey and in state criminal cases involving two of Uribe's associates. 


Prosecutors have said FBI agents found more than $480,000 of cash in the Menendezes' home, much stashed in clothing, closets and a safe. 


Bribes also included more than $100,000 in gold bars and a $60,000 Mercedes-Benz convertible, according to prosecutors. 


Uribe pleaded guilty in March to bribery and fraud, and he agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. 


While Nadine Menendez is not yet on trial, her husband's lawyers have suggested his defense might include an effort to blame her for withholding information and making him believe his activities were lawful. 


Robert Menendez became a senator in 2006. Before being indicted, he would have been favored in his Democratic-leaning state to win a fourth full Senate term in November. 


But any reelection bid now would be a long shot, reflecting recent polls of voters that show overwhelming disapproval of Menendez's job performance. 


Menendez has suggested that he would try if acquitted to run as an independent. Only 9% of voters polled in March by Emerson College Polling/PIX11/The Hill said they would prefer him to another Democrat or a Republican. 


The senator has resisted calls to resign made from across the political spectrum but gave up leadership of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee after his indictment last September. 


Stein admonished jurors to ignore media coverage of the trial. "If something comes up," the judge said, "switch off."

## US imposes sanctions on Nicaragua over repression, migrant smuggling

date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The United States on Wednesday imposed visa restrictions on more than 250 members of the Nicaraguan government and levied sanctions on three Nicaraguan entities in retaliation for "repressive actions" and a failure to stem migrant smuggling through the Central American country.


Senior administration officials told reporters that the officials subject to visa restrictions included police and paramilitary officials, prosecutors, judges and public higher education officials.


At the same time, the Departments of State, Homeland Security, and the Treasury issued a joint alert to notify airlines and travel agents about the ways smuggling and human trafficking networks are exploiting legitimate transportation services to facilitate illegal migration to the United States through Nicaragua.




"Actions by the Nicaraguan government are of grave concern. President Daniel Ortega and Vice President Rosario Murillo have put in place permissive-by-design migration policies," the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement.


The Nicaraguan government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


Increasingly migrants have been flying into Nicaragua and then heading north overland to the U.S.-Mexico border as some smugglers have promoted the route through social networks.




Many migrants in recent years have started their journeys in Brazil or other South American countries, but flying into Nicaragua avoids the often perilous journey through the jungle region known as the Darien Gap on the Colombia-Panama border.


The administration of President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has struggled with record numbers of migrant crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border and, as he runs for reelection in November, voters have increasingly said that immigration is a top concern.


Senior Biden administration officials told reporters on a Wednesday conference call that sanctions would be levied against a Russian training center operating in Managua since October 2017 that enabled anti-democratic behavior and repression.


A press release from the Treasury Department said Nicaragua was one of Russia's "main partners" in Central America and the training center provided specialized courts to the Nicaraguan National Police (NNP), which the statement called "a repressive state apparatus, carrying out extrajudicial killings, using live ammunition against peaceful protests, and even participating in death squads."


In addition, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on two gold companies it said were "government affiliated."


Gold is Nicaragua's top commodity export, the Treasury announcement said, and "this action aims to degrade the ability of the Ortega-Murillo regime to manipulate the sector and profit." Reuters was not immediately able to reach the companies for comment.


Migrant apprehensions on the border halved from December to March, according to U.S. government data, in part because of increased enforcement by Mexican authorities, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has said.

## US slaps sanctions on Sudan paramilitary commanders over Darfur offensive

date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on two commanders of Sudan's paramilitary force, vowing pressure to stop the unit from an offensive on the Darfur city of el-Fasher.


The Treasury Department said it was freezing any U.S. assets and criminalizing transactions with Ali Yagoub Gibril, Central Darfur commander of the Rapid Support Forces, and an RSF major general involved in operational planning, Osman Mohamed Hamid Mohamed.


"The RSF military operation to encircle and besiege el-Fasher, North Darfur, has endangered the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians," State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement.


"We stand ready to take additional measures against those individuals and institutions that actively escalate the war — including any offensive actions on el-Fasher," he said.


U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday also voiced alarm over reports of heavy fighting in densely populated areas as the RSF seeks control of el-Fasher, the last major city in Darfur not under its control.


Tens of thousands of people have died, and millions have been displaced since war broke out in April 2023 between Sudan's army and the RSF after their head generals refused a plan to integrate.


The United States has led diplomatic efforts to stop the fighting but has seen limited success and leverage, with RSF commanders unlikely to hold major assets in the West affected by sanctions.


The RSF and Sudan's armed forces are seen as both wanting to secure a battleground victory, and each side has received support from outside players.


The U.S. special envoy for Sudan, Tom Perriello, is again traveling around the Middle East and Africa this week in hopes of making progress.


The United States has accused both sides of war crimes and charged that the RSF has carried out ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity against the indigenous African-origin people of Darfur.


The RSF's predecessor, the Janjaweed militia, carried out a scorched-earth campaign in the arid western region that the United States at the time described as genocide.

## GNOME OS is switching from OSTree to systemd-sysupdate

date: 2024-05-15, from: OS News

I&#8217;m pretty sure most of you are familiar with KDE Neon, the distribution KDE maintains to provide easy access to the latest KDE technologies. However, did you know GNOME has something similar, called GNOME OS? It&#8217;s been around for a while, but has a far lower profile than KDE Neon does, and it seems they want to change that and put more of a spotlight on GNOME OS. GNOME OS is an immutable distribution using OSTree, the same technology used by the various popular immutable versions from the Fedora family. It seems GNOME OS is working to leave OSTree behind, and move to systemd-sysupdate instead, which has been available since systemd 251, released in May 2022. The developers claim this will bring the following benefits: To complete the move from OSTree to systemd-sysupdate, a few things need to be completed. First, the boot process and root filesystem had to be migrated, which was done last year. Second, sysupdate needs to integrated into GNOME, as for now, you can only use it via the command line. This work is ongoing, and requires a new D-Bus service and polkit integration to allow GNOME Software to manage the update process. Of course, there&#8217;s more work that needs to be done to complete this migration, but these are the main tasks. All of this work is part of the project&#8217;s goal to make GNOME OS nightlies viable for daily-driving for quality assurance purposes, and I&#8217;m sure all this work will also make GNOME OS more attractive to people outside of the developer community. It&#8217;s basically GNOME/systemd taken to the extreme, and while that will surely make quite a few people groan, I personally find it great that this will make GNOME OS a more capable choice for everyone. That&#8217;s what open source is all about, in the end.

## US will send an unofficial delegation as Taiwan's president is sworn in

date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The White House will send an unofficial delegation to Taiwan this weekend for the inauguration of the island's democratically elected president, the Biden administration announced Wednesday, in a move that is certain to upset China but unlikely to draw excessive responses from Beijing as the two countries try to stabilize relations.


A senior White House official said the move is in line with longstanding U.S. practice to send the delegation — which includes two former senior officials and a scholar — to the inauguration ceremony Monday. Lai Ching-te of the Democratic Progressive Party will take office, succeeding Tsai Ing-wen of the same party.


Beijing, which sees Taiwan as part of Chinese territory and vows to seize the island by force if necessary to achieve unification, sees Lai as a supporter of Taiwan's independence and has long opposed any official contact between Washington and Taipei.


"In what ways the U.S. deals with the new Taiwan authorities on May 20 and afterwards will affect (the) cross-Strait situation and also the China-U.S. relations in the future," Liu Pengyu, spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said Tuesday before the announcement, referring to the Taiwan Strait.


"So we urge the U.S. side to act on President Biden's commitment of not supporting Taiwan independence," he said.


The U.S. delegation will be in Taipei "to represent the American people," the White House official told reporters on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the trip before it was announced. The official called Taiwan "a model for democracy not only in the region but also globally."


Despite an absence of formal relations with Taiwan, the U.S. is the island's strongest ally and is obligated under a 1979 law to help Taiwan protect itself from invasion.


It's unclear how Beijing would respond to an unofficial U.S. delegation at the Taiwanese inauguration, but "Beijing will be the provocateur should it choose to respond with additional military pressure or coercion," the U.S. official said, adding that the administration is not predicting how China would respond.


Beijing has repeatedly warned Washington not to meddle with Taiwan's affairs, which it says are a core interest for China because it is a matter of sovereignty and territorial integrity. Beijing sees Washington's support for Taiwan as provocative.


The U.S. insists any differences be resolved peacefully and opposes any unilateral changes by either side to the status quo. "We do not support Taiwan independence," the administration official said. "We support cross-Strait dialogue."


Taiwan has topped the agenda in U.S.-China relations, which have soured over issues ranging from trade, cybersecurity and human rights to spying. The Biden administration, in its competition with China, has engaged in "intense diplomacy" aimed at preventing tensions from spiraling out of control.


Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have recently visited China in the administration's latest effort to keep communications open and minimize misunderstanding.


Shortly after Lai was elected in January, President Joe Biden sent an unofficial delegation to Taipei to meet Lai, drawing protests from Beijing. Members of Congress also have traveled to Taiwan to meet the president-elect. Plans are underway for a congressional delegation to visit Taiwan shortly after the inauguration.


Beijing reiterated its claim over Taiwan immediately after Lai was elected and said "the basic fact that Taiwan is part of China will not change." Days later, Nauru, a tiny Pacific nation, severed its diplomatic ties with Taiwan, which now is recognized by 12 governments, including the Vatican.


Since then, Beijing has criticized a U.S. destroyer's passage through the Taiwan Strait. The U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet said the USS Halsey "conducted a routine Taiwan Strait transit on May 8 through waters where high-seas freedoms of navigation and overflight apply in accordance with international law."


Navy Senior Capt. Li Xi, speaking for China's Eastern Theater Command, accused the U.S. of having "publicly hyped" the passage of the ship and said the command "organized naval and air forces to monitor" the ship's transit.


Meanwhile, in a push to avoid Taiwan's global recognition, Beijing said this week that it would not agree to Taiwan's participation in this year's World Health Assembly, an annual meeting by the World Health Organization that could boost Taiwan's visibility on the world stage.


"China's Taiwan region, unless given approval by the central government, has no basis, reason or right to participate in the World Health Assembly," said Wang Wenbin, speaking for the Chinese foreign ministry.


Wang also said Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party, which came into power in 2016, has been "hellbent on the separatist stance" of Taiwan's independence and that Beijing has "sufficient reason and a solid legal basis" to bar Taiwan from the global organization.


Here's the bipartisan delegation that the White House is sending to Taiwan this weekend:


— Laura Rosenberger, chair of the American Institute in Taiwan, a nonprofit, private corporation established under a 1979 law to manage America's unofficial relations with Taiwan.


— Brian Deese, a former director of the National Economic Council in the Biden administration.


— Richard Armitage, a former deputy secretary of state under President George W. Bush.


— Richard Bush, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who previously served as chair of the American Institute in Taiwan.

## Google now offers ‘web’ search — and an “AI” opt-out button

date: 2024-05-15, from: OS News

This is not a joke: Google will now let you perform a “web” search. It’s rolling out “web” searches now, and in my early tests on desktop, it’s looking like it could be an incredibly popular change to Google’s search engine. The optional setting filters out almost all the other blocks of content that Google crams into a search results page, leaving you with links and text — and Google confirms to The Verge that it will block the company’s new AI Overviews as well. ↫ Sean Hollister at The Verge I hate what the web has become.

## Last Summer Was the Hottest in 2,000 Years

date: 2024-05-15, from: Heatmap News

<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> Wildfires continue to burn out of control in western Canada • An early season heat wave will bring record high temperatures to parts of Florida • <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/newsroom/news/climate-health-risks-posed-by-floods?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">One in eight</a> Europeans now live in an area at risk of flooding. </em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Study: Last summer was the hottest in 2,000 years </h3><p>
	We already know that last summer was the hottest “on record” – but those records only really go back to the 1850s or so. A new <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07512-y?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ#:~:text=Here%2C%20we%20combine%20observed%20and,than%20half%20a%20degree%20Celsius" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> published in the journal <em>Nature</em> looks further into the past and concludes that last summer was the warmest in some 2,000 years in the Northern Hemisphere. To reach this conclusion, researchers examined thousands of tree rings, which <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/how-can-tree-rings-teach-us-about-climate?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">offer clues</a> about a year’s temperature and moisture levels. The tree ring data suggests last summer was about 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the average temperature of the years 1 AD to 1890 AD. The study warns that summer 2024 could be even warmer than 2023.
</p><p>
	A separate <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-made-the-deadly-heatwaves-that-hit-millions-of-highly-vulnerable-people-across-asia-more-frequent-and-extreme?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ" target="_blank">study</a> out yesterday concluded that Southeast Asia’s intense April heat wave was fueled by man-caused climate change. In the Philippines, for example, a 15-day heat wave pushed the heat index to 113 degrees Fahrenheit, disrupting daily life and forcing many schools to close. This extreme weather would have been “impossible” without climate change, the study found.
</p><h3>2. House Democrats launch probe into Trump’s meeting with Big Oil execs</h3><p>
	House Democrats have launched an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/05/14/trump-oil-executives-investigation-democrats/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ" target="_blank">investigation</a> into a recent Mar-a-Lago dinner where former President Donald Trump reportedly asked Big Oil bosses to put $1 billion toward his 2024 presidential campaign and promised to roll back some environmental rules should he win back the White House. The House oversight committee sent letters to oil executives from Cheniere Energy, Chesapeake Energy, Chevron, Continental Resources, EQT Corporation, ExxonMobil, Occidental Petroleum, Venture Global and the American Petroleum Institute. They want the companies to list who attended the meeting, provide copies of any documents distributed, describe any policies that were discussed, and disclose any contributions made to Trump’s campaign during or after the dinner, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/05/14/trump-oil-executives-investigation-democrats/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> <em><em>The Washington Post</em></em>. The top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin, gave the executives a deadline of May 27 to turn over information, but the committee’s investigative powers are limited by the GOP’s control of the House. “If the oil companies decline to turn over the information, Democrats will not be able to subpoena the firms, stymying their investigation,” explained the <em><em>Post</em></em>.
</p><h3>3. Trump chides Biden on new Chinese EV tariffs</h3><p>
	President Biden confirmed yesterday that he is imposing a 100% tariff on Chinese-made electric vehicles, as well as tariff increases on other clean energy technologies including lithium batteries, solar cells, and critical minerals. Former President Trump, speaking from outside the New York courtroom where his hush money trial is taking place, <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/trump-trashes-tariffs-outside-manhattan-trial/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>: “Where have they been for three-and-a-half years? They should have done it a long time ago.”
</p><p>
	There is no equivalence between Biden’ tariffs and the 10% across the board tariff on all imported goods from all countries that Trump has proposed, <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/china-tariffs-biden-evs?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ" rel="noopener" target="_self">wrote Heatmap’s Robinson Meyer</a>. “Biden’s new tariffs focus on certain strategic sectors that American officials believe the country must cultivate to stay at the technological frontier, coupled with pre-existing subsidies meant to spur domestic production of those goods. Some of the tariffs only kick in beginning in 2026 — far enough in the future, policymakers hope, for the market to prepare. Trump’s tariffs, meanwhile, would intentionally and chaotically hike prices.”

	The Department of Energy yesterday <a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-announces-conditional-commitment-plug-power-produce-and-liquify-clean-hydrogen?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">offered</a> Plug Power a conditional commitment of $1.66 billion in loan guarantees to build up to six clean hydrogen plants that use the company’s electrolyzer technology. The hydrogen would “power fuel cell-electric vehicles used in the material handling, transportation, and industrial sectors, resulting in an estimated 84% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional hydrogen production,” the DOE announcement said. Most hydrogen production uses fossil fuels to run an electrolyzer that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. But clean hydrogen relies on electrolyzers powered by renewable sources – or natural gas with carbon capture. The Biden administration sees clean hydrogen as a key part of its push to decarbonize heavy industry. The deal isn’t done yet – Plug will have to prove its projects will benefit local communities and “satisfy certain technical, legal, environmental, and financial conditions” before the loan goes ahead. But the news sent Plug’s stock <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-14/plug-power-surges-after-biden-offers-1-7-billion-in-financing?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">soaring</a> nonetheless.
</p><h3>5. California officials pause solar geoengineering study over safety concerns</h3><p>
	In case you missed it earlier this week (I did!), officials in California have ordered researchers to stop using an aerosol sprayer to test a potential solar geoengineering process for cooling the planet, <em><em>The New York Times</em></em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/13/climate/cloud-brightening-geoengineering.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. The Cloud Aerosol Research Instrument, or CARI, sits on the flight deck of the Hornet, a decommissioned aircraft carrier in Alameda, California. It sprays sea salt aerosol particles into the air, a process that could one day be used to brighten clouds and reflect the sun’s rays. This experiment, which began in early April, marked the first time such a device had been tested outdoors in the U.S. But the city of Alameda told the scientists to stop their research until the health and environmental impacts of the experiment can be evaluated. “The city is evaluating the chemical compounds in the spray to determine if they are a hazard either inhaled in aerosol form by humans and animals, or landing on the ground or in the bay,” city officials said.

## Miniature poodle Sage fetches top prize at Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show

date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — A sprightly miniature poodle named Sage was crowned "Best in Show" on Tuesday at the 148th annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, winning the grand prize in the most prestigious competition among pure-bred canines in the United States.


Sage, the finalist representing 21 breeds classified as non-sporting dogs, triumphed over more than 2,500 top-ranked dogs competing in the two-day contest, held at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in the Queens borough of New York City.




Sage, a 4-year-old black-colored female groomed in the fine, fluffy topiary style traditional for poodles, competed head to head against the winners in six other groups — terriers, hounds, herding dogs, working dogs, sporting dogs and toy dogs.


She was the first female to win the top prize at Westminster since 2020, according to commentators on the Fox Sports channel, which broadcast the event live.


And she became the fourth miniature poodle to claim the top prize in the 148-year history of the contest, with the trophy previously going to her breed in 1943, 1959 and 2002, according to kennel club records.


The larger "standard" poodle breed has been declared Best in Show five times, most recently in 2020, and the smaller "toy" poodle breed has won twice.


The poodle originated as a hunting dog in Germany and is now recognized as the national dog of France.




Sage's handler, Kaz Hosaka, cried tears of joy and carried his prized poodle in his arms around floor of the auditorium to cheers of the crowd as he celebrated what he said was his 45th year participating at the Westminster dog show and the last of his career.


The Westminster dog show bills itself as the second-oldest U.S. sporting event, behind only the Kentucky Derby thoroughbred horse race. This year's competition drew a field of contenders representing 200 breeds from all 50 U.S. states and 12 other countries.




Mercedes, a female 4-year-old German shepherd, was named runner-up for the overall contest, after first winning the top prize in the herding dog group.


Along with Sage and Mercedes, the two other finalists chosen on Monday were Comet the Shih Tzu, representing the toy group, and Louis, the Afghan hound leading the hound group.


Rounding out the finalists were three group winners chosen on Tuesday - Micah the black cocker spaniel, representing sporting dogs; Monty, the giant schnauzer, leading the working dogs; and Frankie, a colored bull terrier from the terrier group.

## It Was a Big Week for the Power Grid

date: 2024-05-15, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjIzMTg2My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMzk0NDQ4OX0.vzSyZRyyC_sUUCciePut_L62gAAq8H76d5gO22r-oeQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Transmission has been one of the biggest obstacles of decarbonizing the power grid in America. In the past week, however, the country has taken two big steps toward finally removing it.
</p><p>
	Last week, the Department of Energy published a list of 10 high-priority areas for grid development, called National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors, designed to help accelerate some of the most annoying aspects of the siting process. Then on Monday, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission passed a new rule directing grid planners to take a longer view on what America’s future electricity needs will look like.
</p><p>
	On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse talk with two special guests — <a href="https://www.energy.gov/gdo/person/maria-robinson" target="_blank">Maria Robinson</a>, who leads the Energy Department’s Grid Deployment Office, and Heatmap reporter <a href="https://heatmap.news/u/matthewzeitlin" target="_blank">Matthew Zeitlin</a> — about what these measures mean for the Biden administration’s climate policy and how soon we might see new power lines get built. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems engineering at Princeton University.

	Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer:</strong> Wow. Okay. So basically, any — so can I just back up for a second? I think, first of all, I just want to go: Wow. So all of, the whole power we’re talking about today is very important. There’s nothing else like it in the federal government. But also, you’re going to have to do a whole NEPA process on it?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Maria Robinson:</strong> Yes, so we’re going to have to do a whole NEPA process for each one of these areas that we’re designating for NIETCs. And then the other part of this is that if they access some funding, they’re going to have to do another NEPA process. And if they access backstop siting at a FERC, you may have to do another NEPA process. And I know Congress is investigating a couple of remedies to that.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins:</strong> So that’s pretty important. Because the goal here is to try to accelerate the development of transmission, which is critical to tap into the best wind and solar resources across the country that can help lower electricity costs and help decarbonize the grid to meet the growing need for electricity. That’s coming from data centers, as listeners have heard here on Shift Key, from electrification of vehicles, hydrogen production, etc. So we’ve got a big pressure to increase the electricity supply in the country. And, you know, the cheapest resources are renewables, but we’ve got to be able to plug them into the grid.<br/>
<br/>
	So if this process is going to ... designating these NIETCs and then ultimately getting transmission lines built out within them, with access to federal support for financing and backstop siting authority, is going to play out over a multi-year NEPA process — or several of them — how quickly could we realistically expect to start seeing transmission lines built within some of these corridors?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Maria Robinson:</strong> What’s great about the cohort — and this is just our very first cohort of those named national transmission corridors. We anticipate that we’ll open up applications again, maybe as soon as this fall, for another round, as well, depending on how many we move forward with to do full NEPA on. It really depends on our ability to get all of that NEPA done. <br/>
<br/>
	But some of these are really ready for prime time. Some of them are just looking for some additional financing. And are looking at construction dates as soon as, say, 2028, 2029, which in the grand scheme of things for transmission is relatively soon.

## Office Hours: A convicted criminal for president?

date: 2024-05-15, from: Robert Reich on Substack

Friends, In a few weeks, Donald Trump may be a convicted criminal. It&#8217;s hardly a sure thing, of course. All he needs for a mistrial is one holdout juror. But the evidence so far seems overwhelming and damning. So we have to face a daunting reality. For the first time in history, a convicted criminal may be the nominee of one of our major parties and on November&#8217;s presidential ballot.

## Administration sending $1 billion more in weapons to Israel, sources say

date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration has told key lawmakers it is sending a new package of more than $1 billion in arms and ammunition to Israel, three congressional aides said Tuesday.


It's the first arms shipment to Israel to be announced by the administration since it put another arms transfer — consisting of 3,500 bombs — on hold this month. The administration has said it paused that earlier transfer to keep Israel from using the bombs in its growing offensive in the crowded southern Gaza city of Rafah.


The White House has come under criticism from both sides of the political spectrum in the U.S. over its military support for Israel's now seven-month war against Hamas in Gaza. Some of President Joe Biden's fellow Democrats have pushed him to limit transfers of offensive weapons to Israel to pressure the U.S. ally to do more to protect Palestinian civilians. Many Republicans condemn any lessening of military backing to Israel.


The package being sent includes about $700 million for tank ammunition, $500 million in tactical vehicles and $60 million in mortar rounds, the congressional aides said. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an arms transfer that has not yet been made public.


There was no immediate indication when the arms would be sent. It's not clear if this shipment is part of the long-delayed foreign aid package that Congress passed and Biden signed last month, a tranche from existing arms sale or a new sale.


The Wall Street Journal first reported the plans to move the package.


House Republicans were planning this week to advance a bill to mandate the delivery of offensive weaponry for Israel. Following Biden's move to put a pause on bomb shipments last week, Republicans have been swift in their condemnation, arguing it represents the abandonment of the closest U.S. ally in the Middle East.


The White House said Tuesday that Biden would veto the bill if it were to pass Congress. The bill also has practically no chance in the Democratic-controlled Senate. But House Democrats are somewhat divided on the issue, and roughly two dozen have signed onto a letter to the Biden administration saying they were "deeply concerned about the message" sent by pausing the bomb shipment.


In addition to the written veto threat, the White House has been in touch with various lawmakers and congressional aides about the legislation, according to an administration official.


"We strongly, strongly oppose attempts to constrain the President's ability to deploy U.S. security assistance consistent with U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives," White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said this week, adding that the administration plans to spend "every last cent" appropriated by Congress in the national security supplemental package that was signed into law by Biden last month.

## Republicans advance Senate candidates in West Virginia, Maryland

date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA

ANNAPOLIS, Md.  — Republican voters advanced strong Senate contenders in Maryland and West Virginia on Tuesday, giving the party a big boost in its push to claim control of Congress' upper chamber.


Former Governor Larry Hogan claimed the Republican nomination in what will be a marquee race in Maryland against Angela Alsobrooks, a top local official who could become the fourth Black woman in U.S. history to serve in the Senate.


Meanwhile, another popular Republican, Governor Jim Justice, won the Senate nomination in deep-red West Virginia, becoming the overwhelming favorite in the race that represents the Republicans' best pickup opportunity in the nation.


In both states, which share a border but feature antithetical politics, the Republican nominees represent a serious challenge for Democrats in the general election as they cling to a 51-49 Senate majority and defend seats in other states that former President Donald Trump won four years ago.


At the same time, Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden sought to project strength in low-stakes presidential primaries. And further down the ballot, two people who were on opposite sides of the Jan. 6 insurrection lost their U.S. House bids — a former Capitol Police officer running in Maryland and a former West Virginia state lawmaker who participated in the riot.


In all, three states hosted statewide primary elections Tuesday — Maryland, Nebraska and West Virginia — as Republicans and Democrats picked their nominees for a slate of November elections that will decide the presidency and control of Congress.


Maryland


In Maryland, Hogan gives Republicans a legitimate chance at picking up a Senate seat in the deep-blue state for the first time in more than four decades.


Hogan overcame his years-long criticism of Trump, a position that put him at odds with many Republican primary voters but will undoubtedly help him in the general election this fall. Maryland voters gave Biden a 33-point victory over Trump four years ago.


On the other side in the Senate contest, Democratic voters nominated Alsobrooks, the top official in Prince George's County outside of Washington. The 53-year-old African American county executive had been endorsed by many of the state’s top officials, including Governor Wes Moore, Senator Chris Van Hollen and U.S. Representative Steny Hoyer.


Alsobrooks prevailed after a contentious and expensive primary against U.S. Representative David Trone, a liquor store magnate who had invested more than $61 million into his unsuccessful bid.


Race was an issue in the Democratic primary and may be in the general election in the months ahead. Alsobrooks is trying to become the first Black senator from a state in which roughly one in three residents identifies as African American.


On the social media site X, Hogan congratulated Alsobrooks and said, “Voters have a clear and stark choice: more of the dysfunctional partisan status quo or real independent and bipartisan leadership.”


Alsobrooks, also posting on X, promised to “defeat Larry Hogan, keep Maryland blue, and keep our Senate under Democratic control.”


West Virginia


Justice won his primary against U.S. Representative Alex Mooney in the race to replace Senator Joe Manchin. With Manchin gone, the seat is almost guaranteed to turn red come November.


Justice, a former billionaire with a folksy personality, is wildly popular in the state. He also earned Trump's endorsement. A former Democrat, Justice switched to the Republican Party in 2017, announcing the change at a Trump rally.


Mooney had tried to win over conservatives by labeling Justice as someone who would support Democratic policies. Justice did support Biden's bipartisan infrastructure law, saying West Virginia couldn't afford to turn away the money offered in the bill.


West Virginia is also deciding its candidates for governor. Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, the Republican nominee in the 2018 Senate race against Manchin, is running for the Republican nomination. He's up against former state Representative Moore Capito, whose mother is Senator Shelley Moore Capito.


Presidential primary


Biden and Trump have already amassed enough delegates to claim the presidential nominations at their respective national conventions this summer. Yet voters on both sides hope to register a significant protest vote Tuesday that will demonstrate their dissatisfaction with the Biden-Trump rematch.


Both Biden and Trump won their primaries in West Virginia and Maryland.


Still, Maryland progressives especially unhappy with the Biden administration's support for Israel in its war against Hamas had encouraged voters to select "uncommitted to any presidential candidate" instead of Biden. There was no uncommitted option in West Virginia or Nebraska.


Everett Bellamy, a Democrat who voted early in Annapolis, said he voted "uncommitted" instead of Biden as a protest against the killing of women and children and noncombatants in Gaza.


Meanwhile, Trump's Republican critics cannot choose "uncommitted," but they can choose his former Republican rival Nikki Haley, who will appear on the ballot in Maryland, Nebraska and West Virginia despite formally suspending her campaign more than two months ago.


Derek Faux, an independent voter from Charleston, West Virginia, said he supported Haley, and in other Republican races, he said he voted for the candidates he believed were least like Trump.


Capitol attack


Tuesday's elections also included two candidates who were intimately involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.


In Maryland, former Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn was among nearly two dozen Democrats running in the state’s 3rd Congressional District. The 40-year-old Democrat lost to State Senator Sarah Elfreth.


In West Virginia, a former member of the House of Delegates, Derrick Evans, lost his bid to oust incumbent Republican Representative Carol Miller in the 1st Congressional District.


The 39-year-old Evans served a three-month jail sentence after livestreaming himself participating in the storming of the U.S. Capitol.


Other key races


In Nebraska, Republican Senators Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts both face nominal opposition in their primaries, one of the rare occasions when both senators in a state are on the ballot at the same time. And in Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District, Republican U.S. Representative Don Bacon faces a challenge from his right flank.


In North Carolina, voters finalized their pick of the Trump-endorsed Brad Knott in what had become a one-person Republican primary in the state's 13th Congressional District.

## Justice Department says Boeing could be prosecuted in 737 Max crashes

date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Boeing has violated a settlement that allowed the company to avoid criminal prosecution after two deadly crashes involving its 737 Max aircraft more than five years ago, the Justice Department told a federal judge on Tuesday.


It is now up to the Justice Department to decide whether to file charges against Boeing. Prosecutors will tell the court no later than July 7 how they plan to proceed, the department said.


New 737 Max jets crashed in 2018 in Indonesia and 2019 in Ethiopia, killing 346 people. Boeing reached a $2.5 billion settlement with the Justice Department in January 2021 to avoid prosecution on a single charge of fraud — misleading federal regulators who approved the plane. Boeing blamed the deception on two relatively low-level employees.


In a letter filed Tuesday in federal court in Texas, Glenn Leon, head of the Justice Department criminal division's fraud section, said Boeing violated terms of the settlement by failing to make promised changes to detect and prevent violations of federal anti-fraud laws.


The determination means that Boeing could be prosecuted "for any federal criminal violation of which the United States has knowledge," including the charge of fraud that the company hoped to avoid with the settlement, the Justice Department said.


However, it is not clear whether the government will prosecute Boeing.


"The Government is determining how it will proceed in this matter," the Justice Department said in the court filing. Boeing will have until June 13 to respond to the government's allegation, and department said it will consider the company's explanation "in determining whether to pursue prosecution."


Boeing Co., which is based in Arlington, Virginia, disputed the Justice Department's finding.


"We believe that we have honored the terms of that agreement, and look forward to the opportunity to respond to the Department on this issue," a Boeing spokesperson said in a statement. "As we do so, we will engage with the Department with the utmost transparency, as we have throughout the entire term of the agreement, including in response to their questions following the Alaska Airlines 1282 accident."


Boeing has come under renewed scrutiny since that Alaska Airlines flight in January, when a door plug blew out of a 737 Max, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the jetliner. The company is under multiple investigations into the blowout and its manufacturing quality. The FBI has told passengers from the flight that they might be victims of a crime.


Prosecutors said they will meet on May 31 with families of passengers who died in the two Max crashes. Family members were angry and disappointed after a similar meeting last month.


Paul Cassell, a lawyer who represents families of passengers in the second crash, said the Justice Department's determination that Boeing breached the settlement terms is "a positive first step, and for the families, a long time coming."


"But we need to see further action from DOJ to hold Boeing accountable, and plan to use our meeting on May 31 to explain in more details what we believe would be a satisfactory remedy to Boeing's ongoing criminal conduct," Cassell said.


Investigations into the crashes pointed to a flight-control system that Boeing added to the Max without telling pilots or airlines. Boeing downplayed the significance of the system, then didn't overhaul it until after the second crash.


After secret negotiations, the government agreed not to prosecute Boeing on a charge of defrauding the United States by deceiving regulators about the flight system. The settlement included a $243.6 million fine, a $500 million fund for victim compensation, and nearly $1.8 billion to airlines whose Max jets were grounded for nearly two years.
