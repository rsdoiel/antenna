<h2 id="us-europe-warn-lebanons-hezbollah-to-ease-strikes-on-israel">US,
Europe warn Lebanon’s Hezbollah to ease strikes on Israel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S., European and Arab mediators are pressing to keep
stepped-up cross-border attacks between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah
militants from spiraling into a wider Middle East war that the world has
feared for months.</p>
<p>Hopes are lagging for a cease-fire anytime soon in Israel’s conflict
with Hamas in Gaza that would calm attacks by Hezbollah and other
Iranian-allied militias. With that in mind, American and European
officials are delivering warnings to Hezbollah, which is far stronger
than Hamas but seen as overconfident, about taking on the military might
of Israel, current and former diplomats say.</p>
<p>They are warning that the group should not count on the United States
or anyone else being able to hold off Israeli leaders if they decide to
execute battle-ready plans for an offensive into Lebanon. And Hezbollah
should not count on its fighters’ ability to handle whatever would come
next.</p>
<p>On both sides of the Lebanese border, escalating strikes between
Israel and Hezbollah, one of the region’s best-armed fighting forces,
appeared at least to level off this past week. While daily strikes still
pound the border area, the slight shift offered hope of easing immediate
fears, which had prompted the U.S. to send an amphibious assault ship
with a Marine expeditionary force to join other warships in the area in
hopes of deterring a wider conflict.</p>
<p>It’s not clear whether Israel or Hezbollah has decided to ratchet
down attacks to avoid triggering an Israeli invasion into Lebanon, said
Gerald Feierstein, a former senior U.S. diplomat in the Middle East.
Despite this past week’s plateauing of hostilities, “it certainly seems
the Israelis are still … arranging themselves in the expectation that
there will be some kind of conflict … an entirely different magnitude of
conflict,” he said. </p>
<p>The message being delivered to Hezbollah is “don’t think that you’re
as capable as you think you are,” he said.</p>
<p>Beginning the day after Hamas’ October 7 terror attacks on Israel
triggered the war in Gaza, Hezbollah has launched rockets into northern
Israel and vowed to continue until a cease-fire takes hold. Israel has
hit back, with the violence forcing tens of thousands of civilians from
the border in both countries. Attacks intensified this month after
Israel killed a top Hezbollah commander and Hezbollah responded with
some of its biggest missile barrages.</p>
<p>U.N. humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths used the word “apocalyptic”
to describe a war that could result. Israel and Hezbollah, the dominant
force in politically fractured Lebanon, have the power to cause heavy
casualties.</p>
<p>“Such a war would be a catastrophe for Lebanon,” U.S. Secretary of
Defense Lloyd Austin said as he met recently with Israeli Defense
Minister Yoav Gallant at the Pentagon. “Another war between Israel and
Hezbollah could easily become a regional war, with terrible consequences
for the Middle East.”</p>
<p>Gallant, in response, said, “We are working closely together to
achieve an agreement, but we must also discuss readiness on every
possible scenario.”</p>
<p>Analysts expect other Iran-allied militias in the region would
respond far more forcefully than they have for Hamas, and some experts
warn of ideologically motivated militants streaming into the region to
join in. Europeans fear destabilizing refugee flows.</p>
<p>While Iran, which is preoccupied with a political transition at home,
shows no sign of wanting a war now, it sees Hezbollah as its
strategically vital partner in the region — much more so than Hamas —
and could be drawn in.</p>
<p>“Obviously if it does look like things are going seriously south for
the Israelis, the U.S. will intervene,” Feierstein said. “I don’t think
that they would see any alternative to that.”</p>
<p>While the United States helped Israel knock down a barrage of Iranian
missiles and drones in April, it likely would not do as well assisting
Israel’s defense against any broader Hezbollah attacks, said General
Charles Q. Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It is harder to
fend off the shorter-range rockets that Hezbollah fires routinely across
the border, he said.</p>
<p>The Israeli army is stretched after a nearly nine-month war in Gaza,
and Hezbollah holds an estimated arsenal of some 150,000 rockets and
missiles capable of striking anywhere in Israel. Israeli leaders,
meanwhile, have pledged to unleash Gaza-like scenes of devastation on
Lebanon if a full-blown war erupts.</p>
<p>White House senior adviser Amos Hochstein, President Joe Biden’s
point person on Israel-Hezbollah tensions, has not been successful so
far in getting the two sides to dial back the attacks.</p>
<p>The French, who have ties as Lebanon’s former colonial power, and
other Europeans also are mediating, along with the Qataris and
Egyptians.</p>
<p>White House officials have blamed Hezbollah for escalating tensions
and said it backs Israel’s right to defend itself. The Biden
administration also has told the Israelis that opening a second front is
not in their interest. That was a point hammered home to Gallant during
his latest talks in Washington with Secretary of State Antony Blinken,
Austin, CIA Director William Burns, national security adviser Jake
Sullivan, Hochstein and others.</p>
<p>“We’re going to continue to help Israel defend itself; that’s not
going to change,” White House national security spokesperson John Kirby
said. “But as for a hypothetical — specifically with respect to the
northern border line … again, we want to see no second front opened, and
we want to see if we can’t resolve the tensions out there through
diplomatic processes.”</p>
<p>White House officials, however, are not discounting the real
possibility that a second front in the Mideast conflict could open.</p>
<p>In conversations with Israeli and Lebanese officials and other
regional stakeholders, there is agreement that “a major escalation is
not in anybody’s interest,” a senior Biden administration official
said.</p>
<p>The official, who was not authorized to comment publicly about White
House deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity, bristled at the
“purported logic” of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah arguing that
Israel would see an end to Hezbollah attacks by reaching a cease-fire
agreement with Hamas in Gaza.</p>
<p>But the official also acknowledged that an elusive cease-fire deal in
Gaza would go a long way in quieting tensions on the Israel-Lebanon
border.</p>

moving tons of aid from US-built pier after work suspended</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>JERUSALEM — Humanitarian workers have started moving tons of aid that
piled up at a United States-built pier off the Gaza coast to warehouses
in the besieged territory, the United Nations said Saturday, an
important step as the U.S. considers whether to resume pier operations
after yet another pause due to heavy seas.</p>
<p>It was not clear when the aid might reach Palestinians in the Gaza
Strip, where experts have warned of the high risk of famine as the war
between Israel and Hamas militants is in its ninth month. This is the
first time trucks have moved aid from the pier since the U.N.’s World
Food Program suspended operations there due to security concerns on June
9.</p>
<p>Millions of pounds of aid have piled up. In just the last week, more
than 4.5 million kilograms (10 million pounds) were moved ashore,
according to the U.S. military.</p>
<p>A WFP spokesperson, Abeer Etefa, told The Associated Press this is a
one-time operation until the beach is cleared of the aid and is being
done to avoid spoilage.</p>
<p>Further U.N. operations at the pier depend on U.N. security
assessments, Etefa said.</p>
<p>The U.N. is investigating whether the pier was used in an Israeli
military operation last month to rescue three hostages.</p>
<p>If WFP trucks successfully bring the aid to warehouses inside Gaza,
that could affect the U.S. military’s decision whether to reinstall the
pier, which was removed due to weather Friday. U.S. officials said they
were considering not reinstalling the pier because of the possibility
that the aid would not be picked up.</p>
<p>Even if the U.N. decides to keep transporting aid from the pier into
Gaza, lawlessness around humanitarian convoys will be a further
challenge to distribution. The convoys have come under attack in Gaza.
While most aid deliveries come by land, restrictions around border
crossings and on what items can enter Gaza have further hurt a
population that was already dependent on humanitarian aid before the
war.</p>
<p>The June 9 pause at the pier came after the Israeli military used a
nearby area to fly out hostages after their rescue in a raid that killed
more than 270 Palestinians, prompting a U.N. review over concerns that
aid workers’ safety and neutrality may have been compromised.</p>
<p>Battles continue</p>
<p>More than 37,800 Palestinians have been killed in the war since it
began with Hamas’ attack on southern Israel on October 7, according to
Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and
combatants in its toll. The ministry said the bodies of 40 people killed
by Israeli strikes had been brought to local hospitals over the past 24
hours.</p>
<p>At least two people were killed and six injured, including a child,
in a strike in Bureij camp in central Gaza.</p>
<p>The October 7 Hamas attack killed some 1,200 people, mostly
civilians, and another 250 people were taken hostage.</p>
<p>Israeli forces have been battling Palestinian militants in an eastern
part of Gaza City over the last week. Tens of thousands of Palestinians
have fled their homes, according to the U.N.</p>
<p>“It’s like the first weeks of the invasion,” one resident, Mahmoud
al-Masry, said of the intensity of the fighting. “Many people were
killed. Many houses were destroyed. They strike anything moving.”</p>
<p>The Israeli military acknowledged an operation against Hamas fighters
in Shijaiyah and Saturday noted “close-quarters combat.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere, thousands of Palestinians who remained in Gaza’s
southernmost city of Rafah fled Friday for Muwasi, a crowded coastal
tent camp designated by the Israeli army as a safe zone. Some told the
AP they evacuated because Israeli gunfire and missiles had come close to
where they were sheltering.</p>
<p>Over 1.3 million Palestinians have fled Rafah since Israel’s
incursion into the city in early May, while aid groups warn there are no
safe places to go.</p>
<p>With the heat in Gaza reaching over 32 degrees Celsius (89
Fahrenheit), many displaced people have found tents unbearable. The
territory has been without electricity since Israel cut off power as
part of the war, and Israel also stopped pumping drinking water to the
enclave.</p>
<p>“Death is better than it, it is a grave,” said Barawi Bakroun, who
was displaced from Gaza City, as others fanned themselves with pieces of
cardboard.</p>

appeals to donors concerned about debate performance</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — U.S. President Joe Biden is looking to recapture his mojo
and reassure donors at a Saturday fundraiser that he is fully up to the
challenge of beating Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The 81-year-old’s troubling performance at the first presidential
debate Thursday rattled many Democrats, who see Trump after the January
6, 2021, insurrection as an existential threat to U.S. democracy.
Biden’s meandering answers and struggles to respond to Trump prompted
The New York Times editorial board to declare Friday that he should exit
the race and that staying in would be a “reckless gamble.”</p>
<p>Biden and his wife, Jill, planned to attend an afternoon campaign
meeting in East Hampton, New York, the Long Island beach town where the
real estate firm Zillow prices the median home at $1.9 million.
Scheduled later was an evening fundraiser in Red Bank, New Jersey.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of Thursday night’s debate, Biden flashed more vigor
in speeches in North Carolina and New York on Friday, saying he believes
with “all my heart and soul” that he can do the job of the
presidency.</p>
<p>The Biden campaign said it has raised more than $27 million on
Thursday and Friday, including $3 million at a New York City fundraiser
focused on the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
<p>Jill Biden told supporters Friday that he said to her after the
debate, “You know, Jill, I don’t know what happened. I didn’t feel that
great.” The first lady then said she responded to him, “Look, Joe, we
are not going to let 90 minutes define the four years that you’ve been
president.”</p>
<p>The Democratic president still needs to allay the fears stirred by
the debate as it seeped into the public conscience with clips and memes
spreading on the internet and public pressure for him to bow out of the
race.</p>
<p>Democratic donors across New York, Southern California and Silicon
Valley privately expressed deep concerns about the viability of Biden’s
campaign in the wake of his debate performance.</p>
<p>In a series of text message chains and private conversations, they
discussed the short list of possible replacements, a group that included
Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, California Governor Gavin Newsom and
Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>But on Friday, there was no formal push to pressure Biden to step
aside, and some suspected there never would be given the logistical
challenges associated with replacing the presumptive nominee just four
months before Election Day.</p>
<p>Some donors noted they were going to pause their personal giving.
They said receipts from Biden’s weekend fundraiser would almost
certainly be strong because the tickets were sold and paid for before
the debate.</p>

advocates worry Jan. 6 Capitol riot is being forgotten</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — In the first presidential debate, Republican Donald
Trump skimmed over the January 6, 2021, attack at the Capitol, shifted
blame for the violent mob siege and declined repeatedly to state
unequivocally that he will accept the results of this year’s White House
election.</p>
<p>And President Joe Biden, who has said the work of his presidency is
to restore the soul of the nation, flubbed and floundered, failing to
forcefully confront, contradict and hold Trump, the indicted former
president, accountable for the attack on the election — and
democracy.</p>
<p>It is an extraordinary moment, or lack of one, that is alarming to
democracy advocates, the far-reaching effort to overturn the 2020
election and the subsequent insurrection that defined the Trump
presidency fading from view during the opening debate of the general
election campaign.</p>
<p>Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, the Democrat who chaired the
House’s January 6 committee investigation in the last Congress, said it
is a deeply unfortunate situation.</p>
<p>“We could have a January 6, 2.0,” Thompson said Friday outside the
Capitol.</p>
<p>The outcome underscores the choice Americans face this fall as the
riot over the 2020 election remains fundamental to the 2024 campaign,
but also obscured by it, despite the four-count federal indictment
against Trump for working to overturn the results four years ago in the
run-up to the violent siege and despite the convictions of more than
1,000 people in the Capitol attack.</p>
<p>It comes as the Supreme Court is weighing cases involving January 6,
including a decision Friday that makes it easier for some rioters to
contest their charges and convictions, and another expected Monday on
whether Trump can claim immunity in the federal election case.</p>
<p>All told, what seemed politically untenable, as the defeated Trump
departed Washington downcast on Biden’s inauguration day on January 20,
2021, is now within reach as the president who tried to overturn an
election is the Republican Party’s presumptive nominee, edging toward an
Oval Office return.</p>
<p>“We are four months away from the first presidential election since a
violent attack on our Capitol. … And the man responsible for that —
Donald Trump — is currently the leading candidate,” said Ian Bassin,
executive director of the advocacy group Protect Democracy, which works
to counter authoritarianism.</p>
<p>“You’d think that alone would be disqualifying, or at a minimum would
be the central focus of the election,” he said.</p>
<p>And yet, Bassin said, the topic was “relegated to an afterthought” in
the debate, “and the current president is struggling to press the case
on why this issue should be of existential importance.”</p>
<p>The forum itself is not necessarily to blame. The moderators pressed
the candidates, asking Trump not once, but repeatedly, whether he would
commit to not having another January 6 and accepting the results of the
election this time.</p>
<p>Trump insisted he had “virtually nothing to do” with the storming of
the Capitol on January 6 and tried to shift blame to then-House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, repeating his false claims about the delay in
sending in the National Guard.</p>
<p>Biden, whose underwhelming debate performance of stunted answers and
trailing thoughts has sent the Democratic Party into turmoil, struggled
to deliver a cohesive response, despite having given high-profile
speeches about January 6, including on the first anniversary.</p>
<p>“Look, he encouraged those folks to go up on Capitol Hill,” Biden
said on the debate stage.</p>
<p>Thompson, whose committee produced a lengthy, 1,000-plus page report
on its investigation into Trump’s monthslong attempt to overturn the
election and the storming of the Capitol, said Biden missed a “golden
opportunity” to set the record straight as millions of people watched
the debate.</p>
<p>It was left to the people who actually experienced January 6, the
lawmakers who fled to safety as the mob of Trump supporters approached,
to respond. Rioters, many wielding flag poles and with tactical gear,
engaged in brutal, bloody hand-to-hand combat, fighting the U.S. Capitol
Police to gain access to the building.</p>
<p>“January 6 was a dark day,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck
Schumer, a Democrat, on social media.</p>
<p>“Trump-inspired insurrectionists sought to obstruct the peaceful
transfer of power,” he said. Schumer decried Friday’s “shameful
decision” from the Supreme Court that he said “will embolden
anti-democracy radicals and make it harder for our judicial system to
try insurrectionists.”</p>
<p>Pelosi said Trump presented “another pack of lies” during the debate.
“How dare he place the blame for January 6th on anyone but himself, the
inciter of an insurrection?”</p>
<p>On Friday, the Supreme Court limited a federal obstruction law that
has been used to charge Trump, alongside hundreds of Capitol riot
defendants. While the ruling is certain to cause a reconsideration of
some cases against the rioters, it is unclear how it will impact Trump’s
indictment, which includes other charges.</p>
<p>Trump, during a rally Friday in Chesapeake, Virginia, said a “great
thing” just happened in response to the decision in the obstruction
case, to the roar of “USA!” chants from the crowd.</p>
<p>“They should be immediately released — immediately,” Trump said about
the defendants he called “the J6 hostages.”</p>
<p>A more energized Biden, at his own rally in the swing state of North
Carolina, said, “The choice in this election is simple. Donald Trump
will destroy our democracy. I will defend it.”</p>

tankers, helicopters attack Arizona wildfire near Phoenix</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SCOTTSDALE, Arizona — Air tankers and helicopters helped douse flames
from the sky as nearly 200 firefighters on the ground battled a wildfire
northeast of Phoenix on Friday that threatened scores of homes and
forced dozens of residents to evacuate.</p>
<p>Authorities expanded the evacuation area in a subdivision on the
northeast outskirts of Scottsdale, closed roads and shut down part of a
nature preserve as gusty winds continued to fan the flames in extremely
hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>But there were no immediate reports of injuries or structure damage,
Arizona fire officials said.</p>
<p>Near Phoenix, where the high reached 43.3 degrees Celsius (110
Fahrenheit) Friday, about 60 residents evacuated homes in the Boulder
Heights subdivision overnight after the human-caused fire broke out
about 2:30 p.m. Thursday.</p>
<p>Fire officials said they were investigating exactly what sparked the
blaze about 8 kilometers (5 miles) east of Carefree, just outside
northern Scottsdale on the edge of the Tonto National Forest.</p>
<p>Dubbed the Boulder View Fire, it has burned about 13 square
kilometers (5 square miles) with zero containment, authorities said.</p>
<p>“The southeast side of the fire remained active throughout the night
producing 20-to-40-foot flame lengths in areas,” Tiffany Davila, a
spokesperson for the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management,
said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Additional resources were redirected to that side of the fire last
night to begin structure protection and help crews start firing
operations to tie the fire into nearby roads,” she said.</p>
<p>The Red Cross set up an evacuation center at a high school in
Scottsdale, and shelters for horses and other large animals were
established at several locations, including the rodeo grounds at nearby
Cave Creek.</p>
<p>Scottsdale officials closed part of the McDowell Sonoran Preserve as
a precaution but said there was no immediate threat.</p>
<p>The air tankers armed with red retardant and helicopters hauling
giant buckets of water helped ground crews keep the flames away from
power lines in the area so far, fire officials said.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service said above-normal temperatures will
persist well into next week, with many lower desert locations seeing
highs near or exceeding 43.3 degrees C (110 F) each afternoon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in central Oregon, fire officials were releasing some crews
from the lines south of Bend because conditions have improved, and the
threat posed by a wildfire to the community around La Pine has decreased
after hundreds were evacuated earlier this week.</p>
<p>Firefighters said Friday they had dug fire lines around nearly half
of the Darlene 3 fire, near La Pine, which has now burned an estimated
15.5 square kilometers (6 square miles) and was listed at 42%
containment.</p>
<p>And in Central California, about 200 firefighters were making
progress on a large blaze that has burned an estimated 23.3 square
kilometers (9 square miles) about 97 kilometers (60 miles) east of
Fresno. It was the only one still burning of 18 fires that were sparked
by lightning along the western edge of the Sierra Nevada when a storm
moved through this week, officials said.</p>

id="amid-north-korea-china-threats-us-pursues-partnerships-with-asian-allies">Amid
North Korea, China threats, US pursues partnerships with Asian
allies</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>GIMHAE AIR BASE, South Korea — The United States wrapped up its first
multidomain exercise with Japan and South Korea in the East China Sea on
Saturday, a step forward in Washington’s efforts to strengthen and lock
in its security partnerships with key Asian allies in the face of
growing threats from North Korea and China.</p>
<p>The three-day Freedom Edge increased the sophistication of previous
exercises with simultaneous air and naval drills geared toward improving
joint ballistic-missile defense, anti-submarine warfare, surveillance
and other skills and capabilities.</p>
<p>The exercise, which is expected to expand in years to come, was also
intended to improve the countries’ abilities to share missile warnings —
increasingly important as North Korea tests ever-more sophisticated
systems.</p>
<p>Other than Australia, Japan and South Korea are the only U.S.
partners in the region with militaries sophisticated enough to integrate
operations with the U.S. so that if, for example, South Korea were to
detect a target, it could quickly relay details so Japanese or American
counterparts could respond, said Ridzwan Rahmat, a Singapore-based
analyst with the defense intelligence company Janes.</p>
<p>“That’s the kind of interoperability that is involved in a typical
war scenario,” Rahmat said. “For trilateral exercises like this, the
intention is to develop the interoperability between the three armed
forces so that they can fight better as a cohesive fighting force.”</p>
<p>Such exercises also carry the risk of increasing tensions, with China
regularly denouncing drills in what it considers its sphere of
influence, and North Korea already slamming the arrival of the USS
Theodore Roosevelt carrier group in the port of Busan — home to South
Korea’s navy headquarters and its Gimhae Air Base — in preparation for
Freedom Edge as “provocative” and “dangerous.”</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the day after South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol
visited the Roosevelt in Busan, becoming the first sitting South Korean
president to board a U.S. aircraft carrier since 1994, North Korea
tested what it said was a multiwarhead missile, the first known launch
of the developmental weapon, if confirmed.</p>
<p>South Korea’s military said a joint analysis by South Korean and U.S.
authorities assessed that the North Korean missile launch failed.</p>
<p>The defense cooperation involving Japan and South Korea is also
politically complex for Yoon and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida,
due to the lingering resentment over Imperial Japan’s brutal occupation
of Korea before and during World War II.</p>
<p>The two countries have the largest militaries among American allies
in East Asia — and together host some 80,000 American troops on their
territories — but the U.S. has tended to work with them individually
rather than together due to their history.</p>
<p>Kishida’s increase of defense spending and cooperation with South
Korea have generally been well received by the Japanese public but has
caused friction with the right wing of his own party, while Yoon’s
domestic appeal has weakened, but he has stayed the course.</p>
<p>“South Korea’s shift under the Yoon administration toward improving
its relations with Japan has been extremely significant,” said Heigo
Sato, international politics professor and security expert at Takushoku
University in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Both leaders are seen to be trying to fortify their defense
relationships with Washington ahead of the inauguration of a new
president, with South Korean officials saying recently that they hope to
sign a formal security framework agreement with the U.S. and Japan this
year that would lock in a joint approach to responding to a possible
attack from North Korea.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration has also long been working
to increase cooperation between South Korea and Japan — something that
many didn’t think was possible at the start of his presidency, said Euan
Graham, a defense analyst with the Australian Strategic Policy
Institute.</p>
<p>“Credit where it’s due — the fact that it’s happening is a
significant achievement from the administration’s regional policy,” he
said.</p>
<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump caused friction with both allies
during his time in office by demanding greater payment for their hosting
of U.S. troops while holding one-on-one meetings with North Korea’s Kim
Jong Un.</p>
<p>Under Biden, Washington is seeking to solidify its system of
alliances, both with increasingly sophisticated exercises and diplomatic
agreements, Graham said.</p>
<p>Tensions with North Korea are at their highest point in years, with
the pace of Kim Jong Un’s weapons programs intensifying, despite heavy
international sanctions.</p>
<p>China, meanwhile, has been undertaking a massive military buildup of
nuclear and conventional weapons, and now has the world’s largest navy.
It claims both the self-governing island of Taiwan and virtually the
entirety of the South China Sea as its own territory and has
increasingly turned to its military to press those claims.</p>
<p>China and North Korea have also been among Russia’s closest allies in
its war against Ukraine, while Russia and China are also key allies for
North Korea, as well as the military leaders of Myanmar who seized power
in 2021 and are facing ever-stiffer resistance in that country’s civil
war.</p>
<p>In Pyongyang this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kim
concluded a mutual defense pact, agreeing to come to the other’s aid in
the event of an attack, rattling others in the region.</p>
<p>Despite a greater number of ships overall, China still only has three
aircraft carriers compared to the U.S. fleet’s 11 — probably the most
effective tool a country has to bring vast amounts of power to bear at a
great distance from home.</p>
<p>China’s advantage, however, is that its primary concern is the nearby
waters of the Indo-Pacific, while Washington’s global focus means that
its naval assets are spread widely. Following the exercises in the East
China Sea with Japan and South Korea, the Roosevelt is due to sail to
the Middle East to help protect ships against attacks by Yemen’s Houthi
rebels.</p>
<p>That has made strong security partnerships even more important, not
only with Japan and South Korea but with Australia, the Philippines,
Taiwan and others in the region, and building those up has been a
priority for the Biden administration.</p>

<h2 id="us-military-says-it-destroyed-7-drones-vehicle-in-yemen">US
military says it destroyed 7 drones, vehicle in Yemen</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — American forces destroyed seven drones and a control
station vehicle in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen over the past 24
hours, the U.S. military said Friday.</p>
<p>The strikes were carried out because the drones and the vehicle
“presented an imminent threat to U.S. coalition forces, and merchant
vessels in the region,” the U.S. Central Command said in a statement on
social media platform X.</p>
<p>The Iran-backed Houthis have been targeting vessels in the Red Sea
and Gulf of Aden since November 2023 in attacks they say are in
solidarity with Palestinians during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza
Strip.</p>
<p>On Friday, Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree claimed
responsibility for attacks on four vessels, including a “direct hit” on
the Delonix tanker in the Red Sea after an operation involving a number
of ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>However, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said
five missiles were fired on Friday in “close proximity” to this vessel,
which it said reported no damage. </p>
<p>The Delonix was located around 277 kilometers northwest of the
Houthi-controlled port of Hodeida when it was attacked, according to
UKMTO, which is run by Britain’s Royal Navy.</p>
<p>The Houthis also claimed attacks on the Waler oil tanker and Johannes
Maersk container ship in the Mediterranean Sea and the Ioannis bulk
carrier in the Red Sea.</p>
<p>The United States in December announced a maritime security
initiative to protect Red Sea shipping from Houthi attacks, which have
forced commercial vessels to divert from the route that normally carries
12% of global trade.</p>
<p>CENTCOM said its strike on Friday was carried out “to protect freedom
of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure.”</p>
<p>“This continued malign and reckless behavior by the Iranian-backed
Houthis threatens regional stability and endangers the lives of mariners
across the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.”</p>
<p>The attacks have sent insurance costs spiraling for vessels
transiting the Red Sea and prompted many shipping firms to take the far
longer passage around the southern tip of Africa instead.</p>

id="what-is-a-gutenberg-bible-and-why-is-it-relevant-500-years-after-its-printing">What
is a Gutenberg Bible? And why is it relevant 500 years after its
printing?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — It’s not just a book.</p>
<p>Back in the 1450s, when the Bible became the first major work printed
in Europe with moveable metal type, Johannes Gutenberg was a man with a
plan.</p>
<p>The German inventor decided to make the most of his new technology —
the movable-type printing press — by producing an unprecedented version
of the scripture for wealthy customers who could interpret Latin:
leaders of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Though he planned on printing 150 Bibles, increasing demand motivated
him to produce 30 extra copies, which led to a total of 180. Currently
known as the “Gutenberg Bibles,” around 48 complete copies are
preserved.</p>
<p>None is known to be kept in private hands. Among those in the United
States, a paper Bible can be seen at the Morgan Library &amp; Museum, in
New York City. Two more copies in vellum lie in the underground vaults,
next to 120,000 other books.</p>
<p>Why should anyone — religiously observant or not — feel compelled to
see a Gutenberg Bible up close? Here’s a look at how its printing
influenced the history of books and the religious landscape. And what a
500-year-old volume can still reveal.</p>
<p>What is a Gutenberg Bible?</p>
<p>The term refers to each of the two-volume Bibles printed in
Gutenberg’s workshop around 1454.</p>
<p>Before that, all existing Bibles were copied by hand. The process
could take up to a year, said John McQuillen, associate curator at the
Morgan Library. In contrast, it is believed that Gutenberg completed his
work in about six months.</p>
<p>Each Gutenberg Bible has nearly 1,300 pages and weighs around 60
pounds. It’s written in Latin and printed in double columns, with 42
lines per page.</p>
<p>Most were printed on paper. A few others on animal skin.</p>
<p>When a Bible came off the press, only the black letters were printed.
Hand decorations and bindings were added later, depending on each
buyer’s taste and budget.</p>
<p>Some ornamentations were added in Germany. Others in France, Belgium
or Spain.</p>
<p>Therefore, each Gutenberg Bible is unique, McQuillen said.</p>
<p>Why were these Bibles a turning point?</p>
<p>Gutenberg’s invention produced a massive multiplication of complete
copies of biblical texts.</p>
<p>The first impact was among scholars and learned priests who had
easier access than ever before, said Richard Rex, professor of
Reformation History from the University of Cambridge.</p>
<p>“This massive multiplication even led to the wider adoption of the
term ‘Bible’ (Biblia) to describe the book,” Rex said. “Medieval authors
and others do speak sometimes of ‘the Bible’, but more commonly of
‘scripture.’”</p>
<p>Psychologically, Rex said, the appearance of the printed text — its
regularity, precision and uniformity — contributed to a tendency to
resolve theological arguments by reference to the biblical text
alone.</p>
<p>Later on, the printing of Bibles in vernacular languages — especially
from Luther’s Bible (early 1520s) and Tyndale’s New Testament (mid
1520s) onwards — affected the way that ordinary parishioners related to
religion and the clergy.</p>
<p>The limits of literacy still meant that access to the Bible was far
from universal. Gradually, though, religious leaders stopped being its
main interpreters.</p>
<p>“The phenomenon of lay people questioning or interpreting the
biblical text became more common from the 1520s onwards,” Rex said.
“Although the early Protestant Reformers, such as Luther, emphasized
that they did not seek to create an interpretative ‘free for all,’ this
was probably the predictable consequence of their appeal to ‘scripture
alone.’”</p>
<p>More than a book</p>
<p>Three times per year, a curator from the Morgan Library turns the
page of the Gutenberg Bible on display. It’s leaves not only tell a tale
of scripture, but of those who possessed it.</p>
<p>A few years ago, by studying its handmade initials, McQuillen was the
one to figure out the origin of its decoration: a German monastery that
no longer exists.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the 2000s, a Japanese researcher found little marks on
the surface of the Old Testament’s paper copy. Her findings revealed
that those leaves were used by Gutenberg’s successors for their own
edition, printed in 1462.</p>
<p>“For as many times as the Gutenberg Bible have been looked at, it
seems like every time a researcher comes in, something new can be
discovered,” McQuillen said.</p>
<p>“This book has existed for 500 years. Who are the people that have
touched it? How can we talk about these personal histories in addition
to the greater idea of what printing technology means on a European or
global scale?” he said.</p>
<p>Among the thousands of Bibles that J. P. Morgan acquired, owners made
various annotations. Individual names, birth dates, details that reflect
a personal story.</p>
<p>“A Bible is now sort of a book on the shelf,” McQuillen said. “But at
one point, this was a very personal object.”</p>
<p>“In a museum setting, they become art and a little bit distanced, but
we try to break that distance down.”</p>

<h2 id="everything-is-freeware">Everything is freeware</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-29, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;blockquote&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I think that with respect to content that’s already on the open web, the
social contract of that content since the ’90s has been that it is fair
use. Anyone can copy it, recreate with it, reproduce with it. That has
been “freeware,” if you like, that’s been the understanding.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Microsoft AI CEO—how many CEOs does Microsoft need?—Mustafa Suleyman
sure has an
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/28/24188391/microsoft-ai-suleyman-social-contract-freeware">interesting
take</a> on the web. I guess all the people sailing the high seas feel
vindicated now. I mean, he said it: content that’s already on the open
web is fair use if you want to copy it. I’m sure this is exactly what he
meant and I’m definitely not misinterpreting what he’s saying. After
all, all these companies are trying hard to follow both the literal and
also the spirit of the laws so it’s only fair for me to try hard to not
misinterpret their views am I right?
</p>
<p>
I also love that he used the term freeware and not free. Because the
wiki definition of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeware">Freeware</a> reads:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
There is no agreed-upon set of rights, license, or EULA that defines
freeware unambiguously; every publisher defines its own rules for the
freeware it offers. For instance, modification, redistribution by third
parties, and reverse engineering are permitted by some publishers but
prohibited by others.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>

id="if-your-immutable-linux-desktop-uses-flatpak-im-going-to-have-a-bad-time">If
your immutable Linux desktop uses Flatpak, I’m going to have a bad
time</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>The openSUSE project recently announced the second release candidate
(RC2) of its Aeon Desktop, formerly known as MicroOS Desktop GNOME.
Aside from the new coat of naming paint, Aeon breaks ground in a few
other ways by dabbling with technologies not found in other openSUSE
releases. The goal for Aeon is to provide automated system updates using
snapshots that can be applied atomically, removing the burden of system
maintenance for “lazy developers” who want to focus on their work rather
than desktop administration. System-tinkerers need not apply. The idea
behind Aeon, as with other immutable (or image-based) Linux
distributions, is to provide the core of the distribution as a read-only
image or filesystem that is updated atomically and can be rolled back if
needed. Google’s ChromeOS was the first popular Linux-based desktop
operating system to follow this model. Since the release of ChromeOS a
number of interesting immutable implementations have cropped up, such as
Fedora Silverblue, Project Bluefin (covered here in December 2023),
openSUSE’s MicroOS (covered here in March 2023), and Ubuntu Core. ↫ Joe
Brockmeier at LWN With the amount of attention immutable Linux desktops
are getting, and how much work and experimentation that’s going into
them, I’m getting the feeling that sooner or later all of the major,
popular desktop Linux distributions will be going this route. Depending
on implementation details, I actually like the concept of a defined base
system that’s just an image that can be replaced easily using btrfs
snapshots or something like that, while all the user’s files and
customisations are kept elsewhere. It makes intuitive sense. Where the
current crop of immutable Linux desktops fall flat for me is their
reliance on (usually) Flatpak. You know how there’s people who hate
systemd and/or Wayland just a little too much, to the point it gets a
little weird and worrying? That’s me whenever I have to deal with
Flatpaks. Every experience I have with Flatpaks is riddled with trouble
for me. Even though I’m a KDE user, I’m currently testing out the latest
GNOME release on my workstation (the one that I used to conclude Windows
is simply not ready for the desktop), using Fedora of course, and on
GNOME I use the Mastodon application Tuba. While I mostly write in
English, I do occasionally write in Dutch, too, and would love for the
spell check feature to work in my native tongue, too, instead of just in
English. However, despite having all possible Dutch dictionaries
installed – hunspell, aspell – and despite those dictionaries being
picked up everywhere else in GNOME, Tuba only showed me a long list of
variants of English. After digging around to find out why this was
happening, it took me far longer than I care to publicly admit to
realise that since the latest version of Tuba is only really available
as a Flatpak on Fedora, my problem probably had something to do with
that – and it turns out I was right: Flatpak applications do not use the
system-wide installed spellcheck dictionaries like normal applications
do. This eventually led me to this article by Daniel Aleksandersen,
where he details what you need to do in order to add spellcheck
dictionaries to Flatpak applications. You need to run the following
commands: The list of languages uses two-letter codes only, and the
first language listed will serve as the display language for Flatpak
applications, while the rest will be fallback languages – which happens
to include downloading and installing the Flatpak-specific copies of the
spellcheck libraries. Sadly, this method is not particularly granular.
Since it only accepts the two-letter codes, you can’t, say, only install
“nl-nl”; you’ll be getting “nl-be” as well. In the case of a widely
spoken language like English, this means a massive list of 18 different
varieties of English. The resulting menus are… Not elegant. This is just
an example, but using Flatpak, you’ll run into all kinds of issues like
this, that then have to be solved by hacks or obscure terminal commands
– not exactly the user-friendly image Flatpak is trying to convey to the
world. This particular issue might not matter to the probably
overwhelming English-speaking majority of Flatpak developers, but for
anyone who has to deal with multiple languages on a daily basis – which
is a massive number of people, probably well over 50% of computer users
– having to mess around with obscure terminal commands hidden in blog
posts just to be able to use the languages they use every day is
terrible design on a multitude of levels, and will outright make Flatpak
applications unusable for large numbers of people. Whenever I run into
these Flatpak problems, it makes it clear to me that Flatpak is designed
not by users, for users – but by developers, for developers. I can
totally understand and see why Flatpak is appealing to developers, but
as a user, they bring me nothing but grief, issues, and weird bugs that
all seem to stem from being made to make developers’ lives easier,
instead of users’. If immutable Linux distributions are really hellbent
on using Flatpak as the the means of application installation – and it
seams like they are – it will mean a massive regression in
functionality, usability, and discoverability for users, and as long as
Flatpak remains as broken and badly designed as it is, I really see no
reason to recommend an immutable Linux desktop to anyone but the really
curious among us.</p>

<h2 id="biden-trump-debate-draws-48m-tv-viewers">Biden-Trump debate
draws 48M TV viewers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — Roughly 48 million TV viewers tuned in to watch Thursday’s
U.S. presidential debate between Democratic President Joe Biden and
Republican rival Donald Trump, according to preliminary Nielsen
data.</p>
<p>The number suggests the final audience will be about one-third less
than the 73 million people who watched the candidates’ first face-off in
2020, and among the three lowest-rated first presidential debates since
1976.</p>
<p>The relatively low number compared with past debates in recent
election cycles could be indicative of low voter enthusiasm for both
candidates. It does not capture the full extent of online viewing, which
has grown in popularity as traditional TV audiences decline.</p>
<p>Media experts were looking to see how a new format by host CNN would
play out, and whether it would provide a template for future debates.
The restrictions of that format, which included the option for CNN to
mute the candidates’ microphones, imposed some discipline on the
candidates and should be emulated by other networks, three media experts
said.</p>
<p>CNN, which held the exclusive rights to present the debate, allowed
candidates two minutes for each answer and one minute for rebuttals, and
muted their microphones if they exceeded those limits. The studio did
not have an audience, and moderators Dana Bash and Jake Tapper did not
fact-check the candidates in real time.</p>
<p>CNN defended itself against the criticism from some media
commentators that the absence of real-time fact-checking allowed both
candidates to spread false claims.</p>
<p>“The role of the moderators is to present the candidates with
questions that are important to American voters and to facilitate a
debate, enabling candidates to make their case and challenge their
opponent,” a CNN spokesperson said in a statement.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>When someone tells you who they are, believe them. Microsoft’s AI
chief Mustafa Suleyman: With respect to content that is already on the
open web, the social contract of that content since the ’90s has been
that it is fair use. Anyone can copy it, recreate with it, reproduce
with it. That has been freeware, if you like. That’s been the
understanding. ↫ Mustafa Suleyman This is absolute bullshit from the
first word to the very last. None of this is true – not even in the
slightest. Content on the web is not free for the taking by anyone,
especially not to be chewed up and regurgitated verbatim by spicy
autocomplete tools. There is no “social contract” to that effect. In
fact, when I go to any of Microsoft’s website, documents, videos, or any
other content they publish online, on the open web, and scroll to the
very bottom of the page, it’s all got the little copyright symbol or
similar messaging. Once again, this underlines how entitled Silicon
Valley techbros really are. If we violate even a gram of Microsoft’s
copyrights, we’d have their lawyers on our ass in weeks – but when
Microsoft itself needs to violate copyright and licensing on an
automated, industrial scale, for massive profits, everything is suddenly
peace, love, and fair use. Men in Silicon Valley just do not understand
consent. At all. And they show this time and time again. Meanwhile, the
Internet Archive has to deal with crap like this: The lawsuit is about
the longstanding and widespread library practice of controlled digital
lending, which is how we lend the books we own to our patrons. As a
result of the publishers’ lawsuit, more than 500,000 books have been
removed from our lending library. ↫ Chris Freeland at the Internet
Archive Blogs Controlled lending without a profit motive is deemed
illegal, but violating copyright and licensing on an automated,
industrial scale is fair use. Make it make sense. Make it make
sense.</p>

graphics: more than you wanted to know</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Apple ][ is one of the most iconic vintage computers of all time.
But since Wozniak’s monster lasted all the way until 1993 (1995 if you
could the IIe card, which I won’t count until I get one), it can be easy
to forget that in 1977, it was a video extravaganza. The competitors–
even much bigger and established companies like Commodore and Tandy–
generally only had text modes, let alone pixel-addressable graphics, and
they certainly didn’t have sixteen colors. (Gray and grey are different
colors, right?) ↫ Nicole Branagan If there’s ever anything you wanted to
know about how graphics work on the Apple II, this is the place to go.
It’s an incredibly detailed and illustrated explanation of how the
machine renders and displays graphics, and an excellent piece of writing
to boot. I’m a little jealous.</p>

<h2 id="us-allies-warn-of-north-korea-russia-military-cooperation">US,
allies warn of North Korea-Russia military cooperation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — The United States and its allies warned Friday that
expanding military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is
dangerous, illegal and a growing threat to the wider international
community.</p>
<p>“Last week, Russian and DPRK leaders signed a ‘Treaty on
Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,’ paving the way for further
deepening their military cooperation,” Robert Wood, U.S. deputy U.N.
ambassador, told reporters, surrounded by representatives of nearly 50
like-minded countries.</p>
<p>“We are deeply concerned about the security implications of the
advancement of this cooperation for Europe, the Korean Peninsula, the
Indo-Pacific region and around the world.”</p>
<p>DPRK is the abbreviation for North Korea’s official name, the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.</p>
<p>Wood spoke ahead of a meeting of the U.N. Security Council requested
by the United States, Britain, France, Japan and South Korea to discuss
North Korea’s transfer of arms and munitions to Russia, which are
helping drive the Kremlin’s war machine in Ukraine. Such transfers would
violate a U.N. arms embargo on North Korea.</p>
<p>“Before February 2022, it was hard to imagine that the war in Ukraine
would pose such a direct threat to the security of the Korean
Peninsula,” South Korean Ambassador Joonkook Hwang told council members.
“But now we are facing a new reality.”</p>
<p>He said South Korea’s national defense ministry has assessed that
since North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir
Putin held a summit in Russia in September, Pyongyang has shipped at
least 10,000 containers to Russia that can hold a total of as many as 5
million artillery shells. His government has also determined that
122-millimeter artillery shells made in North Korea were included in the
weapons Russia has used against Ukraine.</p>
<p>In return for the weapons, North Korea is seeking trade and military
assistance from Russia, which would violate U.N. sanctions. It is also
benefiting from Russia’s political protection in the Security
Council.</p>
<p>“All these developments can bring about a shift in the global
security landscape, and the potential long-term effects are dangerously
uncertain,” Hwang said, adding that Seoul would “resolutely respond” to
any threats to its security in a “prudent and measured” way.</p>
<p>U.N. sanctions experts detailed prohibited transfers of military
equipment and munitions from North Korea to Russia in a report in
February — which Moscow denied. Russia then used its Security Council
veto to shut down the 14-year-old monitoring panel in April.</p>
<p>Russia’s envoy again dismissed accusations it is getting weapons from
North Korea at Friday’s meeting.</p>
<p>“This is completely false,” Vassily Nebenzia told the council, adding
that the two countries’ cooperation “is exclusively constructive and
legitimate in nature.”</p>
<p>Nebenzia dismissed the panel of experts’ findings as controlled and
directed by the West.</p>
<p>“The panel of experts have been following those orders given them and
turning in the direction they were told to turn,” he said.</p>
<p>North Korea’s envoy defended Pyongyang and Moscow’s treaty, saying
relations between the two countries “are completely peace-loving and
defensive in nature.”</p>
<p>“Therefore, there is no reason whatsoever to be concerned about
development of their bilateral relations, unless they have intention to
undertake a military invasion of the DPRK and Russian Federation,”
Ambassador Song Kim said.</p>
<p>China, which has traditionally been North Korea’s closest ally,
expressed concern about heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>“China calls on parties concerned to be rational and pragmatic and to
find joint efforts to find a solution,” Deputy Ambassador Geng Shuang
said.</p>
<p>Washington’s envoy urged Beijing to use its influence with both
Pyongyang and Moscow to persuade them to cease their “increasingly
dangerous cooperation.”</p>
<p>“So I appeal to my Chinese colleague to understand that if indeed the
situation on the Korean Peninsula continues on the trajectory it’s
going, the United States and its allies will have to take steps to
defend their security,” Wood said.</p>

<h2 id="worlds-largest-naval-exercise-sends-message-to-china">World’s
largest naval exercise sends message to China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>pentagon — The United States and 28 partner nations have begun the
world’s largest naval war exercise off the shores of Hawaii, known as
the Rim of the Pacific, or RIMPAC. </p>
<p>This year’s exercise brings international cooperation on a scale like
no other: 40 surface ships, more than 150 aircraft, three submarines and
25,000 people.</p>
<p>Nations from around the globe are practicing a wide range of
missions, from natural disaster response to attack skills needed for
war. While most participants are nations with Pacific coastlines, this
year’s RIMPAC also includes non-Pacific nations, including the United
Kingdom, France, Brazil and Israel.</p>
<p>“Every nation in the world that has interests in the Pacific and will
adhere to the same values is more than welcome to participate,”
said Chilean Navy Commodore Alberto Guerrero, RIMPAC deputy
commander.</p>
<p>One country not invited? China.</p>
<p>Why? Because the warm welcome RIMPAC gave to China in 2014 and 2016
backfired, according to Markus Garlauskas, director of the Indo-Pacific
Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council.</p>
<p>“There was this outreach to China, and definitely the U.S. and its
allies and partners were essentially burned by the Chinese taking
advantage of it … as an opportunity to essentially collect intelligence
and to try and get more acceptance of what should be considered
unacceptable behavior,” Garlauskas told VOA.</p>
<p>Since China’s last RIMPAC in 2016, he said, Beijing ramped up its
aggressive behavior, building and militarizing more artificial islands
in international waters, conducting aggressive maneuvers around Taiwan
in recent months and pummeling Philippine ships with water cannons in
recent days.</p>
<p>But the biennial exercise, officials say, can send a strong message
to China to stop bullying its neighbors. RIMPAC nations this year will
practice targeting the decommissioned assault ship USS Tarawa, in a rare
chance to learn how effective their weapons are at sinking a large and
protected adversary in open waters. </p>
<p>“They’re not just going to be facing the United States in the country
they’re targeting, but they’re potentially going to have to deal with a
response from a wide range of countries that have common interests in
deterring and confronting Chinese aggression as threats to a free and
open Indo-Pacific,” Garlauskas said.</p>
<p>Israel’s inclusion this year sparked calls from pro-Palestinian
activists wanting countries to skip the exercise in protest. Malaysia’s
prime minister addressed the protesters ahead of the exercises, saying
that while his country would continue to speak out in support of the
Palestinian people, Malaysia needed to act in a way that was “not driven
by anger,” while also considering the practical implications of missing
the major military exercise.</p>
<p>RIMPAC is set to end in early August.</p>

not unusual to port the Linux Vector Packet Processor (VPP) to
FreeBSD</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Vector Packet Processor (VPP) is a framework for moving packets
around at high rates. Its core concept is handling packets in groups
known as “vectors,” which allows for the native use of vector processor
instructions for packet classification and processing in different CPU
architectures — currently amd64 and arm64. VPP can process packets at
incredibly high rates and competes with many dedicated forwarding
appliances. This is achieved using userspace networking that bypasses
the host’s normal network stack. This article describes the porting of
VPP to FreeBSD and working with the upstream VPP project to include
FreeBSD as a supported target. ↫ Tom Jones It’s not unusual for me to

<h2 id="what-happens-after-chevron">What Happens After Chevron?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUxNjczNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODY5MjA3OH0.vuyCBLSJbd_ee3X8Ot8T3q0giZ73SgCWoDq7OaqgqPQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
It’s a sad day for the regulatory state. On Friday, the Supreme Court
struck down a 40-year-old precedent that deferred to agencies’
interpretations of their own mandates where the statutory guidance was
incomplete or ambiguous, otherwise known as <em><em>Chevron</em></em>
deference, after the losing side in the original case. Not only has it
been cited in
<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/loper-bright-and-relentless-ending-judicial-deference-to-cement-judicial-activism-in-the-courts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than 19,000</u></a> federal opinions, it’s the one congressional aides —
the ones actually writing the laws — are most familiar with, as Lisa
Heinzerling, a professor of environmental law at Georgetown Law, told
me.
</p>
<p>
“So there’s a way in which Congress has been relying on
<em><em>Chevron</em></em> for decades, right?” she said. “If Congress
banked on <em><em>Chevron</em></em>, banked on the idea that if they
didn’t make things clear the agency would take care of it, then that
reliance is not being honored.”
</p>
<p>
This is not the first time the court has come for regulators. Two years
ago, in <em><em>West Virginia v. Environmental Protection
Agency</em></em>, the court held that the authority to resolve questions
of interpretation involving high-stakes political and economic
questions, a.k.a. “major questions,” rests with Congress, not the
agencies, raising the threat of legal nightmares should regulators
attempt to take any kind of big swings. This explicitly concerns only
“extraordinary cases,” and yet regulators already appear to be
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/epa-rules-biden" target="_self"><u>reining
in</u></a> their own ambition to gird against potential challenges.
</p>
<p>
Friday’s decision comes the day after the court
<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-859new_kjfm.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>struck
down</u></a> a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act giving certain
enforcement powers to the Securities and Exchange Commission and granted
a stay on enforcement of the Environmental Protection Agency’s “good
neighbor” rule, aimed at preventing harmful pollution from crossing
state lines.
</p>
<p>
The two cases decided this week — <em><em>Loper Bright Enterprises et
al. v. Raimondo</em></em>, <em>Secretary of Commerce, et al.</em> and
<em><em>Relentless, Inc. v. Department of Commerce</em></em> — turned on
whether private commercial fishing companies could be compelled to pay
for federal monitors to ride along and ensure they were complying with
applicable fishing rules. Or at least they did initially. “The court
decided to decide <em><em>only</em></em> the question whether to
overrule <em><em>Chevron</em></em>, the case that establishes deference
for agencies legal interpretations,” Heinzerling explained the day
before the ruling came down. Our conversation has been edited for length
and clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Without
</strong><em><strong><em>Chevron</em></strong></em><strong>, are we
going to get completely bogged down in revising statutes? Are our courts
going to be clogged up with nuisance suits from people who simply don’t
want to have to follow the rules?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I think there will be a lot of efforts to undo other precedent that
relied on <em><em>Chevron</em></em> — and especially paired with the
<a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2023/22-1008" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Corner
Post</em></em></u><u> case</u></a>, which has to do with the timing of
challenges to agency action. You know, realistically, if that case comes
down, accepting a longer period of time in which to sue people could go
nuts, challenging all sorts of agency interpretations from the past. So
that’s disruptive.
</p>
<p>
The Supreme Court is constantly saying, well, go and get a new statute.
Well, okay, we saw what happens when Congress passes a new statute: The
court holds it unconstitutional. The Dodd-Frank Act. Look what happened
to the Affordable Care Act. These major pieces of legislation, major,
major political stakes, and the court has not respected those. So I feel
like we’re kind of in a shell game, something that’s not quite honest.
That in all of these cases, actually, Congress did pass a law, but the
court either rules it unconstitutional, says it’s not clear enough. And
so I don’t think they’re respecting Congress’s handiwork as it exists
now.
</p>
<p>
<strong>You mentioned </strong><em><strong><em>Corner
Post</em></strong></em><strong>, could you talk about that
case?</strong>
</p>
<p>
It came to the court kind of quietly. It’s got
<a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/truck-stop-sleeper-case-could-open-old-rules-to-new-lawsuits" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rich
backers</u></a>. It’s just a little truckstop, just like the
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/16/climate/koch-chevron-deference-supreme-court.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>commercial
fisherman</u></a>, that wants to challenge a rule on credit cards. They
were incorporated after the rule went into effect, and they want to say,
we weren’t injured when it first passed, so we should get the benefit of
a longer period of time in which to sue. And amazingly, the justices
seemed willing to accept that. That just adds to the stakes of
overruling <em><em>Chevron</em></em>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The </strong><em><strong><em>Chevron</em></strong></em><strong>
deference is a big part of how agencies do their job. But after West
Virginia, does it still matter? I’m not a lawyer, but I’m going to
pretend I am one when I ask: Does the major questions doctrine
effectively invalidate </strong><em><strong><em>Chevron
anyway</em></strong></em><strong>?</strong>
</p>
<p>
No. They said that the major questions idea was for extraordinary cases,
to see how it turns out over the years, but it’s not every case. Where
<em><em>Chevron</em></em> applied, theoretically, in every case. At
least it was a mix.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What recent regulatory decisions would be most vulnerable in a
post-</strong><em><strong><em>Chevron</em></strong></em><strong>
world?</strong>
</p>
<p>
It is complicated to know because it has to be a question about a
statute, a question about a statute that a court finds ambiguous, right?
That’s where <em><em>Chevron</em></em> would have helped. And I think it
depends on what court you’re in. If you’re in the Fifth Circuit, there’s
a good chance — I mean, they’ve just stopped using
<em><em>Chevron</em></em>, period.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Is there a world in which courts develop more subject matter
expertise as a result of being forced to decide on questions of
statutory interpretation?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Over the years people have offered the possibility of science courts or
environmental courts — specialized courts where adjudicators have
expertise. That’s never really taken off — never really at all taken
off. Certainly the D.C. Circuit judges handle administrative cases all
the time. Cases go exclusively to them, and I think the judges do
develop some expertise. But it doesn’t turn them into ecologists or
engineers. And the thing is that the structure of a judicial chambers is
both tiny and insular: you have one judge; on the Supreme Court four
clerks, but elsewhere two to three. It’s just not that much. Whereas
EPA, they have teams of people on these rules from all over the agency,
and then the rule gets reviewed by others.
</p>
<p>
<strong>We’re obviously focused on climate-related regulations, but is
there an area of policy that you think will be most vulnerable
immediately without
</strong><em><strong><em>Chevron</em></strong></em><strong>?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The hallmarks of where <em><em>Chevron</em></em> has been really
important: complicated statutes; technical and/or scientific subject
matter; places where the language is either vague or just broad enough,
it’s not clear how to fill it in. That’s environmental law, but there’s
a lot of other law that’s also … I mean, it’s just OSHA, FDA, the FTC.
Looking for those signature traits, that’s going to be a place where it
pinches particularly hard. I think the agencies now are sort of bracing
for this, but they still have a lot of rules in the works, and this is
going to come down in the middle of that <em><em>in election
year</em></em>.
</p>
<p>
<em><strong><em>Chevron</em></strong></em><strong> started with Reagan
wanting to change the way the EPA interpreted its mandate. Would
removing it potentially make things more difficult for an incoming Trump
administration?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I mean, it should. <em><em>Chevron</em></em> was supposed to work that
way. But certainly the major questions doctrine, at least as it’s been
practiced, so far cuts only against ambitious regulation. It doesn’t cut
in favor of it.
</p>
<p>
The thing that worries me is the anti-regulatory skew that’s in some of
the court’s other recent rulings. So for example, in <em><em>West
Virginia</em></em> itself, the Supreme Court struck down Obama’s Clean
Power Plan but upheld — without even explaining why — Trump’s plan. They
were the same question under the same statute with the same evidence,
the same costs and benefits. Everything was the same except for the
direction. If one was a major question, the other should have been a
major question. And so if you want to put it in the terms of these two
possible administrations, they will go after Biden rules more than
they’ll go after Trump rules, at least on the major questions idea.

offers deportation relief to additional 309,000 Haitians in country

<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Biden administration will expand deportation relief
and work permits to an estimated 309,000 Haitians in the country
already, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Friday.  </p>
<p>The administration will expand access to the Temporary Protected
Status program to Haitians through February 2026 because of violence and
security issues in Haiti that limits access to safety, health care, food
and water, the department said. The expanded program will be available
to Haitians in the U.S. on or before June 3. </p>
<p>About 264,000 Haitians in the U.S. were already covered by the
program, according to the U.S. government.  </p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat seeking another term in the
November 5 elections, has walked a political tightrope when it comes to
immigration, both trying to step up security at the U.S.-Mexico border
and take a more humane approach to immigrants in the U.S.
illegally. </p>
<p>In a presidential debate on Thursday, Biden’s Republican challenger,
former president Donald Trump, criticized Biden for failing to stem high
levels of illegal immigration. </p>
<p>Gang wars in Haiti have displaced over half a million people and
nearly 5 million are facing severe food insecurity. Armed groups, which
now control most of the capital, have formed a broad alliance while
carrying out widespread killings, ransom kidnappings and sexual
violence.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court dealt a major blow to federal
regulatory power on Friday by overturning a 1984 precedent that had
given deference to government agencies in interpreting laws they
administer, handing a defeat to President Joe Biden’s
administration.</p>
<p>The justices ruled 6-3 in favor of fishing companies that challenged
a government-run program partly funded by industry that monitored
overfishing of herring off New England’s coast.</p>
<p>It marked the latest decision in recent years powered by the Supreme
Court’s conservative majority that hemmed in the authority of federal
agencies.</p>
<p>The precedent that the court overturned arose from a ruling involving
oil company Chevron that had called for judges to defer to reasonable
federal agency interpretations of U.S. laws deemed to be ambiguous. This
doctrine, long opposed by conservatives and business interests, was
called “Chevron deference.”</p>
<p>The decreasing productivity of Congress – thanks to its gaping
partisan divide – has led to a growing reliance, especially by
Democratic presidents, on rules issued by U.S. agencies to realize
regulatory goals.</p>
<p>The 1984 precedent, set in a ruling involving oil company Chevron,
has called for judges to defer to federal agency interpretations of U.S.
laws that are deemed to be ambiguous.</p>
<p>This doctrine, long opposed by conservatives and business interests,
is called “Chevron deference.”</p>
<p>Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration had defended the
National Marine Fisheries Service regulation at issue and the Chevron
deference doctrine. The fish conservation program was started in 2020
under Republican former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The regulation called for certain commercial fishermen to carry
aboard their vessels U.S. government contractors and pay for their
at-sea services while they monitored the catch.  </p>
<p>The companies – led by New Jersey-based Loper Bright Enterprises and
Rhode Island-based Relentless Inc – in 2020 sued the fisheries service,
claiming the monitoring program exceeded the Commerce Department
agency’s authority.</p>
<p>The bid by the fishermen was supported by various conservative and
corporate interest groups including billionaire Charles Koch’s network.
The litigation is part of what has been termed the “war on the
administrative state,” an effort to weaken the federal agency
bureaucracy that interprets laws, crafts federal rules and implements
executive action.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, has signaled
skepticism toward expansive regulatory power, issuing rulings in recent
years to rein in what its conservative justices have viewed as overreach
by the Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies.</p>
<p>The fish conservation program aimed to monitor 50 percent of declared
herring fishing trips in the regulated area, with program costs split
between the federal government and the fishing industry. The cost to
commercial fishermen of paying for the monitoring was an estimated $710
per day for 19 days a year, which could reduce a vessel’s income by up
to 20 percent, according to government figures.</p>
<p>The Biden administration said the program was authorized under a 1976
federal law called the Magnuson-Stevens Act to protect against
overfishing in U.S. coastal waters. It said in court papers the program
was suspended for the fishing year starting in April 2023 due to
insufficient federal funding.</p>
<p>The Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit and the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
both ruled in favor of the government.</p>
<p>The Biden administration said Chevron deference among other things
“gives due weight to the expertise that agencies bring to bear” and
promotes national uniformity in the administration of federal law.</p>
<p>An attorney for the commercial fishermen said Chevron deference
“incentivizes a dynamic where Congress does far less than the Framers
[of the U.S. Constitution] anticipated, and the executive branch is left
to do far more by deciding controversial issues via regulatory
fiat.”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has issued other rulings this term involving the
scope of agency powers, including two rulings on Thursday. It rejected
the Securities and Exchange Commission’s in-house enforcement of laws
protecting investors against securities fraud. It also blocked an
Environmental Protection Agency regulation aimed at reducing ozone
emissions that may worsen air pollution in neighboring states.</p>
<p>The justices on May 16 upheld the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau’s funding mechanism in a challenge brought by the payday loan
industry.</p>

Supreme Court backs anti-camping laws used against homeless people</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court upheld on Friday anti-camping
laws used by authorities in an Oregon city to stop homeless people from
sleeping in public parks and public streets — a ruling that gives local
and state governments a freer hand in confronting a national
homelessness crisis. </p>
<p>The justices ruled 6-3 to overturn a lower court’s decision that
found that enforcing the ordinances in the city of Grants Pass when no
shelter space is available for the homeless violates the U.S.
Constitution’s Eighth Amendment prohibition on “cruel and unusual”
punishments. Various jurisdictions employ similar laws. </p>
<p>The court’s conservative justices were in the majority, while its
three liberal members dissented. </p>
<p>Justice Neil Gorsuch, who authored the ruling, wrote, “Homelessness
is complex. Its causes are many. So may be the public policy responses
required to address it. At bottom, the question this case presents is
whether the Eighth Amendment grants federal judges primary
responsibility for assessing those causes and devising those responses.
It does not.” </p>
<p>Homelessness remains a multifaceted problem for public officials in
the United States as many municipalities experience chronic shortages of
affordable housing. On any given night, more than 600,000 people are
homeless, according to U.S. government estimates. </p>
<p>The case focused on three ordinances in Grants Pass, a city of
roughly 38,000 people in southwestern Oregon, that together prohibit
sleeping in public streets, alleyways and parks while using a blanket or
bedding. Violators are fined $295. Repeat offenders can be criminally
prosecuted for trespassing, punishable by up to 30 days in jail. </p>
<p>Advocates for the homeless, various liberal legal groups and other
critics have said laws like these criminalize people simply for being
homeless and for actions they cannot avoid, such as sleeping in public.
They point to a 1962 Supreme Court ruling that the Eighth Amendment
barred punishing individuals based on their status rather than their
conduct. </p>
<p>A point of contention during the Supreme Court’s arguments in the
case in April was whether homelessness can be deemed a status that would
prohibit enforcing local laws. </p>
<p>President Joe Biden’s administration agreed with the plaintiffs that
Grants Pass cannot enforce an “absolute ban” on sleeping in the city —
which effectively criminalizes homelessness — but suggested the rulings
by the lower courts against the city were too broad and should be
reconsidered. </p>
<p>Proponents including various government officials have called such
laws a necessary tool for maintaining public safety.  </p>
<p>The case, which began in 2018, involved three homeless people who
filed a class-action lawsuit seeking to block the measures impacting
them in Grants Pass. One of the plaintiffs has since died. </p>
<p>U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark Clarke ruled that the city’s “policy and
practice of punishing homelessness” violates the Eighth Amendment and
barred it from enforcing the anti-camping ordinances. The San
Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Clarke’s
injunction against the ordinances. </p>
<p>The city had defended itself in the case in part by noting that
homeless people have alternatives outside the city, including nearby
undeveloped federal land, county campsites or state rest stops. The
judge said that argument “sheds light on the city’s attitude towards its
homeless citizens” by seeking to drive them out or punish them if they
stay.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Advocates for televised presidential debates argue that they offer the
best chance voters will have during the campaign to get an extended look
at the candidates, beyond what they see in 30-second ads and 8-second
sound bites. We can hear them defend their records as they critique
their opponents, and answer tough questions from seasoned reporters
about key issues. It’s a rare opportunity to delve deep into substance
on important issues.
</p>
<p>
If only that were how televised debates actually turn out. The one
exchange on climate change that occurred in Thursday’s meeting between
Joe Biden and Donald Trump showed just how problematic a forum for voter
education this is.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps we should be thankful that Biden and Trump were asked a single
question about climate, since one is certainly more than zero.
Unfortunately, to consider what ensued at all enlightening, you’d have
to have a pretty low bar.
</p>
<p>
“Will you take any action as president to slow the climate crisis?”
co-moderator Dana Bash asked Trump. “Let me just go back to what he said
about the police,” Trump responded, then rambled for a while on a number
of topics, none of which were climate change. So Bash tried again:
“Thirty-eight seconds left, President Trump, will you take any action as
president to slow the climate crisis?” Trump’s answer was characteristic
gobbledygook:
</p>
<p>
“I want absolutely immaculate clean water. And I want absolutely clean
air and we had it. We had H2O. We had the best numbers ever, and we did
— we were using all forms of energy, all forms, everything. And yet,
during my four years I had the best environmental numbers ever, and my
top environmental people gave me that statistic just before I walked on
the stage, actually.”
</p>
<p>
Though no viewer would have any idea
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-debate-best-environmental-numbers" target="_self"><u>what
Trump was talking about</u></a> with “the best environmental numbers
ever,” I believe I know what he was referring to: Before the debate,
Trump
<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112689786167440697" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>posted</u></a>
on Truth Social some suggested talking points he got from Andrew
Wheeler, the coal lobbyist he appointed to lead the Environmental
Protection Agency, including that Trump should mention that carbon
emissions went down while he was president. It’s
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>true</u></a>
that emissions dipped in 2020, when you may remember there was a
pandemic that shut down much of the economy. That did not, however,
answer the question of what actions he would take in a second term.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps marveling at Trump’s claim that “we had H2O” when he was
president, Biden took a moment to respond. “I don’t know where the hell
he’s been,” the president finally said. “I passed the most extensive
climate change legislation in history.” It would have helped viewers
unfamiliar with the climate provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act if
Biden had at least mentioned some of them, such as money for research
into new sources of clean energy, incentives for domestic manufacturing
of green technology, grants to help farmers cut emissions, and tax
credits for electric vehicles and home electrification. After a
digression into HBCUs, Biden returned to the issue: “He hadn’t done a
damn thing for the environment. He pulled out of the Paris peace —
Climate Accord. I immediately joined it, because if we reach 1.5 degrees
Celsius at any one point there’s no way back. The only existential
threat to humanity is climate change, and he didn’t do a damn thing
about it. He wants to undo all that I’ve done.”
</p>
<p>
All of which is true, if probably too vague for most viewers to fully
understand. But it did include a statement conveying the seriousness of
the challenge (“The only existential threat to humanity is climate
change”), and reference to some relevant facts. That led Trump to a
criticism of the Paris agreement, that it’s “a rip-off of the United
States.”
</p>
<p>
But any viewer not familiar with the details of the agreement would have
had trouble following what Trump said; he seemed to be objecting to the
fact that the agreement called on developed countries to help less
developed countries adapt; he claimed that the agreement “was going to
cost us a trillion dollars,” one of many fictitious numbers he tossed
out. That left Biden to conclude that “we have made significant
progress” under his administration, and tout his new
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-american-climate-corps" target="_self"><u>Climate
Corps</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
In all, it wasn’t the least substantive exchange on climate one could
imagine. A viewer who knew absolutely nothing about either of the
candidates’ records would have learned that they disagree on the Paris
agreement, and that Biden believes climate change is an existential
threat. But as with the rest of this debate — and almost every televised
debate — the best one can say from the standpoint of policy substance
is, “That could have been worse.”
</p>
<p>
And now that there has been one climate question, chances are the
moderators of the second debate will ignore the issue altogether. The
prevailing view among political reporters is that, sure, climate is
important, but the voters just don’t care about it all that much.
Convinced by
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/climate-inflation-poll" target="_self"><u>polls</u></a>
showing that other issues rank higher when voters are asked what their
most important priorities are, they usually segregate climate coverage
apart from the political stories that will dominate the news between now
and November.
</p>
<p>
That creates a self-fulfilling prophecy: When news organizations run a
thousand stories saying “Inflation dominates voter concerns” and then
ask voters what their concerns are, most of them are going to talk about
what seems to be on the political agenda. It’s not exactly a conspiracy
to downplay climate as an issue in the presidential race, but it has
much the same effect.
</p>
<p>
The savvy observer might suggest that it doesn’t really matter, since we
know where the two candidates stand on climate change and the contrast
couldn’t be clearer. And those of us who pay a great deal of attention
to both politics and the climate issue do understand the difference. But
that describes only a small portion of the electorate, which was why
this debate was another missed opportunity. Even if it could have been
worse.

<li>Biden squanders his climate moment at presidential debate
</h3>
<p>
Well, last night’s first 2024 debate between President Biden and Donald
Trump was “altogether distressing,”
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/biden-trump-debate-paris-agreement?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_OSIOOhMAtwMIG46JMD9Cs_8otg3hDsgzRtiHq1c7jHGSnHtxewqYaOQjmxNqxvX5IedsT" rel="noopener" target="_self">writes
Heatmap’s Katie Brigham</a>. And while climate was far from the main
focus, the two candidates did have one notable exchange. Trump initially
dodged a question about whether he would take action to slow the climate
crisis, then briefly noted “I want absolutely immaculate clean water and
I want absolutely clean air. And we had it. We had H2O.” Biden responded
by criticizing Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement. “I
immediately [re]joined, because if we reach 1.5 degrees Celsius, at any
one point, there’s no way back,” Biden said. “The only existential
threat to humanity is climate change. And he didn’t do a damn thing
about it.”
</p>
<p>
Making Paris the focus of the debate’s one exchange around climate was
an odd choice, Brigham says. According to a poll conducted last November
by Heatmap, only 35% of Americans say they are at least “somewhat
familiar” with the Paris Agreement. The Inflation Reduction Act, Biden’s
signature piece of climate legislation, didn’t come up once. (Not that
they’re that

that resonate with Americans, none of which were mentioned,” Brigham
adds.

an EPA environmental rule while it is challenged in a lower court. The
so-called good neighor plan would impose strict emissions limits on
power plants and other industrial sources in 23 states, and was intended
to prevent dangerous pollution that can cause breathing problems from
drifting across state lines. The rule has been challenged by a number of
Republican states, as well as companies. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote that
those challenges were “likely to succeed on a claim that the Good
Neighbor Plan is ’arbitrary” or “capricious.’” The ruling blocks the EPA
from ramping up pollution limits while the challenges are being heard.
According to the EPA, the plan would prevent 1,300 premature deaths and
cut down on ER visits.

In a separate decision, the Interior Department also said it would
protect 28 million acres of land in Alaska that former President Donald
Trump had tried to make available for drilling and mining. President
Biden has a goal of conserving 30% of U.S. lands and waters.

movements and uncertainty in American politics</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
A rule of thumb is that market players don’t like uncertainty. The
question this morning is whether there’s more or less of it in the wake
of President Joe Biden’s rough showing against former President Donald
Trump during last night’s debate. We’ll track how the debate is
affecting the movement of money. Plus, Social Security cuts are
inevitable by 2035 unless lawmakers act. Can a similar crunch from the
’80s offer guidance?

<h2>
Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?
</h2>
<p>
I grew up on a ranch in West Texas. Horses, rodeo, and roping were my
life. I was going to be a horse trainer. Then, when my life took a left
turn in high school, I got much more serious about music, started
writing songs, and ended up pursuing a music degree at the University of
North Texas.
</p>
<p>
After college, I had a 3-year stint in Portland, Oregon, where I started
the band
<a href="https://alisonwilder.net/voodoo-economics-accept-no-imitations/">Voodoo
Economics</a>. My bandmates and I moved to Philly in 2004-ish, where I
wrote for, played in, and produced for Voodoo while completing a
Master’s in music theory at Temple University. After a few years of
adjunct teaching, I decided a PhD in music theory &amp; cognition at
McGill University in Montreal was the right move, so I went off to do
that. The timing was epically bad – this was the beginning of the end of
the humanities in North American universities, after all – and I
realized after about a year that it would be nearly impossible to get a
job in a place where I actually wanted to live. So I packed up the piano
yet again and headed back to Philadelphia.
</p>
<p>
Back in Philly, I co-founded a music tech company with a super-cool and
interesting composer/pianist/technologist named Greg Wilder. After a
whirlwind couple of years in the depths of the music industry, we
decided to move away from daily ops with that company, and I was very
much at loose ends. I had never had any real marketable skills (don’t
try to tell me songwriting and music theory are marketable!), and I had
no idea what to do. So I asked Greg, <em>“What should I do?”</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>“Learn Linux,”</em> he said.
</p>
<p>
So I wiped my laptop, installed Debian, and was off to the races. Then I
said, <em>“but what should I do with Linux?”</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>“Maybe WordPress?”</em> he said.
</p>
<p>
It was 2011, and the timing couldn’t have been better. I learned
WordPress, started faffing about in PHP, Javascript, and all the rest,
and somehow people started writing checks. Over the last 13 years, Greg
and I have turned my faffing about into a couple of real businesses
(<a href="https://punktdigital.com/">Punkt Digital</a> and
<a href="https://wickedgoodweb.com/">Wicked Good Web</a>). At some point
during all of that, we got married, moved to New Hampshire, divorced,
and stayed best friends.
</p>
<p>
Though I stopped music completely for about 7 years after the start-up
(relationship status: it’s complicated), I’ve spent the last 6 years or
so building my studio back up and pouring myself into songwriting and
producing again (<a href="https://blixbyrd.bandcamp.com/">Blix Byrd</a>
and <a href="https://doctorbody.bandcamp.com/">Doctor Body</a> with
Greg). Which brings us to today. Phew!
</p>
<h2>
What’s the story behind your blog?
</h2>
<p>
I’ve always loved writing. Some days, I harbor secret aspirations to be
a real writer. (Uh-oh, secret’s out…) So blogging just comes naturally.
I don’t think of my blog as part of a business, or as a way to promote
myself exactly. It’s more of a place that gives me an outlet to organize
my thoughts publicly.
</p>
<p>
I generally find myself writing about a combination of daily life,
music, my own creative process, and things I’m doing or making. I
haven’t used social media much (although I’ve been enjoying
<a href="https://io.waxandleather.com/@alisynthesis">Mastodon</a> for
the last year or two!), so I sometimes use my blog as my own personal
Insta-book feed. It’s fun to make a quick post of something I like
and/or find amusing, and I enjoy perusing my old posts occasionally. My
memory isn’t the greatest, so in the case of daily life posts, I often
wouldn’t remember the thing at all if I didn’t blog about it!
</p>
<p>
Because blogging is purely for my own fun and enjoyment, I don’t force
myself to keep any kind of posting schedule. I just post when I feel
like it. I go through phases where that’s weekly, monthly, or even less.
So if you’re looking for a consistent presence in your RSS feed, my blog
is probably not for you.
</p>
<p>
I don’t have any blog posts from prior to my current website, although I
did have other blogs on Tumblr and early Squarespace over the years. It
looks like I started blogging on my own site in about 2014. See, told
you my memory was bad…I had to sign in to find out when my earliest
posts were!
</p>
<h2>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?
</h2>
<p>
My blogging process probably doesn’t qualify as a process. More like, “I
just blog when I feel like it and say whatever I want to.” That said, I
do also write quite a bit privately, so maybe it would be interesting to
explore the difference between my public and private writing?
</p>
<p>
I’m generally an open book – the kind of person who will tell strangers
whatever they want to know about me. That said, I do write differently
on my blog than in my personal journals. Obviously, I edit a lot more on
the blog. I also tend to post the kinds of things that I think others
might find interesting, which means I don’t often post about my own
internal thoughts and feelings.
</p>
<p>
That said, I enjoy reading blogs where people get personal, so now I’m
wondering why I don’t do that! Perhaps a topic for a future blog post?
</p>
<p>
And to the second question: the above paragraphs illustrate how I get my
inspiration – navel gazing and over-thinking. ;)
</p>
<p>
For quick posts, I write directly in WordPress. For longer bits or
things that come out of my private journaling, I write in Markdown in
Obsidian. (Yes, I’m one of those obsessive Obsidian people.)
</p>
<h2>
Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the
physical space influences your creativity?
</h2>
<p>
I’m a very aesthetically-minded person who is most satisfied when I feel
like I’m immersed in beautiful and creative objects. I’ve tried to craft
my home environment so that I feel inspired in every seat in the house.
Right now, I’m sitting on my back porch looking my gardens and typing on
my laptop. It’s May in New Hampshire, and you can almost hear the plants
growing.
</p>
<p>
I tend to write short bits on my laptop wherever I want to be sitting,
because my office/studio is a place I work seriously. That said, my
studio is beautiful, ergonomic, and has a powerful computer, so anything
that takes awhile or requires lots of research/editing/photo work, I’ll
tend to do there.
</p>
<p>
I don’t typically listen to music while I work, because my brain won’t
agree to keep it in the background. And if music can be in the
background, I probably don’t want to hear it at all. (Not a judgment
about wallpaper music, that’s just how it is for me.) So there’s lots of
silence at my house.
</p>
<h2>
A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech
stack?
</h2>
<p>
Greg and I operate our own managed WordPress hosting platform (Digital
Ocean + Serverpilot) for our clients, so we also host all of our own
personal websites there. How convenient!
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I think about switching to a static site generator, and have
certainly enjoyed playing around with them and occasionally using them
for client projects, but since I know so much about WordPress, it’s
kinda my default.
</p>
<p>
We register all our domains at Namecheap, which has been rock solid over
the years.
</p>
<h2>
Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do
anything differently?
</h2>
<p>
I don’t think so. If I weren’t a WordPress person for work, I would
probably use a static site generator and really enjoy that experience. I
could easily see using an Obsidian vault at my CMS, and in face, I
maintain a public-not-public recipe site where I do exactly that, using
Obsidian to write, and Jekyll to website.
</p>
<h2>
Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does
it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some
revenue? And what’s your position on people monetising personal blogs?
</h2>
<p>
That’s a tough question since we run our own Digital Ocean servers. If I
were a client of ours, I would pay $486/year for our managed hosting
plan. But since I’m not, I don’t.
</p>
<p>
My blog generates absolutely no revenue. I haven’t tried, and I doubt I
will, because I prefer keeping my creative life separate from my
financial life. (Now that’s a blog post topic! I’m surprised I haven’t
written about that before. Who knows, maybe I have.)
</p>
<p>
That said, I don’t see anything wrong with other people monetizing their
blog. More power to ’em! I don’t regularly financially support any
bloggers, although I do tend to throw folks the occasional bone when I
enjoy their work for awhile.
</p>
<h2>
Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out?
And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?
</h2>
<p>
Here’s a
<a href="https://drive.proton.me/urls/4QTNCKWFYW#fX4XAW0GJI4Z">link to
all the personal blogs I subscribe to</a> in my RSS reader:
</p>
<p>
A few quick blog recs:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Gotta plug <a href="https://gregwilder.com">Greg Wilder’s blog</a>,
which is an awesome and regularly-updated account of being a
composer/pianist/synthesizer wizard/mountain man.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://ruk.ca/">Peter Rukavina</a> is a writer, printer and
developer on Prince Edward Island. I don’t know him, but I so enjoy his
description of his life on his blog. He seems like a wonderful person!
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://rubenerd.com/">Ruben Schade</a> is an prolific
blogger/developer who I also don’t know, but whose writing style and
perspective I totally enjoy.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?
</h2>
<p>
I’ve been obsessed with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Strickland_(director)">Peter
Strickland</a>’s films over the last few years. Berberian Sound Studio
and its soundtrack (by the super-cool band Broadcast) are AMAZING. Check
them out if your taste tends toward the weird and wild.
</p>
<p>
More in weird electronic music: don’t sleep on Mort Garson. He may be
dead, but <a href="https://mortgarson.bandcamp.com/">he’s still on
Bandcamp</a>!
</p>

A compiler cannot catch all semantic errors. An infinite recursion is
often not caught by a compiler. Again, I argue for (in)completeness
reasons: it would, probably, be not that difficult to catch cases like
this one
</p>
<div class="gl-relative markdown-code-block js-markdown-code">
<pre data-sourcepos="2:1-7:3" class="code highlight js-syntax-highlight language-plaintext" v-pre="true"><code><span id="LC1" class="line" lang="plaintext">PROCEDURE P();</span>

<span id="LC3" class="line" lang="plaintext">  P()</span>
<span id="LC4" class="line" lang="plaintext">END P;</span></code></pre>
<p><copy-code></copy-code></p>
</div>
<p data-sourcepos="8:1-8:153" dir="auto">
but it already becomes more difficult when the error is not that obvious
any more like in the following wrong attempt to implement the factorial
function
</p>
<div class="gl-relative markdown-code-block js-markdown-code">
<pre data-sourcepos="9:1-16:3" class="code highlight js-syntax-highlight language-plaintext" v-pre="true"><code><span id="LC1" class="line" lang="plaintext">PROCEDURE F(i: INTEGER): INTEGER;</span>

So, for the time being, I don't know how to handle this. The compiler
would need to do much more sophisticated things than it is currently
doing in order to detect a lot of infinite recursion cases (and it would
never be guaranteed to catch all cases).

The example I made was pretty artificial and I don't think it is a good
idea to mark errors (only) for very special situations. If at all, we
might issue a warning when a local variable is returned by reference
because this is a case that can easily happen. But, to be honest, I am
not that happy with this kind of incomplete solution either. The concept
of return by reference is inherently dangerous and we will have to live
with it or get rid of the concept altogether. I prefer the former
because I cannot stand having getters and setters all over the place
when an assignment operator shall be overloaded – here I prefer the C++
way over the Java way. (Niklaus Wirth would not have admitted a return
by reference in the first place).

Had His Climate Moment and He Used It to Talk About Paris</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUxNjIwNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNjkzNzAyMX0.oi8XXMuP0hbK5GwPW6T6Fh_2Yc5pVHaj_DhlrY18ADs/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
In an altogether distressing debate in which climate was far from a main
focus, the two candidates did have one notable exchange regarding the
Paris Agreement. The 2015 treaty united most countries around the world
in setting a goal to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees
Celsius, with 1.5 degrees as the ultimate target.
</p>
<p>
After Trump initially dodged a question about whether he would take
action to slow the climate crisis, he then briefly noted “I want
absolutely immaculate clean water and I want absolutely clean air. And
we had it. We had H2O.”
</p>
<p>
While it is true that there was H2O during Trump’s presidency, Biden
responded by criticizing Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris
Agreement. “I immediately [re]joined, because if we reach 1.5 degrees
Celsius, at any one point, there’s no way back,” Biden said. “The only
existential threat to humanity is climate change. And he didn’t do a
damn thing about it.”
</p>
<p>
But according to a poll conducted last November by Heatmap, only 35% of
Americans say they are at least “somewhat familiar” with the Paris
Agreement at all, perhaps making it an odd choice to anchor the debate’s
one exchange around climate. By contrast, the Inflation Reduction Act,
Biden’s signature piece of climate legislation, didn’t come up once.
(Not that they’re
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/inflation-reduction-act-popularity-repeal" target="_self"><u>that
familiar with the IRA</u></a>, either.) Solar, wind, carbon emissions —
all terms that resonate with Americans, none of which were mentioned.
</p>
<p>
Of his decisions to leave the Paris Agreement in 2017, Trump claimed,
“The Paris Accord was going to cost us $1 trillion,” while it would cost
China, Russia, and India “nothing.”
</p>
<p>
The $1 trillion number actually appears to be a discount on Trump’s
previously cited estimate.
<a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-trump-paris-climate-accord/" target="_blank"><u>In
his Rose Garden address</u></a> announcing his decision to exit the
agreement, he said that by 2040, compliance would entail a cost to the
economy that would approach “$3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million
industrial jobs,” citing
<a href="https://www.globalenergyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/NERA%20Final%20Report%202.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
study </u></a>conducted by NERA Economic Consulting.
</p>
<p>
According to the fact-checking website
<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jan/21/wayne-christian/attacking-paris-accord-texas-oil-regulator-selecti/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>PolitiFact</u></a>,
the study’s authors were explicit that these projections are highly
uncertain and do not take into account all the job gains and GDP growth
that could be associated with the energy transition. PolitiFact also
said NERA put forth a news release (which now appears to be unavailable
online) stating that “the Trump administration selectively used results”
from its study, and that “NERA’s study was not a cost-benefit analysis
of the Paris Agreement, nor does it purport to be one.”
</p>
<p>
When Trump said that China, Russia, and India would not have financial
commitments under the Paris Agreement, he was perhaps referencing the
obligation (which the Paris Agreement reaffirmed) for wealthier nations
like the U.S. to direct hundreds of billions of dollars to poorer
nations to both aid their transition to clean energy and help them adapt
to the impacts of climate change.
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-67610621" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>It’s
true that there’s controversy</u></a> around whether China or India,
which have giant (but still developing) economies, should either provide
this funding or receive this funding. Russia, which joined the agreement
in 2019, hasn’t really been a part of this conversation though.
</p>
<p>
In response to Trump’s defense of his decision to exit the agreement,
Biden countered, “We were the only ones of consequence who were not
members of the Paris Accord. How can we do anything if the United States
can’t get its pollution under control?” He said the U.S. had made
significant progress on climate, and while it felt like a moment to, I
don’t know, note the job growth from the administration’s investment in
cleantech manufacturing (in predominantly
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/renewable-energy-texas-senate-voting" target="_self"><u>red
states</u></a>), Biden instead cited
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-american-climate-corps" target="_self"><u>the
formation of the Climate Corps</u></a>, a nice but thus-far modest
fellowship program that puts young Americans to work fighting the
climate crisis. Most of the public likely hasn’t heard of it, and Biden
has been mostly quiet about it of late.
</p>
<p>
The exchange ended when Biden said, “We’re moving in directions that are
going to significantly change the elemental cause of pollution. But the
idea that [Trump] claims that he has the biggest heart up here and is
really concerned about pollution, and about climate, I’ve not seen any
indication of that.”
</p>
<p>
And just like that, it was onto prescription drugs, who is better at
golf, and Trump’s weight. You know, the usual debate stuff.

<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p>
Former President Donald Trump has been known, on occasion,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/24/trumps-false-or-misleading-claims-total-30573-over-four-years/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>to
exaggerate</u></a>. Still, an assertion he made during the first
presidential debate on Thursday night is one for the books: “During my
four years, I had the best environmental numbers ever,” he said.
</p>
<p>
It was “unclear” what Trump was “talking about,” <em><em>The New York
Times</em></em>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/06/27/us/biden-trump-debate/1fe60bcd-b3f2-52f8-a321-4b343de2fca6?smid=url-share" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>diplomatically
said</u></a>. But Thursday was hardly the first time
<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/09/donald-trump-environment-roosevelt#:~:text=Trump%20compared%20himself%20to%20conservationist,%E2%80%9CI%20am%2C%20I%20am." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Trump
has claimed</u></a> to be “the number one” environmentalist president.
He’s said that the “environment is very important to me” and that “I’m a
big believer in that word: the environment.” And for proof,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/01/09/this-is-perhaps-trumps-most-cynical-comment-about-environment-yet/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he’s
historically pointed to</u></a> a book written by a longtime Trump
Organization staffer that called him “An Environmental Hero” as well as
the fact that “I did the best environmental impact statements.”
</p>
<p>
Trump’s actions tell a different story. Despite insisting on Thursday
that he wants “absolutely immaculate clean water and … absolutely clean
air,” Trump’s Project 2025 roadmap for a second term
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>describes</u></a>
targeting California’s Clean Air Act waiver, reducing fuel economy
requirements, and making it harder to keep big polluters in check.
Trump’s presidential record also speaks for itself: During his four
years in office, he
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/climate-environment/trump-climate-environment-protections/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rolled
back</u></a> 100 environmental rules or more, including
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/climate/trump-environment-water.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>removing</u></a>
pollution controls on streams and wetlands and
<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/trump-coal-plan-will-kill-1400-americans-a-year" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gutting</u></a>
Obama-era emission standards. According to
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/trump-s-environment-policies-killed-thousands-scientists-say" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one
estimate</u></a> in the esteemed British medical journal <em><em>The
Lancet</em></em>, Trump’s environmental policies resulted in 22,000
deaths in 2019 alone. He’s been described as
<a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/trump-worst-president-environment-2645034831.html?rebelltitem=4#rebelltitem4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
worst president</u></a> for the environment in U.S. history.
</p>
<p>
President Biden put it even more succinctly in his rebuttal: Trump has
“not done a damn thing for the environment.”

former police officials indicted over Uvalde shooting response, reports
say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>AUSTIN, Texas — The former Uvalde schools police chief and another
former officer have been indicted over their role in the slow police
response to the 2022 massacre at a Texas elementary school that left 19
children and two teachers dead, according to multiple reports
Thursday.</p>
<p>The Uvalde Leader-News and the San Antonio Express-News reported
former schools police Chief Pete Arredondo and former officer Adrian
Gonzales were indicted by a grand jury on multiple counts of felony
child endangerment and abandonment. The Uvalde Leader-News reported that
District Attorney Christina Mitchell confirmed the indictment. </p>
<p>The Austin American-Statesman also reported two former officers had
been indicted but did not identify them.</p>
<p>Mitchell did not immediately return messages from The Associated
Press seeking comment. Several family members of victims of the shooting
did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.</p>
<p>The indictments would make Arredondo, who was the on-site commander
during the attack, and Gonzales the first officers to face criminal
charges in one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history. A
scathing report by Texas lawmakers that examined the police response
described Gonzales as one of the first officers to enter the building
after the shooting began.</p>
<p>The indictments were kept under seal until the men were in custody,
and both were expected to turn themselves in by Friday, the news outlets
reported. The indictments come more than two years after an 18-year-old
gunman opened fire in a fourth-grade classroom, where he remained for
more than 70 minutes before officers confronted and killed him. In
total, 376 law enforcement officers massed at Robb Elementary School on
May 24, 2022, some waiting in the hallway outside the classroom, even as
the gunman could be heard firing an AR-15-style rifle inside.</p>
<p>The office of a former attorney for Arredondo said they did not know
whether the former chief has new representation. The AP could not
immediately find a phone number to reach Gonzales.</p>
<p>Arredondo lost his job three months after the shooting. Several
officers involved were eventually fired, and separate investigations by
the Department of Justice and state lawmakers faulted law enforcement
with botching their response to the massacre.</p>
<p>Whether any officers would face criminal charges over their actions
in Uvalde has been a question hanging over the city of 15,000 since the
Texas Rangers completed their investigation and turned their findings
over to prosecutors.</p>
<p>Mitchell’s office has also come under scrutiny. Uvalde city officials
filed a lawsuit last year that accused prosecutors of not being
transparent and withholding records related to the shooting. Media
outlets, including the AP, have sued Uvalde officials for withholding
records requested under public information laws.</p>
<p>But body camera footage, investigations by journalists and damning
government reports have laid bare how over the course of over an hour, a
mass of officers went in and out of the school with weapons drawn but
did not go inside the classroom where the shooting was taking place. The
hundreds of officers at the scene included state police, Uvalde police,
school officers and U.S. Border Patrol agents.</p>
<p>In their July 2022 report, Texas lawmakers faulted law enforcement at
every level with failing “to prioritize saving innocent lives over their
own safety.” The Justice Department released its own report in January
that detailed “cascading failures” by police in waiting far too long to
confront the gunman, acting with “no urgency” in establishing a command
post and communicating inaccurate information to grieving families.</p>
<p>Uvalde remains divided between residents who say they want to move
past the tragedy and others who still want answers and accountability.
During the first mayoral race since the shooting, locals voted in a man
who had served as mayor more than a decade ago over a mother who led
calls for tougher gun laws after her daughter was killed in the
attack.</p>
<p>Robb Elementary School is now permanently closed. The city broke
ground on a new school in October 2023.</p>

US needs to tackle debt despite robust growth</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The International Monetary Fund on Thursday called on
the U.S. to raise taxes to curb rising debt levels while applauding
“robust, dynamic” growth in the world’s largest economy and progress
toward bringing inflation under control.</p>
<p>The IMF said in a closing statement for its “Article IV” review of
U.S. economic policies that high deficits and debt “create a growing
risk to the U.S. and global economy, potentially feeding into higher
fiscal financing costs and a growing risk to the smooth rollover of
maturing obligations.”</p>
<p>The IMF’s statement slightly revised down its 2024 U.S. GDP growth
forecast to 2.6% from the 2.7% forecast in the global lender’s World
Economic Outlook in April.</p>
<p>The IMF forecasts U.S. growth in 2025 to dip to 1.9%, unchanged from
the April outlook, and remaining above 2% through the end of the
decade.</p>
<p>“The U.S. economy has proven itself to be robust, dynamic and
adaptable to changing global conditions,” the IMF said. “Activity and
employment continue to expectations … and the disinflation process has
been considerably less costly than many had feared.”</p>
<p>The IMF said it expects U.S. inflation to return to the Federal
Reserve’s 2% target by mid-2025, considerably sooner than the Fed’s own
forecast of returning to target in 2026.</p>
<p>IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva told reporters that the
IMF’s forecast is more optimistic because of the current trajectory of
inflation indicates a quicker return to target, partly because strong
U.S. consumer spending driven by wealth built up during the COVID-19
pandemic is subsiding and the labor market is cooling.</p>
<p>Debt, trade prescriptions</p>
<p>But the IMF chided Washington for rising deficits that, if continued,
would bring the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio to a concerning level of 140% by
the end of the decade. The IMF measure includes Social Security pension
and Medicare health care obligations.</p>
<p>“Such high deficits and debt create a growing risk to the U.S. and
global economy, potentially feeding into higher fiscal financing costs
and a growing risk to the smooth rollover of maturing obligations,” the
Fund said.</p>
<p>For the second year in a row, the fund prescribed that the U.S.
increase income tax rates progressively, not only on the wealthiest
Americans but also for households earning less than $400,000 a year — a
threshold that U.S. President Joe Biden has vowed not to cross in his
re-election campaign pledges.</p>
<p>The fund said the U.S. also should reform entitlement programs, cuts
that Biden and Republican rival Donald Trump have both vowed not to
pursue, and raise the threshold for eligibility for the Earned Income
Tax Credit for workers without children.</p>
<p>Georgieva said the fund was trying to present a policy path for the
U.S. “that in our view would serve the economy and its people well,” as
it would for any IMF member country.</p>
<p>With the U.S. economy strong, it was a “good time” for the U.S. to
consolidate its fiscal position, she said, adding: “It is in good times
where you can do more to prepare yourself for risks in the future.”</p>
<p>The IMF also said that intensifying U.S. tariffs and other trade
barriers along with the increased use of industrial policy to favor
domestic firms represented a downside risk for the U.S. and global
economies, with the potential to distort investment flows and undermine
the global trading system.</p>
<p>Instead, the fund called for Washington to work out differences with
trading partners through negotiations and strengthen the World Trade
Organization.</p>
<p>In her discussion with Georgieva, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet
Yellen reiterated the importance of “frank and thorough assessments” of
IMF member economies and discussed the “remarkable performance of the
U.S. economy over the past few years,” the Treasury said.</p>
