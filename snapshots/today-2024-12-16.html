<p>Like just about everyone, we were impressed by the ability of
NotebookLM to generate podcasts: Two virtual people holding a
discussion. You can give it some links, and it will generate a podcast
based on the links. The podcasts were interesting and engaging. But they
also had some limitations. The problem with NotebookLM is that, […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: Glasgow Haskell Compiler</p>
<h1>
GHC 9.12.1 is now available
</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">
Zubin Duggal - 2024-12-16
</h4>
<p>
The GHC developers are very pleased to announce the release of GHC
9.12.1. Binary distributions, source distributions, and documentation
are available at
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.1">downloads.haskell.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
We hope to have this release available via ghcup shortly.
</p>
<p>
GHC 9.12 will bring a number of new features and improvements,
including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The new language extension
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0522-or-patterns.rst">OrPatterns</a>
allowing you to combine multiple pattern clauses into one.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0569-multiline-strings.rst">MultilineStrings</a>
language extension to allow you to more easily write strings spanning
multiple lines in your source code.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Improvements to the OverloadedRecordDot extension, allowing the built-in
<code>HasField</code> class to be used for records with fields of non
lifted representations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0409-exportable-named-default.rst">NamedDefaults</a>
language extension has been introduced allowing you to define defaults
for typeclasses other than <code>Num</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
More deterministic object code output, controlled by the
<code>-fobject-determinism</code> flag, which improves determinism of
builds a lot (though does not fully do so) at the cost of some compiler
performance (1-2%). See
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/12935">#12935</a> for
the details
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
GHC now accepts type syntax in expressions as part of
<a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0281-visible-forall.rst">GHC
Proposal <span>#281</span></a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The WASM backend now has support for TemplateHaskell.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Experimental support for the RISC-V platform with the native code
generator.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
… and many more
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A full accounting of changes can be found in the
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.1/docs/users_guide/9.12.1-notes.html">release
notes</a>. As always, GHC’s release status, including planned future
releases, can be found on the GHC Wiki
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/GHC-status">status</a>.
</p>
<p>
We would like to thank GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake pool, Well-Typed,
Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, the Haskell Foundation, and
other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial and in-kind
support has facilitated GHC maintenance and release management over the
years. Finally, this release would not have been possible without the
hundreds of open-source contributors whose work comprise this release.
</p>
<p>
As always, do give this release a try and open a
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if
you see anything amiss.

Apple is working on a foldable device the size of two iPad Pros</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-15, from: Liliputing</p>
<p>
I’ve been writing about small computers since the original Asus Eee PC
launched in the United States in 2007, showing that it was possible to
make computers that were both ultraportable and affordable. But over the
years I’ve also come to find that while there’s certainly a place for
small-screen devices like netbooks, tablets, and smartphones, […]

<h2 id="what-i-say-when-someone-asks-me-what-are-my-favorite-docs">What
I say when someone asks me what are my favorite docs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-15, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti</p>
<p>
I’m a terrible user of documentation. I tend to consume docs in a hurry,
reading diagonally, Control+Fing my way to things. I generally mistreat
the interface of docs until I obtain something resembling an answer. I
do this because I’ve little time and I need to fix issues fast. I love
examples I can copy and paste. I’ve little patience for verbose
documentation and even less for docs that look like they were written
without care or skill. I’m not only bothered by inaccuracy, but also by
bad style. In a way, as a user of documentation, I’m the worst nightmare
of a technical writer.
