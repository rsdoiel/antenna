<h2 id="chromiums-influence-on-chromium-alternatives">Chromium’s
influence on Chromium alternatives</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>I don’t think most people realize how Firefox and Safari depend on
Google for more than “just” revenue from default search engine deals and
prototyping new web platform features. Off the top of my head, Safari
and Firefox use the following Chromium libraries: libwebrtc, libbrotli,
libvpx, libwebp, some color management libraries, libjxl (Chromium may
eventually contribute a Rust JPEG-XL implementation to Firefox; it’s a
hard image format to implement!), much of Safari’s cryptography (from
BoringSSL), Firefox’s 2D renderer (Skia)…the list goes on. Much of
Firefox’s security overhaul in recent years (process isolation, site
isolation, user namespace sandboxes, effort on building with
ControlFlowIntegrity) is directly inspired by Chromium’s architecture. ↫
Rohan “Seirdy” Kumar Definitely an interesting angle on the browser
debate I hadn’t really stopped to think about before. The argument is
that while Chromium’s dominance is not exactly great, the other side of
the coin is that non-Chromium browsers also make use of a lot of
Chromium code all of us benefit from, and without Google doing that
work, Mozilla would have to do it by themselves, and let’s face it, it’s
not like they’re in a great position to do so. I’m not saying I buy the
argument, but it’s an argument nonetheless. I honestly wouldn’t mind a
slower development pace for the web, since I feel a lot of energy and
development goes into things making the web worse, not better.
Redirecting some of that development into things users of the web would
benefit from seems like a win to me, and with the dominant web engine
Chromium being run by an advertising company, we all know where their
focus lies, and it ain’t on us as users. I’m still firmly on the side of
less Chromium, please.</p>

<h2 id="googles-ad-blocking-crackdown-underway">Google’s ad-blocking
crackdown underway</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>Google has gotten a bad reputation as of late for being a bit
overzealous when it comes to fighting ad blockers. Most recently, it’s
been spotted automatically turning off popular ad blocking extension
uBlock Origin for some Google Chrome users. To a degree, that makes
sense—Google makes its money off ads. But with malicious ads and data
trackers all over the internet these days, users have legitimate reasons
to want to block them. The uBlock Origin controversy is just one facet
of a debate that goes back years, and it’s not isolated: your favorite
ad blocker will likely be affected next. Here are the best ways to keep
blocking ads now that Google is cracking down on ad blockers. ↫ Michelle
Ehrhardt at LifeHacker Here’s the cold and harsh reality: ad blocking
will become ever more difficult as time goes on. Not only is Google
obviously fighting it, other browser makers will most likely follow
suit. Microsoft is an advertising company, so Edge will follow suit in
dropping Manifest v2 support. Apple is an advertising company, and will
do whatever they can to make at least their own ads appear. Mozilla is
an advertising company, too, now, and will continue to erode their
users’ trust in favour of nebulous nonsense like privacy-respecting
advertising in cooperation with Facebook. The best way to block ads is
to move to blocking at the network level. Get a cheap computer or
Raspberry Pi, set up Pi-Hole, and enjoy some of the best adblocking
you’re ever going to get. It’s definitely more involved than just
installing a browser extension, but it also happens to be much harder
for advertising companies to combat. If you’re feeling generous, set up
Pi-Holes for your parents, friends, and relatives. It’s worth it to make
their browsing experience faster, safer, and more pleasant. And once
again I’d like to reiterate that I have zero issues with anyone blocking
the ads on OSNews. Your computer, your rules. It’s not like display ads
are particularly profitable anyway, so I’d much rather you support us
through Patreon or a one-time donation through Ko-Fi, which is a more
direct way of ensuring OSNews continues to exist. Also note that the
OSNews Matrix room – think IRC, but more modern, and fully end-to-end
encrypted – is now up and running and accessible to all OSNews Patreons
as well.</p>

id="qualcomm-cancels-its-mini-pc-with-the-snapdragon-x-elite-processor">Qualcomm
cancels its mini PC with the Snapdragon X Elite processor</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>Something odd happened to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Dev Kit, an $899 mini
PC powered by Windows 11 and the company’s latest Snapdragon X Elite
processor. Qualcomm decided to abruptly discontinue the product, refund
all orders (including for those with units on hand), and cease its
support, claiming the device “has not met our usual standards of
excellence.” ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin The launch of the Snapdragon X Pro
and Elite chips seems to have mostly progressed well, but there have
been a few hiccups for those of us who want ARM but aren’t interested in
Windows and/or laptops. There’s this story, which is just odd all
around, with an announced, sold, and even shipped product suddenly taken
off the market, which I think at this point was the only non-laptop
device with an X Elite or Pro chip. If you are interested in developing
for Qualcomm’s new platform, but don’t want a laptop, you’re out of luck
for now. Another note is that the SoC SKU in the Dev Kit was clocked a
tiny bit higher than the laptop SKUs, which perhaps plays a role in its
cancellation. The bigger hiccup is the problematic Linux bring-up, which
is posing many more problems and is taking a lot longer than Qualcomm
very publicly promised it would take. For now, if you want to run Linux
on a Snapdragon X Elite or Pro device, you’re going to need a custom
version of your distribution of choice, tailored to a specific laptop
model, using a custom kernel. It’s an absolute mess and basically means
that at this point in time, months and months after release, buying one
of these to run Linux on them is a bad idea. Quite a few important bits
will arrive with Linux 6.12 to supposedly greatly improve the
experience, but seeing is believing. Qualcomm made a lot of grandiose
promises about Linux support, and they simply haven’t delivered.</p>

<h2 id="go-plan9-memo-speeding-up-calculations-450">Go Plan9 memo,
speeding up calculations 450%</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>I want to take advantage of Go’s concurrency and parallelism for some
of my upcoming projects, allowing for some serious number crunching
capabilities. But what if I wanted EVEN MORE POWER?!? Enter
SIMD, Same Instruction Muliple Data . Simd instructions allow for
parallel number crunching capabilities right down at the hardware level.
Many programming languages either have compiler optimizations that use
simd or libraries that offer simd support. However, (as far as I can
tell) Go’s compiler does not utilizes simd, and I cound not find a
general propose simd package that I liked. I just want a package that
offers a thin abstraction layer over arithmetic and bitwise simd
operations. So like any good programmer I decided to slightly reinvent
the wheel and write my very own simd package. How hard could it be?
After doing some preliminary research I discovered that Go uses its own
internal assembly language called Plan9. I consider it more of an
assembly format than its own language. Plan9 uses target platforms
instructions and registers with slight modifications to their names and
usage. This means that x86 Plan9 is different then say arm Plan9.
Overall, pretty weird stuff. I am not sure why the Go team went down
this route. Maybe it simplifies the compiler by having this bespoke
assembly format? ↫ Jacob Ray Pehringer Another case of light reading for
the weekend. Even as a non-programmer I learned some interesting things
from this one, and it created some appreciation for Go, even if I don’t
fully grasp things like this. On top of that, at least a few of you will
think this has to do with Plan9 the operating system, which I find a
mildly entertaining ruse to subject you to.</p>
