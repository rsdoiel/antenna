<p>date: 2024-07-05, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
The U.S. economy added 206,000 jobs in June, according to the labor
department. But job growth in previous months was revised down
significantly. What can we make of this data? And what does it mean for
next steps for the Federal Reserve? Workers also saw the slowest pace of
wage growth in two years. And later: views on France’s election from a
farmers market in the French city of Lille.

<p>date: 2024-07-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’ve been working on a bunch of small projects involving
microcontrollers. Currently a lot of them are based around the Raspberry
Pi Pico boards because I like the development experience of those a lot.
They have a decent SDK and cheap hardware to get started and the
debugger works with gdb/openocd so it just integrates in all IDEs that
support that. One of my current projects is making a fancy hardware
controller for a bunch of video equipment I use. The main things that
will be controlled are two PTZ cameras (those are cameras that have
motors to move them). One stationary camera and the video switching
equipment that that’s hooked up to. ↫ Martijn Braam There’s more to
building something like this than connecting up hardware components –
there’s also software that needs to be taken care of. In this case, the
author is weighing several real-time operating systems for use in the
project, namely FreeRTOS, NuttX, and Zephyr. If you’re working on a
similar project, this article may help in choosing the RTOS that’s right
for you.</p>

Germany passed reforms that will guarantee people living in apartments

harvest solar power is thus legally enshrined,” Carsten Körnig, the head

While the Labour Party saw a historic win in Thursday’s general election
in the U.K., the new prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, is without a raft
of money to implement sweeping reforms. So how will the new government
differ economically from the one seen under Conservative rule? And
later, it’s hard to prepare a meal with a newborn in your hands. That
inspired one couple to open a restaurant in Atlanta.

<p class="drop-caps">
Minneapolis may be the only city in the country with a carbon
sequestration program manager on staff. Now, Jim Doten — who holds that
title — is about to realize his dream of starting up one of the first
municipally owned and operated carbon removal projects.
</p>
<p>
The Minnesota metropolis has just purchased its very own biomass
pyrolyzer, a machine that heats up tree clippings in a low-oxygen
environment and turns them into a form of charcoal called
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/biochar-carbon-removal-microsoft" target="_self"><u>biochar</u></a>.
As the wood grew, it sucked carbon out of the air during photosynthesis;
as biochar, that carbon becomes stable for hundreds of years, if not
longer.
</p>
<p>
Biochar can be mixed into soil, and has a wide range of demonstrated
benefits, including increasing crop yields and enhancing the soil’s
capacity to hold water. Some studies suggest it can filter contaminants
out of stormwater. The city plans to use the biochar in public works
projects and donate it to community groups in “green zones,”
neighborhoods with high levels of pollution and marginalized
populations. It’s also in talks with other local governments that might
be interested in buying some.
</p>
<p>
“One of the things we want to do is be a regional resource for other
government agencies,” Doten told me, “whether it be city, county, state
agencies, making biochar available for projects addressing the effects
of climate change, sequestering carbon, as well as providing
environmental benefits throughout our infrastructure.”
</p>
<p>
Studies say that we should be shoveling billions of tons of CO2 out of
the skies each year by 2050 to keep climate change in check — and that’s
on top of cutting emissions to near-zero. Scholars have compared the
vast responsibility of cleaning up the carbon in the atmosphere to
municipal waste management: Since the task is more of a public good than
a profitable enterprise, it may be best suited for the folks we already
rely on to take out the trash.
</p>
<p>
A number of other municipalities have been experimenting with carbon
removal to support their climate goals. Notably, Boulder County,
Colorado teamed up with Flagstaff, Arizona, and a number of other
cities, to form the
<a href="https://grist.org/climate/why-boulder-and-flagstaff-are-pooling-resources-to-purchase-carbon-removal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Four
Corners Coalition</u></a>, which is pooling resources to finance local
carbon removal projects. But Minneapolis is the first, at least that I’m
aware of, to essentially start its own carbon removal department.
</p>
<p>
Doten became a biochar evangelist more than a decade ago. He first
learned of the substance’s various benefits while working in southern
Afghanistan with the Minnesota National Guard in 2012. He was serving as
a hydrologist on an agribusiness development team and helping village
farmers rebuild soil health to improve crop yields. When he returned to
Minneapolis the following year, he was eager to test out biochar’s
benefits at home.
</p>
<p>
Over the decade that followed, Doten worked days as the supervisor of
environmental services for the city’s health department. But on the
side, he led a number of biochar passion project. He convinced the
public works department to use biochar in landscaping projects along
street medians. He started a partnership with the Shakopee Mdewakanton
Sioux, a tribe that runs a compost facility, to provide a mix of compost
and biochar to urban gardens around the city. He got the health
department to sponsor a research trial at the community farm at
<a href="https://www.littleearth.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Little
Earth</u></a>, a federally-subsidized housing complex primarily occupied
by indigenous families. Though the study was disrupted by vandalism, the
city gathered enough data to show that the plots with biochar-amended
compost saw superior plant health, food production and water retention
during August drought conditions.
</p>
<p>
Doten told me the limiting factor for expanding these programs was the
availability of biochar. The city was buying it and shipping it in from
elsewhere, which Doten was also not happy about because the emissions
from shipping cuts into any climate benefits. Then, in 2019, he had the
opportunity to see what the city could do if finding biochar wasn’t an
issue. Bloomberg Philanthropies flew Doten and his colleagues to
Stockholm, Sweden, where five years earlier, the charity had helped the
city finance its own biochar production facility.
</p>
<p>
“So I went to Stockholm along with one of our city council members and
the head of public works, and ’I’ll be darned, oh my gosh, Jim, you
weren’t lying, this is a real program and it does really great things in
Stockholm!” Doten recalled. He waxed on about the “Stockholm method” for
planting urban trees that involves using biochar and which can help
manage the flow of stormwater. Stockholm is also sending waste heat from
its pyrolysis facility into a district heating system used to warm
apartments.
</p>
<p>
A few years later, Bloomberg Philanthropies invited other cities to
apply for funding to build similar programs. Minneapolis was
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/press/bloomberg-philanthropies-announces-mayors-challenge-winning-project-to-combat-climate-change-will-spread-to-seven-global-cities/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one
of three U.S. cities</u></a>, along with Lincoln, Nebraska, and
Cincinnati, Ohio, to win $400,000 in 2022 to develop city-wide biochar
projects. All three are expected to begin construction on their
production facilities this year; Doten hopes the Minneapolis facility
will be operational this fall.
</p>
<p>
The city has made an agreement with Xcel Energy, the local utility, to
collect the tree clippings from the company’s electrical line
maintenance work — previously that material was getting burned in a
power plant. Doten has also found a site for the facility — a somewhat
isolated industrial property near railroad tracks — which was no easy
feat in an urban environment. “It’s very difficult to site a place like
this within the city that’s not near residences, properly zoned, get the
neighborhood approvals, council approvals, and make sure everybody’s
happy — well I shouldn’t say happy, but at least satisfied with the
result.”
</p>
<p>
The other big piece was sourcing the equipment. As my colleague Katie
Brigham has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/biochar-carbon-removal-microsoft" target="_self"><u>reported</u></a>,
there are <em><em>a lot</em></em> of biochar companies. According to
<a href="https://alliedoffsets.com/cdr-data/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one
carbon removal database</u></a>, there are more than 240 such companies
around the world — more than any other type of carbon removal company.
But most of them have developed fancy pyrolysis machines for their own
use, to develop their own carbon removal projects. There aren’t that
many offering the technology for sale. Doten said he talked to most of
the ones that did, and there was one company whose bid came in far below
the rest — BluSky, a small startup based in Connecticut. Minneapolis
purchased the company’s equipment, nicknamed the “Vulcan” system, for
$585,000.
</p>
<p>
“We really believe in what Jim is doing and what the city is doing,”
Will Hessert, the company’s CEO, told me. “We want to see more cities
doing this.”
</p>
<p>
Writing in <em><em>The New Republic</em></em> in 2022, four scholars
made a case for a public model for carbon removal. They argued that if
the responsibility is left to private companies, it could end up like
plastic recycling, which is
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/31/822597631/plastic-wars-three-takeaways-from-the-fight-over-the-future-of-plastics" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>basically
a big lie</u></a> and “distracts from underlying causes while pollution
continues.” Or it could end up like privately owned electric utilities
who take shortcuts that end up costing lives, like how PG&amp;E’s
inadequate maintenance led to the 2018 Camp Fire in California.
</p>
<p>
“Imagine a regional, community-run carbon removal authority,” they
wrote, “that simultaneously pursues wetland restoration and forest
management, safely operates an industrial removal facility and
associated mining and geological sequestration operations, monitors
carbon levels in forests, and works with farmers to maintain healthy
fields that store carbon in the soil.”
</p>
<p>
That’s not what’s happening in Minneapolis. The climate benefits are
likely to be minimal. The city couldn’t provide me with an estimate, but
a
<a href="https://www.minneapolismn.gov/news/2023/november/biochar/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>story
about the project</u></a> from last year noted that the city anticipated
having a system that could handle 3,600 tons of wood waste per year,
resulting in an estimated 1,500 tons of CO2 removed. That’s about 0.04%
of the city’s current annual emissions.
</p>
<p>
There is a real opportunity for cities to play a role in carbon removal.
A
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44284-024-00069-x" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a>
from 2022 found that cities might be able to play a significant role in
carbon removal — potentially removing up to 1 billion tons per year,
though the numbers are “plagued by uncertainties” — by sequestering
carbon in vegetation, soils, and the built environment. In that sense,
Minneapolis’ biochar program could be one component of this larger
vision.

<h2>
Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?
</h2>
<p>
I’m originally from Ukraine, I grew up there and finished university.
Moved out in 2010 to explore the world. Since 2014 US was my home base.
</p>
<p>
I’m software engineer by trade. It was my education and first I worked
as a programmer because it was my career choice. But sometime around
2011 I fell in love with the web and programming. I worked at several
startups and few bigger tech companies and also created countless side
projects.
</p>
<h2>
What’s the story behind your blog?
</h2>
<p>
I created my personal site around 2013. It is 10+ years old. I think I
created it during the period when I was falling in love with programming
and ideas behind web and the Internet. I got exposed to them way later
in my life than people who grew up in Western Europe or US. I had a lot
of personal revelations at that time in my life.
</p>
<h2>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?
</h2>
<p>
Super simple. I discovered that writing feels “painful” for me. I really
do struggle. The only way that works for me is to remove editing part
and also write in the “stream of consciousness style”. I write stuff in
one go. I write some essay in Apple Notes and it gets published
automatically to my site while I’m writing it. I might reread it some
time later and edit few things - but usually I don’t do that and just
discover some typos years later.
</p>
<p>
Another important thing is that I mostly write on topics I don’t want to
think anymore. Writing is the final step of thinking over something for
me. I write down about some topic, publish it and then don’t think about
that again for a while.
</p>
<h2>
Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the
physical space influences your creativity?
</h2>
<p>
I wrote decent amount of essays on airplanes and trains. They are
uncomfortable physically, but I found them to be a great time to write
and to speed up the travel, Internet is flaky and I have space to
reflect. I also like to write(and program) in coffeeshops. I like noise
and I can usually fully block it out.
</p>
<h2>
A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech
stack?
</h2>
<p>
I’m software engineer. I always made custom stacks for my personal site.
For the past 2 years my website is powered by a small tool I made. It’s
a tool that publishes Apple Notes to my site. It’s called Montaigne.
</p>
<h2>
Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do
anything differently?
</h2>
<p>
I want to say: start even earlier. But that is also difficult because I
do feel that I didn’t have much to say before I was 25 yo and also I
didn’t discover my “voice”. But I think trying writing helps to discover
that voice.
</p>
<p>
Write as often as you can. If it’s 5 essays per year - it’s still good.
I collected many over the years and sometimes I open some and read and
get surprised with some insights I got. It’s a very interesting feeling.
</p>
<p>
I feel like even now I don’t capture most of the insights I have during
the year. So writing more is always a good advice.
</p>

I collected many of the year and sometimes I open some and read and

</p>
<p>
I feel like even now I don’t capture huge junk of the insights I have
during the year. So writing more is always a good advice.
</p>
<h2>
Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does
it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some
revenue? And what’s your position on people monetising personal blogs?
</h2>
<p>
I think people should do what they feel is good for them. If you are in
the position where you want/need to monetize - do that. If money is not
critical, do not do it. Eg write for yourself first. On top of that
there might be some second order unpredictable benefits to writing. Eg
someone would reach out to you and would offer a job or collaboration.
This is way better than money(if you don’t need them).
</p>
<p>
Hard to say how much does it cost to run my site since it runs using the
tool that I made. But for other people this tool is free:)
</p>

<h2 id="david-rosenthal-on-the-x-windowing-systems-40th-birthday">David
Rosenthal on the X Windowing System’s 40th birthday</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>David Rosenthal, one of the primary contributors to the X Windowing
System, has published an awesome blog post about the recent 40 year
anniversary of X, full of details about the early days of X development,
as well as the limitations they had to deal with, the choices they had
to make, and the environment in which they were constrained. Once at Sun
I realized that it was more important for the company that the Unix
world standardized on a single window system than that the standard be
Sun’s NeWS system. At C-MU I had already looked into X as an alternative
to the Andrew window system, so I knew it was the obvious alternative to
NeWS. Although most of my time was spent developing NeWS, I rapidly
ported X version 10 to the Sun/1, likely the second port to non-DEC
hardware. It worked, but I had to kludge several areas that depended on
DEC-specific hardware. The worst was the completely DEC-specific
keyboard support. Because it was clear that a major redesign of X was
needed to make it portable and in particular to make it work well on Sun
hardware, Gosling and I worked with the teams at DEC SRC and WRL on the
design of X version 11. Gosling provided significant input on the
imaging model, and I designed the keyboard support. As the
implementation evolved I maintained the Sun port and did a lot of
testing and bug fixing. All of which led to my trip to Boston to pull
all-nighters at MIT finalizing the release. ↫ David Rosenthal They were
clearly right. During those days, the UNIX world was using a variety of
windowing systems, all tied to various companies and platforms.
Standardising virtually the entire UNIX world on X aided in keeping UNIX
compatible-ish even in the then-new graphical era, and X’s enduring
existence to this very day is evidence of the fact they made a lot of
right choices early on. Rosenthal also explains why one of the main
alternatives to X, Sun’s PostScript-based NeWS, which was also
co-developed by Rosenthal, didn’t win out over X. It had several things
working against its adoptions and popularisation, such as Sun requiring
a license fee for the source code, its heftier system requirements, and
the fact it was more difficult to program for. After trying to create
what Rosenthal describes as a “ghastly kludge” by combining NeWS and X
into Xnews, Sun eventually killed it altogether. Of course, this
wouldn’t be restrospective of X without mentioning Wayland. We and Jobs
were wrong about the imaging model, for at least two reasons. First,
early on pixels were in short supply and applications needed to make the
best use of the few they were assigned. They didn’t want to delegate
control to the PostScript interpreter. Second, later on came GPUs with
3D imaging models. The idea of a one-size-fits-all model became
obsolete. The reason that Wayland should replace X11 is that it is
agnostic to the application’s choice of imaging model. ↫ David Rosenthal
This is about as close to a blessing from the original X Windowing
System developers you’re ever going to get, but Rosenthal does correctly
note that XWayland is a thing, and since not every application is going
to be rewritten to support Wayland, X will most likely be around for a
long time to come. In fact, he looks towards the future, and predicts
that we’ll definitely be celebrating 50 years of X, and that yes, people
will still be using it by then.</p>

id="silicon-valley-steps-up-screening-on-chinese-employees-to-counter-espionage">Silicon
Valley steps up screening on Chinese employees to counter espionage</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Leading U.S. technology companies reportedly have
increased security screening of employees and job applicants, which
experts say is necessary to counter the cyber espionage threat from
China.</p>
<p>While the enhanced screening is being applied to employees and
applicants of all races, those with family or other ties to China are
thought to be particularly vulnerable to pressure from the Beijing
government.</p>
<p>But at least one Chinese computer science graduate student at a U.S.
university is hoping to make his ties to China an asset. Zheng, who does
not want to reveal his first name for fear of retaliation from the
Chinese government, says he recently changed his focus to cybersecurity
in hopes of improving his job prospects in the United States.</p>
<p>“The goal is a bit high, but I think I know more about China as a
person born and raised in China. I hope to become a force with my own
characteristics in cybersecurity and a role in fighting against Chinese
cyber-attacks,” said Zheng, who is seeking political asylum in the
United States.</p>
<p>While Zheng said he is not very worried that increased security
checks will affect his job prospects, he said many international
students in his class worry that they will be shut out from
cybersecurity jobs.</p>
<p>Google, OpenAI and Sequoia Capital are among a number of technology
and venture capital firms that have stepped up security checks on
employees and potential recruits, according to a recent report by The
Financial Times.</p>
<p>The newspaper cited sources at those companies saying they were
responding to warnings from the U.S. government about a growing threat
from Chinese espionage over the past two years.</p>
<p>Chinese cyber espionage concerns</p>
<p>FBI Director Christopher Wray delivered one such message in a speech
in April, saying the Chinese government has tried to steal “intellectual
property, technology and research” from American industries.</p>
<p>In response, the U.S. government has stepped up security measures
over the last two years, including updating its export control
regulations to restrict China’s ability to obtain advanced computing
chips and artificial intelligence. The strengthened warnings to U.S.
companies are part of that response.</p>
<p>Ivan Kanapathy, senior vice president with Beacon Global Strategies,
told VOA that Silicon Valley executives share the U.S. government’s
concern. “In recent years, emerging technology companies have become
more wary; they don’t want to fall victim to China’s technology
absorption strategy,” he said.</p>
<p>“Companies can’t afford to help a competitor that will put them out
of business. We’ve seen that happen across many industries already. It’s
only natural for American and other allied cutting-edge companies to be
concerned and take steps to mitigate the risks of PRC state-sponsored
espionage,” he said.</p>
<p>Ray Wang, CEO of Silicon Valley-based Constellation Research Inc.,
said that the theft of American intellectual property has become more
rampant since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and that people with
ties to China were often targeted.</p>
<p>“During COVID, many folks with relatives in China were put in
compromising positions where they were asked to do things for the
Chinese government, or one’s relatives would be put at risk,” Wang said.
“China has infiltrated almost every aspect of the U.S., and the U.S. is
facing systemic problems.”</p>
<p>Kanapathy said China might also obtain American technology through
talent poaching, meaning they recruit someone with experience in a
particular technology and ask the person to take the technology to start
a new company in China. Although it is ethically questionable, it is
sometimes legal.</p>
<p>“China likely also tries to place its own people, including
engineers, into certain companies that have desirable technologies. It’s
a multipronged strategy,” he said.</p>
<p>In a statement to VOA, Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu
acknowledged the accusations but said the U.S. government “is short on
delivering solid evidence.”</p>
<p>“We firmly oppose to the groundless accusations and smears towards
China and hope the relevant parties can view China’s development
objectively and fairly,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Liu also pointed out that the World Intellectual Property
Organization last year named China as the world’s highest ranking
middle-income economy and 12th overall in terms of independently
creating intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>“China’s scientific and technological achievements are never made
through ‘stealing.’ The Chinese people, including our intellectuals,
made such achievements with our talent and hard work,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Security screening concerns</p>
<p>While the enhanced security reviews usually apply to all employees,
Wang said. Google and OpenAI have imposed stricter reviews for Chinese
employees, and Microsoft is transferring some of its most important
Chinese engineers from China to other regions of the world; NVIDIA has
also been highly vigilant in screening.</p>
<p>Microsoft employees in China, mostly involved with cloud computing,
were recently offered the opportunity to work in the United States,
Australia or Ireland, among other countries, state-run outlet said in a
report. The Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft asked as many as
800 employees, mostly engineers with Chinese nationality working on
cloud computing and AI, to consider relocating.</p>
<p>He said companies should exercise caution to avoid triggering
xenophobia.</p>
<p>“So almost every new worker, not just Chinese nationals, should
undergo the same vetting process. I think it’s really important. As
Asian Americans, we have to be very careful about those implications,”
he said.</p>
<p>So far, that has not been a problem for Joey Wu, a Chinese software
engineer in California. Wu told VOA he has not seen stringent measures
exercised against Chinese people, nor has he been treated differently
due to his Chinese citizenship.</p>
<p>“I think the U.S. is relatively tolerant and open,” Wu said. “It is
not easy for a large technology company to have so many foreign
employees. Chinese companies, such as Huawei, are full of Chinese faces,
with very few foreigners, and it is unlikely that Americans will be
hired to play a more important role.”</p>
<p>Kanapathy pointed out that the founders of many technology companies
are from China or India themselves, and these are the people who request
security checks on Chinese citizens.</p>
<p>VOA contacted Google, OpenAI and Sequoia Capital for comments but did
not receive a response by the time of publication.</p>
<p>VOA’s Adrianna Zhang contributed to this report.</p>

<h2 id="the-america-i-love">The America I love</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-04, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<div class="e-content entry-content">
<p style="font-style:normal;color:rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration:none;">
<img src="https://werd.io/file/668706664b941b68e20a81f2/thumb.jpg" alt="Hey, look, it’s an American flag" width="1024" height="683">
</p>
<p>
I’m a natural-born American citizen but never lived here until my early
thirties. I have a complicated relationship with the country: I never
thought I’d live here until I suddenly did. As it happened, my parents
moved back to look after my grandmother, and ten years later, I came
here to look after my mother. I was 21 when Bush became President,
having been the state governor who had executed the most people; I
marched against the Iraq War from Scotland. There was never a moment
where I thought, “America is a place I want to live.” But I wound up
here anywhere.
</p>
<p>
The America I had no intention of being a part of is still very much
here. It’s the America where people love guns and the right own
semi-automatic weapons is more important than the idea that we need to
stop children from being slaughtered in their schools. It’s the America
where the state murders prisoners by electrocuting them or injecting
them with poison or by gassing them, and where the police can gun down a
person of color and walk away. It’s the America that organizes coups in
other countries to further its own interests and nobody sees anything
wrong with it because it keeps gas prices down. It’s the America that
won’t take the bus because that’s what poor people do (and the word
“poor” is doing a lot of work here). It’s rugged individualism and
wealth-hoarding over community inclusion and equity. It’s racial
stereotypes and old-fashioned values. It’s flag-waving. It’s Bill
O’Reilly and Pat Buchanan and George W Bush and Donald Trump.
</p>
<p>
I’m sorry, but I can’t bring myself to love that America. It’s a bad
place to live. Objectively, even.
</p>
<p>
But that isn’t the only America. It turns out there are lots of them:
not just in the sense that each state is its own mini-nation, although
that’s true too, but also in terms of layers that spread from coast to
coast.
</p>
<p>
There’s an America I’m delighted to be a part of; one that I’ve come to
truly love. It’s the America that understands the impact it’s had and
has, both on its own communities and on the world, and genuinely wants
to do much better. It’s an America that is anti-drone, anti-war, and
against the military-industrial complex. It’s the America that wants to
spread equity and uplift communities instead of individuals. It’s the
one where nobody would ever think of banning a book or a news source,
where public libraries are for everyone, where it’s commonly understood
that education should be free and for all. It’s the one that loves art
and literature, that provides platforms for diverse lived experiences,
that believes in reparations. It loves people of all religions, and no
religion, equally, and knows that the separation of church and state is
a vital tenet for an inclusive democracy. It believes in democracy, come
to that, and science, and data and experimentation. It believes in the
common public good and in social contracts. It preserves nature and
protects vulnerable communities and makes sure nobody falls through the
cracks. It fights fascism of all kinds, from the loud politicians who
seeks to turn the country into a theocracy to the small voices who shun
difference in their local communities. It believes that immigration
makes the country great, and it invites people to join as is without
needing to assimilate or dissolve into a melting pot. It believes that
everyone should have the right to marry whoever they choose, have the
right to do what they will with their own bodies, and assert their
identities however they need to. It doesn’t care how much money you
make, where you come from, or what you believe: it asserts that you
deserve to live well. It is inclusive, and welcoming, and beautiful.
It’s Noam Chomsky and bell hooks and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Daniel
Ellsberg and Chelsea Manning. It takes the damn bus.
</p>
<p>
I assure you that it exists, and it’s everywhere. I’ve traveled across
this country many times now, and there are pockets of this America in
the places you’d least expect, alongside the places where you
<em>would</em> expect it. There are people trying to make a better
country, a more progressive and inclusive country, everywhere you go.
</p>
<p>
It’s not the only America, and it’s not the loudest America. But it’s
the best one, by far. I think it’s worth saying that I do love it; I
want to support it; I want it to be the defining experience of being in
and from this country. I don’t think that’s inevitable, but I think, if
we all work at it, that it as every chance of happening. I would love
that to be the case.

id="cloudflare-lets-customers-block-ai-bots-scrapers-and-crawlers-with-a-single-click">Cloudflare
lets customers block AI bots, scrapers and crawlers with a single
click</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>It seems the dislike for machine learning runs deep. In a blog post,
Cloudflare has announced that blocking machine learning scrapers is so
popular, they decided to just add a feature to the Cloudflare dashboard
that will block all machine learning scrapers with a single click. We
hear clearly that customers don’t want AI bots visiting their websites,
and especially those that do so dishonestly. To help, we’ve added a
brand new one-click to block all AI bots. It’s available for all
customers, including those on the free tier. To enable it, simply
navigate to the Security &gt; Bots section of the Cloudflare dashboard,
and click the toggle labeled AI Scrapers and Crawlers. ↫ Cloudflare blog
According to Cloudflare, 85% of their customers block machine learning
scrapers from taking content from their websites, and that number
definitely does not surprise me. People clearly understand that
multibillion dollar megacorporations freely scraping every piece of
content on the web for their own further obscene enrichment while giving
nothing back – in fact, while charging us for it – is inherently wrong,
and as such, they choose to block them from doing so. Of course, it
makes sense for Cloudflare to try and combat junk traffic, so this is
one of those cases where the corporate interests of Cloudflare actually
line up with the personal interests of its customers, so making blocking
machine learning scrapers as easy as possible benefits both parties. I
think OSNews, too, makes use of Cloudflare, so I’m definitely going to
ask OSNews’ owner to hit that button. Cloudflare further details that a
lot of people are blocking crawlers run by companies like Amazon,
Google, and OpenAI, but completely miss far more active crawlers like
those run by the Chinese company ByteDance, probably because those
companies don’t dominate the “AI” news cycle. Then there’s the massive
number of machine learning crawlers that just straight-up lie about
their intentions, trying to hide the fact they’re machine learning bots.
We fear that some AI companies intent on circumventing rules to access
content will persistently adapt to evade bot detection. We will continue
to keep watch and add more bot blocks to our AI Scrapers and Crawlers
rule and evolve our machine learning models to help keep the Internet a
place where content creators can thrive and keep full control over which
models their content is used to train or run inference on. ↫ Cloudflare
blog I find this particularly funny because what’s happening here is
machine learning models being used to block… Machine learning models.
Give it a few more years down the trajectory we’re currently on, and the
internet will just be bots reading content posted by other bots.</p>

<h2
id="parent-company-of-saks-fifth-avenue-to-buy-rival-neiman-marcus">Parent
company of Saks Fifth Avenue to buy rival Neiman Marcus</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — The parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue has signed a deal
to buy upscale rival Neiman Marcus Group, which owns Neiman Marcus and
Bergdorf Goodman stores, for $2.65 billion, with online behemoth Amazon
holding a minority stake.</p>
<p>The new entity would be called Saks Global, which will comprise the
Saks Fifth Avenue and Saks OFF 5TH brands, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf
Goodman, as well as the real estate assets of Neiman Marcus Group and
HBC, a holding company that purchased Saks in 2013.</p>
<p>HBC has secured $1.15 billion in financing from investment funds and
accounts managed by affiliates of Apollo, and a $2 billion fully
committed revolving asset-based loan facility from Bank of America,
which is the lead underwriter, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, RBC Capital
Markets and Wells Fargo.</p>
<p>The deal comes after months of rumors that the department store
chains had been negotiating a deal. But the twist is Amazon’s minority
stake, which adds “a bit of spice” to an otherwise anticipated pact,
according to Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, a research
firm.</p>
<p>The pact was announced Thursday after months of rumors that the
department store chains had been negotiating a deal.</p>
<p>“For years, many in the industry have anticipated this transaction
and the benefits it would drive for customers, partners and employees,”
said Richard Baker, HBC executive chairman and CEO in a statement. “This
is an exciting time in luxury retail, with technological advancements
creating new opportunities to redefine the customer experience, and we
look forward to unlocking significant value for our customers, brand
partners and employees.”</p>
<p>Saks and Neiman Marcus have struggled as shoppers have been pulling
back on buying high-end goods and shifting their spending toward
experiences such as travel and upscale restaurants. The two iconic
luxury purveyors have also faced stiffer competition from luxury brands,
which are increasingly opening their own stores. The deal should help
reduce operating costs and create more negotiating power with
vendors.</p>
<p>Saks Fifth Avenue currently operates 39 stores in the United States,
including its Manhattan flagship. In early 2021, Saks spun off its
website into a separate company, with the hopes of expanding that
business at a time when more people were shopping online.</p>
<p>Current Saks.com CEO Marc Metrick will become CEO of Saks Global,
leading Saks Global’s retail and consumer businesses and driving the
strategy to improve the luxury shopping experience.</p>
<p>Neiman Marcus filed for bankruptcy protection in May 2020 during the
first months of the coronavirus pandemic but emerged in September of
that year. Like many of its peers, the privately held department store
chain was forced to temporarily close its stores for several months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other department stores are under pressure to keep
increasing sales.</p>
<p>Lord &amp; Taylor announced in late August 2020 it was closing all
its stores after filing for bankruptcy earlier that month. It’s
operating online. Macy’s announced in February of this year that it will
close 150 unproductive namesake stores over the next three years,
including 50 by year’s end.</p>
<p>Consumers have proven resilient and willing to shop even after a bout
of inflation, although behaviors have shifted, with some Americans
trading down to lower-priced goods.</p>

<h2 id="some-sanity-for-c-and-c-development-on-windows">Some sanity for
C and C++ development on Windows</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>The article’s from 2021, but I think it’s still worth discussing. A
hard reality of C and C++ software development on Windows is that there
has never been a good, native C or C++ standard library implementation
for the platform. A standard library should abstract over the underlying
host facilities in order to ease portable software development. On
Windows, C and C++ is so poorly hooked up to operating system interfaces
that most portable or mostly-portable software — programs which work
perfectly elsewhere — are subtly broken on Windows, particularly outside
of the English-speaking world. The reasons are almost certainly
political, originally motivated by vendor lock-in, than technical, which
adds insult to injury. This article is about what’s wrong, how it’s
wrong, and some easy techniques to deal with it in portable software. ↫
Chris Wellons As someone who doesn’t know how to code or program,
articles like these are always difficult to properly parse. I understand
the primary problem the article covers, but what I’m curious about is
how much of this problem is personal – skill issue – and how much of it
is a widely held belief by Windows developers and programmers. I know
there’s quite a few of you in our audience, so I’d love to hear from you
how you feel about this. The author also authored his on fix, something
called libwinsane, which I’m also curious about – is this the only
solution, or are there more options out there?</p>

<p>
It took me a long time to get through the first third of this novel. The
protagonist is so vapid, her point of view so incurious and at the same
time so familiarly American, against a backdrop of obvious imperialism
and climate obliviousness, that it was hard to find the motivation to
continue.
</p>
<p>
But I’m glad I did. This is an indictment of one character, but through
her, all of America, and every country and every person that touches the
interconnected hyperobject of energy, climate, and western prosperity.
It’s savage, witty, and remarkably pointed: the kind of book that’s
soothing to read in the modern age because no, you’re not alone, someone
else is feeling this too, and their rage has manifested into something
far better articulated than you could hope to muster.
</p>
<p>
Is this shared awareness enough to halt the catastrophe that we’re
careening towards? Probably not. But holy shit, there’s something here,
and if there’s even a chance we can pull off the total culture change
that averting this crisis requires, we need to try.
</p>
<p>
The remaining two thirds sharpen to a point, an ending that will cut you
without mercy. And I’m grateful for it.

I’ve spent the week in Florence, Oregon, a lovely little town on the
coast. It’s a bit windy and a little cold, but as I’m fond of saying, I
lived in Scotland for a decade. I can take it.
</p>
<p>
Frank Herbert came to the town in
1957 <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2021/10/23/florence-oregon-movies-dune-frank-herbert-science-fiction-novels/">to
write about the dunes overtaking it</a>. The piece was never published,
but it gave him an idea
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7949/9780441172719">for a novel</a>.
</p>
<p>
In 1970, a whale washed ashore here, and the Oregon State Highway
Division decided to use dynamite to dislodge it.
<a href="https://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/florence_whale_explosion/">The
ensuing events were not quite as planned.</a> If you’ve never seen it,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD5sPgV61bw">the video is

Did you know that Dune and the exploding whale beach were the same
place? Well, now you do.

<p>
The national debt is tremendous and growing. And as lawmakers talk about
ways to address it, Social Security spending — which totals roughly $1.5
trillion a year — is often brought up as playing a big role. But by law,
Social Security cannot contribute to the national debt. Today, we’ll
parse exactly how the Social Security Administration invests money and
pays out. Then, heat insurance in India has helped thousands of female
workers.

id="thousands-evacuate-as-northern-california-wildfire-spreads-more-hot-weather-expected">Thousands
evacuate as Northern California wildfire spreads, more hot weather
expected</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>OROVILLE, Calif. — Firefighters lined roads to keep flames from
reaching homes as helicopters dropped water on a growing wildfire
Wednesday in Northern California that has forced at least 26,000 people
to evacuate, as the state sweltered under extreme heat.</p>
<p>The Thompson fire broke out before noon Tuesday about 110 kilometers
north of Sacramento, near the city of Oroville in Butte County. It sent
up a huge plume of smoke that could be seen from space as it grew to
more than 14 square kilometers. There was no containment.</p>
<p>But Oroville Mayor David Pittman said by Wednesday afternoon there
had been a “significant drop in the fire activity,” and he was hopeful
that some residents could soon be allowed to return home. The fire’s
progress was stopped along the southern edge and firefighters working in
steep terrain were trying to build containment lines on the northern
side.</p>
<p>“On that north side they have some real struggles in terms of the
topography,” Pittman said.</p>
<p>More than a dozen other blazes, most of them small, were active in
across the state, according to the California Department of Forestry and
Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. A new fire Wednesday afternoon prompted a
small number of evacuations in heavily populated Simi Valley, about 65
kilometers northwest of downtown Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The state’s largest blaze, the Basin Fire, covered nearly 57 square
kilometers of the Sierra National Forest in eastern Fresno County and
was 26% contained.</p>
<p>In Oroville, a state of emergency was declared Tuesday night and
evacuation centers were set up. The evacuation zone expanded Wednesday
into foothills and rural areas beyond the city that’s home to about
20,000 people. With July Fourth in mind, authorities also warned that
fireworks are banned in many places, including most of Butte County.</p>
<p>There was no immediate official report on property losses. An
Associated Press photographer saw fire burn three adjacent
suburban-style homes in Oroville.</p>
<p>The fire ignited sprigs of grass poking from the concrete edges of
Lake Oroville as gusty winds whipped up American flags lining a bend of
the state’s second largest reservoir and the nation’s tallest dam.</p>
<p>Residents stood on hillsides in the night, watching the orange glow,
as aircraft made water drops to keep the fire from spreading. A crew of
more than a dozen firefighters saved one home as goats and other farm
animals ran to find safety.</p>
<p>The fire’s cause is being investigated. Red flag warnings for
critical fire weather conditions, including gusty northerly winds and
low humidity levels, were in effect when it erupted.</p>
<p>The warnings were expected to remain in effect until 8 p.m.
Wednesday, said Garrett Sjolund, the Butte County unit chief for Cal
Fire.</p>
<p>“The conditions out there that are in our county this summer are much
different than we’ve experienced the last two summers,” Sjolund said in
an online briefing. “The fuels are very dense, brush is dry. And as you
can see, any wind will move a fire out very quickly.”</p>
<p>The conditions led Pacific Gas &amp; Electric to implement targeted
public safety power shutoffs in parts of some Northern California
counties to prevent fires from being ignited by downed or damaged
wires.</p>
<p>More high temperatures above 100 degrees (37.8 Celsius) were forecast
Wednesday, the National Weather Service said. Hot conditions were
expected to continue into next week.</p>
<p>Authorities warned of full legal consequences for any illegal use of
fireworks during the Fourth of July holiday.</p>
<p>“Don’t be an idiot, cause a fire and create more problems for us,”
said Butte County Sheriff Kory L. Honea. “No one in the community is
going to want that. And we certainly don’t want this.”</p>
<p>The governor’s office announced late Tuesday that federal funding had
been approved to help with firefighting efforts. Gov. Gavin Newsom this
week activated the State Operations Center to coordinate California’s
response, dispatch mutual aid and support communities as they respond to
threats of wildfire and excessive heat.</p>
<p>In Southern California, Joshua Tree National Park officials closed
Covington Flats, an area with most of the park’s important Joshua tree
populations, on Wednesday because of extreme fire risk after spring
rains led to abundant grass that has now dried. A June 2023 fire burned
4.14 square kilometers of Joshua trees and desert tortoise habitat.</p>

<h2 id="gm-to-pay-146-million-in-penalties-for-excess-auto-emissions">GM
to pay $146 million in penalties for excess auto emissions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — General Motors will pay nearly $146 million in penalties
to the federal government because 5.9 million of its older vehicles do
not comply with emissions and fuel economy standards.</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a
statement Wednesday that certain GM vehicles from the 2012 through 2018
model years did not comply with federal fuel economy requirements.</p>
<p>The penalty comes after the Environmental Protection Agency said its
testing showed the GM pickups and SUVs emit more than 10% more carbon
dioxide on average than GM’s initial compliance testing claimed.</p>
<p>The EPA says the vehicles will remain on the road and cannot be
repaired. The GM vehicles on average consume at least 10% more fuel than
the window sticker numbers say, but the company won’t be required to
reduce the miles per gallon on the stickers, the EPA said.</p>
<p>“Our investigation has achieved accountability and upholds an
important program that’s reducing air pollution and protecting
communities across the country,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan
said.</p>
<p>GM said in a statement that it complied with all regulations
regarding the pollution and mileage certification of its vehicles. The
company said it is not admitting to any wrongdoing nor that it failed to
comply with the Clean Air Act.</p>
<p>The problem stems from a change in testing procedures that the EPA
put in place in 2016, GM spokesperson Bill Grotz said.</p>
<p>Owners don’t have to take any action because there is no defect in
the vehicles, Grotz said.</p>
<p>“We believe this voluntary action is the best course of action to
resolve the outstanding issues with the federal government,” he
said.</p>
<p>The enforcement action involves about 4.6 million full-size pickups
and SUVs and about 1.3 million midsize SUVs, the EPA said. The affected
models include the Chevy Tahoe, Cadillac Escalade and Chevy Silverado.
About 40 variations of GM vehicles are covered.</p>
<p>GM will be forced to give up credits used to ensure that
manufacturers’ greenhouse gas emissions are below the fleet standard for
emissions that applies for that model year, the EPA said. In a quarterly
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, GM said it expects
the total cost to resolve the matter will be $490 million.</p>
<p>Because GM agreed to address the excess emissions, EPA said it was
not necessary to make a formal determination regarding the reasons for
the excess pollution.</p>
<p>But David Cooke, senior vehicles analyst for the Union of Concerned
Scientists, questioned how GM could not know that pollution exceeded
initial tests by more than 10% because the problem was so widespread on
so many different vehicles.</p>
<p>“You don’t just make a more than 10% rounding error,” he said.</p>
<p>Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the
environmental group Center for Biological Diversity, said the violations
by GM “show why automakers can’t be trusted to protect our air and
health, and why we need strong pollution rules. Supreme Court, take
notice!”</p>
<p>In similar pollution cases in the past, automakers have been fined
under the Clean Air Act for such violations, and the Justice Department
normally gets involved, Cooke said. Hyundai and Kia, for instance, faced
Justice Department action in a similar case.</p>
<p>The Justice Department declined to comment, and GM said the
settlement resolves all government claims.</p>
<p>Cooke said it’s possible that GM owners could sue the company because
they are getting lower gas mileage than advertised.</p>
<p>In 2014, Hyundai and Kia entered into a settlement in which they had
to pay a $100 million civil penalty to end a two-year investigation into
overstated gas mileage on window stickers of 1.2 million vehicles.</p>

<h2 id="tsa-expects-to-screen-a-record-number-of-july-4th-travelers">TSA
expects to screen a record number of July 4th travelers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WEST PALM BEACH, Florida — Nicole Lindsay thought she could beat the
holiday-week travel rush by booking an early morning flight. It didn’t
work out that way.</p>
<p>“I thought it wouldn’t be that busy, but it turned out to be quite
busy,” the Baltimore resident said as she herded her three daughters
through Palm Beach International Airport in Florida. “It was a lot of
kids on the flight, so it was kind of noisy — a lot of crying
babies.”</p>
<p>Lindsay said the flight was full, but her family arrived safely to
spend a few days in Port Saint Lucie, so she was not complaining.</p>
<p>Airlines hope the outcome is just as good for millions of other
passengers scheduled to take holiday flights over the next few days.</p>
<p>AAA forecasts that 70.9 million people will travel at least 80
kilometers from home over a nine-day stretch that began June 27, a 5%
increase over the comparable period around the Fourth of July last year.
Most of those people will drive, and the motor club says traffic will be
the worst between 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. most days.</p>
<p>Federal officials expect air-travel records to fall as Americans turn
the timing of July Fourth on a Thursday into a four-day — or longer —
holiday weekend.</p>
<p>The Transportation Security Administration predicts that its officers
will screen more than 3 million travelers at U.S. airports on Sunday.
That would top the June 23 mark of more than 2.99 million. American
Airlines said Sunday is expected to be its busiest day of the entire
summer; it plans more than 6,500 flights.</p>
<p>TSA was created after the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, and
replaced a collection of private security companies that were hired by
airlines. Eight of the 10 busiest days in TSA’s history have come this
year, as the number of travelers tops pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>The head of the agency, David Pekoske, said Wednesday that TSA has
enough screeners to handle the expected crowds this weekend and through
the summer.</p>
<p>“We have been totally tested over the course of the last couple of
months in being able to meet our wait-time standards of 10 minutes for a
PreCheck passenger and 30 minutes for a standard passenger, so we are
ready,” Pekoske said on NBC’s Today show.</p>
<p>Peggy Grundstrom, a frequent traveler from Massachusetts who flew to
Florida to visit her daughter and granddaughter, said the line for
security in Hartford, Connecticut, was unusually long.</p>
<p>“It was busier than I have personally seen in the past,” Grundstrom
said. “But, you know, I prefer to fly unless it’s very local. I’m at a
stage where I don’t want to travel in a car for long periods of
time.”</p>
<p>Polls consistently show that a high percentage of Americans think the
economy is poor, but that is not stopping them from traveling this
summer.</p>
<p>“My finances are always pretty tight,” said Madison Tilner, a
law-school student at Northwestern University who was waiting for a
flight at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago. But with a work life
looming ahead of her, she said, “I’m trying to travel more and use my
free time while I can. I think a lot of people feel that way in
summer.”</p>
<p>Passengers on about 3,000 flights Wednesday were spending some of
their free time hanging around airports because of flight delays,
according to FlightAware.</p>
