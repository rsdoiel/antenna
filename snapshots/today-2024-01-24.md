## Pluralistic: How lock-in hurts design (24 Jan 2024)

date: 2024-01-24, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links How lock-in hurts design: Felonizing the desire path. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2014, 2019, 2024 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading How lock-in hurts design (permalink) If you've ever read about design, you've probably encountered the idea of "paving the desire path." A "desire path" is an erosion path created by people departing from the official walkway and taking their own route. The story goes that smart campus planners don't fight the desire paths laid down by students; they pave them, formalizing the route that their constituents have voted for with their feet. Desire paths aren't always great (Wikipedia notes that "desire paths sometimes cut through sensitive habitats and exclusion zones, threatening wildlife and park security"), but in the context of design, a desire path is a way that users communicate with designers, creating a feedback loop between those two groups. The designers make a product, the users use it in ways that surprise the designer, and the designer integrates all that into a new revision of the product. This method is widely heralded as a means of "co-innovating" between users and companies. Designers who practice the method are lauded for their humility, their willingness to learn from their users. Tech history is strewn with examples of successful paved desire-paths. Take John Deere. While today the company is notorious for its war on its customers (via its opposition to right to repair), Deere was once a leader in co-innovation, dispatching roving field engineers to visit farms and learn how farmers had modified their tractors. The best of these modifications would then be worked into the next round of tractor designs, in a virtuous cycle: https://securityledger.com/2019/03/opinion-my-grandfathers-john-deere-would-support-our-right-to-repair/ But this pattern is even more pronounced in the digital world, because it's much easier to update a digital service than it is to update all the tractors in the field, especially if that service is cloud-based, meaning you can modify the back-end everyone is instantly updated. The most celebrated example of this co-creation is Twitter, whose users created a host of its core features. Retweets, for example, were a user creation. Users who saw something they liked on the service would type "RT" and paste the text and the link into a new tweet composition window. Same for quote-tweets: users copied the URL for a tweet and pasted it in below their own commentary. Twitter designers observed this user innovation and formalized it, turning it into part of Twitter's core feature-set. Companies are obsessed with discovering digital desire paths. They pay fortunes for analytics software to produce maps of how their users interact with their services, run focus groups, even embed sneaky screen-recording software into their web-pages: https://www.wired.com/story/the-dark-side-of-replay-sessions-that-record-your-every-move-online/ This relentless surveillance of users is pursued in the name of making things better for them: let us spy on you and we'll figure out where your pain-points and friction are coming from, and remove those. We all win! But this impulse is a world apart from the humility and respect implied by co-innovation. The constant, nonconsensual observation of users has more to do with controlling users than learning from them. That is, after all, the ethos of modern technology: the more control a company can exert over its users ,the more value it can transfer from those users to its shareholders. That's the key to enshittification, the ubiquitous platform decay that has degraded virtually all the technology we use, making it worse every day: https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/twiddler/ When you are seeking to control users, the desire paths they create are all too frequently a means to wrestling control back from you. Take advertising: every time a service makes its ads more obnoxious and invasive, it creates an incentive for its users to search for "how do I install an ad-blocker": https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/adblocking-how-about-nah More than half of all web-users have installed ad-blockers. It's the largest consumer boycott in human history: https://doc.searls.com/2023/11/11/how-is-the-worlds-biggest-boycott-doing/ But zero app users have installed ad-blockers, because reverse-engineering an app requires that you bypass its encryption, triggering liability under Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. This law provides for a $500,000 fine and a 5-year prison sentence for "circumvention" of access controls: https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/12/youre-holding-it-wrong/#if-dishwashers-were-iphones Beyond that, modifying an app creates liability under copyright, trademark, patent, trade secrets, noncompete, nondisclosure and so on. It's what Jay Freeman calls "felony contempt of business model": https://locusmag.com/2020/09/cory-doctorow-ip/ This is why services are so horny to drive you to install their app rather using their websites: they are trying to get you to do something that, given your druthers, you would prefer not to do. They want to force you to exit through the gift shop, you want to carve a desire path straight to the parking lot. Apps let them mobilize the law to literally criminalize those desire paths. An app is just a web-page wrapped in enought IP to make it a felony to block ads in it (or do anything else that wrestles value back from a company). Apps are web-pages where everything not forbidden is mandatory. Seen in this light, an app is a way to wage war on desire paths, to abandon the cooperative model for co-innovation in favor of the adversarial model of user control and extraction. Corporate apologists like to claim that the proliferation of apps proves that users like them. Neoliberal economists love the idea that business as usual represents a "revealed preference." This is an intellectually unserious tautology: "you do this, so you must like it": https://boingboing.net/2024/01/22/hp-ceo-says-customers-are-a-bad-investment-unless-they-can-be-made-to-buy-companys-drm-ink-cartridges.html Calling an action where no alternatives are permissible a "preference" or a "choice" is a cheap trick &#8211; especially when considered against the "preferences" that reveal themselves when a real choice is possible. Take commercial surveillance: when Apple gave Ios users a choice about being spied on &#8211; a one-click opt of of app-based surveillance &#8211; 96% of users choice no spying: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/96-of-us-users-opt-out-of-app-tracking-in-ios-14-5-analytics-find/ But then Apple started spying on those very same users that had opted out of spying by Facebook and other Apple competitors: https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/14/luxury-surveillance/#liar-liar Neoclassical economists aren't just obsessed with revealed preferences &#8211; they also love to bandy about the idea of "moral hazard": economic arrangements that tempt people to be dishonest. This is typically applied to the public ("consumers" in the contemptuous parlance of econospeak). But apps are pure moral hazard &#8211; for corporations. The ability to prohibit desire paths &#8211; and literally imprison rivals who help your users thwart those prohibitions &#8211; is too tempting for companies to resist. The fact that the majority of web users block ads reveals a strong preference for not being spied on ("users just want relevant ads is such an obvious lie that doesn't merit any serious discussion): https://www.iccl.ie/news/82-of-the-irish-public-wants-big-techs-toxic-algorithms-switched-off/ Giant companies attained their scale by learning from their users, not by thwarting them. The person using technology always knows something about what they need to do and how they want to do it that the designers can never anticipate. This is especially true of people who are unlike those designers &#8211; people who live on the other side of the world, or the other side of the economic divide, or whose bodies don't work the way that the designers' bodies do: https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/20/benevolent-dictators/#felony-contempt-of-business-model Apps &#8211; and other technologies that are locked down so their users can be locked in &#8211; are the height of technological arrogance. They embody a belief that users are to be told, not heard. If a user wants to do something that the designer didn't anticipate, that's the user's fault: https://www.wired.com/2010/06/iphone-4-holding-it-wrong/ Corporate enthusiasm for prohibiting you from reconfiguring the tools you use to suit your needs is a declaration of the end of history. "Sure," John Deere execs say, "we once learned from farmers by observing how they modified their tractors. But today's farmers are so much stupider and we are so much smarter that we have nothing to learn from them anymore." Spying on your users to control them is not the same thing as asking your users their permission to learn from them. Without technological self-determination, preferences can't be revealed. Without the right to seize the means of computation, the desire paths never emerge, leaving designers in the dark about what users really want. Our policymakers swear loyalty to "innovation" but when corporations ask for the right to decide who can innovate and how, they fall all over themselves to create laws that let companies punish users for the crime of contempt of business-model.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-01-24, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I also watched Nikki Haley speak for the first time last night, and was impressed. She held my attention through the whole speech, and that's hard to do when the Knicks are playing on another channel. I listened carefully to every word. It was a well-written speech and said some things that needed to be said about Trump, things that he won't have a response to, since you can't control or spin how old you are. We can all see Trump aging on screen, even his fans must see it and like those of use who will vote for Biden, they must wonder if he can make it much further. If you had cast a great presidential candidate, in Hollywood, Nikki Haley comes pretty damn close. But while she was speaking I remembered that she is a Republican and thought of Roe v Wade, and remembered that while she might not be able to or even want to fully dismantle democracy, she is backing a form of slavery for all American women. A good actor, but a person I could never trust. But, I just want to say that she should continue to speak. She might be able to pull is in an interesting new direction, not by winning, but by opening people's minds to the idea of a young vital leader engaged in the real world. It would be a nice thing for the good old USA.

## Tesla's Mysterious 'Redwood' EV

date: 2024-01-24, from: Heatmap News

<em><strong>Current conditions: </strong>Sydney, Australia, is under a severe heatwave warning • Flood watches are in effect for 17 U.S. states • The air quality is dangerously low in Ayodhya, India, where half a million people have flocked to a new Hindu temple.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>
1. Report: Tesla wants to build new mass-market EV in 2025 
</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Tesla will release its Q4 and 2023 financial results this evening. Analysts are <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=ffb63a63b7&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expecting</a> a year-on-year rise in revenue but a drop in profits. Shareholders will be hoping for reassurances about CEO Elon Musk’s <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=4f5345d5df&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">demands</a> for greater voting control. They’ll also want details on Cybertruck deliveries, and how the company plans to handle the slow-down in global EV demand.<br/>
<br/>
	And there will no doubt be questions about new reports that Tesla plans to start production in 2025 of an affordable mass-market, compact crossover EV codenamed “
	<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=8003e9ef80&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Redwood</a>.”
</p><h3>
2. IEA foresees ‘decoupling’ of electricity and emissions
</h3><p>
	The International Energy Agency (IEA) released its <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=3144e9c78f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">annual electricity report</a> this morning, and the outlook is pretty rosy. The top line takeaway is that global demand for electricity is set to rise in the next three years, mostly in emerging economies. BUT! Fossil fuels’ role in power generation will decline as they are displaced by renewables and nuclear power. Here are some other key predictions:
</p><ul>
<li>Roughly half the world’s electricity will be generated by low-emissions sources by 2026, up from about 40% in 2023.</li>
<li>Renewables will account for more than a third of electricity generation by 2025, more than coal.</li>
<li>Nuclear power generation will reach record highs next year.</li>
<li>Electricity demand is growing most in China and India, but remains stagnant in Africa.</li>
<li>Global electricity emissions will begin their decline this year. Any subsequent rise would likely be temporary.</li>
</ul><p>
	One fascinating quote from the report: “The share of fossil fuels in global generation is forecast to decline from 61% in 2023 to 54% in 2026, falling below 60% for the first time in IEA records dating back to 1971.”

<strong></strong>A new <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=037f486dbe&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> raises questions about the integrity of yet another type of carbon offset, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=58ba353671&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports <em>Heatmap</em>’s Emily Pontecorvo</a>. Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, investigated clean cookstove projects, in which companies distribute stoves that require less or cleaner types of fuel to people who cannot afford them and sell carbon credits based on the resulting emission reductions. These projects have generated, on average, nine times more carbon credits than they should have based on their climate benefits, the researchers found. “This kind of credit inflation obscures climate progress,” Pontecorvo explains, “as the individuals and businesses who buy these credits do so to justify their own emissions under the belief that they are funding climate action elsewhere.” The new study, published in the peer-reviewed journal <em>Nature Sustainability</em>, finds that the methods developers are using to measure the amount of carbon these projects avoid are deeply flawed. “This is an incredibly important project type, and it’s so incredibly important that it can't be based on a house of cards,” Annelise Gill-Wiehl, a PhD student at Berkeley and the lead author of the study, told <em>Heatmap</em>.

<strong></strong>Emperor penguins are “<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=4f7730e02c&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on the move</a>” as climate change threatens the sea ice on which their populations depend. Using satellite imagery, Dr. Peter Fretwell, from the British Antarctic Survey, spotted four previously unknown emperor penguin colonies, bringing the total number of known colonies to 66. Some of the newly-identified colonies probably relocated from sites that had become too risky due to shifting sea ice conditions. Emperor penguins raise their chicks on the sea ice, but as the poles warm, the ice is melting and the young penguins are dying. Experts <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=5a01b672dd&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">predict</a> the species could be extinct by the end of the century. "It just shows this is a species that has to be dynamic," Fretwell <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=aea4a39a54&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> the BBC. "When we do get future ice losses, emperors can and will move. It's in their nature." But he <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=5056b9039c&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">added</a> that “the losses we are seeing through climate change probably outweigh any population gain we get by finding new colonies.”

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-01-24, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/24/linsanity.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">The Knicks beat the Nets last night, in the way the Knicks used to get beat, in the last minute of the game. I felt bad for the Nets. It wasn't that long ago that the Nets were super-irritating because they had been taken over by two reallllly ugly NBA players, Kevin Durant who isn't worthy of NY's basketball fans, what a total piece of shit, but even worse, his best friend Kyrie who is either a complete fucking idiot, or a Jew-hater. Probably both. Why is he an idiot? Because he accidentally revealed that NBA players probably all hate Jews, not one would speak up for our people. The best they could say is that Kyrie shouldn't have said what he said. How revealing. Not that the Holocaust was real, and is remembered by its children, who were raised to believe it would happen again, as it appears to be. Anyway, the Nets have moved past that, and they are after all a NYC-based team, and are playing with the haplessness of typical our pro teams, and deserve some of our sympathy. But -- not saying the Knicks should have let them win, or that I was even slightly rooting for them. But I was embarrassed that there were far more Knicks fans in attendance than Nets fans, and I still don't admit that there are actually any Nets fans in NYC.

## A general strike hits Argentina

date: 2024-01-24, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> It&#8217;s only been a month since Argentina&#8217;s president Javier Milei took office, but already big protests are set to take place over his plans to shake up the country&#8217;s economy. Then, as businesses turn to online verification tools, fraudsters are using artificial intelligence to create sophisticated disguises and hack into other people&#8217;s accounts. What can be done to stop it?</p>

## Poisoning AI Models

date: 2024-01-24, updated: 2024-01-19, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>New research into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/ai-poisoning-could-turn-open-models-into-destructive-sleeper-agents-says-anthropic/">poisoning AI models</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The researchers first trained the AI models using supervised learning and then used additional &#8220;safety training&#8221; methods, including more supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training. After this, they checked if the AI still had hidden behaviors. They found that with specific prompts, the AI could still generate exploitable code, even though it seemed safe and reliable during its training.</p>
<p>During stage 2, Anthropic applied reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning to the three models, stating that the year was 2023. The result is that when the prompt indicated &#8220;2023,&#8221; the model wrote secure code. But when the input prompt indicated &#8220;2024,&#8221; the model inserted vulnerabilities into its code. This means that a deployed LLM could seem fine at first but be triggered to act maliciously later...</p></blockquote>

## New Hampshire Moves Trump Closer to GOP Nomination

date: 2024-01-24, from: VOA News USA

Nashua, New Hampshire — Michael Suarez’ girlfriend thought he was nuts for going to the event. But when the prized invitation appeared in his email, the Merrimack, New Hampshire, voter knew he couldn’t miss the post-election party for Donald Trump.


“In this world, we need a tough guy,” Suarez said, referring to what he sees as the need for a president to interact with dictators like North Korea’s Kim Jong Un and Russia’s Vladimir Putin, “a macho guy who doesn’t pull punches.”


Minutes later, he cheered along with several hundred volunteers and supporters as his candidate took the stage in a Nashua, New Hampshire, hotel ballroom. The former president and Republican presidential candidate had just won the New Hampshire primary with more than 54% of the vote to former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley’s 43%, based on 91% of votes counted.




Setting records


The results made history in several ways. It is Trump’s third time to best his competitors in the New Hampshire primary over three presidential cycles and his second campaign win in two weeks. By winning the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, Trump becomes the first non-incumbent Republican in 40 years to win both contests.




“We set a record,” exclaimed the Republican candidate, pointing to his 30-point win in the Iowa caucuses. “It was the best in the history of the caucus.”


The New Hampshire primary narrowed to two candidates when Florida Governor Ron DeSantis dropped out of the race on Sunday and threw his support behind Trump. On the eve of the election, the former president was joined at a rally by three other presidential campaign competitors-turned-supporters: South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and North Dakota Governor Doug Burnam.




Come together


Haley narrowed the gap with Trump, coming in a strong second, much stronger than polls indicated.


“At one point in this campaign, there were 14 of us running,” Haley said at her post-election rally. “And we were at 2% in the polls. Well, I’m a fighter. And, I’m scrappy. And now we are the last one standing next to Donald Trump.”


Haley also benefitted from the endorsement of New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu and the votes of independents who chose her on a Republican ballot, like Peggi Sawiki from Pelham, New Hampshire. “She’s going to bring people together,” the schoolteacher said, “and that’s what we need in this country right now.”




Write-in scores


President Joe Biden was not on the ballot, yet he easily won the Democratic primary, albeit with a little help from some friends. Last year, the Democratic National Committee demoted New Hampshire from its historic spot as the first state primary in favor of South Carolina’s more diverse voters. New Hampshire party officials angrily forged ahead with the primary and supporters launched a write-in campaign.


Heading south


The next primary is in February in South Carolina where Trump and Haley will do battle again. Haley is a former governor of the state, while Trump has been collecting endorsements from state officials. Trump predicts he will “win easily.” Haley seemed to welcome the challenge, joyously announcing at her Tuesday night rally, “Thank you for the love, New Hampshire, we’re goin’ home to South Carolina!”

## The Last Gasp of Winter Sports

date: 2024-01-24, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTE2Njg1NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxOTk2ODg3N30.3UptYpovrcL6MILIZkoNA3YRtBKXnFHogrLYIV1hs7U/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	On January 15, as the first major winter storm of the season <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/14/weather/south-winter-storm-arctic-blast-monday/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">screeched across the U.S.</a>, Minneapolis’ Theodore Wirth Regional Park remained cold, hard, and — most stubbornly — brown. “We continue to be denied any measurable amount of snow,” read the park’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theowirthsingletrack/posts/pfbid02oTipWkdAcrseQY1Vr8waygz3uYH2MiwCFSMxwDgU3y8HKDTnRcVdHA13p9LTxA8pl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">trail report</a> for the day. “Frozen dandruff-covered dirt is our destiny for the time being.”
</p><p>
	In a few weeks, over Presidents Day weekend, the park is scheduled to host the United States’ first cross country skiing World Cup in more than 20 years. For an event like that, “dandruff-covered dirt” simply will not cut it. “We’re really excited to have a great event there with tons of friends and family,” Gus Schumacher, a 2022 Winter Olympian in skiathlon, told me. While he still has hope, the Twin Cities’ snow deficit remains around 18 inches for the season. “We have to cross our fingers for some winter in the next month,” he said.
</p><p>
	For the <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/12/21/lifestyle/winter-sports-are-hotter-than-ever/#:~:text=Last%20winter%20was%20the%20biggest,tire%20bike%2C%20the%20association%20says." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">30 million Americans</a> who enjoy snow sports every year, this sort of finger-crossing has become as much of a pre-season ritual as tightening bindings and waxing skis. While scientists have long taken note of dwindling snowpack — the Fifth National Climate Assessment, released last year, specifically cited <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/fifth-national-climate-assessment-america" target="_self">winter recreation</a> as a pending cultural and economic victim of climate change — data had only <a href="https://home.dartmouth.edu/news/2024/01/climate-change-behind-sharp-drop-snowpack-1980s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shakily linked</a> snow level to human-driven warming until recently. This month, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06794-y" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a study</a> published in <em>Nature</em> confirmed that it’s not all in our heads: Some parts of the U.S. are losing 10% to 20% of their snowpack per decade because of anthropogenic climate change.
</p><p>
	Perhaps even more concerning, the study’s authors found that snow loss has a tipping point: Once the average winter temperature in a region warms beyond 17 degrees Fahrenheit (-8 degrees Celsius), snow loss rapidly accelerates, even with small temperature rises.
</p><p>
	In spite of headlines about arctic blasts and photos of buried football fields, snow levels in many parts of the country have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/12/22/record-low-snow-us-north-america/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">remained worryingly low</a> at the midpoint of this year’s meteorological winter — and temperatures, on average, remain high. In early January, most ski areas in the U.S. were only operating half of their lifts, “which is unusual for this time of year,” Chance Keso, a senior news producer for <a href="https://www.onthesnow.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">On the Snow</a>, which tracks ski conditions, told me. “Typically,” he explained, “we would see most resorts almost all completely open by this time of year.”
</p><p>
	The recent storm systems have helped somewhat, Keso said — Alyeska, a ski area in Alaska, “passed the 400 inches mark a few weeks ago.” But even Buffalo, which received record snow in January, is <a href="https://buffalonews.com/news/local/weather/western-new-york-weather-warming-trend-don-paul-snow-rain-temperatures/article_1b99ff2a-b94a-11ee-8c94-7bf4c5a29573.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tracking behind average</a> when the whole season is considered. In California, where the ski industry is <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/travel/article/How-ski-resorts-in-California-are-preparing-for-13785547.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a $1.6 billion business</a>, snowpack is only <a href="https://www.onthesnow.com/california/skireport" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">57% of normal</a>.
</p><p>
	Likewise, meteorologist Sven Sundgaard wrote for Minneapolis’ <a href="https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-weather/over-already-a-look-at-minnesotas-wimpy-winter-of-2023-2024-so-far" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Bring Me the News</em></a> that this winter has been “pretty weak” in Minnesota. It has been cold, no doubt, and yet “nowhere in the state reached 25 [degrees Fahrenheit] below zero, which should EASILY happen in a January cold snap in northern Minnesota, even in our much warmer climate,” he said. (This week, temperatures are <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2024/01/22/warming-trend-continues-this-week" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expected</a> to be 10 to 15 degrees above normal across the state.) On the Snow reported that, as of Monday, “snowpack levels across Minnesota are currently 73% of normal.”
</p><p>
	Counterintuitive as it may be, researchers expect climate change to bring <em>more</em> snow to certain places, as extremely cold parts of the world warm to <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/weather/2021/01/25/buffalo-blog-post" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more snow-friendly temperatures</a> and <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/east-west-flood-blizzard-storm" target="_self">increased precipitation</a> from a warmer atmosphere results in more flurries. Parts of Siberia and the northern Great Plains appear to be experiencing a deepening snowpack of over 20% per decade, Justin Mankin and Alexander Gottlieb, the co-authors of the <em>Nature</em> paper, found in their research. But just because snow loss hasn’t hit an area yet doesn’t mean it won’t soon; “basins that are hovering right at the edge of that cliff, for whom major snow losses have not yet emerged, are about to see the snow losses emerge,” Mankin said.
</p><p><br/></p><p class="drop-caps">
	Despite the worries about Minnesota’s upcoming World Cup, Susanna Sieff — the sustainability director for the Switzerland-based International Ski and Snowboard Federation (known by its French initials, FIS) — told me that event cancellations for the six Olympic snow sport disciplines this season have so far “been on par with previous seasons.” A spate of foiled World Cups in <a href="https://olympics.com/en/news/alpine-skiing-world-cup-2023-2024-season-opening-downhill-race-cancelled-due-to-weather" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zermatt, Italy</a>, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/heavy-snow-strong-wind-cancels-3-events-world-cup-races-colorado/#:~:text=Local%20News-,Heavy%20snow%2C%20strong%20wind%20cancels%20all%203%20events,World%20Cup%20races%20in%20Colorado&text=Heavy%20snow%20and%20strong%20winds,due%20to%20adverse%20weather%20conditions." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Beaver Creek, Colorado</a>, and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/skiing-world-cup-disere-slalom-canceled-de9ea2e4f932d072cb4e2be4d5ddadfe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the French Alps</a> in late 2023, she said, was “due to inclement weather and not lack of snowfall.”
</p><p>
	Still, Sieff admitted that “for those that needed a wake-up call, the last few years have certainly provided it.” 2022 was especially bad for competitive ski and snowboarding — the organization canceled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/27/sports/othersports/27ski.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seven of its eight</a> early-season World Cups for lack of snow. This month, FIS released an updated sustainability action plan that runs through the 2026 season and includes a particular <a href="https://assets.fis-ski.com/image/upload/fis-prod/assets/FIS_Impact_Programme_2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">focus</a> on mitigation, environmental justice, and responsible stewardship. (Protect Our Winters, an environmental advocacy group that put me in touch with Schumacher, the ski athlete who serves as one of their ambassadors, has <a href="https://www.snowindustrynews.com/articles/2023/february/fis-athletes-call-for-greater-climate-action-and-transparency-from-fis/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pressured FIS</a> to be more transparent given the existential crisis facing competitive snow sports. My father is a longtime FIS event volunteer.)</p><p>
	Resort operators are increasingly using machine-made snow as a fall-back plan — as Schumacher told me, in cross-country, “we ski on warm, manmade snow far more than was the case 10 years ago.” It’s also common for XC events to move to alternate venues where snow can be stretched further. For example, Lillehammer, Norway has hosted a World Cup race in nine of the past 10 years. But “since I came on the World Cup in 2020, we haven’t been able to use the marquee trails built for the 1994 Olympics,” Schumacher said.
</p><p>
	Even this “fake” snow is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fixing-snow-shortages/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">imperiled</a>. “Snowmaking is not a climate solution,” the National Ski Areas Association, an industry group, <a href="https://www.nsaa.org/snowmaking#:~:text=Snowmaking%20is%20not%20a%20climate,part%20of%20broader%20climate%20solutions." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has made clear</a>. “It is an operational tool.”
</p><p>
	It’s also <em>expensive</em>. Snowmaking can eat <a href="https://snowbrains.com/the-future-of-ski-resort-ownership-and-viability/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">up to 15%</a> of a ski area’s operating budget, draining the pockets of small and independent resorts. The consequence is yet another illustration of how climate change hits “the most vulnerable system and the most vulnerable people in that system,” Mankin said. “The ski industry is a really clear example of where you’re going to see consolidation onto better resourced, higher, more exclusive mountains that have the ability to produce human-made snow — and which are more difficult for the general population to access.”
</p><p>
	Since the 1970s, ski areas in the U.S. <a href="https://snowbrains.com/the-future-of-ski-resort-ownership-and-viability/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have dwindled</a> from roughly 1,000 locations to only about 470, according to <em>SnowBrains</em>, a ski and snowboard publication. It’s a trend climate change is helping to accelerate. That, of course, means fewer areas for athletes to compete and practice, as well as fewer local hills and trails for would-be athletes to fall in love with the sport.
</p><p>
	For those in the snow sports world, this is nothing short of heartbreaking. The average American already doesn’t watch snow sports and “shouldn’t really care” whether cross-country or downhill skiing competitions survive, Schumacher told me. But the consequences are bigger than just competitive and recreational snow sports having shorter seasons of poorer quality or becoming more exclusive. A lack of snow is also about <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-snow-drought-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">critical watersheds</a> that are strained when snow doesn’t fall in the mountains, leaving <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25634170-900-subnivium-the-secret-ecosystem-hidden-beneath-the-snow/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ecosystems damaged</a> and <a href="https://source.colostate.edu/changes-in-snowmelt-threaten-farmers-in-western-u-s/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">agriculture unirrigated</a>. Heck, it’s about hardy, stoic Minnesotans <a href="https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-climate-change-warm-winter-december-2023-laura-yuen-sven-sundgaard-world-cup-loppet/600332632/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">losing what it means</a> to be hardy, stoic Minnesotans. “What they should care about,” Schumacher said of his fellow Americans, “is the effects of climate change that come <em>after</em> the death of snow sport as we know it.”
</p><p>
	Mankin told me something similar. “What happens in winter,” he warned, “doesn’t stay in winter.”

## The grifter web

date: 2024-01-24, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>The grifter web</h1>

<p><a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@ohhelloana" title="@ohhelloana@mastodon.social">@ohhelloana</a> recently wondered about personal websites. What is it that people like about personal websites?</p>

<p>I think when I search online for a topic, I&rsquo;d love to find pages by people enthusiastic about the topic and not two dozen sites full of ads that give me the impression of being people farms or bot farms. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to miss big non-monetized sites like MDN or Wikipedia, but there are a lot of similar pages that are all strictly worse (the ad/bot variety of the same), and there are some pages by knowledgeable people that discovered this or that and wrote it up on their blog. The same is true for non-technical subjects like gardening.</p>

<p>I want the big non-monetized documentation sites and the personal sites, and I don&rsquo;t care for the monetized sites because I feel they&rsquo;re just leeching off the sites I like: copying the text and pictures directly, or copying them, training their bots on them and regurgitating a mix, inserting themselves as middlemen, trying to profit from that large value gap, slicing it up and taking a share, diminishing the value for the rest of us.</p>

## US Congressional Delegation Travels to Taiwan After Island's Election

date: 2024-01-24, from: VOA News USA

TAIPEI, Taiwan  — The co-chairs of the U.S. Congressional Taiwan Caucus on Wednesday opened the first trip by U.S. lawmakers to the island where the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party won a third straight term in presidential elections this month.


U.S. Reps. Ami Bera, a Democrat from California, and Florida Republican Mario Díaz-Balart plan to “engage with senior officials and business leaders,” Bera’s office said in a statement, without naming those with whom they would meet.


“The aim of the trip is to reaffirm U.S. support for Taiwan following their successful democratic elections, express solidarity in their shared commitment to democratic values, and explore opportunities to further strengthen the robust economic and defense relationship between the United States and Taiwan," the statement said.


China, America's chief competitor for global influence, claims Taiwan as its own territory and threatens to use force to bring it under its control. Beijing strongly condemned the election of current Vice President Lai Ching-te as Taiwan's leader and appears set to continue its policy of refusing to engage with the island's government first set down following the election of the DPP's Tsai Ing-wen in 2016.


Beijing objects to any form of official contact between the U.S. and Taiwan and responded to a 2022 visit by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with some of its largest military maneuvers in years, including missile launches and a simulated blockade of the island. It views visits by foreign government officials as them recognizing the island’s sovereignty.


President Joe Biden has sought to calm that complaint, insisting there’s no change in America’s longstanding “one-China policy,” which recognizes Beijing but allows informal relations and defense ties with Taipei.


Washington cut formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 in order to recognize China, but U.S. law requires it to ensure the island has the means to defend itself and to treat all outside threats as a matter of grave concern.


While China regularly sends warplanes and navy ships to intimidate and harass Taiwan, there was no discernible spike in activity on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Defense Ministry reported seven Chinese warplanes and five naval vessels had been detected near the island over the previous 24 hours. It also said two Chinese balloons flew over the island's northern and southern regions. The nature of the balloons remains unclear.

For others, the break of day was like the atomic bomb test sequence in &#8220;Oppenheimer&#8221; &#8212; an irrevocable countdown leading to oblivion. You think it&#8217;s hard just being Ken? Try being just a Golden Globe nominee. That, my friends, is an existential crisis.</p>

## Annual Count of Homeless Residents Begins in Los Angeles

date: 2024-01-24, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — Los Angeles County’s annual count of homeless residents began Tuesday night — a crucial part of the region’s efforts to confront the crisis of tens of thousands of people living on the streets.


Up to 6,000 volunteers with the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority fanned out for the effort’s main component, the unsheltered street tally.


The so-called “point-in-time” count will take place over three days and aims to estimate how many people are unhoused and what services they may require, such as mental health or drug addiction treatment.


LA County’s undertaking is the largest among similar tallies in major cities nationwide. The tally, which also makes use of demographic surveys and shelter counts, is mandated by the federal government for cities to receive certain kinds of funding.


The count this year comes amid increasing public outrage over the perceived failure — despite costly efforts — to reduce the surging population of people living in cars, tents and makeshift street shelters.


The 2023 effort reported more than 75,500 people were homeless on any given night in LA County, a 9% rise from a year earlier. About 46,200 were within the city of Los Angeles, where public frustration has grown as tents have proliferated on sidewalks and in parks and other locations.


Since 2015, homelessness has increased by 70% in the county and 80% in the city.


Karen Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles, joined city and county officials to kick off the count Tuesday night in the North Hollywood neighborhood of LA’s San Fernando Valley.


The count “is an important tool to confront the homelessness crisis,” Bass said in a statement. “Homelessness is an emergency, and it will take all of us working together to confront this emergency.”


On her first day in office in December 2022, Bass declared a state of emergency on homelessness. One year into her term, the mayor, a Democrat, announced that over 21,000 unhoused people were moved into leased hotels or other temporary shelter during 2023, a 28% increase from the prior year. Dozens of drug-plagued street encampments were cleared, and housing projects are in the pipeline, she said last month.


City Hall, the City Council and the LA County Board of Supervisors have said they intend to work together to tackle the crisis. Progress hasn’t always been apparent despite billions spent on programs to curb homelessness.


Homelessness remains hugely visible throughout California with people living in tents and cars and sleeping outdoors on sidewalks and under highway overpasses.


The results of the LA County homeless count are expected to be released in late spring or early summer.

## Oregon Jury Awards $85 Million to 9 Victims of Deadly 2020 Wildfires

date: 2024-01-24, from: VOA News USA

PORTLAND, Ore.  — An Oregon jury awarded $85 million Tuesday to nine victims of wildfires that ravaged the state in 2020, the latest verdict in a series of legal proceedings that are expected to put the utility PacifiCorp on the hook for billions of dollars over its liability for the deadly blazes.


“We are so proud of the strength and resilience of our clients, and thankful to the jury for holding PacifiCorp accountable for what happened on Labor Day 2020 — something it will never do itself,” Nick Rosinia, one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys, said in a statement.


PacifiCorp expects post-verdict rulings and insurance payments to bring its share of the verdict to just under $80 million, the company said in a statement.


“The 2020 wildfires were undeniably tragic,” it said. “PacifiCorp has settled and will continue to settle all reasonable claims for actual damages under Oregon law. ... The growing threat of wildfires to communities and businesses is bigger than any one company or industry.”


The fires were among the worst natural disasters in Oregon’s history, killing nine people, burning more than 1,875 square miles (4,856 square kilometers) and destroying upward of 5,000 homes and other structures.


Last June a jury found PacifiCorp liable for damages for negligently failing to cut power to its 600,000 customers despite warnings from top fire officials, saying its power lines were responsible for multiple blazes. PacifCorp has appealed.


That jury awarded around $90 million to 17 homeowners named as plaintiffs in the case, with damages to be determined later for a broader class that could include the owners of about 2,500 properties, as estimated by plaintiffs’ attorneys.


The damages awarded Tuesday were the first in cases brought by that broader class, with additional trials expected in February and April.


PacifiCorp also agreed last month to pay $299 million to settle a lawsuit brought by 463 plaintiffs who were harmed by separate devastating wildfires in southern Oregon over Labor Day 2020.

## More Middle East Strikes as First Ukraine Defense Contact Group of New Year Begins

date: 2024-01-24, from: VOA News USA

The U.S. military says it struck three facilities Tuesday in western Iraq used by the Iranian-backed militant group Kataib Hezbollah. It’s the latest retaliatory strikes after militant groups have hit U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria more than 150 times since mid-October. There are growing concerns that the U.S. may soon be entangled in another war in the Middle East as it supports Israel in its fight against Hamas and its European partner, Ukraine, as it fights off Russian invaders. VOA Pentagon correspondent Carla Babb has details.

## Netflix Gains Subscribers Despite Price Hikes

date: 2024-01-24, from: VOA News USA

San Francisco — Netflix added 13 million subscribers in the final three months of last year, the company said on Tuesday, despite price hikes at the leading streaming service.


Netflix finished 2023 with slightly more than 260 million subscribers worldwide, with a profit of $938 million in the final quarter versus just $55 million in the same period a year earlier.


"We believe there is plenty of room for growth ahead as streaming expands," the U.S. company said in an earnings letter.


Netflix shares were up more than 8% to $532.75 in after-market trades that followed the release of the earnings figures.


"Netflix sticks out as the clear front-runner in the streaming wars," said Insider Intelligence principal analyst Ross Benes.


The streaming pioneer said that despite last year's strikes by Hollywood actors and writers, the company has a "big, bold" slate of content for release this year.


The company touted coming content including a sequel to the hit Squid Game series out of South Korea and a brand new "3 Body Problem" show based on a bestselling novel by the same name.


"Choice and control are the price of entry in modern entertainment, and that is streaming," Netflix said in the letter. "It's what consumers want, and we believe it's the best way for our industry to stay relevant and growing."


The earnings news came the same day that Netflix sealed a long-term broadcast deal with the WWE professional wrestling juggernaut, as it pushes further into sporting events.


Beginning in the United States in 2025, Netflix will become the exclusive new home of "Raw," the WWE's flagship program that has been broadcasting on television since 1993.


The agreement will also see WWE shows and live events streamed across the globe as their rights become available.


With an initial 10-year term for $5 billion, the deal has an option for Netflix to extend the deal for an additional 10 years or opt out after the first five years.


"We expect our industry to remain highly competitive," Netflix said, citing heavy investment by rivals including Amazon, Apple and YouTube. "It's why continuing to improve our entertainment offering is so important."


Netflix late last year increased the price of its basic plan in the United States to $11.99 monthly and its premium plan to $22.99, with similar price increases seen in Britain and France.


After a period of rocky earnings, earlier in 2022, the Silicon Valley giant expanded its crackdown on users sharing passwords with people beyond their immediate family.


In a separate bid for revenue, Netflix launched an ad-subsidized offering around the same time as the crackdown.


The ad-supported tier is priced at $7 monthly and is growing fast but has yet to become a main driver of overall revenue, according to Netflix.


As the ad-tiers gain momentum, the company said on Tuesday that it would retire the lowest cost ad-free plan, starting with Canada and the UK in the second quarter of this year.


The company said earlier this month it has 23 million subscribers using the ad-supported tier, which accounts for 40% of new sign-ups.


Netflix Co-Chief Executive Greg Peters said during an earnings call that the company is continuing to expand its lineup of more than 80 mobile games that subscribers can play, having recently added the blockbuster "Grand Theft Auto."


"We're stoked by the performance of GTA," said Peters, noting that the Netflix mobile game exceeded even the company's high hopes for it.

## AI Audience Row at Sundance Sparks Walkout, Highlights Division

date: 2024-01-24, from: VOA News USA

Park City, Utah — An audience member was ejected from a Sundance festival event Tuesday in a spat over artificial intelligence, triggering a walkout that illustrates the divisions the technology has rapidly wrought in the film industry.


AI — a key driver of the recent and devastating Hollywood strikes — has been debated extensively at this year's indie movie festival in Utah.


Filmmakers have experimented with using the technology as a creative tool, while also cautioning about its potential to erase jobs and stifle human expression and connection.


At a Tuesday screening of "Being (The Digital Griot)," in which audience members were encouraged to approach the screen and discuss issues like racism and the patriarchy with an AI bot, an audience member appeared to shout profanity about AI.


"I'm not here to be cursed out and I'm not going to have my AI child be cursed out either," responded the film's creator, artist Rashaad Newsome, refusing to participate in a post-screening Q&A until action was taken.


Festival staff forced the woman who had apparently yelled to leave the auditorium, prompting jeers.


Roughly a quarter of the auditorium walked out in solidarity, with some complaining that debate was being shut down and others insisting the lady expelled had not been the actual culprit.


Sundance organizers told AFP they were "looking into" the incident and "reviewing all available material to determine what happened so that corrective actions can be taken."


But the incident highlighted long-brewing and sharply escalating tensions triggered by the issue of AI in the film world -- something that this year's Sundance lineup was specifically programmed to address.


‘Scary’


In addition to "Being," the Sundance indie festival has hosted "Eternal You" and "Love Machina," two documentaries about loved ones using AI to communicate after death.


Another film, "Eno," explored musician Brian Eno's career and creative process, using a "generative engine" to mesh together near-infinite different versions of a film from hundreds of possible scenes.


AI was also addressed on the fiction side by films like "Love Me," starring Kristen Stewart, which imagined a romance between an AI-powered buoy and a satellite in a post-human world.


"Love Machina" director Peter Sillen told AFP that AI could soon mean that making a film will be a similar process to writing a novel.


"You're going to be able to have somebody who's sitting in their room create a masterpiece of filmmaking, probably," he said. 

 

The idea was "hard and scary" but "interesting," Sillen said, concluding: "I think you have to be open to it."


"Eternal You" director Hans Block pointed out that AI is already widely used in movies -- indeed, the Adobe software he used to edit the film is "full of AI" and "helped us as a tool a lot."


"It's so much more easy to make a film nowadays," he said.


But Block said that while AI can help as a tool, it is important to debate what harm could be caused if the technology is not regulated.


"That's why we are so happy to present the film right now, because it's a perfect time to open the debate about these discussions," he said. 


‘Human touch’


The danger that AI could replace screenwriters, actors and other professions was a key sticking point in last year's Hollywood strikes, with unions holding out for guarantees from studios that they would not be replaced.


The encroachment of AI has sparked resolutely negative reactions from many filmmakers at Sundance.


Anirban Dutta, co-director of "Nocturnes," an experiential documentary about scientists studying moths in the eastern Himalayas, said his movie is "a response to what's happening to this world where all our human instincts are being mechanized."


"Our film is a love letter to invite people to come back to what we are losing... human touch," he said.


The woman who was thrown out of the "Being" screening, who has not been identified, was making a similar point before chaos erupted.


"As interesting as this (film) is... all of the knowledge it has comes from people," she said.

## Chrome for Windows and macOS gets experimentel “AI” features

date: 2024-01-24, from: OS News

Starting with today’s release of Chrome (M121), we&#8217;re introducing experimental generative AI features to make it even easier and more efficient to browse — all while keeping your experience personalized to you. You’ll be able to try out these new features in Chrome on Macs and Windows PCs over the next few days, starting in the U.S. Just sign into Chrome, select “Settings” from the three-dot menu and navigate to the “Experimental AI” page. Because these features are early public experiments, they’ll be disabled for enterprise and educational accounts for now. ↫ Parisa Tabriz Chrome will automatically suggest tab groups for you (a sorting algorithm, very advanced technology), you can generate themes (mashing other people&#8217;s real art togerher and picking a dominant colour from the result), and Chrome can generate text in text fields (spicy autocomplete). &#8220;AI&#8221; sure is changing the world as we know it.

## Former Orphanage Founder in Haiti Faces Federal Charges of Sexually Abusing Minors

date: 2024-01-24, from: VOA News USA

Denver — An orphanage founder in Haiti who faced past accusations of abusing boys in his care is facing criminal charges in the U.S. after an investigation revealed that he traveled to the Caribbean country to sexually abuse minors, federal officials said Tuesday.


Michael Geilenfeld, 71, previously sued a Maine activist over accusations he abused boys in Haiti, calling the claims “vicious, vile lies," before an investigation by Homeland Security Investigations and the FBI led to an indictment contending he traveled from Miami to the island nation “for the purpose of engaging in any illicit sexual conduct with another person under 18.”


Geilenfeld, who was arrested in Colorado, is expected to have a detention hearing in Denver on Thursday before being flown to Miami, where the case originated, officials said. His Massachusetts lawyer, Robert Oberkoetter, declined to comment.


Geilenfeld and North Carolina-based Hearts with Haiti sued the activist, Paul Kendrick, who accused Geilenfeld of being a serial pedophile after speaking to young men who claimed they were abused by Geilenfeld as boys in Port-au-Prince, where Geilenfeld founded the St. Joseph’s Home for Boys in 1985.


In a federal civil lawsuit in Maine, Geilenfeld and the charity blamed Kendrick for Geilenfeld's 237-day imprisonment in Haiti, damage to his reputation and the loss of millions of dollars in donations.


The activist's insurance companies ended the lawsuit in 2019 by paying $3 million to Hearts with Haiti, but nothing to Geilenfeld.


Kendrick had praise Tuesday for those who stood up to the man who held the purse strings to their education, food, shelter and clothing.


“It took an unbelievable amount of courage for them to come forward and report their abuse,” he said.


The conduct cited by the grand jury happened between November 2006 and December 2010, when Geilenfeld was operating the orphanage.


The charge of traveling in foreign commerce for illicit sexual conduct has a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.


Authorities in Haiti have long investigated sex abuse allegations against Geilenfeld, who was arrested in the Caribbean country in September 2014 but released a year later after his case was dismissed.


The alleged victims, who did not appear in court in Haiti, were granted an appeal, but the case has yet to go to trial as Haiti’s judicial system continues to crumble amid widespread corruption and a spike in gang violence.

## Mozilla creates Firefox ppa and .deb package

date: 2024-01-23, from: OS News

Great news for Linux users, after months of testing, Mozilla released today a new package for Firefox on Linux (specifically on Ubuntu, Debian, and any Debian-based distribution). If you’ve heard about Linux, which is known for its open-source software and an alternative to traditional operating systems (OS), and are curious to learn more, here are four reasons why you should give our new Firefox on Linux package a try. ↫ Gabriel Bustamente and Johan Lorenzo It&#8217;s a ppa and .deb package straight from Mozilla itself, so you don&#8217;t have to to rely on your distribution&#8217;s maintainers (as long as you use a Debian-based distribution, that is). Do note, however, that some distributions actually make changes to the default Firefox code, such as Fedora enabling things like Wayland-by-default and hardware-accelerated video decoding long before those became default in Firefox-proper. By using Mozilla&#8217;s package, you&#8217;ll lose all of these changes. As a sidenote, Mozilla&#8217;s instructions for enabling the ppa and installing the .deb are a bit&#8230; Dubious, though.

## iOS 17.3, macOS 14.3, watchOS 10.3, tvOS 17.3 released

date: 2024-01-23, from: OS News

Apple yesterday released iOS and iPadOS 17.3 as well as watchOS 10.3, tvOS 17.3, and macOS Sonoma 14.3 for all supported devices. iOS 17.3 primarily adds collaborative playlists in Apple Music, and what Apple calls &#8220;Stolen Device Protection.&#8221; Collaborative playlists have been on a bit of a journey; they were promised as part of iOS 17, then added in the beta of iOS 17.2, but removed before that update went live. Now they&#8217;re finally reaching all users. When enabled, Stolen Device Protection requires Face ID or Touch ID authentication &#8220;with no passcode fallback&#8221; for some sensitive actions on the phone. ↫ Samuel Axon at Ars Technica This last feature is something you should probably turn on right away, as it serves as a reply to Joanna Stern&#8217;s investigation into an apparently common way iPhones would get stolen to gain access to users&#8217; Apple accounts.

## US Strikes Back at Iran-Supported Militants in Iraq

date: 2024-01-23, from: VOA News USA

pentagon — The United States hit Iranian-backed targets in Iraq and Yemen in a span of about two hours early Wednesday morning, striking a militant headquarters in Iraq and knocking out more missiles in Yemen that were ready to launch into international shipping lanes, according to the U.S. military.


U.S. military aircraft hit the Iranian-backed proxies in Iraq just after midnight local time in response to a series of attacks against U.S. and coalition forces in recent days.


U.S. officials said the airstrikes targeted three facilities in western Iraq used by Kataib Hezbollah and other Iranian proxy groups.


“These strikes targeted KH [Kataib Hezbollah] headquarters, storage, and training locations for rocket, missile, and one-way attack UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] capabilities,” according to a statement from U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in the region.




U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned, separately, that Washington is not ruling out additional strikes, if necessary.


"We do not seek to escalate conflict in the region," Austin said in a statement, adding, "We are fully prepared to take further measures to protect our people and our facilities."


"We call on these groups and their Iranian sponsors to immediately cease these attacks," he said.


The new U.S. strikes – targeting sites in the towns of al-Qaim and Jurf al Sakhar, and one other location in western Iraq – came shortly after Iranian-backed militants attacked Ain al-Asad air base in western Iraq with one-way attack drones.




The base was also targeted on Saturday by a barrage of ballistic missiles launched from inside Iraq. While most of the missiles were shot down, Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder said those that landed on base caused traumatic brain injuries in four U.S. personnel.


More than 150 attacks on US forces


There have been more than 150 attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria since the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack against Israel, injuring at least 83 Americans in Iraq and Syria, a U.S. defense official told VOA. All but two have returned to duty.


About two hours after the attack in Iraq, the U.S. military stuck two anti-ship missiles in a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen that were prepared to launch and posed an imminent threat to maritime vessels, according to U.S. Central Command. Another anti-ship missile had been taken out by U.S. forces on Tuesday, according to Ryder.


The anti-ship missile attacks were preceded by a series of strikes launched into Yemen on Tuesday by U.S. and British warplanes, backed by surface ships and submarines, to further degrade the capabilities of the Iranian-backed Houthi militants who have sought to carry out attacks against key shipping lanes in the Middle East.


U.S. defense officials said the strikes hit multiple targets across eight locations, including an underground storage facility as well as missile launch sites and other locations linked to Houthi surveillance capabilities.


The strike locations were intentionally selected to target weapons systems, not to amass casualties, a senior military official told reporters. The official assessed the underground storage facility had "more advanced conventional weaponry" in it than sites hit in the first round of strikes on Jan. 11.


UN leader urges 'all parties to step back'


United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday urged "all parties to step back from the brink and to consider the horrendous human cost of a regional conflict."


Ryder told reporters in response to a question from VOA that the U.S. was "not at war" in the Middle East.


"Our goal here is to ensure the Red Sea is safe and secure for international shipping. That is our only goal," he added.


The Red Sea route carries about 15% of the world's maritime traffic. Major shipping companies have responded to the attacks by rerouting vessels on the longer and more expensive route around Africa.


A U.S. defense official said Monday the decline in the number and the ferocity of the Houthis' maritime attacks was directly attributed to the reduction in their capabilities.


"That does not mean they have no more capability, but we definitely believe that has had an impact," another U.S. official said.


Since mid-November, the Houthis have launched 33 attacks on international shipping lanes, according to the Pentagon. The Houthis say their attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza under attack from Israel.


Many of the Houthi attacks have targeted ships that are not associated with Israel.

## Appeals Court Rejects Trump's Bid to Reconsider Gag Order in Election Interference Case

date: 2024-01-23, from: VOA News USA

washington  — Washington's federal appeals court on Tuesday rejected Donald Trump's request to reconsider a gag order restricting the former president's speech in the case charging him with plotting to overturn the 2020 election.


Lawyers for the Republican presidential front-runner had asked the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to examine the gag order after a three-judge panel upheld but narrowed the restrictions on his speech. Trump can now appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.


An attorney for Trump did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.


The gag order was imposed by U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan in October in response to concerns from special counsel Jack Smith's team that Trump's pattern of incendiary comments could taint the proceedings, intimidate witnesses and influence jurors.


The three-judge panel that upheld the gag order last month modified it in important ways, freeing Trump to publicly criticize Smith. The special counsel has been a frequent target of Trump's ire since being appointed by the Justice Department in November 2022 to lead investigations into the former president.


The panel said that though Trump could make general comments about known or foreseeable witnesses, he could not directly attack them over their involvement in the case or about the content of their expected testimony.


Trump's lawyers argued the panel's decision contradicted Supreme Court precedent and rulings from other appeals courts. They said a fresh evaluation was needed "both to secure uniformity of this Court's decisions and because of the question's exceptional importance."


A different three-judge panel of the appeals court in Washington is separately weighing Trump's claim that he is immune from prosecution in the case, which accuses him of plotting with his Republican allies to subvert the will of voters in a bid to stay in power. Chutkan, who rejected Trump's immunity claim, has put the case on hold while he pursues his appeal.

## Ukraine Aid-Border Security Deal in Congress Likely a Week Away

date: 2024-01-23, from: VOA News USA

Capitol Hill  — U.S. lawmakers said Tuesday a deal on border security in return for Republican votes to send nearly $60 billion in aid to Ukraine is nearing completion but likely will not be announced this week.  


"The whole world is watching and asking a simple question: Does the United States stand up for its friends?" Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, one of the lead negotiators on the deal, told reporters Tuesday. "Does the United States stand up for democracy? Does the United States stand up for the preservation of the post-World War II order? Or do we turn our back on our friends, on democracy and on international norms?"   


The White House's $106 billion national security supplemental request also includes funding for border security as well as nearly $14 billion in aid to Israel and funding for Taiwan to combat the threat posed by China.  


"This is a unique opportunity where divided government has given us an opportunity to get an outcome," Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday. "Virtually all of my members have said to their constituents for a long time, 'We need to fix the border.' This administration is not going to do it unless we force him to." 


Biden asks for $60 billion


The United States has dedicated more than $100 billion to arming and supporting Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, and President Joe Biden has asked Congress to approve another $60 billion. Republicans in Congress have become increasingly skeptical about the need to continue underwriting Ukraine's defense.  


The Pentagon announced on December 27 a new $250 million security assistance package for Ukraine that included additional munitions for surface-to-air missiles systems, artillery rounds and more air defense components. The Pentagon still has $4 billion available to provide Ukraine with military aid, but no funds are available to replenish the U.S. military's stockpiles.  


"We have heard reports from the Ukrainian government, from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense and their general staff, that they are concerned, as they believe that units do not have the stocks and stores and ammunition that they require," said Celeste Wallander, assistant U.S. secretary of defense for international security affairs, on Tuesday. 


"And that is one of the reasons we have been focusing on the need to answer Congress's questions so that they are able to move forward with that decision to pass the supplemental." 


Republicans set conditions for approving aid


Republicans in the Senate have conditioned approval of any additional money for Ukraine on the simultaneous strengthening of immigration rules aimed at reducing the number of people illegally entering the United States at its southern border and expelling some who are already in the country.  


According to multiple news organizations, an estimated 300,000 people crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in December 2023. That estimate marks the highest-ever recorded number of U.S.-Mexico border crossings.    


Even if an agreement passes in the Senate, it might not survive in the House, where Republicans hold a very narrow majority. A significant group of Republican House members oppose additional aid to Ukraine, and the party in early October voted out a speaker who partnered with Democrats to pass legislation.  


Earlier this month, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson led a delegation of 60 House Republicans to visit the U.S.-Mexico border at Eagle Pass, Texas.  


"If President Biden wants a supplemental spending bill focused on national security, it better begin with defending America's national security," Johnson told reporters at a news conference on the border.  


Republicans have proposed their own legislation, H.R. 2, which would resume construction of a border wall as well as impose new restrictions on asylum-seekers.   


Carla Babb contributed to this report.

## Tribes, Environmental Groups Ask US Court to Block $10B Energy Project in Arizona

date: 2024-01-23, from: VOA News USA

ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO — A federal judge is being asked to issue a stop-work order on a $10 billion transmission line being built through a remote southeastern Arizona valley to carry wind-generated electricity to customers as far away as California. 


A 32-page lawsuit filed on January 17 in U.S. District Court in Tucson, Arizona, accuses the U.S. Interior Department and Bureau of Land Management of refusing for nearly 15 years to recognize "overwhelming evidence of the cultural significance" of the remote San Pedro Valley to Native American tribes, including the Tohono O'odham, Hopi, Zuni and San Carlos Apache Tribe. 


The suit was filed shortly after Pattern Energy received approval to transmit electricity generated by its SunZia wind farm in central New Mexico through the San Pedro Valley east of Tucson and north of Interstate 10. 


The lawsuit calls the valley "one of the most intact, prehistoric and historical ... landscapes in southern Arizona" and asks the court to issue restraining orders or permanent injunctions to halt construction. 


"The San Pedro Valley will be irreparably harmed if construction proceeds," it says. 


Government representatives declined to comment Tuesday on the pending litigation. They are expected to respond in court. The project has been touted as the biggest U.S. electricity infrastructure undertaking since the Hoover Dam. 


Pattern Energy officials said Tuesday that the time has passed to reconsider the route, which was approved in 2015 following a review process. 


"It is unfortunate and regrettable that after a lengthy consultation process, where certain parties did not participate repeatedly since 2009, this is the path chosen at this late stage," Pattern Energy spokesperson Matt Dallas said in an email. 


Plaintiffs in the lawsuit are the Tohono O'odham Nation, the San Carlos Apache Tribe and the nonprofit organizations Center for Biological Diversity and Archaeology Southwest. 


"The case for protecting this landscape is clear," Archaeology Southwest said in a statement that calls the San Pedro Arizona's last free-flowing river and the valley the embodiment of a "unique and timely story of social and ecological sustainability across more than 12,000 years of cultural and environmental change." 


The valley represents an 80-kilometer (50-mile) stretch of the planned 885-kilometer (550-mile) conduit expected to carry electricity from new wind farms in central New Mexico to existing transmission lines in Arizona to serve populated areas as far away as California. The project has been called an important part of President Joe Biden's goal for a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035. 


Work started in September in New Mexico after negotiations that spanned years and resulted in approval from the Bureau of Land Management, the federal agency with authority over vast parts of the U.S. West. 


The route in New Mexico was modified after the U.S. Defense Department raised concerns about the effects of high-voltage lines on radar systems and military training operations. 


Work halted briefly in November amid pleas by tribes to review environmental approvals for the San Pedro Valley and resumed weeks later in what Tohono O'odham Chairman Verlon M. Jose characterized as "a punch to the gut." 


SunZia expects the transmission line to begin commercial service in 2026, carrying more than 3,500 megawatts of wind power to 3 million people. Project officials say they conducted surveys and worked with tribes over the years to identify cultural resources in the area. 


A photo included in the court filing shows an aerial view in November of ridgetop access roads and tower sites being built west of the San Pedro River near Redrock Canyon. Tribal officials and environmentalists say the region is otherwise relatively untouched. 


The transmission line also is being challenged before the Arizona Court of Appeals. The court is being asked to consider whether state regulatory officials there properly considered the benefits and consequences of the project.

## Donald Trump's Defamation Trial to Resume Thursday

date: 2024-01-23, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Donald Trump's trial in the defamation case brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll will resume on Thursday and will not be held on Wednesday as initially scheduled, Manhattan federal court records showed Tuesday. 


The trial's second postponement this week delays a potential face-to-face encounter between Carroll and the former U.S. president, who has said he wants to testify. 


On Monday, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan delayed the trial until Wednesday after a juror and one of Trump's lawyers reported illnesses. 


When the trial resumes, jurors will determine how much Trump should pay Carroll for defaming her in June 2019, when he denied raping her in the mid-1990s in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in Manhattan. 


Trump, the front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, has consistently denied that anything happened and accused Carroll of making up the incident to boost sales of her then-new memoir.

## Charles Osgood, CBS Host on TV, Radio and 'Poet-in-Residence,' Dies at 91

date: 2024-01-23, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Charles Osgood, a five-time Emmy Award-winning journalist who anchored "CBS Sunday Morning" for more than two decades, hosted the long-running radio program "The Osgood File" and was referred to as CBS News' poet-in-residence, has died. He was 91. 


CBS reported that Osgood died Tuesday at his home in Saddle River, New Jersey, and that the cause was dementia, according to his family. 


Osgood was an erudite, warm broadcaster with a flair for music who could write essays and light verse as well as report hard news. He worked in radio and television with equal facility and signed off by telling listeners: "I'll see you on the radio." 


"To say there's no one like Charles Osgood is an understatement," Rand Morrison, executive producer of "Sunday Morning," said in a statement. "He embodied the heart and soul of 'Sunday Morning.' ... At the piano, Charlie put our lives to music. Truly, he was one of a kind — in every sense." 




"CBS News Sunday Morning" will honor Osgood with a special broadcast on Sunday. 


Osgood took over "Sunday Morning" after the beloved Charles Kuralt retired in 1994. Osgood seemingly had an impossible act to follow, but with his folksy erudition and his slightly bookish, bow-tied style, he immediately clicked with viewers, who continued to embrace the program as an unhurried TV magazine. 


Osgood, who graduated from Fordham University in 1954, started as a classical music disk jockey in Washington, served in the Army and returned to help start WHCT in Hartford, Connecticut. In 1963, he got an on-air position at ABC Radio in New York. 


In 1967, he took a job as reporter on the CBS-owned New York news radio station NewsRadio 88. Then, one fateful weekend, he was summoned to fill in at the anchor desk for the TV network's Saturday newscast. In 1971, he joined the CBS network and launched what would be known as "The Osgood File." 


In 1990, he was inducted into the radio division of the National Association of Broadcaster's Hall of Fame. In 2008, he was awarded the National Association of Broadcasters Distinguished Service Award. He won four Emmy Awards and earned a fifth lifetime achievement honor in 2017. 


Jane Pauley succeeded Osgood as host of "Sunday Morning," becoming only the third host of the program. 


When he retired in 2016 after 45 years of journalism, Osgood did so in a very Osgood fashion. 


"For years now, people — even friends and family — have been asking me why I continue doing this, considering my age," the then-83-year-old Osgood said in brief concluding remarks. "It's just that it's been such a joy doing it! It's been a great run, but after nearly 50 years at CBS ... the time has come." 


And then he sang a few wistful bars from a favorite folk song: "So long, it's been good to know you. I've got to be drifting along."

## The time to unmaintainable is very low

date: 2024-01-23, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>It’s so easy nowadays to get up and going on a project. I can burp some <code>npm</code> commands into my terminal, burp some more to setup a deployment pipeline and blam! Website. The time to product demo is so low. You can get far on your own… very quickly… but then… you’re on your own. And it’s possible you’ve built something way past your ability to maintain.</p>
<p>To fix that problem or to allow you to do more business’y work, you add people to the process. But people cost lots of money. Unless what you’re building makes lots of money already, you probably have to raise VC. With a squad of developers burping <code>npm</code> commands, now you’re moving super fast. Hopefully money starts coming in, but the whole point of investment was so you could price the application artificially cheap to grow a user base that you upsell later. As the investment coffers tick down, the pressure goes up to land a new feature or gimmick so you can get another round of investment.</p>
<p>You can, of course, ride the hype cycles. This year that’s AI. Investors might throw money at that. But now you’ve bolted on a feature from a highly volatile, emergent, non-deterministic space into your overgrown application. You’ll either need to hire more expensive people who know the space or divert existing resources who were performing maintenance over to the new feature.</p>
<p>Oops, AI costs more than you can charge for it. You burned through the investment even faster and must do a round of layoffs. Now your app maintained by 10 people has 8 people… then 5… then 2…</p>
<p>Paying people to burp <code>npm</code> commands is expensive, could AI do that? Vercel’s <a href="https://v0.dev/">v0</a>, for example, farts out entire UIs. Great. In a day I have twelve thousand screens built. I have more UI than some developers will code in a lifetime. But I’m getting the itch to update it and the machine isn’t doing what I want it to… perhaps I’ll take some VC to hire some people to clean up these robo-farts.</p>
<p>And by the time you finish all that work, it’ll be right in time for a major version update on a core dependency. Good luck out there.</p>
<p>I realize I’m complaining about moving too fast but that’s not my intent. Although, I could argue that while driving 200mph is fun and exciting, you’re one small fuckup away from a major fuckup. My point is that a key factor of sustainability is making sure maintainability stays on par with growth. At the risk of sounding like a Luddite – <a href="https://amzn.to/3NA62WE">which I am</a> – the ability to <em style="font-family: fantasy;">fancy copy-paste</em> your way into an unmaintainable situation is higher than ever and that’s a trade-off we should think about.</p>

## United Questions Future Boeing 737 Orders After Groundings

date: 2024-01-23, from: VOA News USA

New York — United Airlines cast doubt Tuesday on future orders and deliveries of Boeing 737s after it was forced to ground dozens of planes following the dramatic Alaska Airlines incident earlier this month.


The U.S. airline grounded its fleet of 79 Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft on January 6, a day after a panel blew off the Alaska Airlines plane mid-flight, leaving a hole in the fuselage and forcing an emergency landing.


Although there were no fatalities or serious injuries in the January 5 incident, U.S. regulators grounded 171 jets from the 737 Max 9 fleet with the same configuration as the plane involved in that drama.


United announced Monday that it predicts the aircraft will remain out of action through the end of January, leading to losses in the first quarter of 2024.


In a conference call Tuesday, United's chief financial officer Michael Leskinen said 31 out of the 107 aircraft United expects to take delivery of this year are Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft.


"It is unrealistic at this time to believe all of those aircraft will deliver as currently planned," he said.


Alongside its Max 9 orders, United also has 277 as-yet-uncertified Boeing 737 Max 10 aircraft on order through the rest of the 2020s, and options to purchase 200 further aircraft, Leskinen told the conference call.


"We also expect a reduction in orders and deliveries from Boeing in 2025," he said, noting that orders of 737 Max 10s would also likely be affected.


The Max grounding was "kind of straw that broke the camel's back with believing that the Max 10 will deliver on the schedule we had hoped for," he said.


"So we are working through an alternate plan," he added. 


United's shares were up almost seven percent in mid-day trading, following the release of strong fourth-quarter results after the market closed Monday, while Boeing's shares slipped by around 0.7 percent.

## One big, one little

date: 2024-01-23, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>I often feel overwhelmed deciding what to do with my spare time. It’s a problem with volume moreso than ambition. When the feeling hit the other weekend I scribbled down seven ideas <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/02/bag-of-distractions/">rattling around in my head</a> and stared at the list blankly. I’ve used different prioritization systems in the past like the Eisenhower matrix (Urgent vs. Important) and the Six Sigma matrix (Effort vs Impact); and while those are good for evaluating required tasks… none of those work well for voluntary activities self-created by a <a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/01/not-a-collector/">serial project starter</a>.</p>
<p>I need a system that helps prioritize <em>and</em> load balance projects I give myself. When free time shows up, I don’t want to waste time doomscrolling on social media or being in a state of overwhelm, I want to hop right in to an idea. I also don’t want seven big thought benders occupying my brain RAM at all times, I need less background noise. After some thought, a tiny mantra started kicking around in my head, “One big, one little.”</p>
<p>If I artificially limit myself to having one major and one minor active side project at a time, my agility goes up because I’m not doing ten projects at once, I’m doing one or two. When one <a href="https://daverupert.com/2022/04/productivity-sniped-by-para/">project finishes</a>, I move to the next best idea that fits the available slot. I will never be taking on too much and it’s easier to say “no” to new distractions if I have to substitute projects.</p>
<p>Why two projects? Why not one? That would be the ultimate focus state, but believe it or not it’s an intentional move because my pockets of free time are differently sized. In my mind, a big project takes a week or a month while a little project takes a day or less. You can slice up big projects into smaller projects, but that itself is a small planning project. I also like variety.</p>
<p>And because I have more than two responsibilities in life, one slight modification to this system might be to have one big, one little project for each major area of my life.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Area</th>
<th>Big</th>
<th>Little</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Work</td>
<td>Learn algorithms</td>
<td>Write a blog post</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Personal</td>
<td>Make a game</td>
<td>Build a Gundam</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Family</td>
<td>Clean garage</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Careful! Adding more areas will put me back where I started, but 3 to 5 areas seems about right. What’s different between this list and the list of seven ideas I made the other day? Not much except that areas of my life tend to occupy particular timeframes: Work is during the day, Personal is during the evenings, and Family is after school and weekends. In practice my boundaries overlap (e.g. my work feeds my family) but it’s pretty easy for me to discern which area of my life needs attention.</p>
<p>I like how this limited structure builds some resilience against “crash-ins” like urgent emails, taxes, or car problems. Those surprise projects tend to be disproportionately problematic for me, like delivering a new piece of furniture to an already crowded living room. If I’m abiding in the one-in/one-out approach, a crash-in must take the place of something else in that respective area. That paradigm is much easier to manage than my current thought technology; a giant Jenga tower of obligations.</p>
<p>No idea if this holds up but this past week I’ve been more focused and centered than ever. Yesterday I cleared out a big work-related project and freed up some mental allocation. Wiping a project off the board and seeing a blank space made finishing the project even sweeter. Then last night I had some extra energy after bedtime and decided to work on a fun project for my podcast. I got about 80% finished in one night. Before (like the last four weeks) I would have felt guilty or distracted about picking up that project while thinking about four others I could/should be doing.</p>
<p>That’s my new “One big, one little” system. Now when a rogue idea sneaks into my periphery, I can chant my mantra and ward away those little demons.</p>

## It’s 2030. Where Will U.S. Carbon Emissions Come From?

date: 2024-01-23, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTE1MDM1MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyNjYxNDkyOH0.aPVaDweu3zd2k_a7oecTfW7SLnO83Ua6kAHRZH1j9v0/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	The year is 2030.
</p><p>
	For much of the past decade, the United States has taken aggressive action to fight climate change. After passing the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, the Biden administration regulated carbon pollution from 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/epa-power-plants-supreme-court" target="_self">power plants</a> and <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/epa-car-emissions-evs-takeaways" target="_self">cars and trucks</a>. (Let’s also stipulate, for the sake of argument, that it kept the rules in place by winning re-election in 2024.) Progressive states such as California, New York, and Illinois responded by passing even tougher climate laws of their own. And now, at the end of the decade, America has a good shot of hitting its Paris Agreement goal of cutting emissions in half as compared to their all-time high.
</p><p>
	Here’s the question: In this rosy scenario, where will America’s remaining greenhouse gas emissions come from? What should climate policy focus on 
	<em>next</em>?
</p><p>
	That’s the subject of 
	<a href="https://rhg.com/research/pathways-to-net-zero-us-emissions-beyond-2030" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a fascinating new report</a> from the Rhodium Group, a nonpartisan research firm. The study, published today, offers a glimpse at what climate hawks might be focusing on next decade (if they’re lucky). It’s meant to begin a yearslong conversation over what the next climate law — the Inflation Reduction Act of 2032, in other words — might look like.
</p><p>
	Perhaps surprisingly, it finds that a handful of economic activities will dominate the country’s emissions. Just 11 industries or types of polluting sources will generate more than 80% of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2030, the study finds. And just 
	three of these will emit nearly half of the country’s total pollution. If we can decarbonize those activities, then a net-zero U.S. economy will be in sight.
</p><center><iframe aria-label="Range Plot" data-external="1" frameborder="0" height="538" id="datawrapper-chart-WvKOV" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WvKOV/1/" style="border: none;" title="The 11 Climate-Polluting Activities You’ll Meet in 2030" width="680">
</iframe></center><p>
	But those 11 activities will be tough to crack. They fall into a few categories:
</p><ul>
<li>About 19% of the remaining emissions will come from parts of the fossil-fuel economy directly involved in storing, moving, or transforming oil or natural gas into other products. Pipelines, refineries, and chemical plants all require the on-site combustion of fossil fuels, and while the Environmental Protection Act <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/biden-epa-methane-rules" target="_self">is cracking down on methane leaks</a> from those facilities, carbon dioxide will keep flowing from them.</li>
<br/>
<li>Another 12% of the remaining emissions will come from some of the tougher problems in transportation: heavy-duty freight trucking and aviation. The latter problem will be particularly tough. Rhodium projects that domestic aviation, which is responsible for about 2% of the country’s carbon pollution today, will rise to 4% of national emissions by the end of the decade. Americans fly more today than they did in 2005, and fuel-efficiency improvements are not keeping up with that increasing demand.</li>
<br/>
<li>Farms will fill out another 10% of leftover emissions. About half of those emissions will come from fermentation of plant matter in the guts of plants and animals — the infamous <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/33/which-is-a-bigger-methane-source-cow-belching-or-cow-flatulence/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cow burps</a>. But the other half will arise from the interaction of soils, microbes, and fertilizer. When fertilizer is applied to soil, bacteria convert its nitrogen into <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2020/10/07/laughing-gas-growing-climate-problem/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nitrous oxide</a>, a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide on a 100-year time scale. This process will generate 6% of America’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, according to the study.</li>
</ul><p>
	By far the most important category of emissions are what you might think of as the “Big Three,” which together will account for nearly half of 2030 emissions. They are cars, trucks, and SUVs; furnaces and water heaters in buildings; and power plants, and they will dominate the country’s emissions in 2030 as much as they dominate them today.
</p><p>
	The “Big Three” are also the focus of powerful climate policies already, and Rhodium’s analysts expect those policies to be effective. “We’re pushing on them a lot, and they’re coming down. But they remain the top three,” 
	<a href="https://rhg.com/team/hannah-kolus/" target="_blank">Hannah Kolus</a>, a senior analyst at Rhodium and an author of the report, told me. Carbon pollution from light-duty vehicles, for instance, will fall 32% from its 2005 level by 2030, the report projects.
</p><p>
	But cars, building furnaces, and power plants take so long to turn over that even supremely effective policy will take decades to zero out emissions. The 
	<em>average</em> car on the road in America right now is 12 years old. Even if electrics made up 100% of all new car sales by 2030 — which, under Rhodium’s projection, they won’t — it might take 20 years for them to totally replace the vehicle fleet. In other words, <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/state-traffic-emissions-bil-targets" target="_self">climate hawks</a> will be thinking about cars and trucks, building furnaces, and power plants for a long time.

## Carbon Offsets From Clean Cookstoves Are Kind of Bogus, Too

date: 2024-01-23, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTE1MDU3Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNTE2MDIwNX0.F9AK6uxlARgIimw_uwDbdw1F2fHsW6R2gxbQIl_S82o/image.jpg?width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C125"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">A new study casts doubt on the integrity of yet another type of carbon offset.</p><p>Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, investigated clean cookstove projects, in which companies distribute stoves that require less or cleaner types of fuel to people who cannot afford them and sell carbon credits based on the resulting emission reductions. These projects have generated, on average, nine times more carbon credits than they should have based on their climate benefits, the researchers found. </p><p>This kind of credit inflation obscures climate progress, as the individuals and businesses who buy these credits do so to justify their own emissions under the belief that they are funding climate action elsewhere.</p><p>It also threatens a key source of funding to remedy a major public health problem. Nearly a third of the global population — some 2.3 billion people — cook with wood and charcoal burned on open fires or in very basic stoves that expose people to dangerous levels of pollution, including particulate matter and carbon monoxide. The smoke contributes to respiratory and cardiovascular problems and leads to an estimated 4 million premature deaths every year. On top of that, this form of cooking releases roughly 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions. </p><p>Companies have jumped at the opportunity to finance solutions by selling carbon offsets, with great success. Between 2017 and 2022, the volume of finance secured for clean cookstoves through the carbon market increased 45-fold, according to a <a href="https://cleancooking.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CCA_A-Call-to-Action_Delivering-Responsible-Carbon-Finance.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report by the Clean Cookstove Alliance</a> published last fall. Now, cookstove projects make up some 10% of all credits on the carbon market. And they’re one of the fastest growing types of offset projects.</p><p>The new <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-023-01259-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a>, published in the peer-reviewed journal <em>Nature Sustainability</em> on Wednesday, finds that the methods developers are using to measure the amount of carbon these projects avoid are deeply flawed.</p><p>The first red flag the researchers identified was that academic studies of clean cookstoves report much lower adoption rates (whether the new stove was used) and usage rates (how often the new stove was used) than offset projects do. A representative sample of offset projects reported an 86% adoption rate and 98% usage rate, whereas the research literature reported a 58% adoption rate and 52% usage rate.</p><p>“The literature at large has found, honestly, devastatingly low rates of adoption and usage,” Annelise Gill-Wiehl, a PhD student at Berkeley and the lead author of the study told me. Some families totally abandon their new stoves, while others continue to use traditional cooking methods in addition to the clean stove. That’s because the new stoves might have smaller burners, not get as hot, change the taste of traditional foods, or else just create more work for cooks. “The first thing you have to ask yourself is, have these offset projects just solved it?” Gill-Wiehl said. “Or are there limitations in their methods?”</p><p>One big limitation, according to Gill-Wiehl and her coauthors, is the way offset data is collected. To measure adoption, many project managers use a simple one-time survey that asks households if they used the new stove in the last week or month. If they reply yes, the developer will generate credits as if the household used the stove 100% of the time. Not only is this not exactly robust methodologically, but it may also result in participants inflating their usage to please the survey collectors — a common effect known as “social desirability bias.”</p><p>Another major issue stems from the way these projects account for larger environmental impacts. One of the key ways clean cookstove initiatives cut emissions is by reducing the degradation of forests that results from the gathering of fuel to make fires. It would be impossible to measure these cuts directly, but the default estimates that project developers use vastly overstate the level of degradation that would otherwise occur compared to what the peer-reviewed literature has found.</p><p>But like anything offsets-related, this study, too, has attracted fierce scrutiny. After an earlier version of it was published a year ago, offset project developers <a href="https://cquestcapital.com/latest/news-and-blogs/open-letter-experts-challenge-misguided-criticism-of-clean-cookstoves-funding/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">responded</a> with an open letter calling it “misguided.” For instance, the letter calls it inappropriate to compare carbon offset projects to non-commercial projects analyzed in the academic literature. It also accuses the Berkeley researchers of selectively choosing studies and carbon offset projects to include. Finally, the letter also points to the fact that the Better Cooking Company, a cookstove company that is trying to sell credits, provided funding for the study and asserts that the findings benefit that company.</p><p>Gill-Wiehl pushed back on all points. The Better Cookstove Company provided 10% of the funding, she said, and had no influence over the findings. She added that the results don’t benefit the company — the study implies that it, too, is guilty of over-crediting, primarily due to inflated forest conservation estimates. </p><p>“We did not write this to burn cookstoves to the ground,” she told me. “This is an incredibly important project type, and it’s so incredibly important that it can't be based on a house of cards.”</p><p>Gill-Wiehl said she and her co-authors want the carbon market registries — the groups that design the methodologies project developers must follow to generate and sell credits — to adopt stronger rules that improve the integrity of the market. For example, to measure usage, they could require developers to collect metered data from the stoves or to use fuel sales data. They also want the registries to require that developers use more accurate estimates from the literature for forest degradation. Without significant change, buyers could lose confidence and funding could dry up.</p><p>Some of the issues with clean cookstove projects were already known, if not quantified to the extent in this new paper, and there are some ongoing efforts in the industry to improve them. An influential United Nations body <a href="https://cleancooking.org/news/unfccc-posts-fnrb-update-research-for-public-comment/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recently supported research</a> to establish more accurate estimates of forest degradation, and a <a href="https://cleancooking.org/cca-led-clean-cooking-climate-consortium-makes-significant-progress-in-developing-clean-cooking-carbon-methodology" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">consortium of government groups and NGOs</a> is working to develop stronger rules for crediting cookstove projects. </p><p>The authors of the study hope this increased attention on cookstoves doesn’t just lead to more legitimate offset projects, but also to ones that better prioritize public health. The vast majority of the cookstoves handed out for offset projects are designed to run more efficiently, but still expose users to dangerous levels of pollution. As of November 2022, only 4% of projects provided the types of stoves that the <a href="https://www.who.int/tools/clean-household-energy-solutions-toolkit/module-7-defining-clean" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World Health Organization deems</a> “clean for health at point of use.”</p><p>“I feel like at this moment when there’s a shake up of the offset market in general — but also, right now around cookstoves — we have an opportunity to direct all of this finance to projects that have a transformative benefit to people’s lives and health,” Barbara Haya, director of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project and one of the study’s authors, told me. “And we have an obligation to do that if we’re going to use those credits to make claims of reducing emissions.”</p>

## US Defense Secretary Makes First Public Appearance, Virtually, Since Hospitalization

date: 2024-01-23, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Tuesday made his first public appearance, virtually and from home, since his secret hospitalization, during a meeting on Ukraine's military needs. 


He skipped over prepared remarks that would have addressed his health.  


Austin, 70, was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland on December 22 to treat prostate cancer. He returned to the hospital on January 1 due to complications, including a urinary tract infection. His hospitalization was not revealed until four days later, and the Pentagon did not specify why he was being treated until January 9. 


Austin's failure to tell President Joe Biden he was hospitalized drew criticism from lawmakers and caught the White House by surprise. 


Austin appeared on the livestream for a few minutes as he made his opening remarks. He was sitting in front of a white wall with what appeared to be a security system keypad on his left and a Department of Defense seal on the right, with small U.S. and Ukrainian flags on top of a printer next to it.  


While there was a slight break in the livestream, Austin did not address his health, even though the topic was in his prepared remarks. 


He is not expected to take part in a joint press conference with the top U.S. general after the meeting, something that has become routine after such gatherings.

## When did Raspberry Pi get so expensive?

date: 2024-01-23, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">When did Raspberry Pi get so expensive?</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><img width="700" height="auto" class="insert-image" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/gmktec-n100-pc-raspberry-pi-5.jpeg" alt="Raspberry Pi 5 and N100 GMKtec Nucbox G3" /></p>

<p>I just bought this N100-based Intel x86 mini PC (<em>brand new</em>), and it was cheaper than an almost equivalent—but slower—Raspberry Pi 5.</p>

<p>This GMKtec mini PC is called the <a href="https://amzn.to/4b88MVp">Nucbox G3</a>, and it comes with an Intel Alder Lake N100 4-core CPU, 8GB of RAM, a 256 GB M.2 NVMe SSD, and Windows 11 Pro—and mine cost just $131, after a couple coupons.</p>

<p>That's... a lot of computer for a very good price. But the Raspberry Pi—the famous "$35 computer", should be well below that... right?</p>

<p>Well, I bought all the parts required to build a Pi 5 to the same spec—including the adapters and parts to assemble it into one small unit—and it turns out... the Pi is <em>more expensive</em>. And <em>slower</em>.</p>

<p>The Pi 4 still starts at $35 (for a 1 GB model), but the Pi 5 starts at $60 (for 4 GB) and climbs to $80 for the maximum 8 GB model.</p></div>

## How to get started with Advanced Squad Leader

date: 2024-01-23, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>How to get started with Advanced Squad Leader</h1>

<p>The PDF for Advanced Squad Leader (ASL) rules has 714 pages. How do you even get started?</p>

<p>There are four <a href="https://mmpgamers.com/asl-starter-kit-c-2_8">starter kits</a> (SK):</p>

<ol>
<li>Regular infantry</li>
<li>Guns</li>
<li>Tanks</li>
<li>Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO)</li>
</ol>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to take that route and tried to dive straight in but this is not how it works. Start small.</p>

<p>You can get the <a href="https://mmpgamers.com/support/aslsk/ASLSK4_Rules_September_2021.pdf">rules for all four starter kits</a> as a PDF.</p>

<p>Buy <a href="https://www.wargamevault.com/product/344879/Electronic-Advanced-Squad-Leader-Rulebook">the complete rules</a> once you know that you like the game.</p>

<p>As somebody recently told me: &ldquo;Looking up the rules is 90% of the game!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I like to call Advanced Squad Leader &ldquo;the game to end all rules-lawyering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For online gaming, you need to download the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://vassalengine.org/">VASSAL</a>. Vassal is a game engine for building and playing online adaptations of board games and card games. Vassal is free, open-source software.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://vasl.info/">VASL</a>. VASL is the module you need to run ASL on VASSAL.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The VASL site has a section called &ldquo;Download Scenarios&rdquo; where you can download setups for many scenarios (without the mission goals). If you load those games, you&rsquo;ll see messages about all the extensions you&rsquo;re missing. Often you don&rsquo;t need them, but feel free to install them.</p>

<p>If you want a physical box of the games, with physical counters, be aware that you must buy <em>Beyond Valor</em> because it has some stuff that gets used in later boxes.</p>

<p>(Earlier: <a href="2022-11-05_Advanced_Squad_Leader">Advanced Squad Leader</a>, 2022.)</p>

Here's what I wrote <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/01/24/30thAnniversaryOfMac.html">ten years ago</a> on the 30th anniversary of the Mac. "The rollout on January 24th was like a college graduation ceremony." It appears I didn't write anything about the Mac anniversary <a href="http://scripting.com/2004/01.html">in 2004</a> and my blog didn't exist on 1/24/94. But I did write a piece on what made the Mac different on the <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/01/24/whatMadeTheMacDifferent.html">25th anniversary</a> in 2009. BTW, the comments on that piece are incredible. Click the <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/01/24/whatMadeTheMacDifferent.html">link</a> just to read the freaking comments.

It was a huge day in my life, and in the evolution of personal computers and ultimately, the internet. I was there that day, along with Kandes Bregman from my startup, Living Videotext.

We were extremely excited, the Mac seemed to be the perfect machine for our "idea processor" ThinkTank, and Apple seemed to love us. It took a couple of years to get it right, by 1986 my company had switched to be an exclusively Mac company, but not before we were saved by the people at Apple who believed in us, notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Kawasaki">Guy Kawasaki</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Boich">Mike Boich</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_Yocam">Del Yocam</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Campbell_(business_executive)">Bill Campbell</a>, and many others. I don't know if we would have made it without the help of Apple, but luckily we didn't have to find out. Thank you to all our friends at Apple, and to Steve Jobs and the Mac team for creating such a wonderful breakthrough product. Those were the days when we believed we were on a mission to save the world. In some sense that idea has never left, to our generation of entrepreneurial software developers.

<strong></strong>San Diego’s mayor declared a state of emergency Monday after the city experienced its wettest January day on record.

2. Reviewers give thumbs up to Kia EV9’s novel third row

	First-drive reviews are trickling in for Kia’s EV9, “an all-electric SUV with three rows that many believe will bring a whole new batch of EV customers into the market,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=5e448d3f08&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Kirsten Korosec at <em>TechCrunch</em>. It’s super quiet, feels nice on the road, and looks incredibly cool. But what about that third row? The consensus seems to be: It’s nice to have, but it could be bigger.

3. VP Harris touts Biden's $1 trillion in climate spending
</h3><p>
<strong></strong>The Biden administration wants to drum up enthusiasm about its climate track record ahead of Election Day 2024, and it seems to have landed on an unusual strategy: Boast about how much money it has spent. Vice President Kamala Harris has been telling crowds that she and Biden have invested $1 trillion in climate initiatives. The figure “doesn’t align with one of the chief metrics observers have used to measure the administration’s climate agenda: $369 billion,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d2cc8d4224&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> <em>E&E News</em>. So where did it come from? Simple arithmetic, the White House said. “She is referencing all of the clean energy, resilience, environmental justice, and innovation funding that is part of our historic effort to address the climate crisis, increase resilience, advance environmental justice, and build a clean energy economy,” a White House spokesperson told <em>E&E News</em>. While right-wing critics say the spending has been excessive, the administration is hoping it will show climate-oriented voters that Biden cares, and motivate them to vote.

4. Report: Benefits of storing carbon in soil ‘too good to be true<strong>’</strong></h3><p>
<strong></strong>The carbon sequestration benefits of regenerative farming have been overexaggerated, reports <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=80c93428e8&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">the<em> Financial Times</em></a>, as agribusiness giants look for new ways to offset their emissions. Regenerative agriculture aims to improve soil quality by avoiding pesticides and fertilizers, planting cover crops, and leaving fields untilled. Healthier soil can store more carbon, which is why big polluters in food production are committing money and land to regenerative practices. But the soil sequestration movement is undermined by murky measurements and a lack of clear guidelines and definitions from the agrifood industry: Just 18 of the 50 projects using regenerative agriculture offered quantitative targets, the <em>FT</em> reported. Industries seem to be ignoring the fact that soil can only hold so much carbon before emissions rise again, and that carbon stored in soil isn’t trapped forever.

5. Scientists are worried about missing Arctic climate data from Russia 
</h3><p>
<strong></strong>A lack of scientific data out of Russia is limiting our understanding of how climate change is altering the Arctic, according to a <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=13c591e6ca&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new study</a> published in <em>Nature Climate Change</em>. Nearly half of the Arctic’s landmass is located in Russia, and after the invasion of Ukraine, Moscow stopped sharing data from its Arctic monitoring stations. “This has potentially global consequences for important processes such as permafrost thawing, shifts in biodiversity, or even greenhouse gas emissions,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=b966da047e&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> the study’s lead author Efren Lopez-Blanco. The Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the planet, and monitoring what happens in the region can help researchers predict how global warming will affect the globe.

## Pluralistic: Dave Maass and Patrick Lay's "Death Strikes: The Emperor of Atlantis" (23 January 2024)

date: 2024-01-23, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links Dave Maass and Patrick Lay's "Death Strikes: The Emperor of Atlantis": A graphic novel based on a musical written by inmates at a Nazi death-camp. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Dave Maass and Patrick Lay's "Death Strikes: The Emperor of Atlantis" (permalink) "The Emperor of Atlantis," is an opera written by two Nazi concentration camp inmates, the librettist Peter Kien and the composer Viktor Ullmann, while they were interned in Terezin, a show-camp in Czechoslovakia that housed numerous Jewish artists, who were encouraged to make and display their work as a way of proving to the rest of the world that Nazi camps were humane places. Of course, it was all a sham. Like nearly all of Terezin's inmates, Kein and Ullmann were eventually shipped to Auschwitz to be murdered. "The Emperor" was never performed during their life, but the manuscript, written on scrounged paper (including the backs of other inmates Auschwitz transfer papers) survived. In the decades since, "The Emperor" has been mounted a few times, with varying degrees of faithfulness. But those live performances were limited to the people who could attend them during their limited run. Now, a new graphic novel called Death Strikes: The Emperor of Atlantis, brings the work to us all: https://www.darkhorse.com/Blog/3726/berger-books-and-dark-horse-comics-present-death-s Death Strikes was adapted by my EFF colleague Dave Maass, an investigator and muckraker and brilliant writer, who teamed up with illustrator Patrick Lay and character designer Ezra Rose (who worked from the Kein and Ullmann's original designs, which survived along with the score and libretto). The tale is set in the mythical kingdom of Atlantis, where the reclusive emperor has been holed up in an armored tower for decades, directing a forever war, greeting each battlefield report with fresh orders, all the while carefully scheming to maintain his grip on power by prolonging the war footing among his people. But the Emperor has a problem: he's won the war. Every enemy has fallen. Without endless war, his system of social control will shrivel and he will be vulnerable to his people. So the Emperor declares a new war of all against all, announcing that it is every citizen's duty to make war on their neighbors. Problem solved! But the Emperor goes too far. In announcing his new war, he directs his messengers &#8211; drum-beating automata who march through the streets of Atlantic rapping out his edicts &#8211; to claim that Death himself has blessed this new war, and "when the final drum sounds, our old friend DEATH, our flag-bearer, will raise his sword in salute to our great future!" For Death &#8211; a swordbearing skeleton in a soldier's greatcoat and shako &#8211; this is too much. The Emperor's endless wars have already tried Death's patience. Death brings mercy, not vengeance, and the endless killing has dismayed him. The Emperor's co-option drives him past the brink, and Death declares a strike, breaking his sword and announcing that henceforth, no one will die. Needless to say, this puts a crimp in the Emperor's all-out war plan. People get shot and stabbed and drowned and poisoned, but they don't die. They just hang around, embarrassingly alive (there's a great comic subplot of the inability of the Emperor's executioners to kill a captured assassin). The Emperor will not be denied. He embarks upon a war of wills with Death, to see who will give in first. The surreal tale plays out among the people of Atlantis, the living and the undead, as they struggle to fight a war where no one can die. The tale cuts between these people, the Emperor, and Death, who is in company with Life, a sad harlequin who is even more demoralized than Death by the Emperor's long war. What follows is a tale of revolution and love and hope snatched from despair. Maass discovered "The Emperor" through a bargain bin CD of "degenerate music" he found in a suburban Best Buy in the 1990s, which was accompanied by illustrations by Art Spiegelman: https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-music-survives%21-degenerate-music-music-suppressed-by-the-third-reich-mw0000711660 Maass found a six-panel cartoon Kein drew "expressing his frustration with the evolution of his libretto." Over the years, Maass turned this little strip over and over in his head, until he found himself travelling to Prague with Ley, where they were able to handle the surviving manuscript pages. After consulting with experts all over the world, Maass and Lay and their collaborators created this extraordinary graphic novel, updating it, queering it, and lavishly illustrating it. While this is clearly an adaptation, Kein and Ullmann's spirit of creativity, courage, and bittersweet creative foment shines through. It's a beautiful book, snatched from death itself.

## Blinken Expresses US Commitment to Boosting Africa Partnerships

date: 2024-01-23, from: VOA News USA

State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday the United States is committed to growing its partnerships across the African continent and increasingly sees African countries “leading on issues of global consequence.”


Speaking to reporters alongside Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara after talks in Abidjan, Blinken said the discussion included growing commercial ties to create jobs and growth in both the U.S. and Ivory Coast, as well as investing in public health initiatives and addressing regional security challenges.


Blinken said the United States and Ivory Coast “have a strong and growing bond.”


Blinken’s visit to Ivory Coast is seen as reflecting U.S. interests in the country’s stability and its preparations for the 2025 presidential election.




The U.S. and international community are concerned about stability in the Sahel sub-region of West Africa following several coups in Mali, Burkina Faso, Guinea and Niger since 2020.


Ivory Coast borders three countries that have experienced coups in recent years: Guinea in September 2021; Mali in both August 2020 and May 2021; and Burkina Faso in January and September of 2022.


The United States announced $45 million in new funding to aid Ivory Coast and its neighbors in preventing conflict and promoting stability amid regional threats. This contribution brings the total U.S. stability-focused assistance in Coastal West Africa to nearly $300 million since 2022.


From Ivory Coast, Blinken is traveling Tuesday to Nigeria where he is set to hold talks with Nigerian President Bola Tinubu and Foreign Minister Yusuf Maitama Tuggar in Abuja.


Regional security talks in Nigeria


Nigeria shares a border with Niger, where the military ousted its elected leader, Mohamed Bazoum, on July 26, 2023, and subsequently scrapped defense agreements with France, its traditional security partner.


In Abuja, Blinken is anticipated to discuss the military coup in Niger. The meeting comes just days after the country's military junta agreed to enhance relations with Russia.




American officials have stated that while the U.S. is open to countries diversifying their partnerships, aligning with nations like Russia could be problematic. They point to the situation in Mali, where rising civilian casualties and security issues have followed Russian paramilitary Wagner Group's involvement and France's withdrawal.


The French military withdrawal from the Sahel and the end of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali in December have heightened concerns over regional security.




Nigeria is the largest country by population and economy in sub-Saharan Africa, and the dominant political, economic, and military power in the Economic Community of West African States, or ECOWAS.


The United States is the largest foreign investor in Nigeria, and the U.S. maintains a significant security partnership with Nigeria in its counterterrorism operations against both Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa.


Cabo Verde


Blinken’s fourth African trip began Monday in Cape Verde and is scheduled to close in Angola. State Department officials said key priorities included bolstering security partnerships and enhancing health and economic development in the region.




In Cape Verde's capital, Praia, Blinken held talks Monday with Prime Minister Ulisses Correia e Silva and visited the city’s port, Porto da Praia, which received funding for modernization efforts from the U.S. government’s Millennium Challenge Corporation.


“It is extraordinary that Cabo Verde is the first country to complete two Millennium Challenge Corporation compacts, and now you’re starting to build a third one,” said Blinken.


He also congratulated Cabo Verde’s malaria-free certification by the World Health Organization.


Millennium Challenge Compacts are grant agreements designed to fund specific programs that support economic growth.


Silva said Cabo Verde shares values of democracy and good governance with the U.S. in its foreign policy.


“We strongly condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we condemned the terrorist act of Hamas in Israel, and we defend solutions that make the two states of Israel and Palestine viable,” he said. “We condemn coup d’etat and changes to constitutional term limits for presidents of the republic that have occurred in Africa.”


Cabo Verde is a small island nation that has a large diaspora in the United States.


The U.S. and Cabo Verde signed a Memorandum of Understanding on defense cooperation in December 2022, focusing on maritime security.


Angola and Luanda Process


In a Monday call, Blinken spoke to Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) President Félix Tshisekedi and discussed the concerns of election observers as well as the need to enhance democratic confidence moving forward.




State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement that they also discussed the crisis in eastern DRC and potential diplomatic solutions.


Following a contentious December election, Tshisekedi, sworn in Saturday for a second term, pledged to unify the country and address conflicts in the east.


The worsening conflicts in eastern Congo have prompted countries in the region to broker two peace initiatives: the so-called Luanda Process and the Nairobi Process, according to Molly Phee, assistant secretary of state for African Affairs.


Increasing tensions between Rwanda and the DRC have led to several alleged attacks by Congolese and Rwandan forces on each other’s territory.


Angola leads the Luanda Process, where Blinken plans to hold talks with Angolan President João Lourenço and Foreign Minister Téte António.


Last week, Blinken met with Rwandan President Paul Kagame on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he reiterated the need for all actors to take concrete steps to ease tensions.


Last November, Avril Haines, the director of U.S. national intelligence, traveled to both Kinshasa and Kigali, meeting with leaders from the two neighboring countries to secure a commitment to de-escalate tensions in eastern DRC.


“We were able to institute a process of weekly check-ins that we undertook through the end of calendar year 2023,” Phee told reporters during a Thursday briefing.

## Side Channels Are Common

date: 2024-01-23, updated: 2024-01-17, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Really interesting research: &#8220;<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/genkin">Lend Me Your Ear: Passive Remote Physical Side Channels on PCs</a>.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
<p>We show that built-in sensors in commodity PCs, such as microphones, inadvertently capture electromagnetic side-channel leakage from ongoing computation. Moreover, this information is often conveyed by supposedly-benign channels such as audio recordings and common Voice-over-IP applications, even after lossy compression.</p>
<p>Thus, we show, it is possible to conduct physical side-channel attacks on computation by remote and purely passive analysis of commonly-shared channels. These attacks require neither physical proximity (which could be mitigated by distance and shielding), nor the ability to run code on the target or configure its hardware. Consequently, we argue, physical side channels on PCs can no longer be excluded from remote-attack threat models...</p></blockquote>

## One Man

Here it is January 2024, and we find ourselves reminded anew that we are in a difficult, dangerous, and deepening political reality.

## Airline incidents show a system under growing stress

date: 2024-01-23, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>For the air traveler, these have been worrying weeks.On Jan. 2, a Japan Airlines flight collided with a coast guard aircraft on the runway at Haneda Airport in Tokyo, killing five aboard the latter plane. Three days later, a fuselage panel blew off an Alaska Airlines flight from Oregon, causing a sudden cabin decompression and leading to a temporary grounding of some of Boeing Co.&#8217;s 737 Max 9 aircraft. The precise cause of that near-disaster is still to be determined. But following a spate of near-misses at US airports last year, both incidents underscore a sobering reality: The commercial aviation system is under growing stress.</p>

Last night, Florida governor Ron DeSantis dropped out of the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination and promptly endorsed former president Trump. DeSantis had tried to present himself as the alternative to Trump, but he put so little daylight between himself and the former president that he could never get traction.

## US, UK Launch More Strikes Targeting Weapons in Houthi-Controlled Yemen

date: 2024-01-23, from: VOA News USA

PENTAGON — U.S. and British warplanes, backed by surface ships and submarines, launched a series of strikes into Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen late Monday, aimed at further degrading the capabilities of Iranian-backed Houthi militants who have sought to carry out attacks against key shipping lanes in the Middle East.


U.S. defense officials said the strikes hit multiple targets across eight locations, including an underground storage facility as well as missile launch sites and other locations linked to Houthi surveillance capabilities.


The strike locations were intentionally selected to target weapons systems not to amass casualties, a senior military official told reporters. The official assessed the underground storage facility had “more advanced conventional weaponry” in it than sites hit in the first round of strikes on Jan. 11.


“These precision strikes ... are in response to a series of illegal, dangerous and destabilizing Houthi actions,” the U.S. and Britain said in a statement, noting the latest strikes were carried out with the support of Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands.


“We will not hesitate to defend lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world's most critical waterways in the face of continued threats,” the statement added.


The Red Sea route carries about 15% of the world’s maritime traffic. Major shipping companies have responded to the attacks by rerouting vessels on the longer and more expensive route around Africa.


This is the eighth time U.S. military assets have struck Houthi targets in the past 10 days, but only the second time Washington has had help since Britain took part in the initial round of strikes earlier this month. A senior military official told reporters the strikes Monday had “removed significant capability” from the Houthis to launch attacks.


A U.S. defense official “directly attributed ... the decline in the number and the ferocity of the [Houthi’s] maritime attacks … to the reduction in Houthi capability to carry out those attacks.”


“That does not mean they have no more capability, but we definitely believe that has had an impact,” another U.S. official said.


Since mid-November, the Houthis have launched 33 attacks on international shipping lanes, according to the Pentagon. The Houthis say their attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza under attack from Israel.


Defense experts worry the United States is now fighting a regional war in the Middle East amid a sharp increase in attacks on American forces over the weekend.


Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters Monday there have been 151 attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria since the October 7 Hamas terror attack against Israel, including a “barrage” of ballistic missiles fired at Ain al-Asad air base in western Iraq that constituted “a larger-scale attack than we have seen before.”


Most of the missiles were shot down, Singh said, but those that landed on the base injured one Iraqi Security Forces member and caused traumatic brain injuries in two U.S. service members.


The 151 attacks since October have injured at least 83 Americans in Iraq and Syria, a U.S. defense official said on Monday. All but two have returned to duty.


“We do not seek escalation. We don’t want to see it escalate,” Singh said Monday in response to a question from VOA.


"If you're in a scrap with somebody and you can find a way to tie one or both of their hands behind their back, that's not escalating. That's de-escalating. That's taking ability away from the other party to inflict harm,” John Kirby, National Security Council director of strategic communications, told reporters Monday at the White House.


Critics like Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, say the U.S. military’s limited strikes against Iranian-backed targets across the Middle East amount to a “shoulder shrug” response to what he said was “absolutely” a “low-level, and in some cases not-so-low-level regional war going on.”


“Don't expect to have good policy coming out of Washington if we can't be objective and honest in assessing where we sit. Full points for not wanting a regional war and trying to avoid a regional war, but news flash, we appear to have one,” Bowman told VOA.


He added that as in any conflict, the adversary also gets a vote in whether the Middle East violence erupts into a war.


“Our adversary here is [the] Islamic Republic of Iran and its network of terror proxies, and they are repeatedly trying to kill Americans. And the only reason why we haven't had more American casualties [is] because we've taken measures to defend ourselves, and we've gotten lucky. And sooner or later, luck runs out,” Bowman said.


Most of the attacks against U.S. forces inside Syria and Iraq have been claimed by an umbrella group calling itself the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which has said the attacks are in retaliation for Washington’s support for Israel in the war.


Attacks by the Iran-aligned Houthi militia on ships in and around the Red Sea for the past several weeks have bogged down trade between Asia and Europe and created fears of a widening war in the Middle East. Many of the attacks by the Houthis have targeted ships that are not associated with Israel.


Also on Monday, the U.S. sanctioned Iraqi airline Fly Baghdad and its CEO Basheer Abdulkadhim Alwan al-Shabbani, saying the airline provided assistance to Iran’s military wing and its proxy groups in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.

## Abortion on 2024 Ballot, Biden Says; Harris Tours Key States

date: 2024-01-23, from: VOA News USA

white house — Abortion is on the ballot in 2024, the White House says, with Vice President Kamala on Monday launching a cross-country tour to equate the campaign of President Joe Biden with protection and expansion of reproductive rights – as Republican candidates speak of possible federal abortion bans.


On Monday — the 51st anniversary of the landmark Roe v. Wade Supreme Court ruling that federally protected the right to have an abortion — Harris visited the battleground state of Wisconsin to highlight the Biden administration’s support of full access to reproductive health care, including abortion.


“In America, freedom is not to be given,” Harris said. “It is not to be bestowed. It is ours by right. By right. And that includes the freedom to make decisions about one’s own body. Not the government telling you what to do.”




Biden, a devoted lifelong Catholic, has expressed personal reservations about abortion. On Monday, however, he described the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade — and throw the matter to individual states — as unfair.


Since that court ruling, he noted, voters in different states have repeatedly voted to uphold abortion access.


“Voters have voted to protect reproductive rights,” Biden said. “We need these protections in every state, because for your family to have access to health care should not depend on your ZIP code.”


Followers of the current Republican presidential front-runner, Donald Trump, say Trump opposes abortion rights, but his position has varied and is unclear. His campaign website does not address the issue.


A request for comment from Trump’s campaign was not immediately returned.


U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from the Southern state of Louisiana, gave his opposition a personal spin at a recent anti-abortion rally in Washington, where he said he was the product of an unplanned teen pregnancy.


"We're passing these bills and we're marching today because it takes a lot of work to convince people that every single human child, every unborn child, has a value that is too profound and precious to ignore,” Johnson said. “And we have every reason to be optimistic, my friends, that we can change public opinion."


Anti-abortion-rights activists say they’re glad the Supreme Court put the decision back in states’ hands. But now, they must decide which national leader is going to move the issue forward.




Activist Eric Scheidler, who joined the Washington march, said that Biden was “too extreme” in his support of abortion access but that none of the remaining Republicans fit his worldview.


“I also don't know if I trust Donald Trump,” said Scheidler, who is executive director of the Illinois-based Pro-Life Action League. “I mean, he gave us the Supreme Court justices that overturned Roe. Since the overturning of Roe, he has said some things critical of the pro-life movement and criticized [Governor Ron] DeSantis’ policy in Florida. I don't really know where Trump stands, because he seems to be talking out of both sides of his mouth on the issue. So I am reserving judgment on both Haley and Trump, because I've been concerned about where both of them stand.”


Abortion rights have won at the polls with voters in states from liberal California to conservative Kansas.


The key swing state of Ohio was the latest, with a decisive 57% approving a constitutional amendment to ensure access to reproductive rights late last year.

## Chinese Music Student Faces US Trial for Allegedly Threatening Activist

date: 2024-01-23, from: VOA News USA

Boston  — A Chinese music student went on trial Monday on U.S. charges that he harassed an activist who posted flyers at the Berklee College of Music in Boston supporting democracy in China and threatened to report her activities to Chinese law enforcement.


Assistant U.S. Attorney Alathea Porter told a federal jury in Boston that Xiaolei Wu, 25, scared the activist, referred to only as Zooey in court, by making threats online to chop off her hands and report her to the Chinese government because of her "reactionary posters."


"She was afraid for herself, and she was afraid for her family, who was back in China," Porter said in her opening statement to a 12-person jury.


The trial comes as U.S. and Western authorities continue to warn that China's government has increasingly exerted pressure to silence its critics abroad.


Human rights groups have also complained of threats to academic freedom and monitoring of Chinese students on international university campuses.


Wu was first arrested in December 2022 and has pleaded not guilty to charges of cyberstalking and interstate transmissions of threatening communication.


Porter told jurors that his threats began after Zooey, who also attended the private music college, posted a photo on Instagram of a flier she put in a window that said, "We Want Freedom," "We Want Democracy" and "Stand with Chinese People."


Wu in response in October 2022 posted on a 300-person chat of Chinese Berklee students and alumni on the social media app WeChat a demand that she tear down the flyers and said he had called in a tip to a Chinese public security agency about her.


Porter called that a serious threat, as the Chinese government does not allow the type of expression her posters contained and worked to suppress dissent against the Chinese government.


A lawyer for Wu, Michael Tumposky, countered that Wu's comments were never meant to threaten Zooey but were made as part of an "immature, online dispute between two young people," who were acquainted with each other.


He said his client "was not some agent of the Chinese government" but an "awkward, nerdy guy" who came to Boston to learn jazz and had spoken out about Zooey's posters "in his own misguided way to remind her of consequences of her activism."


"He came here to learn guitar, not to shill for the Chinese Communist Party," he said.
