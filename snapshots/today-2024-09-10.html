Locks in Carbon Removal at a Milestone Price: $100 a Ton</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-10, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzYwNDAwNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MDY5NTkyNX0.t-U4kRKPBKUYLq7Cvz4-nVxTI8N7rtgpXEWezY2mFo4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Direct air capture companies are in a race to prove they can reduce the
cost of removing carbon from the atmosphere down below $100 per ton.
Now, one is closing in on the prize with a first-of-its-kind deal.
</p>
<p>
On Tuesday, Google announced it will pay the startup Holocene $10
million to remove 100,000 tons of carbon from the atmosphere, to be
delivered “by the early 2030s.” The tech giant said the price point was
made possible by the federal tax credit for carbon sequestration, and
its own willingness to cough up the bulk of the funds upfront.
</p>
<p>
There’s no question the deal is risky on both sides. Today, most
estimates place the cost of direct air capture at upwards of $600 per
ton. Bringing the cost down is essential if the tech is ever going to
play a meaningful role in tackling climate change. But even the
companies that are farthest along, like the Swiss pioneer Climeworks,
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-05/swiss-carbon-removal-startup-touts-tech-cost-cut-as-industry-eyes-further-saving" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>aren’t
sure</u></a> they will be able to offer a price of $100 per ton by 2030.
Holocene has yet to build a commercial plant, so its ability to remove
carbon for $100 per ton is pure projection at this point.
</p>
<p>
But for Google, the goal is more to catalyze a potentially important
climate solution than to clean up its carbon footprint.
</p>
<p>
“The point of our program is to help Google reach net zero in whatever
way most helps the world reach net zero,” Randy Spock, the company’s
carbon credits and removals lead, told me in an email. “So this deal is
an example of us identifying what the planet needs (long-term cost
reduction for Direct Air Capture) and then doing what we can to help it
take a step in that direction.”
</p>
<p>
Though Holocene is relatively new to the direct air capture market, it
was started by veterans. Co-founders Anca Timofte and Tobias Rüesh spent
roughly six years working in research and development at Climeworks back
in its early days, when the company was building its first prototypes.
Timofte left in 2020 to get an MBA at Stanford, and while there, came
across some exciting research out of Oak Ridge National Laboratory that
described a new approach to removing carbon from the ambient air — one
that seemed to have distinct advantages. Seeing the potential, Timofte
decided to start Holocene with Rüesh and another Stanford classmate and,
in 2023,
<a href="https://www.ornl.gov/news/direct-air-capture-technology-licensed-knoxville-based-holocene" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>licensed
the Oak Ridge technology</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
“The chemistry from Oak Ridge is special,” Timofte told me. “It’s
different than all other chemistries, we think, in direct air capture.”
</p>
<p>
Most direct air capture systems fall into one of two categories, liquid
or solid, and each approach has trade-offs. Liquid systems typically
have simpler engineering and can capture CO2 continuously, but require
more heat, and therefore more energy. Solid systems have lower heat
requirements, but work sort of like cartridges that get “charged” with
CO2 and have to be “discharged,” and therefore capture CO2 in batches
rather than in perpetuity.
</p>
<p>
Timofte described Holocene’s process as the “best of both worlds.” It
captures CO2 in water and operates in a continuous loop, but requires
relatively low heat — between 70 to 100 degrees Celsius (158 to 212
degrees Fahrenheit) — which could potentially come from a source of
waste heat like a data center. The enabling discovery was the use of two
chemicals — an amino acid and a compound called guanidine — that attract
CO2 and then further concentrate it within the water, making it easier
and less energy-intensive to isolate so that it can be stored securely
underground.
</p>
<p>
After licensing the tech, Holocene moved quickly. Within a year, the
team had
<a href="https://theholocene.co/holocene-unveils-first-industrial-dac-pilot/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>built
a small pilot plant</u></a> in Knoxville, Tennessee that’s capable of
capturing about 10 tons of CO2 annually. That’s, of course, a totally
insignificant amount, but it’s enough for the team to demonstrate its
approach to potential funders and to keep testing variations on the
basic chemistry to refine the system, Timofte told me.
</p>
<p>
Timofte said the company has made it this far with just over $6 million
in grants and prizes from the Department of Energy, Bill Gates’
Breakthrough Energy, and Frontier Climate, a coalition of carbon removal
buyers that includes Google in addition to other tech companies. The
$500,000 that Holocene got from Frontier was
<a href="https://frontierclimate.com/portfolio?supplier_id=climsup_holocene" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>technically
a pre-purchase of 332 tons of removal</u></a>, which would put the
current cost per ton at roughly $1,500.
</p>
<p>
Frontier’s pre-purchases are not a precise indicator of price as they
are meant to
“<a href="https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/climate/2023-prepurchase-rfp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pressure-test
the viability of novel CDR solutions</u></a>,” and are granted with the
expectation that some ventures will fail. Still, even with a fresh
influx of cash from Google and the prospect of a $180 per ton tax credit
from the federal government, the company has a steep climb ahead.
Timofte told me the team is beginning to fundraise to build their next
project — a 2,000- to 5,000-ton per year demonstration plant. When asked
about how it reached the $100 per ton deal with Google, she stressed
that having a delivery date past 2030 was crucial to the deal.
</p>
<p>
The industry’s fixation on achieving $100 per ton is somewhat arbitrary.
A
<a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/25259/chapter/7#191" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2019
National Academies of Sciences report</u></a> found that estimates of
the cost of capturing CO2 via direct air capture spanned “an order of
magnitude, from $100 to $1,000” per ton. In 2021, the Biden
administration’s Department of Energy set a goal to bring the cost of
all kinds of carbon removal below $100 per ton, which seemed to solidify
the goal across the field. In 2022, the nonprofit CarbonPlan surveyed
carbon removal buyers, suppliers, and brokers, and found that $100 per
ton was a common benchmark. “If cost were $100/ton, demand would be
practically unlimited,” one supplier said. “Bringing down cost to
$100/ton for CDR would be the sweet spot,” said a buyer. CarbonPlan
pointed out, however, that the responses weren’t consistent on whether
$100 per ton was the desired break-even point for carbon removal
companies or the desired price for buyers.
</p>
<p>
“I think we focus too much on the cost of DAC,” Erin Burns, the
executive director of the nonprofit Carbon180 told me when I asked her
if $100 per ton was a meaningful goal. “Sure, DAC should and will get
cheaper. But we need to also be thinking, right now, about things like
renewable energy availability, infrastructure, and reducing emissions as
quickly as possible.”
</p>
<p>
Finding clean sources of power for direct air capture is becoming more
of an issue as companies try to scale. At the end of August, a startup
called CarbonCapture
Inc. <a href="https://www.carboncapture.com/newsroom/deployment-update" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a>
it would try to relocate a commercial-scale project it had planned to
build in Wyoming because it was struggling to procure enough clean
energy to power the plant due to competition with data centers and
cryptocurrency miners.
</p>
<p>
Timofte agreed that “clean electrons are hard to come by,” but added
that Holocene’s potential to use waste heat might make it a little
easier for the company.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want to dismiss the challenge. I think this is the challenge
that everyone faces. We each have to solve it, and the solutions are
going to be individual.”

<li>Report finds climate change is disrupting education world wide
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Since 2022, more than 400 million students across the

climate crisis, according to a
<a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/9d1c318a-bcd3-49fa-b1c6-cc03e18d4670/content?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8b7QjhUcEnCiU42R53_mgjXHICpbkY5ToG6C_PKAGm90AAbwsMphD3G9svgKSVD05iqi2L" target="_blank">report</a>
from the World Bank. The problem is especially acute in low-income
countries, where children miss 18 school days each year on average
because of events like drought, floods, and extreme heat. That’s
compared to 2.4 days lost each year in wealthier nations. The report
points to the link between education and overall awareness of the
climate crisis and its causes. It finds that education makes people more
climate aware, more adaptive, more likely to engage in pro-climate
behavior, and more likely to change mindsets in their communities with
conversations around climate change. And of course, it says education is
essential for training people in the skills needed for the green
transition. The analysis calls for governments to invest in helping
schools adapt, and says such efforts could cost as little as

id="google-loses-final-eu-court-appeal-against-2.7-billion-fine-in-antitrust-shopping-case">Google
loses final EU court appeal against $2.7 billion fine in antitrust
shopping case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>London — Google lost its final legal challenge on Tuesday against a
European Union penalty for giving its own shopping recommendations an
illegal advantage over rivals in search results, ending a long-running
antitrust case that came with a whopping fine. </p>
<p>The European Union’s Court of Justice upheld a lower court’s
decision, rejecting the company’s appeal against the $2.7 billion
penalty from the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s top antitrust
enforcer. </p>
<p>“By today’s judgment, the Court of Justice dismisses the appeal and
thus upholds the judgment of the General Court,” the court said in a
press release summarizing its decision. </p>
<p>The commission’s punished the Silicon Valley giant in 2017 for
unfairly directing visitors to its own Google Shopping service to the
detriment of competitors. It was one of three multibillion-dollar fines
that the commission imposed on Google in the previous decade as Brussels
started ramping up its crackdown on the tech industry. </p>
<p>“We are disappointed with the decision of the Court, which relates to
a very specific set of facts,” Google said in a brief statement. </p>
<p>The company said it made changes in 2017 to comply with the
commission’s decision requiring it to treat competitors equally. It
started holding auctions for shopping search listings that it would bid
for alongside other comparison shopping services. </p>
<p>“Our approach has worked successfully for more than seven years,
generating billions of clicks for more than 800 comparison shopping
services,” Google said. </p>
<p>At the same time, the company appealed the decision to the courts.
But the EU General Court, the tribunal’s lower section, rejected its
challenge in 2021 and the Court of Justice’s adviser later recommended
rejecting the appeal. </p>
<p>European consumer group BEUC hailed the court’s decision, saying it
shows how the bloc’s competition law “remains highly relevant” in
digital markets. </p>
<p>“Google harmed millions of European consumers by ensuring that rival
comparison shopping services were virtually invisible,” director general
Agustín Reyna said. “Google’s illegal practices prevented consumers from
accessing potentially cheaper prices and useful product information from
rival comparison shopping services on all sorts of products, from
clothes to washing machines.”</p>

US, Chinese military brass hold first call to stabilize ties</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIJING — The United States and China held theater-level commander
talks for the first time on Tuesday, Chinese authorities said, amid
efforts to stabilize military ties and avoid misunderstandings,
especially in regional hot spots such as the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Washington seeks to open new channels of regular military
communication with Beijing since ties sank to a historic low after the
United States downed a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon last
year.</p>
<p>Admiral Sam Paparo, head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, held a
video telephone call with his counterpart Wu Yanan of the Southern
Theater Command of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).</p>
<p>The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command’s areas of responsibility include the
South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, two hot spots for regional
tension that are also flashpoints in U.S.-China bilateral ties.</p>
<p>Both sides had an “in depth exchange of views on issues of common
concern,” the Chinese defense ministry said in a readout.</p>
<p>Paparo urged the PLA “to reconsider its use of dangerous, coercive,
and potentially escalatory tactics in the South China Sea and beyond,”
the Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement that described the exchange
as “constructive and respectful.”</p>
<p>He also stressed the importance of continued talks to clarify intent
and reduce the risk of misperception or miscalculation.</p>
<p>The call followed a meeting in Beijing last month between U.S.
National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s
leading military adviser, at which the talks were agreed.</p>
<p>U.S. and Chinese troops were also taking part in large-scale military
exercises led by the Brazilian Armed Forces this week in the Brazilian
city of Formosa in the state of Goiás.</p>
<p>American and Chinese troops had not trained side by side since 2016,
when Beijing participated in the Rim of the Pacific Exercise, or Rimpac,
led by the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command.</p>
<p>Most two-way military engagements between the U.S. and China were
suspended for almost two years after Nancy Pelosi, then speaker of the
U.S. House of Representatives, visited Taiwan in August 2022.</p>
<p>“I certainly worry about an unintended conflict between our military
forces, an accident, an accidental collision,” Nicholas Burns, the U.S.
ambassador to China, told the magazine Foreign Policy in an online
interview.</p>

id="francine-gains-strength-expected-to-be-hurricane-when-it-reaches-us-gulf-coast">Francine
gains strength, expected to be hurricane when it reaches US Gulf
Coast</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BATON ROUGE, La. — Tropical Storm Francine churned in the Gulf of
Mexico with increasing strength and was expected to reach hurricane
status on Tuesday before reaching landfall in Louisiana.</p>
<p>A storm surge warning was in effect for an area stretching from just
east of Houston to the mouth of the Mississippi River south of New
Orleans, according to the National Hurricane Center. Such a warning
means there’s a chance of life-threatening flooding.</p>
<p>Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry urged residents “not to panic, but be
prepared” and heed evacuation warnings. Forecasters said Francine’s
landfall in south Louisiana was expected Wednesday afternoon as a
Category 2 hurricane with winds of 155-175 kph.</p>
<p>“We do not want people to wait to the last minute to get on the road
and then run out of fuel,” Landry said. “We put a lot of information
throughout the summer, throughout hurricane season, so that people can
be prepared. The more prepared we are, the easier it is for us.”</p>
<p>Francine is taking aim at a Louisiana coastline that has yet to fully
recover since hurricanes Laura and Delta decimated Lake Charles in 2020,
followed a year later by Hurricane Ida. Over the weekend, a 22-story
building in Lake Charles that had become a symbol of storm destruction
was imploded after sitting vacant for nearly four years, its windows
shattered and covered in shredded tarps.</p>
<p>Francine’s storm surge on the Louisiana coast could reach as much as
10 feet (3 meters) from Cameron to Port Fourchon and into Vermilion Bay,
forecasters said.</p>
<p>“It’s a potential for significantly dangerous, life-threatening
inundation,” said Michael Brennan, director of the hurricane center,
adding it could also send “dangerous, damaging winds quite far
inland.”</p>
<p>He said landfall was likely somewhere between Sabine Pass — on the
Texas-Louisiana line — and Morgan City, Louisiana, 350 kilometers to the
east.</p>
<p>Louisiana officials urged residents to immediately prepare while
“conditions still allow,” said Mike Steele, spokesperson for the
Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness.</p>
<p>“We always talk about how anytime something gets into the Gulf,
things can change quickly, and this is a perfect example of that,”
Steele said.</p>
<p>Residents of Baton Rouge, Louisiana’s capital, began forming long
lines as people filled gas tanks and stocked up on groceries. Others
filled sandbags at city-operated locations to protect homes from
possible flooding.</p>
<p>“It’s crucial that all of us take this storm very seriously and begin
our preparations immediately,” Baton Rouge Mayor-President Sharon Weston
Broome said, urging residents to stock up on three days of food, water
and essentials.</p>
<p>A mandatory evacuation was ordered for seven remote coastal
communities by the Cameron Parish Office of Homeland Security &amp;
Emergency Preparedness. They include Holly Beach, a laid-back stretch
dubbed Louisiana’s “Cajun Riviera,” where many homes sit on stilts. The
storm-battered town has been a low-cost paradise for oil industry
workers, families and retirees, rebuilt multiple times after past
hurricanes.</p>
<p>In Grand Isle, Louisiana’s last inhabited barrier island, Mayor David
Camardelle recommended residents evacuate and ordered a mandatory
evacuation for those in recreational vehicles. Hurricane Ida decimated
the city three years ago, destroying 700 homes.</p>
<p>Officials warn that flooding, along with high winds and power
outages, is likely in the area beginning Tuesday afternoon through
Thursday.</p>
<p>In New Orleans, Mayor LaToya Cantrell urged residents to prepare to
shelter in place. “Now is the time to finalize your storm plans and
prepare, not only for your families but looking out for your neighbors,”
she said.</p>
<p>City officials said they were expecting up to 15 centimeters inches
of rain, gusty winds and “isolated tornado activity” with the most
intense weather likely to reach New Orleans on Wednesday and
Thursday.</p>
<p>The hurricane center said Francine was last about 205 kilometers
south-southeast of the mouth of the Rio Grande, and about 690 kilometers

<h2 id="amd-deprioritizing-flagship-gaming-gpus">AMD deprioritizing
flagship gaming GPUs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>I had a chance to speak to Jack Huynh, AMD’s senior vice president
and general manager of the Computing and Graphics Business Group, during
IFA 2024 in a question and answer session. Due to speculation that AMD
won’t launch flagship GPUs for its next-gen lineup, I pressed Huynh for
information regarding the company’s plans for the high-end GPU market
with the RDNA 4-powered Radeon RX 8000-series. His comments sketch out a
plan focused specifically on gaining market share in the GPU market
above all else, and this strategy deprioritizes chasing Nvidia’s
highest-end gaming cards — at least for now. ↫ Paul Alcorn at Tom’s
Hardware Reading through the actual comments, it seems that AMD is not
going to chase the very, extreme high-end that NVIDIA serves, like the
4090 level of GPUs. Honestly, I’m completely okay with that – those
high-end GPUs are insanely expensive, and unlike what YouTube and tech
websites might suggest, nobody buys these GPUs. Consistently, for more
than a decade now, it’s the xx60-xx70 levels of cards that dominate the
market, and it’s smart of AMD (and Intel) to focus on that segment if
you want to sell as many GPUs as possible. The very top of the GPU
market just doesn’t make a lot price/performance sense. You pay
considerably more for a 4090 compared to a 4080, but the price increase
does not correspond to a similar increase in performance. It simply
makes a lot more sense to save that money and spend it elsewhere, such
as on a better CPU, more RAM, more storage, or a new display. I’d rather
AMD not waste time and energy on making these high-end GPUs nobody buys,
and instead focus on improving the GPUs people actually buy. And of
course, AMD just hasn’t been able to match NVIDIA at the top end, and
that’s probably not going to change any time soon. Releasing a high-end,
expensive GPU, only to be trounced by your one competitor every single
time is not a good look, so why even try?</p>

id="experts-applaud-us-steps-to-disrupt-russian-disinformation">Experts
applaud US steps to disrupt Russian disinformation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The U.S. Justice Department announced September 4 that
two Russian nationals, Kostiantyn Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva, had
been charged with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Agents Registration
Act and conspiracy to commit money laundering in the Southern District
of New York.</p>
<p>“The Justice Department has charged two employees of RT, a Russian
state-controlled media outlet, in a $10 million scheme to create and
distribute content to U.S. audiences with hidden Russian government
messaging,” said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland. “The Justice
Department will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to
exploit our country’s free exchange of ideas in order to covertly
further its own propaganda efforts, and our investigation into this
matter remains ongoing.”</p>
<p>That same day, the Justice Department announced the seizure of 32
internet domains used in the Russian government-directed “Doppelganger”
foreign malign influence campaign, which it said violated U.S.
money-laundering and criminal trademark laws.</p>
<p>Experts who study disinformation say disrupting the paid-influencer
campaign is an important step in efforts to counter the Kremlin’s
broader disinformation strategy of spreading propaganda that undermines
support for Ukraine and stokes American political divisions.</p>
<p>Disrupting the Doppelganger campaign</p>
<p>“Persistent efforts to impersonate authoritative news websites and
promote their content at scale in a coordinated manner can have a
tangible impact, casting propaganda narratives far and wide
consistently,” wrote Roman Osadchuk and Eto Buziashvili, researchers at
the Disinformation Research Lab of the Atlantic Council, a Washington
think tank.</p>
<p>According to an FBI affidavit, Russia’s “Doppelganger” campaign
created domains impersonating legitimate media sites, produced fake
social media profiles and deployed “influencers” worldwide.</p>
<p>According to the Atlantic Council researchers, the primary method
used by those involved in “Doppelganger” is to post, on X and other
social media platforms, links to fake news sites in replies to posts by
politicians, celebrities, influencers and others with large
audiences.</p>
<p>Osadchuk told VOA that while the FBI’s measures are unlikely to stop
Russian influence activities, they will make them more costly, noting
those involved in the Russian influence campaign will be forced “to
rewrite scripts, change the operation’s infrastructure, etc.”</p>
<p>At the same time, according to Osadchuk, the U.S. government’s moves
against those involved in the influence campaign, which were widely
covered in the U.S. and international media, will educate a broader
audience.</p>
<p>“Researchers of the Russian disinformation have known about the
Doppelganger campaign for some time,” he said. “Now, Americans and
people in other countries have learned about it and maybe will become
more aware that not all information they consume is coming from
legitimate sources and hopefully will be more attentive to the domain
names and other signs that might indicate that the page they are reading
is not The Washington Post or Fox News but a fake created by
Kremlin-linked entities.”</p>
<p>Influencers will be more aware</p>
<p>In a statement it released after indicting the two RT employees, the
Justice Department said that “over at least the past year, RT and its
employees, including Kalashnikov and Afanasyeva, deployed nearly $10
million to covertly finance and direct a Tennessee-based online content
creation company [U.S. Company-1],” and that “U.S. Company-1” had
“published English-language videos on multiple social media channels,
including TikTok, Instagram, X and YouTube.”</p>
<p>While the Justice Department did not specifically identify “U.S.
Company-1,” it is thought to refer to Tenet Media, a Tennessee company
co-founded by entrepreneur Lauren Chen, who recruited six popular U.S.
influencers with a large following.</p>
<p>YouTube subsequently took down Tenet Media’s channel on the platform,
along with four other channels that YouTube said were operated by
Chen.</p>
<p>Bret Schafer, a disinformation researcher at the Alliance for
Securing Democracy, a political advocacy group set up under the auspices
of the German Marshall Fund, a Washington think tank, told VOA that by
financing the U.S. content creation company, Russia was able to create
an information channel with a large audience, and to use it for such
messages as blaming the U.S. and Ukraine for the March terrorist attack
at a Moscow concert hall.</p>
<p>Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack.</p>
<p>Shutting down that Russian information channel sent a powerful
message to influencers and content creators to do “due diligence about
people funding their work and to try to figure out who’s behind these
companies and their motives,” Schafer added.</p>
<p>Ben Dubow, a disinformation researcher affiliated with the Center for
European Policy Analysis, a Washington-based research group, believes
that influencers contracted by Tenet Media are unlikely to lose their
existing followers, but that they might have difficulty attracting new
ones.</p>
<p>“Hopefully, people who might otherwise explore those influencers will
recognize their names and understand them as untrustworthy now,” he told
VOA.</p>
<p>The Justice Department’s indictment quotes RT’s editor-in-chief,
Margarita Simonian, as saying in an interview on Russian television that
RT built “an enormous network, an entire empire of covert projects,” to
influence Western audiences.</p>
<p>The FBI affidavit also revealed that one of the sanctioned Russian
companies had a list of 2,800 people active on social media in the U.S.
and 80 other countries, including “television and radio hosts,
politicians, bloggers, journalists, businessmen, professors, think-tank
analysts, veterans, professors and comedians,” whom the company refers
to as “influencers.”</p>
<p>Concrete steps and good timing</p>
<p>Several experts commended the U.S. government for taking concrete
steps.</p>
<p>“They are sanctioning individuals and disrupting the supply chain of
influence available to these threat actors,” noted Olga Belogolova,
director of the Emerging Technologies Initiative at the Johns Hopkins
School of Advanced International Studies.</p>
<p>“Punitive measures absolutely have to be part of the package,” said
Jakub Kalenský, a senior analyst at the European Centre of Excellence
for Countering Hybrid Threats in Helsinki. “Otherwise, the aggressors
have a free hand to continue their aggression unopposed. And in order to
identify those who deserve to be punished, a proper investigation from
the authorities is necessary.”</p>
<p>Experts also said that the Justice Department’s actions were taken
early enough to prevent influence in the November U.S. elections and to
signal to Russia and other foreign actors that the U.S. government is
monitoring their actions and will respond aggressively.</p>
<p>“Of course, that was what the Obama administration was concerned
about in 2016 and led to them not being as transparent as they probably
should have been with the American public about what they knew about
Russian interference,” Schafer said.</p>
<p>In announcing their actions against the Russian disinformation
campaign, U.S. government representatives did not mention which
political party or candidate they thought that the Russians were trying
to assist.</p>
<p>“I know that the U.S. government, including agencies and the Foreign
Malign Influence Center at ODNI [Office of the Director of National
Intelligence], have been doing a lot of thinking over the last few years
about how to strategically communicate these actions without
unintentionally amplifying the very campaigns they are trying to thwart
or politicizing the topic. And I think they’ve actually done a good job
of striking that balance, at least from what I’ve seen thus far,”
Belogolova said.</p>
<p>Ihor Solovey, who heads the Ukrainian government’s Center for
Strategic Communication and Information Security, welcomed the U.S.
government’s actions but told VOA that more steps are needed to thwart
Russian activities on social media.</p>
<p>“X, TikTok or even more so the Russian Telegram - they are unlikely
to want to spend on the fight against bots, troll farms or planned
disinformation,” he said, adding that only pressure by a state, or even
a coalition of states, will be able to force these social media
platforms to block intruders and malicious content.</p>

id="morgan-wallen-leads-the-2024-country-music-association-award-nominations">Morgan
Wallen leads the 2024 Country Music Association award nominations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — He had some help: Morgan Wallen tops the 2024 Country
Music Association Awards nominations with seven.</p>
<p>For a third year in a row, Wallen is up for both the top prize —
entertainer of the year — and the male vocalist categories.</p>
<p>Rounding out the entertainer of the year categories are Luke Combs,
Jelly Roll, Chris Stapleton and Lainey Wilson.</p>
<p>Post Malone’s massive radio hit, “I Had Some Help,” which features
Wallen, is the main reason why the country singer leads the pack this
year. It is up for single, song, musical event and music video of the
year. His last nomination is a second one in the musical event category,
for his collaboration with Eric Church, “Man Made a Bar.”</p>
<p>Single of the year is awarded to the artist, producer and mix
engineers; song of the year is given to the songwriters.</p>
<p>Ahead of the nominations announcement, some fans speculated that
Beyoncé, whose landmark country-and-then-some reclamation Cowboy Carter
was released during the eligibility window, could receive a nomination
at the 2024 CMAs. She did not.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the album hit No. 1 on the Billboard country
albums chart, making her the first Black woman to top the chart since
its 1964 inception.</p>
<p>The album was five years in the making, a direct result of what
Beyoncé has called “an experience that I had years ago where I did not
feel welcomed … and it was very clear that I wasn’t,” most likely a
reference to a 2016 CMAs performance that resulted in racist
backlash.</p>
<p>The CMA Awards are nominated and voted on by members of the Country
Music Association, which includes music executives, artists, publicists,
songwriters and other industry professionals.</p>
<p>Wallen is followed by both Cody Johnson, who is also nominated in the
male vocalist category for the third year in a row, and 7-time male
vocalist of the year winner, Stapleton.</p>
<p>Stapleton and Johnson have five nominations each.</p>
<p>But Stapleton could take home seven trophies, should he sweep his
categories.</p>
<p>Stapleton is both an artist and producer on “White Horse,” up for
single of the year, and Higher, up for album of the year.</p>
<p>At the CMAs, production credits are not counted as separate
nominations, although they are factored into trophy counts.</p>
<p>First-time nominee Post Malone and Wilson, last year’s entertainer of
the year winner, are tied with four nominations. All of Malone’s
nominations are for “I Had Some Help.”</p>
<p>Louis Bell, Charlie Handsome and Hoskins are tied with three
nominations for their work as producers and co-writers on “I Had Some
Help.”</p>
<p>Jelly Roll, Combs, Kacey Musgraves and Megan Moroney also boast three
nods each. The latter three could take home four trophies: Combs is both
artist and producer on Fathers &amp; Sons, up for album of the year. The
same is true for Musgraves’ album Deeper Well.</p>
<p>And Moroney is both artist and director of her nominated music video,
“I’m Not Pretty.”</p>
<p>The CMA Awards will air on November 20 on ABC at 8 p.m. Eastern. It
can be streamed the next day on Hulu.</p>

signals support for reclassifying pot as a less dangerous drug, in line
with Harris’ position</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Donald Trump has signaled support for a potentially
historic federal policy shift to reclassify marijuana as a less
dangerous drug, putting his position in line with that of his Democratic
opponent, Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>The commonality reflects a major shift toward broad public support
for legalization in recent years and marks the first time that both
major-party presidential candidates support broad cannabis reform,
according to the U.S. Cannabis Council.</p>
<p>The Republican presidential nominee posted on his social media
platform late Sunday that he would “continue to focus on research to
unlock the medical uses of marijuana to a Schedule 3 drug,” and also
said he would be voting “yes” on a proposal to allow the sale of
marijuana to adults for any reason in Florida.</p>
<p>Coming shortly before the two will meet for a pivotal debate, Trump’s
post sets up the possibility that he could criticize Harris for her past
cannabis prosecutions when she was district attorney in San Francisco.
Because drug prosecutions disproportionately affect nonwhite defendants
in the U.S., the line of attack could also fit with Trump’s efforts to
increase his support among nonwhite men.</p>
<p>Harris backs decriminalization and has called it “absurd” that the
Drug Enforcement Administration now has marijuana in the Schedule I
category alongside heroin and LSD.</p>
<p>Earlier in her career, she oversaw the enforcement of cannabis laws
and opposed legalized recreational use for adults in California while
running for attorney general in 2010.</p>
<p>Harris has absorbed attacks on her prosecutorial record on the debate
stage before, most notably from Democrat-turned-Trump supporter Tulsi
Gabbard, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 and
announced in 2022 that she was leaving the party.</p>
<p>Trump said during his 2016 run that pot policy should be left up the
states. During his term in the White House, though, then-Attorney
General Jeff Sessions lifted an Obama-era policy that kept federal
authorities from cracking down on the marijuana trade in states where
the drug is legal.</p>
<p>The DEA process to change the drug’s federal classification is
already underway, kickstarted by President Joe Biden’s call for a
review. But the DEA hasn’t made a final decision on the shift, which
would not legalize recreational marijuana outright. It may not decide
until the next presidential administration, putting a spotlight on the
candidates’ positions.</p>
<p>Federal drug policy has lagged behind that of many states in recent
years, with 38 having already legalized medical marijuana and 24
legalizing recreational use.</p>
<p>About 70% of adults supported legalization in a Gallup poll taken
last year, the highest level yet recorded by the polling firm and more
than double the roughly 3 in 10 who backed it in 2000. Support was even
higher among young voters, a key demographic in seven main battleground
states.</p>
<p>“We believe cannabis reform is a winning issue,” said David Culver,
senior vice president of public affairs at the U.S. Cannabis Council, in
a statement Monday.</p>
<p>The federal policy shift wouldn’t legalize marijuana outright for
recreational use. Instead, it would move marijuana out of Schedule I to
the Schedule III category, alongside ketamine and some anabolic
steroids.</p>
<p>The proposed shift is facing opposition from advocates who say there
isn’t enough data and from attorneys general in more than a dozen
states, according to the group Smart Approaches to Marijuana.</p>
<p>Trump chimed in on the ballot question on the same day that Florida
Governor Ron DeSantis, a fellow Republican who previously challenged him
for the 2024 presidential nomination, spoke at City Church Tallahassee,
where he ardently opposed two ballot initiatives this November: one to
enshrine abortion rights and the other to legalize recreational
marijuana.</p>
<p>For months DeSantis has publicly opposed the marijuana amendment,
saying it would reduce the quality of life in Florida cities by leaving
a marijuana stench in the air.</p>
<p>The Florida Republican Party has also formally denounced the
amendment, saying in a May resolution that it would “benefit powerful
marijuana special interests, while putting children at risk and
endangering Florida family-friendly business and tourism climates.”</p>

<h2 id="us-facing-more-scattered-more-technological-terror-landscape">US
facing more scattered, more technological terror landscape</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Leading terror groups like al-Qaida and Islamic State,
once pushed to the brink after years of military pressure from the
United States and its allies, have found ways to recover and once again
represent a serious and lethal threat, according to a top U.S.
counterterrorism official. </p>
<p>The rare public assessment from the acting director of the U.S.
National Counterterrorism Center comes just days before the 23rd
anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, al-Qaida terror attacks on the U.S.
The attacks killed nearly 3,000 people, and emphasized the impact of
more recent terror strikes and of technology in galvanizing the terror
landscape. </p>
<p>“We are today in the midst of another transformative moment in the
global terrorism threat landscape,” said the NCTC’s Brett Holmgren,
speaking to a counterterrorism symposium in New York. </p>
<p>“Groups like ISIS just a few years ago were at their nadir,” he said,
using an acronym for the Islamic State terror group, also known as IS or
Daesh.  </p>
<p>But now the U.S. sees “a much more distributed threat, in part
because of some of the counterterrorism pressures that have been
applied,” Holmgren added.  </p>
<p>“We see a real proliferation of the threat and really a shift
towards, at least for al-Qaida, the center of gravity in parts of
Africa,” he said. “You see, frankly, al-Qaida basically [was] kicked out
of Afghanistan over the last few years, and they have a very small
footprint left there.</p>
<p>“You also see the Islamic State and others that have been pushed out
of their safe havens in Syria, where they are now deliberately operating
in much smaller cells to evade detection,” he added.  </p>
<p>As a result, the threat posed by al-Qaida and IS to the U.S. are not
the same as they once were, according to Holmgren, echoing statements by
other top U.S. intelligence officials that while the terror
organizations and their affiliates have a desire to strike at the U.S.,
they are, for now, lacking the ability to do so. </p>
<p>“The capacity and the capability is not there,” Holmgren said, citing
sustained counterterrorism pressure from the U.S. and its allies. </p>
<p>Instead, U.S. counterterrorism officials see al-Qaida and IS
embracing the online environment to recruit and, in some cases, provide
resources to individuals in the West to carry out attacks on their
own. </p>
<p>Other nations, however, including some U.S. allies, are not as
convinced that the threat from hotspots like Afghanistan and Syria have
diminished. </p>
<p>A United Nations report this past July, based on intelligence from
member states, argued that al-Qaida has thrived in Afghanistan,
benefiting from the protection of the Taliban government while expanding
its network of training camps and safe houses. </p>
<p>And U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in the Middle
East and South Asia, said separately in July that the pace of IS attacks
in Syria and Iraq is set to double compared to last year. </p>
<p>The political wing of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic forces has
issued similar warnings in the past year. </p>
<p>But Holmgren and other U.S. intelligence officials argue the biggest
danger, for now, is what al-Qaida, IS and other terror groups can
organize online. </p>
<p>U.S. officials see signs that al-Qaida, IS and even Iranian-backed
terror groups like Hezbollah have embraced AI, or artificial
intelligence, using the technology to produce higher-quality and more
targeted propaganda. </p>
<p>And while the use of AI may not be sophisticated, officials say there
is evidence it has been effective, both in gaining followers and in
using AI-generated voices and images, to help terrorist operatives evade
detection. </p>
<p>Additionally, the new push by terror groups like al-Qaida and IS
continues to be super-charged by last year’s October 7 Hamas terror
attack carried out against Israel in which the group — designated as a
terrorist organization by the U.S., United Kingdom and European Union —
killed about 1,200 people, with another 250 taken hostage.  </p>
<p>More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed due to Israel’s
retaliatory offensive against Hamas. And a range of terror groups has
seized on the conflict to call for attacks against the West. </p>
<p>The Hamas attack sparked a “tectonic shift in the threat
environment,” said Rebecca Weiner, the New York Police Department’s
deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism. </p>
<p>“The ripple effects that we have experienced since October 7, that we
will experience over the years to come, they’re not really ripples.
They’re waves,” she said, speaking at the symposium in New York. “I
don’t really expect things to get too much better, unfortunately, in the
months ahead.” </p>
<p>The NCTC’s Holmgren called the October 7 attack a “unique
flashpoint.” </p>
<p>“That is, in our view, the most consequential event when it comes to
violent Islamic extremism in terms of radicalization and recruitment
since 9/11,” he said. “It’s really remarkable in how it’s united these
really disparate groups, from neo-Nazis to al-Qaida to Iranian-linked
groups.” </p>
<p>There are also fears the AI-enhanced propaganda and recruitment
drives have been especially efficient at targeting young adults and
teenagers. </p>
<p>“We have a whole new generation of homegrown violent, violent
extremists, especially younger individuals and juveniles, to worry
about,” said the NYPD’s Weiner. “The younger people who are
radicalizing, who [are] unable to incorporate all this information that
they’re receiving in a digital world and bring that into the 3D context
in a way that’s safe.</p>

Grid Is Losing Its Balance</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Here’s a dilemma: Large chunks of fossil fuel-powered energy generation
are scheduled to
<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/generator-retirements-threaten-grid-reliability-NERC/702504/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fall
off the U.S. electric grid</a> in the next decade thanks to economic and
regulatory pressures. Even larger chunks of renewable energy generation
have not yet been approved to connect to the grid and may not be for
years, <a href="https://emp.lbl.gov/queues" target="_blank">if ever</a>.
Meanwhile, data centers and electrification have kicked off the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/pjm-interconnection-forecast-electricity-data-centers-evs" target="_self">f</a><a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/pjm-interconnection-forecast-electricity-data-centers-evs" target="_self">irst
notable demand growth for electricity markets</a> in over 20 years. On
top of all that, the grid has become increasingly vulnerable to climate
change-fueled disruptions, whether from solar power being knocked out by
hail or natural gas lines freezing in an ice storm.<span></span>
</p>
<p>
In some parts of the country, the solution to this dilemma is relatively
simple. In much of the Southeast and -west, large utilities that own
power plants
<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/georgia-power-approval-plant-yates-irp/713404/" target="_blank">are
simply building more natural gas power plants</a>. In California,
regulators are mandating that utilities procure enormous amounts of
energy storage, and have rejiggered residential solar rules to encourage
more combinations of solar panels and batteries. And Texas is planning
to lend billions of dollars at low interest rates to help finance
natural gas plant construction.
</p>
<p>
Then there’s the PJM Interconnection, the 13-state electricity market
serving much of the East Coast and Midwest, run by the country’s largest
regional transmission organization. Despite PJM’s constant warnings
about natural gas and coal generation retiring, it has not been able to
bring new generating resources online in a reasonable timeframe. The
grid operator — technically a non-profit — has neither the regulatory
muscle nor the financial firepower to shape new energy generation to its
preferences; its interconnection queue got so long, it instituted a
two-year
<a href="https://www.bracewell.com/resources/ferc-finalizes-interconnection-queue-reforms-2/#:~:text=Before%20filing%20the%20reforms%2C%20PJM%20implemented%20a%20two%2Dyear%20pause%20on%20new%20interconnection%20requests%20and%20has%20represented%20that%20it%20has%20a%20significant%20backlog%20of%20interconnection%20requests" target="_blank">pause
on new applications</a>.
</p>
<p>
While many of PJM’s problems are unique to its particular circumstances,
they’ve gotten so severe in recent months, it calls into question
whether the decades-long project of structuring electricity generation,
transmission, and distribution into something like a market is even
working anymore.
</p>
<p>
“The whole premise is that a capacity market is about efficient entry
and efficient exit,” Abe Silverman, an assistant research scholar at
Johns Hopkins and former New Jersey utility regulatory official, told
me. “We’re squeezing the tube on the entry side and letting very few new
entrants in.”
</p>
<p>
<span></span>According to PJM’s independent market monitor, at the end
of last year, there were just over 7 gigawatts of natural gas projects
in the queue, about half of which it expected to go into service
eventually, while some 24 gigawatts to 58 gigawatts of coal and natural
gas is expected to retire by 2030. There were over 200 gigawatts of
renewables projects in the queue, the market monitor said, but only
around 30 gigawatts that’s expected to go into service, and for the
purpose of a capacity auction, only about 11 would count.
</p>
<p>
But for power market observers, the sirens really started going off at
the end of July, when PJM held what’s called a capacity auction, which
determines the price companies get paid to supply energy-generating
capacity over and above forecasted peak demand
<a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/library/reports-notices/special-reports/2023/energy-transition-in-pjm-resource-retirements-replacements-and-risks.ashx" target="_blank">in
order to avoid blackouts</a>. By the end of the five-day process, the
cost of that capacity came out almost 10 times higher for than the
previous PJM capacity auction —
<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/pjm-interconnection-capacity-auction-vistra-constellation/722872/" target="_blank">$14.7
billion, compared to just over $2 billion</a> in 2022 — a signal that
supply, demand, and reliability dynamics within PJM are seriously
imbalanced.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong></strong>That almost certainly means rate increases for
consumers. In Maryland specifically, some residential electricity bills
could rise anywhere from 2% to 24%, a monthly change of $4 to $18,
<a href="https://opc.maryland.gov/Portals/0/Files/Publications/RMR%20Bill%20and%20Rates%20Impact%20Report_2024-08-14%20Final.pdf?ver=V9hZfyTmjLeNVt2Dg3cTgw%3d%3d" target="_blank">according
to the state’s Office of People’s Counsel</a>.
</p>
<p>
What that almost certainly does <em>not</em> mean is a huge amount of
new generation coming online. “In an efficient capacity market
structure, the market starts sending higher price signals and generators
start coming on-line,” Silverman told me. “Usually when you see high
prices, you would expect more of a response from the supply side.”
</p>
<p>
In PJM, however, “new generation cannot come online quickly,” according
to a letter from
<a href="https://opc.maryland.gov/Portals/0/Files/Publications/Others/Final%20letter%20to%20PJM%20Board%20on%20RMRs%20and%20the%20capacity%20market%2008.30.2024%20.pdf?ver=RBqFgxkwK3ZZYlsKeC-LjQ%3d%3d" target="_blank">a
group of consumer advocates in PJM states</a>, therefore “the high
capacity market prices are not an effective signal for new entry but
instead a windfall for the owners of existing generation.”
</p>
<p>
Ironically, the high prices were due, in part, to PJM applying a formula
it typically reserves for renewables to coal and gas plants, which
“derates” the capacity they’re able to offer in times of stress,
e.g. during a winter storm.
<a href="https://www.in.gov/iurc/files/0-2024-6-6-IURC-Meeting-Resource-Adequacy-and-Accreditation-in-PJM.pdf" target="_blank">Historically</a>,
coal and gas got high ratings because high winds and cold temperatures
was considered unlikely to disrupt their production, while solar and
wind scored much lower. But after 2022’s Winter Storm Elliott, during
which natural gas lines froze and caused a mass blackout, PJM knocked
down the rating for combined cycle gas plants — the most efficient kind
of gas plant, which recaptures heat exhaust to produce more power — from
96% to 79%, and for combustion turbine natural gas plants from 90% to
62%. Wind got a bump, while solar was rated down.<span></span>
</p>
<p>
In other words, “PJM doesn’t view all these megawatts as reliably as
they did before Elliott,” Nicolas Freschi, a senior associate at Gabel
Associates, which does energy and environmental consulting for federal
agencies, told me. That meant some 26 gigawatts of projected coal and
gas capacity disappeared from the auction,
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/advocates-raise-concerns-about-lofty-pjm-auction-prices-83118153" target="_blank">according
to S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights</a>.
</p>
<p>
The environmental activist community has long argued that gas is less
reliable than utilities and the public seem to think it is, and that
this should be taken into account with grid planning. The gas derating
was “a good thing,” Claire Lang-Ree of the Natural Resources Defense
Council told me, “because that means what we’re paying for in this
auction is actually reliable. It’s a truing-up of the system.”
</p>
<p>
At the same time, she acknowledged, the auction result was “a bad thing
insofar as it was the driving cause of the price spike,” which also
means huge payouts for power companies.
</p>
<p>
“Despite the decrease in capacity credit, the higher capacity prices
will impact the capacity revenue received for projects in PJM, generally
increasing it,”
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/research/rising-pjm-capacity-prices-lift-returns-for-all-assets" target="_blank">S&amp;P
analysts wrote in August</a>. By way of example, S&amp;P looked at one
natural gas plant in Ohio and found that its project per-megawatt-hour
net revenue in 2026 would increase by 40%.
</p>
<p>
Morgan Stanley estimated that major power producers such as Texas-based
Vistra and Maryland’s Constellation Energy would see a boost to their
earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization of $700 million to
$800 million each.
</p>
<p>
And yet in both Texas and PJM, many analysts (not to mention the gas
industry) still see gas as the solution to a shortfall exacerbated by
gas’s documented vulnerability. That’s due to its ability — at least on
paper — to generate large amounts of power at any time of day.
</p>
<p>
So far, however, only one power producer with a large natural gas fleet,
Calpine, has
<a href="https://www.calpine.com/About-Us/News/CALPINE-ACCELERATES-PJM-DEVELOPMENT-PROGRAM" target="_blank">publicly
indicated</a> that it will aggressively pursue development in PJM.
Calpine operates a 76-facility fleet that includes 66 fossil fuel-fired
plants from California to Massachusetts. “The PJM market needs and
values reliable, dispatchable, non-duration-limited power” the company
said in a
<a href="https://www.calpine.com/About-Us/News/CALPINE-ACCELERATES-PJM-DEVELOPMENT-PROGRAM" target="_blank">press
release</a>. (These are all industry code words for natural gas.)
Calpine said it was “accelerating its PJM electricity generation
development program following market signals indicating higher demand
for reliable power,” and that it was looking at “multiple new locations
in the PJM region, particularly in Ohio and Pennsylvania.”
</p>
<p>
Other companies have been more cautious. “It is only one auction, of
course, and not long enough out in the future to be starting a new
project,” Vistra chief executive Jim Burke said in an August earnings
call. Morgan Stanley analysts noted that because the next auction is in
December, “we don’t foresee enough time to build significant new
generation capacity. There are only 18 months between the auction and
the start of the delivery year, which doesn’t leave time for permitting,
interconnection queue timing, and construction because they are behind.”
</p>
<p>
S&amp;P forecast that only one natural gas project under construction in
Ohio could possible bid into the next auction. And while stock and bond
analysts are more focused on the prospects for new natural gas plants,
they are not particularly optimistic they’ll come online any time soon.
“Merchant newbuilds remain marginal under our assumptions, indicating
price signals may need to improve further to incent merchant new entry,”
Guggenheim analyst Shahriar Pourreza wrote in a note.
</p>
<p>
Todd Snitchler, the head of the independent power generator trade group
Electric Power Supply Association, noted to me that the July auction
price was “coming off a record low,” and that the “abnormally” low
prices in the previous two auctions — which were then followed by a
lengthy delay — “suggested that assets should be leaving, and not coming
on” — a trend PJM and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/america-is-depending-on-renewables-this-summer" target="_self">other
electricity market overseers</a> have been warning about for years.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>“One auction does not make a trend make,” Snitchler said.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>If prices stay high, however, some analysts think power
producers will eventually start trying to build new natural gas plants
in PJM. “Investors don’t want to start building extremely expensive
projects until they’re sure this price environment is sustainable,”
Freschi told me.
</p>
<p>
Instead of beckoning new gas construction, clean energy and ratepayer
advocates want PJM to
<a href="https://opc.maryland.gov/Portals/0/Files/Publications/RMR%20Bill%20and%20Rates%20Impact%20Report_2024-08-14%20Final.pdf?ver=V9hZfyTmjLeNVt2Dg3cTgw%3d%3d" target="_blank">focus
on interconnection reform</a> so that its existing queue —
<a href="https://www.monitoringanalytics.com/reports/PJM_State_of_the_Market/2023/2023-som-pjm-vol2.pdf" target="_blank">which
is overwhelming renewables</a> — can finally make its way onto the grid.
<br/>
</p>
<p>
In a statement to Heatmap, PJM said its new system of evaluating
projects in groups instead of on a first-come, first-served basis will
lead to 230,000 megawatts being processed over the next three years. The
PJM spokesperson also pointed to Calpine’s announcement as a sign that
the capacity auction was bringing new investment.
</p>
<p>
“We need investment in real projects that can get connected to the grid
quickly, as opposed to the speculative projects that have clogged the
queue in the past,” the spokesperson said. “Our reformed interconnection
process encourages projects with the best chance of being built, and we
are weeding out some of those that have been hanging on for years past
receiving an interconnection agreement from PJM and who have not moved
to construction.”
</p>
<p>
“Generators should submit their new project queue positions today,” the
spokesperson added.
</p>
<p>
But like so many projects clogging the queue, these reforms are
speculative, and in the end the restructured market, where new supply
supposedly responds to high prices, simply may not work on its own
terms. Some of this is due to policy in PJM states — you’re unlikely to
be able to build a new natural gas plant in Democratic-controlled states
like Maryland, New Jersey, or Illinois, and Guggenheim’s Pourreza wrote
that “any new gas generation will be clustered in [Pennsylvania, Ohio,
and West Virginia],” which could both lead to lower capacity prices in
some areas and a more unbalanced market as new gas capacity becomes
concentrated geographically.
</p>
<p>
But even in areas that are famously friendly to fossil fuels and have
less complicated market and interconnection processes, demand for new
gas has not smoothly resulted in gas plant construction. In Texas, which
has closest thing to a free electricity market that exists in the United
States, the state has had to

to a multibillion low interest rate financing program</a> to entice
developers to build new natural gas plants.

<p>
May that be a warning to regional transmission planners everywhere. As
S&amp;P analysts wrote, “High prices signal the need for new generation,
but do not guarantee it.”

Transfer of ballistic missiles from Iran to Russia would be ‘dramatic
escalation’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The transfer of ballistic missiles from Iran to Russia
would signify a “dramatic escalation” of Tehran’s support for Moscow,
and the United States is prepared to respond with “significant
consequences,” the State Department said Monday. </p>
<p>U.S. media outlets reported last week that Washington believed Iran
had transferred the weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine, and the
European Union has said allies shared “credible” intelligence that
Tehran had done so. </p>
<p>“Any transfer of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia would represent
a dramatic escalation in Iran’s support for Russia’s war of aggression
against Ukraine,” State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel told
journalists. </p>
<p>“We have been clear … that we’re prepared to deliver significant
consequences,” he said. </p>
<p>Tehran has rejected the accusation that it transferred the missiles,
but the Kremlin has not explicitly denied it. </p>
<p>Faced with punishing Western sanctions, Moscow has turned to Iran and
North Korea for weapons supplies to keep its war machine going in
Ukraine. </p>
<p>Ukraine says it has been attacked with Iranian-designed Shahed drones
on an almost daily basis from Russia and has found fragments of North
Korean missiles on its territory. </p>
<p>The reported delivery of missiles to Russia comes as the Kremlin has
once again stepped up its bombing campaign against Ukraine’s key
infrastructure ahead of winter.</p>

<h2 id="blinken-arrives-in-london-on-week-of-us-uk-diplomacy">Blinken
arrives in London on week of US-UK diplomacy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>London — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived late Monday
in London at the start of a week of diplomacy with the new U.K.
government expected to touch on Ukraine and the Middle East. </p>
<p>Blinken’s visit comes ahead of a trip to Washington on Friday by
Prime Minister Keir Starmer, his second meeting at the White House since
his Labour Party won July elections, sweeping out the Conservatives
after 14 years. </p>
<p>Blinken — the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit London since
Labour’s triumph — is expected to meet Starmer and Foreign Secretary
David Lammy during his talks Tuesday. </p>
<p>The top U.S. diplomat will discuss Asia, the Middle East and “our
collective efforts to support Ukraine,” State Department spokesman
Matthew Miller said in a statement announcing Blinken’s trip. </p>
<p>The United States and Britain cooperate in lockstep on most global
issues, and Starmer has made clear that he will maintain the U.K. role
as one of the most assertive defenders of Ukraine as it pushes back
against the Russian invasion. </p>
<p>Former human rights lawyer Starmer, however, has taken a harder line
on Israel since taking office, with his government announcing a
suspension of some arms shipments, citing the risk that they could be
used to violate humanitarian law. </p>
<p>The Labour government has also dropped its Conservative predecessor’s
plans to challenge the right of the International Criminal Court to seek
the arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. </p>
<p>The United States is not a member of the ICC and has opposed the bid
to target Netanyahu, arguing that Israel has its own systems for
accountability. </p>
<p>But the United States, Israel’s primary weapons supplier, did not
criticize the U.K. arms decision, saying that Britain had its own
process to make assessments.</p>

charges 2 in Telegram terror plot against minorities, officials,
infrastructure</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Two people who prosecutors say were motivated by white
supremacist ideology have been arrested on charges that they used the
social media messaging app Telegram to encourage hate crimes and acts of
violence against minorities, government officials and critical
infrastructure in the United States, the Justice Department said
Monday.</p>
<p>The defendants, identified as Dallas Humber and Matthew Allison, face
15 federal counts in the Eastern District of California, including
charges that accuse them of soliciting hate crimes and the murder of
federal officials, distributing bombmaking instructions and conspiring
to provide material support to terrorists.</p>
<p>Humber, 34, of Elk Grove, California, and Allison, 37, of Boise,
Idaho were arrested Friday. Humber pleaded not guilty in a Sacramento
courtroom Monday to the charges. Her attorney Noa Oren declined to
comment on the case Monday afternoon after the arraignment.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear if Allison had an attorney who could
speak on his behalf.</p>
<p>The indictment accuses the two of leading Terrorgram, a network of
channels and group chats on Telegram, and of soliciting followers to
attack perceived enemies of white people, government buildings, energy
facilities and “high-value” targets such as politicians.</p>
<p>“Today’s action makes clear that the department will hold
perpetrators accountable, including those who hide behind computer
screens, in seeking to carry out bias-motivated violence,” Assistant
Attorney General Kristen Clarke, the Justice Department’s top civil
rights official, said at a news conference.</p>
<p>The pair’s exhortations to commit violence included statements such
as “Take Action Now” and “Do your part,” and users who carried out acts
to further white supremacism were told they could become known as
“Saints,” prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Justice Department officials say Humber and Allison used the app to
transmit bomb-making instructions and to distribute a list of potential
targets for assassination — including a federal judge, a senator and a
former U.S. attorney — and to celebrate acts or plots from active
Terrorgram users.</p>
<p>Those include the stabbing last month of five people outside a mosque
in Turkey and the July arrest of an 18-year-old accused of planning to
attack an electrical substation to advance white supremacist views. In
the Turkey attack, for instance, prosecutors say the culprit on the
morning of the stabbing posted in a group chat: “Come see how much
humans I can cleanse.”</p>
<p>A 24-minute documentary that the two had produced, “White Terror,”
documented and praised some 105 acts of white supremacist violence
between 1968 and 2021, according to the indictment.</p>
<p>“The risk and danger they present is extremely serious,” Assistant
Attorney General Matthew Olsen, the Justice Department’s top national
security official, said of Terrorgram users. He added, “Their reach is
as far as the internet because of the platform they’ve created.”</p>
<p>Telegram spokesman Remi Vaughn said: “Calls to violence have no place
on Telegram’s platform. Moderators removed several channels that used
variations of the ‘Terrorgram’ name when they were discovered years ago.
Similar content is banned whenever it appears.”</p>
<p>Telegram is a messaging app that allows for one-on-one conversations,
group chats and large “channels” that let people broadcast messages to
subscribers. Though broadly used as a messaging tool around the world,
Telegram has also drawn scrutiny, including a finding from French
investigators that the app has been used by Islamic extremists and drug
traffickers.</p>
<p>Telegram’s founder and CEO, Pavel Durov, was detained by French
authorities last month on charges of allowing the platform’s use for
criminal activity. Durov responded to the charges with a post last week
saying he shouldn’t have been targeted personally and by promising to
step up efforts to fight criminality on the app.</p>
<p>He wrote that while Telegram is not “some sort of anarchic paradise,”
surging numbers of users have “caused growing pains that made it easier
for criminals to abuse our platform.”</p>

id="americans-lost-5.6-billion-last-year-in-cryptocurrency-fraud-scams-fbi-says">Americans
lost $5.6 billion last year in cryptocurrency fraud scams, FBI says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Americans were duped out of more than $5.6 billion last
year through fraud schemes involving cryptocurrency, the FBI said in a
report released Monday that shows a 45% jump in losses from 2022. </p>
<p>The FBI received nearly 70,000 complaints in 2023 by victims of
financial fraud involving bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies,
according to the FBI. The most rampant scheme was investment fraud,
which accounted for $3.96 billion of the losses. </p>
<p>“The decentralized nature of cryptocurrency, the speed of
irreversible transactions, and the ability to transfer value around the
world make cryptocurrency an attractive vehicle for criminals, while
creating challenges to recover stolen funds,” wrote Michael Nordwall,
assistant director of the FBI’s criminal investigative division. </p>
<p>Scammers will often make contact through dating apps or social media
to build trust over several weeks or months before suggesting
cryptocurrency investing, the FBI said. Once the relationship is built,
they convince the targets to use fake websites or apps to invest their
money, sometimes even allowing the victims to withdraw small amounts of
money early on to make it seem legitimate. </p>
<p>In some cases, those victims are then targeted by bogus businesses
claiming they will help the victim recover the cryptocurrency they lost,
according to the FBI. </p>
<p>FBI officials say Americans of all ages can be a target of such
scams, and should be extremely cautious when presented with investment
opportunities from people they’ve never met in real life.</p>

<h2 id="redox-0.9.0-released">Redox 0.9.0 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s been two years, but we finally have a proper new Redox release:
the Redox team released version 0.9.0 today. Since we’ve been covering
all the monthly progress reports from this Rust-based operating system
for a long time now, we’ve already covered most of the improvements in
this new release, so if you’ve been following along there shouldn’t be
any major surprises in here, but let’s do a quick summary anyway just so
we’re all up to speed. I think the primary thing anyone moving from the
previous release to the new one will be massive performance and
stability improvements, as well as the arrival of the first few
applications from System76’s new COSMIC Desktop. Redox is led by Jeremy
Soller, a System76 engineer, and since COSMIC uses Rust as well, it only
makes sense for the two projects to start benefiting from each other’s
progress. Porting Linux and BSD programs has also become a lot easier,
which is also evidenced by a whole slew of new ports from those
operating systems. Redox works in both virtual machines and on real
hardware, but the former is definitely advised over the latter. In the
latest monthly progress report, which was published only a few days ago,
it’s mentioned that Redox performance in virtual machines has improved
greatly. The team discovered that reading the system time was a huge
bottleneck in the context switching code, which affects virtual machines
particularly hard because it needs to be read from outside oft he VM.
Redox now reads the TSC using KVM’s paravirtualized system time API to
remove this bottleneck. Running in a VM, Redox is now becoming slightly
faster than Linux at certain synthetic benchmarks, for example the
same-core context switch latency when using POSIX pipes (tested with
mitigations=off). More exciting optimizations are coming, both to reduce
context switch overhead further towards the hardware limit, and to
reduce unnecessary context switches overall. ↫ Ribbon and Ron Williams
As time moves on and both Redox and COSMIC improve, my excitement for
this operating system grows along with it. It seems the people working
on both projects have their priorities quite straight, and while I’m
obviously not going to make any idiotic grand statements about how Redox
will replace anything, I wouldn’t be surprised to see it become a fairly
solid option for those of us willing to deal with the issues that come
with running something that isn’t Windows, Linux/BSD, or macOS.</p>

US sign defense deal outlining ways to tackle regional crises</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>nicosia, cyprus — Cyprus and the United States have signed a defense
cooperation framework agreement that outlines ways the two countries can
enhance their response to regional humanitarian crises and security
concerns, including those arising from climate change.</p>
<p>Cyprus Defense Minister Vassilis Palmas and U.S. Assistant Secretary
of Defense for International Security Affairs Celeste Wallander hailed
the agreement Monday as another milestone in burgeoning Cypriot-U.S.
ties in recent years that saw the lifting in 2022 of a decades-old U.S.
arms embargo imposed on the east Mediterranean island nation.</p>
<p>“The Republic of Cyprus is a strong partner to the United States, in
Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean, and plays a pivotal role at the
nexus of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East,” Wallander said after
talks with Palmas.</p>
<p>The U.S. official praised Cyprus for acting as a haven for American
civilians evacuated from Sudan and Israel last year and for its key role
in setting up a maritime corridor to Gaza through which more than 20
million pounds of humanitarian aid has been shipped to the Palestinian
territory.</p>
<p>“It is evident that Cyprus is aligned with the West,” Wallander
said.</p>
<p>Palmas said Cyprus would continue building toward “closer, stronger
and beneficial bilateral defense cooperation with the United
States.”</p>
<p>According to a joint statement, the agreement also foresees working
together on dealing with “malicious actions” and bolstering ways for the
Cypriot military to operate more smoothly with U.S. forces.</p>

id="tropical-storm-francine-forms-off-mexico-expected-to-hit-louisiana-as-hurricane">Tropical
Storm Francine forms off Mexico, expected to hit Louisiana as
hurricane</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BATON ROUGE, Louisiana — Tropical Storm Francine formed in the Gulf
of Mexico on Monday and was expected to drench the Texas coast with rain
before coming ashore in Louisiana as a hurricane on Wednesday
night. </p>
<p>“We’re going to have a very dangerous situation developing by the
time we get into Wednesday for portions of the north-central Gulf Coast,
primarily along the coast of Louisiana, where we’re going to see the
potential for life-threatening storm surge inundation and hurricane
force winds,” said Michael Brennan, director of the U.S. National
Hurricane Center in Miami. </p>
<p>Heavy rain was already falling in northeastern Mexico and deep South
Texas, where some places could get up to 30 centimeters (11.8 inches)
into Monday night, Brennan said. </p>
<p>Francine is taking aim at a stretch of coastline that has yet to
fully recover since hurricanes Laura and Delta decimated Lake Charles,
Louisiana, in 2020, followed a year later by Hurricane Ida. Over the
weekend, a 22-story building in Lake Charles that had become a symbol of
the destruction was imploded after sitting vacant for nearly four years,
its windows shattered and covered in shredded tarps. </p>
<p>The storm surge pushed by Francine could reach as much as 3 meters
(10 feet) along a stretch of Louisiana coastline from Cameron to Port
Fourchon and into Vermilion Bay. And if the current track holds, the
storm could blow northward up the Mississippi River, into the Illinois
area by Saturday. </p>
<p>“Francine is expected to bring multiple days of heavy rainfall,
considerable flash flooding risk,” Brennan said. </p>
<p>Residents of Baton Rouge, Louisiana’s riverfront capital, began
forming long lines as people filled up their gas tanks and stocked up on
groceries. Others went to fill sandbags at city-operated locations to
try to keep floodwaters from entering their homes. </p>
<p>“It’s crucial that all of us take this storm very seriously and begin
our preparations immediately,” Baton Rouge Mayor-President Sharon Weston
Broome said during a news conference Monday morning. </p>
<p>She urged residents to prepare a disaster supply kit, complete with
enough food, water and essential supplies for three days. </p>
<p>The hurricane center said Monday morning that Francine was located
about 395 kilometers (245 miles) southeast of the mouth of the Rio
Grande, and about 770 kilometers (478 miles) south-southeast of Cameron,
Louisiana, sustaining top winds of about 85 kilometers (53 miles) per
hour. </p>
<p>The storm is expected to be centered just offshore through Tuesday,
and then intensify significantly from Tuesday night into Wednesday as it
nears the upper Texas coast and Louisiana, according to the hurricane
center. </p>
<p>A storm surge watch has been issued from just east of Galveston,
Texas, to the Mississippi-Alabama border, while a hurricane watch has
been issued for much of the Louisiana coast, from Cameron to Grand
Isle.</p>

id="freed-from-russian-jail-american-journalist-is-focused-on-colleagues-still-imprisoned">Freed
from Russian jail, American journalist is focused on colleagues still
imprisoned</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Being able to open a door whenever she wants is one of
the many freedoms Alsu Kurmasheva is enjoying after months of wrongful
detention in Russia.</p>
<p>“I’m enjoying freedom. I’m loving every minute of it,” the American
journalist told VOA, just a few weeks after she was freed as part of a
historic prisoner swap between the United States and Russia.</p>
<p>An editor with VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in
Prague, Kurmasheva was back in Washington late last month to accept an
award from the National Press Club. The visit was the start of what she
described as her “thank you tour.”</p>
<p>A dual U.S.-Russian national, Kurmasheva traveled to Russia in May
2023 to visit her ailing mother in the Tatarstan city of Kazan. But
authorities blocked her from leaving and later jailed her for more than
nine months on bogus charges.</p>
<p>“What happened to me was so wrong, and it shouldn’t happen to any
innocent person. It shouldn’t happen to any journalist,” Kurmasheva
said. “I was jailed for 288 days, and every minute of it is suffering.
It’s going through humiliation. And inmates in Russia and Belarus, they
don’t have any rights.”</p>
<p>In prison, daily life was monotonous for Kurmasheva. “It was
endless,” she said, adding that she forced herself to remain
optimistic.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t write in my letters to my mom or to my husband or family
or friends that I was falling apart, that I was collapsing, because I
knew they were trying so hard to get me out,” she said.</p>
<p>Letters that she received from supporters from all over the world
helped, said Kurmasheva, holding up some of the postcards she received
from supporters in New York and Oregon.</p>
<p>“When my spirit was really low, I just opened my cards and letters,
and I kept reading them,” she said.</p>
<p>At one point during her detention, Kurmasheva shared a cell with nine
other women. There was more social interaction, she said, but that
didn’t make the situation any easier.</p>
<p>“The doors were still locked, and every woman was there with her own
bad luck and uncertain future,” she said.</p>
<p>When it was time for Kurmasheva’s release, her captors obscured that
she was being freed, telling the journalist she was heading to a
destination other than Moscow.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until she was hugging her husband and daughters at Joint
Base Andrews outside Washington that reality set in. “Only then I felt
it was real,” Kurmasheva said. “That was the moment I was dreaming of
for months and months.”</p>
<p>Before returning home to Prague, Kurmasheva went to a military base
in Texas, where she received care from doctors and psychologists.</p>
<p>The recovery process after wrongful detention varies greatly from
person to person, according to Katherine Porterfield, a consulting
psychologist at the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma in New
York.</p>
<p>“The experience of incarceration is one of loss of liberty, loss of
agency, loss of freedom of movement, as well as lots of other
disconnections,” Porterfield told VOA, speaking generally about how
journalists and others are helped after a wrongful detention.</p>
<p>“It’s basically moving a person from powerlessness to a sense of
agency again,” Porterfield said.</p>
<p>Throughout Kurmasheva’s imprisonment, press freedom groups criticized
the State Department for not declaring her wrongfully detained. The
designation — which The Wall Street Journal’s Gershkovich received
within two weeks of his arrest — opens up extra resources and support
for families and commits the U.S. government to secure their
release.</p>
<p>The State Department in August said it had declared Kurmasheva
wrongfully detained shortly before the prisoner swap took place.</p>
<p>“If any journalist is detained anywhere in the world doing their job,
they should immediately be designated as wrongfully detained,”
Kurmasheva said.</p>
<p>Kurmasheva’s own freedom feels bittersweet, she admits. At the top of
her mind are her three RFE/RL colleagues who are still unjustly
jailed.</p>
<p>Andrey Kuznechyk and Ihar Losik are jailed in Belarus, and Vladyslav
Yesypenko is jailed in Russian-occupied Crimea. RFE/RL has condemned all
three cases as politically motivated.</p>
<p>Kurmasheva isn’t sure whether she wants to stick with journalism or
try something new, she said, but she does know that she wants to help
free her jailed colleagues and other political prisoners.</p>
<p>“I feel the pain that their families are going through,” she said. “I
feel the pain of those journalists.”</p>
<p>With Kurmasheva’s own family, she takes every opportunity to thank
her daughters, as well as her husband, for fighting so hard to secure
her release.</p>
<p>“They were the leaders of my advocacy group. It all started at home,”
she said.</p>
<p>Noting how her daughters have matured significantly in the time
Kurmasheva was in jail, she says she is relishing her newly reclaimed
freedom and figuring out what comes next.</p>

attend funeral for American activist witness says was shot dead by
Israeli troops</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NABLUS, West Bank — The Western-backed Palestinian Authority held a
funeral procession Monday for a U.S.-Turkish dual national activist who
a witness says was shot and killed by Israeli forces while demonstrating
against settlements in the occupied West Bank. </p>
<p>Dozens of mourners — including several leading PA officials —
attended the procession. Security forces carried the body of Aysenur
Ezgi Eygi which was draped in a Palestinian flag while a traditional
black-and-white checkered scarf covered her face. The 26-year-old’s body
was then placed into the back of a Palestinian ambulance. </p>
<p>Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman Oncu Keceli said Turkey was
working on repatriating Eygi’s remains for burial in the Aegean coastal
town of Didim as per her family’s wishes, but “because the land crossing
from the Palestinian territories to Jordan was closed as of Sunday, the
ministry was trying to have the body flown directly to Turkey.” </p>
<p>U.S. officials did not respond to a request for comment. </p>
<p>Jonathan Pollak, an Israeli peace activist who participated in
Friday’s protest, said Israeli forces shot her on Friday in the city of
Nablus while posing no threat, adding that the killing happened during a
period of calm after clashes between soldiers and Palestinian
protesters. Pollak said he then saw two Israeli soldiers mount the roof
of a nearby home, train a gun in the group’s direction and fired, with
one of the bullets striking Eygi in the head. </p>
<p>The Israeli military said it was looking into reports that troops had
killed a foreign national while firing at an “instigator of violent
activity” in the area of the protest. </p>
<p>The West Bank has seen a surge of violence since the Israel-Hamas war
began in October, with increasing Israeli raids, attacks by Palestinian
militants on Israelis, and attacks by Israeli settlers on
Palestinians.</p>

faces new antitrust trial after ruling declaring search engine a
monopoly</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ALEXANDRIA, Va. — One month after a judge declared Google’s search
engine an illegal monopoly, the tech giant faces another antitrust
lawsuit that threatens to break up the company, this time over its
advertising technology.</p>
<p>The Justice Department and a coalition of states contend that Google
built and maintains a monopoly over the technology that matches online
publishers to advertisers. Dominance over the software on both the buy
side and the sell side of the transaction enables Google to keep as much
as 36 cents on the dollar when it brokers sales between publishers and
advertisers, the government contends in court papers.</p>
<p>Google says the government’s case is based on an internet of
yesteryear, when desktop computers ruled and internet users carefully
typed precise World Wide Web addresses into URL fields. Advertisers now
are more likely to turn to social media companies like TikTok or
streaming TV services like Peacock to reach audiences.</p>
<p>In recent years, Google Networks, the division of the Mountain View,
California-based tech giant that includes such services as AdSense and
Google Ad Manager that are at the heart of the case, actually have seen
declining revenue, from $31.7 billion in 2021 to $31.3 billion in 2023,
according to the company’s annual reports.</p>
<p>The trial over the alleged ad tech monopoly begins Monday in
Alexandria, Virginia. It initially was going to be a jury trial, but
Google maneuvered to force a bench trial, writing a check to the federal
government for more than $2 million to moot the only claim brought by
the government that required a jury.</p>
<p>The case will now be decided by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema,
who was appointed to the bench by former President Bill Clinton and is
best known for high-profile terrorism trials including Sept. 11
defendant Zacarias Moussaoui. Brinkema, though, also has experience with
highly technical civil trials, working in a courthouse that sees an
outsize number of patent infringement cases.</p>
<p>The Virginia case comes on the heels of a major defeat for Google
over its search engine. which generates the majority of the company’s
$307 billion in annual revenue. A judge in the District of Columbia
declared the search engine a monopoly, maintained in part by tens of
billions of dollars Google pays each year to companies like Apple to
lock in Google as the default search engine presented to consumers when
they buy iPhones and other gadgets.</p>
<p>In that case, the judge has not yet imposed any remedies. The
government hasn’t offered its proposed sanctions, though there could be
close scrutiny over whether Google should be allowed to continue to make
exclusivity deals that ensure its search engine is consumers’ default
option.</p>
<p>Peter Cohan, a professor of management practice at Babson College,
said the Virginia case could potentially be more harmful to Google
because the obvious remedy would be requiring it to sell off parts of
its ad tech business that generate billions of dollars in annual
revenue.</p>
<p>“Divestitures are definitely a possible remedy for this second case,”
Cohan said “It could be potentially more significant than initially
meets the eye.”</p>
<p>In the Virginia trial, the government’s witnesses are expected to
include executives from newspaper publishers including The New York
Times Co. and Gannett, and online news sites that the government
contends have faced particular harm from Google’s practices.</p>
<p>“Google extracted extraordinary fees at the expense of the website
publishers who make the open internet vibrant and valuable,” government
lawyers wrote in court papers. “As publishers generate less money from
selling their advertising inventory, publishers are pushed to put more
ads on their websites, to put more content behind costly paywalls, or to
cease business altogether.”</p>
<p>Google disputes that it charges excessive fees compared to its
competitors. The company also asserts the integration of its technology
on the buy side, sell side and in the middle assures ads and web pages
load quickly and enhance security. And it says customers have options to
work with outside ad exchanges.</p>
<p>Google says the government’s case is improperly focused on display
ads and banner ads that load on web pages accessed through a desktop
computer and fails to take into account consumers’ migration to mobile
apps and the boom in ads placed on social media sites over the last 15
years.</p>
<p>The government’s case “focuses on a limited type of advertising
viewed on a narrow subset of websites when user attention migrated
elsewhere years ago,” Google’s lawyers write in a pretrial filing. “The
last year users spent more time accessing websites on the ‘open web,’
rather than on social media, videos, or apps, was 2012.”</p>
<p>The trial, which is expected to last several weeks, is taking place
in a courthouse that rigidly adheres to traditional practices, including
a resistance to technology in the courtroom. Cellphones are banned from
the courthouse, to the chagrin of a tech press corps accustomed at the
District of Columbia trial to tweeting out live updates as they
happen.</p>
<p>Even the lawyers, and there are many on both sides, are limited in
their technology. At a pretrial hearing Wednesday, Google’s lawyers made
a plea to be allowed more than the two computers each side is permitted
to have in the courtroom during trial. Brinkema rejected it.</p>
<p>“This is an old-fashioned courtroom,” she said.</p>

the sharks to leave for extended periods of time. Their absence could

greater energy to remain cool or stay on a reef in suboptimal conditions

id="authorities-vow-relentless-search-as-manhunt-for-interstate-shooter-enters-third-day-in-kentucky">Authorities
vow relentless search as manhunt for interstate shooter enters third day
in Kentucky</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LONDON, Ky. — As a grueling manhunt stretched into a third day Monday
for a suspect in an interstate shooting that struck 12 vehicles and
wounded five people, authorities vowed to keep up a relentless search as
the stress level remained high for a rural area where some schools
canceled classes.</p>
<p>Authorities have been searching a rugged, hilly area of southeastern
Kentucky since Saturday evening, when a gunman began shooting at drivers
on Interstate 75 near London, a small city of about 8,000 people located
about 75 miles (120 kilometers) south of Lexington.</p>
<p>The search was temporarily suspended once darkness fell Sunday night,
but was set to resume Monday morning.</p>
<p>“We’re not going to quit until we do lay hands on him,” Laurel County
Sheriff John Root said Sunday night.</p>
<p>Joseph A. Couch, 32, was named first as a person of interest and
later as a suspect in the shooting after authorities said they recovered
his SUV on a service road near the crime scene. They later found a
semi-automatic weapon nearby that they believe was used in the shooting,
said Deputy Gilbert Acciardo, a spokesperson for the local sheriff’s
office.</p>
<p>On Sunday, as another day of searching was ending without any sign of
the suspect, Acciardo acknowledged the frustration that law enforcement
officers and people who live near the search area are feeling.</p>
<p>“As this continues, it becomes more stressful for the community, it
becomes more stressful for the officers that are there because we’re
looking … and we’re trying to find him, and we haven’t found him,” he
said.</p>
<p>State police Master Trooper Scottie Pennington, a spokesman for the
London state police post, said troopers are being brought in from around
the state to aid the manhunt. He described the extensive search area as
“walking in a jungle” with machetes needed to cut through thickets of
woods.</p>
<p>Acciardo said it appears that the attacker planned the shooting for
that location because it is very remote and the terrain is hilly, rocky
and hard to navigate.</p>
<p>With the gunman still at large, numerous area school districts
canceled classes for Monday. Pennington urged area residents to lock
doors, keep porch lights on and monitor security cameras. The search was
focused on a remote area about eight miles north of London.</p>
<p>Authorities sought to reassure residents that they believe the
suspect will be found.</p>
<p>“We’re doing everything that we can do,” Root said, adding, ”Just be
confident.”</p>
<p>Authorities said Couch purchased the weapon and about 1,000 rounds of
ammunition Saturday morning in London. Couch has a military background,
having served in the National Guard for at least four years, said
Capt. Richard Dalrymple of the Laurel County Sheriff’s Office.</p>
<p>Authorities initially said nine vehicles were struck by gunfire, but
later increased that number to 12, saying some people did not realize
their cars had been hit by bullets until they arrived home. They said
the gunman fired a total of 20 to 30 rounds.</p>
<p>Couch most recently lived in Woodbine, a small community about 20
miles (32 kilometers) south of the shooting scene. Acciardo said
authorities found his abandoned vehicle Saturday and then an AR-15 rifle
on Sunday in a wooded area near a highway where “he could have shot down
upon the interstate.” A phone believed to be Couch’s was also found by
law enforcement, but the battery had been taken out.</p>
<p>Some residents of Laurel County were on edge as authorities searched
with a drone, helicopter and on foot in a remote and sparsely populated
wooded area near the busy interstate.</p>
<p>Cody Shepherd, sipping a bloody mary outdoors while waiting to watch
a football game at the Pour Boyz Sports Lounge in London on Sunday, said
locals were abuzz with speculation. A resident of London, he was at a
party Saturday at a friend’s house about 10 miles (16 kilometers) south
of where the shooting occurred.</p>
<p>“We were listening to the police scanners all night,” he said, adding
they heard sirens and saw a helicopter overhead.</p>
<p>On Sunday, several local churches canceled services. But Rodney
Goodlett, pastor of Faith Assembly of God in London, was helping direct
traffic as parishioners gathered for a morning service. He expected the
search would hold down attendance.</p>
<p>“This is tragic, obviously, that somebody would randomly do violent
acts,” he said. “You hear media things taking place all around our
country, but then when it hits home, it’s a little bit of a wake-up
call.”</p>
<p>Acciardo said authorities are being inundated with tips from the
public and are following up on each one in case it could help them find
the shooter. When the search has been suspended at night, specially
trained officers have been deployed in strategic locations in the woods
to prevent the gunman from slipping out of the area.</p>
<p>“We’ve got to get him,” Acciardo said.</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
After a rough year, Boeing was facing a possible strike to add to its
list of problems. But no longer. The aerospace company has reached a
tentative deal with its largest labor union, with the hopes of averting
a strike. We’ll hear more. Plus, Vice President Kamala Harris and former
President Donald Trump are set to square off in their first debate
tomorrow evening. We’ll do some math on their fiscal proposals.

id="a-911-anniversary-tradition-is-handed-down-to-a-new-generation">A
9/11 anniversary tradition is handed down to a new generation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — A poignant phrase echoes when 9/11 victims’ relatives
gather each year to remember the loved ones they lost in the terror
attacks.</p>
<p>“I never got to meet you.”</p>
<p>It is the sound of generational change at ground zero, where
relatives read out victims’ names on every anniversary of the attacks.
Nearly 3,000 people were killed when al-Qaida hijackers crashed four
jetliners into the twin towers, the Pentagon and a field in southwest
Pennsylvania on Sept. 11, 2001.</p>
<p>Some names are read out by children or young adults who were born
after the strikes. Last year’s observance featured 28 such young people
among more than 140 readers. Young people are expected again at this
year’s ceremony Wednesday.</p>
<p>Some are the children of victims whose partners were pregnant. More
of the young readers are victims’ nieces, nephews or grandchildren. They
have inherited stories, photos, and a sense of solemn
responsibility.</p>
<p>Being a “9/11 family” reverberates through generations, and
commemorating and understanding the Sept. 11 attacks one day will be up
to a world with no first-hand memory of them.</p>
<p>“It’s like you’re passing the torch on,” says Allan Aldycki, 13.</p>
<p>He read the names of his grandfather and several other people the
last two years, and plans to do so on Wednesday. Aldycki keeps mementoes
in his room from his grandfather Allan Tarasiewicz, a firefighter.</p>
<p>The teen told the audience last year that he’s heard so much about
his grandfather that it feels like he knew him, “but still, I wish I had
a chance to really know you,” he added.</p>
<p>Allan volunteered to be a reader because it makes him feel closer to
his grandfather, and he hopes to have children who’ll participate.</p>
<p>“It’s an honor to be able to teach them because you can let them know
their heritage and what to never forget,” he said by phone from central
New York. He said he already finds himself teaching peers who know
little or nothing about 9/11.</p>
<p>When it comes time for the ceremony, he looks up information about
the lives of each person whose name he’s assigned to read.</p>
<p>“He reflects on everything and understands the importance of what it
means to somebody,” his mother, Melissa Tarasiewicz, said.</p>
<p>Reciting the names of the dead is a tradition that extends beyond
ground zero. War memorials honor fallen military members by speaking
their names aloud. Some Jewish organizations host readings of Holocaust
victims’ names on the international day of remembrance, Yom Hashoah.</p>
<p>The names of the 168 people killed in the 1995 bombing of a federal
building in Oklahoma City are read annually at the memorial there.</p>
<p>On Sept. 11 anniversaries, the Pentagon’s ceremony includes military
members or officials reading the names of the 184 people killed there.
The Flight 93 National Memorial has victims’ relatives and friends read
the list of the 40 passengers and crew members whose lives ended at the
rural site near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The hourslong observance at the 9/11 Memorial in New York is almost
exclusively dedicated to the names of the 2,977 victims at all three
sites, plus the six people killed in the 1993 World Trade Center
bombing. All are read by relatives who volunteer and are chosen by
lottery.</p>
<p>Each is given a subset of names to render aloud. Readers also
generally speak briefly about their own lost kin, frequently in touching
detail.</p>
<p>“I think often about how, if you were still here, you would be one of
my best friends, looking at colleges with me, getting me out of trouble
with Mom and Dad, hanging out at the Jersey Shore,” Capri Yarosz said
last year of her slain uncle, New York firefighter Christopher Michael
Mozzillo.</p>
<p>Now 17, she grew up with a homemade baby book about him and a family
that still mentions him in everyday conversation.</p>
<p>“Chris would have loved that” is a phrase often heard around the
house.</p>
<p>She has read twice at the trade center ceremony.</p>
<p>“It means a lot to me that I can kind of keep alive my uncle’s name
and just keep reading everybody else’s name, so that more of the
upcoming generations will know,” she said by phone from her family’s
home in central New Jersey. “I feel good that I can pass down the
importance of what happened.”</p>
<p>Her two younger sisters also have read names, and one is preparing to
do so again Wednesday. Their mother, Pamela Yarosz, has never been able
to steel herself to sign up.</p>
<p>“I don’t have that strength. It’s too hard for me,” says Pamela
Yarosz, who is Mozzillo’s sister. “They’re braver.”</p>
<p>By now, many of the children of 9/11 victims — such as Melissa
Tarasiewicz, who was just out of high school when her father died — have
long since grown up. But about 100 were born after the attacks killed
one of their parents, and are now young adults.</p>
<p>“Though we never met, I am honored to carry your name and legacy with
me. I thank you for giving me this life and family,” Manuel DaMota
Jr. said of his father, a woodworker and project manager, during last
year’s ceremony.</p>
<p>One young reader after another at the event commemorated aunts,
uncles, great-uncles, grandfathers and grandmothers whom the children
have missed throughout their lives.</p>
<p>“My whole life, my dad has said I reminded him of you.”</p>
<p>“I wish you got to take me fishing.”</p>
<p>“I wish I had more of you than just a picture on a frame.”</p>
<p>“Even though I never got to meet you, I will never forget you.”</p>

<h2 id="linuxs-bedtime-routine">Linux’s bedtime routine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>How does Linux move from an awake machine to a hibernating one? How
does it then manage to restore all state? These questions led me to read
way too much C in trying to figure out how this particular
hardware/software boundary is navigated. ↫ Jacob Adams So this is a lot
deeper of a dive than I expected, and it blows my mind just how complex
sleep, hibernating, and waking a computer really is. Instinctively you
know this, but seeing it spelled out like this really drives that point
home – and this only covers going into hibernation. It also highlights
how hard it must be for the developers involved to keep this working at
all, especially on the wide variety of machines and hardware
combinations Linux runs on. It wasn’t too log ago that pretty much the
only platform where sleeping and waking worked reliably was Mac OS X
with its controlled, small hardware selection, so it’s kind of
remarkable this works at all on Linux now. I haven’t had to worry about
sleeping and waking with Linux for quite a while now, and it’s one of
those things that “just works” so I never have to think about it. This
definitely wasn’t always the case, though, and on both Linux and Windows
I would just turn the whole feature off since it rarely worked reliably,
especially on desktops. I’m sure it still breaks for people, but for me,
it’s been rock solid, and reading through the linked article, I’m even
more amazed about this than I already was.</p>

focus on improving developer experience, input methods</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>The KDE project is currently having its yearly conference – Akademy –
and at the conference, the project announced its goals for the coming
years. The KDE community has charted its course for the coming years,
focusing on three interconnected paths that converge on a single point:
community. These paths aim to improve user experience, support
developers, and foster community growth. ↫ Farid Abdelnour on the KDE
Blogs First, the project intends to make it easier for developers to
build KDE applications. They want to do this in various ways, but most
notably they want to improve the developer experience for people writing
KDE applications in languages other than C++, such as Rust or Python.
This is a very welcome goal, as I feel there’s definitely a bit of a
lack of new KDE applications, and as any other open source project, KDE
can always use more developers. Second, KDE is going to focus on
improving the input experience, as in the various ways you interact with
your computer. Accessibility, and the more complex input methods people
with accessibility needs require, are also part of this goal, but it
also covers simpler things like mice with tons of buttons, drawing
tablets, 2-in-1 laptops, and so on. I’m assuming this also includes
controlling the various RGB stuff found in every keyboard and mouse
these days, as this is something KDE has already been making inroads
into. The third and final goal is one strongly related to the first
goal, as it involves community outreach to attract new contributors.
This covers not just individual contributors, but also support from
institutions, organisations, and I’m guessing companies, too. With Valve
opting for KDE for its Steam Deck, I wouldn’t be surprised to see some
more involvement from that direction, too, which meshes well with the
input goal mentioned above. If you all keep becoming Patreons and
donating to us, I might be able to actually go to Akademy next year and
be a fly on the wall for some more in-depth reporting from such a
conference. I can’t guarantee anything – especially since I have two
small children, live far away from everything here in the Arctic, and
have serious anxiety problems to take into account, but it’s definitely
a goal for me for next year.</p>

id="us-congress-takes-up-a-series-of-bills-targeting-china-from-drones-to-drugs">US
Congress takes up a series of bills targeting China, from drones to
drugs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — How to curb and counter China’s influence and power —
through its biotech companies, drones and electric vehicles — will
dominate the U.S. House’s first week back from summer break, with
lawmakers taking up a series of measures targeting Beijing.</p>
<p>Washington views Beijing as its biggest geopolitical rival, and the
legislation is touted as ensuring the U.S. prevails in the competition.
Many of the bills scheduled for a vote this week appear to have both
Republican and Democratic support, reflecting strong consensus that
congressional actions are needed to counter China.</p>
<p>The legislation “will take meaningful steps to counter the military,
economic and ideological threat of the Chinese Communist Party,” said
Rep. John Moolenaar, chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese
Communist Party and a Michigan Republican. “There’s a bipartisan goal to
win this competition.”</p>
<p>Advocacy groups worry about the impact, warning against rhetoric that
hurts Asian Americans and could create “an atmosphere of guilt by
association or fuel divisiveness,” said Christine Chen, executive
director of Asian &amp; Pacific Islander American Vote.</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington called the legislation “new
McCarthyism” that hypes the tensions in an election year. If passed, the
bills “will cause serious interference to China-U.S. relations and
mutually beneficial cooperation, and will inevitably damage the U.S.’s
own interests, image and credibility,” spokesman Liu Pengyu said in a
statement.</p>
<p>Among the bills are efforts to reduce U.S. reliance on Chinese
biotech companies, ban Chinese EVs and drones, restrict Chinese
nationals from buying farmland, toughen export restrictions and revive a
program to root out spying on U.S. intellectual property.</p>
<p>If approved, the measures would still need to clear the Senate.
Here’s a look at the key legislation:</p>
<p>Targeting Beijing-linked biotech</p>
<p>A bill seeks to ban a group of five biotechnology companies with
Chinese ties from working with anyone that receives federal money.</p>
<p>The companies include those that work to help doctors detect genetic
causes for cancer or do research and manufacturing for American
drugmakers, considered a key step in developing new medications.</p>
<p>America’s biotech companies have said the bill would disrupt their
partnerships with Chinese contractors, resulting in delays in clinical
trials for new drugs and higher costs.</p>
<p>Supporters say the legislation is necessary to protect U.S. health
care data and reduce the country’s reliance on China for its medical
supply chain.</p>
<p>“American patients cannot be in a position where we rely on China for
genomic testing or basic medical supplies,” said Rep. Brad Wenstrup, an
Ohio Republican who sponsored the bill. He called it “the first step” in
protecting Americans’ genetic data.</p>
<p>BGI, one of the Chinese companies named in the bill, called it “a
false flag targeting companies under the premise of national security.”
The company, which offers genetic sequencing for research purposes in
the U.S., said it follows the law and has no access to Americans’
personal data.</p>
<p>Banning Chinese drones</p>
<p>Another bill would dub drones made by the Chinese company DJI, which
dominates the global drone market, “an unacceptable risk to U.S.
national security” and cut its products from U.S. communications
networks over data security concerns.</p>
<p>The bill would protect Americans’ data and critical infrastructure,
said Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, who introduced it.
“Congress must use every tool at our disposal to stop” China’s
“monopolistic control over the drone market,” she said.</p>
<p>DJI argues that users have to “opt in” to share data such as flight
logs, photos and videos with the company. If users don’t do so, the
company said it won’t have data to share with any government when
compelled. It also has rejected allegations that it is a Chinese
military company and has aided the persecution of members of ethnic
Muslim minorities.</p>
<p>Adam Bry, co-founder and CEO of major U.S. drone maker Skydio, told a
congressional committee in June about losing business to China, where
“the Chinese government has tried to control the drone industry, pouring
resources into national champions and taking aim at competitors in the
U.S. and the West, tilting the playing field in China’s favor.”</p>
<p>Protecting intellectual property</p>
<p>A challenge is likely against an attempt to revive a Trump-era
program described as a way to stop Chinese efforts to steal intellectual
property and spy on industry and research.</p>
<p>The bill would direct the Justice Department to curb spying by
Beijing on U.S. intellectual property and academic institutions and go
after people engaged in theft of trade secrets, hacking and economic
espionage.</p>
<p>The Trump-era program, called the China Initiative, ended in 2022
after multiple unsuccessful prosecutions of researchers and concerns
that it had prompted racial and ethnic profiling. Critics also say it
chilled cooperation between the U.S. and China in science and technology
meant to benefit the greater good.</p>
<p>“Our colleagues in the Republican Party sought to reinstate this
failed program because they wanted to look like they were solving
problems. But in reality, they were only stoking fear and hatred,”
several Democratic lawmakers said in a statement in March, when they
fought off another effort to restart the program.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Restricting farm sales</p>
<p>Another bill, which says it will protect U.S. farmland from foreign
adversaries, has raised concerns about discrimination.</p>
<p>It would add the agriculture secretary to the U.S. Committee on
Foreign Investment, which reviews the national security implications of
foreign transactions. The bill also flags as “reportable” land sales
involving citizens from China, North Korea, Russia and Iran.</p>
<p>“Food security is national security, and for too long, the federal
government has allowed the Chinese Communist Party to put our security
at risk by turning a blind eye to their steadily increasing purchases of
American farmland,” said Rep. Dan Newhouse, a Republican from Washington
state, who introduced the bill.</p>
<p>The National Agricultural Law Center estimates 24 states ban or limit
foreigners without residency and foreign businesses or governments from
owning private farmland. The interest emerged after a Chinese
billionaire bought more than 130,000 acres near a U.S. Air Force base in
Texas and another Chinese company sought to build a corn plant near an
Air Force base in North Dakota.</p>

that sparked change</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Joe Biden’s poor performance during the debate against
Donald Trump in June led to his withdrawal from the race and the
elevation of Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.
Here’s a look at other presidential debates in history that shifted the
direction of the campaign.</p>

fault Biden administration in new report about Afghanistan
withdrawal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Republicans on a U.S. House of Representatives committee
issued a report Sunday criticizing the Biden administration for the
chaotic August 2021 U.S. military and diplomatic withdrawal from
Afghanistan after a nearly 20-year war.</p>
<p>The report faulted President Joe Biden for failing to “mitigate the
likely consequences of the decision” to withdraw, while ignoring
warnings that Taliban fighters were seizing key cities in Afghanistan
faster than U.S. officials expected. </p>
<p>In the last days of the withdrawal, a suicide bombing attack by an
Islamic State terrorist killed 13 U.S. soldiers and about 170 Afghan
civilians at the Kabul airport. Many Afghans clinging to the
underbellies of departing aircraft leaving Afghanistan fell to their
deaths.  </p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump initiated the withdrawal process in
February 2020 by signing an agreement with the Taliban, a pact that
Biden honored as he looked to end America’s longest war.</p>
<p>The fateful withdrawal also played a role in Biden’s political
fortunes. Until that time, Americans in national surveys approved of
Biden’s performance during the first seven months of his presidency.</p>
<p>But his approval rating dipped into negative territory after the
chaotic troop withdrawal and the deaths of the 13 soldiers and has never
again advanced into a favorable standing.  </p>
<p>The report from Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee
followed a three-year investigation and includes accusations that the
Biden administration did not have adequate plans or security in place to
safely carry out the withdrawal.  </p>
<p>Committee Chairman Michael McCaul said the Biden administration “had
the information and opportunity to take necessary steps to plan for the
inevitable collapse of the Afghan government, so we could safely
evacuate U.S. personnel, American citizens, green card holders, and our
brave Afghan allies.”   </p>
<p>Previous investigations have faulted multiple U.S. administrations,
including a 2023 report by the U.S. government watchdog for the U.S. in
Afghanistan which cited both Trump’s and Biden’s determination to go
forward with the withdrawal despite the Taliban breaking key commitments
the militants made in the 2020 agreement.   </p>
<p>Congressman Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the committee, said in
a letter to colleagues that Republicans “cherry-picked witness testimony
to exclude anything unhelpful to a predetermined, partisan narrative
about the Afghanistan withdrawal.”  </p>
<p>In a lengthy statement, the U.S. State Department said, “There are
valid and important criticisms of the two-decade-long war in Afghanistan
and how it concluded.” But the country’s top diplomatic agency said it
“has remained focused on evolving and growing from this moment, learning
important lessons and making sustainable changes to crisis
operations.”</p>
<p>The State Department said the U.S. government successfully evacuated
120,000 Americans, Afghans, and third-country nationals from Afghanistan
in the final two weeks of August 2021 and has resettled 165,000 Afghans
across the U.S.</p>
<p>The State Department said it “stands ready to work alongside”
lawmakers who have a “serious interest” in finding legislative and
administrative solutions to avoid the chaos of the withdrawal from the
Afghan war zone. But the State  Department said it would “not stand by
silently” as the agency and “its workforce are used to further partisan
agendas.” </p>

Agence France-Presse and Reuters.</p>

<h2 id="risc-laptops-of-the-90s-and-early-2000s">RISC Laptops of the 90s
and early 2000s</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Paul Weissmann’s OpenPA, the invaluable archive on anything related
to the HP’s PA-RISC architecture, devices, and operating systems, has
branched off for a bit and started collecting information on RISC
laptops. Technical computing in the 1990s was mostly done on RISC
workstations with Unix operating systems and specialized applications.
For mobile use cases, some of the popular RISC vendors built RISC
Laptops for mobile Unix use in the 1990s. Often based on contemporary
Unix workstations, these RISC laptops were often marketed for government
and military uses such as command, technical analysis and surveillance.
↫ Paul Weissmann at OpenPA OpenPA has always had content beyond just
PA-RISC (like HP’s Itanium machines), so this is not entirely
surprising, and it also happens to be something that’s sorely needed –
there’s remarkably little consolidated information to be found on these
RISC laptops, and it’s usually scattered all over the place and
difficult to find. They were expensive and rare when they were new, and
they’re even rarer and often more expensive today. What we’re talking
about here are laptops with PA-RISC, SPARC, (non-Apple) PowerPC, and
Alpha processors, running some variant of UNIX, like HP-UX,
SunOS/Solaris, AIX, and even Windows NT. A particularly interesting
listing at the moment is the Hitachi 3050RX/100C, a laptop based on the
Hitachi PA/50L PA-RISC processor that ran something called HI-UX/WE2, a
UNIX from Hitachi I can’t find much information about. The most
desirable laptop listed is the amazing Tadpole Viper, which was the most
powerful SPARC laptop Tadpole ever made, and I’m pretty sure it’s the
most powerful SPARC laptop, period. It was powered by a 1.2Ghz
UltraSPARC IIIi processor, and was also sold as the Sun Ultra 3, in
2005. I would perform some seriously questionable acts to get my hands
on one of these, but they’re most likely virtually impossible to find.
Anyone who can help Weissmann find more information – feel free to do
so.</p>

<h2 id="gsoc-2024-compile-gpu-kernels-using-clangir">GSoC 2024: Compile
GPU kernels using ClangIR</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-09, from: LLVM Blog</p>
<p>
Hello everyone! I’m 7mile. My GSoC project this summer is
<a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/clangir-compile-gpu-kernels-using-clangir/76984">Compile
GPU kernels using ClangIR</a>. It’s been an exciting journey in compiler
development, and I’m thrilled to share the progress and insights gained
along the way here.
</p>
<h1 id="background">
Background
</h1>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/clangir">The ClangIR project</a> aims
to establish a new IR for Clang, built on top of MLIR. As part of the
ongoing effort to support heterogeneous programming models, this project
focuses on integrating OpenCL C language support into ClangIR. The
ultimate goal is to enable the compilation of GPU kernels written in
OpenCL C into LLVM IR targeting the SPIR-V architecture, laying the
groundwork for future enhancements in SYCL and CUDA support.
</p>
<h1 id="what-we-did">
What We Did
</h1>
<p>
Our work involved several key areas:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Address Space Support</strong>: One of the fundamental tasks was
teaching ClangIR to handle address spaces, a vital feature for languages
like OpenCL. Initially, we considered mimicking LLVM’s approach, but
this proved inadequate for ClangIR’s goals. After thorough discussion
and an
<a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-clangir-unified-address-space-design-in-clangir/79728">RFC</a>,
we implemented a unified address space design that aligns with ClangIR’s
objectives, ensuring a clean and maintainable code structure.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>OpenCL Language and SPIR-V Target Integration</strong>: We
extended ClangIR to support the OpenCL language and the SPIR-V target.
This involved enhancing the pipeline to accommodate the latest OpenCL
3.0 specification and implementing hooks for language-specific and
target-specific customizations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Vector Type Support</strong>: OpenCL vector types, a critical
feature for GPU programming, were integrated into ClangIR. We leveraged
ClangIR’s existing cir.vector type to generate the necessary code,
ensuring consistent compilation results.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Kernel and Module Metadata Emission</strong>: We added support
for emitting OpenCL kernel and module metadata in ClangIR, a necessary
step for proper integration with the SPIR-V target. This included the
creation of structured attributes to represent metadata, following
MLIR’s preferences for well-defined structures.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Global and Static Variables with Qualifiers</strong>: We
implemented support for global and static variables with qualifiers like
<code>global</code>, <code>constant</code>, and <code>local</code>,
ensuring that these constructs are correctly represented and lowered in
the ClangIR pipeline.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Calling Conventions</strong>: We adjusted the calling
conventions in ClangIR to align with SPIR-V requirements, migrating from
the default <code>cdecl</code> to SPIR-V-specific conventions like
<code>SpirKernel</code> and <code>SpirFunction</code>. This also enables
most OpenCL built-in functions like <code>barrier</code> and
<code>get_global_id</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>User Experience Enhancements</strong>: Finally, we ensured that
the end-to-end kernel compilation experience using ClangIR was smooth
and intuitive, with minimal manual intervention required.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="results">
Results
</h1>
<p>
The project successfully met its primary goals. OpenCL kernels from the
Polybench-GPU benchmark suite can now be compiled using ClangIR into
LLVM IR for SPIR-V. All patches have been merged into the main ClangIR
repository, and the project’s progress has been well-documented in the
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/clangir/issues/689">overview issue</a>.
I believe the work not only advanced OpenCL support but also laid a
solid foundation for future enhancements, such as SYCL and CUDA support
in ClangIR.
</p>
<p>
We have successfully compiled and executed all 20 OpenCL C benchmarks
from the
<a href="https://github.com/sgrauerg/polybenchGpu">polybenchGpu</a>
repository, passing the built-in result validation. Please refer to our
<a href="https://github.com/seven-mile/clangir-ocl-ae">artifact
evaluation repository</a> for detailed instructions on how to experiment
with our work.
</p>
<h1 id="future-works">
Future Works
</h1>
<p>
As we look forward, there are two key areas that require further
development:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Function Attribute Consistency</strong>: For example, the
<code>convergent</code> function attribute is crucial for preventing
misoptimizations in SIMT languages like OpenCL. ClangIR currently lacks
this attribute, which could lead to issues in parallel computing
contexts. Addressing this is a priority to ensure correct optimization
behavior.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Support for OpenCL Built-in Types</strong>: Another critical
area for future work is the support for OpenCL built-in types, such as
<code>pipe</code> and <code>image</code>. These types are essential for
handling data streams and image processing tasks in various specialized
OpenCL applications. Supporting these types will significantly enhance
ClangIR’s adherence to the OpenCL standard, broadening its applicability
and ensuring better compatibility with a wide range of OpenCL programs.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
This project would not have been possible without the guidance and
support of the LLVM community. I extend my deepest gratitude to my
mentors, Julian Oppermann, Victor Lomüller, and Bruno Cardoso Lopes,
whose expertise and encouragement were instrumental throughout this
journey. Additionally, I would like to thank Vinicius Couto Espindola
for his collaboration on ABI-related work. This experience has been
immensely rewarding, both technically and in terms of community
engagement.
