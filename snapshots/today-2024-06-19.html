<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I finished listening to the audio version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Sandel&quot;&gt;Michael Sandel&lt;/a&gt;’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.harvard.edu/sandel/publications/what-money-cant-buy-moral-limits-markets&quot;&gt;What Money Can’t Buy&lt;/a&gt;” a few days ago. Great book, I hated every second of it. The topic is very interesting but most of the concepts and examples were infuriating. The book touches on pretty much everything I hate about the current state of the world when it comes to its relationship with money and advertising. Still, was good company on a few long road trips and I love when the audiobooks are narrated by the author. Thanks for suggesting the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnjago.com&quot;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;hr&gt;

XREAL is a company that makes Augmented Reality glasses, which basically
put a floating display in front of your eyes without completely
obscuring your vision, allowing you to see virtual and real-world
objects at the same time. The latest model also support “immersion
controls” which let you block out the real world while watching videos.

debugger pads in SwiftUI and it would be fun”.

Good news, I did, it was fun, the result is awesome, and it was quick.

Bad news, the immediate consequence of this was “well there are a lot of

the earliest I can have useful TestFlight feedback.

<p>June 19th is known as Juneteenth, a U.S. holiday celebrating the end
of slavery in the former Confederate states of the American Civil War.
In observance of the day, international collaborators gathered in
California to connect history with the future using an augmented reality
app. Matt Dibble has our story from Oakland.</p>

One effort in trying to narrow the racial wealth gap is by supporting
Black-owned businesses. That effort grew in 2020 amid racial justice
protests after the murder of George Floyd, but where do things stand
now? We check in. Plus, Brooklyn’s Long Time Tattoo is a queer Asian
American Pacific Islander run tattoo collective that’s helping create an
inclusive space for clients, other tattoo artists and the wider
community.

ALPR Vulnerabilities Prove Mass Surveillance Is a Public Safety
Threat</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>

[<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/06/new-alpr-vulnerabilities-prove-mass-surveillance-public-safety-threat">Dave
Maass and Cooper Quintin at EFF</a>]
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“When law enforcement uses ALPRs to document the comings and goings of
every driver on the road, regardless of a nexus to a crime, it results
in gargantuan databases of sensitive information, and few agencies are
equipped, staffed, or trained to harden their systems against quickly
evolving cybersecurity threats.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As the EFF points out, it’s often vulnerable software - and even when
it’s not, it violates the security principle of only collecting the
information you need. Information security and data strategies are not
core law enforcement skillsets, and the software they buy is often
oversold.
</p>
<p>
As the EFF explains:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“That partially explains why, more than 125 law enforcement agencies
reported a data breach or cyberattacks between 2012 and 2020, according
to research by former EFF intern Madison Vialpando. The Motorola
Solutions article claims that ransomware attacks”targeting U.S. public
safety organizations increased by 142 percent” in 2023.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The use of these tactics seems uncontrolled - perhaps this is one area
where legislation could help.

<h2 id="us-lawmakers-meet-dalai-lama-as-china-slams-visit">US lawmakers
meet Dalai Lama as China slams visit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New Delhi — A group of U.S. lawmakers met the Dalai Lama in India’s
northern town of Dharamshala Wednesday, amid cheers from Tibetans in
exile and an angry reaction from China, which calls the Tibetan
spiritual leader a separatist and a splittist.</p>
<p>The visit follows the passage last week of a bill by the U.S.
Congress that seeks to encourage dialogue between Beijing and Tibetan
leaders in exile, who have been seeking more autonomy for Tibet. Talks
with the Dalai Lama’s representatives and China stalled in 2010.</p>
<p>“This bill is a message to the Chinese government that we have
clarity in our thinking and our understanding of this issue of the
freedom of Tibet,” Nancy Pelosi, former House Speaker, said to cheers
from hundreds of Tibetans whom the lawmakers addressed at a public
ceremony after meeting the Dalai Lama at his residence.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to soon sign the legislation
called “Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act,” also
referred to as the Resolve Tibet Act.</p>
<p>In Dharamshala, where the Tibetan government in exile is based, the
visit of the U.S. lawmakers brought hope. “It is a jubilant moment for
all Tibetans. We are all overjoyed. The visit is very significant
because it comes soon after the passage of the bill which we hope will
soon be passed into law,” Tenzin Lekshay, spokesperson for the Central
Tibetan Administration, told VOA.</p>
<p>Congressman Michael McCaul, who led the seven-member visiting
delegation, said the bill reaffirms American support for what he
referred to as the Tibetan right to self- determination. He said that
their delegation had received a letter from the Chinese Communist Party,
warning them not to visit.</p>
<p>Beijing said the U.S. should not sign into law the bill passed by
Congress. “China will take resolute measures to firmly defend its
sovereignty, security and development interests,” Chinese foreign
ministry spokesman, Lin Jian said on Tuesday, as the lawmakers arrived
in the Indian town.</p>
<p>The Chinese embassy in New Delhi reiterated Beijing’s concerns. “We
urge the U.S. side to fully recognize the anti-China separatist nature
of the Dalai group, honor the commitments the U.S. has made to China on
issues related to Xizang, stop sending the wrong signal to the world,”
it said in a statement Tuesday night. Xizang is China’s name for
Tibet.</p>
<p>In his remarks to Tibetans, McCaul said it is important that China
not influence the choice of the Dalai Lama’s successor. “Beijing has
even attempted to insert itself into choosing the successor of the Dalai
Lama,” he said. “We will not let that happen.”</p>
<p>The issue is contentious. China says it has the right to approve the
spiritual leader’s successor while according to Tibetan tradition, the
Dalai Lama is reincarnated after his death. The Dalai Lama has said his
successor is likely to be found in India but Tibetans in exile fear
China will try to designate a person to be the successor, in an effort
to bolster control over Tibet.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tibetan spokesman Lekshay said China needs to come forward
to reinstate a dialogue with exiled Tibetan leaders. “It is a time for
introspection for China to see what is going wrong, particularly with
the Tibet issue which has been a longstanding conflict. China needs to
be more positive.”</p>
<p>Beijing does not recognize the exiled administration. A formal
dialogue process between the Dalai Lama’s representatives and the
Chinese government ended in 2010 after it failed to produce a concrete
outcome.</p>
<p>Pointing out that they are asking for autonomy within China and not
independence, Lekshay said the Tibetan administration in exile did not
represent a separatist movement.</p>
<p>Tibetans in exile say they fear that their culture, language and
identity is under threat due to Chinese assimilation of the region.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959, has been instrumental in
putting the Tibetan cause in the global spotlight but in recent years
some Tibetan activists have expressed concerns that the Tibet cause is
not getting appropriate attention in Western capitals.</p>
<p>The Himalayan town of Dharamshala has been the Dalai Lama’s home
since he fled Tibet over six decades ago following a failed uprising
against Chinese rule.</p>

Part of the of the racial wealth gap is a gap in business ownership.
Today, we’re joined by Kezia Williams, CEO of the Black upStart, a
national initiative and curriculum for Black entrepreneurs, for a
conversation about some of the hurdles Black business owners face and
efforts to close the gap. Also on the program: A new study finds that
expanding early childhood education could be well worth the investment.

<p class="drop-caps" style="text-align: left;">
Maybe you’re reading this in a downpour. Perhaps you’re reading it
because you have questions about the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/noaa-hurricane-forecast-2024" target="_self">upcoming
hurricane season</a>. Or maybe you’re reading it because you’re one of
the 150 million Americans enduring
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/live-blog/heat-wave-live-updates-rcna157615" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">record-breaking
temperatures</a> in this week’s heat dome.
</p>
<p>
Whatever the reason, you have a question: <em><em> Is this climate
change</em></em>?
</p>
<p>
There’s an old maxim — that, like many things, is often dubiously
attributed to Mark Twain — that goes something like, “Climate is what
you expect and weather is what you get.” Weather refers to the event
itself, while climate refers to the trends (averaged over 30 years or
more,
<a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/weather-or-climate-whats-difference/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">usually</a>)
that might make such an event more or less likely.
</p>
<p>
Climate change is almost always an exacerbating factor in the case of
something like a heat wave or a heat dome. In other situations, the
picture is far more complicated and uncertain. It can take years to
understand if and how climate change made an extreme weather event more
likely, and while organizations like
<a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World
Weather Attribution</a> work hard to provide quick and accurate
estimations, getting the science wrong can fuel climate skepticism and
bolster deniers’ arguments. While it might be tempting to pin all
extreme weather on climate change, the truth is, not all of it is.
</p>
<p>
Still, we do know a lot about how climate change influences the weather
— and we’re always learning more. While this guide is far from the
be-all and end-all of attribution and should be referred to with
caveats, here is what we know about how climate change is shaping the
extreme weather we see today.

<h3 class="rm-anchors" id="heat">
Heat waves and heat domes
</h3>
<p>
“When you’re looking at heat extremes, there is almost always a climate
change signal,” Clair Barnes, a research associate with World Weather
Attribution, told me. “I don’t think there’s ever <em><em>not</em></em>
been a climate change signal since I’ve been doing it in the last couple
of years.”
</p>
<p>
As the planet warms, local temperatures respond everywhere. There are
not as many complicating variables in this relationship as there are
with something like <a href="#drought">drought</a>. “With heat waves,
it’s the same answer every time: It got hotter because it’s got hotter,”
Barnes said.
</p>
<p>
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2752-5295/ac6e7d" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
found</u></a> that the kind of heat waves that would have occurred once
in a decade before the Industrial Revolution now occur almost three
times more frequently and are 1.2 degrees Celsius (or 2.2 degrees
Fahrenheit) warmer. The most extreme examples — like the 2021 heat dome
over the Pacific Northwest — appear to have been possible
<em><em>only</em></em> because of warming caused by
<a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>greenhouse
gas emissions</u></a>. Additionally, about 37% of global
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/heat-wave-stroke-death-die" target="_self"><u>heat-related
deaths</u></a>, which amount to tens of thousands of deaths per year,
are attributable to climate change.
</p>
<p>
There have, of course, always been heat waves. But it is with high
confidence that scientists say
<a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/more-extremely-hot-days-2023" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>they
are hotter and last longer</u></a> now than they would otherwise because
of climate change.
</p>
<p>
<em><strong><em>Did climate change do it?</em></strong></em><em><em> It
is
“</em></em><a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-what-the-new-ipcc-report-says-about-extreme-weather-and-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>virtually
certain</em></em></u></a><em><em>” that heat waves are more frequent and
hotter than they otherwise would be because of climate change.</em></em>
</p>
<h3 class="rm-anchors" id="fire">
Wildfires
</h3>
<p>
WWA doesn’t specifically study wildfires since they aren’t technically
“weather” (though once they form,
<a href="https://www.capradio.org/articles/2022/08/05/massive-wildfires-are-creating-their-own-weather-scientists-want-to-learn-how-to-predict-it/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>they
can make their own</u></a>). Instead, the organization studies the
conditions that make a fire <em><em>more likely</em></em>. In the
American West, this deadly combo usually involves high pressure,
extremely dry air, and some wind.
</p>
<p>
Globally, burned areas decreased between 1998 and 2015, but that isn’t
because fire-weather conditions are improving — rather, regional leaders
have gotten better at things like land use and fire management. Fire
<em><em>weather</em></em>, meanwhile, is increasing and lasting longer
due to climate change. In particular, hotter temperatures — especially
<a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/warm-summer-nights-2022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hotter
overnight temperatures</u></a> — make it more difficult to combat the
fires that do ignite. (Most fires in the U.S. start due to human
<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1617394114" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>negligence</u></a>
or
<a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/research/treesearch/37036" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>arson</u></a>,
rather than by natural causes such as lightning strikes.)
</p>
<p>
This is especially the case in California, where 10 of the state’s
largest fires have occurred in the past two decades, with five in 2020
alone; a 2023 National Integrated Drought Information System-funded
study further found
<a href="https://www.drought.gov/news/study-finds-climate-change-blame-record-breaking-california-wildfires-2023-08-08" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
320% increase in burned areas</a> in the state between 1996 and 2021 due
to contributions of human-caused climate change, with that number
expected to grow in the coming decades.
</p>
<p>
On average, wildfire weather season lengthened
<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020RG000726" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>by
two weeks</u></a> around the globe from 1979 to 2019. The IPCC has
<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-11/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>medium
confidence</u></a> in the claim that fire weather has become more
probable in the U.S., Europe, Australia, and parts of Europe over the
past century, and high confidence that fire weather will increase
regionally due to global warming in the coming years.
</p>
<p>
<em><strong><em>Did climate change do it?
</em></strong></em><em><em>Climate change has almost certainly
exacerbated the heat, humidity, and drought conditions necessary for
wildfires to start. The actual ignition of the fire is frequently
human-caused, however, and complicating variables such as
</em></em><a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/grass-fires-wildfires-maui-marshall" target="_self"><em>local
vegetation</em></a><em><em>, forest management, and land use can also
muddle the picture.</em></em>
</p>
<h3 class="rm-anchors" id="hurricanes">
Hurricanes and tropical storms
</h3>
<p>
Tropical cyclones are large and complicated storm systems.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/why-is-the-atlantic-ocean-so-hot" target="_self"><u>Ocean
temperatures</u></a>, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, wind shear,
barometric pressure, atmospheric moisture,
<a href="https://mynews13.com/fl/orlando/weather/2023/09/07/bathymetry--a-lesser-known-factor-for-storm-surge" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
shape of the continental shelf</u></a>, emergency preparedness measures,
and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-season-2024" target="_self"><u>pure
luck</u></a> all affect how destructive a given storm might be — when or
if it makes landfall. Climate change can put a thumb on the scale, but
it is far from a lone actor.
</p>
<p>
Hurricanes — the strongest
<a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/cyclone.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>manifestation</u></a>
of a tropical cyclone — essentially work by transferring
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/09/climate-change-impact-hurricane-ian/671604/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>heat
from the ocean into wind energy</u></a>. Because the ocean absorbs
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/15/oceans-have-been-absorbing-the-worlds-extra-heat-but-theres-a-huge-payback" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>excess
heat from the warming atmosphere</u></a>, scientists expect to see more
“major” hurricanes of Category 3 or above in the coming years.
</p>
<p>
The storms aren’t just getting more powerful, though. Because of the
interaction between ocean heat and energy in a hurricane, the storms
also intensify more rapidly and are “more than twice as likely to
strengthen from a weak Category 1 hurricane to a major Category 3 or
stronger hurricane in a 24-hour period than they were between 1970 and
1990,” according to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/hurricanes-rapid-intensification-andra-garner" target="_self"><u>new
research published last year</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
WWA says it cannot attribute the intensification of any
<em><em>individual</em></em> storm to climate change
<a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/wp-content/uploads/ENG_WWA-Reporting-extreme-weather-and-climate-change.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>due
to relatively limited modeling</u></a> so far, so the organization
instead looks at how climate change may have amplified associated
rainfall and storm surges. <a href="#rain">Rainfall and flooding</a>
are, in fact,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/noaa-hurricane-forecast-2024" target="_self"><u>more
deadly</u></a> than high wind speeds in hurricanes, and both are
understood to be increasing because of climate change. Put simply, a
warmer atmosphere can hold more water, which means worse deluges.
Researchers linked extreme rainfall during Hurricanes Katrina, Maria,
and Irma to climate change; Hurricane Harvey, which flooded up to 50% of
the properties in Harris County, Texas, when it made landfall in 2017,
had a rainfall total 15% to 38% greater than it would have been in a
pre-industrial world,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/25/climate/hurricane-harvey-climate-change.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>researchers
found</u></a>. Additionally, rising sea levels caused by climate change
will worsen coastal flooding during such events.
</p>
<p>
However, “trends indicate no significant change in the frequency of
tropical cyclones globally,” according to the IPCC. That is, there
aren’t <em><em>more </em></em>hurricanes; the ones that form are just
more likely to become <em><em>major</em></em> hurricanes. Scientists
understand far less about what climate change means for the smaller
Category 1 or 2 storms, or if it will impact the diameter of the storms
that do form.
</p>
<p>
<em><strong><em>Did climate change do it? </em></strong></em><em><em>The
greenhouse effect is making the atmosphere warmer, and in a warmer
climate, we’d expect to see more major hurricanes of Category 3 and
above. Evidence also points to hurricanes intensifying much more rapidly
in today’s climate than in the past. Climate does not seem to play a
role in the overall number of storms, though, and other critical factors
like the path of a storm and the emergency preparedness of a given
community have a significant impact on the potential loss of life but
aren’t linked to a warmer atmosphere. Hurricanes are complicated events
and there is still much more research to be done in understanding how
exactly they’re impacted by climate change.</em></em>
</p>
<h3 class="rm-anchors" id="rain">
Extreme rain, floods, and landslides
</h3>
<p>
In the winter, your skin might feel dry, and your lips might chap; in
the summer, many parts of the country feel sticky and swampy. This is
simple, observable physics: Cold air holds less moisture, and warm air
holds more. The “Clausius-Clapeyron” relation, as it is known, tells us
that in 1 degree C warmer air, there is 7% more moisture. All that
moisture has to go somewhere, so quite literally, when it rains, it
pours. (That is, when and <em><em>where</em></em> it rains: WWA notes
that “an attribution study in northern Europe found that human influence
has so far had little effect on the atmospheric circulation that caused
a severe rainfall event.”)
</p>
<p>
Like heat, the relationship between warm air and rainfall is well
understood, which is why the IPCC is highly confident in the
attributable influence of climate change on extreme rain. While it
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change" target="_self"><u>may
seem confusing</u></a> that both droughts and intense rainfall are
symptoms of climate change, the warming atmosphere seems to
<a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/drought-and-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>increase
precipitation variability</u></a>, making events on the extreme margins
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/03/14/climate/extreme-weather-climate-change.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
likely and more frequent</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Increased precipitation can have counterintuitive results, though. Rain
occurring over fewer overall days due to bursts of extreme rainfall, for
example, can actually
<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2752-5295/ac6e7d" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>worsen
droughts</u></a>. And while it might seem like more water in the
atmosphere would mean snowier winters, that’s only true in certain
places. Because it’s <em><em>also </em></em>warmer,
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/25/weather/snowfall-temperatures-climate-change-water/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>snowfall
is declining globally</u></a> while winters are getting wetter — and as
a result,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/warm-winters-mental-health-depression" target="_self"><u>probably
more miserable</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
But what does “more rain” really mean? Rain on its own isn’t necessarily
bad, but when it
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/nyc-flooding-whirlpool-subway-sea-lions" target="_self"><u>overwhelms
urban infrastructure</u></a> or
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/flash-flood-warning-watch" target="_self"><u>threatens
roads and houses</u></a>, it can quickly become deadly. Flooding, of
course, is often the result of extreme rain, but “the signal in the
rainfall is not necessarily correlated to the magnitude of the floods
because there are other factors that turn rain into a flood,” Barnes,
the research associate with WWA, told me, citing variables such as land
use, water management, urban drainage, and other physical elements of a
landscape.
</p>
<p>
Landslides, likewise, are caused by everything from volcanic eruptions
to human construction, but rain is often a factor (climate-linked
phenomena like
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/climate/wildfire-extreme-rain-mudslides.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wildfires</a>
and
<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/chapter/chapter-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>thawing
permafrost</u></a> also contribute to landslides). The IPCC writes with
“high confidence” that landslides, along with floods and water
availability, “have the potential to lead to severe consequences for
people, infrastructure, and the economy in most mountain regions.”
</p>
<p>
<em><strong><em>Did climate change do it?
</em></strong></em><em><em>More extreme rainfall is consistent with our
understanding of climate change’s effects. Many other local, physical
factors</em></em><em><strong>
</strong></em><em><em>can</em></em><em><strong>
</strong></em><em><em>compound or mitigate disasters like floods and
mudslides, however.</em></em>
</p>
<h2>
<u><em><em></em></em>The Oddballs</u>
</h2>
<h3 class="rm-anchors" id="drought">
Drought
</h3>
<p>
When I spoke with Barnes, of WWA, she told me, “It’s really easy to
define a heat wave. You just go, ‘It was hot.’” Droughts, not so much.
For one thing, you have to define the time span you’re looking at. There
are also different kinds of drought: meteorological, when there hasn’t
been enough rain; hydrological, when rivers are low possibly because
something else is diverting water from the natural cycle; and
agricultural, when there is not enough water specifically for crops.
Like flooding, many different infrastructural and physical factors go
into exacerbating or even creating various kinds of droughts.
</p>
<p>
Drought as we mean it here, though, is a question of soil moisture,
Barnes told me. “That’s really hard to get data on,” she said, “and we
don’t necessarily understand the feedback mechanisms affecting that as
well as we understand heat waves.” As recently as 2013, the IPCC
<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-climate-change-is-already-making-droughts-worse/" target="_blank"><u>had
only low confidence</u></a> that trends in drought could be attributed
to climate change.
</p>
<p>
We have a better understanding of how drought and climate change
interact now, including how higher temperatures drive evaporation and
cut into snowpack, leading to less meltwater in rivers. The IPCC’s most
recent report concluded that “even relatively small incremental
increases in global warming (+0.5C) cause a worsening of droughts in
some regions.” The IPCC also has high confidence that “more regions are
affected by increases in agricultural and ecological droughts with
increasing global warming.”
</p>
<p>
WWA’s attribution studies have, however, found examples of droughts that
have <em><em>no</em></em> connection to climate change. The organization
flags that it has the highest confidence in the climate affecting
droughts in the Mediterranean, southern Africa, central and eastern
Asia, southern Australia, and western North America and lower confidence
in central and west Africa, western and central Europe, northeast South
America, and New Zealand.
</p>
<p>
<em><strong><em>Did climate change do it?
</em></strong></em><em><em>Maybe. Some droughts have a strong climate
signal — California’s, for example. Still, researchers remain cautious
about attribution for these complicated events due in part to their
</em></em><a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2023/05/climate-change-and-droughts-whats-the-connection/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>significant
regional variability</em></em></u></a><em><em>. </em></em>
</p>
<h3 class="rm-anchors" id="tornadoes">
Tornadoes
</h3>
<p>
Tornadoes are extremely difficult to study. Compared to droughts, which
can last years, tornadoes occupy a teeny tiny area and last for just a
blip in time. They “wouldn’t even register” on the models WWA uses for
its attribution studies, Barnes said. “It would probably look like a
slightly raised average wind speed.” The IPCC,
<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Chapter11.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>for
its part</u></a>, has only “low confidence” in a connection between
climate change and “severe convective storms” like tornadoes, in part
due to the “short length of high-quality data records.”
</p>
<p>
But we are learning more every day. This spring, researchers posited
that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/tornado-study" target="_self"><u>Tornado
Alley is moving east</u></a> and “away from the warm season, especially
the summer, and toward the cold season.” Though it’s not entirely clear
why this is happening, one theory is that it relates to how climate
change is affecting regional seasonality: winters and nights are
becoming warmer in certain areas, and thus more conducive to tornado
formation, while others are becoming
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/04/02/tornadoes-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>too
hot</u></a> for storms to form during the normal season.
</p>
<p>
<em><strong><em>Did climate change do it?
</em></strong></em><em><em>Researchers aren’t entirely sure but there
doesn’t appear to be a correlation between tornado formation and climate
change. Still, warmer temperatures potentially make certain areas more
or less prone to tornadoes than they were in the past. </em></em>
</p>
<h3 class="rm-anchors" id="thunderstorms">
Thunderstorms and hail
</h3>
<p>
We say “<em><em>it was a dark and stormy night</em></em>” because
“<em><em>it was a severe convective storm</em></em>” doesn’t have the
same ring. But an SCS — which forms when warm, moist air rises into
colder air — is
<a href="https://www.zurichna.com/knowledge/articles/2023/08/rise-in-severe-convective-storms-increases-risk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
most common and most damaging</u></a> weather phenomenon in the United
States. You probably just call it a thunderstorm.
</p>
<p>
Severe convective storms cause many localized events that we think of as
“weather,” including <a href="#rain">heavy rainfall</a>, high winds,
<a href="#tornadoes">tornadoes</a>, hail, thunder, and lightning.
Because heat and moisture are necessary ingredients for these kinds of
storms, and because the atmosphere is getting both warmer and wetter,
climate models “consistently” and confidently predict an “increase in
the frequency of severe thunderstorms,” the IPCC notes — but, “there is
low confidence<em> </em>in the details of the projected increase.”
Trends remain poorly studied and highly regionally dependent; in the
United States, for example, there is still no evidence of a “significant
increase in convective storms, and hail and severe thunderstorms.”
Still,
<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021EF002277" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>other
research</u></a> suggests that for every 1.8 degree F of warming, the
conditions favorable to severe convective storms will increase in
frequency by up to 20%.
</p>
<p>
Hail forms during severe convective storms when the hot, moist air rises
to a region of the atmosphere
<a href="https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/hail/#:~:text=Hailstones%20are%20formed%20when%20raindrops,freeze%20onto%20the%20hailstone's%20surface." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>where
it is cold enough to freeze</u></a>. Like thunderstorms more generally,
data is fairly limited on hail, making it difficult to study long-term
trends (most climate models also
<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-12/#12.3.4.5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>do
not look directly at hail</u></a>, studying convective storms more
broadly instead). However,
<a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/severe-storm-super-hazards" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>it’s
been hypothesized</u></a> that climate change could create larger and
more destructive hail in the future; if thunderstorm updrafts grow
stronger, as projected, then they could hold hail at freezing high
altitudes for longer, allowing individual hailstones to grow larger
before falling back to Earth.
<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022EF002768" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>One
study</u></a> even suggested that with continued warming, there could be
a 145% increase in “significant severe hail” measuring at least 2 inches
in diameter — that is, a little smaller than a tennis ball.
</p>
<p>
<em><em><em><strong><em>Did climate change do it?
</em></strong></em><em><em>Everything we know about thunderstorms
suggests that a warmer, wetter atmosphere will mean severe convection
storms become both more frequent and more intense. But there is still
very little available data to track the long-term trends attributing any
one storm to climate change would be nearly
impossible.</em></em><br/></em></em>

Snowstorms and extreme cold
</h3>
<p>
Just as virtually all <a href="#heat">heat waves</a> worldwide are
worsened by climate change, “nearly every instance of extreme cold
across the world has decreased in likelihood,” according to the WWA.
While the organization has run attribution studies on “a few” heavy
snowfall events, it has either found no link to climate change or has
been unable to state a conclusion confidently. On the other hand, the

</u><u><em><em>loss </em></em></u><u>of snow cover</u></a>, permafrost,
Arctic sea ice, and glaciers has a high-confidence link to human-caused
climate change in the IPCC report.
</p>
<p>
Just because climate change makes extreme cold and snowstorms less
likely does not mean they won’t happen.

suggests climate change could bring more snow to certain places, as
extremely cold parts of the world warm to
<a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/weather/2021/01/25/buffalo-blog-post" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>snow-friendly
temperatures</u></a>, and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/east-west-flood-blizzard-storm" target="_self"><u>increased
precipitation</u></a> from a warmer atmosphere results in more flurries.
Parts of Siberia and the northern Great Plains are even experiencing a
<em><em>deepening</em></em> snowpack.

<p>
<em><strong><em>Did climate change do it?
</em></strong></em><em><em>Probably not — though there are notable
exceptions.</em></em>

<h3 class="rm-anchors" id="earthquakes">
Earthquakes
</h3>
<p>
An earthquake is usually caused by the release of energy when two
tectonic plates suddenly slip past each other (though they can also be
caused
<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/02/08/west-texas-earthquakes-fracking/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>by
fossil fuel extraction</u></a>). But before you dismiss earthquakes as
having no connection to climate change, there <em><em>is </em></em>one
place where there <em><em>could</em></em> be a link: water.
</p>
<p>
As Emily Pontecorvo
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/climate-change-earthquakes" target="_self"><u>wrote
for Heatmap</u></a> this spring, “Changes in surface water, whether
because of heavy rain, snow, or drought, could either increase or
relieve stress on geologic faults, causing them to shift.” Admittedly,
even if there <em><em>is</em></em> a relationship between climate
change, water, and earthquakes, it appears to be small — so small that
humans probably can’t feel any resulting quakes.
</p>
<p>
<em><strong><em>Did climate change do it?
</em></strong></em><em><em>It’s highly unlikely.</em></em>
</p>
<h3 class="rm-anchors" id="turbulence">
Airplane turbulence
</h3>
<p>
Earlier this year,
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-21/singapore-air-flight-makes-emergency-landing-in-bangkok-1-dead" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>extreme
turbulence</u></a> on a Singapore-bound flight from London killed one
person and injured at least 20 others. While such events remain rare —
the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board
<a href="https://stevens.house.gov/media/in-the-news/singapore-airlines-flight-puts-focus-rising-turbulence-danger#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20National%20Transportation%20Safety,and%20were%20in%20stable%20condition." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recorded</u></a>
just 101 serious injuries caused by turbulence on millions of flights
between 2013 and 2022 — extreme turbulence appears to be increasing,
potentially because of climate change.
</p>
<p>
According to
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/21/what-causes-air-turbulence-and-how-worried-should-passengers-be" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one
study</u></a>, severe turbulence is up 55% between 1979 and 2020,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2019/08/07/buckle-up-climate-change-is-already-contributing-bumpier-north-atlantic-flights-study-finds/?itid=lk_inline_manual_12" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>seemingly
due to</u></a> an increase in wind shear at high altitudes caused by the
temperature contrast between the equator and the North Pole. (This
relationship is a little bit complicated, but essentially, at higher
altitudes, the temperature over the pole has been
<em><em>declining</em></em> due to rapid Arctic temperature changes even
as it’s increased at the equator; lower in the troposphere, the opposite
is happening). Other studies have similarly shown that doubling the
concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could increase
moderate-to-severe turbulence by
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-21/flight-turbulence-is-getting-worse-because-of-climate-change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>as
much as 127%</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Data, however, is limited and fairly subjective, leading to some
skepticism in the scientific community and
<a href="https://x.com/DrPaulDWilliams/status/1794332398215430377" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>inaccurate
dismissals by climate-change deniers</u></a>. As with many complex
weather phenomena, our understanding of how climate change interacts
with turbulence will likely grow in the coming years as the field of
research develops.
</p>
<p>
<em><strong><em>Did climate change do it?
</em></strong></em><em><em>Potentially in some cases, but there is still
much to learn about the connection between the two.</em></em>
</p>
<h3 class="rm-anchors" id="dust">
Dust and sand storms
</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-desertification-and-the-role-of-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Desertification</u></a>
differs from drought in that it describes a decline in soil fertility,
water, and plant life to the point of total “land degradation.” (In
contrast, land can become productive again after a drought.) Like other
compound disasters, desertification results from natural processes,
climatic conditions, and land management practices such as grazing and
deforestation.
</p>
<p>
According to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, land degradation is “almost always”
the result of these “multiple interacting causes,” and the warming
climate certainly isn’t helping. Heat stress can kill off vegetation,
making landscapes more prone to desertification, as well as drive
aridification.
</p>
<p>
In the resulting drylands — which comprise about 46% of global land area
— you can expect dust storms (also known as
<a href="https://ein.az.gov/hazards/dust-storms#:~:text=Thunderstorms%20frequently%20produce%20strong%20winds,desert%20landscape%20at%20any%20time." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>haboobs</u></a>),
and sand storms resulting from the wind kicking up loose soils. While
there have always been sand storms, one
<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014JD022062" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a>
suggests that climate change is one of the critical drivers of global
annual dust emissions increasing by 25% between the late 19th century
and today.
</p>
<p>
However, “climate change impacts on dust and sand storm activity remain
a critical gap,”
<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/4/2022/11/SRCCL_Chapter_3.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>writes
the IPCC</u></a>, and more research is desperately needed to address
this. By the UN’s estimate, dust storms were
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8249988/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>associated</u></a>
with the deaths of 402,000 people in 2005. As many as 951 million
people, mainly in South Asia, Central Asia, West Africa, and East Asia,
could be vulnerable to the impacts of desertification if climate change
continues.
</p>
<p>
<em><strong><em>Did climate change do it? </em></strong></em><em><em>It
was potentially a factor, but we have lots more to learn.</em></em>
</p>
<h3 class="rm-anchors" id="locust">
Locust swarms
</h3>
<p>
Are locust swarms technically “weather”? Not really. But so long as
we’re on the topic of weather events of Biblical proportions, locust
swarms might as well be addressed, too.
</p>
<p>
And the answer may surprise you: Climate appears to be a driver of
locust swarms, which threaten food security and exacerbate famines
throughout Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. Locusts prefer “arid
areas punched by <a href="#rain">extreme rainfall</a>,” according to
<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adj1164" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one
study</u></a> that looked at the connection between swarms and climate
change, and while much of that pattern is fixed in the natural El
Niño–Southern Oscillation cycle, a warming climate will also “lead to
widespread increases in locust outbreaks with emerging hotspots in west
central Asia.” In particular, the research found that in a low-emissions
scenario, locust habitat could increase by 5%, while in a high-emissions
scenario, it could increase by 13% to 25% between 2065 and 2100.
</p>
<p>
<em><strong><em>Did climate change do it?
</em></strong></em><em><em>It’d likely be tricky to attribute any one
locust swarm to climate change, but as with many other natural
phenomena, climate likely plays a compounding factor.</em></em>

temps and rain could help corral blazes that forced thousands to flee
New Mexico village</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ROSWELL, N.M. — Cooler weather — and the chance of rain — could bring
some relief this week to firefighters battling blazes in southern New
Mexico that killed one person, damaged hundreds of structures and forced
thousands to evacuate.</p>
<p>Strong wind pushed the larger of two wildfires into the mountain
village of Ruidoso, forcing residents to flee immediately with little
notice. Weather patterns are expected to shift by Wednesday morning with
moisture from a tropical wave in the Gulf of Mexico, said Joshua
Schroeder of the National Weather Service in Albuquerque.</p>
<p>“Today was really our last dry day,” he said late Tuesday. “Rains
will then peak into Thursday and diminish by the weekend.”</p>
<p>On the downside, he said, some shifts in wind were possible later
Wednesday, and rain could lead to flash flooding in newly burned
areas. </p>
<p>Ruidoso and much of the Southwest has been exceedingly dry and hot
this spring. Those conditions, along with strong wind, whipped flames
out of control Monday and Tuesday, rapidly advancing the South Fork Fire
into the village. Along with homes and businesses, a regional medical
center and the Ruidoso Downs horse track were evacuated.</p>
<p>Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office confirmed one fatality as a
result of the fire but said it had no further details.</p>
<p>More than 500 structures have been destroyed or damaged, but it’s
unclear how many were homes. A flyover to provide more accurate mapping
and a better assessment of damage was planned overnight Tuesday, Lujan
Grisham said.</p>
<p>Ardis Holder left Ruidoso with her two young daughters, her gas tank
nearly on empty and praying that they’d make it out safe. She was sure
the house she rented in the village she grew up in is gone, based on the
maps she’s seen so far.</p>
<p>“We were already seeing where all the fire hit, it’s everywhere,” she
said late Tuesday from a shelter in nearby Roswell. “If there’s
something standing, that’s awesome. But, if not, we were prepared for
the worst.”</p>
<p>Lujan Grisham declared a county-wide state of emergency that extended
to the neighboring Mescalero Apache Reservation where both fires started
and deployed National Guard troops. The declaration unlocks additional
funding and resources to manage the crisis.</p>
<p>Nationwide, wildfires have scorched more than 3,280 square miles
(8,495 square kilometers) this year — a figure higher than the 10-year
averages, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. About 20
wildfires currently burning are considered large and uncontained,
including blazes in California and Washington state.</p>
<p>Lujan Grisham said the two southern New Mexico wildfires together
have consumed more than 31 square miles (80 square kilometers). The
exact causes of the blazes hasn’t been determined, but the Southwest
Coordination Center listed them as human-caused.</p>
<p>“We are deploying every available resource to control these fires.”
she said.</p>
<p>While many older residents call Ruidoso home year-round, the
population of around 7,000 people expands to about 25,000 during the
warmer months, when New Mexicans and Texans from hotter climates seek
the cool of the leafy aspen trees, hiking trails and a chance to go
fishing. </p>
<p>Nestled within the Lincoln National Forest, Ruidoso boasts nearby
amenities including a casino, golf course and ski resort operated by the
Mescalero Apache Tribe. Horse races at the Ruidoso Downs also draw
crowds as home to one of the sport’s richest quarter-horse
competitions.</p>
<p>Ruidoso residents fled Monday through traffic-clogged downtown
streets some described as apocalyptic, with smoke darkening the evening
sky, embers raining down and 100-foot (30-meter) flames in the distance
climbing over a ridgeline.</p>
<p>The evacuation order came so quickly that she Christy Hood and her
husband Richard only had time to grab their two children and two dogs.
Heavy traffic on the way out turned what should have been a 15-minute
drive into a harrowing two-hour ordeal.</p>
<p>“As we were leaving, there were flames in front of me and to the side
of me,” said Hood, a real estate agent in Ruidoso. “And all the animals
were just running — charging — trying to get out.”</p>
<p>On social media posts, Ruidoso officials didn’t mince words: “GO NOW:
Do not attempt to gather belongings or protect your home. Evacuate
immediately.”</p>
<p>As Jacquie and Ernie Escajeda left church Monday in Ruidoso, they saw
smoke rise above a mountain behind their house.</p>
<p>They kept a close eye on their cellphones and turned on the radio for
updates. There was no “get ready,” nor “get set” — it was just “go,”
Ernie Escajeda said. They grabbed legal documents and other belongings
and left.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the couple got a call from friends who are on vacation in
Utah but have a home in Ruidoso that they’ve been told was destroyed,
Jacquie Escajeda said.</p>
<p>“They lost their home,” she said. “There’s only one home standing in
their whole little division that they live in, so there are a lot of
structures lost. We have no idea if we’re going to have a home to go
to.”</p>
<p>Public Service Company of New Mexico shut off power to part of the
village due to the fire.</p>
<p>Lujan Grisham said cellphone service had been affected in some
communities near the fire, and mobile cell towers were being set up to
restore communications.</p>
<p>Amid highway closures, many evacuees had little choice but to flee
eastward and to the city of Roswell, 75 miles (121 kilometers) away,
where hotels and shelters quickly filled. A rural gas station along the
evacuation route was overrun with people and cars.</p>

China’s electric vehicle industry has driven itself to the center of the
global conversation. Its automakers produce dozens of affordable,
technologically advanced electric vehicles that rival — and often beat —
anything coming out of Europe or North America. The United States and
the European Union have each levied tariffs on its car exports in the
past few months, hoping to avoid a “China shock” to their domestic car
industries.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>I want to ask you a question that I’ve
actually gotten from a couple of friends and colleagues — you know,
normies, folks that don’t think about energy all the time. This is a
question they’ve asked me over the last couple of weeks: Do we actually
need 100% tariffs to compete? Is that where we’re at now?<br/> <br/> So
I’m curious, I mean, is this just politics? Is this just the Biden
administration kind of responding to Trump’s chest-beating and
anti-China rhetoric as we run up to the election here? Or is it, are we
really at the point where we dug ourselves such a hole that we need not
just a 25% tariff, which was the level before this — already quite
substantial — but a 100% tariff in order to compete? Or to protect the
opportunity for the U.S. automakers to get to those economies of scale
and have time to grow?<br/> <br/> <strong>Ilaria Mazzocco: </strong>I
think that’s a good question because — look, I testified in front of the
<a href="https://www.uscc.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>USCC</u></a>
last year. And you know, I brought the data, and I was like, look,
theoretically, these companies have a cost advantage. They could come to
the U.S. You know, a 25% tariff isn’t going to stop them.<br/> <br/> And
I made that argument, but — first of all, I didn’t think that was going
to be something that was going to be a problem in nine months, but you
know, that’s a different issue. But the argument, though, that was just
a cost thing, right? Then there’s a whole argument of, like, what does
the American consumer want? What does the Chinese producer want to do,
right? What is their strategy? American consumers are very different
from Chinese consumers, right? Chinese consumers are much more similar
to European consumers in terms of commuting time, preference for smaller
vehicles, right? Americans like pickup trucks, which — you know, I just
went to China in May. I saw a lot of EVs of all kinds. I did not see any
pickup trucks, right? That’s like a pretty American kind of thing. It’s
not clear that Chinese automakers would be able to compete on that,
right?<br/> <br/> So I think it’s quite possible that there would be a
very interested part of the American market in these Chinese EVs,
especially maybe the lower cost ones — maybe urban households that want
a cheaper second vehicle, or something of the sort.But is that going to
take over a huge portion of the American market? Is that really going to
be competition for GM, or for the F-150? Like, I don’t know, actually. I
think there’s an open question there, but clearly the Biden
administration didn’t want to take any chances on that.<br/> <br/> So I
think there’s also this element where we also have preconceptions of
what the American consumer wants, and clearly we’re not going to put
that to the test, right? We’re not going to have these lower cost EVs
come into the market and maybe reshape how people approach this. And as
I said before, I just don’t think it’s realistic. A world in which an
American government allows, the Detroit Three to fail is just not
particularly realistic. But I do worry — and I mean, I’ve said this
before, that it is a game, right? It is a balance that you need to get
when you’re playing with tariffs. Because when you protect an industry,
you give them time, but you also need to give them incentives. And the
IRA does that. But you need to give them some pressure, right?<br/>
<br/> And so I think, where’s the pressure going to come from? Is it
going to come from emissions standards? Or is it going to come from
competition? Clearly it’s not going to come from competition from China.
Is it going to come from competition with Korean automakers or Japanese
automakers? Question mark, right? We don’t know.

<h2
id="us-acknowledges-northwest-dams-have-devastated-the-regions-native-tribes">US
acknowledges Northwest dams have devastated the region’s Native
tribes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SEATTLE — The U.S. government on Tuesday acknowledged, for the first
time, the harmful role it has played over the past century in building
and operating dams in the Pacific Northwest — dams that devastated
Native American tribes by inundating their villages and decimating
salmon runs while bringing electricity, irrigation and jobs to nearby
communities.</p>
<p>In a new report, the Biden administration said those cultural,
spiritual and economic detriments continue to pain the tribes, which
consider salmon part of their cultural and spiritual identity, as well
as a crucial food source.</p>
<p>The government downplayed or accepted the well-known risk to the fish
in its drive for industrial development, converting the wealth of the
tribes into the wealth of non-Native people, according to the
report.</p>
<p>“The government afforded little, if any, consideration to the
devastation the dams would bring to Tribal communities, including to
their cultures, sacred sites, economies, and homes,” the report
said.</p>
<p>It added: “Despite decades of efforts and an enormous amount of
funding attempting to mitigate these impacts, salmon stocks remain
threatened or endangered and continued operation of the dams perpetuates
the myriad adverse effects.”</p>
<p>The Interior Department’s report comes amid a $1 billion effort
announced earlier this year to restore the region’s salmon runs before
more become extinct — and to better partner with the tribes on the
actions necessary to make that happen.</p>
<p>That includes increasing the production and storage of renewable
energy to replace hydropower generation that would be lost if four dams
on the lower Snake River are ever breached. Tribes, conservationists and
even federal scientists say that would be the best hope for recovering
the salmon, providing the fish with access to hundreds of miles of
pristine habitat and spawning grounds in Idaho.</p>
<p>“President Biden recognizes that to confront injustice, we must be
honest about history – even when doing so is difficult,” said a
statement from White House Council on Environmental Quality Chair Brenda
Mallory and Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American
cabinet secretary. “In the Pacific Northwest, an open and candid
conversation about the history and legacy of the federal government’s
management of the Columbia River is long overdue.”</p>
<p>Northwest Republicans in Congress and some business and utility
groups oppose breaching the dams, saying it would jeopardize an
important shipping route for farmers and throw off clean-energy goals.
GOP Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who represents eastern Washington,
called Tuesday’s report a “sham.”</p>
<p>“This bad faith report is just the latest in a long list of examples
that prove the Biden administration’s goal has always been dam
breaching,” she said in a written statement.</p>
<p>The document was a requirement of an agreement last year to halt
decades of legal fights over the operation of the dams. It lays out how
government and private interests in the early 20th century began walling
off the tributaries of the Columbia River, the largest in the Northwest,
to provide water for irrigation or flood control, compounding the damage
that was already being caused to water quality and salmon runs by
mining, logging and rapacious non-tribal salmon cannery operations.</p>
<p>The report was accompanied by the announcement of a new task force to
coordinate salmon recovery efforts across federal agencies.</p>
<p>Tribal representatives said they were gratified with the
administration’s formal, if long-belated, acknowledgment of how the U.S.
government ignored their treaty-based fishing rights and their concerns
about how the dams would affect their people.</p>
<p>“The salmon themselves have been suffering the consequences since the
dams first were put in,” said Shannon Wheeler, chairman of the Nez Perce
Tribe. “The lack of salmon eventually starts affecting us, but they’re
the ones who have been suffering the longest. … It feels like there’s an
opportunity to end the suffering.”</p>
<p>Salmon are born in rivers and migrate far downstream to the ocean,
where they spend their adult lives before returning to their natal
rivers to spawn and die. Dams can disrupt that by cutting off access to
upstream habitat and by slowing and warming water to the point that fish
die.</p>
<p>The Columbia River Basin, an area roughly the size of Texas, was once
the world’s greatest salmon-producing river system, with as many as 16
million salmon and steelhead returning every year to spawn.</p>
<p>Now, scientists say, about 2 million salmon and steelhead return to
the Columbia and its tributaries each year, about two-thirds of them
hatchery raised. The Shoshone-Bannock Tribe in southeastern Idaho said
it once harvested enough salmon for each tribal member to have 700
pounds of fish in a year. Today, the average harvest yields barely 1
pound per tribal member.</p>
<p>Of the 16 stocks of salmon and steelhead that once populated the
river system, four are extinct and seven are listed under the Endangered
Species Act.</p>
<p>Another iconic but endangered Northwest species, a population of
killer whales, also depend on the salmon.</p>
<p>There has been growing recognition across the U.S. that the harms
some dams cause to fish outweigh their usefulness. Dams on the Elwha
River in Washington state and the Klamath River along the
Oregon-California border have been or are being removed.</p>
<p>The construction of the first dams on the main Columbia River,
including the Grand Coulee and Bonneville dams in the 1930s, provided
jobs to a country grappling with the Great Depression, as well as
hydropower and navigation.</p>
<p>As early as the late 1930s, tribes were warning that the salmon runs
could disappear, with the fish no longer able to access spawning grounds
upstream. The tribes — the Yakama Nation, Spokane Tribe, confederated
tribes of the Colville and Umatilla reservations, Nez Perce, and others
— continued to fight the construction and operation of the dams for
generations.</p>
<p>Tom Iverson, regional coordinator for Yakama Nation Fisheries, said
that while the report was gratifying, it remains “hopes and promises”
until funding for salmon restoration and renewable power projects comes
through Congress.</p>
<p>“With these agreements, there is hope,” Iverson said. “We feel like
this is a moment in time. If it doesn’t happen now, it will be too
late.”</p>

approves $360 million arms sale to Taiwan for missiles, drones</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TAIPEI, Taiwan — The U.S. State Department has approved the possible
sale to Taiwan of drones and missiles for an estimated $360 million, the
Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency said.</p>
<p>The United States is bound by law to provide Chinese-claimed Taiwan
with the means to defend itself despite the lack of formal diplomatic
ties, to the constant anger of Beijing.</p>
<p>China has been stepping up military pressure against Taiwan,
including staging war games around the island last month after the
inauguration of Lai Ching-te as president.</p>
<p>The sale “will help improve the security of the recipient and assist
in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic
progress in the region,” the Pentagon agency said in separate statements
on Tuesday in the U.S.</p>
<p>The sale includes Switchblade 300 anti-personnel and anti-armor
loitering munitions and related equipment for an estimated cost of $60.2
million, and ALTIUS 600M-V drones and related equipment for an estimated
cost of $300 million, the agency added. Loitering munitions are small
guided missiles that can fly around a target area until they are
directed to attack.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s defense ministry expressed its thanks, especially for U.S.
efforts to increase arms sales to the island. Taiwan has repeatedly
complained of delayed deliveries.</p>
<p>“In the face of the Chinese communists’ frequent military operations
around Taiwan, these US-agreed-to arms sales items will have the ability
to detect and strike in real time, and can respond quickly to enemy
threats,” it said in a statement.</p>
<p>Peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait require goodwill from China,
the ministry added.</p>
<p>“It is hoped that the People’s Liberation Army will stop its
oppressive military operations around Taiwan and jointly contribute to
regional stability.”</p>

id="biden-extends-protections-to-undocumented-spouses-of-citizens">Biden
extends protections to undocumented spouses of citizens</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The White House — For Javier Quiroz Castro, entering America’s most
famous home was an impossible dream – his parents brought him to the
U.S. from Mexico at age 3, without legal immigration status. </p>
<p>But on Tuesday, in a blue suit with an American flag pinned to his
lapel, Quiroz Castro – now a registered nurse – spoke these words at the
White House. </p>
<p>“Growing up undocumented, it was not easy,” said the Houston
resident, who used the 12-year-old Deferred Action for Childhood
Arrivals program to change his status. “Like thousands of other
immigrants, my parents endured hard labor in order to provide for the
family. They are a symbol of the American dream.”</p>
<p>Beside him stood President Joe Biden, who used the 12-year
anniversary of that landmark immigration policy to announce a move to
offer protections to undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens. The new move
could affect approximately half a million spouses of U.S. citizens, plus
50,000 noncitizen children who have a parent married to a U.S.
citizen. </p>
<p>“These couples have been raising families, sending their kids to
church and school, paying taxes, contributing to our country for 10
years or more,” Biden said. “And as a matter of a fact, the average time
they’ve spent here is 23 years, the people that are affected today.
They’ve been living in the United States all this time, in fear and
uncertainty. We can fix that. And that’s what I’m going to do
today.”</p>
<p>But, as the White House laid out in its fact sheet on the
announcement, it is a bit more complicated. </p>
<p>To be eligible, a person must have lived in the U.S. for 10-plus
years and be legally married to a citizen. It is retroactive – only
those married before June 17, 2024, qualify. </p>
<p>Those who meet those two criteria – and whose application is approved
by the Department of Homeland Security – then have three years to apply
for permanent residency. They will be allowed to remain in the U.S.,
with their families, and be eligible for work authorization during this
time.</p>
<p>Also included in Tuesday’s announcement is a plan to accelerate the
process of obtaining work visas for certain DACA recipients who have a
U.S. degree and an employment offer relating to their field. </p>
<p>Both Biden and his main challenger have repeatedly brought up
immigration on the stump, and Biden has made several recent moves on
immigration, including a recent executive order that will temporarily
restrict asylum eligibility at the U.S.-Mexico border whenever the
number of migrants crossing unlawfully or without authorization reaches
a daily average of 2,500. Those who cross the border illegally won’t be
eligible for asylum unless there are extraordinary reasons why they
should be allowed to stay.</p>
<p>For many American voters in a tight election year, immigration is a
more cleanly divisive topic that falls neatly along party lines. The
divide was reflected in the wildly divergent reactions from two
representatives from the border state of Texas. </p>
<p>“I applaud the Biden-Harris administration for heeding the call of so
many of us to use its executive authority to keep American families
together, support our Dreamers in the workforce, and boost our economy,”
Democratic congresswoman Sylvia Garcia said in a statement. </p>
<p>Whereas Ted Cruz, the Canada-born junior Republican senator from
Texas, said: “While our border is being overrun by ISIS terrorists and
cartel criminals, Joe Biden’s top priority is to give amnesty to illegal
aliens. He has utterly abandoned the American people. This amnesty
program allows illegal aliens to get citizenship and vote in future
elections. Make no mistake: Joe Biden views every illegal alien as a
future Democrat voter.” </p>
<p>And Republican candidate Donald Trump has gone further. He blames
both Biden’s policies and immigrants in general – often without clear
evidence, and sometimes in the face of facts – for a number of ills,
including crime, inflation, and even disease and terrorism. </p>
<p>“This is a Biden migrant invasion,” Trump said at a recent campaign
event. “An estimated 50% of inflation has been caused by the soaring
cost of housing which is skyrocketing due to Joe Biden’s tidal wave of
illegal immigration and high interest rates.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt accused Biden
of using this sensitive issue to gain votes.</p>
<p>“Biden only cares about one thing — power — and that’s why he is
giving mass amnesty and citizenship to hundreds of thousands of illegals
who he knows will ultimately vote for him and the Open Border Democrat
Party,” she said, echoing some of Trump’s concerns about the economy.
“Biden has created another invitation for illegal immigration through
his mass amnesty order.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Immigration advocates disagree, saying research shows that those who
benefit from this policy contribute about $13 billion in spending power
to the U.S. economy each year. </p>
<p>“We estimate that if they were to be U.S. citizens years down the
line, they could actually increase that amount by about $5 billion each
year,” Phillip Connor, a senior demographer at bipartisan
immigration-advocacy group FWD.us, told VOA. </p>
<p>“These individuals are already working in industries that already
have labor shortages with some kind of legal status that will be
permitted through this policy that will allow them to go into careers
that are barred from them right now, and to be more productive into our
economy, which will be beneficial for their families, but also
beneficial for our society as a whole,” Connor said.</p>
<p>And families affected by these policies say they can’t put a price on
it. </p>
<p>Rebecca Shi’s mother was undocumented for nearly two decades –
gaining legal status changed her life. </p>
<p>“She was a doctor in China, but for 19 years, undocumented here, so
she worked in Chinese restaurants, she worked in nursing homes, caring
for the elderly and emptying bedpans and wasn’t able to practice her
profession,” Shi, who is executive director of the American Business
Immigration Coalition, told VOA. </p>
<p>“And so when she was able to get parole in place and get her Green
Card, she went back to the medical field and it’s been thrilling and
deeply humanizing for her and just showing that when you legalize people
who are here for decades already contributing, you unleash their
economic potential, and that’s good for every American,” Shi said.</p>
<p>Quiroz Castro echoed that thought, telling the friendly crowd of
congressional Democrats, immigration advocates and immigrants how he
worked to return the warm embrace he got from the country he calls
home.</p>
<p>“Being a nurse has allowed me to give back to my community while
supporting my family especially during the pandemic, I helped take care
of patients in our COVID-19 critical care unit,” he said. “Saving
American lives was only possible because of DACA. It allowed me to live
and work and build a family in the only country I have ever known and
loved.”</p>

<h2 id="nuclear-energy-is-the-one-thing-congress-can-agree-on">Nuclear
Energy Is the One Thing Congress Can Agree On</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjQ2ODgyNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0ODc2MzA3M30.nDXFGPoqSAcfRZIDKqiOge41WJImRtZVQ8AleQ9s2KE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
While climate change policy is typically heavily polarized along party
lines, nuclear energy policy is not. The ADVANCE Act, which would reform
the nuclear regulatory policy to encourage the development of advanced
nuclear reactors,
<a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/energy-policy/2024/06/18/senate-passes-advance-act" target="_blank">passed
the Senate today</a>, by a vote of 88-2, preparing it for an almost
certain presidential signature.
</p>
<p>
The bill has been floating around Congress for about a year and is the
product of bipartisanship within the relevant committees, a notable
departure from increasingly top-down legislating in Washington. The
House of Representatives has its own nuclear regulatory bill, the Atomic
Energy Advancement Act, which the House overwhelmingly voted for in
February.
</p>
<p>
The resulting bill — a.k.a. the one that just passed — is a compromise
between the House bill and the ADVANCE Act originally introduced in
2023, has been stapled to the “Fire Grants and Safety Act,” a bipartisan
bill that reauthorizes a gaggle of federal firefighting programs that
has already passed the House.
</p>
<p>
The nuclear piece of it is designed to align the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission around so-called “advanced” nuclear reactors, a catch-all
term that covers a number of designs and concepts that are typically
smaller than the existing light water reactor fleet and would, ideally,
be largely factory-built to reduce costs. So far, the NRC has only
approved one advanced reactor design, put forward by the nuclear startup
NuScale, but plans to actually build it
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/nuscale-small-modular-reactor-nuclear-costs-inflation" target="_self">fell
through</a> due to escalating costs. Another advanced nuclear project,
<a href="https://www.terrapower.com/downloads/grounbreaking-press-release.pdf" target="_blank">Bill-Gates-backed
TerraPower</a>, has started construction ahead of receiving approval
from the NRC.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.engage.hoganlovells.com/knowledgeservices/news/advance-acts-comprehensive-nuclear-legislation-shows-progress-on-the-hill" target="_blank">The
ADVANCE Act would</a> eliminate some fees for applicants going through
the NRC approval process; instruct the NRC to develop specific rules for
“microreactors,” which might only have 20 or so megawatts of capacity
and
<a href="https://inl.gov/trending-topics/microreactors" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">could
be used for</a> single sites or rural areas; establish prizes for
advanced reactors; and “streamline” the NRC process for advanced nuclear
reactors. That last bit would involve beefing up the Commission with
additional staffing, change its mission statement to be more supportive
of nuclear energy’s benefits <strong>(</strong>as opposed to merely its
risks<strong>)</strong>, and come up with a way to make it easier to
develop nuclear reactors on brownfield sites such as decommissioned coal
plants.
</p>
<p>
The Nuclear Energy Institute said in a statement in April that the bill
would “improve our ability to get more nuclear reactors approved and on
the grid more quickly.” That is exactly what some environmental groups
are unhappy about, however. “Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s
apparent embrace of new nuclear energy development represents a stark
betrayal of the clean, safe renewable energy options like wind and solar
that he claims to champion,” Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food
&amp; Water Watch,
<a href="https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/2024/06/14/schumers-embrace-of-new-nuclear-power-is-a-dangerous-betrayal-of-clean-safe-renewable-energy/" target="_blank">said
in a statement last week</a>.
</p>
<p>
The ADVANCE Act is just one of a flurry of legislative and executive
actions to support the nuclear energy industry. Nuclear power
<a href="https://www.bclplaw.com/en-US/events-insights-news/inflation-reduction-act-expands-support-for-nuclear-power-plants.html" target="_blank">qualifies
for a number</a> of Inflation Reduction Act tax credits and the beefed
up Loan Programs Office has committed
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-announces-conditional-commitment-holtec-palisades-finance-restoration-and" target="_blank">up
to $1.5 billion</a> for the re-opening of the Palisades Nuclear Plant in
Michigan.

announces third-party RISC-V mainboard for the Framework 13 laptop</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>Framework, the company making modular, upgradeable, and repairable
laptops, and DeepComputing, the same company that’s making the DC ROMA
II RISC-V laptop we talked about last week, have announced something
incredibly cool: a brand new RISC-V mainboard that fits right into
existing Framework 13 laptops. Sporting a RISC-V StarFive JH7110 SoC,
this groundbreaking Mainboard was independently designed and developed
by DeepComputing. It’s the main component of the very first RISC-V
laptop to run Canonical’s Ubuntu Desktop and Server, and the Fedora
Desktop OS and represents the first independently developed Mainboard
for a Framework Laptop. ↫ The DeepComputing website For a company that
was predicted to fail by a popular Apple spokesperson, it seems
Framework is doing remarkably well. This new mainboard is the first one
not made by Framework itself, and is the clearest validation yet of the
concept put into the market by the Framework team. I can’t recall the
last time you could buy a laptop powered by one architecture, and then
upgrade to an entirely different architecture down the line, just by
replacing the mainboard. The news of this RISC-V mainboard has made me
dream of other possibilities – like someone crazy enough to design, I
don’t know, a POWER10 or POWER11 mainboard? Entirely impossible and
unlikely due to heat constraints, but one may dream, right?</p>

id="update-on-newton-the-wayland-native-accessibility-project">Update on
Newton, the Wayland-native accessibility project</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>There’s incredibly good news for people who use accessibility tools
on Linux, but who were facing serious, gamebreaking problems when trying
to use Wayland. Matt Campbell, of the GNOME accessibility team, has been
hard at work on an entirely new accessibility architecture for modern
free desktops, and he’s got some impressive results to show for it
already. I’ve now implemented enough of the new architecture that Orca
is basically usable on Wayland with some real GTK 4 apps, including
Nautilus, Text Editor, Podcasts, and the Fractal client for Matrix. Orca
keyboard commands and keyboard learn mode work, with either Caps Lock or
Insert as the Orca modifier. Mouse review also works more or less. Flat
review is also working. The Orca command to left-click the current flat
review item works for standard GTK 4 widgets. ↫ Matt Campbell One of the
major goals of the project was to enable such accessibility support for
Flatpak applications without having to pass an exception for the AT-SPI
bus. what this means is that the new accessibility architecture can run
as part of a Flatpak application without having to break out of their
sandbox, which is obviously a hugely important feature to implement.
There’s still a lot of work to be done, though. Something like the GNOME
shell doesn’t yet support Newton, of course, so that’s still using the
older, much slower AT-SPI bus. Wayland also doesn’t support mouse
synthesizing yet, things like font, size, style, and colour aren’t
exposed yet, and there’s a many more limitations due to this being such
a new project. The project also isn’t trying to be GNOME-specific;
Campbell wants to work with the other desktops to eventually end up with
an accessibility architecture that is truly cross-desktop. The blog post
further goes into great detail about implementation details, current and
possible future shortcomings, and a lot more.</p>

id="us-gaza-cease-fire-can-bring-israel-hezbollah-conflicts-to-an-end">US:
Gaza cease-fire can bring Israel-Hezbollah conflicts to an end</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A cease-fire in Gaza can bring the conflicts along the
Israel-Lebanon border to an end, senior U.S. officials said amid worries
of an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah fighters based in
southern Lebanon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the United States is continuing to review one shipment of
bombs for Israel over concerns about their use in the densely populated
area of Rafah.</p>
<p>Diplomatic solution</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that officials
are seeking a diplomatic way to end the battles along Israel’s northern
border with Lebanon so civilians can safely return to their homes.</p>
<p>“Hezbollah has tied the actions that it’s committing against Israel
to Gaza,” Blinken told reporters during a press conference with NATO
Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. “If we get that cease-fire [in
Gaza], I think that will make it more likely that we can find a
diplomatic resolution to the crisis in the north.”</p>
<p>In Beirut, U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein urged a de-escalation
between Israel and Hezbollah.</p>
<p>Hochstein said earlier on Tuesday that a cease-fire in Gaza “could
also bring the conflict across the Blue Line to an end.” He was
referring to the demarcation line dividing Lebanon from Israel.</p>
<p>Last week, Iran-backed Hezbollah escalated hostilities on Lebanon’s
southern border by launching rockets and weaponized drones at nine
Israeli military sites. This was the largest attack by Hezbollah since
October, when the group began exchanging fire with Israel in parallel
with the Gaza war.</p>
<p>U.S. weapons shipments to Israel</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Blinken
has “assured” him that the Biden administration is “working day and
night to remove these bottlenecks” on U.S. supplies of weapons and
ammunition to Israel.</p>
<p>The U.S. paused military shipments to Israel in May, including 1,800
907-kilogram (2,000-pound) bombs and 1,700 226-kilogram (500-pound)
bombs, because of concerns over Israel’s plan to expand a military
operation in Rafah, a densely populated city in southern Gaza, which the
United States does not support.</p>
<p>Blinken told reporters the U.S. is still pausing a shipment of heavy
bombs to Israel.</p>
<p>At the State Department, Blinken said the U.S. continues to “review
one shipment that President Biden has talked about with regard to
2,000-pound bombs” due to concerns about their use in Rafah.</p>
<p>“But everything else is moving as it normally would move” to make
sure Israel “has what it needs to defend itself against this
multiplicity of challenges,” noted Blinken.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Israeli national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi and
strategic affairs minister Ron Dermer are in Washington this week for
discussions following the visit of U.S. special envoy Hochstein to
Israel and Beirut.</p>
<p>Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder told reporters on
Tuesday that a temporary pier built to deliver aid into the Gaza Strip
is expected to be operational again this week. The U.S. military had
disconnected the floating pier last week and moved it to the port of
Ashdod in Israel because of bad weather.</p>

id="report-raises-2024-federal-budget-deficit-projection-by-400-billion">Report
raises 2024 federal budget deficit projection by $400 billion</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday that it
projects this year’s federal budget deficit to be $400 billion higher, a
27% increase compared with its original estimate released in
February. </p>
<p>The major drivers of the change are higher costs from the
supplemental spending package signed in April that provides military aid
to Ukraine and Israel; higher than estimated costs of reducing student
loan borrower balances; increased Medicaid spending; and higher spending
on FDIC insurance because the agency has not yet recovered payments it
made after the banking crises of 2023 and 2024. </p>
<p>The report also projects that the nation’s publicly held debt is set
to increase from 99% of gross domestic product at the end of 2024 to
122% of GDP — the highest level ever recorded — by the end of 2034.
“Then it continues to rise,” the report states. </p>
<p>Social security costs growing</p>
<p>Deficits are a problem for lawmakers in the years to come because of
the burden of servicing the total debt load, an aging population that
pushes up the total cost of Social Security and Medicare, and rising
health care expenses. </p>
<p>The report cuts into President Joe Biden’s claim that he has lowered
deficits, as borrowing increased in 2023 and is slated to climb again
this year. </p>
<p>The White House budget proposal released in March claims to reduce
the deficit by roughly $3 trillion over the next 10 years and would
raise tax revenues by a total of $4.9 trillion in the same period. </p>
<p>White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said after the report’s
release that “the president is going to work to do everything he can
when it comes to lowering the deficit,” adding that former president
Trump “didn’t sign a single law to reduce the deficit.” </p>
<p>White House Senior Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates blamed tax
cuts passed into law during the Trump administration for the deficit,
which he says “continue to come at the expense of the American people by
driving up deficits.” </p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump, as a candidate for president in 2024,
recently told a group of CEOs that he would further cut the corporate
tax rate he lowered while in office, among other things. The Committee
for a Responsible Federal budget estimates that the 10-year cost of the
legislation and executive actions President Trump signed into law was
about $8.4 trillion, with interest. </p>
<p>‘Definition of unsustainable’</p>
<p>Michael A. Peterson, CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, said
the CBO projections show that the outlook for America’s critical
national debt challenge is worsening. </p>
<p>“The harmful effects of higher interest rates fueling higher interest
costs on a huge existing debt load are continuing and leading to
additional borrowing. It’s the definition of unsustainable,” Peterson
said. </p>
<p>“The leaders we elect this fall will face a series of highly
consequential fiscal deadlines next year, including the reinstatement of
the debt limit, the expiration of the 2017 tax cuts and key decisions on
health care subsidies, discretionary spending caps and more.”</p>

<h2 id="kde-plasma-6.1-released">KDE Plasma 6.1 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>After the very successful release of KDE Plasma 6.0, which moved the
entire desktop environment and most of its applications over to Qt 6,
fixed a whole slow of bugs, and streamlined the entire KDE desktop and
its applications, it’s now time for KDE Plasma 6.1, where we’re going to
see a much stronger focus on new features. While it’s merely a point
release, it’s still a big one. The tentpole new feature of Plasma 6.1 is
access to remote Plasma desktops. You can go into Settings and log into
any Plasma desktop, which is built entirely and directly into KDE’s own
Wayland compositor, avoiding the use of third party applications of
hacky extensions to X.org. Having such remote access built right into
the desktop environment and its compositor itself is a much cleaner
implementation than in the before time with X. Another feature that
worked just fine under X but was still missing from KDE Plasma on
Wayland is something they now call “persistent applications” –
basically, KDE will now remember which windows you had open when you
closed KDE or shut down your computer, and open them back up right where
you left off when you log back in. It’s one of those things that got
lost in the transition to Wayland, and having it back is really, really
welcome. Speaking of Wayland, KDE Plasma 6.1 also introduces two major
new rendering features. Explicit sync removes flickering and glitches
most commonly seen on NVIDIA hardware, while triple buffering provides
smoother animations and screen rendering. There’s more here, too, such
as a completely reworked edit desktop view, support for controlling
keyboard LED backlighting traditionally found in gaming laptops, and
more. KDE Plasma 6.1 will find its way to your distribution of choice
soon enough, but of course, you can compile and install it yourself,
too.</p>

<h2 id="the-history-of-dr-dos">The history of DR-DOS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’ve always found the world of DOS versions and variants to be
confusing, since most of it took place when I was very young (I’m from
1984) so I wasn’t paying much attention to computing quite yet, other
than playing DOS games. One of the variants of DOS I never quite
understood where it was from until much, much later, was DR-DOS. To this
day, I pronounce this as “Doctor DOS”. If you’re also a little unclear
on what, exactly, DR-DOS was, Bradford Morgan White has an excellent
article detailing the origins and history of DR-DOS, making it very easy
to get up to speed and expand your knowledge on DOS, which is surely a
very marketable skill in the days of Electron and Electron for
Developers. DR DOS was a great product. It was superior to other DOS
versions in many ways, and it is certainly possible that it could have
been more successful were it not for Microsoft Windows having been so
wildly successful. Starting with Windows 95, the majority of computer
users simply didn’t much care about which DOS loaded Windows so long as
it worked. There’s quite a bit of lore regarding legal battles and
copyrights surrounding CP/M and DOS involving Microsoft and Digital
Research. This has been covered in previous articles to some extent, but
I am not really certain how much would have changed had Microsoft and
Digital Research got on. Gates and Kildall had been quite friendly at
one point, and we know that the two mutually chose not to work together
due to differences in business practices and beliefs. Kildall chose to
be quite a bit more friendly and less competitive while Gates very much
chose to be competitive and at times a bit ruthless. Additionally,
Kildall sold DRI rather than continue the fight, and DRI had never
really attempted to combine DR DOS with GEM as a cohesive product to
fight Windows before Windows became the ultimate ruler of the OS market
following Windows 3.1’s release. Still, it was an absolutely brilliant
product and part of me will always feel that it ought to have won. ↫
Bradford Morgan White I can definitely imagine an alternative timeline
in which Digital Research managed to combine DR-DOS with GEM in a more
attractive way, stealing Microsoft’s thunder before Gates’ balls got
rolling properly with Windows 3.x. It’s one of the many, many what-ifs
in this sector, but not one you often hear or read about.</p>

id="adobes-hidden-cancellation-fee-is-unlawful-ftc-suit-says">Adobe’s
hidden cancellation fee is unlawful, FTC suit says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>To lock subscribers into recurring monthly payments, Adobe would
typically pre-select by default its most popular “annual paid monthly”
plan, the FTC alleged. That subscription option locked users into an
annual plan despite paying month to month. If they canceled after a
two-week period, they’d owe Adobe an early termination fee (ETF) that
costs 50 percent of their remaining annual subscription. The “material
terms” of this fee are hidden during enrollment, the FTC claimed, only
appearing in “disclosures that are designed to go unnoticed and that
most consumers never see.” ↫ Ashley Belanger at Ars Technica There’s a
sucker for every corporation, but I highly doubt there’s anyone out
there who would consider this a fair business practice. This is so
obviously designed to hide costs during sign-up, and then unveil them
when the user considers quitting. If this is deemed legal or allowed,
you can expect everyone to jump on this bandwagon to scam users out of
their money. It goes further than this, though. According to the FTC,
Adobe knew this practice was shady, but continued it anyway because
altering it would negatively affect the bottom line. The FTC is actually
targeting two Adobe executives directly, which is always nice to hear –
it’s usually management that pushes such illegal practices through,
leaving the lower ranks little choice but to comply or lose their job.
Stuff like this is exactly why confidence in the major technology
companies is at an all-time low.</p>

id="journalist-finally-recognized-for-work-combating-russian-disinformation">Journalist
finally recognized for work combating Russian disinformation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington    — The U.S. Embassy in Finland this month presented
journalist Jessikka Aro with the Ambassador Hickey Woman of Courage
Award. </p>
<p>The honor — tailored specifically for Aro — comes five years after
the U.S. State Department rescinded its courage award because of
critical comments the Finnish journalist made about then-President
Donald Trump.  </p>
<p>The embassy presented its award in recognition of Aro’s commitment to
exposing and combating Russian disinformation campaigns at great
personal cost. For a decade, she has been at the forefront of
investigating Russian information warfare and pro-Kremlin troll
farms. </p>
<p>“I still can’t believe that I actually got [the award],” Aro told VOA
from Finland’s capital, Helsinki. “I felt utterly supported. I felt
utterly appreciated. I felt really honored.” </p>
<p>In 2019, U.S. officials informed Aro that she would receive that
year’s International Women of Courage Award. A few weeks later, she was
told there had been a mistake and she would not receive the prestigious
honor. Back then, Aro reported for Finland’s public service broadcaster
YLE. </p>
<p>At the time, officials publicly denied that Aro’s social media posts
about Trump were the reason. But a 2020 report by the State Department’s
Office of Inspector General found that officials revoked the award over
Aro’s comments.  </p>
<p>The report cited a post on Twitter, now X, in which Aro wrote that
“Trump constantly labels journalists as ‘enemy’ and ‘fake news.’” She
then cited an article about a Trump supporter who threatened to shoot
reporters for The Boston Globe for being what Trump described as
“enemies of the people” and “fake news.” </p>
<p>Throughout his presidency, Trump regularly referred to the media as
the “enemy” of the American people. The Trump presidential campaign did
not reply to VOA’s email requesting comment.</p>
<p>In 2020, the Washington-based International Women’s Media Foundation
(IWMF) awarded Aro its own Courage in Journalism Award. The organization
also advocated for an investigation into why the State Department
backtracked on its award. </p>
<p>The new award from the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki comes at a meaningful
time for Aro. This year marks a decade since she began facing severe
online harassment — including death threats — over her coverage of
Russian information warfare. The harassment, which mainly comes from
Russian and Finnish actors, is ongoing, she said.  </p>
<p>“My work is being attacked, myself smeared. Some of my sources are
smeared,” said Aro, who is now the communications director for the
Finnish trade union Tehy. “They are spreading these seeds of mistrust
against my person and my work.”  </p>
<p>Trolls also attacked her after the State Department rescinded its
award, sparking “a massive wave” of harassment, she said.  </p>
<p>Such attacks are consistent with the broader trend of
disproportionate online harassment against female journalists, according
to Elisa Lees Munoz, executive director of the IWMF. Online attacks
against female journalists are often sexualized and can include rape
threats and insults about the reporter’s appearance, Munoz said.  </p>
<p>“It leads to symptoms that are very similar to PTSD, and that even
though these attacks are happening virtually, they have very serious,
real-life impacts,” she said.  </p>
<p>In a 2022 survey by the International Center for Journalists and
UNESCO, nearly three-quarters of respondents identifying as women said
they had experienced online violence. </p>
<p>When Aro first began to face online harassment in 2014, “it actually
fueled my will to investigate Russian trolls,” she said. “Even nowadays,
on a daily basis, I think of it as proof that I’m doing a great
job.” </p>
<p>Aro admits the harassment has also taken a toll. But she says she’ll
never let it get in the way of her work. </p>
<p>“Investigating Russian information hybrid warfare is a true calling
for me,” she said.  </p>
<p>Although it’s five years late, Aro says she feels vindicated. The
investigative journalist is currently working on her third book about
Russian information warfare, which she expects to be published in
2026.</p>

Qualcomm and Microsoft have made big claims for the new Snapdragon X
Elite processors that power some of the first Copilot+ PCs that are
available starting today. Now that the first reviews are starting to
arrive, do they live up to the promise? In some ways yes. In others?
No. Or at least not yet. […]

Influencers Aren’t Getting Rich—They’re Barely Getting By</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;known-bookmark&quot;&gt;

[<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/social-media-influencers-arent-getting-richtheyre-barely-getting-by-71e0aad3?st=snqhy92nimb59t6">Sarah
E. Needleman and Ann-Marie Alcántara at the Wall Street Journal</a>]
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Earning a decent, reliable income as a social-media creator is a
slog—and it’s getting harder. Platforms are doling out less money for
popular posts and brands are being pickier about what they want out of
sponsorship deals.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
For many kids, becoming an influencer has become the new becoming a
sports star: in enormous numbers, it’s what they want to be. More
broadly, if you dare to say that it’s not a real job, you’re likely to
be drowned out by complaints and contradictions.
</p>
<p>
But it isn’t, and this article makes it clear:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Last year, 48% of creator-earners made $15,000 or less, according to
NeoReach, an influencer marketing agency. Only 13% made more than
$100,000.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Of course, some people really did shoot to fame and have been doing
really well. But there aren’t many Mr Beasts or Carli D’Amelios of this
world, and the lure of being famous has trapped less lucky would-be
influencers in cycles of debt and mental illness.
</p>
<p>
This is despite having sometimes enormous followings: hundreds of
thousands to millions of people, with hundreds of millions of views a
month. The economics of the platforms are such that even at those
numbers, you can barely scrape by.
</p>
<p>
I like the advice that, instead, you should cultivate a genuine
expertise and use social media to promote offsite services you provide
around that. It might be that a following can land you a better job, or
help you build up a consultancy. Trying to make money from ads and brand
sponsorships is a losing game - and thousands of people are losing big.

Crux, the New York-based startup that helps companies trade clean energy

this morning that it has secured strategic investments from some of the
largest energy developers, including Clearway Energy, Intersect Power,
Pattern Energy, and Électricité de France. “We had an opportunity to

utilities rarely need to use all the tax credits they generate from

forecasts that $7 to $9 billion of these new “transferrable tax credits”
will be sold in that new market this year (with huge potential for

Quebec, Canada, by carbon removal startup Equatic in partnership with
Deep Sky, a Canadian-based developer of carbon removal projects. Equatic
uses electrolysis on seawater to trap carbon both in the ocean and in
the air. The process also creates clean hydrogen, which the company
plans to sell, and use to power its own technology. Equatic already has
two pilot plants – one in Los Angeles and another in Singapore. It says
that in its first year, the commercial-scale plant will remove 109,500
metric tons of CO2 and produce 3,600 metric tons of green hydrogen, and
help bring the cost of carbon dioxide removal down below the key
benchmark of $100 per metric ton by 2030.

<p class="drop-caps">
One of the least-noticed changes in the Inflation Reduction Act may be
one of the most important.
</p>
<p>
For years, the government has encouraged developers, power utilities,
and other companies to build clean energy by offering tax credits. But
those tax credits were difficult to transfer to other companies, meaning
that complicated financial instruments had to be created to allow them
to share in the wealth.
</p>
<p>
The IRA continues to employ tax credits. But for the first time, it
allows companies to buy and sell tax credits to each other.
</p>
<p>
A new crop of startups have appeared to help companies trade these new
“transferable” tax credits. One of the largest is
<a href="https://www.cruxclimate.com/" target="_blank">Crux</a>, a New
York-based startup backed by
<a href="https://a16z.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Andreessen
Horowitz</u></a> and
<a href="https://lowercarboncapital.com/" target="_blank"><u>Lowercarbon
Capital</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
On Tuesday, Crux announced that it has now brought some of the country’s
largest energy developers into its fold.
<a href="https://www.clearwayenergygroup.com/" target="_blank">Clearway
Energy</a>,
<a href="https://www.intersectpower.com/" target="_blank">Intersect
Power</a>, <a href="https://patternenergy.com/" target="_blank">Pattern
Energy</a>, and
<a href="https://www.edf.fr/en" target="_blank">Électricité de
France</a> (commonly known as EDF) have all made strategic investments
in Crux, the company announced. It had not previously disclosed their
involvement in January’s $18.2 million Series A round.
</p>
<p>
“We had an opportunity to bring in some of the leading developers who
collectively represent a pipeline of more than 100 gigawatts of power,”
Alfred Johnson, Crux’s CEO, told me.
</p>
<p>
Crux has now raised more than $27 million in capital since its founding
early last year. The offshore wind developer Orsted, as well as the
energy developers LS Power and Hartree, have previously joined as
strategic investors.
</p>
<p>
Under the Inflation Reduction Act, as in the past, companies can claim
money on their taxes by building zero-carbon electricity generation, new
factories, buying electric vehicles, and more.<br/>
</p>
<p>
But energy developers and utilities rarely need to use all the tax
credits that they generate from their projects. A $30 million solar farm
might generate as much as $10 million of tax credits, for instance — far
too much for most companies to use in a reasonable amount of time.
</p>
<p>
That meant that developers had to bring in a third-party firm — usually
a bank or another financial institution — that could pay for the
privilege of using those tax credits. Before the IRA passed, many clean
energy projects were therefore structured as complicated “tax equity”
deals, where the bank or tax credit “buyer” owned part of the project so
that it could claim its tax credits. About $20 billion in tax equity
deals happened last year, according to
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/blog/banking-essentials-newsletter-may-29th-edition" target="_blank"><u>research</u></a>
from the law firm Norton Rose Fulbright.
</p>
<p>
The IRA aimed to make that process easier by, in essence, creating a
market for tax credits.
</p>
<p>
Crux estimates that $7 to $9 billion of these new “transferrable tax
credits” were sold in that new market last year. It believes that the
opportunity will grow rapidly. The advisory firm Evercore has projected
that the transferrable tax credit market
<a href="https://www.cruxclimate.com/insights/evercore-market-report-clean-energy-tax-credits#:~:text=Evercore's%20research%20indicates%20that%20the,billion%20per%20year%20in%202030." target="_blank"><u>could
exceed $100 billion</u></a> by 2030.
</p>
<p>
Crux is not the only company that hopes to capitalize on that burgeoning
market, potentially speeding the energy transition at the same time.
<a href="https://www.buildwithbasis.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Basis
Climate</a>, another New York-based startup, is also trying to serve as
a key platform in the space.
</p>
<p>
Ilmi Granoff is an expert on climate finance, a senior fellow at the
Sabin Center for Climate Law, and an advisor to Basis Climate. “The
market is going to be diverse and large enough to support a number of
pure play platforms that are specialists in this — and you’re going to
have the banks moving in, consultancies, the tax advisors, and more,”
Granoff told me. “For those looking for an environmental commodities
market that really drives climate change, you can stop looking at the
voluntary carbon market and just monetize the tax credit market for
carbon solutions. It is going to be a very reliable market, backed by
the government.”
</p>
<p>
Johnson, the Crux chief executive, also pointed to the scale of
climate-related investment on the horizon. “We just have to build so
much in the next 10 years. The level of infrastructure investments that
have happened up to this point — and the scale of what will be built —
is really, really dramatic,” Johnson said.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Crux’s product is a standardized platform where developers, utilities,
and manufacturing companies can describe and sell their tax credits to
buyers.
</p>
<p>
When a buyer first uses Crux, all tax credits available on the service
are presented anonymously. They can then anonymously contact a specific
seller. The buyer and seller can gradually reveal information to each
other throughout the ensuing negotiation, culminating in a Crux-hosted
“data room” where each teams’ accountants and lawyers can trade and view
documents relevant to the sale.
</p>
<p>
“This is not a point and click transaction,” Johnson told me. “These are
still complicated transactions with lots of moving pieces, with many
underlying documents and lots of stakeholders at the table.” The goal of
Crux, he said, is to make these transactions “efficient and
standardized.”
</p>
<p>
The company says it’s already having some success speeding up the
average sale. It recently facilitated a deal between an electricity
utility, which was selling tax credits, and a Fortune 100 company, which
was buying them, in just 22 days, Johnson told me. By contrast, a
traditional tax equity deal would take six to nine months to structure
and close, he said.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Many of the company’s leaders once helped shape high-level
Democratic policy. Johnson, a former White House aide under President
Barack Obama, was deputy chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Janet
Yellen until 2022. He and Crux’s cofounder, Allen Kramer, previously
cofounded the startup Mobilize, which helped organizations manage and
recruit volunteers.
</p>
<p>
William Daley, a former Obama White House chief of staff and Commerce
Secretary under President Bill Clinton,
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cruxclimate_crux-appoints-william-m-daley-as-senior-activity-7204457116462444545-IY6M" target="_blank"><u>joined</u></a>
Crux as a senior advisor last week.
</p>
<p>
In an interview, Daley told me that — with the defense industry excepted
— he could not remember the government investing in a strategic industry
the way it is now investing in clean energy. “These are economic
decisions that investors are making — they’re not just going out there
and doing things that may or may not be financially rewarding,” he told
me. “For every dollar the government puts forward in a subsidy or
credit, the private sector is investing $5.”

<h2 id="india-us-to-strengthen-high-technology-cooperation">India, US to
strengthen high technology cooperation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New Delhi — Days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi began his third
term in office, India and the United States agreed to strengthen
cooperation in high technology areas during a visit by White House
national security adviser Jake Sullivan to New Delhi.</p>
<p>Sullivan met Modi, the Indian foreign minister and his Indian
counterpart during the visit that reaffirmed both countries will pursue
closer ties.</p>
<p>“India is committed to further strengthen the India-US comprehensive
global strategic partnership for global good,” Modi wrote on X after
meeting Sullivan on Monday.</p>
<p>The main focus of Sullivan’s visit was to hold discussion with Indian
National Security Adviser Ajit Doval on a landmark initiative launched
by the two countries in January last year to collaborate more closely in
high-technology areas including defense, semiconductors, 5G wireless
networks and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The initiative, launched with an eye to countering China, marks a
significant push in tightening the strategic partnership between the two
countries.</p>
<p>“The visit by Sullivan in the early days of Modi’s new administration
signals that the U.S. wants to maintain the momentum in the high
technology partnership between the two countries,” according to Manoj
Joshi, Distinguished Fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New
Delhi.</p>
<p>A joint fact sheet by the two countries following Sullivan’s meeting
with Doval said that they launched a new strategic semiconductor
partnership between U.S. and Indian companies for precision-guided
ammunition and other national security-focused electronics
platforms.</p>
<p>They also agreed to co-invest in a lithium resource project in South
America and a rare earths deposit in Africa “to diversify critical
mineral supply chains” and discussed possible co-production of land
warfare systems, according to the fact sheet.</p>
<p>Growing the domestic defense manufacturing sector remains a top focus
for the Modi administration as it looks to lower its dependence on
imported arms. Although India has diversified its imports of military
equipment, it is still heavily reliant on Russia.</p>
<p>For India, the technology initiative is a top priority as it looks to
strengthen the country’s security and build its capabilities in high
technology areas.</p>
<p>“India wants to become one of the leading countries in cutting edge
technologies and it is of great benefit for New Delhi to partner the
U.S. which is the leader in these areas,” said Joshi. “The idea is to
get into co-production, co-development, innovation and attract American
companies to set up bases here.”</p>
<p>Sullivan also met Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyan Jaishankar,
who has been retained as the external affairs minister in Modi’s new
administration, signaling a continuation in the country’s foreign
policy. “Confident that India-US strategic partnership will continue to
advance strongly in our new term,” Jaishankar wrote on X.</p>
<p>In Washington, White House National Security Communications Advisor
John Kirby told reporters Monday that India and the U.S. “share a unique
bond of friendship and Mr. Sullivan’s trip to India will further deepen
the already strong U.S.-India partnership to create a safer and more
prosperous Indo-Pacific.”</p>
<p>New Delhi’s ties with Washington have expanded in recent years amid
mutual concerns in both countries about an assertive China – India’s
military standoff with Beijing along their disputed Himalayan borders
remains unresolved four years after a clash between their troops.</p>
<p>As Sullivan visited India, an Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, charged
with trying to hire a hitman to assassinate a Sikh separatist leader in
the U.S., appeared in court in New York Monday following his extradition
from the Czech Republic. The alleged plan was foiled.</p>
<p>Allegations by U.S. prosecutors of the involvement of an Indian
government official in the plot to kill Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a dual
US-Canadian citizen, have raised concerns about a strain in bilateral
ties.</p>
<p>The U.S. allegations followed accusations leveled by Canada in
September of involvement of Indian nationals in the killing of a
Canadian Sikh leader.</p>
<p>India, which views Sikh separatist groups overseas as security
threats, has denied its involvement in both the killing in Canada and
the alleged plot in the U.S. But it said it has set up an inquiry
committee to examine the information provided by Washington.</p>
<p>Analysts in New Delhi say ties are unlikely to be adversely impacted
by the alleged murder plot. “The U.S. is quite pragmatic on these
matters. They are continuing to stress that ties with India are
important, so I don’t think a failed conspiracy will derail ties,” Joshi
said.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Two years ago, John Podesta met with Jennifer Granholm, the U.S.
Secretary of Energy. Podesta, a longtime Democratic aide, had just
started a new role in the Biden administration, overseeing the Inflation
Reduction Act’s implementation, and he was going to meet with Granholm
about high-priority clean electricity infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
First on the agenda was a list of transmission projects to ferry
electricity from wind and solar farms to cities and suburbs where it
would actually be used.
</p>
<p>
“Up pops the list,” Podesta told me later. The first project was a line
called SunZia.
</p>
<p>
“My jaw dropped,” he said. “I thought we solved that in 2014!”
</p>
<p>
No, no, Granholm said. There had been twists and turns. But now it was
back.
</p>
<p>
If you want to understand why the United States can’t build
infrastructure, look at SunZia.
</p>
<p>
Envisioned as a roughly 550-mile high-voltage transmission line
connecting a sprawling 900-turbine wind farm in central New Mexico to
the growing cities of Arizona and California, SunZia is — according to
its developer — one of the largest electricity projects in American
history. When it’s finished, the line will deliver 4,500 megawatts of
electricity to consumers. Only two power plants nationwide produce more:
the Grand Coulee Dam in Washington, and the Vogtle nuclear power plant
in Georgia.
</p>
<p>
“It’s the largest clean energy project in America, and I think the
largest clean energy project in <em><em>the Americas</em></em>,” Podesta
told me. “It’s huge.”
</p>
<p>
For nearly two decades, SunZia has bounced through successive stages of
regulatory review, financial restructuring, and litigation. It has been
fought over, bought, sold, and at one point, forcibly relocated by the
Department of Defense. Today, 18 years after it was first conceived, it
is finally under construction. At least one outstanding lawsuit is
contesting its right of way. If all goes according to the current plan,
SunZia will begin to deliver power to consumers in 2026.
</p>
<p>
SunZia’s timeline would present an inconvenience — arguably an
embarrassment — in any context. In this particular context, it could
even invoke despair. “It’s a classic example of how we’ve gotten
excellent at stopping things in America, and if we’re going to take the
climate crisis seriously, we have to get excellent at building things in
America,” Podesta said.
</p>
<p>
The stakes are far larger than electricity bills. The United States has
pledged to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Reaching
that target will require tripling the size of America’s power grid in
the next 26 years, according to Princeton University’s Net Zero America
study. If America were to power its grid entirely with renewable energy
— a feat that many experts doubt is possible — then it would need a grid
<em><em>five times </em></em>as large as what it has now.
</p>
<p>
Even if that study (led by
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-robinson-meyer-jesse-jenkins-climate-podcast" target="_self"><u>my
podcast co-host</u></a>, Jesse Jenkins) overstates the need for new
transmission, the mechanics of renewables dictate that the country must
hook up its existing grid to the places where the sun shines brightest
and the wind blows hardest. The Desert Southwest — and New Mexico
specifically — features some of America’s richest
<a href="https://www.nrel.gov/gis/solar-resource-maps.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>solar</u></a>
and
<a href="https://www.nrel.gov/gis/wind-resource-maps.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wind</u></a>
resources. To decarbonize America, that energy must be harvested and
transported from these largely unpopulated areas to the dense urban
centers where people actually live.
</p>
<p>
That is easier said than done. Although transmission projects are
unusually important for climate change, they are also unusually
difficult to build, especially compared to fossil fuel infrastructure.
Or, well, not difficult to <em><em>build, </em></em>exactly — it’s just
a big power line, and we know how to put those up — but difficult to
<em><em>get permission </em></em>to build. Ultimately, that permission
is in the hands of the government. But when it comes to long, linear
infrastructure projects like power lines, there isn’t really a single
“government” to talk about it with in the first place.
</p>
<p>
To build a transmission line, a developer has to secure permission from
every state, county, city, and property owner along the route. If any of
them denies the project, poison-pills it with endless requirements, or
even sits on an application, then the entire project stalls. (Building a
natural gas pipeline, by contrast, requires getting permission only from
a single federal agency.) Electricity utilities don’t usually like
transmission lines because they erode their local monopoly over power
generation and distribution. Those utilities have such great influence
at the state and local level — through outright lobbying and by funding
local Little League teams, churches, and more — that they can often
convince politicians and regulators to slow down or block a line.
</p>
<p>
For these reasons and more, America’s rate of new transmission
construction
<a href="https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/podcast/americas-electric-power-transmission-crisis/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
plummeted</u></a> over the past few decades. In this history of stasis,
though, SunZia presents a special case. SunZia is such a high-profile
project that its enormous delays have terrified the rest of its small
industry. If SunZia was defeated nearly 20 years after it was first
proposed, then it could render the field un-investable, one investor
confided to me.
</p>
<p>
Yet for all the hand wringing, SunZia is a success story. It has now
fought off its most credible lawsuits, meaning that it is likely to get
built. Within two years, huge amounts of climate-friendly electricity
could be coursing through the American desert.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, I went to Arizona to examine more closely why SunZia
has been so difficult to build and what finally allowed it to move
forward. I spoke to the SunZia’s developer and the environmentalists who
support the project — as well as those who oppose it. The question I was
trying to answer: What did it get right? If America is going to reach
its climate goals, learning those lessons — and learning them well — is
going to be crucial. When SunZia is completed and running at full blast,
it will generate roughly 1% of the country’s electricity needs. After
that, to fully decarbonize the electricity sector, we will need to run
it all back 99 more times.
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
The saga of SunZia begins in the summer of 2006, when representatives
from utilities, developers, and government agencies from across the
Southwest gathered to discuss expanding the region’s power grid. After
looking at energy and economic data, the group decided that Arizona and
New Mexico needed a powerful new transmission line to connect the
swelling populations in the west with New Mexico’s abundant wind and
solar potential.
</p>
<p>
The Southwest Power Group, a Phoenix-based energy company that had
attended the conference, soon put together an ownership team of four
utilities and stepped in to lead the project. They christened the line
“SunZia,” after the setting sun on
<a href="https://azlibrary.gov/state-arizona-flag" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Arizona’s
flag</u></a> and the sign of the Zia people on
<a href="https://www.sos.nm.gov/about-new-mexico/state-flag/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>New
Mexico’s flag</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
In June 2008, Southwest Power Group applied to the Bureau of Land
Management, or the BLM, the national agency tasked with managing federal
lands, for the right to build a major new transmission line across the
two states. “Local, state, and federal permitting efforts will begin
immediately,” the coalition announced in an optimistic press release.
</p>
<p>
The first phase of SunZia was expected to initiate commercial operation
by 2013, the developers added.
</p>
<p>
Back then, when a developer tried to build a transmission line, they had
a strong but not definitive sense of the route — in part because the
federal government could ask them to change it if needed. Under the
National Environmental Policy Act, the government must study how
infrastructure projects — or, really, <em><em>any </em></em>federal
action — affect the environment, inviting input from local governments,
environmental groups, and nearby Native American nations. (That law does
not require the government to <em><em>protect</em></em> the environment
in any substantive way; it simply requires that it consult everyone and
study a project’s impact.)

<p>
Southwest Power Group knew that SunZia would begin in central New
Mexico, southeast of Albuquerque, and that it would eventually connect
to a large-scale renewable project there. (At the time, the vast wind
farm hadn’t yet been planned.) Then it would proceed due west, passing
below Albuquerque, before veering southwest and passing north of the
White Sands Missile Range. After that, SunZia would turn west again,
eventually crossing into Arizona. It would pass near Tucson, Arizona —
the exact route was uncertain — before finally turning north again and
terminating in a substation in Phoenix’s southeastern suburbs. From
there, the existing grid could ferry electricity into Phoenix or further
toward California.<br/>
</p>
<p>
This route presented many difficulties, but two river crossings
dominated concerns over the project.
</p>
<p>
First, SunZia had to cross the Rio Grande. Although that river is
best-known back East for forming the U.S.-Mexico border, it begins in
the Colorado Rockies and flows in a southerly direction through New
Mexico, bisecting the state. In other words, you cannot cross New Mexico
without crossing the river.
</p>
<p>
The Rio Grande creates an environment in New Mexico unlike anywhere else
in the United States: a high-desert wetlands, where hundreds of
thousands of birds from across North America spend the winter. The BLM
and the Southwest Power Group decided that SunZia would shoot through a
small gap between two wildlife refuges — the Sevilleta National Wildlife
Refuge to the north, and the Bosque Del Apache National Wildlife Refuge
to the south — that had been formed to protect these birds.
</p>
<p>
Second, SunZia would have to pass near Tucson, Arizona by one of three
routes, each of which required some kind of sacrifice. The first option
involved running the line alongside an existing 345 kilovolt
transmission line that passed to the city’s south and west. But the city
and county opposed that route, and it required securing a permit to
cross the Tohono O’odham Nation’s land, which the tribe refused to
allow.
</p>
<p>
That left two remaining routes. One option ran near the center of
Tucson, passing very close to overwhelmingly poor and Latino
neighborhoods. This route raised “environmental justice” concerns, the
BLM said, in that it forced poor people of color who already live
alongside energy infrastructure to bear even greater environmental costs
for it. The other choice was to run SunZia east of Tucson and through
the beautiful San Pedro Valley, one of the most pristine desert
ecosystems remaining in Arizona. Although vast swaths of that valley are
privately owned, Native American relics and cultural sites dot its
landscape.
</p>
<p>
Forced to choose between harming civil rights or damaging the
environment, the BLM reluctantly chose the latter. But to blunt some of
the damage to the valley, the bureau directed the developers to follow
existing pipelines or transmission lines for more than 40% of its
mileage. It also ordered SunZia to commission studies of archeological
sites along the route’s path so they could be mitigated or avoided
entirely. (SunZia would later adjust its route to avoid some of the most
archaeologically sensitive sites.)
</p>
<p>
Studying these options took much longer than the Southwest Power Group
had ever imagined. The Bureau of Land Management published its final
environmental study on SunZia in June 2013 — the same year SunZia was
once due to begin operation. Southwest Power Group was finally ready to
start construction. Then the Pentagon stepped in.
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
Scarcely a month after SunZia’s course was finalized through New Mexico,
the Pentagon filed a
<a href="https://www.nextgov.com/digital-government/2013/09/senator-wants-mit-study-pentagon-opposed-power-line-white-sands/70692/?oref=ng-next-story" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>formal
protest</u></a>. The approved route passed way too close to the White
Sands Missile Range, the complaint said, and the BLM had “not adequately
analyzed the significant risks to national security” that would result
from building it.
</p>
<p>
The White Sands Missile Range is the country’s largest military
installation and is vital to New Mexico’s economy. By suggesting that
SunZia might imperil the base’s activities, the Pentagon was at risk of
killing the project. But something about that claim didn’t sit right
with Senator Martin Heinrich, a first-term Democrat and former
Albuquerque city councilman. Heinrich was an engineer by training, and
his father had been a utility lineman, giving him at least some
familiarity with how the power grid worked. Why did a big power line
threaten the military base miles away?
He<a href="https://www.nextgov.com/digital-government/2013/09/senator-wants-mit-study-pentagon-opposed-power-line-white-sands/70692/?oref=ng-next-story" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
<u>asked</u></a> MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory to investigate whether the
line would damage the base as much as the Pentagon said.
</p>
<p>
Six months later, in March 2014, the study was completed. According to
<a href="https://interferencetechnology.com/mit-study-sparks-white-sands-sunzia-interference-debate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>news
stories</u></a> at the time, the classified study found that SunZia
<em><em>would</em></em> impair the base’s activities, but that its
effects could be mitigated. After months of intense negotiations with
the White House, the Pentagon, the Department of the Interior, and
Senator Heinrich’s office, Southwest Power Group agreed to bury five
miles of the power line — an expensive solution, but one that would
allow the project to move forward.
</p>
<p>
By that point, however, SunZia had captured the public’s attention and
polarized New Mexicans. The state’s Republicans gleefully undermined the
project in the press. As the Obama administration prepared to approve
the line, a Republican congressman and former oil company CEO
<a href="https://www.krwg.org/local-viewpoints/2015-01-23/pearce-sunzia-decision-endangers-the-nation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>intoned</u></a>
that SunZia would “permanently damage” national security.
</p>
<p>
“Greenlighting the completion of SunZia along the chosen route is a
reckless rush to judgment without thorough examination,” the
congressman, Steve Pearce, said. (The federal government had, by this
point, been studying SunZia for seven years.) He worried too that the
line would “potentially destroy ancient Pueblo sites.”
</p>
<p>
In 2015, the Obama administration finally approved SunZia’s route. After
nearly a decade, Southwest Power Group had the federal government’s
permission to build SunZia.
</p>
<p>
But that was only the first step: Now, the company had to secure state
and local permits. That would prove even more confounding.
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
The truth is that New Mexico’s environmentalists had never been
comfortable with what SunZia would mean for the state’s wildlife. They
hated the Rio Grande crossing. They were particularly stressed about
what the structure might mean for
<a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Sandhill_Crane/overview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sandhill
cranes</u></a>, a regal and crimson-headed bird that migrates to New
Mexico from as far away as Alaska and Siberia. Few sights are more
treasured by the region’s birders than the vast flocks of cranes that
form in the Bosque del Apache Wildlife Refuge each winter.
</p>
<p>
Birders imagined that SunZia’s towers and low-hanging wires could maim
or kill the elegant cranes. <em><em>If SunZia could bury the line to
help White Sands Missile Range, </em></em>people asked, <em><em>why
couldn’t they also bury it below the Rio Grande and save some birds?
</em></em>They whispered, too, that the line would transmit not
wind-generated electricity as promised, but rather gas-fired electricity
from a power plant owned by Southwest Power Group.
</p>
<p>
When Southwest Power Group applied for a state permit to cross the Rio
Grande, the birders’ moment came. The developers were still finalizing
construction details and didn’t seem to have a strong sense of where
exactly the line would go. In 2018, New Mexico’s utility commission
<a href="https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/local/new-mexico/2018/09/06/prc-rejects-sunzia-transmission-line-project/1211636002/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rejected</u></a>
the permit and asked the Southwest Power Group to come back with more
information.
</p>
<p>
SunZia was flailing. Building the line had taken much longer than
Southwest Power Group had ever envisioned. Burying the line, even for a
few miles, had made it a much more costly project. Now environmentalists
doubted that it would help fight climate change at all and were making
increasingly expensive demands.
</p>
<p>
Then a new company came into the picture: Pattern Energy, a San
Francisco-based energy developer partially owned by Canadian pension
funds. Pattern promised to build a vast wind farm — comprising more than
900 turbines — at SunZia’s eastern end. It became the line’s “anchor
tenant,” in the jargon of energy developers, and, more importantly, the
project’s public face.
</p>
<p>
“They came in, and they were quite honestly pretty frustrated with the
way that [the SunZia project] had approached community engagement and
talking with environmental groups,” Jon Hayes, a wildlife biologist and
the executive director of Audubon Southwest, told me. Up to that point,
SunZia had been the story of an “industry just trying to push their
lowest-cost alternative through sensitive areas,” he said.
</p>
<p>
But Pattern behaved differently. “Why it was a success is that Pattern
acted and negotiated it in good faith with us,” Hayes said.
</p>
<p>
Pattern hired researchers to study how and where the cranes fly. It
agreed to install infrared lights on SunZia’s towers as an “avian
avoidance system” that will be visible to cranes and make the lines
shimmer in the dark. It bought a nearby farm to create a sandhill crane
reservation (the cranes also eat corn from the fields) and donated the
water rights to local conservation organizations. When a coalition of
environmentalists, including Audubon, asked it to study the benefits of
burying SunZia, Pattern warned that doing so could permanently alter the
project’s economics — but they studied it anyway. Burying the line would
ultimately have been more disruptive than building lines, Hayes said.
</p>
<p>
Heinrich’s office continued its involvement in the negotiation and also
helped move the process along. Environmental groups that had initially
opposed the project switched their allegiance, Audubon Southwest
included.
</p>
<p>
Pattern’s research led it to conclude that the line should be moved
<em>into</em> Serivetta National Wildlife Refuge so it could be
co-located with another transmission line. (Moving it inside the refuge
would also, counterintuitively, avoid the largest bird populations.)
When Pattern brought the new route to local environmentalists and the
Audubon Society, the conservationists agreed. Pattern then took the
extraordinary step of applying to the BLM for a new route through New
Mexico. By adopting the new route, SunZia could also avoid the White
Sands Missile Range entirely, avoiding the costly need to bury the line.
</p>
<p>
Cary Kottler, Pattern’s chief development officer, told me that the
project’s pre-existing climate credentials incentivized it to find ways
to make SunZia more environmentally sound. “I think we did figure out a
way for environmental groups to support infrastructure, which has not
always been the case in the past,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Pattern being a company that was willing to have discussions with us in
good faith — and that conversation happening before the re-permitting
process — was, I think, really important,” Hayes agreed.
</p>
<p>
Heinrich echoed that thought in a statement. “I am especially proud of
our work to engage local communities, conservation organizations, and
other stakeholders to find pathways forward while securing strong
economic and conservation benefits for New Mexico,” he told me. He also
thanked the BLM, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Pattern Energy,
for their “hard work and collaborative approach.”
</p>
<p>
“I firmly believe that when we work together, we can build big things in
this country,” the senator said. “SunZia will have a massive economic
impact in New Mexico while bringing us one major step closer to meeting
our climate goals and conserving wildlife habitat.”
</p>
<p>
In 2020, Pattern entered into a deal with New Mexico’s Renewable
Electricity Transmission Authority, a state agency meant to encourage
long-distance power lines. The deal allowed New Mexico to reap some of
the benefits of owning SunZia, and it spared SunZia from some scrutiny
under state permitting law. It had taken 14 years, but SunZia was
finally ready to build in New Mexico. It still had to tackle Arizona.
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
Pattern Energy bought SunZia outright from Southwest Power Group in
2021, and outside fundraising began to pile in. Last year, Pattern
Energy announced that it had
<a href="https://www.equipmentfa.com/news/37440/pattern-energy-closes-11b-financing-largest-u-s-clean-energy-infrastructure-project" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>secured</u></a>
$11.5 billion in financing for the line, making SunZia the largest clean
infrastructure project in dollar terms in American history.
</p>
<p>
But the line’s journey through Arizona — and specifically the San Pedro
Valley — has remained controversial.

</p>
<p>
Throughout last year, a coalition of environmental groups, local
property owners, and two tribes — the Tohono O’odham Nation and the San
Carlos Apache Tribe — pushed for the project to avoid the San Pedro
Valley, alleging that the BLM had failed to study how SunZia would
affect the landscape’s cultural value to Native Americans. In November,
the BLM
<a href="https://www.kold.com/2023/11/10/blm-pauses-sunzia-project-consult-with-tohono-oodham-nation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ordered</u></a>
Pattern Energy to pause construction on SunZia so that it could consult
with the tribes again; the groups held a series of meetings in the fall.
</p>
<p>
But the tribes deemed that effort insufficient. In January, the Tohono
O’odham and San Carlos Apache Tribe, along with the Center for
Biological Diversity and Archaeology Southwest,
<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2024/01/24/tribes-say-sunzia-power-line-threatens-san-pedro-river-sue-to-stop-work/72327977007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sued</u></a>
BLM, alleging that it had not studied how SunZia would erode the
valley’s cultural value.
</p>
<p>
Their argument turned on the interplay of two federal laws: NEPA, the
law that governs the federal permitting process; and the National
Historic Preservation Act, which says that the government must evaluate
how its actions will affect archeological sites and Native American
cultural sites.
</p>
<p>
If an infrastructure project will destroy an archeological or cultural
site, the National Historic Preservation Act says that the government
must mitigate that harm, mapping the relics and preserving what it can
from them. Pattern and the BLM say that they have followed this law.
After mapping and mitigating archaeological sites along its route, they
agreed to move the line to avoid some of the most sensitive areas.
</p>
<p>
But the tribes argue that the entire San Pedro Valley is a sensitive
cultural area. The Tohono O’odham Nation has argued in court and in the
press that SunZia abuses its cultural property not by destroying any one
cultural site, but rather by entering the San Pedro Valley in the first
place. In essence, the tribe is claiming that the entire valley is a
cultural site unto itself.
</p>
<p>
They say that the BLM must do what’s called a “cultural landscape”
study, investigating not only discrete archeological sites along the
route but the cultural value of the San Pedro Valley as a whole. “The
tribes have been trying to say that this [valley] has central cultural
and religious importance,” Robin Silver, an Arizona resident and the
cofounder of the Center for Biological Diversity, told me.
</p>
<p>
Their argument was legally daring. The federal government approved
SunZia’s route through the San Pedro Valley under NEPA in 2015, meaning
that the six-year statute of limitations for that decision had already
expired. But the National Historic Preservation Act process only wrapped
up last year. The tribes and the environmental groups argue that if
<em><em>that</em></em> law’s process had been correctly followed, then
the BLM would have been forced to change SunZia’s route — even though
doing so would essentially re-open the NEPA process.
</p>
<p>
“Pattern Energy and the Bureau of Land Management, all they do is hire
consultants that confuse hard archaeology with anthropology. So they go
out and dig in front of the bulldozers and say everything’s fine,”
Silver said. “The fact of the landforms having significant cultural and
religious importance has been here as long as the tribes have been here.
It’s just that when Manifest Destiny became the rule of law, tribal
concerns were blown off, and they’re still being blown off.”
</p>
<p>
The coalition’s argument also raised the specter of old trade-offs —
trade-offs that the tribe, by focusing on procedural and cultural
matters, did not address in its lawsuit. The San Pedro Valley is
incredibly beautiful, for instance, but it is not completely pristine:
It is already home to a large natural gas pipeline and a few smaller
transmission lines. When I asked Silver why the pipeline did not destroy
the valley, but the transmission line did, he said in essence that the
pipeline did not have the same visual impact as SunZia.
</p>
<p>
“There are no 200-foot large power lines going through the San Pedro
Valley,” he said. “The gas pipeline doesn’t have 200 foot towers.”
</p>
<p>
I pointed out that this suggested fossil fuel projects would never face
the same scrutiny as transmission lines. “We need to figure out a way to
connect the sources of our new energy to the users, and our grid is
woefully archaic. No argument,” he added. “But we don’t need to go up
every single valley, we don’t need to sacrifice everything else, because
of this mantra of climate change.”
</p>
<p>
Yet there is no way to upgrade the grid without building large
transmission towers <em><em>somewhere</em></em>. Silver suggested that
the line could be shifted back toward Tucson, but that would seemingly
place it back into the low-income, majority-Latino neighborhoods that
BLM had hoped to avoid in the first place. The other available route
would be to run SunZia west of Tucson, but that would force the line
onto Tohono O’odham Nation land. When I asked a tribal spokesperson if
the tribe had lifted its decade-old ban on SunZia crossing its land, he
didn’t respond.
</p>
<p>
In fact, the Tohono O’odham Nation has not responded to multiple emails
and calls requesting comment beginning in March.
</p>
<p>
Two weeks ago, a district court judge in Arizona tossed the tribe’s
lawsuit. She said that the statute of limitations had expired and
SunZia’s route could no longer be altered. While BLM had once suggested
that it would do a cultural landscape study on the San Pedro Valley, it
did not do so in a way that would change its obligation to the tribes,
she ruled. Silver told me that the coalition will appeal.
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
SunZia hasn’t made it out of the desert yet. It still has to clear at
least one remaining legal challenge, a lawsuit brought by the Center for
Biological Diversity and its allies in Arizona state court. But with the
federal lawsuit against it dismissed last month, SunZia now seems more
likely than ever to become complete, making it a key piece of American
zero-carbon infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
Which raises the inevitable question: Could SunZia have succeeded more
quickly? SunZia required no fundamental technological leaps or
engineering miracles; we have known <em><em>how </em></em>to build a
power line of its size and length for years. Yet just the permitting has
taken nearly two decades. If we finally get SunZia in 2026, that means
that we <em><em>could</em></em> have had it in 2016. And that means that
we <em><em>could </em></em>have burned less natural gas to meet the
country’s electricity needs, or at least enjoyed more energy, for lower
prices, with less pollution. America’s ponderous approach to building
infrastructure is often described as an economic problem. But climate
change transforms that regulatory torpor into an environmental
challenge. What can we learn from SunZia such that we never have to go
through this again?
</p>
<p>
You can see SunZia — as many in New Mexico now do — as a lesson in
different approaches to building big new infrastructure projects. Many
interests across the Southwest were unhappy with SunZia’s initial route
in 2013. But in New Mexico, the Pentagon’s formal protest to that route
led — quite happily — to Pattern Energy, Audubon Southwest, and
environmental advocates working out a better plan for everyone involved.
In Arizona, meanwhile, the old plans never changed, the same
contentiousness remained, and they ultimately gave rise to a lawsuit.
</p>
<p>
You could also see it as a lesson in political power. Silver, the Center
for Biological Diversity cofounder, told me SunZia succeeded in New
Mexico for one reason: “Martin Heinrich.” Speaking with a mix of
resentment and respect, Silver said that Heinrich pushed for
negotiations between environmentalists, clean energy advocates, tribes,
and the Defense Department, eventually nudging those groups to arrive at
a mutually agreeable outcome. In Arizona, Silver said, national and
state-level leaders have not taken the same hands-on approach, so the
process has been much more acrimonious.
</p>
<p>
There’s some truth to each of these views. To get large-scale
infrastructure projects done, it clearly helps to have a federal
chaperone — someone who can spur cities, states, tribes, and
conservation groups toward a final and constructive conclusion. The
Biden administration is playing that role now for some projects,
although it lacks local credibility, and Congress has helped to
standardize the process by creating
<a href="https://www.permits.performance.gov/projects/fast-41-covered" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
“Fast 41” process</u></a> where the government can prod along stalled
infrastructure efforts.
</p>
<p>
But there is also something substantively different in New Mexico — you
could call it high trust, good will, or a solutions-oriented approach to
problem solving. It certainly helped that Pattern Energy was willing to
work in good faith with local environmental groups. But that only works
if all the other key stakeholders, including environmentalists
themselves, respond in kind. The current tangle of state, local, and
federal laws that dictate infrastructure permitting do not encourage
this kind of constructive engagement, pushing opponents instead toward
prolonged and costly legal battles. These laws also fail to
substantively protect the environment, guaranteeing only that a process
gets followed — not that the environment gets protected.
</p>
<p>
For decades, developers and conservationists have attacked each other
over every project and prepared to fight bitter court battles over every
detail. Developers assumed that conservation groups were out to block
them at every turn and shut down, even when members of the public asked
worthy questions. Environmentalists, meanwhile, suspected that any
developers would destroy the land if given the opportunity, whether they
were putting in oil pipelines or transmission lines, and would accept no
protest to the contrary.
</p>
<p>
SunZia’s story repeats this old, messy tradition, while also laying the
model for a new one — one in which clean energy builders and
environmental protectors work together to find the best solution for the
environment and the climate. We will need many more success stories like
it if America is to meet its climate goals — 99 more, to be exact.

id="biden-hosts-nato-chief-ahead-of-ukraine-focused-summit-of-security-alliance">Biden
hosts NATO chief ahead of Ukraine-focused summit of security
alliance</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The White House — President Joe Biden hosted NATO’s chief at the
White House on Monday, less than a month before the newly enlarged
security alliance convenes in Washington to tackle how allies will
continue to support Ukraine as it battles Russia’s invasion.</p>
<p>The aim at the July summit, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg
said, is to “ensure predictable support to Ukraine for the long
haul.”</p>
<p>But how to make that a solid and durable reality – amid the political
baggage and diverse laws and systems of governance of all 32 NATO
members – is likely to be a complex feat. Ukraine badly wants the one
thing it most certainly won’t get at this three-day convening: to
join.</p>
<p>Among the arguments against Ukraine’s NATO membership are that its
fragile and developing institutions need more time to mature, and the
fact that the nation is being currently invaded. The alliance’s most
important tenet – Article 5 – says that an armed attack against one
member is an attack on all. This has been invoked only once before, when
members rushed to the U.S.’s defense after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist
attacks.</p>
<p>Earlier Monday, VOA asked Stoltenberg how soon Ukraine would get its
wish.</p>
<p>“It is difficult, of course, to invite Ukraine when there is a war
going on,” he said. “On the other hand, it’s also hard to say that there
is no way to do that as long as there is a conflict with Russia, because
that (gives) Russia incentive to continue the conflict.</p>
<p>“So what we say is that we are going to move Ukraine closer by
helping them to meet all NATO standards to be more and more
interoperable with NATO by removing the requirements for Membership
Action Plan, and also by deepening political cooperation in the NATO
Ukraine Council, and then we will make a decision when the time is
right,” Stoltenberg added.</p>
<p>And when pressed for when that time might be, he replied: “I don’t
expect any dates. At the end of the day, this has to be negotiated among
NATO allies and we are working on that language now. So that will be
agreed when we meet in Washington in a few week’s time,” he said. “I
expect that we will find an agreement on some language which sends a
clear message about Ukraine’s membership perspectives and that Ukraine
will become a member of the alliance.”</p>
<p>Biden, in welcoming Stoltenberg, hailed the 75th anniversary and
touted what he cast as a victory: a “record number” of members, he said,
are meeting NATO’s commitment to spend at least 2% of their GDP on
defense.</p>
<p>“I think the lessons we’ve learned then, and about standing together
to defend and deter aggression, have been consequential,” he said,
seated beside Stoltenberg in the Oval Office. “And we’ve made NATO under
your leadership larger, stronger and more united than it has ever
been.”</p>
<p>Earlier Monday, Stoltenberg, the former Norwegian prime minister,
said NATO allies have given “unprecedented” support to Ukraine. He
estimates this will cost the alliance at least $45 billion per year
going forward.</p>
<p>“At the (upcoming NATO) summit, I expect other leaders to agree for
NATO to lead the coordination and provision of security assistance and
training for Ukraine,” Stoltenberg said, speaking at the Wilson Center,
a Washington think tank. “It is also why I proposed a long-term
financial pledge with fresh funding every year. The more credible our
long-term support, the quicker Moscow would realize it cannot wait us
out and the sooner this war can end. It may seem like a paradox, but the
path to peace is, therefore, more weapons for Ukraine.”</p>
<p>Analysts say these discussions set the stage for the major questions
of the upcoming summit.</p>
<p>“The main issues, still, are what does the alliance say to Ukraine
after pledges of support over the last few weeks? What is the nature of
the NATO-Ukraine relationship going forward?” said Dan Hamilton, a
nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “NATO is taking
over from the United States the military assistance and coordination of
military training for Ukraine. That’s a major step that’s happening
right now.”</p>
<p>Last week, Ukraine’s president praised a 10-year security agreement
with the U.S., saying he believes it lays a path to NATO membership.</p>
<p>“The issue of NATO is covered through the text of the agreement,”
said President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “It states that America supports
Ukraine’s future membership in NATO and recognizes that our security
agreement is a bridge to Ukraine’s membership in NATO.”</p>

id="a-year-after-the-titans-tragic-dive-deep-sea-explorers-vow-to-pursue-oceans-mysteries">A
year after the Titan’s tragic dive, deep-sea explorers vow to pursue
ocean’s mysteries</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PORTLAND, Maine — The deadly implosion of an experimental submersible
en route to the deep-sea grave of the Titanic last June has not dulled
the desire for further ocean exploration, despite lingering questions
about the disaster.</p>
<p>Tuesday marks one year since the Titan vanished on its way to the
historic wreckage site in the North Atlantic Ocean. After a five-day
search that captured attention around the world, authorities said the
vessel had been destroyed and all five people on board had died.</p>
<p>Concerns have been raised about whether the Titan was destined for
disaster because of its unconventional design and its creator’s refusal
to submit to independent checks that are standard in the industry. The
U.S. Coast Guard quickly convened a high-level investigation into what
happened, but officials said the inquiry is taking longer than the
initial 12-month time frame, and a planned public hearing to discuss
their findings won’t happen for at least another two months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, deep-sea exploration continues. The Georgia-based company
that owns the salvage rights to the Titanic plans to visit the sunken
ocean liner in July using remotely operated vehicles, and a real estate
billionaire from Ohio has said he plans a voyage to the shipwreck in a
two-person submersible in 2026.</p>
<p>The Titan dove southeast of Newfoundland. The Transportation Safety
Board of Canada said Monday that there are other submersibles operating
within Canadian waters, some of which are not registered with the
country or any other.</p>
<p>Numerous ocean explorers told The Associated Press they are confident
undersea exploration can continue safely in a post-Titan world.</p>
<p>“It’s been a desire of the scientific community to get down into the
ocean,” said Greg Stone, a veteran ocean explorer and friend of Titan
operator Stockton Rush, who died in the implosion. “I have not noticed
any difference in the desire to go into the ocean, exploring.”</p>
<p>OceanGate, a company co-founded by Rush that owned the submersible,
suspended operations in early July following the implosion. A
spokesperson for the company declined to comment.</p>
<p>David Concannon, a former adviser to OceanGate, said he will mark the
anniversary privately with a group of people who were involved with the
company or the submersible’s expeditions over the years, including
scientists, volunteers and mission specialists. Many of them, including
those who were on the Titan support ship Polar Prince, have not been
interviewed by the Coast Guard, he said.</p>
<p>“The fact is, they are isolated and in a liminal space,” he said in
an email last week. “Stockton Rush has been vilified and so has everyone
associated with OceanGate. I wasn’t even there and I have gotten death
threats. We support each other and just wait to be interviewed. The
world has moved on … but the families and those most affected are still
living with this tragedy every day.”</p>
<p>The Titan had been chronicling the Titanic’s decay and the underwater
ecosystem around the sunken ocean liner in yearly voyages since
2021.</p>
<p>The craft made its last dive on June 18, 2023, a Sunday morning, and
lost contact with its support vessel about two hours later. When it was
reported overdue that afternoon, rescuers rushed ships, planes and other
equipment to the area, about 700 kilometers south of St. John’s,
Newfoundland.</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy notified the Coast Guard that day of an anomaly in its
acoustic data that was “consistent with an implosion or explosion” at
the time communications between the Polar Prince and the Titan were
lost, a senior Navy official later told The Associated Press. The
official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive
technology.</p>
<p>Any sliver of hope that remained for finding the crew alive was wiped
away on June 22, when the Coast Guard announced that debris had been
found near the Titanic on the ocean floor. Authorities have since
recovered the submersible’s intact endcap, debris and presumed human
remains from the site.</p>
<p>In addition to Rush, the implosion killed two members of a prominent
Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood; British
adventurer Hamish Harding; and Titanic expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet.</p>
<p>Harding and Nargeolet were members of The Explorers Club, a
professional society dedicated to research, exploration and resource
conservation.</p>
<p>“Then, as now, it hit us on a personal level very deeply,” the
group’s president, Richard Garriott, said in an interview last week. “We
knew not only all the people involved, but even all the previous divers,
support teams, people working on all these vessels — those were all
either members of this club or well within our network.”</p>
<p>Garriott believes even if the Titan hadn’t imploded, the correct
rescue equipment didn’t get to the site fast enough. The tragedy caught
everyone from the Coast Guard to the ships on-site off guard,
underscoring the importance of developing detailed search and rescue
plans ahead of any expedition, he said. His organization has since
created a task force to help others do just that.</p>
<p>“That’s what we’ve been trying to really correct, to make sure that
we know exactly who to call and exactly what materials need to be
mustered,” he said.</p>

Seoul sound alarm over Putin’s visit to Pyongyang</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Washington and Seoul have expressed alarm about Russian
President Vladimir Putin’s upcoming visit to Pyongyang, while Beijing
says it has no intention of interfering with the cooperation between
Russia and North Korea.</p>
<p>Putin will pay a state visit to North Korea on Tuesday and Wednesday,
the North’s official KCNA news agency announced on Monday. His trip to
Pyongyang will be followed by a two-day state visit to Vietnam, where
discussions will touch on trade and economic cooperation, the Kremlin
said Monday.</p>
<p>The South Korean Foreign Ministry said it opposes Moscow and
Pyongyang deepening their military cooperation through Putin’s trip to
the country.</p>
<p>“All cooperation and exchanges between Russia and North Korea will
need to abide by relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions and
contribute toward the peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula,” a
spokesperson told VOA’s Korean Service on Monday.</p>
<p>Putin’s visit to the country, the first in 24 years, comes amid
increased military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang.</p>
<p>North Korea has transferred approximately 10,000 containers that
could hold nearly 5 million artillery shells to Russia to fight against
Ukraine, South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik said in an interview
with Bloomberg News on Friday.   </p>
<p>All arms exports and imports by North Korea are sanctioned by the
U.N. Security Council.</p>
<p>Both Pyongyang and Moscow have denied any arms dealings between
them.</p>
<p>Putin’s trip to Pyongyang is expected to increase military
cooperation that officially kicked off when North Korean leader Kim Jong
Un visited Russia in September 2023. Kim invited Putin to Pyongyang
during his visit to Russia.</p>
<p>“We discourage any government from receiving President Putin,” a
State Department spokesperson told VOA’s Korean Service on June 12.</p>
<p>“If he is able to travel freely, it could normalize Russia’s blatant
violations of international law and inadvertently send the message that
atrocities can be committed in Ukraine and elsewhere with impunity,” the
spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Deepening cooperation between Russia and North Korea poses concern
for the Korean Peninsula as well as for Ukraine as it defends its
“freedom and independence against Russia’s brutal war,” the spokesperson
added.</p>
<p>After the International Criminal Court in The Hague issued an arrest
warrant for Putin in March 2023 for Russia’s alleged war crimes in
Ukraine since its unprovoked invasion of the country in February 2022,
Putin is limited in his international travels to allied countries.</p>
<p>Since his new presidential term began in May, Putin has visited
Belarus, China and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy
in Washington, told VOA on Thursday that “China has no intention [of]
interfer[ing] with the exchange and cooperation between two sovereign
countries.”</p>
<p>He said, “Both DPRK and Russia are China’s friendly neighbors.” North
Korea’s official name is the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.</p>
<p>China and Russia, both veto-wielding permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council, have supported North Korea at council meetings held in
the past several years by opposing new U.S.-led resolutions condemning
North Korea’s ballistic missile launches banned by the U.N.</p>
<p>In March, Moscow vetoed a resolution granting the annual extension of
a U.N. panel of experts that monitors sanctions on North Korea while
Beijing abstained.</p>
<p>Michael Kimmage, who served on the U.S. State Department’s Policy
Planning staff on Russia and Ukraine from 2014 to 2016, said, “Putin
wishes to forge a long-term relationship with North Korea, and this
would be reflected” in his visit to Pyongyang.</p>
<p>“Not only does North Korea supply Russia with weaponry to use in its
war against Ukraine, but a more radical North Korea will pin the
resources of Russia’s archenemy, the United States, in East Asia,
helping to create a third zone of difficulty for Washington, in addition
to Europe and the Middle East,” Kimmage said.</p>
<p>Kimmage, currently the chair at Catholic University of America’s
history department, added that Russia’s other partner, China, may not
want Pyongyang to be more provocative and may not be pleased with
deepening ties between Moscow and Pyongyang.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Putin threatened to arm the West’s adversaries
with long-range missiles that could target the West in response to NATO
members, including the U.S., allowing Ukraine to use Western-supplied
weapons to target inside Russia.</p>
<p>Evans Revere, a former U.S. State Department official with extensive
experience negotiating with North Korea, said Putin’s meeting with Kim
in Pyongyang “could reveal the details of Russian support for North
Korea.”</p>
<p>“Pyongyang is reportedly interested in missile guidance, engine and
fuel technologies, avionics upgrades for its aircraft and assistance
with its nuclear program,” he said.</p>
<p>Revere added, “Russia has a significant strategic and tactical
interest in complicating the security calculus of the United States and
its allies in Northeast Asia. Putin’s visit will soon demonstrate how
far Moscow is prepared to go in pursuing that interest.”</p>
<p>VOA’s Soyoung Ahn contributed to this report.</p>
