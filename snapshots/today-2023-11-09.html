The <i>New York Times</i> team of Tripp Mickle, Cade Metz and Yiwen Lu
have been covering San Francisco’s experiment with robotaxis from
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/21/technology/waymo-driverless-cars-san-francisco.html">Waymo</a>
and
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/28/technology/driverless-cars-san-francisco.html">Cruise</a>
for some time. Their latest report is
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html"><i>G.M.’s
Cruise Moved Fast in the Driverless Race. It Got Ugly.</i></a>, and it
is a doozy. Leaving aside the serious safety issues that finally forced
the DMV to
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/24/technology/cruise-driverless-san-francisco-suspended.html">stop
Cruise operating</a>, their history of interference with
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/18/cruise-self-driving-car-in-san-francisco-fire-truck-crash-one-injured.html">first
responders</a>, and the
<a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/video-cruise-cars-halt-traffic-in-sf-cite-connectivity-issues-linked-to-outside-lands-festival/">traffic
congestion</a> they exacerbate, the really devastating part of the
article is the economics. Below the fold, I lay out the numbers.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> The reason robotaxis look like a
good investment is that the up-front investment in equipping cars with
high-tech sensors and powerful computers would earn returns in two ways,
by removing the need to pay drivers, and by operating 24/7. In the real
world, it isn’t quite that simple.<br /> <br /> First, the investment is
very significant. The NYT team reports on
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/21/technology/waymo-driverless-cars-san-francisco.html">Waymo</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/24/technology/self-driving-cars-wait.html">cars
are staggeringly expensive</a>, outfitted with high-tech sensors and
cameras, and are worth as much as $200,000.
</blockquote>
And on
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html">Cruise</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Each Chevrolet Bolt that Cruise operates costs $150,000 to $200,000,
according to a person familiar with its operations.
</blockquote>
So the upfront investment is around $150K/car. Assuming a 5-year life
and 7% interest, the annual cost would be around $32K, or about $90/day.
After paying about $12/hr for fuel, insurance, repairs, depreciation and
so on an
<a href="https://therideshareguy.com/how-much-do-uber-drivers-make/">Uber
driver makes $18/hr</a>, or assuming an 8hr day, $144/day. The robotaxi
looks like it is about $54/day ahead.<br /> <br /> Proponents will claim
that the robotaxi works 24hrs/day, not just 8. But the demand for rides
isn’t constant through the day. The robotaxi fleet needs enough cars to
satisfy peak demand, so most will be idle for most of the time, still
consuming interest and depreciation. Uber doesn’t pay for the cars, and
Uber drivers only work when there is enough demand for rides. I think
this is roughly a wash, so the robotaxi stays about $54/day ahead.<br />
<br /> So far I have assumed that the robotaxi fleet needs no humans.
But, as the NYT team reports, that
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html">isn’t
the case</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Half of Cruise’s 400 cars were in San Francisco when the driverless
operations were stopped. Those vehicles were supported by a vast
operations staff, with 1.5 workers per vehicle.
</blockquote>
With 1.5 workers at Uber’s pay rate the robotaxi’s staff and equipment
is costing $306/day, so the robotaxi is $162/day behind, and Cruise is
unlikely to be able to pay only $18/hr. What were the 1.5 people per car
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html">actually
doing</a>?<br />
<blockquote>
The workers intervened to assist the company’s vehicles every 2.5 to
five miles, according to two people familiar with is operations.
</blockquote>
Lora Kolodny followed up the NYT team’s reporting in
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/06/cruise-confirms-robotaxis-rely-on-human-assistance-every-4-to-5-miles.html"><i>Cruise
confirms robotaxis rely on human assistance every four to five
miles</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Vogt confirmed that the General Motors-owned company does have a remote
assistance team, in response to a discussion under the header, “GM’s
Cruise alleged to rely on human operators to achieve ‘autonomous’
driving.”<br /> <br /> The CEO wrote, “Cruise AVs are being remotely
assisted (RA) 2-4% of the time on average, in complex urban
environments. This is low enough already that there isn’t a huge cost
benefit to optimizing much further, especially given how useful it is to
have humans review things in certain situations.”
</blockquote>
Clearly, the robotaxi fleet needs some staff. The cars need refueling,
say every 200 miles. They need cleaning. Lets guess the average ride is
5 miles and they need cleaning every 10 rides. That would be staff
required every 40 miles. So the vast majority of interventions are
because Cruise’s self-driving technology just can’t handle San Francisco
traffic. They may be called robotaxis, just pay no attention to the
driver behind the curtain. These remote drivers will be <i>more
expensive</i> than the in-car drivers they are replacing!<br /> <br />
Overall, their robotaxi operation is costing GM a
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html">boatload
of money</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
G.M. has spent an average of $588 million a quarter on Cruise over the
past year, a 42 percent increase from a year ago.
</blockquote>
$2,232B/year for 400 cars is $5.6M per car per year! How could each car
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html">earn
this much</a>?<br />
<blockquote>
The company charged an average of $10.50 per ride in the city.
</blockquote>
To generate $5.6M each car would have to service 510K rides/year or
1,400 rides/day, or one ride per minute. Cruise’s goal, before they got
shut down,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html">was
less ambitious</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The shutdown complicates Cruise’s ambition of hitting its goal of $1
billion of revenue in 2025.
</blockquote>
Covering less than half their costs in 2025 is about 91M rides, or about
250K/day. Lets be generous, and assume 10 rides/day/car. They would need
25K Chevrolet Bolts. Scaling the operation from 400 to 25K in under 2
years would be hard. It would be made harder because
<a href="https://gmauthority.com/blog/2023/11/gm-confirms-2023-chevy-bolt-ev-bolt-euv-production-will-end-in-december/">Bolt
production stops next month</a>. But even if the Bolts were available,
this would be an additional investment of between $3.7B and $5B in order
to lose only $1.2B/year.<br /> <br /> I’m not the only one pointing out
that the numbers don’t add up. Here, for example, is
<a href="https://www.eschatonblog.com/2023/11/imagine-theres-no-people.html">Atrios</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Focusing on the notoriously high margin taxi business has always been
odd, in that even if they “work” it’s not entirely clear where the big
profit opportunity is! Replacing low wage workers with expensive
machines that require a lot of attention from people who have more
specialized skills than “driving” doesn’t seem to be such a great
plan!<br /> <br /> I get the appeal for the carbrained. What “we” all
want is a 24 hour driver at an affordable rate. It’s just not quite
clear what the business model is, even if the technology works!<br />
<br /> People always point to niche cases in which robot car would be
particularly useful. But they’re niche cases and you need scale to make
anything in this industry profitable! Scale is necessary for a lot of
reasons, but one is maintenance and spare parts production. Your
self-driving campus vans won’t last long if there’s only one guy who
knows to maintain them and the parts manufacturer just went bankrupt.
</blockquote>
Last August, Hubert Horan continued his long-running series with
<a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2023/08/hubert-horan-can-uber-ever-deliver-part-thirty-three-uber-isnt-really-profitable-yet-but-is-getting-closer-the-antitrust-case-against-uber.html"><i>Part
Thirty-Three: Uber Isn’t Really Profitable Yet But is Getting Closer;
The Antitrust Case Against Uber</i></a>, which starts:<br />
<blockquote>
<b>After $33 Billion in Losses Over 14 Years, Uber is Finally
Approaching GAAP Breakeven</b><br /> <br /> Uber claimed its first ever
quarterly GAAP profit when it released its second quarter and first half
financial results on August 1. The claim was a bit of stretch as the
reported $394 million second quarter profit ($237 million for the first
half) was entirely explained by an alleged $386 million second quarter
gain ($707 million in the first half) in the value of untradable
securities they hold in companies like Didi, Grab, and Aurora that have
nothing to do with their ongoing operations. Readers of this series will
know that Uber has aggressively used claims like this to justify
misleading claims about its corporate financial performance ever since
2018 when it inflated published net income numbers by $5.8 billion just
prior to its IPO.
</blockquote>
Uber has always viewed drivers as a temporary necessity to tide them
over until robotaxis take over and boost them into actual instead of
manipulated profits. Last month they started offering
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/26/uber-begins-offering-rides-in-self-driving-waymo-cars.html">robotaxi
service in Phoenix</a> using Waymo’s cars. But unless Waymo is showing
them radically different numbers than the NYT team found for Cruise,
Horan’s series is going to run and run.<br /> <br /> These numbers look
even worse for Tesla. Last year Matthew Loh reported that
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-worth-basically-zero-without-self-driving-2022-6"><i>Elon
Musk says the difference between Tesla being ‘worth a lot of money or
worth basically zero’ all comes down to solving self-driving
technology</i></a>, and the reason was that owners would rent out their
Teslas as robotaxis when they weren’t using them. This was always
obviously a stupid idea; who wants drunkards home-bound from the pub
throwing up on their Tesla’s seats? But the fact that the numbers don’t
add up for robotaxis in general, and the fact that
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/27/23934691/hertz-tesla-uber-ev-plans-damage-repair-price-cuts"><i>Hertz
is scaling back its EV ambitions because its Teslas keep getting
damaged</i></a> because half of them are being used by Uber drivers as
taxis, make the idea even more laughable.<br /> <br /> It is really
surprising that the DMV took so long to shut Cruise down. In August
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/21/technology/waymo-driverless-cars-san-francisco.html">the
NYT team wrote</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Last week, a Cruise driverless car collided with a fire truck responding
to an emergency.
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/17/us/driverless-car-accident-sf.html">Another
Cruise vehicle</a> got stuck in wet concrete. The week before,
<a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/video-cruise-cars-halt-traffic-in-sf-cite-connectivity-issues-linked-to-outside-lands-festival/">several

More recently,
<a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/11/06/cruise-self-driving-cars-children/">Sam
Biddle reported that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
previously unreported internal materials such as chat logs show Cruise
has known internally about two pressing safety issues: Driverless Cruise
cars struggled to detect large holes in the road and have so much
trouble recognizing children in certain scenarios that they risked
hitting them. Yet, until it came under fire this month, Cruise kept its
fleet of driverless taxis active, maintaining its
<a href="https://getcruise.com/news/blog/2023/human-ridehail-crash-rate-benchmark/">regular
reassurances of superhuman safety</a>.
</blockquote>
In contrast, all the NYT team could find to report
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/21/technology/waymo-driverless-cars-san-francisco.html">about
Waymo was</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In May, one of its
<a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/file/waymo_052123-pdf/">cars
struck and killed a small dog</a>. A few years ago,
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/waymo-says-self-driving-car-that-struck-pedestrian-in-san-francisco-was-in-manual-mode/">a
driverless Waymo car with a human safety driver operating the wheel</a>
hit a pedestrian who needed to be taken to the hospital. The company has
been collecting fares in the Phoenix area for several years and now has
a fleet navigating some 200 miles across that region, including to and
from the airport.
</blockquote>
Why is Cruise so much less safe? The NYT team
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html">write</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Company insiders are putting the blame for what went wrong on a tech
industry culture — led by the 38-year-old Mr. Vogt — that put a priority
on the speed of the program over safety. In the competition between
Cruise and its top driverless car rival, Waymo, Mr. Vogt wanted to
dominate in the same way Uber dominated its smaller ride-hailing
competitor, Lyft.<br /> <br /> “Kyle is a guy who is willing to take
risks, and he is willing to move quickly. He is very Silicon Valley,”
said Matthew Wansley, a professor at the Cardozo School of Law in New
York who specializes in emerging automotive technologies. “That both
explains the success of Cruise and its mistakes.”
</blockquote>
As someone who has been sharing the roads with Waymo cars for many
years, I have always believed that Waymo, unlike Cruise and much worse
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/10/elon-musk-threat-or-menace-part-3.html">Tesla</a>,
understood that it was necessary to <i>prove</i> that self-driving
technology was safe, not just gaslight the public as
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html">Mr. Vogt
did</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
To make streets safer, he said in an interview, cities should embrace
self-driving cars like those designed by Cruise, a subsidiary of General
Motors. They do not get distracted, drowsy or drunk, he said, and being
programmed to put safety first meant they could substantially reduce
car-related fatalities.
</blockquote>
Two months later Cruise’s safety record got them shut down.
<a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/11/06/cruise-self-driving-cars-children/">The
very same day</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
CEO Mary Barra told financial analysts that Cruise “is safer than a
human driver and is constantly improving and getting better.”

exec defends 8GB $1,599 MacBook Pro, claims it’s like 16GB on a PC</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Eight gigabytes has been the standard RAM load out on new MacBook
Pros for the better part of a decade, and in 2023, Apple execs still
believe it’s enough for customers. With the launch of Apple’s M3 MacBook
Pros last month, a base 14-inch $1,599 model with an M3 chip still only
gets you 8GB of unified DRAM that’s shared between the CPU, GPU, and
neural network accelerator. In a show of Apple’s typical modesty this
week, the tech giant’s veep of worldwide product marketing Bob Borchers
has argued, in an interview with machine-learning engineer Lin YilYi,
that the Arm-compatible, Apple-designed M-series silicon and software
stack is so memory efficient that 8GB on a Mac may equal 16GB on a PC –
so we therefore ought to be happy with it. Eight gigabyte of RAM in and
of itself isn’t an issue, on a budget machine. Apple is selling
incredibly expensive machines labelled as “pro” with a mere 8 GB, and
charges €200 for another 8, which is highway robbery, plain and simple.
I wonder how many people at Apple – at any level – use Macs with 8 GB of
RAM. I have a feeling that number is quite low.</p>

begin adding Swift to the Godot editor (not via bindings).

<p>
The only issue is that it currently contains a lot of unnecessary junk
from “thirdpartylibraries” and also requires some manual header file
changes, I’ll write a script to automate that.

From the BBC World Service: A group of young former McDonald’s workers
in the United Kingdom is taking the fast food chain to court, accusing
it of failing to protect them at work. Earlier this year, a BBC
investigation revealed allegations of sexual assault, harassment, racism
and bullying. Plus, Bangladesh is the world’s second-largest exporter of
clothes, but workers are protesting over better pay and conditions.
Then, as the French government hosts a conference in Paris today to
discuss ways of getting humanitarian aid to people in Gaza, we hear from
a bakery in the territory that is struggling to keep up with the massive
demand for crucial supplies of bread.

But there is no doubt some online sellers deliberately trick customers
into buying smaller and often cheaper-to-produce items, Witcher said.
Common tactics include displaying products against a white background
rather than in room sets or on models, or photographing items with a
perspective that makes them appear bigger than they really are.
Dimensions can be hidden deep in the product description, or not
included at all…

<p>Xiaomi also has bad news for MIUI users who wish to unlock their
smartphones, saying they won’t get updated to HyperOS. “Previous
operating systems, such as MIUI 14, still retain the ability to unlock,
but users will no longer receive any Xiaomi HyperOS updates if they
leave their devices in an unlocked state,” the company told us. The
Chinese brand clarified in a follow-up email that HyperOS updates won’t
be available if you’ve unlocked your phone’s bootloader, regardless of
whether you’re on MIUI 14 or HyperOS. However, the company said you’ll
receive HyperOS updates if you choose to lock your device again. This
applies to all Xiaomi devices outside of China. I rarely say this, but
with this new “HyperOS” skin being the most blatant iOS ripoff I’ve ever
seen, just get an iPhone if you want that experience that badly.</p>

<h2 id="sanitize-html-and-svg">Sanitize HTML and SVG?</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Sanitize HTML and SVG?
</h1>
<p>
Would you do it? Is “writing your own website” an activity that could be
described as “untrusted user generated content”? I get the feeling that
perhaps it is not! It is your site, you are writing the thing, so it’s
trusted. Your visitors need to trust you, too.
</p>
<p>
Now, in order for an attacker to hurt your visitors, they would need to
get access to the file system via the web server somehow.
</p>
<p>
Do you feel that the situation changes when there’s a service like
<a href="oddmu">Oddmu</a> that generates the HTML based on Markdown?
</p>
<p>
I guess the source remains the same, you’re writing the Markdown,
therefore the HTML, and so on. But now the attack surface is larger:
attackers can attack either the web server (the reverse proxy in front)
or the service itself (in the backend). I don’t run the service in a
“demilitarized zone” (DMZ) – what a word! – so there’s that.
</p>
<p>
The reason I’m wondering about all that is because I wonder whether I
need to sanitize the output of the Markdown to HTML conversion using a
library like
<a href="https://github.com/microcosm-cc/bluemonday">bluemonday</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
bluemonday takes untrusted user generated content as an input, and will
return HTML that has been sanitised against an allowlist of approved
HTML elements and attributes so that you can safely include the content
in your web page.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hm. Even if Oddmu is used by a group of people, I would still assume
that they trust each other. In such a context, there are no “untrusted
users”.
</p>
<p>
So why not take the easy route and just apply sanitization always? The
reason is that I sometimes (rarely!) include SVG in my Markdown, like in
<a href="2022-06-30_How_to_communicate_dungeon_maps_to_players">2022-06-30
How to communicate dungeon maps to players</a>.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday evening and this morning I spent a fair amount of time writing
code that adds SVG validation to a bluemonday policy. You can take a
look in
<a href="https://github.com/microcosm-cc/bluemonday/issues/196">issue
#196</a>. It’s awful. And I suspect that the specs will keep changing
over time and so I will keep running into issues. It would be much
easier to just drop it.

in Attack on Nancy Pelosi’s Husband Goes on Trial in San Francisco</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The man accused of breaking into former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s
San Francisco home, bludgeoning her husband with a hammer and seeking to
kidnap her goes on trial Thursday.</p>
<p>Opening statements are scheduled in the federal trial of David
DePape, who prosecutors say assaulted then-82-year-old Paul Pelosi,
sending shockwaves through the political world just days before last
year’s midterm elections.</p>
<p>The attack in the early hours of Oct. 28, 2022, also highlighted how
conspiracy theories and misinformation that spread online can fuel
political violence.</p>
<p>DePape pleaded not guilty to attempted kidnapping of a federal
official and assault on the immediate family member of a federal
official. Paul Pelosi is expected to testify next week.</p>
<p>DePape posted rants on a blog and an online forum about aliens,
communists, religious minorities and global elites. He questioned the
results of the 2020 election and echoed the baseless, right-wing QAnon
conspiracy theory that claims the U.S. government is run by a cabal of
devil-worshipping pedophiles.</p>
<p>The websites were taken down shortly after his arrest.</p>
<p>A Canadian citizen, DePape moved to the United States more than 20
years ago after falling in love with Gypsy Taub, a Berkeley pro-nudity
activist well-known in the Bay Area, his stepfather, Gene DePape said.
In recent years, David DePape had been homeless and struggling with drug
abuse and mental illness, Taub told local media.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors say DePape smashed his shoulder through a glass
panel on a door in the back of the Pelosis’ Pacific Heights mansion and
confronted a sleeping Paul Pelosi, who was wearing boxer shorts and a
pajama top.</p>
<p>“Where’s Nancy? Where’s Nancy?” DePape asked, standing over Paul
Pelosi around 2 a.m. holding a hammer and zip ties, according to court
records. Nancy Pelosi was in Washington and under the protection of her
security detail, which does not extend to family members.</p>
<p>Paul Pelosi called 911 and two San Francisco Police officers showed
up and witnessed DePape strike Paul Pelosi in the head with a hammer,
knocking him unconscious, court records showed.</p>
<p>Nancy Pelosi’s husband of 60 years later underwent surgery to repair
a skull fracture and injuries to his right arm and hands.</p>
<p>After his arrest, DePape, 43, allegedly told a San Francisco
detective that he wanted to hold Nancy Pelosi hostage. He said that if
she told him the truth, he would let her go and if she lied, he was
going to “break her kneecaps” to show other members of Congress there
were “consequences to actions,” according to prosecutors.</p>
<p>A backpack DePape was carrying had tape and a rope, in addition to
zip ties, according to police.</p>
<p>The assault was captured on the officers’ body cameras. U.S. District
Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley ruled last month that the jury will be
allowed to see footage that shows Paul Pelosi in a pool of his own blood
struggling to breathe and the police officers trying to stop the
bleeding. Angela Chuang, one of DePape’s federal public defenders, had
argued that the shocking footage would be prejudicial to her client.</p>
<p>Corley also ruled jurors can listen to portions of a 5-minute call
DePape made in January to a television reporter in which he repeated
conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>“Freedom and liberty isn’t dying, it’s being killed systematically
and deliberately,” he said.</p>
<p>“The tree of liberty needs watering. He needs men of valor, patriots
willing to put their own lives on the line to stand in opposition to
tyranny,” he added.</p>
<p>Katherine Keneally, a senior researcher at the nonprofit Institute
for Strategic Dialogue, said the attack is an example of increasing
online hate, conspiracies and false narratives influencing political
violence.</p>
<p>“This didn’t occur in a vacuum,” Keneally said.</p>
<p>Keneally said people who commit such conspiracy-fueled acts of
violence often are struggling with mental health or other life crises,
such as the death of a family member or a divorce.</p>
<p>“I can’t think of a single case where someone engaged in violent
behavior where they were solely influenced by the conspiracy theory,”
she said.</p>
<p>DePape, who lived in a garage in the Bay Area city of Richmond and
had been doing odd carpentry jobs to support himself, allegedly told
authorities he had other targets, including a women’s and queer studies
professor, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, actor Tom Hanks and President
Joe Biden’s son Hunter.</p>
<p>One of those targets is included in the defense’s short witness list,
though their name has been redacted. The other possible witnesses are
DePape, Nancy Pelosi’s chief of staff Daniel Bernal, extremism and
antisemitism researcher Elizabeth Yates, and federal public defender
Catherine Goulet.</p>
<p>The prosecution’s list of potential witnesses contains 15 names,
including the surgeon who operated on Paul Pelosi, federal agents, San
Francisco police officers and several first responders.</p>
<p>If convicted, DePape faces life in prison. He was also charged in
state court with attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, elder
abuse, residential burglary and other felonies. He pleaded not guilty to
those charges. A state trial has not been scheduled.</p>

<h2 id="picassos-woman-with-a-watch-fetches-139m-at-auction">Picasso’s
‘Woman with a Watch’ Fetches $139M at Auction</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>One of Pablo Picasso’s masterpieces, Woman with a Watch, was sold at
auction Wednesday night for $139.3 million by Sotheby’s in New York, the
second-highest price ever achieved for the artist.</p>
<p>In a jam-packed room at the venerable auction house, it only took a
few minutes of telephone bidding for the 1932 painting depicting one of
the Spanish artist’s companions and muses, the French painter
Marie-Therese Walter, to be sold.</p>
<p>Femme a la montre had been valued at over $120 million before going
on the block, according to Sotheby’s.</p>
<p>It was part of the house’s special sale this week of the collection
of New York arts patron Emily Fisher Landau, who died this year at age
102.</p>
<p>Julian Dawes, Sotheby’s head of impressionist and modern art, called
the Picasso canvas – which hung in Landau’s living room – “a masterpiece
by every measure.”</p>
<p>“Painted in 1932 – Picasso’s ‘annus mirabilis’ – it is full of
joyful, passionate abandon yet at the same time it is utterly considered
and resolved,” he said.</p>
<p>Walter was regarded as Picasso’s “golden muse,” and features in
another of his works going under the hammer on Thursday at Christie’s:
Femme endormie, or Sleeping Woman, estimated to sell for $25 million-$35
million.</p>
<p>She also featured in Femme assise pres d’une fenetre (Marie-Therese),
or Woman Sitting Near a Window, which was sold in 2021 for $103.4
million.</p>
<p>Walter met Picasso in Paris in 1927, when she was just 17 and the
Spanish artist was still married to Russian-Ukrainian ballet dancer Olga
Khokhlova. The couple had a daughter, who died last year.</p>
<p>Another Picasso from 1932 was sold for $106 million in 2010.</p>
<p>The record sale for one of his works was of The Women of Algiers
(Version O), a 1955 oil painting which sold for $179.4 million.</p>
<p>When it went under the hammer at Christie’s New York in 2015, it was
also the record for any work of art sold at auction.</p>
<p>It was dethroned in November 2017 by the sale of Salvator Mundi
attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, which went for $450 million and holds
the record to this day.</p>
<p>Hot market</p>
<p>Fifty years after his death in 1973 at age 91, Picasso remains one of
the most influential artists of the modern world, often hailed as a
dynamic and creative genius.</p>
<p>But following the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and
assault, his reputation has been tarnished by accusations he exerted a
violent hold over the women who shared his life and inspired his
art.</p>
<p>Sotheby’s has already netted $406 million in sales from Landau’s
collection, which also includes works by Jasper Johns, Willem de
Kooning, Mark Rothko and Andy Warhol.</p>
<p>Flags by the 93-year-old Johns sold for $41 million, while Securing
the Last Letter (Boss) by painter and photographer Ed Ruscha sold for
$39.4 million.</p>
<p>Auction houses are enjoying a healthy art and luxury goods market,
driven by China and showing no signs of a slowdown, said Kelsey Reed
Leonard, head of contemporary art sales at Sotheby’s.</p>
<p>Against a backdrop of wars in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as worldwide
inflation, the two titans of the sector – Sotheby’s and Christie’s –
will be moving a host of big-ticket lots in the autumn sales, though
they may still have a hard time topping last year, when total sales hit
a record $16 billion.</p>

id="judge-to-hear-arguments-as-michigan-activists-try-to-keep-trump-off-ballot">Judge
to Hear Arguments as Michigan Activists Try to Keep Trump Off
Ballot</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A judge in Michigan is expected to hear arguments Thursday on whether
Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson has the authority to keep Donald
Trump’s name off state ballots for president.</p>
<p>Activists are suing Benson in the Michigan Court of Claims to force
her to keep Trump’s name off ballots and to assess Trump’s
constitutional qualifications to serve a second term as president.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, attorneys for the former president are demanding that
Trump’s name be allowed on the 2024 Republican presidential primary
ballot.</p>
<p>Arguments were scheduled to begin Thursday morning in Grand Rapids
before Judge James Robert Redford.</p>
<p>Activists — in two separate suits — point to a section of the U.S.
Constitution’s 14th Amendment that prohibits a person from running for
federal office if they have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against
the U.S. or given aid or comfort to those who have.</p>
<p>Liberal groups also have filed lawsuits in Colorado and Minnesota to
bar Trump from the ballot, portraying him as the inciter of the January
6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, which was intended to stop Congress
from certifying Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential election win.</p>
<p>The groups cite a rarely used constitutional prohibition against
holding office for those who swore an oath to uphold the Constitution
but then “engaged in insurrection” against it. The two-sentence clause
in the 14th Amendment has been used only a handful of times since the
years after the Civil War.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit citing
the provision. The court’s ruling said its decision applied only to the
state’s primary.</p>
<p>Free Speech For People, a group representing petitioners before the
Minnesota Supreme Court, also represents petitioners in one of the
Michigan cases against Benson.</p>
<p>Trump is considered the leading candidate for the 2024 Republican
presidential nomination.</p>
<p>Benson already has said in a filing that Michigan’s Legislature does
not give her the authority to determine whether a candidate for
president may be disqualified for the state ballot under the 14th
Amendment or to assess a candidate’s constitutional qualifications to
serve as president.</p>
<p>It’s a “federal constitutional question of enormous consequence”
whether Trump cannot appear as a presidential candidate on state
ballots, Benson wrote. “Michigan courts have held that administrative
agencies generally do not have the power to determine constitutional
questions.”</p>
<p>However, she added that she will follow the direction of the court
either way.</p>

Presidential Candidates Back Israel at Latest Debate</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Five Republicans hoping to be their party’s candidate in next year’s
U.S. presidential election debated Wednesday night, expressing support
for Israel in its war against Hamas, while clashing over China and
Russia.</p>
<p>Not appearing on the debate stage in Miami was Republican
front-runner Donald Trump, who is seeking to return to the White House
after losing the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Trump has not appeared at any of the three Republican debates, and
while holding his own rally nearby on Wednesday called the event with
his competitors “unwatchable.”</p>
<p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who appears a distant second place in
opinion polls, said Trump owes it to those watching the debates to
appear and “explain why he should get another chance” to be the party’s
nominee.</p>
<p>Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie pointed to Trump’s multiple
current and impending legal trials, saying, “Anybody who’s going to be
spending the next year and a half of their life focusing on keeping
themselves out of jail and courtrooms cannot lead this party.”</p>
<p>With Israel’s military response to an October attack by Hamas
militants in its second month, former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki
Haley said Israel needs to “eliminate Hamas.”</p>
<p>“We need to be very clear-eyed to know there would be no Hamas
without Iran, there would be no Hezbollah without Iran, there would not
be the Houthis without Iran, and there wouldn’t be the Iranian militias
in Syria and Iraq that are trying to hit our military men and women, if
it hadn’t been for Iran,” Haley said.</p>
<p>Senator Tim Scott said he would tell Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, “not only do you have the responsibility and the right to
wipe Hamas off the map, we will support you.”</p>
<p>Republican candidates will next debate on Dec. 6.</p>
<p>Voters will begin selecting the party’s presidential nominee Jan. 15
with the Iowa caucuses, and after the state-by-state nominating contests
conclude, the Republican nominee will officially be named at the party’s
convention in July.</p>

id="takeaways-from-the-third-2024-republican-presidential-debate">Takeaways
From the Third 2024 Republican Presidential Debate</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Five candidates seeking to halt Donald Trump’s march toward the 2024
Republican presidential nomination gathered in Miami on Wednesday for
the party’s third debate while the former president held a separate
campaign rally across town.</p>
<p>Here are some takeaways from the debate:</p>
<p>Laying blame</p>
<p>One night after a stinging series of election losses at the hands of
Democrats, the candidates vented their frustrations on the debate
stage.</p>
<p>“I’m sick of Republicans losing,” Florida Governor Ron DeSantis
said.</p>
<p>DeSantis has long contrasted his successful reelection last year in
Florida with Republican setbacks in the last few elections, including
Trump’s loss in 2020. Earlier in the day, his campaign argued that
backing Trump cost candidates seats in races such as the one for
governor of Kentucky, where Republican Daniel Cameron lost to Democrat
Andy Beshear.</p>
<p>Republicans on Wednesday were also smarting from the success of a
ballot issue in Ohio that enshrined the right to an abortion in the
state constitution, as well as the loss of state legislative control in
Virginia.</p>
<p>Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy blamed Ronna McDaniel, the chair of the
Republican National Committee, instead of Trump, for the party’s recent
performance.</p>
<p>“We’ve become a party of losers,” he lamented. “We have to have
accountability in our party.”</p>
<p>McDaniel was Trump’s hand-picked choice to lead the RNC in 2017, and
the committee was a sponsor of Wednesday’s debate.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy comes out swinging</p>
<p>It was clear from the outset that Ramaswamy, whose candidacy has
faded since the first debate, was determined to be a spoiler and throw
elbows in every direction.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy, a businessman with no political experience, attacked
former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and DeSantis right out of the
gate.</p>
<p>In an exchange regarding the conflict in Israel, Ramaswamy warned
that the two leading candidates on the stage could drag America into a
bloody war in Europe, while also channeling speculation that DeSantis
wears lifts inside his boots.</p>
<p>“Do you want Dick Cheney in 3-inch heels? Because you’ve got two of
them on stage tonight,” he said in reference to Haley and DeSantis,
while invoking the Republican former vice president who was known for
his neoconservative views.</p>
<p>“They’re 5-inch heels, and I don’t wear them unless I can run in
them,” Haley later shot back. “They are not a fashion statement, they
are ammunition.”</p>
<p>Ramaswamy wasn’t finished going after Haley. During a discussion over
banning the Chinese short video app TikTok, he mentioned that Haley’s
daughter used the platform. “You might want to take care of your family
first,” he said.</p>
<p>“Leave my daughter out of your voice,” Haley countered, adding under
her breath, “You’re just scum.”</p>
<p>Given his lagging poll numbers, the Miami debate could end up being
Ramaswamy’s final one. Haley won’t miss him.</p>
<p>Haley and DeSantis go head-to-head on China</p>
<p>All eyes were on Haley and DeSantis, who were widely expected to go
after each other in a bid to establish themselves as the top challenger
to Trump in the Republican nominating contest.</p>
<p>After circling each other for half the debate, they finally went on
the attack over the other’s dealings with China.</p>
<p>Both said their opponent had cozied up to Chinese industry as
governors — Haley in South Carolina and DeSantis in Florida. Both,
unsurprisingly, disagreed, leading to a heated exchange.</p>
<p>While all candidates on the stage portray themselves as tough on
China, Haley has taken pains for months to establish herself as the top
China hawk in the field.</p>
<p>The DeSantis campaign, meanwhile, has tried to attack Haley on that
issue, accusing her of welcoming a Chinese company into her state.</p>

id="biden-administration-picks-maryland-for-new-fbi-headquarters">Biden
Administration Picks Maryland for New FBI Headquarters</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Biden administration has chosen a Maryland location for a new FBI
headquarters, the General Services Administration confirmed Wednesday,
as the suburban Washington location was selected over nearby Virginia
following a sharp competition between the two states.</p>
<p>The site is planned for Greenbelt, about 20 kilometers northeast of
Washington.</p>
<p>“GSA looks forward to building the FBI a state-of-the-art
headquarters campus in Greenbelt to advance their critical mission for
years to come,” Robin Carnahan, the GSA administrator, said. “Thank you
to everyone at GSA, DOJ, FBI, Congress, and others who helped reach this
important milestone after a comprehensive, multi-year effort.”</p>
<p>The GSA also noted that Greenbelt was determined to be the best site
because it came at the lowest cost to taxpayers, provided the greatest
transportation access to FBI employees and visitors, and gave the
government the most certainty on a project delivery schedule.</p>
<p>Consideration for a new headquarters has been going on for more than
a decade, and in recent months the FBI has expressed concern about the
site selection process.</p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland said the location in his state
was ideal because of access to mass transit and because the cost to
taxpayers would be significantly less there.</p>
<p>“We’re very happy about this location. We’ve got a lot more work to
do,” Cardin said. The choice was first reported by The Washington
Post.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, Maryland’s elected leaders applauded the
decision and said their push to bring the FBI headquarters there was
“never about politics” and the new facility would meet a “dire,
longstanding need for a new consolidated headquarters.”</p>
<p>Democratic Maryland Gov. Wes Moore argued in recent months that
building it there would be fast, save taxpayers $1 billion and meet
equity goals raised by President Joe Biden, with a location in the
majority-Black Prince George’s County.</p>
<p>Most of Maryland’s congressional delegation and the governor
personally raised concerns to the GSA in March about the process,
including extra weight abruptly given in 2022 to proximity to the FBI
Academy in Quantico, Virginia.</p>
<p>News of the choice brought frustrated criticism from Virginia
leaders.</p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia told reporters he had not
been officially notified of the selection, but if true, “it would be
evidence of gross political interference in an established GSA process
that both states went through, and it would be frankly more reminiscent
of the tactics from the last administration.”</p>
<p>In a joint statement with Sen. Tim Kaine, he said he was disappointed
that the “clear case” for Virginia, home to the FBI Academy, was set
aside.</p>
<p>Virginia leaders, including Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, argued
that along with the academy the state has also welcomed Amazon and other
big companies in recent years.</p>
<p>In July, the GSA announced changes in criteria for choosing the new
location, boosting two potential places in Maryland. The new criteria

Tonight, at approximately seven feet above sea level, the five leading
Republican presidential candidates not named Trump assembled in a
performing arts center in Miami to once again go through the motions of
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/24/politics/gop-debate-trump-surrender-analysis/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pretending
this is a normal election cycle</a>.
</p>
<p style>
If you happened to be doing something else with your finite mortal hours
on Wednesday evening, though, you didn’t miss much. Entrepreneur Vivek
Ramaswamy made every effort to maintain his status as the group’s enfant
terrible with obnoxious barbs that didn’t even spare the moderators;
Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina managed to use a Bible verse to talk
about the economy; and former Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey
reminded the American people that, yes, he is still here.
</p>
<p style>
The debate finally gained a bit of a pulse, however, during a brief
rematch between Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida and former U.N.
Ambassador Nikki Haley over DeSantis’ fracking record. During the
previous debate in September (yes, Wednesday’s was the <em>third
</em>Republican debate so far), Haley had blasted DeSantis for being
“against fracking” and “against drilling.” DeSantis protested — although
a fact check showed
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/ron-desantis-fracking-florida-debate-nikki-haley" target="_self">Haley
kind of had a point</a>, seeing as the governor signed an executive
order telling his state officials to “take necessary actions to
adamantly oppose” fracking and offshore drilling on his second day in
office.
</p>
<p style>
On Wednesday, Haley started in again. “It cracks me up that Ron
continues to do this: He has opposed fracking, he’s opposed drilling,”
she said. Then she went for the jugular: “He was praised by the Sierra
Club,” she slammed. “You’re trying to make up for it and act like you
weren’t a liberal when it comes to the environment — but you are, you
always have been. Just own it if that’s the case, but don’t keep saying
you’re something that you’re not.”

DeSantis protested the use of the E-word (not to mention the L-word) was
unfair. “We are <em>absolutely</em> going to frack,” he insisted, though
you could see a flicker of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/ron-desantis-environment-climate-change" target="_blank">his
old green moderateness</a> when he added, “I don’t think it’s a good
idea to drill in the Florida Everglades and I know most Floridians agree
with me.” The end of his sentence was drowned out, however, by Haley
saying loudly into her mic, “<em>YOU BANNED FRACKING</em>.”
</p>
<p style>
As was the case the last time around, Haley and DeSantis’ back-and-forth
just goes to show “the [Republican] Party’s utter confusion about how to
handle environmental issues,” as <em>Heatmap</em>’s Robinson Meyer
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/ron-desantis-fracking-florida-debate-nikki-haley" target="_self">has
written</a>. On the one hand, the conversation around environmental
protections and the green transition has advanced to the point that even
the GOP debates
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/even-a-republican-debate-has-to-cover-climate-change-in-2023" target="_self">can’t
ignore climate change</a> (or,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/second-gop-debate-climate-energy" target="_self">at
least not entirely</a>); Trump himself will
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-ranted-about-heat-pumps-evs-and-water-with-tucker-carlson" target="_self">allow
that hybrid cars are “pretty good”</a> during his rants about electric
vehicles. On the other hand, smearing DeSantis as a “liberal
environmentalist” who allegedly hates fracking is still perceived to be
damaging enough in a Republican primary that Haley used her limited
minutes in front of the approximately 17 American viewers who tuned in
on Wednesday night to try, once more, to get it to stick.
</p>
<p style>
Only time will tell if such a barb can harm DeSantis (who, for his part,
continually insists
<a href="https://x.com/RonDeSantis/status/1722460159170023452?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">he
welcomes</a> barbs, as well as arrows, hits, and presumably other
assorted forms of torment). Then again, the whole thing might be moot.
In the next century, the waves of Biscayne Bay could very well

<p>Some time ago I decided to update RAM on my main machine - the Raptor

(16 threads) which is still OK for most of tasks. But these 32 GB of RAM
are not enough for some tasks. I occasionally need to generate some
larger data sets and typical size is about 39 GB. This is OK but it
means swapping to the disk. Not only swapping is not ideal for a SSD but
it also greatly slows things down.</p>

Court Dismisses ‘Insurrection Clause’ Challenge, Allows Trump on
Ballot</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump will stay on the Minnesota primary
ballot after the state supreme court Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit
seeking to end his candidacy under a rarely used constitutional
provision that forbids those who “engaged in insurrection” from holding
office.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Supreme Court declined to become the first in history
to use Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to prevent someone from running
for the presidency. The court dodged the central question of the lawsuit
— does Trump’s role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol
disqualify him from the presidency — by ruling that state law allows
parties to put whomever they want on the primary ballot.</p>
<p>“There is no state statute that prohibits a major political party
from placing on the presidential nomination primary ballot, or sending
delegates to the national convention supporting, a candidate who is
ineligible to hold office,” Chief Justice Natalie Hudson ruled.</p>
<p>The court left open the possibility that plaintiffs could try again
to knock Trump off the general election ballot in November. The
Minnesota challenge was filed by the liberal group Free Speech For
People, which said it will continue its campaign to end Trump’s
presidential bid.</p>
<p>“We are disappointed by the court’s decision,” said the group’s legal
director Ron Fein, who argued before the court at its Nov. 2 hearing on
the case. “However, the Minnesota Supreme Court explicitly recognized
that the question of Donald Trump’s disqualification for engaging in
insurrection against the U.S. Constitution may be resolved at a later
stage. The decision isn’t binding on any court outside Minnesota, and we
continue our current and planned legal actions in other states to
enforce Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment against Donald Trump.”</p>
<p>The ruling is the first from a series of lawsuits filed by Free
Speech For People and a second liberal group that are seeking to use
Section 3 to end the candidacy of the front-runner in the Republican
presidential primary.</p>
<p>On his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump said: “Ridiculous
14th Amendment lawsuit just thrown out by Minnesota Supreme Court.” He
added, “Congratulations to all who fought this HOAX!”</p>
<p>The provision at issue bars from office anyone who swore an oath to
the Constitution and then “engaged in insurrection” against it. It was
mainly used to prevent former confederates from taking over state and
federal government positions after the Civil War.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs in the cases contend that Section 3 is simply another
qualification for the presidency, just like the Constitution’s
requirement that a president be at least 35 years old. They filed in
Minnesota because the state has a quick process to challenge ballot
qualifications, with the case heard directly by the state’s highest
court.</p>
<p>Trump’s attorneys argued that Section 3 has no power without Congress
laying out the criteria and procedures for applying it, that the Jan. 6
attack doesn’t meet the definition of insurrection and that the former
president was simply using his free speech rights. They also argued that
the clause doesn’t apply to the office of the presidency, which is not
mentioned in the text.</p>
<p>Parallel cases are being heard in other states, including Colorado,
where a state judge has scheduled closing arguments for next week.</p>
<p>Many legal experts expect the issue to eventually reach the U.S.
Supreme Court, which has never ruled on Section 3.</p>
<p>Secretaries of state have generally said they don’t have the power to
determine whether Trump should not be on the ballot and have sought
guidance from courts.</p>

id="striking-actors-reach-tentative-deal-with-hollywood-studios">Striking
Actors Reach Tentative Deal With Hollywood Studios</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The SAG-AFTRA actors’ union reached a tentative agreement with
Hollywood studios to resolve the second of two strikes that rocked the
entertainment industry as workers demanded higher pay in the streaming
TV era, the union said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The 118-day strike will end officially just after midnight, SAG-AFTRA
said in a statement. The group’s national board will consider the deal
on Friday, and the union said it would release further details after
that meeting.</p>
<p>Members of SAG-AFTRA walked off the job in mid-July asking for an
increase in minimum salaries, a share of streaming service revenue and
protection from being replaced by “digital replicas” generated by
artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>The union said negotiators had reached a preliminary deal on a new
contract with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers
(AMPTP), which represents Walt Disney DIS.N, Netflix NFLX.O and other
media companies.</p>
<p>An AMPTP representative did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.</p>
<p>The breakthrough means Hollywood can ramp up to full production for
the first time since May, once union members vote to ratify the deal in
the coming weeks.</p>
<p>“I’m relieved,” actor Fanny Grande said in an interview. “It’s been
really difficult for most people in the industry, especially people of
color. As it is, we don’t have as many opportunities. We aren’t big
celebrities that have money in the bank for months. I just really hope
that it’s a fair deal.”</p>
<p>Actors had similar concerns to film and television writers, who
argued that compensation for working-class cast members had dwindled as
streaming took hold, making it hard to earn a living wage in cities such
as Los Angeles and New York. TV series on streaming did not offer the
same residual payments that actors enjoyed during the heyday of
broadcast TV.</p>
<p>Performers also became alarmed by recent advances in artificial
intelligence, which they feared could lead to studios manipulating their
likenesses without permission or replacing human actors with digital
images.</p>
<p>George Clooney and other A-list stars voiced solidarity with
lower-level actors and had urged union leadership, including SAG-AFTRA
President and The Nanny actor Fran Drescher, to reach a resolution.</p>
<p>Many film and TV sets shut down when the Writers Guild of America
(WGA) called a strike in the spring. While WGA members returned to
writing scripts in late September, the ongoing SAG-AFTRA work stoppage
left many productions dark.</p>
<p>The disruptions cost California more than $6 billion in lost output,
according to a Milken Institute estimate.</p>
<p>With little work available, many prop masters, costume designers and
other crew members struggled to make ends meet. FilmLA, the group that
approves filming permits, reported scripted production during the week
of Oct. 29 had fallen 77% from the same time a year earlier.</p>
<p>The Hollywood strikes came during a year of other high-profile job
actions. The United Auto Workers recently ended six weeks of walkouts at
Detroit carmakers. Teachers, nurses and healthcare workers also walked
off the job.</p>
<p>Hollywood’s work stoppages forced broadcast networks to fill their
fall lineups with re-runs, games shows and reality shows. It also led
movie studios to delay big releases such as Dune: Part 2 because
striking actors could not promote them.</p>
<p>Other major films, including the latest installment of the Mission:
Impossible franchise and Disney’s live-action remake of animated classic

similar thing is now haunting OneDrive users on Windows, demanding to

here because Windows will not let you quit OneDrive without answering

<p>I cannot pinpoint the source of this misconception, it could have
been a vendor, or long-lost blog post, or one of the many webinars I
attended in my early days as a program lead. Regardless of the source, I
operated under the wild misconception that all I needed to do was train
my teams to do accessibility. Developers, QAs, designers, all they
needed was training! This model does not work. Especially for an
organization with multiple products, multiple platforms, and multiple
development teams. Accessibility is so much more complicated than can be
summarised in a mere training. It requires experts, capable programmers,
users who actually require said accessbility, and so much more. It’s
also an ongoing process – it’s not a static “train once, use everywhere”
kind of deal.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-know-ahead-of-third-republican-presidential-debate">What
to Know Ahead of Third Republican Presidential Debate</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican
Party’s 2024 presidential nomination, will be a no-show at the third
candidates debate Wednesday night in Florida, opting instead to host an
event nearby. But five other conservative presidential hopefuls will be
looking for breakthroughs.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s debate will be broadcast live from the Adrienne Arsht
Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County from 8 to 10 p.m.
Eastern time on NBC News and Rumble, a  livestreaming platform.</p>
<p>Since the first Republican debate in Milwaukee more than two months
ago, former Vice President Mike Pence has left the race and former
Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and Governor Doug Burgum of North
Dakota have been swept aside, having raised too little money to qualify
for Wednesday night’s forum.</p>
<p>Those still in contention — and willing to show up to the debate —
are Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, biotech businessman Vivek Ramaswamy,
former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, former New Jersey Governor Chris
Christie and U.S. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina.</p>
<p>Here’s what to know about the candidates’ positions on key issues
that are likely to come up.</p>
<p>Foreign policy</p>
<p>There are two competing approaches to foreign policy to look for
tonight: hawkish neoconservativism from Haley and isolationism — Trump’s
brand of diplomacy that Ramaswamy and DeSantis seem to be mimicking.</p>
<p>Haley sees military aid to Israel and Ukraine as crucial to
preserving Western interests abroad. Scott and Christie agree that
helping Israel and Ukraine in their war efforts is crucial.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy, on the other hand, wants out of what he calls “no-win
wars” and recently said the U.S.’s job is not “to be the global police.”
To Ramaswamy, successful foreign policy means cutting off many U.S.
allies from support.</p>
<p>DeSantis has similarly argued that helping Ukraine’s counteroffensive
is not a priority, echoing Trump’s controversial “America first”
stance.</p>
<p>Super political action committees for Haley and DeSantis have
repeatedly aired campaign ads accusing each other of being too easy on
China. Those ads leveled claims that fact-checkers have called into
doubt, including that Haley allowed a Chinese corporation to “get
dangerously close” to a U.S. Army base and another that “DeSantis voted
to fast-track” Obama-era trade deals with China.</p>
<p>Expect Haley and DeSantis to defend themselves and spar over their
views on China and more.</p>
<p>Abortion</p>
<p>Progressives made inroads in state-level elections Tuesday in winning
back abortion rights, which the U.S. Supreme Court returned to the
states’ purview when it struck down Roe v. Wade in June 2022. Some
states have greatly restricted abortion rights since then.</p>
<p>The Republican candidates differ in their views on abortion.</p>
<p>Haley, DeSantis and Scott would sign a nationwide ban on abortions
after 15 weeks. They haven’t said whether they would allow exceptions in
instances of rape or incest or when a pregnancy could be fatal.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy and Christie, while both personally against abortions, have
said that they would not support a federal ban, citing the 10th
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which some legal scholars say gives
decision-making authority over abortion bans to the states.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy has advocated for six-week abortion bans at the state level
but said he wouldn’t use executive authority to impose them.</p>
<p>Both Ramaswamy and Christie support exceptions in instances of rape
or incest or when a pregnancy could be fatal.</p>
<p>As governor of Florida, DeSantis helped outlaw mifepristone, a
hormone-blocking drug that is used in medication abortions. Haley has
said the legality of mifepristone should be decided by elected officials
at the state level.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy, Christie and Scott haven’t elaborated their positions on
mifepristone.</p>
<p>Immigration</p>
<p>Ramaswamy, himself the child of immigrants, has perhaps the harshest
policies on immigration. He has said that he would deport every
undocumented immigrant and deploy the military at the southern U.S.
border to halt any more mass crossings.</p>
<p>Haley has said she would make it more difficult for undocumented
immigrants to find jobs and that immigration officials should carry out
deportations.</p>
<p>DeSantis has said he would deport undocumented immigrants,
particularly those who overstay their visas or are found guilty of
crimes. In Florida, he clamped down on undocumented immigration.</p>
<p>Scott has supported bringing back Title 42, which forces out migrants
without any legal proceedings, but hasn’t said whether he would deport
undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>Christie has supported mass deportations, and as governor of New
Jersey he rejected a national program that helped immigrants find new
beginnings in his state.</p>
<p>Haley, Scott and Christie are against breaking up families.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy, DeSantis and Haley are against birthright citizenship.</p>
<p>Trump</p>
<p>New polling from The New York Times and Siena College shows that
Trump is beating President Joe Biden in five of six battleground states.
Analysts say that should worry Trump’s party rivals, who all trail him
by some distance.</p>
<p>But not all are so sure of Trump’s campaign.</p>
<p>Christie has made a name for himself among the Republican candidates
as Trump’s harshest critic, claiming that Trump’s legal battles will
make it harder to beat Biden as the primaries approach.</p>
<p>Haley has likewise called Trump’s trials “a distraction” from the
larger goal of getting a Republican in the White House.</p>
<p>Haley blasted Trump for being too cozy with authoritarian leaders, in
a recent meeting with the Republican Jewish Coalition, which is a
co-sponsor of tonight’s debate. Trump has a record of praising dictators
such as North Korea’s Kim Jong Un and Russia’s Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>DeSantis also has said that Trump “views everything from the lens of
him,” referring to how Trump’s legal dramas may have clouded his
message.</p>
<p>Scott recently said that Trump isn’t electable in 2024. “I don’t
think he can win,” Scott said in late October. “You have to be able to
win in Georgia. I don’t think he can win in Georgia.”</p>
<p>Of all the contenders, Ramaswamy has been the least critical of
Trump.</p>
<p>As Haley and DeSantis vie for second place, expect them to make their
cases for why Republican voters should want them over Trump.</p>
<p>Climate</p>
<p>DeSantis hasn’t said whether he thinks human activity is the main
cause of climate change. Haley, Christie and Scott, however, have.
Ramaswamy has said that human activity causing climate change is
probable but has never expressed certainty.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy and Scott have publicly doubted that climate change is
making natural disasters more lethal, with Ramaswamy having said at the
first Republican debate that “the climate change agenda is a hoax.”</p>
<p>All the candidates who will take the stage at tonight’s debate have
said that the market is better suited than the government to handle
climate change.</p>
<p>DeSantis, Haley, Ramaswamy and Scott are opposed to rebate programs
for drivers of clean-energy vehicles. Christie hasn’t given his position
on tax credits yet.</p>
<p>If the impacts of climate change come up, expect Ramaswamy to be the
most vocal denier as in previous debates.</p>
<p>Guns</p>
<p>All the candidates who will appear at tonight’s debate are against
restricting access to firearms for those who might pose threats to
themselves or others. They also oppose expanding background checks,
except for Ramaswamy, who hasn’t yet made his opinions on that
known.</p>
<p>Of all the topics that might come up tonight, what to do — or not to
do — about gun violence will likely be among the least contentious for
the candidates, who broadly see eye to eye on the Second Amendment right
to keep and bear arms.</p>

Sporty EV Pickup of My Dreams Is Coming — But Not to America</h2>

My wife drove one of the last great little trucks. The 2000 Toyota
Tacoma had no extended cab and no frills, just a bench seat and a short
bed to shuttle her stuff back and forth from L.A. to Berkeley. To no
one’s surprise, it still runs. We just moved a loveseat in it this
weekend.
</p>
<p style>
That kind of two-door utilitarian pickup, which was commonplace in the
heyday of the Chevy S-10 and Ford Ranger, is critically endangered in
the era of supersized F-150s and Ram 1500s. And the new EVs in the truck
space are predictably big. Toyota, though, just revealed an electrified
version of the simple little truck: the
<a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/toyota-hilux-revo-bev-concept-first-look/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hilux
REVO EV</a>, an updated, modernized version of my wife’s classic
two-door.
</p>
<p style>
I want it. It is in Southeast Asia.
</p>
<p style>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps" style>
“Why can’t we have this in America” is a familiar refrain in the
automotive world. It’s been especially fitting in the last couple of
decades, as the American car market consolidated around big trucks and
crossovers, the only vehicles that sell en masse. Other countries get
station wagons, hatchbacks, tiny city cars, small pickup trucks, and
other shapes that make enthusiasts swoon, but don’t reach the U.S.
market because they don’t sell in high volume here. (You can’t just buy
one and import it, either, because of the United States’s
<a href="https://www.autoweek.com/car-life/a1707441/who-really-benefits-25-year-import-rule/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">25-year
rule</a>.)
</p>
<p>
The Hilux is a perfect example. Toyota’s global truck is the
<a href="https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/features/toyota-hilux-profile" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">world’s
workhorse</a>, selling countless numbers in countries where a pickup is
meant to be a beater, not a cushy family car that happens to have a bed
in the back. The Hilux is notoriously dependable and serviceable. Parts
are easy to find since so many of these things exist around the world.
You just can’t buy one in the United States, where, since the 1990s,
Toyota has sold the larger, comfier Tacoma to compete with the monster
trucks on American roads.
</p>
<p style>
Toyota showed off the Hilux REVO EV last month in Thailand, one of the
biggest markets for the traditional gas-powered Hilux. The truck is a
one-off concept that engineers from Toyota Thailand built using the
brand’s EV parts. While the demo is far from becoming a production
vehicle, it’s an interesting move by Toyota. The world’s largest
automaker has been conspicuously slow in electrification, allowing the
other legacy car companies to make their big EV splashes first. Toyota
President Akio Toyoda has said
<a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/a45546378/toyota-tacoma-ev-pickup-plans/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more
than once</a> that the car industry has put the cart before the horse
with electrification, and that Toyota will not race to produce EVs until
it is confident the infrastructure those EVs need is in place.
</p>
<p style>
When that infrastructure <em>is</em> in place, Toyota will be in
position to offer the world the battery-powered small pickup of my
dreams. Here in America, the brand’s
<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a38513569/toyota-electric-pickup-truck-concept/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">eventual
EV truck offering</a> is liable to be a much bigger boy. But are we
really sure a smaller EV truck can’t succeed here?
</p>
<p style>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps" style>
To American drivers lusting after the small trucks available overseas,
the car companies had a ready-made reply: <em>Sorry, but the numbers
don’t lie</em>. Full-size pickups are the best-selling vehicles in
America. By comparison, compact trucks aren’t worth the effort. Ford’s
mid-size Maverick is a success story, but
<a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/ford-maverick-sales-jump-83-4-in-q3-as-deliveries-speed-up" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its
sales</a> still can’t hold a candle to the more than 500,000 F-150s and
Silverados
<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/g39628015/best-selling-cars-2022/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sold
in America</a> each year.
</p>
<p style>
The legacy carmakers thought it could replicate the same dynamic to spur
America’s transition to EVs. The Ford F-150 Lightning is available, and
the electrified Chevy, Ram, and GMC full-size trucks are coming soon to
form the vanguard of Detroit’s big EV push. But it’s not clear the old
rules hold true in the new world. Full-size truck owners say they are
troublingly
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/automakers-are-starting-to-quietly-slow-down-their-plans-for-electric-pickups" target="_self">unwilling</a>
to consider buying an EV as their next pickup. The people who do buy EVs
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/electric-cars-partisanship-problem" target="_self">trend
urban and Democratic</a>, the kind of people more likely to drive a
Honda Civic than a Ram 1500.
</p>
<p>
In other words, the EV market — at least for now — doesn’t look a lot
like the overall American auto market. And maybe that’s an opportunity
for the forsaken car shapes to stage a comeback. Chevrolet looked like
it would kill off the plucky Bolt to make way for electrified SUVs and
trucks. Amid steep headwinds in that effort, the brand says the
<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a44639082/chevrolet-bolt-ev-second-generation-details/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bolt
is coming back</a>.
</p>
<p style>
A reasonably sized pickup truck could be just the ticket for the urban
dwellers who are actually interested in buying EVs. The pickups
available now, the Rivian R1T and Ford F-150 Lightning, are simply too
much truck for a lot of people. Their huge batteries can deliver a ton
of power — just ask actor Alan Ruck, who
<a href="https://heatmap.news/alan-ruck-crash-rivian-los-angeles" target="_self">crashed</a>
his into a Hollywood pizzeria last week. As much as I lust after the
Rivian when I see one around Los Angeles, I couldn’t get it into my
parking space. You know what would fit in there? The Hilux EV.
</p>
<p style>
My wish is that the EV revolution sets the pickup free. The sovereignty
of the oversized truck is tied to its capability, sure, but also its
status as a market of tribal membership. Country songs name-drop Chevy
Silverados for a reason, and lots of people who wouldn’t dare get mud on
their boots own a King Ranch. Given that trucks skew right, and EVs
still skew left, the EV truck exists in a liminal political space.
Perhaps that’s enough to redefine the form, and make the electrified
pickup about practicality more than posturing.

id="google-argues-imessage-should-be-regulated-by-the-eus-digital-markets-act">Google
argues iMessage should be regulated by the EU’s Digital Markets Act</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Google is hoping regulators will bail it out of the messaging mess it
has created for itself after years of dysfunctional product reboots. The
Financial Times reports that Google and a few cell carriers are asking
the EU to designate Apple’s iMessage as a “core” service that would
require it to be interoperable under the new “Digital Markets Act.” The
EU’s Digital Markets Act targets Big Tech “gatekeepers” with various
interoperability, fairness, and privacy demands, and while iMessage
didn’t make the initial cut of services announced in September, Apple’s
messenger is under a “market investigation” to determine if it should
qualify. The criteria for gatekeeper services all revolve around
business usage. The services the EU wants to include would have more
than 45 million monthly active EU users and more than 10,000 yearly
active business in the EU, a business turnover of at least 7.5 billion
euros, or a market cap of 75 billion euros, with the caveat that these
are just guidelines and the EU is open to arguments in both directions.
When the initial list was announced back in September, the EU said that
iMessage actually met the thresholds for regulation, but it was left off
the list while it listens to Apple’s arguments that it should not
qualify. The sooner the various messaging services are forced to
interoperate – preferably via completely open specifications anyone can
build for – the better. These services should not be locking users
in.</p>

id="house-republicans-subpoena-biden-son-brother-in-impeachment-inquiry">House
Republicans Subpoena Biden Son, Brother in Impeachment Inquiry</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>House Republicans issued subpoenas Wednesday to members of President
Joe Biden’s family, taking their most aggressive step yet in an
impeachment inquiry bitterly opposed by Democrats that is testing the
reach of congressional oversight powers. </p>
<p>The long-awaited move by Rep. James Comer, the chairman of the House
Oversight Committee, to subpoena the president’s son Hunter and his
brother James comes as Republicans look to gain ground in their nearly
yearlong investigation. So far, they have failed to uncover evidence
directly implicating the president in any wrongdoing. </p>
<p>But Republicans say the evidence trail they have uncovered paints a
troubling picture of “influence peddling” by Biden’s family in their
business dealings, particularly with clients overseas. </p>
<p>“Now, the House Oversight Committee is going to bring in members of
the Biden family and their associates to question them on this record of
evidence,” Comer, of Kentucky, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The stakes are exceedingly high, as the inquiry could result in
Republicans bringing impeachment charges against Biden, the ultimate
penalty for what the U.S. Constitution describes as “high crimes and
misdemeanors.”</p>
<p>The subpoenas demand that Hunter Biden and James Biden as well as
former business associate Rob Walker appear before the Oversight
Committee for a deposition. Lawmakers also requested that James Biden’s
wife, Sara Biden, and Hallie Biden, the wife of the president’s deceased
son Beau, appear voluntarily for transcribed interviews.</p>
<p>Requests for comment from Hunter Biden, who lives in California, and
James Biden, who’s from Royal Oak, Maryland, were not immediately
returned.</p>
<p>Both the White House and the Biden family’s personal lawyers have
dismissed the investigation as a political ploy aimed at hurting the
Democratic president. They say the probe is a blatant attempt to help
former President Donald Trump, the early front-runner for the 2024 GOP
presidential nomination, as he runs again for the White House.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden’s attorney, Abbe Lowell, said the investigation has been
full of “worn-out, false, baseless, or debunked claims.” In a letter to
House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday morning, Lowell urged the new
speaker to rein in the “partisan political games.” </p>
<p>Johnson, now settling into the speakership after replacing Kevin
McCarthy as the top Republican in the House, has given his blessing to
the inquiry and has hinted that a decision could come soon on whether to
pursue articles of impeachment against Biden. </p>
<p>“I think we have a constitutional responsibility to follow this truth
where it leads,” Johnson told Fox News Channel recently. He also said in
a separate Fox interview that he would support Comer’s decision to
subpoena the president’s son, saying “desperate times call for desperate
measures, and that perhaps is overdue.”</p>
<p>Since January, Republicans have been investigating the Biden family
for what they claim is a pattern of “influence peddling” spanning back
to when Biden was Barack Obama’s vice president. Comer claims the
committee had “uncovered a mountain of evidence” that he said would show
how Biden abused his power and repeatedly lied about the separation
between his political position and his son’s private business
dealings.</p>
<p>While questions have arisen about the ethics surrounding the Biden
family’s international business, no evidence has emerged to prove that
Joe Biden, in his current or previous office, abused his role or
accepted bribes.</p>

id="husband-of-journalist-jailed-in-russia-calls-on-us-for-help">Husband
of Journalist Jailed in Russia Calls on US for Help</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The husband of Alsu Kurmasheva, a journalist jailed in Russia on
accusations that she failed to register as a foreign agent, is calling
on the U.S. government to declare her “wrongfully detained.”</p>
<p>Kurmasheva, an American-Russian dual citizen, was detained on October
18. Authorities ordered her held until at least December 5.</p>
<p>The editor works with the Tatar-Bashkir service for Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty, or RFE/RL. She and her media outlet deny the
charges against her.   </p>
<p>In his first public comments since Kurmasheva’s detention, her
husband, Pavel Butorin, is urging the United States to classify the
journalist as “wrongfully detained,” which would open additional
government resources to help secure her release.</p>
<p>“We’re already very grateful for the support that we are receiving,”
Butorin told VOA’s sister outlet RFE/RL. “This is a very important
designation, the kind that comes from the United States government and
from the State Department.”</p>
<p>Butorin, like Kurmasheva, works from the RFE/RL offices in Prague.
Butorin heads Current Time TV, a Russian-language TV and digital network
led by RFE/RL in partnership with VOA. </p>
<p>“There is nothing we want to happen more than to get Alsu back. My
children need her. I need my wife back,” Butorin said.</p>
<p>Kurmasheva has had no contact with her family since her arrest. </p>
<p>The journalist had traveled to Russia in May for a family emergency.
When she tried to return to Prague in June, her passports were
confiscated. She was waiting for those documents to be returned when
authorities detained her on October 18. </p>
<p>Now, Kurmasheva is facing five years in prison for allegedly
violating Russia’s “foreign agent” law.</p>
<p>Moscow says its foreign agent law is a response to the U.S. Foreign
Agent Registration Act, but analysts say that the Kremlin uses the
designation to target critics. </p>
<p>Russia designated the U.S. Congress-funded RFE/RL a foreign agent in
2020.</p>
<p>The independent network refused to comply with the requirement to
register as a foreign agent, saying it would be an invasion of its
editorial processes and would limit the ability of the network to
work.</p>
<p>U.S. officials and the U.N. Human Rights Office, along with media
freedom and human rights groups, have called on Moscow to release
Kurmasheva. </p>
<p>“This appears to be another case of the Russian government harassing
U.S. citizens,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in
October.</p>
<p>Russia’s Washington embassy did not immediately reply to VOA’s email
requesting comment. </p>
<p>One of two journalists detained this year</p>
<p>Kurmasheva is the second American journalist jailed in Russia this
year. </p>
<p>In March, Russian authorities detained American Wall Street Journal
reporter Evan Gershkovich on espionage charges that he, his employer and
the U.S. government deny. </p>
<p>Declared wrongfully detained by the U.S. government, Gershkovich, 32,
is in pre-trial detention until at least November 30. The detention
period has been twice extended and appeals for bail denied.</p>
<p>“It’s really hard to believe that our colleague, Wall Street Journal
reporter Evan Gershkovich, has now been wrongfully detained for more
than six months,” Almar Latour, chief executive of Dow Jones and
publisher of The Wall Street Journal, said Tuesday at an Atlantic
Council event about threats facing foreign correspondents.</p>
<p>“In 2023, journalism is under attack. Make no mistake about it,”
Latour said. </p>
<p>Paul Beckett, an assistant editor at the Journal who is focused on
securing Gershkovich’s release, said the reporter is “in pretty decent
shape” considering the circumstances. He added that the letters of
support Gershkovich receives mean “a massive amount.”</p>
<p>The jailings of Gershkovich and Kurmasheva underscore global threats
facing press freedom.  </p>
<p>At the end of 2022, a record high of 363 reporters were jailed around
the world, according to research by the Committee to Protect
Journalists. Of those, 19 were detained in Russia.</p>
<p>“The environment for journalists everywhere has deteriorated
dramatically in recent years, and that’s in part because we’re seeing a
global decline in democracy,” CPJ president Jodie Ginsberg said at the
Atlantic Council.</p>

<h2 id="fda-approves-new-version-of-diabetes-drug-for-weight-loss">FDA
Approves New Version of Diabetes Drug for Weight Loss</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A new version of the popular diabetes treatment Mounjaro can be sold
as a weight-loss drug, U.S. regulators announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Eli Lilly’s Zepbound,
or tirzepatide. The drug helped dieters lose about a quarter of their
body weight, or 27 kilograms, in a recent study.</p>
<p>Zepbound is the latest diabetes drug approved for weight loss,
joining Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy, a high-dose version of its diabetes
treatment Ozempic.</p>
<p>The FDA approved Lilly’s drug for people who are considered obese,
with a body mass index of 30 or higher, or those who are overweight with
a related health condition, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol
or diabetes. The drug should be paired with a healthy diet and regular
exercise, the FDA said.</p>
<p>In the U.S., at least 100 million adults and about 15 million
children are considered obese.</p>
<p>The drug tirzepatide in Zepbound and Mounjaro and semaglutide in
Wegovy and Ozempic work by mimicking hormones that kick in after people
eat to regulate appetite and the feeling of fullness. Both imitate a
hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1, known as GLP-1. Tirzepatide
targets a second hormone, called glucose-dependent insulinotropic
polypeptide, or GIP.</p>
<p>Zepbound appears to spur greater weight loss than Wegovy. Approved
for chronic weight management in 2021, Wegovy helped people lose about
15% of their body weight or 15.4 kilograms, according to study
results.</p>
<p>“This would be the most highly efficacious drug ever approved for the
treatment of obesity,” said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, an obesity
medicine expert at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.</p>
<p>Touted by celebrities and on social media, semaglutide and
tirzepatide have been in such demand that their manufacturers have
struggled to keep up. Both have been listed on the FDA’s drug shortage
site for months. All strengths of tirzepatide are currently listed as
available, but a company spokesperson said that could vary by location
and demand.</p>
<p>Side effects of the new weight-loss drug include vomiting, nausea,
diarrhea, constipation and other gastrointestinal problems. In the most
recent published trial, about 10% of people taking tirzepatide dropped
out of the study because of such problems, compared to about 2% of
people taking dummy shots.</p>
<p>While experts lauded approval of Zepbound, they worried that it
wouldn’t necessarily mean greater access to the drug, which has been
prescribed off-label to help people pare pounds.</p>
<p>“Most patients won’t be able to afford Zepbound without insurance
coverage and many health plans exclude obesity care,” said Dr. Katherine
Saunders, an obesity expert at New York’s Weill Cornell Medicine and
co-founder of company focused on obesity treatment.</p>
<p>Eli Lilly and Co. said the list price will be about $1,000 a month,
the same as Mounjaro. Medicare is prohibited from covering drugs
specifically for weight loss.</p>
<p>Kelly Burns, 50, of St. Petersburg, Florida, lost nearly 45 kilograms
using tirzepatide after joining a study of the drug to treat obesity in
2021. When testing ended and she no longer had access to the medication,
she struggled, but eventually lost another 23 kilograms.</p>
<p>“My whole life is completely different,” she said. Her health
measurements improved and her confidence soared. Now that it is approved
for weight loss, Burns plans to ask her insurance company about
coverage.</p>
<p>“It would be ridiculous not to,” she said, adding: “I want to stay
this way as long as I possibly can.”</p>

id="former-somali-refugee-elected-mayor-of-minnesota-city-making-history">Former
Somali Refugee Elected Mayor of Minnesota City, Making History</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Voters in the Minnesota city of St. Louis Park elected Nadia Mohamed,
a 27-year-old Somali-American, as the city’s first Black, first Somali,
and first Muslim mayor Tuesday night.</p>
<p>The election results show that Mohamed easily defeated Dale Anderson,
a former banker and continuing education teacher, by a margin of 58% to
41%.</p>
<p>“I am very happy to win as Somali-American, Muslim, migrant and
Black,” she told VOA’s Somali Service. “I would say thank you to all of
those who supported me in this. It is our victory.”</p>
<p>Maine State Rep. Deqa Dhalac was the first Somali American to serve
as mayor of an American city in 2021, when South Portland’s six-member
council selected Dhalac for the role. Mohamed becomes the first Somali
mayor in American history elected directly by voters.</p>
<p>“I have lived in this city for 18 years,” said Mohamed. “I grew up
and finished my school here, so it was easy for me to get elected
because people know me.”</p>
<p>An early start</p>
<p>As refugees, Mohamed’s family moved to St. Louis Park when she was 10
years old.</p>
<p>Mohamed says her aspirations for elected office started with routine
recreational walks when she was young.</p>
<p>“I would walk around the city hall and could only see the portraits
of city’s former mayors on the walls. All of them were white men. I only
saw two women. None of them looked like me,” she said. “But now, I am
very happy, and it is amazing to see my photo among these mayors,
knowing that — let us say, 50 years from now — it will be still
here.</p>
<p>“Muslim, black and migrant girls will have a better opportunity to
see one of them among these mayors,” she said.</p>
<p>Mohamed in 2019 was elected to the St. Louis Park City Council at the
age of 23, making her the youngest individual to hold the position in
the 170-year history of the Minneapolis suburb.</p>
<p>Before public office, she also held a position at the Minnesota
Department of Human Services as a diversity, equity and inclusion
specialist.</p>
<p>Predominantly white St. Louis Park, a city of roughly 50,000, has
seen the number of people of color more than double over the past two
decades, reaching 20% of the population. Some 10% of residents are
foreign-born, and the average household income is $87,639.</p>
<p>The city’s mayor is also its manager, responsible for executive-level
operations. The mayor also chairs the City Council.</p>
<p>Mohamed will succeed Jake Spano, who announced in March that he would
not seek reelection and endorsed Mohamed.</p>
<p>Other Somali-American successes</p>
<p>In nearby Minneapolis on Tuesday, another Somali-American, Ward 6
City Councilman Jamal Osman, defended his seat, receiving 44.6% of the
vote, followed by Kayseh Magan with 30.1% and Tiger Worku with
21.8%.</p>
<p>Speaking to his supporters after the election results were in, Osman
said he was happy and felt grateful to be trusted by Ward 6 residents
for three consecutive years.</p>
<p>“I’m super excited,” Osman said. “We have a lot of work going on. We
have a lot of work to do.”</p>
<p>In 2022, at least eight Somali-American women won races in U.S.
midterm elections.</p>
<p>The success of Somali-American female candidates in the U.S. eclipses
that of female aspirants for elected office in Somalia.</p>
<p>Female politicians in Somalia are so disenfranchised that in 2016,
Somalia’s federal and regional leaders had to start allocating a
specific quota of seats in parliament. But women still were never given
the opportunity to get the 30% quota promised.</p>
<p>In 2016, Somali women occupied 24% of the 329 seats in the two houses
of parliament. In 2022, female candidates secured 20%, well short of the
30% quota.</p>

<h2 id="china-takes-back-washingtons-pandas-amid-frosty-diplomacy">China
Takes Back Washington’s Pandas Amid Frosty Diplomacy</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The trio of giant pandas in the Smithsonian National Zoo are heading
back to China on Wednesday, leaving only a handful of giant pandas in
North America amid tense diplomatic relations between the U.S. and
China.</p>
<p>Now age 25 and 26 respectively, the pandas Mei Xiang and Tian Tian
came to the U.S. in 2000 and have been a mainstay in the Washington zoo
ever since.</p>
<p>In 2020, they had a cub named Xiao Qi Ji, or “Little Miracle” in
English. But now the parents and the cub are embarking on a 19 hour-long
flight to Chengdu, China, aboard a cargo plane.</p>
<p>The Smithsonian National Zoo has spent millions over the years,
particularly to help the pandas breed healthily, and has paid $500,000
annually to its Chinese conservation counterpart, according to the zoo’s
most recent contract.</p>
<p>In the early morning, reporters saw the pandas in large, ventilated
crates and boxes of apples and bamboo shoots being hauled out of the
zoo.</p>
<p>The pandas’ one-way trip home came as expected: The agreement that
brought them to the U.S. stipulated their return. But many see the
trio’s departure as a sign of the times as the geopolitical rift between
East and West widens.</p>
<p>When it comes to lending pandas to zoos abroad, the Chinese
government prefers “nations with whom China’s relations are on the
upswing, as a form of soft power projection,” Kurt Tong, a managing
partner of the Asia Group consultancy, told Agence France-Presse.</p>
<p>Relations between Washington and Beijing have been strained by years
of disagreements over trade, human rights abuses and the status of
Taiwan.</p>
<p>According to Tong, “it is not surprising that Chinese authorities are
allowing panda contracts with U.S. zoos to expire.”</p>
<p>The Washington zoo held a weeklong “Panda Palooza” in September to
bid farewell to the bears. Over the last few months, thousands of panda
lovers visited to say their goodbyes.</p>
<p>Zoo Atlanta in Georgia plans to return its pandas in 2024, meaning
Mexico City’s Xin Xin will likely be the only panda left on the
continent.</p>
<p>The first pandas came to American zoos in 1972, after then-President
Richard Nixon’s famous visit to China.</p>
<p>Some information for this report was provided by Agence
France-Presse.</p>

Biden wants to ban ripoff “financial advisors” (08 Nov 2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Biden wants to ban ripoff “financial advisors”: Big
gubmint wants to take away your freedom to starve to death in old age.
Announcing The Lost Cause Tour: LA, Stratford, Concord, Simsbury,
Toronto, New York and Chapel Hill! Hey look at this: Delights to
delectate. This day in history: 2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent
publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects,
current reading Biden wants to ban ripoff “financial advisors”
(permalink) Once, American workers had “defined benefits pensions,”
where their employers promised to pay them a certain amount every year
from their retirement to their death. Jimmy Carter swapped that out for
401(k)s, “market” pensions where you have to guess which stocks will be
valuable or starve in your old age:
https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/25/derechos-humanos/#are-there-no-poorhouses
The initial 401(k) rollout had all kinds of pot-sweeteners that made
them seem like a good deal, like heavy employer matching that doubled or
even tripled the value of every dollar you put into the market for your
retirement. But over the years, as Reaganomics took hold and workers’
power ebbed away, all these goodies were clawed back. In the end, the
market-based pension makes you the sucker at the poker table, flushing
your savings into a rigged casino that is firmly tilted in favor of
finance barons and other eminently guillotineable plutocrats.
Neoliberalism is many things, but most of all it is a cult of
individualism. The fact that three generations of workers are nows
facing down retirement without pensions that will provide them with
secure housing and food – let alone money to see the odd movie, buy
birthday gifts for their grandkids, or enjoy a meal out now and then –
is framed as millions of individual failures, not a systemic one. In
other words, if you are facing food insecurity and homelessness after a
lifetime of hard work, it’s because you saved wrong. Perhaps you didn’t
save enough (through a 40-year run of wage stagnation and skyrocketing
housing, health and education costs). Or perhaps you saved wrong, making
the wrong bets on the stock market. If you can’t afford to run your air
conditioner during a heat dome, that’s on you: you should have been
better at stocks. Apologists for this system will say that you don’t
have to be good at stocks – you just have to pay an Independent
Financial Advisor to pick the stocks for you and you’ll be fine. But
IFAs don’t work for free! What if you can’t afford one? Enter “predatory
inclusion” – the practice of offering scammy, overpriced and substandard
products to poor people and declaring it to be a good deed, because
otherwise, those poor people would have to do without. The crypto bubble
relied heavily on this: think of Spike Lee and others shilling for
pump-and-dump scams as a way of “building Black wealth”:
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/07/business/media/cryptocurrency-seeks-the-spotlight-with-spike-lees-help.html
More recently, Intuit and other scammy tax-prep services have argued
against the IRS’s plan to offer free tax preparation as bad for Black
and brown people, because it will deny them the chance to be deceived
and ripped off with TurboTax:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/27/predatory-inclusion/#equal-opportunity-scammers
Back in 2018, Trump won the predatory inclusion Olympics, when his
Department of Labor let the Fifth Circuit abolish the “Fiduciary Rule”
for Independent Financial Advisors:
https://www.investopedia.com/updates/dol-fiduciary-rule/ What was the
Fiduciary Rule? It said that your IFN had to put your interests ahead of
their own. Like, if there were two different funds you could bet on, and
one would pay your IFN a big commission, while the other would be a
better bet for you, the IFN couldn’t put your retirement savings into
the fund that offered them a bribe. When Trump killed the Fiduciary
Rule, he proclaimed it a victory for poor people, especially Black and
brown people. After all, if IFNs weren’t allowed to accept bribes for
giving you bad financial advice, then they would have to make up the
difference by charging you for good advice. If you couldn’t afford that
advice, well, you’d have to make bad retirement investments on your own,
without the benefit of their sleazy self-dealing. The Biden
Administration wants to change that. Biden’s Acting Labor Secretary is
Julie Su, and she’s very good at her job. Last spring, she forced west
coast dockworkers’ bosses to cough up the contract they’d stalled on for
a year, with 8-10% raises for every worker, owed retroactively:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/06/16/that-boy-aint-right/#dinos-rinos-and-dunnos
Su has proposed a way to reinstate the Fiduciary Rule, as part of the
Biden Administration’s war on junk fees, estimating that this will
increase retirees’ net savings by 20%:
https://prospect.org/labor/2023-11-07-julie-su-labor-retirement-savers/
The new rule will force advisors who cheat their clients to pay
restitution, and will require them to deliver all their advice in
writing so that this cheating can be detected and punished. The industry
is furious, of course. They claim that “The Market (TM)” will solve
this: if you get bad retirement savings advice and end up homeless and
starving, then you will choose a different advisor in your next life,
after you are reincarnated (I guess?). And of course, they’re also
claiming that forcing IFNs to stop cheating their clients will deny poor
people access to expert (bad) advice. As the Financial Services
Institute’s Dale Brown says, this will have a “negative impact on Main
Street Americans’ access to financial advice”:
https://www.fa-mag.com/news/legal-challenge-predicted-for-new-dol-fiduciary-proposal-75257.html
Here’s that rule – read it for yourself, then submit a comment
expressing your views on it. The government wants to hear from you, and
administrative law requires them to act on the comments they receive:
https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/03/2023-23782/proposed-amendment-to-prohibited-transaction-exemptions-75-1-77-4-80-83-83-1-and-86-128
Su is part of a wave of progressive, technically skilled regulators in
the Biden administration that resulted from a horse-trading exercise
called the Unity Task Force, which divvied up access to top appointments
among the progressive wing and the finance wing of the Democratic Party.
The progressive appointments are nothing short of incredible – the most
competent and principled agency leaders America has seen in half a
century: https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/23/getting-stuff-done/#praxis
But then there’s the finance wing’s appointments, like Judge Jacqueline
Scott Corley, who ruled against Lina Khan’s attempt to block the rotten
Microsoft/Activision merger (don’t worry, Khan’s appealing):
https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/14/making-good-trouble/#the-peoples-champion
Perhaps the worst, though, is Biden’s Secretary of Commerce Gina
Raimondo, a private equity ghoul who did a stint for the notorious
wreckers Bain Capital before founding her own firm. Raimondo has stuffed
her department full of Goldman Sachs alums, and has sidelined labor and
civil society groups as she sets out to administer everything from the
CHIPS Act to regulating ChatGPT. As Henry Burke writes for the Revolving
Door Project and The American Prospect, Raimondo’s history as a
corporate raider, her deference to the finance sector, and she and her
husband’s conflicts of interest from their massive stakes in companies
she’s regulating all serve to undermine Biden’s agenda:
https://prospect.org/economy/2023-11-08-commerce-secretary-gina-raimondo-undercutting-bidenomics/
When the administration inevitably complains that its popular economic
programs aren’t breaking through the media coverage, they’ll have no one
to blame but themselves. The Unity Task Force gave us generationally
important policymakers, but ultimately, it’s a classic “pizzaburger.” If
half your family wants pizza, and the other half wants burgers, and you
serve them something halfway in between that makes none of them happy,
you haven’t made a wise compromise – you’ve just made an inedible mess:

Island: Gateway to America in Early 20th Century</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Immigration in the U.S. wasn’t always difficult or a crisis. Just 100
years ago, immigrants arriving in America simply had to give their name,
occupation, and port of call when crossing into the  U.S.   Millions
arrived through Ellis Island, an immigration and processing center
that operated for more than 62 years. It stopped processing migrants 70
years ago this month.  Evgeny Maslov reports on what it was like for
immigrants on Ellis Island in this story narrated by Anna Rice.</p>

<p>“Both sides will have to say something about Taiwan, but this is not
the kind of environment in which they can sit down and have a frank
conversation about what each side’s approach is going to be,” Kharis
Templeman, a research fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover
Institution, told VOA in a video interview. </p>
<p>He thinks Beijing and Washington will try to talk about Taiwan “as
little as possible.”</p>
<p>“There is an election in Taiwan in January that could shake things
up, so neither side has the incentive to try to be bold and reach out to
the other side or deviate from the path that they have taken over the
last couple of years in the trilateral relationship [between the U.S.,
China, and Taiwan,]” Templeman added. </p>
<p>China views Taiwan as part of its territory and vows to reunite with
the self-ruled democracy one day, through force if necessary. In recent
years, Beijing has increased its military intimidation campaign around
Taiwan, repeatedly sending military aircraft into Taiwan’s air defense
identification zone and staging blockade-style military exercises around
the island. </p>
<p>Despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, the U.S. has
long upheld a policy of ensuring it can defend itself, and has done so
through regular sales of military equipment. U.S. military sales to
Taiwan have become more frequent in recent years. </p>
<p>Washington’s support for Taiwan </p>
<p>While Beijing and Washington have taken steps in recent months to
resume high-level exchanges and stabilize bilateral relations, tensions
around the issue of Taiwan remain high. </p>
<p>According to CGTN, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi told U.S.
National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan during their meeting in
Washington D.C. last month that “Taiwan independence,” as the Chinese
state-run TV channel  put it, is “the most severe threat to peace and
stability in the Taiwan Strait, which must be resolutely opposed and
reflected in concrete policies and actions.”</p>
<p>Apart from the stern warning from Wang, a top Chinese military
official also reiterated Beijing’s determination to quash any attempt to
separate Taiwan from China. </p>
<p>General Zhang Youxia,vice chairman of China’s Central Military
Commission, said late last month during China’s biggest annual military
diplomacy event — the 10th Xiangshan Forum in Beijing — that “no matter
who wants to separate Taiwan from China in any form, the Chinese
military will never agree and will show no mercy.”</p>
<p>In addition to warning against attempts to separate Taiwan from
China, Zhang also issued a veiled criticism of the U.S. and its allies,
accusing “some countries” of trying to undermine the Chinese
government. </p>
<p>Some experts say the Chinese government’s main concern is
Washington’s increased support and involvement in Taiwan. </p>
<p>“It raises questions about whether the U.S. remains committed to what
has been their One China Policy, which is essentially that the process
by which the two sides [of the Taiwan Strait] figure out their
differences has to be peaceful,” Amanda Hsiao, a senior China analyst
for the International Crisis Group (ICG), told VOA in a phone
interview. </p>
<p>She said Washington’s continuous political and military support for
Taiwan increases Beijing’s concern that the U.S. may try to “keep Taiwan
permanently separated” from China. </p>
<p>While China has repeatedly cited Taiwan independence as its red line,
the Hoover Institution’s Templeman said Beijing’s latest comments are in
line with what it has stated in the past. </p>
<p>“I haven’t seen anything that suggests there is a new tone or
rhetoric,” he told VOA, adding that this means there is no sign of
significant escalation in Beijing’s level of concern. </p>
<p>“Nobody is talking about a deadline for unification or China is going
to resolve the Taiwan question sooner rather than later. Those would be
a significant escalation from what they have said in the past,”
Templeman said. </p>
<p>Tilting the status quo </p>
<p>Compared to stern warnings from Beijing, the U.S. has repeated the
importance of maintaining the status quo across the Taiwan Strait during
meetings between high-level officials from the two sides. </p>
<p>According to the White House’s readout of  Sullivan’s meeting with
Wang, Sullivan “discussed concerns over China’s dangerous and unlawful
actions in the South China Sea” and “raised the importance of peace and
stability across the Taiwan Strait.”</p>
<p>Some analysts say the U.S. is trying to maintain the status quo
across the Taiwan Strait while “implicitly signaling” that it is China,
not Taiwan, that is shifting the status quo.</p>
<p>“Comments from the U.S. certainly repeat the type of rhetoric we have
seen before,” Timothy Rich, a professor of political science at Western
Kentucky University, told VOA in a written response. </p>
<p>Despite efforts to ease tensions, the U.S. and China remain critical
of each other’s military activities near Taiwan. On November 1, the U.S.
7th Fleet announced that a U.S. guided-missile destroyer, the USS Rafael
Peralta, and a Canadian frigate, HMCS Ottawa, “conducted a routine
Taiwan Strait transit.” </p>
<p>Beijing accused Washington of hyping the transit, and it deployed
warships and aircraft to follow the American and Canadian vessels.
Senior Colonel Shi Yi, the spokesperson for the People’s Liberation
Army’s Eastern Theater Command, said the Chinese military’s actions were
in accordance with laws and regulations. </p>
<p>Western Kentucky University’s Rich said he doesn’t expect the
tensions between the U.S. and China over Taiwan, or the two sides’
military actions, “to dissipate in the near future.” </p>
<p>“I would expect Chinese officials to continue to place the blame on
the U.S. and to frame their own actions in the Taiwan Strait as a
domestic issue,” he told VOA. </p>
<p>Since their fundamental differences over Taiwan currently seem
unresolvable, and given that both sides have many issues they want to
prioritize, Templeman thinks the U.S. and China may not give Taiwan a
significant focus during the Biden-Xi meeting at APEC. </p>
<p>“Both sides will need to talk about Taiwan at some point during the
meeting, but I would expect it to be pretty formulaic,” he told
VOA. </p>
<p>In Templeman’s view, if Taiwan is only a small part of the Biden-Xi
meeting, that could serve both Biden’s and Xi’s interests.</p>

<h2 id="at-g7-blinken-warns-israel-against-occupying-gaza">At G7,
Blinken Warns Israel Against Occupying Gaza</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Israel against
reoccupying Gaza, even while acknowledging a “transition period” may be
necessary following Israel’s war against Hamas militants in the
Palestinian enclave. </p>
<p>At a press conference Wednesday on the sidelines of a Group of Seven
summit in Tokyo, Blinken reasserted U.S. support for Israel’s efforts to
oust Hamas, which killed 1,400 people and abducted over 200 others in an
attack last month in Israel. </p>
<p>But Blinken also said “it is clear that Israel cannot occupy
Gaza.” </p>
<p>“Now, the reality is that there may be a need for some transition
period at the end of the conflict. But it is imperative that the
Palestinian people be central to governance in Gaza and the West Bank,
as well,” he added. </p>
<p>In an interview Tuesday with ABC News, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu suggested his country will play a security role in
Gaza for an “indefinite period” once the conflict ends. </p>
<p>Over 10,000 Palestinians have been killed, including over 4,000
children, according to Palestinian officials, as Israel intensifies its
ground operation and airstrikes in Gaza.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has insisted there will be no cease-fire until the hostages
taken by Hamas are released. But he suggested Tuesday that “tactical
little pauses – an hour there, an hour there” are possible. </p>
<p>In a joint statement issued Wednesday, G7 foreign ministers called
for “humanitarian pauses and corridors” to allow for the delivery of
humanitarian aid and the release of hostages. </p>
<p>The G7 statement also vowed to support Ukraine’s defense against
Russia “for as long as it takes,” condemned alleged Russian-North Korean
weapons transactions, and criticized a wide range of Chinese
actions.</p>
<p>Mideast focus</p>
<p>But the meeting was dominated by the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, amid
growing international calls for a cease-fire.</p>
<p>Last week, a large majority of countries in the United Nations
General Assembly voted for a resolution calling for an immediate and
sustained “humanitarian truce” in Gaza. </p>
<p>The United States voted against the proposal, warning that a
cease-fire would allow Hamas to regroup and conduct more attacks. </p>
<p>France, another G7 member, supported the resolution, underscoring
differences on the Mideast conflict even among wealthy, developed
countries. </p>
<p>G7 host Japan has also not been as outspokenly pro-Israel as other
U.S. allies, said Jeffrey J. Hall, a professor at the Kanda University
of International Studies.</p>
<p>“Japan is faced with either angering Washington, or angering the Arab
states that supply it with oil,” Hall said.</p>
<p>“It’s not really possible for the G7 to come out with a very strong
united position on this,” he added. </p>
<p>At his press conference, Blinken played down any suggestion of
friction, saying “G7 unity is stronger and more important than
ever.” </p>
<p>Pressing global concerns</p>
<p>In the joint statement that followed two days of meetings, G7 foreign
ministers addressed a wide range of other global issues. </p>
<p>On Ukraine, the G7 leaders vowed that their governments’ “steadfast
commitment” to Ukraine’s defense “will never waver.” </p>
<p>“We commit to standing by Ukraine for as long as it takes,” the
statement said. </p>
<p>Some analysts have expressed concern that the Israel-Gaza conflict
may shift international focus away from the Ukraine-Russia war.</p>
<p>Such concerns are valid, according to Sebastian Maslow, who teaches
international relations at Sendai Shirayuri Women’s College in
Japan. </p>
<p>“We are living in an attention economy now,” Maslow said.  But, he
said, G7 governments know that if they soften their support of Ukraine,
“this will send a strong signal towards Russia – and China, for that
matter – that the G7 has no ability to resolve a fundamental regional
crisis.”</p>
<p>Focus on Asia</p>
<p>In Tokyo, Blinken also stressed it is important for the United States
to continue to focus on Asia, even while it deals with urgent issues in
Europe and the Mideast.</p>
<p>“We are determined, and we are, as we would say, running and chewing
gum at the same time,” Blinken said. “The Indo-Pacific is the critical
region for our future.” </p>
<p>His comments come ahead of an expected meeting next week in
California between U.S. President Joe Biden and China’s top leader, Xi
Jinping. </p>
<p>Blinken said he could not comment on specific topics that Biden and
Xi will discuss, but that both sides “have acknowledged the importance
of leader level channels in managing the relationship.” </p>
<p>Analysts do not expect any breakthroughs at the Xi-Biden meeting but
say such meetings may help prevent U.S.-China tensions from spiraling
out of control. </p>
<p>Wednesday’s G7 statement repeated many longstanding concerns that the
United States and many of its allies have about China.</p>
<p>The statement expressed opposition to “unilateral attempts to change
the status quo by force or coercion” in the East and South China
seas. </p>
<p>The statement also linked the peace and stability of the Taiwan
Strait to the “security and prosperity” of the international
community.</p>
<p>China has increased its military threats against self-ruled Taiwan
and refuses to rule out taking the island by force. Beijing views the
issue as a domestic, not international, concern, and routinely
criticizes other countries’ comments on the matter.</p>
<p>In addition, the G7 statement expressed concern about the human
rights situation in China, including in Xinjiang and Tibet. </p>
<p>But G7 leaders added: “We stand prepared to build constructive and
stable relations with China, recognizing the importance of engaging
candidly and expressing our concerns directly to China.” </p>
<p>Blinken to Seoul</p>
<p>Following the G7 meetings, Blinken departed for Seoul, where he will
meet with senior South Korean leaders. Military cooperation between
North Korea and Russia will be high on the agenda, according to U.S.
officials.</p>
<p>Washington and Seoul have vowed to enhance joint deterrence against
growing threats from Pyongyang as North Korea continues its nuclear and
ballistic missile programs and prepares for what would be a third
attempt to launch a spy satellite.</p>
<p>The G7 statement strongly condemned recent North Korean weapons
tests, as well as alleged arms transfers from North Korea to Russia,
which it said directly violate U.N. Security Council resolutions.</p>

on the vine – why wine production is falling</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
From the BBC World Service: Wine production around the world is set to
fall this year to its lowest level in more than 60 years, mainly down to
changes in the weather. Plus, consumer and environmental groups have
issued a legal complaint to the European Commission, saying that Danone,
Nestle and Coca Cola are making misleading claims about plastic bottles
being 100% recycled – or being completely recyclable. The big brands
deny this. And, El Salvador made history in 2021 by becoming the first
country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, but how has it worked out for
ordinary Salvadoreans?

<em>This is an excerpt from a longer paper. You can read the whole thing

Our message is simple: it is possible to get the best of both worlds. We
can and should get the benefits of the cloud while taking security back
into our own hands. Here we outline a strategy for doing that.

<h3>
What Is Decoupling?
</h3>
<p>
In the last few years, a slew of ideas old and new have converged to
reveal a path out of this morass, but they haven’t been widely
recognized, combined, or used. These ideas, which we’ll refer to in the
aggregate as “decoupling,” allow us to rethink both security and
privacy…

id="ivanka-trump-says-at-ny-fraud-trial-she-doesnt-recall-deal-details">Ivanka
Trump Says at NY Fraud Trial She Doesn’t Recall Deal Details</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump testified on Wednesday that she
did not recall details of real-estate deals she worked on at her
father’s company, in a New York civil fraud trial that threatens the
former U.S. president’s business empire.  </p>
<p>Like her brothers Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, who testified last
week, Ivanka Trump sought to distance herself from the questionable
valuation methods that have already been ruled fraudulent by the judge
overseeing the trial.</p>
<p>Trump, by contrast, has acknowledged on the witness stand that some
of the estimates of golf courses, office towers and other company assets
were inaccurate.</p>
<p>The lawsuit by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat,
accuses Trump and his family businesses of manipulating real estate
asset values to dupe lenders and insurers and embellish Trump’s
reputation as a successful businessman.</p>
<p>Unlike her siblings and father, Ivanka Trump is not a defendant in
the case.</p>
<p>As a top executive at the Trump Organization between 2011 and 2017,
Ivanka said she focused on redeveloping the Doral golf course in Florida
and the Old Post Office property in Washington.</p>
<p>At the trial, she was shown a 2011 email in which she acknowledged
that a requirement by lender Deutsche Bank that her father maintain a
net worth of at least $3 billion was a problem but encouraged company
officials to approve it anyway.</p>
<p>“We wanted to get a great rate and the only way to get proceeds/term
and principal where we want them is to guarantee the deal,” she wrote to
a Trump Organization lawyer.</p>
<p>On the witness stand, she said she favored the deal but did not
recall specific terms. “I felt generally that the deal terms with
Deutsche Bank for Doral were positive,” she said.</p>
<p>Trump, who leads his rivals for the 2024 Republican presidential
nomination despite a maelstrom of legal troubles, has denied wrongdoing
and accused James and Justice Arthur Engoron of political bias and
“election interference.” He repeated those claims on social media late
on Tuesday, saying it was “Sad!” that Ivanka was being forced to
testify.</p>
<p>During defiant and rambling testimony on Monday, Trump acknowledged
that valuations for his properties were not always accurate but said the
errors were not relevant to the financial institutions that used them to
price deals.  </p>
<p>Donald Jr. and Eric Trump testified last week that the financial
documents at the heart of the case were not their responsibility, though
emails and other documents showed they may have been more involved than
their testimony indicated.  </p>
<p>Ivanka joined her father during his 2017-2021 term in the White
House, leaving her brothers in charge of the company during that time.
 </p>
<p>James said Ivanka nevertheless was involved in manipulating property
values.  </p>
<p>“She will attempt today to distance herself from the company, but
unfortunately the facts will reveal that in fact she was very much
involved,” James said on the courthouse steps.</p>
<p>In a ruling that found Trump, his adult sons and 10 of his companies
liable for fraud, Engoron described in scathing terms how the defendants
made up valuations. His ruling could strip Trump’s control of some of
his best known properties, though that order is on hold during
appeal.</p>
<p>James is seeking $250 million in fines, as well as restrictions that
would prevent Trump and his adult sons from doing business in New
York.</p>
<p>In addition to this case, Trump is a defendant in four separate
criminal cases, including two stemming from his attempts to overturn
Democrat Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential election victory.  </p>
<p>Nevertheless, opinion polls show he holds a commanding lead over
Republican rivals to face Biden next year.</p>

Voters Approve Abortion Rights Protections, Democrats Grab Control of
Virginia Legislature</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A year away from the country’s next presidential election, Democrats
and abortion rights advocates won a series of victories in elections in
several U.S. states Tuesday.</p>
<p>Voters in the state of Ohio approved a constitutional amendment
guaranteeing access to abortion and other forms of reproductive health
care.</p>
<p>The measure follows the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision last year to
overturn the 1972 Roe v. Wade decision that had protected abortion
rights.</p>
<p>Ohio was one of several states where an abortion ban went into effect
as a result of the court’s decision.</p>
<p>Before Ohio, voters in several other states, including California,
Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana and Vermont, adopted initiatives to
protect abortion access following the Supreme Court ruling last
year.</p>
<p>In Kentucky, Democratic Governor Andy Beshear won re-election Tuesday
after a campaign that included advocating for exceptions to the state’s
near-total abortion ban.</p>
<p>Voters in Virginia denied Republican Governor Glen Youngkin’s hope of
putting the state’s legislature in his party’s control. Democrats held
onto a slim majority in the state Senate while taking back a majority in
the House of Delegates.</p>
<p>Youngkin has proposed instituting a 15-week abortion ban in Virginia
except in cases of rape, incest or if the life of the mother is at risk.
 A Democratic majority in the legislature will block that effort.</p>
<p>Republicans did score a win Tuesday in the state of Mississippi,
where Governor Tate Reeves defeated Democrat Brandon Presley to earn a
second term in office.</p>
<p>November 2024 will feature a much bigger slate of national and state
elections, led by races for the U.S. president, all 435 seats in the
U.S. House of Representatives and new terms for 33 seats in the U.S.
Senate.  </p>
<p>There will also be special elections to finish the final years of
Senate terms for two seats, one left vacant by the death of Democrat
Dianne Feinstein and the other by Republican Ben Sasse’s resignation to
become a university president.</p>
<p>Democrats currently hold a narrow majority in the Senate, while
Republicans have a small majority in the House.</p>
<p>Eleven states will hold elections for governor in 2024, while voters
in most of the 50 states will cast ballots in legislative races.</p>

House Votes to Censure Rep. Tlaib Over Her Israel-Hamas Rhetoric in
Stunning Rebuke</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The House voted late Tuesday to censure Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib
of Michigan — the only Palestinian American in Congress — an
extraordinary rebuke of her rhetoric about the Israel-Hamas war.</p>
<p>The 234-188 tally came after enough Democrats joined with Republicans
to censure Tlaib, a punishment one step below expulsion from the House.
The three-term congresswoman has long been a target of criticism for her
views on the decades-long conflict in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The debate on the censure resolution on Tuesday afternoon was
emotional and intense. Republican Rep. Rich McCormick of Georgia pushed
the measure in response to what he called Tlaib’s promotion of
antisemitic rhetoric. He said she has “levied unbelievable falsehoods
about our greatest ally, Israel, and the attack on October 7.”</p>
<p>With other Democrats standing by her side, Tlaib defended her stance,
saying she “will not be silenced and I will not let you distort my
words.”</p>
<p>She added that her criticism of the Jewish state has always been
directed toward its government and its leadership under Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>“It is important to separate people and government,” she said. “The
idea that criticizing the government of Israel is antisemitic sets a
very dangerous precedent. And it’s been used to silence diverse voices
speaking up for human rights across our nation.”</p>
<p>That criticism reached new heights after the Oct. 7 attack by the
terrorist group Hamas left hundreds of Israelis dead and scores injured.
Tlaib, who has family in the West Bank, came under heavy reproval after
she failed to immediately condemn Hamas after the attack.</p>
<p>All Democrats initially stood by Tlaib and helped defeat the first
censure resolution against her last week. But since then, many of her
colleagues, including prominent Jewish members, have become more
conflicted about her rhetoric about the war, especially because of a
slogan she has used frequently that is widely seen as calling for the
eradication of Israel.</p>
<p>Ultimately, more than 20 of them joined Republicans on Tuesday night
to censure her after an effort to shelve the measure failed earlier in
the day.</p>
<p>The latest censure push resulted in a dramatic vote on the House
floor amid political tensions over the ongoing, deadly Israel-Hamas
war.</p>
<p>While the majority of both parties have historically stood firmly on
the side of Israel, divisions have emerged in the Democratic Party about
the American response.</p>
<p>Rep. Brad Schneider, D-Ill., the lone Democrat to vote with
Republicans on Tuesday to advance the censure resolution, said he
believed it was important to debate the slogan “from the river to the
sea.”</p>
<p>“It is nothing else but the call for the destruction of Israel and
murder of Jews,” the Jewish Democrat said. “I will always defend the
right to free speech. Tlaib has the right to say whatever she
wants.”</p>
<p>He added, “But it cannot go unanswered.”</p>
<p>While the censure of a lawmaker carries no practical effect, it
amounts to severe reproach from colleagues, as lawmakers who are
censured are usually asked to stand in the well of the House as the
censure resolution against them is read aloud.</p>
<p>But the resolution against Tlaib did not call for the public
admonishment.</p>
<p>With the vote, Tlaib will become the second Muslim-American woman in
Congress to be formally admonished this year for her criticism of the
Jewish state.</p>
<p>Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., was removed in February from the House
Foreign Affairs Committee for similar comments she made about
Israel.</p>
<p>Some on the left have criticized President Joe Biden’s stance and
urged him to put conditions on U.S. support for Israel as its aggressive
military campaign drives the Palestinian death toll higher.</p>
<p>While the vote against Tlaib will take place against the
extraordinary backdrop of the war, the push to censure her is part of a
growing pattern in the House.</p>
<p>Censure had long been viewed as a punishment of last resort, just one
step below expulsion and to be triggered only for the most egregious
wrongdoing. But censure resolutions are quickly becoming routine in the
chamber, often wielded in strikingly partisan ways.</p>
<p>Many Democrats and some Republicans who opposed censuring Tlaib cited
free speech and warned of the precedent it would set.</p>
<p>“This resolution not only degrades our Constitution, but it cheapens
the meaning of discipline in this body for people who actually commit
wrongful actions like bribery, fraud, violent assault and so on,” said
Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., who defended Tlaib against the resolution on
the floor late Tuesday.</p>
<p>A second resolution by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., to censure
Tlaib had also been scheduled for a procedural vote late Tuesday night.
But that measure was put on hold after the censure resolution from
McCormick advanced to a final vote.</p>
<p>Tlaib is now the 26th person to ever be censured by the chamber, and
the second just this year. In June, Republicans voted to censure
Democrat Adam Schiff of California for comments he made several years
ago about investigations into then-President Donald Trump’s ties to
Russia.</p>
<p>When the House was under Democratic control, Republican Rep. Paul
Gosar of Arizona was censured in 2021 for tweeting an animated video
that depicted him striking Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of
New York with a sword. And Democratic Rep. Charlie Rangel of New York
was censured in 2010 over serious financial and campaign misconduct.</p>

<h2 id="maines-historic-public-power-push-goes-down-in-flames">Maine’s
Historic Public Power Push Goes Down in Flames</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDQyMTA3My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MTEzNjM4NH0.BG6veVWjAouLpSqZz5v_EJhBHUOt2ITHGI58iO9i6r8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p style>
An unprecedented “public power takeover” campaign in Maine failed on
Tuesday, according to a
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/11/07/us/elections/results-maine-question-3-create-pine-tree-power-co.html" target="_blank">projection
by <em>The New York Times</em></a>.<br/>
</p>
<p style>
The Maine ballot had asked voters if they wanted to create the Pine Tree
Power Company, a nonprofit electric utility governed by a
publicly-elected board, which would purchase and acquire all of the
investor-owned transmission and distribution utilities in Maine. When
the <em>Times</em> made its call, voters had rejected the initiative 71%
to 29%, with over a third of precincts reporting.
</p>
<p style>
The ballot question was the culmination of a multi-year campaign by a
group called Our Power, which initially brought the idea to a vote in
the Maine legislature in 2021. Though it passed, the bill was vetoed by
Governor Janet Mills, and supporters did not have the votes to override
the decision. Instead, they gathered the 63,000 signatures required to
put the question to Mainers on this year’s ballot.
</p>
<p style>
A growing contingent of the progressive climate movement is turning to
the idea of public power as a way to solve many aspects of the energy
transition at once. They argue that the system of providing electricity
through state-sanctioned private monopolies is incompatible with an era
of climate change, when utilities should be rapidly transitioning to
clean energy, while also growing and hardening the grid, and easing the
cost burden for the most vulnerable customers. The theory is that a
public utility, unencumbered by the need to turn a profit, will be able
to prioritize other public goals.
</p>
<p style>
Public power advocates in Maine offered voters a laundry list of other
reasons why they thought the state’s two investor-owned utilities, CMP
and Versant, should be replaced. Though it’s rare that anyone likes
their utilities, CMP and Versant are consistently rated the
<a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2022-electric-utility-residential-customer-satisfaction-study" target="_blank">worst
for customer satisfaction</a> in the Northeast. CMP has faced multiple
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/a05f3fefce7f945f30a2e9d320302cbf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">investigations
and fines</a> over its billing system, customer service, and
<a href="https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2022/01/14/maine-utility-admits-solar-interconnection-faults-hiring-consultants/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">delays
connecting new solar projects</a> to the grid. Advocates also appealed
to nationalist views by highlighting the fact that both companies have
“foreign owners.” (CMP is owned by Iberdrola, a Spanish company. Versant
is owned by Enmax, a Canadian company owned by the city of Calgary.)
</p>
<p style>
But in the run-up to the vote, the two utilities spent millions of
dollars running targeted ads on social media and streaming services
calling the idea “too costly and too risky.” This “disaster for Maine”
would “hurt workers and small businesses,” they argued.
</p>
<p style>
A few key aspects of the takeover were uncertain, including the ultimate
cost of the acquisition, how long it would take to complete, and whether
the transition would result in lower rates for customers. Campaigners
essentially asked Mainers to take a leap of faith. They managed to
convince the city of Portland, but few other parts of the state appeared
to get on board.
</p>
<p style>
This was perhaps the most ambitious attempt at a public power takeover
the nation has seen since the early 20th century. But other, similar
efforts are underway in cities and towns all over the country, like Ann
Arbor, Michigan, and San Diego, California.

<h2 id="china-makes-largest-us-soy-purchases-in-months-traders">China
Makes Largest US Soy Purchases in Months: Traders</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>China booked its largest single-day U.S. soybean purchases in at
least three months on Tuesday, traders said, offering a glimmer of hope
for the most valuable U.S. farm export after overseas sales of the 2023
harvest had fallen well behind the normal pace.</p>
<p>Chinese importers bought around 10 cargoes of soybeans, or about
600,000 metric tons, for shipment from Gulf Coast and Pacific Northwest
export terminals between December and March, trade sources said.</p>
<p>The sales would be a relief to U.S. farmers, who have seen Brazil
dominate the global export market for soy as well as corn for longer
than normal this year.</p>
<p>If confirmed, Tuesday’s sales would be the largest single-day soybean
purchases by the world’s top soy importer since late July, according to
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) daily sales data.</p>
<p>They were the latest in a series of soy import deals since late last
week by Sinograin, China’s state-owned importer, according to three
export traders with knowledge of the deals. Total purchases over that
time were estimated at as much as 20 to 25 cargoes, two traders
said.</p>
<p>Cash premiums for U.S. soybeans at Gulf Coast terminals GRYM, GRZD
jumped by as much as 10 cents a bushel on Tuesday as exporters scrambled
to source supplies, traders said.</p>
<p>High U.S. prices due to barge shipping disruptions and stiff export
market competition from Brazil, which harvested a record soy crop this
year, have hampered U.S. sales in the season so far.</p>
<p>Confirmed sales to China as of late October were down 35% from a year
ago, and sales to all destinations were down 28%. The USDA is currently
projecting a 12% year-on-year export decline.</p>
<p>But U.S. prices have become more competitive for shipments from
December through March, when Brazil’s next harvest will be
available.</p>
<p>The USDA has confirmed private sales totaling 236,000 metric tons of
U.S. soybeans over the past two days via the agency’s daily reporting
system. Traders expect additional “flash sales” following the deals on
Tuesday.</p>

<h2 id="us-nato-follow-russia-in-dropping-out-of-europe-arms-treaty">US,
NATO Follow Russia in Dropping Out of Europe Arms Treaty</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington and NATO allies said Tuesday they will echo Russia’s
suspension of a Cold War treaty to limit conventional arms proliferation
in Europe, with the White House saying it had “no option” but to leave.
 </p>
<p>Nonproliferation advocates said this won’t make a huge impact on the
battlefield.</p>
<p>Suspending the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE)
“will strengthen the [NATO] Alliance’s deterrence and defense capacity
by removing restrictions that impact planning, deployments, and
exercises — restrictions that no longer bind Russia after Moscow’s
withdrawal,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a
statement.  </p>
<p>Treaty set limits</p>
<p>The 1990 treaty was designed to prevent either side of the post-Cold
War power structure — at the time, NATO and the former Soviet Warsaw
Pact — from being able to amass forces for a flash offensive. </p>
<p>It also set equal limits on the number of tanks, armored combat
vehicles, heavy artillery, combat aircraft and attack helicopters it
applied in the territory between the Atlantic Ocean and the Ural
Mountains. </p>
<p>John Kirby, director of strategic communications for the National
Security Council, said the U.S. had no better option but to pull out.
 </p>
<p>“I don’t know how we could justify not pulling out of it, given that
the Russians have decided unilaterally to just throw it in the trash
heap,” he said. “They left the United States and our NATO allies with no
choice but to cease our accommodations and compliance with the treaty,
as well.” </p>
<p>VOA asked if this decision could lead to NATO allies increasing the
footprint of conventional weapons in Ukraine.  </p>
<p>“As for future force posture, I certainly won’t talk about that from
this podium,” he said.  </p>
<p>NATO, which had criticized Russia’s June announcement to pull out,
defended its decision to do the same. In a statement, the 31-member
security alliance said they all support suspending their participation
“for as long as necessary.” </p>
<p>“Russia’s withdrawal is the latest in a series of actions that
systematically undermines Euro-Atlantic security,” NATO said in a
statement. “Russia continues to demonstrate disregard for arms control,
including key principles of reciprocity, transparency, compliance,
verification, and host nation consent, and undermines the rules-based
international order. While recognizing the role of the CFE as a
cornerstone of the Euro-Atlantic security architecture, a situation
whereby Allied States Parties abide by the Treaty, while Russia does
not, would be unsustainable.” </p>
<p>“The Treaty’s core objective, namely to ensure a balanced
conventional forces potential in Europe, cannot be achieved without
Russia,” Germany’s government said in a Tuesday statement explaining its
decision.  </p>
<p>Russia calls treaty ‘vestige of the past’</p>
<p>Russia gave its 150-day notice of withdrawal in June, arguing that
the treaty, forged in the ashes of the Cold War, was obsolete. It also
said the “last straw” for the decision was NATO’s decision to welcome
Finland and Sweden — both nonsignatories to the treaty — into the pact.
Finland borders Russia, and Moscow expressed concerns that it could be
used by third countries to amass weapons along Russia’s northwestern
border. </p>
<p>“It is clear that, in today’s conditions, the CFE has definitely
become a vestige of the past,” the Russian government said in a
statement. “Our opponents should not have any illusions about Russia
returning to the CFE compliance.” </p>
<p>Both U.S. parties agree on suspension</p>
<p>The U.S. decision was applauded by both parties, said U.S. Senators
Ben Cardin, a Democrat, and Jim Risch, a Republican. Both sit on the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee. </p>
<p>“This is an opportunity to reassess our force posture in Europe to
ensure we are ready to deter any Russian threats against U.S. national
security interests, including against our NATO allies and other regional
partners,” they said in a joint statement.  </p>
<p>But security and nonproliferation experts say this won’t make much
difference.  </p>
<p>“Russia stopped implementing the CFE treaty way back around 2007,”
John Erath, senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control and
Non-Proliferation, told VOA. “So, the implications are pretty much zero.
… The treaty has been dead for many years, and this is just further
acknowledgment that it is so.” </p>
<p>Pal Dunay, a professor of NATO and European security issues at the
George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies, agreed in an
analysis he wrote when Russia issued its decision.  </p>
<p>“Russia’s decision to formally withdraw from the CFE Treaty will not
make much difference on the ground,” he wrote.    </p>
<p>But, Erath noted, one important thing will now change: Under the
treaty, signatories were required to send each other annual reports with
detailed information on their conventional forces. Russia, he said, did
not comply with that requirement, but was receiving the information from
the other signatories.</p>

desktop flavors featuring KDE Plasma Desktop, Xfce, Cinnamon, and more.
As with every Fedora release, it comes with the latest and greatest
every one of the Linux desktops has to offer, as well as all the newest
versions of the various frameworks and underlying layers, down to the
kernel. Fedora KDE is my desktop of choice, so I’m definitely a bit

Very exciting news! Dave Dunfield has decided to release the source code
of over 40 years’ work “in the hopes that others may find it useful or
maybe learn a few things.” This includes the Micro-C compiler, a very
nice C compiler for DOS. You can find everything at
<a class="" href="https://dunfield.themindfactory.com/dnldsrc.htm" rel="nofollow">Source
Code Downloads</a> on Dave’s website. The
<a class="" href="https://dunfield.themindfactory.com/dnld/sc/COPY.TXT" rel="nofollow">source
code license</a> isn’t an “OSI open source” license, but aims to release
the source code for others to use. Thanks Dave!
