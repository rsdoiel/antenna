<h2 id="start-now-dont-wait">Start now, don’t wait</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Start now, don’t wait
</h1>
<p>
If I had young people ask me for advice (which they aren’t and when I
was young I also didn’t) I’d say this: The world is designed to keep you
docile and distracted. If you want to do adventurous things, risk
things, go far, you must do it now. If you wait, you will be too late.
</p>
<p>
Everybody going on adventure everywhere is ill prepared. There fact that
you cannot prepare is what makes it an adventure. Great things were done
by people who were ill prepared.
</p>
<p>
It’s true for sports, for your career, for politics. If you wait until
the time is right, all the people who got started when the time was not
right will have made the decisions for you.
</p>
<p>
The same is true for any kind of change. People like me tell you that
we’ve got this but we don’t – and by the time you realize that everybody
is fumbling and improvising, and when you finally learn how important it
is to network and to be sly, how nobody who gets anything done just
speaks the truth, when you realize that just because you are right
people aren’t going to change their opinions, when you realize that to
make changes you need to be politically active, to organize, even though
you won’t learn how to do this in school because school prepares you for
the world that is, for the system that upholds it, not the better world
that is possible because it isn’t tried and true and nobody is financing
that, then you’ll be as old as me and still won’t have done a thing.
</p>
<p>
Sure, it’s never too late but if you get started early, there’s still
time.
</p>
<p>
And if instead you think, old man, I have done all that and more, what
are you talking about? Then I am relieved and my fears are unfounded.
Thank you!

<p>
No, we’re not talking about three of Snow White’s seven dwarfs — we’re
talking about the mood of the American consumer. Despite low levels of
unemployment, solid GDP growth and cooling inflation, Americans remain
pretty darn sour on the economy. What gives? Plus, China is sanctioning
five American defense contractors, and a massive new train line in
Mexico is stirring controversy among environmentalists.

AMD’s Ryzen 8040 “Hawk Point” series mobile processors are very similar
to the company’s previous-gen Ryzen 7040 “Phoenix” series when it comes
to CPU and GPU technology, core counts, and frequencies. The biggest
difference is that the new chips have a neural processing unit that’s
60% faster, enabling better support for on-device AI processing. But […]

<p>I would like to give a LLM a pointer to a folder of my writing and
say “learn this” and then a few hours or days later I’d be able to ask
it questions about what I wrote. I also have folders of stuff my parents
wrote. It would be kind of interesting to feed those into a LLM and then
ask questions about them. Could be the equivalent of ten years of

<em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Insurance agents and analysts tell the
paper that, rather than face public backlash from officially abandoning
states like Florida or California, carriers are resorting to more subtle
– but equally effective – tactics to “choke off” new business. These
include closing local offices or making it difficult for homeowners to
even get a quote unless they fight through layers of red tape. “Most of
the carriers have just flat out said, we are not accepting new business
right now [in California]. But that statement is made to insurance
agencies, not the public,” says Timothy Gaspar, head of a Los
Angeles-based insurance agency. “Or they’re making it next to impossible
to get a new policy.”

from the <em>Financial Times</em> finds shipowners are resisting growing
pressure to order newer, greener vessels and decarbonize the sector,
opting instead to hold on to older ships. The average age of the global
container shipping fleet is now 14.3 years, and the average age of
tankers is 12.9 years. Why are owners keeping their aging vessels? One
reason is they’re not confident in the availability of new energy
sources like green fuel. Another is the soaring resale value of
second-hand ships, which are being bought up by a “shadow fleet”
transporting Russian oil. The United Nations International Maritime
Organization (IMO) recently set a 2050 net zero target for global
shipping, but no legally binding measures have been set to facilitate
the goal. International shipping

<li>Researchers want to use seawater to ‘refreeze’ Arctic ice

<strong></strong>This week a team of British researchers will embark on
a mission to learn if pumping seawater on top of sea ice can “refreeze”
the Arctic,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=7947ee2ba1&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a>
the <em>Times</em> of London. As global temperatures rise, sea ice is
rapidly shrinking, decimating habitats for wildlife and exacerbating a
global warming feedback loop: Less ice means more water to absorb the
sun’s energy. The scientists plan to cut a hole in the ice and pump
seawater on top of it, which they hope will freeze, “speeding up the
natural freezing process underneath the ice,” the <em>Times</em>
explains.

There are some big unknowns, one being whether using salty seawater
could actually make the melting worse. Another is whether powering the
project could even be feasible. This particular trial is being powered
by a hydrogen fuel cell, but reversing ice loss trends would require
about 10 million pumps. As one researcher put it: “That’s a lot of
pumps.” This is one of several engineering methods being floated as
potential solutions to the rapidly worsening sea ice problem, the
<em>Times</em> reports. Another wild idea is to sprinkle glass powder on
the ice to reflect the sun’s rays.

Interdisciplinary Workshop on Reimagining Democracy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, updated: 2024-01-08, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Last month, I convened the Second Interdisciplinary Workshop on
Reimagining Democracy
(<a href="https://www.schneier.com/iword/2023/">IWORD 2023</a>) at the
Harvard Kennedy School Ash Center. As with
<a href="https://www.schneier.com/iword/2022/">IWORD 2022</a>, the goal
was to bring together a diverse set of thinkers and practitioners to
talk about how democracy might be reimagined for the twenty-first
century.
</p>
<p>
My thinking is very broad here. Modern democracy was invented in the
mid-eighteenth century, using mid-eighteenth-century technology. Were
democracy to be invented from scratch today, with today’s technologies,
it would look very different. Representation would look different.
Adjudication would look different. Resource allocation and reallocation
would look different. Everything would look different, because we would
have much more powerful technology to build on and no legacy systems to
worry about…

Investigators Recover Key Part From Alaska Airlines 737 MAX Jet</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said late
on Sunday the “key missing component” from the Boeing 737 MAX 9 jet
involved in an Alaska Airlines emergency landing had been recovered from
the backyard of a suburban home.</p>
<p>The plug door tore off the left side of an Alaska Airlines jet on
Friday following takeoff from Portland, Oregon, en route to Ontario,
California, depressurizing the plane and forcing pilots to turn back and
land safely with all 171 passengers and six crew on board.</p>
<p>The Federal Aviation Administration on Saturday ordered the temporary
grounding of 171 Boeing MAX 9 jets installed with the same panel, which
weighs about 27 kg and covers an optional exit door mainly used by
low-cost airlines.</p>
<p>The missing plug door was recovered on Sunday by a Portland school
teacher identified only as “Bob” in the Cedar Hills neighborhood who
found it in his backyard, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said, saying she
was “very relieved” it had been found.</p>
<p>She had earlier told reporters the aircraft part was a “key missing
component” to determine why the accident occurred.</p>
<p>“Our structures team will want to look at everything on the door -
all of the components on the door to see to look at witness marks, to
look at any paint transfer, what shape the door was in when found. That
can tell them a lot about what occurred,” she said.</p>
<p>The force from the loss of the plug door was strong enough to blow
open the cockpit door during flight, said Homendy, who said it must have
been a “terrifying event” to experience.</p>
<p>“They heard a bang,” Homendy said of the pilots, who were interviewed
by investigators.</p>
<p>A quick reference laminated checklist flew out the door, while the
first officer lost her headset, she said. “Communication was a serious
issue… It was described as chaos.”</p>
<p>Homendy said the cockpit voice recorder did not capture any data
because it had been overwritten and again called on regulators to
mandate retrofitting existing planes with recorders that capture 25
hours of data, up from the two hours required at present.</p>
<p>Earlier pressurization issues</p>
<p>Homendy said the auto pressurization fail light illuminated on the
same Alaska Airlines aircraft on Dec. 7, Jan. 3 and Jan. 4, but it was
unclear if there was any connection between those incidents and the
accident.</p>
<p>Alaska Airlines made a decision after the warnings to restrict the
aircraft from making long flights over water to Hawaii so that it could
return quickly to an airport if needed, Homendy said.</p>
<p>The Seattle-based carrier said earlier in response to questions about
the warning lights that aircraft pressurization system write-ups were
typical in commercial aviation operations with large planes.</p>
<p>The airline said, “in every case, the write up was fully evaluated
and resolved per approved maintenance procedures and in full compliance
with all applicable FAA regulations.”</p>
<p>Alaska Airlines added it has an internal policy to restrict aircraft
with multiple maintenance write-ups on some systems from long flights
over water that was not required by the FAA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Planes grounded</p>
<p>The FAA said on Sunday the affected fleet of Boeing MAX 9 planes,
including those operated by other carriers such as United Airlines,
would remain grounded until the regulator was satisfied they were
safe.</p>
<p>The FAA initially said on Saturday the required inspections would
take four to eight hours, leading many in the industry to assume the
planes could very quickly return to service.</p>
<p>But criteria for the checks have yet to be agreed between the FAA and
Boeing, meaning airlines have yet to receive detailed instructions,
people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>The FAA must approve Boeing’s inspection criteria before the checks
can be completed and planes can resume flights. Alaska Airlines said
late on Sunday it had still not received instructions from Boeing.</p>
<p>Alaska Airlines canceled 170 flights on Sunday and a further 60 on
Monday and said travel disruptions from the grounding were expected to
last through at least midweek. United, which has grounded its 79 MAX 9s,
canceled 230 flights on Sunday, or 8% of scheduled departures.</p>
<p>The accident has put Boeing back under scrutiny as it awaits
certification of its smaller MAX 7 as well as the larger MAX 10, which
is needed to compete with a key Airbus model.</p>
<p>In 2019, global authorities subjected all MAX planes to a wider
grounding that lasted 20 months after crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia
linked to poorly designed cockpit software killed a total of 346
people.</p>

Dominates Golden Globes, ‘Poor Things’ Upsets ‘Barbie’ in Comedy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEVERLY HILLS, California — “Oppenheimer has dominated the Golden
Globe Awards, taking home the night’s top honor. Yorgos Lanthimos’”Poor
Things” has won best comedy or musical at the 81st Golden Globes, an
upset victory over the category favorite, “Barbie.” </p>
<p>Emma Stone also won for her performance in “Poor Things.”</p>
<p>On the television side, “Succession” and “The Bear” are took multiple
honors. Christopher Nolan’s epic American drama “Oppenheimer” picked up
five big awards including best drama film, best director for Nolan, best
actor for Cillian Murphy, best supporting actor for Robert Downey
Jr. and for Ludwig Göransson’s score.</p>
<p>Paul Giamatti and Da’Vine Joy Randolph both won for their
performances in “The Holdovers.”</p>
<p>Christopher Nolan’s blockbuster biopic “Oppenheimer” dominated the
81st Golden Globes, winning five awards including best drama, while
Yorgos Lanthimos’ Frankenstein riff “Poor Things” pulled off an upset
victor over “Barbie” to triumph in the best comedy or musical
category.</p>
<p>If awards season has been building toward a second match-up of
Barbenheimer, this round went to “Oppenheimer.”</p>
<p>The film also won best director for Nolan, best drama actor for
Cillian Murphy, best supporting actor for Robert Downey Jr. and for
Ludwig Göransson’s score.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it was a no-brainer by any stretch of the imagination
to make a three-hour talky movie — R-rated by the way — about one of the
darkest developments in our history,” said producer Emma Thomas
accepting the night’s final award and thanking Universal chief Donna
Langley.</p>
<p>Along with best comedy or musical, “Poor Things” also won for Emma
Stone’s performance as Bella, a Victorian-era woman experiencing a
surreal sexual awakening.</p>
<p>“I see this as a rom-com,” said Stone. “But in the sense that Bella
falls in love with life itself, rather than a person.</p>
<p>She accepts the good and the bad in equal measure, and that really
made me look at life differently.”</p>
<p>Lily Gladstone won best actress in a dramatic film for Martin
Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon.” Gladstone, who began her speech
speaking the language of her native tribe, Blackfeet Nation, is the
first Indigenous winner in the category.</p>
<p>“This is a historic win,” said Gladstone. “It doesn’t just belong to
me.”</p>
<p>The Globes were in their ninth decade but facing a new and uncertain
chapter. After a tumultuous few years of scandal, the Hollywood Foreign
Press Association was dissolved, leaving a new Globes, on a new network
(CBS), to try to regain its perch as the third biggest award show of the
year, after the Oscars and Grammys. Even the menu (sushi from Nobu) was
remade.</p>
<p>“Golden Globes journalists, thank you for changing your game,
therefore changing your name,” said Downey in his acceptance speech.</p>
<p>It got off to a rocky start. Host Jo Koy took the stage at the
Beverly Hilton International Ballroom in Beverly Hills, California.</p>
<p>The Filipino American stand-up hit on some expected topics: Ozempic,
Meryl Streep’s knack for winning awards and the long-running
“Oppenheimer.” (“I needed another hour.”)</p>
<p>After one joke flubbed, Koy, who was named host after some bigger
names reportedly passed, also noted how fast he was thrust into the
job.</p>
<p>“Yo, I got the gig 10 days ago. You want a perfect monologue?” said
Koy. “I wrote some of these and they’re the ones you’re laughing
at.”</p>
<p>Hi, Barbie</p>
<p>Downey’s win, his third Globe, denied one to “Kenergy.” Ryan Gosling
had been seen as his stiffest competition, just one of the many
head-to-head contests between “Oppenheimer” and Greta Gerwig’s
“Barbie.”</p>
<p>The filmmakers faced each other in the best director category, where
Nolan triumphed.</p>
<p>It was two hours before “Barbie,” the year’s biggest hit with more
than $1.4 billion in ticket sales, won an award Sunday. Billie Eilish’s
“What Was I Made For?” took best song, and swiftly after, “Barbie” took
the Globes’ new honor for “cinematic and box office achievement.”</p>
<p>Some thought that award might go to Taylor Swift, whose “Taylor
Swift: The Eras Tour” also set box-office records. Swift, though,
remains winless in five Globe nods.</p>
<p>Margot Robbie, star and producer of “Barbie,” accepted the award in a
pink gown modeled after 1977’s Superstar Barbie.</p>
<p>“We’d like to dedicate this to every single person on the planet who
dressed up and went to the greatest place on Earth: the movie theaters,”
said Robbie.</p>
<p>“Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” two blockbusters brought together by a
common release date, also faced off in the best screenplay category.</p>
<p>But in an upset, Justine Triet and Arthur Harari won for the script
to the French courtroom drama “Anatomy of a Fall.” Later, Triet’s film
picked up best international film, too.</p>
<p>Though the Globes have no direct correlation with the Academy Awards,
they can boost campaigns at a crucial juncture. Oscar nomination voting
starts Thursday, and the twin sensations of Barbenheimer remain
frontrunners.</p>
<p>Other contenders loom, though, like “Poor Things” and “The
Holdovers.”</p>
<p>Paul Giamatti and Da’Vine Joy Randolph both won for Alexander Payne’s
“The Holdovers.” Giamatti, reuniting with Payne two decades after
“Sideways,” won best actor and Randolph won for her supporting
performance as a grieving woman in the 1970s-set boarding school
drama.</p>
<p>“Oh, Mary you have changed my life,” Randolph said of her character.
“You have made me feel seen in so many ways that I have never
imagined.”</p>
<p>Hayao Miyazaki’s “The Boy and the Heron” won best animated film, an
upset over “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.”</p>
<p>‘Succession,’  ‘The Bear’ Lead TV Winners</p>
<p>The final season of “Succession” cleaned up on the television side.
It won best drama series for the third time, a mark that ties a record
set by “Mad Men” and “The X-Files.” Three stars from the HBO series also
won: Matt Macfadyen, Sarah Snook and Kieran Culkin.</p>
<p>“It is bittersweet, but things like this make it rather sweeter,”
said “Succession” creator Jesse Armstrong.</p>
<p>Hulu’s “The Bear” also came away with a trio of awards, including
best comedy series. Jeremy Allen White won for the second time, but this
time he had company.</p>
<p>Ayo Edebiri won her first Globe for her leading performance in the
Hulu show’s second season. She thanked the assistants of her agents and
managers.</p>
<p>“To the people who answer my emails, you’re the real ones,” said
Edebiri.</p>
<p>“Beef” won three awards: best limited series as well as acting awards
for Ali Wong and Steven Yeun.</p>
<p>The Globes also added a new stand-up special award. That went,
surprisingly, to Ricky Gervais, who didn’t attend the show he so often
hosted. Some expected Chris Rock to win for “Selective Outrage,” his
stand-up response to the Will Smith slap.</p>
<p>The Globes Comeback</p>
<p>A few years ago, the Golden Globes were on the cusp of collapse.
After The Los Angeles Times reported that the HFPA had no Black members,
Hollywood boycotted the organization.</p>
<p>The 2022 Globes were all but canceled and taken off TV. After
reforms, the Globes returned to NBC last year in a one-year deal, but
the show was booted to Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>With Jerrod Carmichael hosting, the telecast attracted 6.3 million
viewers, a new low on NBC and a far cry from the 20 million that once
tuned in.</p>
<p>The Golden Globes were acquired by Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark
Productions, which Penske Media owns, and turned into a for-profit
venture.</p>
<p>The HFPA (which typically numbered around 90 voters) was dissolved
and a group of some 300 entertainment journalists from around the world
now vote for the awards.</p>
<p>Questions still remain about the Globes’ long-term future, but their
value to Hollywood studios remains providing a marketing boost to awards
contenders. (The Oscars won’t be held until March 10.)</p>
<p>This year, because of the actors and writers strikes, the Globes are
airing ahead of the Emmys, which were postponed to Jan. 15.</p>
<p>With movie ticket sales still 20% off the pre-pandemic pace and the
industry facing a potentially perilous 2024 at the box office, Hollywood
needed the Golden Globes as much as it ever has.</p>
<p>The most comical evaluation on the Globes came from presenters Will
Ferrell and Kristin Wiig, who blamed the awards body for the constant
interruption of a song they found irresistible while otherwise solemnly
presenting best actor in a drama.</p>
<p>A furious, dancing Ferrell shouted: “The Golden Globes have not
changed!”</p>

id="first-us-lunar-lander-in-more-than-50-years-rockets-toward-moon-with-commercial-deliveries">First
US Lunar Lander In More Than 50 Years Rockets Toward Moon With
Commercial Deliveries</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Cape Canaveral, Florida — The first U.S. lunar lander in more than 50
years rocketed toward the moon Monday, launching private companies on a
space race to make deliveries for NASA and other customers.</p>
<p>Astrobotic Technology’s lander caught a ride on a brand new rocket,
United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan. The Vulcan streaked through the Florida
predawn sky, putting the spacecraft on a roundabout route to the moon
that should culminate with an attempted landing on Feb. 23.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh company aims to be the first private business to
successfully land on the moon, something only four countries have
accomplished. But a Houston company also has a lander ready to fly, and
could beat it to the lunar surface, taking a more direct path.</p>
<p>“First to launch. First to land is TBD” — to be determined, said
Astrobotic chief executive John Thornton.</p>
<p>NASA gave the two companies millions to build and fly their own lunar
landers. The space agency wants the privately owned landers to scope out
the place before astronauts arrive while delivering NASA tech and
science experiments as well as odds and ends for other customers.</p>
<p>Astrobotic’s contract for the Peregrine lander: $108 million.</p>
<p>The last time the U.S. launched a moon-landing mission was in
December 1972.</p>
<p>Apollo 17’s Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt became the 11th and 12th
men to walk on the moon, closing out an era that has remained NASA’s
pinnacle.</p>
<p>The space agency’s new Artemis program — named after the twin sister
of Apollo in Greek mythology — looks to return astronauts to the moon’s
surface within the next few years.</p>
<p>First will be a lunar fly-around with four astronauts, possibly
before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Highlighting Monday’s moonshot was the long-delayed initial test
flight of the Vulcan rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.</p>
<p>The 61-meter rocket is essentially an upgraded version of ULA’s
hugely successful workhorse Atlas V, which is being phased out along
with the company’s Delta IV. Jeff Bezos’ rocket company, Blue Origin,
provided the Vulcan’s two main engines.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union and the U.S. racked up a string of successful moon
landings in the 1960s and 70s, before putting touchdowns on pause. China
joined the elite club in 2013 and India in 2023. But last year also saw
landers from Russia and a private Japanese company slam into the moon.
An Israeli nonprofit crashed in 2019.</p>
<p>Next month, SpaceX will provide the lift for a lander from Intuitive
Machines. The Nova-C lander’s more direct one-week route could see both
spacecraft attempting to land within days or even hours of one
another.</p>
<p>The hourlong descent to the lunar surface — by far the biggest
challenge — will be “exciting, nail-biting, terrifying all at once,”
said Thornton.</p>
<p>Besides flying experiments for NASA, Astrobotic drummed up its own
freight business, packing the 1.9-meter-tall Peregrine lander with
everything from a chip of rock from Mount Everest and toy-size cars from
Mexico that will catapult to the lunar surface and cruise around, to the
ashes and DNA of deceased space enthusiasts, including “Star Trek”
creator Gene Roddenberry and science fiction writer Arthur C.
Clarke.</p>
<p>The Navajo Nation recently sought to have the launch delayed because
of the human remains, saying it would be a “profound desecration” of a
celestial body revered by Native Americans.</p>
<p>Thornton said the December objections came too late but promised to
try to find “a good path forward” with the Navajo for future
missions.</p>
<p>One of the spaceflight memorial companies that bought room on the
lander, Celestis, said in a statement that no single culture or religion
owns the moon and should not be able to veto a mission.</p>
<p>More remains are on the rocket’s upper stage, which, once free of the
lander, will indefinitely circle the sun as far out as Mars.</p>
<p>Cargo fares for Peregrine ranged from a few hundred dollars to $1.2
million per kilogram, not nearly enough for Astrobotic to break even.
But for this first flight, that’s not the point, according to
Thornton.</p>
<p>“A lot of people’s dreams and hopes are riding on this,” he said.</p>

cooperation between orf virus and Staphylococcus aureus leads to
intractable lesions in skin infection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
A large amount of evidence shows that different kinds of microorganisms
can jointly cope with environmental pressures including cell hosts. For
example, in many cases, it has been found that secondary or mixed
infection of animals caused by ORFV (an epitheliophilic Parapoxvirus)
and bacteria (such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus) shows a
mutual aid mode that indirectly leads to the deterioration of the
disease. However, the lack of research on the co-pathogenic mechanism,
including how to hijack and destroy the cell host in the pathological
microenvironment, has hindered the in-depth understanding of the
pathogenic process and consequences of this complex infection and the
development of clinical treatment methods. Here, we summarized the
current strategies of trapping cell hosts together, based on the
previously defined ORFV-Host (O-H) system. The opportunistic invasion of
<italic>S. aureus</italic> destroyed the delicate dynamic balance of the
O-H, thus aggravating tissue damage through bacterial products (mediated
by Agr), even causing sepsis or inducing cytokine storms. In fact, the
virus products from its adaptive regulatory system (VARS) weaken the
immune attacks and block molecular pathways, so that <italic>S.
aureus</italic> can settle there more smoothly, and the toxins can
penetrate into local tissues more quickly. This paper focuses on the
main challenges faced by cell hosts in dealing with mixed infection,
which provides a starting point for us to deal with this disease in the
future.

for functional constipation in children: an overview of overlapping
systematic reviews</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
This overview of systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analysis (MAs) aimed
to systematically collate, appraise and synthesize evidence of
probiotics for functional constipation (FC) in children.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
SRs/MAs of probiotics for FC in children were systematic identified by
searching Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and Web of science.
Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR-2), Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), and
Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation
(GRADE) were unitized by two reviewers independently to assess the
methodological quality, reporting quality, and quality of evidence,
respectively.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Seven SRs/MAs met the eligibility criteria and were included in this
study. According to AMSTAR-2, a very low methodological quality
assessment was given to the included SRs/MAs due to the limitations of
items 2, 4 and 7. For the PRISMA statement, the overall quality of
reporting was unsatisfactory due to the lack of reporting on protocol,
risk of bias across studies, synthesis of results, and additional
analysis. According to GRADE, the quality of evidence for outcomes was
rated as very low to moderate.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
Probiotics may be beneficial in improving FC in children. Because of
limitations and inconsistent conclusions, further rigorous, normative
and comprehensive SRs/MAs are needed to provide robust evidence for
definitive conclusions.

effects by parasitic nematode (Trichinella spiralis) total lysates</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Obesity is an inducible factor for the cause of chronic diseases and is
described by an increase in the size and number of adipocytes that
differentiate from precursor cells (preadipocytes). Parasitic helminths
are the strongest natural trigger of type 2 immune system, and several
studies have showed that helminth infections are inversely correlated
with metabolic syndromes.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methodology/Principal findings
</title>
<p>
To investigate whether helminth-derived molecules have therapeutic
effects on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, we isolated total
lysates from <italic>Trichinella spiralis</italic> muscle larvae. We
then checked the anti-obesity effect after intraperitoneal
administration and intraoral administration of total lysate from
<italic>T. spiralis</italic> muscle larvae in a diet-induced obesity
model. <italic>T. spiralis</italic> total lysates protect against
obesity by inhibiting the proinflammatory response and/or enhancing M2
macrophages. In addition, we determined the effects of total lysates
from <italic>T. spiralis</italic> muscle larvae on anti-obesity
activities in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by investigating the expression
levels of key adipogenic regulators, including peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), CCAAT-enhancer-binding
protein alpha (C/EBPα) and adipocyte protein 2 (aP2). Oil Red O staining
showed that the total lysates from <italic>T. spiralis</italic> muscle
larvae decreased the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by
decreasing the number of lipid droplets. In addition, the production
levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ and TNF-α were
examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). <italic>T.
spiralis</italic> total lysates decreased intracellular lipid
accumulation and suppressed the expression levels of PPARγ, C/EBPα and
aP2.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion/Significance
</title>
<p>
These results show that <italic>T. spiralis</italic> total lysate
significantly suppresses the symptoms of obesity in a diet- induced
obesity model and 3T3-L1 cell differentiation and suggest that it has
potential for novel anti-obesity therapeutics.

staphylococcal small-colony variants in cardiac implantable electronic
device infections: clinical characteristics, management, and genomic
insights</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Objectives
</title>
<p>
Staphylococcal small-colony variants (SCVs) are common in cardiac
implantable electronic device (CIED) infections. This is the first
retrospective and multi-case study on CIED infections due to
staphylococcal SCVs, aiming to provide a theoretical basis for the
clinical management of CIED and device-related infections caused by
staphylococcal SCVs.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
Ninety patients with culture positive CIED infections were enrolled
between 2021 and 2022. We compared the demographic and clinical
characteristics of patients with and without SCVs and performed genomic
studies on SCVs isolates.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Compared to patients without SCVs, those with SCVs had a longer primary
pacemaker implantation time and were more likely to have a history of
device replacement and infection. They showed upregulated inflammatory
indicators, especially higher NEUT% (52.6 vs. 26.8%, <italic>P</italic>
= 0.032) and they had longer hospital stays (median 13 vs. 12 days,
<italic>P</italic> = 0.012). Comparative genomics analysis was performed
on <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> wild-type and SCVs. Some
genes were identified, including <italic>aap</italic>, genes encoding
adhesin, CHAP domain-containing protein, LPXTG cell wall anchor
domain-containing protein, and YSIRK-type signal peptide-containing
protein.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Staphylococcal SCVs affect the clinical characteristics of CIED
infections. The process of staphylococcal SCVs adherence, biofilm
formation, and interaction with neutrophils play a vital role.

<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
Antiretroviral therapy has improved life expectancy in HIV-infected
patients. However, people living with HIV under antiretroviral therapy
are at higher risks of developing chronic complications and acquiring
multidrug resistant bacteria than healthy population. These factors have
been associated with shifts in gut microbiome composition and immune
activation. It is unclear how antiretroviral drugs affect gut microbiota
composition, but it has been observed that antiretroviral treatment is
not able to fully restore gut health after HIV infection. Additionally,
some antiretroviral drugs have shown antibacterial activity suggesting
that these drugs could have a direct impact on the human microbiome
composition.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We determined the <italic>in vitro</italic> antibacterial activity of 16
antiretroviral drugs against a set of key clinically relevant and human
commensal bacterial strains.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Our results demonstrate that 5 antiretroviral drugs have <italic>in
vitro</italic> antibacterial activity against gut and vaginal human
commensal bacteria. Zidovudine has antibacterial activity against
<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella
pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Prevotella bivia</italic>, abacavir
against <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic>, efavirenz against
<italic>G. vaginalis</italic> and <italic>P. bivia</italic> and
bictegravir against <italic>Enterococcus</italic> spp. and <italic>G.
vaginalis</italic>. Moreover, we describe for the first time that
elvitegravir has antibacterial activity against <italic>G.
vaginalis</italic> and <italic>P. bivia</italic> and, most importantly,
against vancomycin-resistant <italic>Enterococcus</italic> spp. and
methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strains
with MIC values of 4-16 and 4 µg/mL, respectively showing high level of
effectiveness against the tested multidrug-resistant bacteria.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
Our results underscore that some antiretroviral drugs may influence the
human microbiota composition. In addition, we report the potential use
of elvitegravir to treat multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria
warranting the need of clinical studies to repurpose this antiretroviral
drug.

blue light-emitting diode exposure harvests gut dysbiosis related to
cholesterol dysregulation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Night shift workers have been associated with circadian dysregulation
and metabolic disorders, which are tightly coevolved with gut
microbiota. The chronic impacts of light-emitting diode (LED) lighting
at night on gut microbiota and serum lipids were investigated. Male
C57BL/6 mice were exposed to blue or white LED lighting at Zeitgeber
time 13.5-14 (ZT; ZT0 is the onset of “lights on” and ZT12 is the
“lights off” onset under 12-hour light, 12-hour dark schedule). After 33
weeks, only the high irradiance (7.2 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) of blue LED light
reduced the alpha diversity of gut microbiota. The high irradiance of
white LED light and the low irradiance (3.6 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) of both
lights did not change microbial alpha diversity. However, the low
irradiance, but not the high one, of both blue and white LED
illuminations significantly increased serum total cholesterol (TCHO),
but not triglyceride (TG). There was no significant difference of
microbial abundance between two lights. The ratio of beneficial to
harmful bacteria decreased at a low irradiance but increased at a high
irradiance of blue light. Notably, this ratio was negatively correlated
with serum TCHO but positively correlated with bile acid biosynthesis
pathway. Therefore, chronic blue LED lighting at a high irradiance may
harvest gut dysbiosis in association with decreased alpha diversity and
the ratio of beneficial to harmful bacteria to specifically dysregulates
TCHO metabolism in mice. Night shift workers are recommended to be avoid
of blue LED lighting for a long and lasting time.

<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
Senecavirus A (SVA) is a highly contagious virus that causes vesicular
disease in pigs. At present, laboratory detection methods, such as virus
isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), required precision
instruments and qualified personnel, making them unsuitable for
point-of-care tests (POCT). Fortunately, the emergence of CRISPR/Cas
system has provided new opportunities for fast and efficient pathogen
detection.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
This study successfully developed a precise and sensitive detection
platform for diagnosing SVA by combining the CRISPR system with
recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA).
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The minimum detection limit of the assay was 10 copies of the SVA
genome. Meanwhile, the assay demonstrated high specificity. To validate
the effectiveness of this system, we tested 85 swine clinical samples
and found that the fluorescence method had a 100% coincidence rate
compared to RT-qPCR.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
Overall, the RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a assay established in our study is a
highly effective method for detecting SVA and holds great potential for
practical applications in the resource-limited settings.

regulating liver activity and its potential effects on liver fibrosis
and Echinococcosis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Ghrelin widely exists in the central nervous system and peripheral
organs, and has biological activities such as maintaining energy
homeostasis, regulating lipid metabolism, cell proliferation, immune
response, gastrointestinal physiological activities, cognition, memory,
circadian rhythm and reward effects. In many benign liver diseases, it
may play a hepatoprotective role against steatosis, chronic
inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic
reticulum stress and apoptosis, and improve liver cell autophagy and
immune response to improve disease progression. However, the role of
Ghrelin in liver <italic>Echinococcosis</italic> is currently unclear.
This review systematically summarizes the molecular mechanisms by which
Ghrelin regulates liver growth metabolism, immune-inflammation,
fibrogenesis, proliferation and apoptosis, as well as its protective
effects in liver fibrosis diseases, and further proposes the role of
Ghrelin in liver <italic>Echinococcosis</italic> infection. During the
infectious process, it may promote the parasitism and survival of
parasites on the host by improving the immune-inflammatory
microenvironment and fibrosis state, thereby accelerating disease
progression. However, there is currently a lack of targeted <italic>in

this viewpoint.

<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a highly dangerous virus that is globally
prevalent and closely linked to the development of nasopharyngeal cancer
(NPC). Plasma EBV DNA analysis is an effective strategy for early
detection, prognostication and monitoring of treatment response of NPC.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
Here, we present a novel molecular diagnostic technique termed
EBV-MCDA-LFB, which integrates multiple cross displacement amplification
(MCDA) with nanoparticle-based lateral flow (LFB) to enable simple,
rapid and specific detection of EBV. In the EBV-MCDA-LFB system, a set
of 10 primers was designed for rapidly amplifying the highly conserved
tandem repeat BamHI-W region of the EBV genome. Subsequently, the LFB
facilitate direct assay reading, eliminating the use of extra
instruments and reagents.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The outcomes showed that the 65°C within 40 minutes was the optimal
reaction setting for the EBV-MCDA system. The sensitivity of
EBV-MCDA-LFB assay reached 7 copies per reaction when using EBV
recombinant plasmid, and it showed 100% specificity without any
cross-reactivity with other pathogens. The feasibility of the
EBV-MCDA-LFB method for EBV detection was successfully validated by 49
clinical plasma samples. The complete detection process, consisting of
rapid template extraction (15 minutes), MCDA reaction (65°C for 40
minutes), and LFB result reading (2 minutes), can be finalized within a
60-minutes duration.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
EBV-MCDA-LFB assay designed here is a fast, extremely sensitive and
specific technique for detecting EBV in field and at the point-of-care
(PoC), which is especially beneficial for countries and regions with a
high prevalence of the disease and limited economic resources.

critical role of neutrophil-endothelial cell interactions in sepsis: new
synergistic approaches employing organ-on-chip, omics, immune cell
phenotyping and in silico modeling to identify new therapeutics</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Sepsis is a global health concern accounting for more than 1 in 5 deaths
worldwide. Sepsis is now defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction
caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis can develop
from bacterial (gram negative or gram positive), fungal or viral (such
as COVID) infections. However, therapeutics developed in animal models
and traditional <italic>in vitro</italic> sepsis models have had little
success in clinical trials, as these models have failed to fully
replicate the underlying pathophysiology and heterogeneity of the
disease. The current understanding is that the host response to sepsis
is highly diverse among patients, and this heterogeneity impacts immune
function and response to infection. Phenotyping immune function and
classifying sepsis patients into specific endotypes is needed to develop
a personalized treatment approach. Neutrophil-endothelium interactions
play a critical role in sepsis progression, and increased neutrophil
influx and endothelial barrier disruption have important roles in the
early course of organ damage. Understanding the mechanism of
neutrophil-endothelium interactions and how immune function impacts this
interaction can help us better manage the disease and lead to the
discovery of new diagnostic and prognosis tools for effective
treatments. In this review, we will discuss the latest research
exploring how <italic>in silico</italic> modeling of a synergistic
combination of new organ-on-chip models incorporating human
cells/tissue, omics analysis and clinical data from sepsis patients will
allow us to identify relevant signaling pathways and characterize
specific immune phenotypes in patients. Emerging technologies such as
machine learning can then be leveraged to identify druggable therapeutic
targets and relate them to immune phenotypes and underlying infectious
agents. This synergistic approach can lead to the development of new
therapeutics and the identification of FDA approved drugs that can be
repurposed for the treatment of sepsis.

issues, such as drug resistance, toxicity, and high cost of drugs,
remain unresolved. Recently, the studies on the anti-HSV activities of
marine natural products, such as marine polysaccharides, marine peptides
and microbial secondary metabolites are attracting more and more
attention all over the world. This review discusses the recent progress
in research on the anti-HSV activities of these natural compounds
obtained from marine organisms, relating to their structural features
and the structure-activity relationships. In addition, the recent
findings on the different anti-HSV mechanisms and molecular targets of
marine compounds and their potential for therapeutic application will
also be summarized in detail.

<h2 id="us-congressional-leaders-announce-top-line-spending-deal">US
Congressional Leaders Announce Top-Line Spending Deal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Top U.S. congressional leaders on Sunday agreed on $1.6
trillion in top-line federal spending for fiscal year 2024 in a deal
aimed at averting a partial government shutdown later this month, U.S.
House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson said.</p>
<p>The top-line figure includes $886 billion for defense and $704
billion for non-defense spending, Johnson, a Republican, said in a
letter to lawmakers on Sunday. The defense portion had already been
signed into law by President Joe Biden last month through the defense
spending bill.</p>
<p>The non-defense discretionary funding will “protect key domestic
priorities like veterans benefits, healthcare and nutrition assistance”
from cuts sought by some Republicans, Democratic Senate Majority Leader
Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a
joint statement.</p>
<p>Their statement put non-defense spending at $772.7 billion, nearly
$69 billion more than stated by Johnson. A Democratic aide said the
additional money was “adjustments.”</p>
<p>Congress was scheduled to return to Washington this week to tackle
Jan. 19 and Feb. 2 deadlines for settling government spending through
September, amid Republican demands to reduce fiscal 2024 discretionary
spending below caps agreed to in June.</p>
<p>Last spring, Biden and then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy reached
agreement – as part of a debt-limit increase deal – on $1.59 trillion in
defense and non-defense discretionary spending.</p>
<p>Biden said on Sunday the deal moved the country one step closer to
“preventing a needless government shutdown and protecting important
national priorities.”</p>
<p>“It reflects the funding levels that I negotiated with both parties,”
Biden said in a statement after the deal was announced.</p>
<p>The Republican-controlled House and the Democratic-controlled Senate
will still have to agree on how to allocate these funds.</p>
<p>In his letter, Johnson said the “final spending levels will not
satisfy everyone, and they do not cut as much spending as many of us
would like.”</p>
<p>White House budget director Shalanda Young said on Friday she was not
optimistic about reaching a deal to avoid a partial government shutdown
later this month.</p>

Federal Judge to Decide if Georgia’s Election System Is
Constitutional</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Atlanta, Georgia — Election integrity activists want a federal judge
to order Georgia to stop using its current election system, saying it’s
vulnerable to attack and has operational issues that could cost voters
their right to cast a vote and have it accurately counted.</p>
<p>During a trial set to start Tuesday, activists plan to argue that the
Dominion Voting Systems touchscreen voting machines are so flawed they
are unconstitutional. Election officials insist the system is secure and
reliable and say it is up to the state to decide how it conducts
elections.</p>
<p>Georgia has become a pivotal electoral battleground in recent years
with national attention focused on its elections. The election system
used statewide by nearly all in-person voters includes touchscreen
voting machines that print ballots with a human-readable summary of
voters’ selections and a QR code that a scanner reads to count the
votes.</p>
<p>The activists say the state should switch to hand-marked paper
ballots tallied by scanners and needs much more robust post-election
audits than are currently in place. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg,
who’s overseeing the long-running case, said in an October order that
she cannot order the state to use hand-marked paper ballots. But
activists say prohibiting the use of the touchscreen machines would
effectively force the use of hand-marked paper ballots because that’s
the emergency backup provided for in state law.</p>
<p>Wild conspiracy theories about Dominion voting machines proliferated
in the wake of the 2020 election, spread by allies of former President
Donald Trump who said they were used to steal the election from him. The
election equipment company has fought back aggressively with litigation,
notably reaching a $787 million settlement with Fox News in April.</p>
<p>The trial set to begin Tuesday stems from a lawsuit that long
predates those claims. It was originally filed in 2017 by several
individual voters and the Coalition for Good Governance, which advocates
for election integrity, and targeted the outdated, paperless voting
system used at the time.</p>
<p>Totenberg in August 2019 prohibited the state from using the
antiquated machines beyond that year. The state had agreed to purchase
new voting machines from Dominion a few weeks earlier and scrambled to
deploy them ahead of the 2020 election cycle. Before the machines were
distributed statewide, the activists amended their lawsuit to take aim
at the new system.</p>
<p>They argue the system has serious security vulnerabilities that could
be exploited without detection and that the state has done little to
address those problems.</p>
<p>Additionally, voters cannot be sure their votes are accurately
recorded because they cannot read the QR code, they say. And the voting
machines’ large, upright screens make it easy to see a voter’s
selections, violating the right to ballot secrecy, they say.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger wrote in a recent
court filing that he “vigorously disputes” the activists’ claims and
“strongly believes” their case is “legally and factually meritless.”</p>
<p>Experts engaged by the activists have said they’ve seen no evidence
that any vulnerabilities have been exploited to change the outcome of an
election, but they say the concerns need to be addressed immediately to
protect future elections.</p>
<p>One of them, University of Michigan computer scientist J. Alex
Halderman, examined a machine from Georgia and wrote a lengthy report
detailing vulnerabilities that he said bad actors could use to attack
the system. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency,
or CISA, in June 2022 released an advisory based on Halderman’s findings
that urged jurisdictions that use the machines to quickly mitigate the
vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>During a hearing in May, a lawyer for the state told the judge
physical security elements recommended by CISA were “largely in place.”
But the secretary of state’s office has said a software update from
Dominion is too cumbersome to install before the 2024 elections.</p>
<p>The fact that the voting system software and data was uploaded to a
server and shared with an unknown number of people after unauthorized
people accessed election equipment in January 2021 makes it even easier
to plan an attack on the system, Halderman has said. That breach at the
elections office in rural Coffee County was uncovered and exposed by the
plaintiffs in the lawsuit.</p>
<p>A sprawling Fulton County racketeering indictment against Trump and
18 others included charges against four people related to Coffee County.
Two of them, including Trump-allied lawyer Sidney Powell, have pleaded
guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors.</p>
<p>In several rulings during the litigation, Totenberg has made clear
that she has concerns about the voting system. But she wrote in October
that the activists “carry a heavy burden to establish a constitutional
violation” connected to the voting system or its implementation.</p>
<p>David Cross, a lawyer for some of the individual voters, said the
judge has only seen a sliver of their evidence so far. He said he
believes she’ll find in their favor, but he doesn’t expect to see any
changes before Georgia’s presidential primary in March. He said changes
might be possible before the general election in November if Totenberg
rules quickly.</p>
<p>“We’re hopeful but we recognize it’s an uphill fight for 2024, just
on the timing,” he said, acknowledging the likelihood that the state
would appeal any ruling in the activists’ favor.</p>
<p>Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good
Governance, was similarly optimistic ahead of trial: “We have the facts
and the science and the law on our side, and really the state has no
defense.”</p>
<p>A representative for Raffensperger didn’t respond to multiple
requests to interview someone in his office ahead of the trial.</p>
<p>The activists had planned to call the secretary of state to testify.
They wanted to ask why he chose a voting system that uses QR codes that
aren’t readable by voters. They also believe his office has failed to
investigate or to implement proper safeguards after the Coffee County
breach and wanted to ask him about it under oath.</p>
<p>The judge ordered him to appear over the objections of his lawyers.
But the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday ruled he doesn’t
have to testify, citing his status as a top official and saying the
plaintiffs didn’t show his testimony was necessary.</p>
<p>“This trial bears heavily on the public interest, and voters deserve
to hear from Secretary Raffensperger in the trial. It’s a travesty that
they won’t,” Cross said. “And it’s unfair to our clients who need
answers to questions at trial that only he can provide.”</p>

id="wonka-is-no.-1-at-box-office-again-as-2024-gets-off-to-slower-start">‘Wonka’
Is No. 1 at Box Office Again as 2024 Gets Off to Slower Start</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Timothee Chalamet and “Wonka” topped the box office
charts for the third time in its four weekends in theaters. Warner
Bros.’ family-oriented musical added $14.4 million in ticket sales
according to studio estimates Sunday, bringing its total domestic
grosses to $164.7 million. </p>
<p>“‘Wonka’ is following in the tradition of a film like ‘The Greatest
Showman,’” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for
Comscore. That Hugh Jackman musical opened under $9 million in December
2017 and went on to gross $435 million globally. </p>
<p>“‘Wonka’ is a perfect crowd pleaser released at the perfect time and
it’s going to ride that wave into January,” Dergarabedian said. “It’s an
opportune time for it to be in the marketplace.” </p>
<p>After finishing 2023 on a high note, 2024 is getting off to a slower
start than last year, down around 16%, with the Universal/Blumhouse
horror “Night Swim” as the only major new offering in theaters. The
movie stars Wyatt Russell and Kerry Condon as a couple with a sinister,
supernatural swimming pool. </p>
<p>“Night Swim” drew in an estimated $12 million in its first weekend in
3,250 theaters in North America against a reported $15 million
production budget. Including international showings in 36 markets,
“Night Swim” is heading towards a $17.7 million global debut. </p>
<p>“Not only did it perform really well at the box office, but it’s
going to make us look at every swimming pool with a little more
trepidation,” said Jim Orr, Universal’s head of domestic
distribution. </p>
<p>Horror movies are largely critic-proof, but with fairly negative
reviews and a C CinemaScore rating, it’s unlikely to repeat the viral
success of last year’s demon doll movie “M3GAN.” </p>
<p>“We don’t have ‘Avatar: The Way of Water,’ which totally dominated
the box office a year ago, or ‘M3GAN,’ which made that a bigger
weekend,” said Dergarabedian. “But it’s a bit early to call it in terms
of how the year is going to turn out.” </p>
<p>Warner Bros. and Universal placed third and fourth on the charts as
well. Warner Bros.’ DC superhero movie “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom”
earned $10.6 million in its third weekend, bumping its domestic tally
just over the $100 million mark. Universal’s animated “Migration” added
$10.3 million, bringing its running domestic total to $77.8
million. </p>
<p>Sony’s Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney romantic comedy “Anyone But
You” landed in fifth place with $9.5 million, up 9% from last weekend.
The movie has grossed $43.7 million to date. </p>
<p>Cineplexes are full of awards contenders, including “The Color
Purple,” “The Iron Claw” and “Poor Things,” and the Golden Globes
broadcast Sunday night might help spread awareness for those and other
films. </p>
<p>“The Golden Globes are like a three-hour infomercial for the
industry,” Dergarabedian said. “There’s no downside to having a very
high profile telecast that puts a spotlight on the movies.” </p>
<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian
theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released
Monday. </p>

Airlines Again Grounds All Boeing 737 Max 9 Jetliners as More
Maintenance May Be Needed</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PORTLAND, Oregon — Alaska Airlines again grounded all of its Boeing
737 Max 9 jetliners on Sunday after federal officials indicated further
maintenance might be required to assure that another inflight blowout
like the one that damaged one of its planes doesn’t happen again.</p>
<p>The airline had returned 18 of its 65 737 Max 9 aircraft to service
on Saturday following inspections that came less than 24 hours after a
portion of one plane’s fuselage blew out three miles above (4.8
kilometers) above Oregon on Friday night. The depressurized plane, which
was carrying 171 passengers and six crew members, returned safely to
Portland International Airport with no serious injuries.</p>
<p>The airline said in a statement that the decision was made after
receiving a notice from the Federal Aviation Administration that
additional work might be needed. Other versions of the 737 are not
affected.</p>
<p>“These aircraft have now also been pulled from service until details
about possible additional maintenance work are confirmed with the FAA.
We are in touch with the FAA to determine what, if any, further work is
required before these aircraft are returned to service,” the airline
said.</p>
<p>The FAA had ordered the grounding of some 737 Max 9s on Saturday
until they could be inspected, a process that takes about four hours.
The world’s airlines are currently operating about 171 737 Max 9s
globally.</p>
<p>The aircraft make up about 20% of the Alaska Airlines’ fleet. As of
midday, Alaska had canceled about a fifth of its Sunday flights,
according to FlightAware.com. United Airlines, which also grounded its
Max 9s, had about a 10% cancellation rate on Sunday.</p>
<p>The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating Friday’s
accident and is still looking for the door from the paneled-over exit
that blew out. They have a good idea of where it landed, near Oregon
Route 217 and Barnes Road in the Cedar Hills area west of Portland, NTSB
Chair Jennifer Homendy said at a news conference late Saturday.</p>
<p>“If you find that, please, please contact local law enforcement,” she
said.</p>
<p>It was extremely lucky that the airplane had not yet reached cruising
altitude, when passengers and flight attendants might be walking around
the cabin, Homendy said.</p>
<p>“No one was seated in 26A and B where that door plug is, the aircraft
was around 16,000 feet and only 10 minutes out from the airport when the
door blew,” she said. The investigation is expected to take months.</p>
<p>There has not been a major crash involving a U.S. passenger carrier
within the country since 2009 when a Colgan Air flight crashed near
Buffalo, New York, killing all 49 people on board and one person on the
ground. In 2013, an Asiana Airlines flight arriving from South Korea
crashed at San Francisco International Airport, killing three of the 307
people on board.</p>
<p>Flight 1282 took off from Portland at 5:07 p.m. Friday for a two-hour
flight to Ontario, California. About six minutes later, the chunk of the
fuselage blew out as the plane was at about 16,000 feet (4.8
kilometers). One of the pilots declared an emergency and asked for
clearance to descend to 10,000 feet (3 kilometers), the altitude where
the air would have enough oxygen to breathe safely.</p>
<p>Videos posted by passengers online showed a gaping hole where the
paneled-over exit had been and passengers wearing masks. They applauded
when the plane landed safely about 13 minutes after the blowout.
Firefighters then came down the aisle, asking passengers to remain in
their seats as they treated the injured.</p>
<p>The aircraft involved rolled off the assembly line and received its
certification two months ago, according to online FAA records. It had
been on 145 flights since entering commercial service Nov. 11, said
FlightRadar24, another tracking service. The flight from Portland was
the aircraft’s third of the day.</p>
<p>Aviation experts were stunned that a piece would fly off a new
aircraft. Anthony Brickhouse, a professor of aerospace safety at
Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said he has seen panels of
fuselage come off planes before, but couldn’t recall one where
passengers “are looking at the lights of the city.”</p>
<p>He said the incident is a reminder for passengers to stay buckled
in.</p>
<p>“If there had been a passenger in that window seat who just happened
to have their seat belt off, we’d be looking at a totally different news
story.”</p>
<p>The Max is the newest version of Boeing’s venerable 737, a
twin-engine, single-aisle plane frequently used on U.S. domestic
flights. The plane went into service in May 2017.</p>
<p>The president of the union representing flight attendants at 19
airlines, including Alaska Airlines, commended the crew for keeping
passengers safe.</p>
<p>“Flight Attendants are trained for emergencies and we work every
flight for aviation safety first and foremost,” Sara Nelson, president
of the Association of Flight Attendants, said in a statement
Saturday.</p>
<p>Two Max 8 jets crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people and
leading to a near two-year worldwide grounding of all Max 8 and Max 9
planes. They returned to service only after Boeing made changes to an
automated flight control system implicated in the crashes.</p>
<p>Last year, the FAA told pilots to limit use of an anti-ice system on
the Max in dry conditions because of concern that inlets around the
engines could overheat and break away, possibly striking the plane.</p>
<p>Max deliveries have been interrupted at times to fix manufacturing
flaws. The company told airlines in December to inspect the planes for a
possible loose bolt in the rudder-control system.</p>

“everything” becomes too much: the npm package chaos of 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>Happy 2024, folks! Just when we thought we’d seen it all, an npm user
named PatrickJS, aka gdi2290, threw us a curveball. He (along with a
group of contributors) kicked off the year with a bang, launching a
troll campaign that uploaded an npm package aptly named everything. This
package, true to its name, depends on every other public npm package,
creating millions of transitive dependencies. The everything package and
its 3,000+ sub-packages have caused a Denial of Service (DOS) for anyone
who installs it. We’re talking about storage space running out and
system resource exhaustion. But that’s not all. The creator took their
prank to the next level by setting up http://everything.npm.lol,
showcasing the chaos they unleashed. They even included a meme from
Skyrim, adding some humor (or mockery, depending on your perspective) to
the situation. ↫ Feross Aboukhadijeh I know this is a bad thing, you
shouldn’t do this, it harms a lot of people, etc., etc., but let’s be
honest here – this is a hilarious prank that showcased a weakness in a
rather playful way. Sure, there were real consequences, but it doesn’t
seem like any of them caused any permanent damage, data loss, or
compromised systems. What’s worse, it seems this isn’t even the first
time stuff like this happened, so I find it baffling people can still do
this. What are they doing over there?</p>

<p>date: 2024-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEVERLY HILLS, California — Margot Robbie, Oprah Winfrey and Leonardo
DiCaprio will mingle with other top stars on Sunday at the Golden Globe
awards, Hollywood’s first big celebration since twin strikes shut down
most of show business last year. </p>
<p>The red carpet, champagne-fueled awards ceremony will honor the best
of film and television selected by a new group of 300 entertainment
journalists from around the world, part of reforms made after a
diversity and ethics scandal among voters.  </p>
<p>“Barbie,” the summer blockbuster starring Robbie as the iconic doll,
leads all nominees with nine nominations. Historical drama
“Oppenheimer,” about the making of the atomic bomb, follows with eight
nods. </p>
<p>The Globes kick off Hollywood’s annual awards season, which
culminates with the Oscars on March 10, and will bring top stars
together after six months of strikes by actors and writers in 2023. The
ceremony will give celebrities the chance to shine a spotlight on their
films and TV shows after months when promotion was prohibited.  </p>
<p>“I’m a little biased, but this is the best awards show and we’re
going to have fun,” said comedian Jo Koy, who will host his first major
awards show starting at 8 p.m. ET (0100 GMT on Monday). </p>
<p>The ceremony will be broadcast live on U.S. TV network CBS and
streamed simultaneously for subscribers to Paramount+ with
Showtime. </p>
<p>Acting nominees include Robbie and “Barbie” co-star Ryan Gosling,
plus “Oppenheimer” stars Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. DiCaprio,
Lily Gladstone and Robert De Niro, who starred in Martin Scorsese’s
“Killers of the Flower Moon,” also are up for trophies.  </p>
<p>Winfrey is among the night’s presenters. Pop superstar Taylor Swift
also may join the A-list crowd as a nominee for “Taylor Swift: The Eras
Tour,” her concert film that is in the running in a new category for
cinematic and box office achievement.  </p>
<p>In the television field, “Succession” is expected to win accolades
for its final season about the high-stakes battle for control of a
global media empire. It leads all nominees with nine nods, followed by
restaurant dramedy “The Bear” with five. </p>
<p>There are 27 first-time nominees for this year’s Globes.  </p>
<p>Known as a boozy celebration more relaxed than the Oscars, the Globes
nearly became extinct. A 2021 Los Angeles Times report revealed ethical
lapses and a lack of diversity among the roughly 80 members of the
Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the group that previously voted on
the Globes. The 2022 ceremony was scrapped while the organization made
reforms. </p>
<p>Last year, the Globes were sold to new owners and the association was
disbanded. Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions now operate
the awards, with a voting body of 300 journalist members from 75
countries with 60% racial and ethnic diversity. </p>
<p>The changes appear to have persuaded Hollywood’s top talent to
embrace the show and its new members. </p>
<p>“They’re trying to announce that they’re new and improved,” said
Joyce Eng, senior editor at awards website Gold Derby. “I feel like
people are more receptive to them.”</p>

Citizen files questionable complaint against Toyota</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-07, from: San Jose Mercury News</p>
<p>Public Citizen is a consumer rights advocacy group that works to
insure corporate accountability. On December 13th, the non-profit filed
a formal complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) accusing
Toyota of deceptive marketing practices. The complaint alleges that the
automaker is misleading consumers by marketing its hybrids and plug-in
hybrids as “EVs” and using words like “electrified” to describe its
extensive lineup of green vehicles.</p>

<p>
After reporting on the open access movement for 20+ years I have reached
the conclusion that the movement has failed. 
</p>
<p>
As a result, I shall no longer be writing about open access or updating
this blog.
</p>
<p>
I explain my reasons for reaching the conclusion I have
in <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/12/07/where-did-the-open-access-movement-go-wrong-an-interview-with-richard-poynder/" target="_blank">this
Q&amp;A</a> on <i>The Scholarly Kitchen</i> website. 
</p>
<p>
I would like to thank those who wished me well when
I <a href="https://x.com/RickyPo/status/1728308480321229067?s=20" target="_blank">announced
my decision</a> and I wish all those who continue to advocate for open
access the very best. 
</p>
<p>
My challenge to the latter is: please prove me wrong!

<h2 id="china-sanctions-5-us-defense-companies">China Sanctions 5 US
Defense Companies</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIJING — China announced sanctions Sunday on five American
defense-related companies in response to U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and
U.S sanctions on Chinese companies and individuals.</p>
<p>The sanctions will freeze any property the companies have in China
and prohibit organizations and individuals in China from doing business
with them, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement posted online.</p>
<p>It was unclear what impact, if any, the sanctions would have on the
companies, BAE Systems Land and Armaments, Alliant Techsystems
Operations, AeroVironment, ViaSat and Data Link Solutions. Such
sanctions are often mostly symbolic as American defense contractors
generally don’t sell to China.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry said the U.S. moves harmed China’s sovereignty
and security interests, undermined peace and stability across the Taiwan
Strait and violated the rights and interests of Chinese companies and
individuals.</p>
<p>“The Chinese government remains unwavering in our resolve to
safeguard national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity and
protect the lawful rights and interests of Chinese companies and
citizens,” the ministry statement said.</p>
<p>The announcement was made less than a week ahead of a presidential
election in Taiwan that is being contested in large part over how the
government should manage its relationship with China, which claims the
self-governing island as its territory and says it must come under its
rule.</p>
<p>The Chinese Foreign Ministry did not specify which arms deal or which
U.S. sanctions China was responding to, though spokesperson Wang Wenbin
had warned three weeks ago that China would take countermeasures
following the U.S. government’s approval of a $300 million military
package for Taiwan in December.</p>
<p>The deal includes equipment, training and equipment repair to
maintain Taiwan’s command, control and military communications
capabilities.</p>
<p>The U.S. said the sale would support the modernization of Taiwan’s
armed forces and the maintenance of a credible defense. “The proposed
sale will improve the recipient’s capability to meet current and future
threats by enhancing operational readiness,” a news release from the
Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency said.</p>
<p>Taiwan is a major flashpoint in U.S.-China relations that analysts
worry could explode into military conflict between the two powers. China
says that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan are interference in its domestic
affairs.</p>
<p>The Chinese military regularly sends fighter planes and ships into
and over the waters around Taiwan, in part to deter the island’s
government from declaring formal independence. An invasion doesn’t
appear imminent, but the constant military activity serves as a reminder
that the threat is ever-present.</p>
<p>The U.S. switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in
1979, but it is bound by its own laws to ensure that Taiwan has the
ability to defend itself. America and its allies sail warships through
the Taiwan Strait, a 160-kilometer-wide waterway that separates the
island from China.</p>

<h2
id="asian-restaurant-in-us-battles-racist-stereotype-of-dog-eating">Asian
Restaurant in US Battles Racist Stereotype of Dog-Eating</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>FRESNO, Calif. — David Rasavong’s cultural pride is evident all
throughout his restaurant.</p>
<p>It’s on the wall of family portraits and where a stunning mural
depicts his family’s journey from Laos to California. It’s on the menu
filled with Lao and Thai dishes like the crispy coconut rice salad of
Nam Khao and the stir-fried rice noodles of Pad See Ew.</p>
<p>And it’s in the fact that Love &amp; Thai in Fresno, California,
restaurant is open at all. A baseless accusation grounded in a racist
stereotype about Asian food using dog meat brought a six-month barrage
of harassment so heated that Rasavong, 41, closed down its previous
location over fears for his family’s safety.</p>
<p>His earlier restaurant had itself only been open for seven months
when a so-called animal welfare crusader in May implied on social media
that a pitbull tied up at an unconnected home next door was going to be
served on the menu.</p>
<p>A day after the initial commentary, vitriolic statements, voicemails
and calls rained down. Rasavong’s body still tenses up when recounting,
in particular, a call from an elderly woman.</p>
<p>“She was so disgusted by me and yelling and screaming, and the only
thing I can remember hearing her say at the end was ‘Go back to the
country you came from you dog-eating mother-effer,’” Rasavong recently
told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Within days, he closed that restaurant because it no longer felt safe
between the harassment and people loitering in the parking lot outside
of business hours.</p>
<p>The false accusation tapped into a longstanding slur against Asian
cuisines and cultures that has persisted in the U.S. for over 150 years,
dating back to the xenophobia that grew in the U.S. after Chinese
immigrants started arriving in more visible numbers in the 1800s and
other Asian communities followed. It’s also one that Asian American
communities are fighting against.</p>
<p>It may be astonishing to some that a claim rooted in a racist
stereotype took down a family’s restaurant three years after “Stop Asian
Hate” became a rallying cry. But for many Asian Americans and Pacific
Islanders, it’s something they’ve heard before as an insult or under the
guise of a “joke,” along with other negative reactions to the actual
foods of their cultures. In December, a comedian received some backlash
for dressing like a UPS delivery driver and walking into an Asian
restaurant with caged puppies for a social media video.</p>
<p>There is hope though that more people will learn to tell truth from
trope. Since the pandemic first fueled anti-Asian hostilities, AAPI
communities themselves have tried to take control of the narrative that
Asian food is “dirty,” “weird” yet “exotic.” Furthermore, the appetite
to learn about food from the Asian diaspora has only grown across
traditional and new media.</p>
<p>Still, there were moments where Rasavong felt like nobody, even
media, was on his side. He said a few reporters approached him assuming
the claims were true.</p>
<p>But he soon received tons of community support, and the closure ended
up being a new beginning.</p>
<p>A shopping center property manager offered him the chance to take
over a suite vacated by another restaurant. Nkundwe P. van
Wort-Kasyanju, a graphic designer in the Netherlands, and Los
Angeles-based interior designer Danny Gonzales proffered their services
for free. Hana Luna Her, a local artist, painted the mural. By the
Nov. 3 grand opening of the new space, Love &amp; Thai definitely felt
the love. The place was bustling all day, Rasavong said, and the city
presented a proclamation.</p>
<p>Rasavong is holding onto the belief that he went through this whole
saga for a reason.</p>
<p>“There’s a journey that we’re supposed to go on,” said Rasavong, who
declined to say if he’ll pursue legal action. “Don’t get me wrong.
People need to realize this business is not easy … But you know, we
believe in what we’re doing and so far so good.”</p>
<p>In actuality, consuming dog meat is something that has happened in
various parts of the world for centuries, where they weren’t seen as
domesticated family pets, said Robert Ku, author of Dubious Gastronomy:
The Cultural Politics of Eating Asian in the USA. Greeks and Romans
referenced it. The French also ate dog meat during World War II.</p>
<p>But when Chinese immigrants came to the U.S., it was linked to them
as part of “the myths that the Chinese were these bizarre people who had
bizarre diets,” Ku said. “It was one of the attractions of actually
going to Chinese restaurants back in the day because it came with
‘danger.’”</p>
<p>As other Asian immigrant groups came, the stereotype spread to
include them.</p>
<p>“This is a real just blurring of the Asian identity where it doesn’t
matter if you’re Thai or Korean or Vietnamese or Cambodian. You’re all
the same,” Ku said.</p>
<p>Along with the false allegation of eating dog meat, Asian Americans
and Pacific Islanders over the generations have often faced disgust and
worse from others when they’ve brought their cultures’ foods from home
to public spaces like school or work.</p>
<p>They’re taking steps to fight back, like in 2021, when San
Francisco-Bay Area-based writers Diann Leo-Omine. Anthony Shu and
Shirley Huey self-published Lunchbox Moments, a compilation of over two
dozen personal essays and illustrations that raised $6,000 for
charity.</p>
<p>The project became “a powerful thing for all of us,” Leo-Omine
said.</p>
<p>“We tried to show it’s not always about being in relation to being
American or being white or assimilated,” she said. “You can have moments
of joy, too…I hope that it opened people’s minds a little bit more — or
made them want to try new foods.”</p>
<p>It’s actually been a big year in publishing and food media for Asian
cuisine. Publishers Weekly dedicated a feature in August entirely to
Chinese and Taiwanese food after observing nine new cookbooks on the
subjects were coming out this year. Several of the authors grew up
outside of Asia. The titles range from Vegan Chinese Food, to Kung Food
and A Very Chinese Cookbook from America’s Test Kitchen. Also,
children’s book author Grace Lin released Chinese Menu, which relays
folklore behind favorite Chinese American dishes. They all share
personal anecdotes and readers often seem drawn to “personality-driven”
cookbooks, said Carolyn Juris, features editor.</p>
<p>“It’s not just about the recipes. It’s about the stories behind them
and I think people respond to that,” Juris said.</p>
<p>Like any other culture, Asian cultures encompass many different
regional cuisines and nuances. With the growing Asian diaspora, it’s not
strange that so many cookbooks can be mined and “publishers are savvy
enough to know that there is a market for these books,” Juris added.</p>
<p>Back at Love &amp; Thai, Rasavong is busy filling online orders for a
waiting third-party delivery driver. He is optimistic about keeping up
business now that the initial hoopla around his restaurant renaissance
has calmed down. Rasavong also hopes his situation will remind others to
think before they speak.</p>
<p>“People say these jokes and they think it’s just fun and just
light-hearted,” he said. “There are certain things that you shouldn’t
say that really do cross a line.”</p>

id="illegal-border-crossings-into-us-drop-after-mexico-boosts-enforcement">Illegal
Border Crossings Into US Drop After Mexico Boosts Enforcement</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>EAGLE PASS, Texas — Daniel Bermudez’s family had fled Venezuela and
was headed to the U.S. to seek asylum when the freight train they were
riding through Mexico was stopped by immigration officials.</p>
<p>His wife tried to explain that her family had permission to go to the
U.S. Instead, they flew her to Mexico’s southern border as part of a
surge of enforcement actions that U.S. officials say have contributed to
a sharp drop in illegal border crossings.</p>
<p>In addition to forcing migrants from trains, Mexico also resumed
flying and busing them to the southern part of the country and started
flying some home to Venezuela.</p>
<p>Even if temporary, the decrease in illegal crossings is welcome news
for the White House. President Joe Biden’s administration is locked in
talks with Senate negotiators over restricting asylum and $110 billion
in aid for Ukraine and Israel hangs in the balance.</p>
<p>Bermudez said his wife became separated from her family when she
talked to authorities as he gathered his stepchild and their belongings.
He wanted to run, but his wife said they shouldn’t because they had
followed procedure by making an appointment with U.S. immigration
authorities.</p>
<p>“I told her, ‘Don’t trust them. Let’s go into the brush,’” Bermudez
said, adding that other migrants had fled. He recalled her telling him,
“Why are they sending us back if we have an appointment?”</p>
<p>Last week, Bermudez, his stepchild and two other relatives were
waiting for her at a shelter in the Mexican border town of Piedras
Negras as she took a bus back in hopes of still making the date.</p>
<p>Mexico’s immigration agency sent at least 22 flights from its border
region with the U.S. to southern cities during the last 10 days of
December, according to Witness at the Border, an advocacy group that
tracks flight data. Most were from Piedras Negras, which is across the
border from Eagle Pass, Texas.</p>
<p>Mexico also ran two removal flights to Venezuela with 329 migrants.
The stretch was punctuated by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s
visit to Mexico City on December 28 to confront unprecedented crossings
to the United States.</p>
<p>Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said a financial
shortfall that had led the immigration agency to suspend deportations
and other operations was resolved. He did not offer details.</p>
<p>Arrests for illegal crossings into the U.S. from Mexico fell to about
2,500 on Monday, down from more than 10,000 on several days in December,
according to U.S. authorities. In the Border Patrol’s busiest area,
arrests totaled 13,800 during the seven-day period ending Friday, down
29% from 19,400 two weeks earlier, according to Tucson, Arizona, sector
chief John Modlin.</p>
<p>The drop led U.S. Customs and Border Protection to reopen the port of
entry in Lukeville, Arizona, on Thursday after a monthlong closure on
the most direct route from Phoenix to its nearest beaches. The U.S. also
restored operations at Eagle Pass and three other locations.</p>
<p>Merchants in Eagle Pass, a city of about 30,000 people, saw sales
take “a major hit” while a bridge was closed to vehicle traffic so
border agents could be reassigned to help process migrants, Maverick
County Judge Ramsey English Cantu said.</p>
<p>“We survive pretty much from everything that comes from the Mexican
side,” he said.</p>
<p>Last month, CBP resumed freight crossings in Eagle Pass and El Paso,
Texas, after a five-day shutdown that U.S. officials said was a response
to as many as 1,000 migrants riding atop a single train through Mexico
before trying to walk across the border.</p>
<p>In Piedras Negras on Thursday, Casa del Migrante housed about 200
migrants, down from as high as 1,500 recently.</p>
<p>Among them was Manuel Rodriguez, 40, who said his family will miss
their appointment to seek asylum that was made through the U.S.
government’s CBP One app. He said the appointment was registered with
his in-laws, who were deported to Venezuela after authorities boarded
the bus they were riding.</p>
<p>“It was all under her name and she lost everything,” Rodriguez
said.</p>
<p>Proposals being discussed by the White House and Senate negotiators
include a new expulsion authority that would deny rights to seek asylum
if illegal border crossings reach a certain threshold. Any such
authority would almost certainly depend on Mexico’s willingness to take
back non-Mexicans who enter the U.S illegally, something it does now on
a limited scale.</p>
<p>Mexico’s support was critical to defunct Trump-era policies that
forced 70,000 asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico for hearings in U.S.
immigration court and to deny rights to seek asylum during the COVID-19
pandemic.</p>
<p>Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute in
Washington, D.C., cautioned against overstating Mexico’s role in the
recent drop in traffic. Panama reported that less than 25,000 migrants
walked through the Darién jungle in December, about half of October’s
level and a sign that fewer people are leaving South America for the
U.S. Migration usually drops in December amid holidays and cold
weather.</p>
<p>“The U.S. is able to lean on Mexico for a short-term enforcement
effect on migration at the border, but the long-term effects are not
always clear,” Selee said.</p>

Coal Miners Unearth Mammoth Tusk Buried for Thousands of Years</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BISMARCK, ND — The first person to spot it was a shovel operator
working the overnight shift, eyeing a glint of white as he scooped up a
giant mound of dirt and dropped it into a dump truck.</p>
<p>Later, after the truck driver dumped the load, a dozer driver was
ready to flatten the dirt but stopped for a closer look when he, too,
spotted that bit of white.</p>
<p>Only then did the miners realize they had unearthed something
special: a 2-meter-long mammoth tusk that had been buried for thousands
of years.</p>
<p>“We were very fortunate, lucky to find what we found,” said David
Straley, an executive of North American Coal, which owns the mine.</p>
<p>The miners unearthed the tusk from an old streambed, about 12.1
meters deep, at the Freedom Mine near Beulah, North Dakota. The
18,210-hectare surface mine produces up to 14.5 million metric tons of
lignite coal per year.</p>
<p>After spotting the tusk, the crews stopped digging in the area and
called in experts, who estimated it to be 10,000 to 100,000 years
old.</p>
<p>Jeff Person, a paleontologist with the North Dakota Geologic Survey,
was among those to respond. He expressed surprise that the mammoth tusk
hadn’t suffered more damage, considering the massive equipment used at
the site.</p>
<p>“It’s miraculous that it came out pretty much unscathed,” Person
said.</p>
<p>A subsequent dig at the discovery site found more bones. Person
described it as a “trickle of finds,” totaling more than 20 bones,
including a shoulder blade, ribs, a tooth and parts of hips, but it’s
likely to be the most complete mammoth found in North Dakota, where it’s
much more common to dig up an isolated mammoth bone, tooth or piece of a
tusk.</p>
<p>“It’s not a lot of bones compared to how many are in the skeleton,
but it’s enough that we know that this is all associated, and it’s a lot
more than we’ve ever found of one animal together, so that’s really
given us some significance,” Person said.</p>
<p>Mammoths once roamed across parts of Africa, Asia, Europe and North
America. Specimens have been found throughout the United States and
Canada, said Paul Ullmann, a University of North Dakota vertebrate
paleontologist.</p>
<p>The mine’s discovery is fairly rare in North Dakota and the region,
as many remains of animals alive during the last Ice Age were destroyed
by glaciations and movements of ice sheets, Ullmann said.</p>
<p>Other areas have yielded more mammoth remains, such as bonebeds of
skeletons in Texas and South Dakota. People even have found frozen
carcasses in the permafrost of Canada and Siberia, he said.</p>
<p>Mammoths went extinct about 10,000 years ago in what is now North
Dakota, according to the Geologic Survey. They were larger than
elephants today and were covered in thick wool. Cave paintings dating
back 13,000 years depict mammoths.</p>
<p>Ullmann calls mammoths “media superstars almost as much as
dinosaurs,” citing the Ice Age film franchise.</p>
<p>This ivory tusk, weighing more than 22.6 kilograms, is considered
fragile. It has been wrapped in plastic as paleontologists try to
control how fast it dehydrates. Too quickly, and the bone could break
apart and be destroyed, Person said.</p>
<p>Other bones also have been wrapped in plastic and placed in drawers.
The bones will remain in plastic for at least several months until the
scientists can figure how to get the water out safely. The
paleontologists will identify the mammoth species later, Person
said.</p>
<p>The mining company plans to donate the bones to the state for
educational purposes.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to give it to the kids,” Straley said.</p>
<p>North Dakota has a landscape primed for bones and fossils, including
dinosaurs. Perhaps the best-known fossil from the state is that of
Dakota, a mummified duckbilled dinosaur with fossilized skin, Ullmann
said.</p>
<p>The state’s rich fossil record is largely due to the landscape’s
“low-elevation, lush, ecologically productive environments in the past,”
Ullmann said.</p>
<p>North Dakota’s location adjacent to the Rocky Mountains puts it in
the path of eroding sediments and rivers, which have buried animal
remains for 80 million years or more, he said.</p>
<p>“It’s been a perfect scenario that we have really productive
environments with a lot of life, but we also had the perfect scenario,
geologically, to bury the remains,” Ullmann said.</p>

Downplays Jan. 6 Capitol Siege, Calls Jailed Rioters ‘Hostages’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEWTON, Iowa — Former President Donald Trump, campaigning in Iowa on
Saturday, marked the third anniversary of the January 6, 2021, assault
on the U.S. Capitol by casting the migrant surge on the southern border
as the “real” insurrection.</p>
<p>Just over a week before the Republican nomination process begins with
Iowa’s kickoff caucuses, Trump did not explicitly acknowledge the date.
But he continued to claim that countries have been emptying jails and
mental institutions to fuel a record number of migrant crossings, even
though there is no evidence that is the case.</p>
<p>“When you talk about insurrection, what they’re doing, that’s the
real deal. That’s the real deal. Not patriotically and peacefully —
peacefully and patriotically,” Trump said, quoting from his speech on
January 6, before a violent mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol as
part of a desperate bid to keep him in power after his 2020 election
loss.</p>
<p>Trump’s remarks in Newton in central Iowa came a day after Biden
delivered a speech near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, where he cast Trump
as a grave threat to democracy and called January 6 a day when “we
nearly lost America — lost it all.”</p>
<p>With a likely rematch of the 2020 election looming, both President
Joe Biden and Trump have frequently invoked January 6 on the campaign
trail. Trump, who is under federal indictment for his efforts to
overturn his 2020 loss to Biden, has consistently downplayed or spread
conspiracy theories about a riot in which his supporters — spurred by
his lies about election fraud — tried to disrupt the certification of
Biden’s win.</p>
<p>Trump also continued to bemoan the treatment of those who have been
jailed for participating in the riot, again labeling them “hostages.”
More than 1,230 people have been charged with federal crimes connected
to the violence, including assaulting police officers and seditious
conspiracy.</p>
<p>“They ought to release the J6 hostages. They’ve suffered enough,” he
said in Clinton, in the state’s far east. “Release the J6 hostages, Joe.
Release ’em, Joe. You can do it real easy, Joe,” he said.</p>
<p>Trump was holding the commit-to-caucus events just over a week before
voting will begin on January 15. He arrived at his last event nearly
three-and-a-half hours late due to what he said was a mechanical issue
with a rented plane.</p>
<p>After Trump spoke in Newton, he signed hats and other items people in
the crowd passed to him, including a copy of a Playboy magazine that
featured him on the cover.</p>
<p>One man in the crowd, Dick Green, was standing about 15 feet away,
weeping after the former president autographed his white “Trump Country”
hat and shook his hand.</p>
<p>“It’ll never get sold. It will be in my family,” Green said of the
hat.</p>
<p>A caucus captain and a pastor in Brighton, Iowa, Green said he had
prayed for four years to meet Trump.</p>
<p>“I’ll never forget it,” he said. “It’s just the beginning of his next
presidency.”</p>
<p>Trump spent much of the day assailing Biden, casting him as
incompetent and the real threat to democracy. But he also attacked
fellow Republicans, including the late Sen. John McCain of Arizona,
whose “no” vote derailed GOP efforts to repeal former President Barack
Obama’s signature healthcare law.</p>
<p>“John McCain, for some reason, couldn’t get his arm up that day,”
said Trump of McCain, who was shot down over Vietnam in 1967 and spent
5½ years as a prisoner of war. The injuries he suffered left him unable
to lift his arms over his head for the rest of his life. His daughter,
Meghan McCain, responded on X, the site formerly known as Twitter,
calling Trump an expletive and her father an “American hero.”</p>
<p>Earlier Saturday, Trump courted young conservative activists in Des
Moines, speaking to members of Run GenZ, an organization that encourages
young conservatives to run for office.</p>
<p>Trump’s campaign is hoping to turn out thousands of supporters who
have never caucused before as part of a show of force aimed at denying
his rivals momentum and demonstrating his organizing prowess heading
into the general election.</p>
<p>His chief rivals, former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley and
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, were also campaigning in the state as they
battle for second place in hopes of emerging as the most viable
alternative to Trump, who is leading by wide margins in early state and
national polls.</p>
<p>Trump has used the trip to step up his attacks against Haley, who has
been gaining ground. He again cast her Saturday as insufficiently
conservative and a “globalist” beholden to Wall Street donors, and
accused her of being disloyal for running against him.</p>
<p>“Nikki will sell you out just like she sold me out,” he charged.</p>
<p>On Friday, Trump had highlighted several recent Haley statements that
drew criticism, including her comment that voters in New Hampshire
correct Iowa’s mistakes (“You don’t have to be corrected,” he said.) and
her failure to mention slavery when asked what had caused the Civil
War.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if it’s going to have an impact, but you know like …
slavery’s sort of the obvious answer as opposed to her three paragraphs
of bulls—,” he told a crowd Friday.</p>
<p>In Newton, he said that he was fascinated by the “horrible” war,
which he suggested he could have prevented.</p>
<p>“It’s so fascinating,” he said. “It’s just different. I just find it…
I’m so attracted to seeing it… So many mistakes were made. See that was
something I think could have been negotiated, to be honest with
you.”</p>
<p>Haley’s campaign has pointed to his escalating attention, including a
new attack ad, as evidence Trump is worried about her momentum.</p>
<p>“God bless President Trump, he’s been on a temper tantrum every day
about me … and everything he’s saying is not true,” Haley told a crowd
Saturday in North Liberty, Iowa.</p>

Defense Secretary Takes Responsibility for Secrecy About His
Hospitalization</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement
on Saturday he took “full responsibility” for secrecy surrounding an
ongoing, weeklong hospitalization for a still unspecified medical
condition. </p>
<p>Austin, who is 70, was admitted on New Year’s Day to Walter Reed
National Military Medical Center for what the Pentagon has said were
“complications following a recent elective medical procedure,” a fact
the Defense Department kept under wraps for five days. </p>
<p>Austin sits just below President Joe Biden at the top of the chain of
command of the U.S. military and his duties require him being available
at a moment’s notice to respond to any manner of national security
crisis. </p>
<p>It remains unclear the extent to which his duties were delegated to
his deputy, Kathleen Hicks, or whether Austin was involved in any key
decisions during his absence. </p>
<p>The Pentagon has yet to detail why Austin is being treated, whether
he lost consciousness over the past week, or offer details on when he
might be released. </p>
<p>“I recognize I could have done a better job ensuring the public was
appropriately informed. I commit to doing better,” Austin said in a
written statement. “But this is important to say: this was my medical
procedure, and I take full responsibility for my decisions about
disclosure.” </p>
<p>A spokesperson said on Saturday that Austin resumed his full duties
on Friday evening but remained in the hospital. </p>
<p>The Pentagon Press Association, in a letter to Pentagon officials on
Friday evening, criticized the Defense Department’s secrecy, saying
Austin was a public figure who had no claim to medical privacy in such a
situation. </p>
<p>It also noted that even U.S. presidents disclose when they must
delegate duties due to medical procedures. </p>
<p>“At a time when there are growing threats to U.S. military service
members in the Middle East and the U.S. is playing key national security
roles in the wars in Israel and Ukraine, it is particularly critical for
the American public to be informed about the health status and
decision-making ability of its top defense leader,” wrote the
association, whose board of directors includes Reuters correspondent
Phil Stewart.</p>
<p>Military Reporters and Editors (MRE), a non-profit organization for
journalists covering the U.S. military, said the decision to release the
information on a Friday evening, when online readership is typically
lower, “is keeping in the worst traditions of obfuscation and
opacity.” </p>
<p>“This is a violation of the intent and spirit of the Pentagon’s own
Principles of Information, and it fails to meet the standards of public
disclosure for senior government officials unable to exercise their
duties,” MRE wrote in a statement.</p>
