## Biden hosts Czech leader to promote Ukraine aid amid delay in Congress

date: 2024-04-15, from: VOA News USA

washington — President Joe Biden urged the U.S. House to immediately take up Senate-passed supplemental funding for Ukraine and Israel on Monday as he hosted Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala in the Oval Office. 


The visit came as Biden aimed to highlight the efforts other nations are making to support Ukraine. It followed the Czech government's announcement that it is sending 1 million rounds of artillery ammunition to Ukraine, which Kyiv says is badly needed on the battlefield against Russia's invasion. 


"As the Czech Republic remembers, Russia won't stop at Ukraine," Biden said. He appealed to Congress to pass the supplemental funding so the U.S. could do its part to help Ukraine. "They have to do it now," he said. 


Fiala praised the U.S. president for his leadership in support of Ukraine, adding, "We are also doing our best." 


He said, "In 1968 I saw Russian tanks in the streets of my town, and I don't want to see this again." 


Biden called the Czech Republic a "great ally" in NATO, as Fiala said his country's decision to purchase F-35 fighter jets from the U.S. will "make our cooperation and security much stronger." 


Fiala told reporters following his meeting with Biden that he would meet with lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Tuesday to further discuss Ukraine aid. 


"The support from U.S., the help from U.S., is very important," Fiala said.

## Fedora intends to fully embrace “AI”, but doesn’t address sourcing or its environmental impact

date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News

All weekend, I&#8217;ve been mulling over a recent blog post by Fedora Project Leader Matthew Miller, which he wrote and published on behalf of the Fedora Council. Fedora (the KDE version) is my distribution of choice, I love using it, and I consider it the best distribution for desktop use, and not by a close margin either. As such, reading a blog post in which Fedora is announcing plans to make extensive use of &#8220;AI&#8221; was bound to make me a feel a little uneasy. Miller states &#8211; correctly &#8211; that the &#8220;AI&#8221; space as it stands right now is dominated so much by hyperbole and over-the-top nonsense that it&#8217;s hard to judge the various technologies underpinning &#8220;AI&#8221; on merit alone. He continues that he believes that stripped of all the hyperbole and techbro bullshit, there&#8217;s &#8220;something significant, powerful&#8221;, and he wants to make &#8220;Fedora Linux the best community platform for AI&#8221;. So, what exactly does that look like? In addition to the big showy LLM-based tools for chat and code generation, these advances have brought big jumps for more tailored tasks: for translation, file search, home automation, and especially for accessibility (already a key part of our strategy). For example, open source speech synthesis has long lagged behind proprietary options. Now, what we have in Fedora is not even close to the realism, nuance, and flexibility of AI-generated speech. ↫ Matthew Miller Some of these are things we can all agree are important and worthwhile, but lacking on the Linux desktop. If we can make use of technologies labelled as &#8220;AI&#8221; to improve, say, text-to-speech on Linux for those who require it for accessibility reasons, that&#8217;s universally a great thing. Translation, too, is, at its core, a form of accessibility, and if we can improve machine translations so that people who, for instance, don&#8217;t speak English gain more access to English content, or if we can make the vast libraries of knowledge locked into foreign languages accessible to more people, that&#8217;s all good news. However, Fedora aims to take its use of &#8220;AI&#8221; even further, and wants to start using it in the process of developing, making, and distributing Fedora. This is where more and more red flags are starting to pop up for me, because I don&#8217;t feel like the processes and tasks they want to inject &#8220;AI&#8221; into are the kinds of processes and tasks where you want humans taken out of the equation. We can use AI/ML as part of making the Fedora Linux OS. New tools could help with package automation and bug triage. They could note anomalies in test results and logs, maybe even help identify potential security issues. We can also create infrastructure-level features for our users. For example, package update descriptions aren’t usually very meaningful. We could automatically generate concise summaries of what’s new in each system update — not just for each package, but highlighting what’s important in the whole set, including upstream change information as well. ↫ Matthew Miller Even the tools built atop billions and billions of euros of investments by Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, Facebook, and similar juggernauts are not exactly good at what they&#8217;re supposed to do, and suck at even the most basic of tasks of providing answers to simple questions. They lie, they make stuff up, they bug out and produce nonsense, they&#8217;re racist, and so on. I don&#8217;t want any of that garbage near the process of making and updating the operating system I rely on every day. Miller laments how &#8220;AI&#8221; is currently a closed-source, black box affair, which obviously doesn&#8217;t align with Fedora&#8217;s values and goals. He doesn&#8217;t actually explain how Fedora&#8217;s use of &#8220;AI&#8221; is going to address this. They&#8217;re going to have to find ethical, open source models that are also of high quality, and that&#8217;s a lot easier said than done. Sourcing doesn&#8217;t even get a single mention in this blog post, even though I&#8217;m fairly sure that&#8217;s one of the two major issues many of us have with the current crop of &#8220;AI&#8221; tools. The blog post also completely neglects to mention the environmental cost of training these &#8220;AI&#8221; tools. It costs an insane amount of electricity to train these new tools, and with climate change ever accelerating and the destruction of our environment visible all around us, not mentioning this problem when you&#8217;re leading a project like Fedora seems disingenuous at best, and malicious at worst. While using &#8220;AI&#8221; to improve accessibility tools in Fedora and the wider Linux world is laudable, some of the other intended targets seem more worrisome, especially when you take into account that the blog post makes no mention of the two single biggest problems with &#8220;AI&#8221;: sourcing, and its environmental impact. If Fedora truly intends to fully embrace &#8220;AI&#8221;, it&#8217;s going to have to address these two problems first, because otherwise they&#8217;re just trying to latch onto the hype without really understanding the cost. And that&#8217;s not something I want to hear from the leaders of my Linux distribution.

## Framework’s software and firmware have been a mess, but it’s working on them

date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News

Framework puts a lot of effort into making its hardware easy to fix and upgrade and into making sure that hardware can stay useful down the line when it&#8217;s been replaced by something newer. But supporting that kind of reuse and recycling works best when paired with long-term software and firmware support, and on that front, Framework has been falling short. Framework will need to step up its game, especially if it wants to sell more laptops to businesses—a lucrative slice of the PC industry that Framework is actively courting. By this summer or fall, we&#8217;ll have some idea of whether its efforts are succeeding. ↫ Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica A very painful read, and I&#8217;m disappointed to learn that the software support from Framework has been so lacklustre &#8211; or non-existent, to be more accurate. Leaving severel security vulnerabilities in firmware unpatched is a disgrace, and puts users at risk, while promising but not delivering updates that will unlock faster Thunderbolt speeds is just shitty. They have to do better, especially since their pitch is all about repairability and longevity. This article has made me more weary of spending any money on Framework &#8211; not that I have the money for a new laptop, because reasons &#8211; and I feel more people will feel this way after reading this.

## Radxa ROCK 5 ITX: a first look

date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News

A couple of weeks ago I wrote about the ROCK 5 ITX coming soon and since then, samples of the Rockchip RK3588-based Radxa ROCK 5 ITX have been landing on doorsteps (or service points, screw you, UPS) of a lucky group of people and somehow I was one of those, so here’s a first look at Radxa’s latest Single Board Computer in a Mini ITX form-factor! It’s going to be a photo-heavy post and I make no apologies for that, it’s a very nice-looking PCB, with the black and gold colour scheme looking very stylish. I imagine that was a very conscious decision seeing as, as expected, they’re marketing this as a low-power desktop option and you probably don’t want a plain Jane motherboard taking pride of place in your new system, right? ↫ Bret Weber Now this &#8211; this, my friends, is exactly what the doctor ordered. I can&#8217;t wait for standard, ATX motherboard sporting ARM processors to become more common and readily available, hopefully standardised better than what we&#8217;re used to from the ARM world. I want my next (non-gaming) machines to be ARM-powered, and that means we&#8217;re going to need more of these ATX ARM boards, spanning wider performance levels.

## What If the Most Widely Used Climate Tool Doesn’t Work?

date: 2024-04-15, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTk5Mzg4MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxOTc5OTM0MH0.FxYCXXx39ZQxpvAfF20WhfBnaJQic3rTJhqK9C_EN3o/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">About six months ago, a climate scientist from Arizona State University, Stephanie Arcusa, emailed me a <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/ee/d3ee01138k" target="_blank">provocative new paper</a> she had published that warned against our growing reliance on life cycle analysis. This practice of measuring all of the emissions related to a given product or service throughout every phase of its life — from the time raw materials are extracted to eventual disposal — was going to hinder our ability to achieve net-zero emissions, she wrote. It was a busy time, and I let the message drift to the bottom of my inbox. But I couldn’t stop thinking about it.<br/></p><p>Life cycle analysis permeates the climate economy. Businesses rely on it to understand their emissions so they can work toward reducing them. The <a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/sec-climate-disclosure-rule" target="_self"><u>Securities and Exchange Commission’s climate risk disclosure rule</u></a>, which requires companies to report their emissions to investors, hinges on it. The clean hydrogen tax credit requires hydrogen producers to do <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-treasury" target="_self"><u>a version of life cycle analysis</u></a> to prove their eligibility. It is central to carbon markets, and carbon removal companies are now developing standards based on life cycle analysis to “certify” their services as carbon offset developers did before them.</p><p>At the same time, many of the fiercest debates in climate change are really debates about life cycle analysis. Should companies be held responsible for the emissions that are indirectly related to their businesses, and if so then which ones? Are carbon offsets a sham? Does using corn ethanol as a gasoline substitute reduce emissions or increase them? Scientists have repeatedly reached opposite conclusions on that one <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/16022022/corn-ethanol-gasoline-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>depending on how they accounted for the land required to grow corn</u></a> and what it might have been used for had ethanol not been an option. Though the debate plays out in calculations, it’s really a philosophical brawl.</p><p>Everybody, for the most part, knows that life cycle analysis is difficult and thorny and imprecise. But over and over, experts and critics alike assert that it can be improved. Arcusa disagrees. Life cycle analysis, she says, is fundamentally broken. “It’s a problematic and uncomfortable conclusion to arrive at,” Arcusa wrote in her email. “On the one hand, it has been the only tool we have had to make any progress on climate. On the other, carbon accounting is captured by academia and vested interests and will jeopardize global climate goals.”</p><p>When I recently revisited the paper, I learned that Arcusa and her co-authors didn’t just critique life cycle analysis, they proposed a bold alternative. Their idea is not economically or politically easy, but it also doesn’t suffer from the problems of trying to track carbon throughout the supply chain. I recently called her up to talk through it. Our conversation has been edited for clarity.</p><p><strong>Can you walk me through what the biggest issues with life cycle analysis are?</strong></p><p>So, life cycle analysis is a qualitative tool —</p><p><strong>It seems kind of counterintuitive or even controversial to call it a qualitative tool because it’s specifically trying to quantify something.</strong></p><p>I think the best analogy for LCA is that it’s a back-of-the-envelope tool. If you really could measure everything, then sure, LCA is this wonderful idea. The problem is in the practicality of being able to collect all of that data. We can’t, and that leads us to use emissions factors and average numbers, and we model this and we model that, and we get so far away from reality that we actually can’t tell if something is positive or negative in the end. </p><p>The other problem is that it’s almost entirely subjective, which makes one LCA incomparable to another LCA depending on the context, depending on the technology. And yes, there are some standardization efforts that have been going on for decades. But if you have a ruler, no matter how much you try, it’s not going to become a screwdriver. We’re trying to use this tool to quantify things and make them the same for comparison, and we can’t because of that subjectivity. </p><p>In this space where there is a lot of money to be made, it’s very easy to manipulate things one way or another to make it look a little bit better because the method is not robust. That’s really the gist of the problems here.</p><p><strong>One of the things you talk about in the paper is the way life cycle analysis is subject to different worldviews. Can you explain that? </strong></p><p>It’s mostly seen in what to include or exclude in the LCA — it can have enormous impacts on the results. I think corn ethanol is the perfect example of how tedious this can be because we still don’t have an answer, precisely for that reason. The uncertainty range of the results has shrunk and gotten bigger and shrunk and gotten bigger, and it’s like, well, we still don’t know. And now, this exact same worldview debate is playing into what should be included and not included in certification for things [like carbon removal] that are going to be sold under the guise of climate action, and that just can’t be. We’ll be forever debating whether something is true.</p><p><strong>Is this one of those things that scientists have been debating for ever, or is this argument that we should stop using life cycle analysis more of a fringe idea?</strong></p><p>I guess I would call it a fringe idea today. There’s been plenty of criticism throughout the years, even from the very beginning when it was first created. What I have seen is that there is criticism, and then there is, “But here’s how we can solve it and continue using LCA!<em><em>”</em></em> I’ve only come across one other publication that specifically said, “This is not working. This is not the right tool,”<em><em> a</em></em>nd that’s from Michael Gillenwater. He’s at the Greenhouse Gas Management Institute. He was like, “What are we doing?” There might be other folks, I just haven’t come across them. </p><p><strong>Okay, so what is the alternative to LCA that you’ve proposed in this paper?</strong></p><p>LCA targets the middle of the supply chain, and tries to attribute responsibility there. But if you think about where on the supply chain the carbon is the most well-known, it is actually at the source, at the point of origin, before it becomes an emission. At the point where it is created out of the ground is where we know how much carbon there is. If we focus on that source through a policy that requires mandatory sequestration — for every ton of carbon that is now produced, there is a ton of carbon that’s been put away through carbon removal, and the accounting happens there, before it is sold to anybody —<strong> </strong>anybody who’s now downstream of that supply chain is already carbon neutral. There is no need to track carbon all the way down to the consumer. </p><p>We know this is accurate because that is where governments already collect royalties and taxes — they want to know exactly how much is being sold. So we already do this. The big difference is that the policy would be required there instead of taxing everybody downstream. </p><p><strong>You’re saying that fossil fuel producers should be required to remove a ton of carbon from the atmosphere for every ton of carbon in the fuels they sell?</strong></p><p>Yeah, and maybe I should be more specific. They should <em><em>pay</em></em> for an equal amount of carbon to be removed from the atmosphere. In no way are we implying that a fossil carbon producer needs to also be doing the sequestration themselves.</p><p><strong>What would be the biggest challenges of implementing something like this?</strong></p><p>The ultimate challenge is convincing people that we need to be managing carbon and that this is a waste management type of system. Nobody really wants to pay for waste management, and so it needs to be regulated and demanded by some authority. </p><p><strong>What about the fact that we don’t really have the ability to remove carbon or store carbon at scale today, and may not for some time?</strong></p><p>Yes, we need to build capacity so that eventually we can match the carbon production to the carbon removal, which is why we also proposed that the liability needs to start today, not in the future. That liability is as good as a credit card debt — you actually have to pay it. It can be paid little by little every year, but the liability is here now, and not in the future.</p><p>The risk in the system that I’m describing, or even the system that is currently being deployed, is that you have counterproductive technologies that are being developed. And by counterproductive, I mean [carbon removal] technologies that are producing more emissions than they are storing, and so they’re net-positive. You can create a technology that has no intention of removing more carbon than its sequesters. The intention is just to earn money. </p><p><strong>Do you mean, like, the things that are supposed to be removing carbon from the atmosphere and sequestering it, they are using fossil fuels to do that, and end up releasing more carbon in the process?</strong></p><p>Yeah, so basically, what we show in the paper is that when we get to full carbon neutrality, the market forces alone will eliminate those kinds of technologies that are counterproductive. The problem is during the transition, these technologies can be economically viable because they are cheaper than they would be if 100% of the fossil fuel they used was carbon neutral through carbon removal. And so in order to prevent those technologies from gaming the system, we need a way to artificially make the price of fossil carbon as expensive as it would be if 100% of that fossil carbon was covered by carbon removal. </p><p>That’s where the idea of permits comes in. For every amount that I produce, I now have an instant liability, which is a permit. Each of those permits has to be matched by carbon removal. And since we don’t have enough carbon removal, we have futures and these futures represent the promise of actually doing carbon removal. </p><p><strong>What if we burn through the remaining carbon budget and we still don’t have the capacity to sequester enough carbon? </strong></p><p>Well, then we’re going into very unchartered territory. Right now we’re just mindlessly going through this thinking that if we just reduce emissions it will be good. It won’t be good.</p><p><strong>In the paper, you also argue against mitigating greenhouse gases other than carbon, and that seems pretty controversial to me. Why is that?</strong></p><p>We’re not arguing against mitigating, per se. We’re arguing against lumping everything under the same carbon accounting framework because lumping hides the difficulty in actually doing something about it. It’s not that we shouldn’t mitigate other greenhouse gases — we must. It’s just that if we separate the problem of carbon away from the problem of methane, away from the problem of nitrous oxide, or CFCs, we can tackle them more effectively. Because right now, we’re trying to do everything under the same umbrella, and that doesn’t work. We don’t tackle drinking and driving by sponsoring better tires. That’s just silly, right? We wouldn’t do that. We would tackle drinking and driving on its own, and then we would tackle better tires in a different policy. </p><p>So the argument is: Most of climate change is caused by carbon; let’s tackle that separately from the others and leave tackling methane and nitrous oxide to purposefully created programs to tackle those things. Let’s not lump the calculations altogether, hiding all the differences and hiding meaningful action.</p><p><strong>Is there still a role for life cycle analysis?</strong></p><p>You don’t want to be regulating carbon using life cycle analysis. So you can use the life cycle analysis for qualitative purposes, but we’re pretending that it is a tool that can deliver accurate results, and it just doesn’t. </p><p><strong>What has the response been like to this paper? What kind of feedback have you gotten?</strong></p><p>Stunned silence! </p><p><strong>Nobody has said anything?</strong></p><p>In private, they have. Not in public. In private, it’s been a little bit like, “I’ve always thought this, but it seemed like there was no other way.” But then in public, think about it. Everything is built on LCA. It’s now in every single climate bill out there. Every single standard. Every single consulting company is doing LCA and doing carbon footprinting for companies. It’s a huge industry, so I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised to hear nothing publicly.</p><p><strong>Yeah, I was gonna ask — I’ve been writing about the SEC rules and this idea that companies should start reporting their emissions to their investors, and that would all be based on LCA. There’s a lot of buy-in for that idea across the climate movement.</strong></p><p>Yeah, but there’s definitely a fine line with make-believe. I think in many instances, we kid ourselves thinking that we’re going to have numbers that we can hang our hats on. In many instances we will not, and they will be challenged. And so at that point, what’s the point?</p><p><strong>One thing I hear when I talk to people about this is, well, having an estimate is better than not having anything, or, don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good, or, we can just keep working to make them better and better. Why not?</strong></p><p>I mean, I wouldn’t say don’t try. But when it comes to actually enforcing anything, it’s going to be extremely hard to prove a number. You could just be stuck in litigation for a long time and still not have an answer.</p><p>I don’t know, to me it just seems like an endless debate while time is ticking and we will just feel good because we’ll have thought we measured everything. But we’re still not doing anything. </p>

## Gun supervisor gets 18 months in prison for fatal movie set shooting by Alec Baldwin

date: 2024-04-15, from: VOA News USA

santa fe, new mexico — A movie weapons supervisor was sentenced to 18 months in prison in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer by Alec Baldwin on the set of the Western film "Rust," during a hearing Monday in which tearful family members and friends gave testimonials that included calls for justice and a punishment that would instill greater accountability for safety on film sets.


Movie armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed was convicted in March by a jury on a charge of involuntary manslaughter in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and has been held for more than a month at a county jail on the outskirts of Santa Fe.


Prosecutors blamed Gutierrez-Reed for unwittingly bringing live ammunition onto the set of "Rust" where it was expressly prohibited and for failing to follow basic gun safety protocols.


Gutierrez-Reed was unsuccessful in her plea for a lesser sentencing, telling the judge she was not the monster that people have made her out to be and that she had tried to do her best on the set despite not having "proper time, resources and staffing."


Baldwin, the lead actor and co-producer for "Rust," was pointing a gun at Hutchins during a rehearsal on a movie set outside Santa Fe in October 2021 when the revolver went off, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza.


Baldwin has pleaded not guilty to a charge of involuntary manslaughter. He is scheduled for trial in July at a courthouse in Santa Fe.


The sentence against Gutierrez-Reed was delivered by New Mexico Judge Mary Marlowe Summer, who is overseeing proceedings against Baldwin. The judge said anything less than the maximum sentence would not be appropriate given that Gutierrez-Reed's recklessness amounted to a serious violent offense.


"You were the armorer, the one that stood between a safe weapon and a weapon that could kill someone," the judge told Gutierrez-Reed. "You alone turned a safe weapon into a lethal weapon. But for you, Ms. Hutchins would be alive, a husband would have his partner and a little boy would have his mother."


 




Gutierrez-Reed teared up as Hutchins' agent, Craig Mizrahi, spoke about the cinematographer's creativity and described her as a rising star in Hollywood. He said it was a chain of events that led to Hutchins' death and that had the armorer been doing her job, that chain would have been broken.


Los Angeles-based attorney Gloria Allred read a statement by Hutchins' mother, Olga Solovey, who said her life had been split in two and that time didn't heal, rather it only prolonged her pain and suffering. A video of a tearful Solovey, who lives in Ukraine, also was played for the court.


"It's the hardest thing to lose a child. There's no words to describe," Solovey said in her native language.


Defense attorneys for Gutierrez-Reed requested leniency in sentencing — including a possible conditional discharge that would avoid further jail time and leave an adjudication of guilt off her record if certain conditions are met.


Gutierrez-Reed was acquitted at trial of allegations she tampered with evidence in the "Rust" investigation. She also has pleaded not guilty to a separate felony charge that she allegedly carried a gun into a bar in Santa Fe where firearms are prohibited.


Defense attorneys have highlighted Gutierrez-Reed's relatively young age "and the devastating effect a felony will have on her life going forward."


They said the 26-year-old will forever be affected negatively by intense publicity associated with her prosecution in parallel with an A-list actor, and has suffered from anxiety, fear and depression as a result.


Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey urged the judge to impose the maximum prison sentence and designate Gutierrez-Reed as a "serious violent offender" to limit her eligibility for a sentence reduction later, describing the defendant's behavior on the set of "Rust" as exceptionally reckless.


Defense attorneys argued Monday that Gutierrez-Reed was remorseful and had breakdowns over Hutchins' death. They also pointed to systemic problems that led to the shooting.


"Rust" assistant director and safety coordinator Dave Halls last year pleaded no contest to negligent handling of a firearm and completed a sentence of six months unsupervised probation. "Rust" props master Sarah Zachry, who shared some responsibilities over firearms on the set of "Rust," signed an agreement with prosecutors to avoid prosecution in return with her cooperation.

## Ethiopia's Sisay Lemma, Kenya's Hellen Obiri win Boston Marathon

date: 2024-04-15, from: VOA News USA

BOSTON — Sisay Lemma scorched the first half of the Boston Marathon course on Monday, setting a record pace to build a lead of more than half of a mile. 


Then the weather heated up, and the 34-year-old Ethiopian slowed down. 


After running alone for most of the morning, Lemma held on down Boylston Street to finish in 2 hours, 6 minutes, 17 seconds — the 10th fastest time in the race's 128-year history. Lemma dropped to the pavement and rolled onto his back, smiling, after crossing the finish line. 


"Until halfway through I was running very hard and very good. But after that it was getting harder and harder," said Lemma, who failed to finish twice and came in 30th in three previous Boston attempts. "Several times I've dropped out of the race before. But today I won, so I've redeemed myself." 


 




Hellen Obiri defended her title, outkicking Sharon Lokedi on Boylston Street to finish in 2:27:37 and win by eight seconds; two-time Boston champion Edna Kiplagat completed the Kenyan sweep, finishing another 36 seconds back. 


Obiri also won New York last fall and is among the favorites for the Paris Olympics. She is the sixth woman to win back-to-back in Boston and the first since Catherine "the Great" Ndereba won four in six years from 2000 to '05. 


"Defending the title was not easy. Since Boston started, it's only six women. So I said, 'Can I be one of them? If you want to be one of them, you have to work extra hard,'" she said. "And I'm so happy because I'm now one of them. I'm now in the history books in Boston." 


Lemma, the 2021 London champion, arrived in Boston with the fastest time in the field — just the fourth person ever to break 2:02:00 when he won in Valencia last year. And he showed it on the course Monday, separating himself from the pack in Ashland and opening a lead of more than half of a mile. 


Lemma ran the first half in 1:00:19 — 99 seconds faster than Geoffrey Mutai's course record pace in 2011, when his 2:03:02 was the fastest marathon in history. Fellow Ethiopian Mohamed Esa closed the gap through the last few miles, finishing second by 41 seconds; two-time defending champion Evans Chebet was third. 


Each winner collected a gilded olive wreath and $150,000 from a total prize purse that topped $1 million for the first time. 


On a day when sunshine and temperatures rising into the mid-60s left the runners reaching for water — to drink, and to dump over their heads — Obiri ran with an unusually large lead pack of 15 through Brookline before breaking away in the final few miles. 


 




Emma Bates of Boulder, Colorado, finished 12th — her second straight year as the top American. Again, she found herself leading the race through the 30-kilometer mark, slapping hands as she ran past the Wellesley College students chanting her name before fading on the way out of Heartbreak Hill. 


"I thought last year was crazy loud, but this year surpassed that completely," Bates said. "It was such a nice day for the spectators. Not so nice for the runners; it was pretty hot." 


CJ Albertson of Fresno, California, was the top American man in seventh, his second top-10 finish. 


Switzerland's Marcel Hug righted himself after crashing into a barrier when he took a turn too fast and still coasted to a course record in the men's wheelchair race. It was his seventh Boston win and his 14th straight major marathon victory. 


Hug already had a four-minute lead about 18 miles in when he reached the landmark firehouse turn in Newton, where the course heads onto Commonwealth Avenue on its way to Heartbreak Hill. He spilled into the fence, flipping sideways onto his left wheel, but quickly restored himself. 


"It was my fault," Hug said. "I had too much weight, too much pressure from above to my steering, so I couldn't steer." 


 




Hug finished in 1:15:33, winning by 5:04 and breaking his previous course record by 1:33. Britain's Eden Rainbow-Cooper, 22, won the women's wheelchair race in 1:35:11 for her first major marathon victory; she is the third-youngest woman to win the Boston wheelchair race. 


The otherwise sleepy New England town of Hopkinton celebrated its 100th anniversary as the starting line for the world's oldest and most prestigious marathon, sending off a field of 17 former champions and nearly 30,000 other runners on its way. Near the finish on Boylston Street 26.2 miles (42.2 kilometers) away, officials observed the anniversary of the 2013 bombing that killed three and wounded hundreds more. 


Sunny skies and minimal wind greeted the runners, with temperatures in the 40s as they gathered in Hopkinton rising to 69 as the stragglers crossed the finish line in the afternoon. As the field went through Natick, the fourth of eight cities and towns on the route, athletes splashed water on themselves to cool off. 


"We couldn't ask for a better day," former New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, the grand marshal, said before climbing into an electric car that would carry him along the course. "The city of Boston always comes out to support, no matter the event. The weather is perfection, the energy is popping." 


 




The festivities began around 6 a.m., when race director Dave McGillivray sent about 30 Massachusetts National Guard members off. Lt. Col. Paula Reichert Karsten, one of the marchers, said she wanted to be part of a "quintessential Massachusetts event." 


The start line was painted to say "100 years in Hopkinton," commemorating the 1924 move from Ashland to Hopkinton to conform to the official Olympic Marathon distance. The announcer welcomed the gathering crowds to the "sleepy little town of Hopkinton, 364 days of the year." 


"In Hopkinton, it's probably the coolest thing about the town," said Maggie Agosto, a 16-year-old resident who went to the start line with a friend to watch the race. 


The annual race on Patriots' Day, the state holiday that commemorates the start of the Revolutionary War, also fell on One Boston Day, when the city remembers the victims of the 2013 finish line bombings. Before the race, bagpipes accompanied Gov. Maura Healey, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and members of the victims' families as they laid a pair of wreaths at the sites of the explosions.

You can assign specific commands or functionalities to different hand gestures, allowing for hands-free interaction with your computer. ↫ GestureX GitHub page I personally see no use for any of this, but I&#8217;m sure there are some interesting accessibility uses for technology like this, which in and of itself make it a worthwhile endeavour to work on. Do note, though, that this is all beta, so there&#8217;s bound to be issues.

## Seeing the Solar Eclipse from 223,000 Miles Away

date: 2024-04-15, from: NASA breaking news

NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) captured the April 8, 2024, solar eclipse from hundreds of thousands of miles away. The camera suite aboard the LRO usually retrieves high resolution black and white images of the Moon’s surface; these images provide knowledge of polar illumination conditions, identify potential resources, hazards, and enable safe landing site selection.

## Apple’s mysterious fisheye projection

date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News

If you’ve read my first post about&#160;Spatial Video, the second about&#160;Encoding Spatial Video, or if you’ve used my&#160;command-line tool, you may recall a mention of Apple’s mysterious “fisheye” projection format. Mysterious because they’ve documented a&#160;CMProjectionType.fisheye&#160;enumeration with no elaboration, they stream their immersive Apple TV+ videos in this format, yet they’ve provided no method to produce or playback third-party content using this projection type. Additionally, the format is undocumented, they haven’t responded to an open question on the Apple Discussion Forums asking for more detail, and they didn’t cover it in their WWDC23 sessions. As someone who has experience in this area – and a relentless curiosity – I’ve spent time digging-in to Apple’s fisheye projection format, and this post shares what I’ve learned. ↫ Mike Swanson There is just so much cool technology crammed into the Vision Pro, from the crazy displays down to, apparently, the encoding format for spatial video. Too bad Apple seems to have forgotten that a technology is not a product, as even the most ardent Apple supporterts &#8211; like John Gruber, or the hosts of ATP &#8211; have stated their Vision Pro devices are lying unused, collecting dust, just months after launch.

## US citizen arrested in Moscow on drug charges appears in court

date: 2024-04-15, from: VOA News USA

Moscow — A U.S. citizen arrested on drug charges in Moscow amid soaring Russia-U.S. tensions over Ukraine appeared in court on Monday.


Robert Woodland Romanov is facing charges of trafficking large amounts of illegal drugs as part of an organized group — a criminal offense punishable by up to 20 years in prison. He was remanded into custody in January, and the trial began in the Ostankino District Court in late March. A new court hearing is scheduled for next week.


In January, the U.S. State Department said it was aware of reports of the recent detention of a U.S. citizen and noted that it "has no greater priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas," but refrained from further comment, citing privacy considerations. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow issued a similar statement at the time.


Russian media noted that the name of the accused matches that of a U.S. citizen interviewed by the popular daily Komsomolskaya Pravda in 2020.


In the interview, the man said that he was born in the Perm region in the Ural Mountains in 1991 and was adopted by an American couple when he was two. He said that he traveled to Russia to find his Russian mother and eventually met her in a TV show in Moscow.


The man told Komsomolskaya Pravda that he liked living in Russia and decided to move there. The newspaper reported that he settled in the town of Dolgoprudny just outside Moscow and was working as an English teacher at a local school.


Arrests of Americans in Russia have become increasingly common as relations between Moscow and Washington sink to Cold War lows. Washington accuses Moscow of targeting its citizens and using them as political bargaining chips, but Russian officials insist they all broke the law.


Some have been exchanged for Russians held in the U.S., while for others, the prospects of being released in a swap are less clear.

## Why Oil Traders Are Not Freaking Out Today

So far on Monday, the Brent crude oil benchmark is hovering around $89.50 a barrel, a 1-ish% dip for the day.</p><p><span></span>This has been the story of the conflict so far: While oil prices rose following Hamas’s October 7 attack on Southern Israel and the beginning of Israel’s invasion of Gaza, they’re now back to where they were for much of September, and are down substantially from their summer 2022 highs. </p><p>It remains to be seen how, exactly, Israel will respond to the <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/04/15/israel-iran-attack-missiles-retaliation" target="_blank">attack by Iranian drones</a>, but oil markets are still largely relaxed. By the end of last week, explained Eurasia Group analyst Greg Brew, the markets had already “priced in” an Iranian attack, pushing prices above $90.</p><p>Brew pointed to both the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/14/politics/biden-netanyahu-israel-iran-response/index.html" target="_blank"><u>United States</u></a> and <a href="https://newyork.mfa.ir/portal/NewsView/743409/Ambassadors-Statement-Before-UNSC-Regarding-Irans-Legitimate-Right-to-Self-Defense-against-Israeli-Regime" target="_blank"><u>Iran</u></a> indicating that “further escalation is being actively discouraged” as one cause for the market’s relative relaxation so far today.</p><p>“The market is down a bit, though there is still a lot of anxiety regarding whether Israel’s response to the attack creates more escalatory pressure,” he told me. “So we’re still in a wait-and-see pattern.”</p><p>Despite the escalation, oil markets apparently still don’t see the conflict spinning out of control. “Crude essentially unchanged to start the week,” oil analyst Rory Johnston tweeted Sunday. “Iran’s reaction perfectly priced in.”</p>

## Why good external SSDs are faster with Apple silicon

date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News

After several days testing the latest Express 1M2 enclosure from OWC, I have changed my recommendations for the best external SSDs. Previously I had chosen the relatively reliable Thunderbolt 3 up to 3 GB/s, even though few drives ever seemed capable of achieving that up to. If you’re still needing good performance with an Intel Mac, that makes sense. But if you need best performance with an Apple silicon Mac, you’re far better off with a high-quality USB 40Gbps enclosure such as OWC’s Express 1M2, which should reliably return over 3 GB/s even through a compatible hub. I much prefer the word over to up to. ↫ Howard Oakley If you have an Apple Silicon Mac, and you&#8217;re looking for an external drive &#8211; this is some good advice to follow.

## Busting the “immigrants as job takers” myth

date: 2024-04-15, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>On today&#8217;s program, we&#8217;re taking a closer look at immigration and entrepreneurship. Immigrants are more likely to start a new company than U.S.-born citizens, studies show. And those new businesses need to make hires — turns out, immigrant entrepreneurs are associated with a net gain in jobs. We&#8217;ll discuss. Also, a boost in the Internal Revenue Service budget seems to be making a difference, and investors respond to rising tensions in the Middle East.</p>

	Tesla has reportedly laid off “more than 10%” of its global workforce, <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VWmB2J3mxv0WW1BZYbz2wKHKWW20x2Jc5cXxHwN880g4T3qn9gW95jsWP6lZ3q3W19TJn-8J8DrHW7Rv7mz6wmsv2W2z568j94_Mp0W7LHG_4756fl2W5qwN2p2gGMBWW1P6dQx5nBxHZW2-Cx174ZNRmsVNBYxx2_L2H_W5vWhRx582NyVW8CB2PP247cgKW2H12kD6WzW-QVsP7hB1KtJ-fW3YkBRP8WT7sGN6mJR3WY5T2vW3-Dtyd1m8HyDW1w7TXp3qNqFPW1BqjM06plhDMW1mDd4_7VDZysW3Dqf2K8XS4j4W2mVVWy1tL21kW2KNVHT5KmHcyW8Z9G077gLds6W7ZB1GG5qjb1CVm6Bct5q1l11W8ycGXz4bGkZ4W3D-zSQ35vkdGW5TMrdP3FR47LW8GTH_06X5W0_W1qjqhp7N9wxvW8sNSMn8Gs0nLf3WtfcF04" target="_blank">according to Jameson Dow</a> at <em><em>Electrek</em></em>. In an internal company-wide email, CEO Elon Musk said “this will enable us to be lean, innovative and hungry for the next growth phase cycle.” The exact headcount isn’t clear but Dow calculates a 10% cut would bring the number of workers newly out of a job to about 14,000. The news wasn’t unexpected – employees had been whispering about potential layoffs for a few weeks, and their angst was fueled by the announcement last Thursday that Cybertruck production shifts at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Texas would be shortened, starting today. Dow notes the layoffs will hurt morale, “which is a shame, because we do need Tesla to keep pushing things forward, and to keep attracting the best and brightest.”

## New Lattice Cryptanalytic Technique

date: 2024-04-15, updated: 2024-04-14, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>A <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/555">new paper</a> presents a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for solving certain hard lattice problems. This could be a big deal for post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, since many of them base their security on hard lattice problems.</p>
<p>A few things to note. One, this paper has not yet been peer reviewed. As <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/111385/polynomial-time-quantum-algorithms-for-lattice-problems">this comment</a> points out: &#8220;We had already some cases where efficient quantum algorithms for lattice problems were discovered, but they turned out <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/41731/new-quantum-attack-on-lattices-or-shor-strikes-again?rq=1">not being correct</a> or only worked for <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/95187/what-does-the-work-an-efficient-quantum-algorithm-for-lattice-problems-achievin">simple special cases</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two, this is a quantum algorithm, which means that it has not been tested. There is a wide gulf between quantum algorithms in theory and in practice. And until we can actually code and test these algorithms, we should be suspicious of their speed and complexity claims...</p>

## New York Will Soon Get Congestion Pricing — After a 150,000-Year Wait

date: 2024-04-15, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTk3NDg3Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NDUxNTUxMX0.FHb9xyiSZMHP4Jr-bOh5xQ5hIUoEbd4uHo6EBIXvMRo/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">In late March, the board that oversees New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/the-winners-losers-of-nycs-congestion-pricing-plan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cast a final vote</u></a> to implement congestion pricing. If the plan survives some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/03/nyregion/nj-congestion-pricing-federal-court.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>last-ditch lawsuits</u></a>, drivers will soon have to cough up $15 to travel into Lower Manhattan during rush hours. The MTA will get <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-27/congestion-pricing-in-new-york-city-how-the-new-system-would-work" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>billions every year</u></a> to make capital improvements, the air will be markedly cleaner, the streets notably less congested, and a proposal that was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/nyregion/23mayorcnd.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>first pitched</u></a> by former Mayor Michael Bloomberg 17 years ago will have finally been realized.</p>
<p>“I often wonder what our system would have been like if we passed it back in 2008,” MTA board member Haeda Mihaltses, a veteran of the Bloomberg administration, mused just before she cast her vote in favor.</p>
<p>The price of nearly two decades of procrastination over doing something to alleviate the most densely-populated, <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/03/13/nyc-drivers-travel-just-12-mph-during-rush-hour/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>traffic-snarled place</u></a> in North America is, indeed, unfathomably high. There’s the billions of dollars of mass transit infrastructure we missed out on, the billions <a href="https://leading.business.columbia.edu/main-pillar-climate-change-sustainability/economy-policy/congestion-pricing-new-york" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>spent on health care</u></a> from breathing in dirty air. </p>
<p>And then there’s the most precious resource of all. According to <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/12/01/komanoff-imho-tmrb-is-a-ok" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one calculation</u></a> from transport economist and congestion pricing advocate Charles Komanoff, the plan the MTA adopted last month will save drivers, bus passengers, and subway riders a combined 225,000 hours every single day. Here’s a fun thought experiment: If New York had adopted this plan back in 2008, we could have saved ourselves a combined 1,314,000,000 hours, or 150,000 years. </p>
<p>How could implementing something so obviously necessary and routine — anyone who has paid to camp in a National Park or drive on the New Jersey Turnpike understands the concept — take so long? What does it say about how we govern? And what can we learn from it?</p>
<p>“I think it is fair to say that whatever roadblock congestion pricing could have hit, it hit,” Rachael Fauss, a policy director and MTA researcher for the good government group <a href="https://reinventalbany.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Reinvent Albany</u>, told me</a>. "It was the worst case scenario of timelines if you were to project out: What are the things that could delay this?"</p>
<p>Some of the delays were deliberate: It’s hard enough for lawmakers to summon the courage to raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires, so charging drivers money for something that used to be “free,” to fund a transit agency that often conjures delayed trains and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-23/in-nyc-subway-a-case-study-in-runaway-transit-construction-costs?embedded-checkout=true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>decades-long boondoggles</u></a> in the public’s imagination, was always going to require a fortitude that is in chronically short supply in Albany.<strong> </strong>When then-New York Governor Andrew Cuomo pushed to pass congestion pricing in 2019, he and his fellow lawmakers wrote into the actual bill that the tolling scheme <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/04/02/politicians-put-off-setting-congestion-pricing-fee-until-after-2020-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>couldn’t be announced</u></a> for a year and a half — until after the 2020 election. The same politicians who were supposedly brave enough to vote congestion pricing into law didn’t want anything to do with putting that law into practice.</p>
<p>Then there were the bureaucratic delays. The COVID pandemic, of course, redirected much of the government and forced the MTA into survival mode as subway ridership <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/08/climate/nyc-transit-covid.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dropped 90%</u></a>; suddenly the agency’s most important work was to <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2020/09/13/railing-over-mta-one-track-mind-on-federal-bailout-hope/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>coordinate</u></a> lifesaving bailouts from the <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/feds-send-mta-6-billion-keep-secret-sauce-flowing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>federal</u></a> and <a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2023/02/01/hochul-proposes-mta-bailout-with-payroll-tax-hike--casino-revenue" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>state governments</u></a>. Then the Trump administration <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-congestion-pricing-cuomo-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>slow-walked</u></a> the answer to a key question: Because the congestion pricing plan involved placing tolls on roads built with federal funding, the state needed a sign-off from the federal Department of Transportation. But was congestion pricing the kind of massive infrastructure project that, under the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/nepa/national-environmental-policy-act-review-process" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>National Environmental Policy Act</u></a> of 1969, required an exhaustive Environmental Impact Statement? Could it pass NEPA review with a less thorough Environmental Assessment? Or, given that nothing was actually being built up or torn down, could it be exempt from these reviews altogether?</p>
<p>Two years after the congestion pricing law passed, and months after the plan was supposed to go into effect in early 2021, the newly installed Biden administration finally <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2021/03/30/this-is-happening-feds-lets-mta-do-simpler-environmental-review-of-congestion-pricing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>asked</u></a> for the middle option, an Environmental Assessment, which the MTA <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2020/11/19/congestion-pricing-can-still-happen-in-2021-but-there-are-a-lot-of-ifs-including-president-biden/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>initially said</u></a> could be done in a matter of months. In actuality, that timeline stretched to 16 months and produced a <a href="https://new.mta.info/project/CBDTP/environmental-assessment-2022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>4,000-page behemoth</u></a> that some <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/03/28/the-toll-of-history-mta-board-approves-15-congestion-pricing-fee" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>experts noted</u></a> was more comprehensive than the average EIS. </p>
<p>Seemingly nothing escaped the MTA’s scrutiny — it even looked at how congestion pricing would <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/06/10/opinion-pete-buttigieg-is-failing-new-york-and-the-country-on-congestion-pricing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>affect traffic in the Philadelphia suburbs</u></a> (not all that much). The results were <a href="https://www.masstransitmag.com/management/article/21277061/environmental-assessment-for-new-york-mtas-proposed-congestion-pricing-program-released" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>not exactly shocking</u></a>: Tolling vehicles entering Lower Manhattan below 60th Street would result in up to 20% fewer vehicles in the Central Business District, improving air quality while also generating $1 billion in revenue for public transit, which could then be used to secure up to $15 billion in bonds. After more than 50 public meetings and 25,000 written comments (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/03/nyregion/nj-congestion-pricing-federal-court.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>60% in favor</u></a> of the plan), the Biden administration <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/05/05/federal-government-gives-mta-final-blessing-to-congestion-pricing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>produced</u></a> a “finding of no significant impact,” meaning that congestion pricing wouldn’t negatively affect the economy, the environment, or the roads.</p>
<p>There was at least one notable benefit that came from doing such a comprehensive, time-intensive review: The MTA found that congestion pricing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/12/nyregion/nyc-congestion-pricing-manhattan-bronx.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>could cause an increase</u></a> in truck traffic to the South Bronx for drivers looking to toll shop, which in turn prompted the agency to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/28/nyregion/mta-congestion-pricing-pollution-bronx.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>allocate $200 million to alleviate pollution</u></a> in some of New York City’s poorest neighborhoods, which have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/04/new-york-south-bronx-minorities-pollution-inequity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>shamefully high asthma rates</u></a> that <a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/centers/columbia-center-childrens-environmental-health/our-research/health-effects/asthma" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mostly affect Black and Latine New Yorkers</u></a>.<strong> </strong>"Is it congestion pricing’s job to remedy those problems? Maybe not," Fauss, of Reinvent Albany, said. "But is it a really important way to correct some past wrongs? Yeah, absolutely."</p>
<p>The MTA’s thoroughness may help protect it from the <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/nj-sues-congestion-pricing-wah-wah" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bad faith lawsuits</u></a> that have been <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/lawsuit-congestion-pricing-teachers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>filed</u></a> to try and shut down the license plate readers before they go live on June 15. But we’re in the midst of a climate crisis. Why should a 54-year-old law designed to prevent overeager developers from doing things like demolishing neighborhoods to build highways discourage cities and states from enacting dynamic, flexible solutions to cut pollution created by those highways — <em><em>and</em></em> fund public transit at the same time? And why should a review of a plan that requires no concrete, no demolition — no actual infrastructure — take three years?</p>
<p>The biggest hurdle congestion pricing had to overcome might have been psychological. Let’s call it "car brain": Even though <a href="https://new.mta.info/document/110766" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>85%</u></a> of commuters who travel into the Central Business District take mass transit, for years, lawmakers and congestion pricing opponents have argued (and in the case of the current New York City Mayor Eric Adams, <em><em>still</em></em> <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/06/metro/eric-adams-adrienne-adams-distance-themselves-from-mtas-15-congestion-toll/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>argue</u></a>) that charging people to drive into Lower Manhattan was a kind of attack on the middle class. In a city where valuable street real estate <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/nyc-might-charge-for-parking" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has been converted into free parking</u></a>, congestion pricing was portrayed as profaning the sacred rights of "regular" New Yorkers — never mind the fact that just <a href="https://www.cssny.org/news/entry/congestion-pricing-outer-borough-new-yorkers-poverty-data-analysis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2% of New York’s working poor</u></a> will end up paying the tolls. Driving your car wherever you please, it turns out, is <a href="https://blog.tstc.org/2017/04/21/car-free-new-york-city/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>quite expensive</u></a>.</p>
<p>“Elected officials are facing the world from the front seat of a car, whether they’re driving or being driven,” Danny Pearlstein, the policy and communications director at <a href="https://www.ridersalliance.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Riders Alliance</u></a>, one of the most forceful proponents of congestion pricing, told me. Pearlstein added that “bureaucrats who drive to work” probably contributed to the Biden administration’s slow-walking of the approval process, or so he suspects. “They were very cautious about doing something that alters not just, you know, air patterns, or patterns of inequity, but actual commutes,” Pearlstein said.</p>
<p>As a reporter who has covered congestion pricing for nearly a decade, I have learned never to underestimate the power of “car brain” on public policy. As a New Yorker who lives steps from the entrance of the Williamsburg Bridge on the Lower East Side, who watches mothers push strollers through oceans of hot, heavy steel boxes belching poisonous gasses driven by people on a hair trigger, and who has seen our leaders pretend that this is New York, that we are too exceptional to change, I cannot help but go about my day, doing my best to tune out the incessant honking, feeling like the dog engulfed in flames: “<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-is-fine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>This is fine</u></a>.”</p>
<p>That it took transportation advocates, regional planners, and forward-looking politicians nearly 20 years to enact congestion pricing in New York City — the U.S. municipality perhaps most amenable to it because of its housing density and excellent mass transit system — reveals the daunting task of weaning Americans off the automobile. More than three-quarters of us <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/05/commute-america-sustainability-cars/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>drive our own personal cars</u></a> to our jobs.</p>
<p>“The only thing that’s going to change the fact that the overwhelming majority of Americans drive to work is not permitting reforms to programs like congestion pricing. It’s permitting reforms to allow dense housing development in metropolitan areas across the country,” Pearlstein said. </p>
<p>“It’s a little bit like a Marxian analysis,” he mused. The crisis must come to a head in order to overthrow the status quo. “In order to adopt congestion pricing, you first have to exacerbate congestion significantly by condensing your built environment.”</p>

## Tax Day reveals a major split in how Joe Biden and Donald Trump would govern

date: 2024-04-15, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Tax Day reveals a major split in how Joe Biden and Donald Trump would govern: The presidential candidates have conflicting ideas about how much to reveal about their own finances and the best ways to boost the economy through tax policy.


Biden, the sitting Democratic president, plans to release his income tax returns on Monday, the IRS filing deadline. And on Tuesday, he is scheduled to deliver a speech in Scranton, Pennsylvania, about why the wealthy should pay more in taxes to reduce the federal deficit and help fund programs for the poor and middle class.


Biden is proud to say that he was largely without money for much of his decades-long career in public service, unlike Trump, who inherited hundreds of millions of dollars from his father and used his billionaire status to launch a TV show and later a presidential campaign.


“For 36 years, I was listed as the poorest man in Congress,” Biden told donors in California in February. “Not a joke.”


In 2015, Trump declared as part of his candidacy, “I'm really rich.”


The Republican former president has argued that voters have no need to see his tax data and that past financial disclosures are more than sufficient. He maintains that keeping taxes low for the wealthy will supercharge investment and lead to more jobs, while tax hikes would crush an economy still recovering from inflation that hit a four-decade peak in 2022.


“Biden wants to give the IRS even more cash by proposing the largest tax hike on the American people in history when they are already being robbed by his record-high inflation crisis,” said Karoline Leavitt, press secretary for the Trump campaign.


The split goes beyond an ideological difference to a very real challenge for whoever triumphs in the November election. At the end of 2025, many of the tax cuts that Trump signed into law in 2017 will expire — setting up an avalanche of choices about how much people across the income spectrum should pay as the national debt is expected to climb to unprecedented levels.


Including interest costs, extending all the tax breaks could add another $3.8 trillion to the national debt through 2033, according to an analysis last year by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.


Biden would like to keep the majority of the tax breaks, based on his pledge that no one earning less than $400,000 will have to pay more. But he released a budget proposal this year with tax increases on the wealthy and corporations that would raise $4.9 trillion in revenues and trim forecasted deficits by $3.2 trillion over 10 years.


Still, he's telling voters that he's all for letting the Trump-era tax cuts lapse.


“Does anyone here think the tax code is fair? Raise your hand,” Biden said Tuesday at a speech in Washington's Union Station to a crowd predisposed to dislike Trump's broad tax cuts that helped many in the middle class but disproportionately favored wealthier households.


“It added more to the national debt than any presidential term in history," Biden continued. "And it’s due to expire next year. And guess what? I hope to be president because it expires — it’s going to stay expired.”


Trump has called for higher tariffs on foreign-made goods, which are taxes that could hit consumers in the form of higher prices. But his campaign is committed to tax cuts while promising that a Trump presidency would reduce a national debt that has risen for decades, including during his Oval Office tenure.


"When President Trump is back in the White House, he will advocate for more tax cuts for all Americans and reinvigorate America’s energy industry to bring down inflation, lower the cost of living, and pay down our debt,” Leavitt said.


Most economists say Trump’s tax cuts could not generate enough growth to pay down the national debt. An analysis released Friday by Oxford Economics found that a “full-blown Trump” policy with tax cuts, higher tariffs and blocking immigration would slow growth and increase inflation.


Among Biden's proposals is a “billionaire minimum income tax” that would apply a minimum rate of 25% on households with a net worth of at least $100 million.


The tax would directly target billionaires such as Trump, who refused to release his personal taxes as presidents have traditionally done. But six years of his tax returns were released in 2022 by Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee.


In 2018, Trump earned more than $24 million and paid about 4% of that in federal income taxes. The congressional panel also found that the IRS delayed legally mandated audits of Trump during his presidency, with the panel concluding the audit process was "dormant, at best."


Biden has publicly released more than two decades of his tax returns. In 2022, he and his wife, Jill, made $579,514 and paid nearly 24% of that in federal income taxes, more than double the rate paid by Trump.


Trump has maintained that his tax records are complicated because of his use of various tax credits and past business losses, which in some cases have allowed him to avoid taxes. He also previously declined to release his tax returns under the claim that the IRS was auditing him for pre-presidential filings.


His finances recently received a boost from the stock market debut of Trump Media, which controls Trump's preferred social media outlet, Truth Social. Share prices initially surged, adding billions of dollars to Trump's net worth, but investors have since soured on the company and shares by Friday were down more than 50% from their peak.


The former president is also on the hook for $542 million due to legal judgments in a civil fraud case and penalties owed to the writer E. Jean Carroll because of statements made by Trump that damaged her reputation after she accused him of sexual assault.


In the civil fraud case, New York Judge Arthur Engoron looked at the financial records of the Trump Organization and concluded after looking at the inflated assets that “the frauds found here leap off the page and shock the conscience.”

## US, Israel say coalition achieved ‘spectacular defeat’ of Iran’s attack

date: 2024-04-15, from: VOA News USA

The United States and Israel say they achieved a “spectacular defeat” over an Iranian aerial attack that sent 300 munitions – more than 100 of them ballistic missiles – to Israel on Saturday. But as Sunday dawned in both places, a bigger question rose on the horizon: What happens next in this six-month conflict that threatens to envelop the Middle East? VOA White House correspondent Anita Powell reports from Washington.

In technology, it doesn't happen, we don't even look at each others software.

Before long there won't be any of us left, everyone will see sports as a business, an obsession, or their downfall, because you can't win at gambling, we all know that. The whole tribal thing about sports is broken by integrated gambling, it suggests many of us, maybe eventually most of us, are here not for love of team, rather they're feeding an addiction.

## US suggests Israel need not retaliate against Iran

date: 2024-04-15, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Top officials in Washington are attempting to avoid a widening war in the Middle East after Iran launched an unprecedented attack on Israel with explosive drones and missiles.


“There need to be some consequences here,” said a senior U.S. official briefing reporters Sunday afternoon on the condition of not being named.


But U.S. President Joe Biden, in his latest conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, “made very clear to the prime minister last night that we do have to think carefully and strategically about risks of escalation,” especially in view of the attack causing only light damage and no significant casualties, the official said.


Israeli officials insist there will be a response, but the country’s war Cabinet appears divided on how and when.




If Israel retaliates, it would be doing it alone.


“We would not envision ourselves participating in such a thing,” replied the senior administration official when asked whether the United States would participate in any military response to the Iranian attack.


It was an “incredible military achievement” by Israel, the United States and other partners in repelling “more than 300 drones and missiles” launched by Iran, according to White House national security spokesperson John Kirby.


US Central Command says its forces, supported by US European Command destroyers, on Saturday and on Sunday morning "successfully engaged and destroyed more than 80 one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicles (OWA UAV) and at least six ballistic missiles intended to strike Israel from Iran and Yemen. This includes a ballistic missile on its launcher vehicle and seven UAVs destroyed on the ground in Iranian-backed Houthi controlled areas of Yemen prior to their launch."


U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in a statement late Saturday, said the explosive aircraft and missiles were launched from the territories of Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen.


“We call on Iran to immediately halt any further attacks, including from its proxy forces, and to deescalate tensions,” Austin said. “We do not seek conflict with Iran, but we will not hesitate to act to protect our forces and support the defense of Israel.”


He spoke by phone Sunday for the third time during the weekend with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.


Biden convened a hastily arranged video conference Sunday of leaders of the Group of Seven nations to coordinate a united diplomatic response to the Iranian attack.


“With its actions, Iran has further stepped toward the destabilization of the region and risks provoking an uncontrollable regional escalation. This must be avoided,” the G7 leaders said in a group statement issued after their meeting. “We will continue to work to stabilize the situation and avoid further escalation. In this spirit, we demand that Iran and its proxies cease their attacks, and we stand ready to take further measures now and in response to further destabilizing initiatives.”


Biden spoke by phone with Netanyahu on Saturday evening to “reaffirm America’s ironclad commitment to the security of Israel.”


Biden told Netanyahu, according to media reports, that since the Iranian attack caused only minimal casualties and damage, Israel should not retaliate against Iran.


Both Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have been calling leaders in the region to make it clear that while Washington does not seek a direct military confrontation with Tehran, the United States will not hesitate to continue to defend Israel.


Biden had rushed back to Washington from a visit to Delaware earlier Saturday and convened a meeting in the White House Situation Room with key officials of his Cabinet as Iran launched the unprecedented attack after vowing to retaliate over an April 1 suspected Israeli airstrike on Iran’s consulate in Damascus.


Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the strike.


The U.S. military began moving extra troops and equipment to sites in the Middle East, defense officials confirmed Friday. It has about 40,000 troops in the region.


The U.S. Navy moved two guided-missile destroyers capable of intercepting drones and incoming missiles closer to Israel in anticipation of the Iranian attack, The Wall Street Journal reported.


U.S. Navy Red Sea forces have previously intercepted long-range missiles launched toward Israel from Yemen by the Iranian-allied Houthi forces.


The Biden administration's response to the Iranian attack will be closely watched by his political opponents, coming less than seven months before a general election rematch between the Democratic Party incumbent and his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump.


Trump, speaking Saturday at a rally in Schnecksville, Pennsylvania, claimed the attack “would not have happened if we were in office." He did not elaborate on how.


“God bless the people of Israel,” he said. “They are under attack right now. That's because we show great weakness.”


House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has failed to permit a floor vote on bipartisan legislation passed by the Senate providing security aid to Israel and Ukraine, is accusing Biden’s administration of undermining Israel and appeasing Iran and that “contributed to these terrible developments.”


A Republican congressman, Mike Turner of the state of Ohio, is calling for a more robust response from Biden.


“I think the administration needs to take seriously that this attack has happened. It's unprecedented and certainly it needs to be viewed as an escalation. This is an escalating conflict,” Turner, who chairs the intelligence committee in the House, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” program Sunday.


Democrat Chris Coons, of Biden’s home state of Delaware, is urging lawmakers to pass Biden’s request for military aid to Israel.


"The House should promptly pass this coming week the long-delayed national security supplemental to ensure that our Israeli allies have everything they need to defend themselves from attacks by Iran and its proxies,” he said.

## American Scottie Scheffler wins 2024 Masters golf tournament

date: 2024-04-14, from: VOA News USA

Augusta, Georgia — American Scottie Scheffler won his second Masters title with an ice-cool four stroke victory at Augusta National on Sunday.


Scheffler, the world number one and 2022 Masters winner, shot a final round four-under par 68 to end on 11-under for the tournament with Masters first-timer Ludvig Aberg of Sweden finishing as the runner-up.


It was a classic display of calmness and precision from Scheffler, who kept his focus after making bogies on the fourth and seventh holes to run away with the contest on the back nine.


Scheffler began the round with a one-shot lead over fellow American Collin Morikawa but the contest took a decisive turn on the ninth hole.


Morikawa double-bogeyed and Scheffler made birdie and the three-stroke swing left the 24-year-old Aberg his closest challenger after the turn.


But after Aberg double-bogeyed the 11th, the outcome was in Scheffler’s safe hands and the 27-year-old Texan made sure of victory with birdies on 13, 14 and 16.


The win is Scheffler's third victory of the season coming after his wins at Bay Hill and the Players Championship last month.

## AI-generated fashion models could bring more diversity to industry — or leave it with less

date: 2024-04-14, from: VOA News USA

Chicago, Illinois — London-based model Alexsandrah has a twin, but not in the way you'd expect: Her counterpart is made of pixels instead of flesh and blood.


The virtual twin was generated by artificial intelligence and has already appeared as a stand-in for the real-life Alexsandrah in a photo shoot. Alexsandrah, who goes by her first name professionally, in turn receives credit and compensation whenever the AI version of herself gets used — just like a human model.


Alexsandrah says she and her alter-ego mirror each other "even down to the baby hairs." And it is yet another example of how AI is transforming creative industries — and the way humans may or may not be compensated.


Proponents say the growing use of AI in fashion modeling showcases diversity in all shapes and sizes, allowing consumers to make more tailored purchase decisions that in turn reduces fashion waste from product returns. And digital modeling saves money for companies and creates opportunities for people who want to work with the technology.


But critics raise concerns that digital models may push human models — and other professionals like makeup artists and photographers — out of a job. Unsuspecting consumers could also be fooled into thinking AI models are real, and companies could claim credit for fulfilling diversity commitments without employing actual humans.


"Fashion is exclusive, with limited opportunities for people of color to break in," said Sara Ziff, a former fashion model and founder of the Model Alliance, a nonprofit aiming to advance workers' rights in the fashion industry. "I think the use of AI to distort racial representation and marginalize actual models of color reveals this troubling gap between the industry's declared intentions and their real actions."  


Women of color in particular have long faced higher barriers to entry in modeling and AI could upend some of the gains they've made. Data suggests that women are more likely to work in occupations in which the technology could be applied and are more at risk of displacement than men.


In March 2023, iconic denim brand Levi Strauss & Co. announced that it would be testing AI-generated models produced by Amsterdam-based company Lalaland.ai to add a wider range of body types and underrepresented demographics on its website. But after receiving widespread backlash, Levi clarified that it was not pulling back on its plans for live photo shoots, the use of live models or its commitment to working with diverse models.


"We do not see this (AI) pilot as a means to advance diversity or as a substitute for the real action that must be taken to deliver on our diversity, equity and inclusion goals and it should not have been portrayed as such," Levi said in its statement at the time.


The company last month said that it has no plans to scale the AI program.


The Associated Press reached out to several other retailers to ask whether they use AI fashion models. Target, Kohl's and fast-fashion giant Shein declined to comment; Temu did not respond to a request for comment.


Meanwhile, spokespeople for Nieman Marcus, H&M, Walmart and Macy's said their respective companies do not use AI models, although Walmart clarified that "suppliers may have a different approach to photography they provide for their products, but we don't have that information."


Nonetheless, companies that generate AI models are finding a demand for the technology, including Lalaland.ai, which was co-founded by Michael Musandu after he was feeling frustrated by the absence of clothing models who looked like him.


"One model does not represent everyone that's actually shopping and buying a product," he said. "As a person of color, I felt this painfully myself."


Musandu says his product is meant to supplement traditional photo shoots, not replace them. Instead of seeing one model, shoppers could see nine to 12 models using different size filters, which would enrich their shopping experience and help reduce product returns and fashion waste.


The technology is actually creating new jobs, since Lalaland.ai pays humans to train its algorithms, Musandu said.


And if brands "are serious about inclusion efforts, they will continue to hire these models of color," he added.


London-based model Alexsandrah, who is Black, says her digital counterpart has helped her distinguish herself in the fashion industry. In fact, the real-life Alexsandrah has even stood in for a Black computer-generated model named Shudu, created by Cameron Wilson, a former fashion photographer turned CEO of The Diigitals, a U.K.-based digital modeling agency.


Wilson, who is white and uses they/them pronouns, designed Shudu in 2017, described on Instagram as the "The World's First Digital Supermodel." But critics at the time accused Wilson of cultural appropriation and digital Blackface.


Wilson took the experience as a lesson and transformed The Diigitals to make sure Shudu — who has been booked by Louis Vuitton and BMW — didn't take away opportunities but instead opened possibilities for women of color. Alexsandrah, for instance, has modeled in-person as Shudu for Vogue Australia, and writer Ama Badu came up with Shudu's backstory and portrays her voice for interviews.


Alexsandrah said she is "extremely proud" of her work with The Diigitals, which created her own AI twin: "It's something that even when we are no longer here, the future generations can look back at and be like, 'These are the pioneers.'"


But for Yve Edmond, a New York City area-based model who works with major retailers to check the fit of clothing before it's sold to consumers, the rise of AI in fashion modeling feels more insidious.


Edmond worries modeling agencies and companies are taking advantage of models, who are generally independent contractors afforded few labor protections in the U.S., by using their photos to train AI systems without their consent or compensation.


She described one incident in which a client asked to photograph Edmond moving her arms, squatting and walking for "research" purposes. Edmond refused and later felt swindled — her modeling agency had told her she was being booked for a fitting, not to build an avatar.


"This is a complete violation," she said. "It was really disappointing for me."


But absent AI regulations, it's up to companies to be transparent and ethical about deploying AI technology. And Ziff, the founder of the Model Alliance, likens the current lack of legal protections for fashion workers to "the Wild West."


That's why the Model Alliance is pushing for legislation like the one being considered in New York state, in which a provision of the Fashion Workers Act would require management companies and brands to obtain models' clear written consent to create or use a model's digital replica; specify the amount and duration of compensation, and prohibit altering or manipulating models' digital replica without consent.


Alexsandrah says that with ethical use and the right legal regulations, AI might open up doors for more models of color like herself. She has let her clients know that she has an AI replica, and she funnels any inquires for its use through Wilson, who she describes as "somebody that I know, love, trust and is my friend." Wilson says they make sure any compensation for Alexsandrah's AI is comparable to what she would make in-person.


Edmond, however, is more of a purist: "We have this amazing Earth that we're living on. And you have a person of every shade, every height, every size. Why not find that person and compensate that person?"

## US judge tosses out lawsuits against Libyan commander accused of war crimes

date: 2024-04-14, from: VOA News USA

Alexandria, Virginia — A U.S. judge has tossed out a series of civil lawsuits against a Libyan military commander who used to live in Virginia and was accused of killing innocent civilians in that country's civil war.


At a court hearing Friday, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema said she had no jurisdiction to preside over a case alleging war crimes committed in Libya, even though the defendant, Khalifa Haftar, has U.S. citizenship and lived for more than 20 years in the northern Virginia suburbs of the nation's capital as an exile from the regime of Moammar Gadhafi.


The ruling was a significant reversal of fortune for Haftar. In 2022, Brinkema entered a default judgment against Haftar after he refused to sit for scheduled depositions about his role in the fighting that has plagued the country over the last decade.


But Haftar retained new lawyers who persuaded the judge to reopen the case and made Haftar available to be deposed. He sat for two separate depositions in 2022 and 2023 and denied orchestrating attacks against civilians.


Once a lieutenant to Gadhafi, Haftar defected to the U.S. during the 1980s. He is widely believed to have worked with the CIA during his time in exile.


He returned to Libya in 2011 to support anti-Gadhafi forces that revolted against the dictator and killed him. During the country's civil war, he led the self-styled Libyan National Army, which controlled much of the eastern half of Libya, with support from countries including Russia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. He continues to hold sway in the eastern half of the country.


In the lawsuits, first filed in 2019, the plaintiffs say family members were killed by military bombardments conducted by Haftar's army in civilian areas.


The lawsuits also alleged that Haftar and his family owned a significant amount of property in Virginia, which could have been used to pay off any judgment that would have been entered against him.


While the lawsuits were tossed out on technical issues over jurisdiction, one of Haftar's lawyers, Paul Kamenar, said Haftar denied any role in the deaths of civilians.


"He's not this ruthless figure that everyone wants to portray him as," Kamenar said in a phone interview Sunday.


Faisal Gill, a lawyer for plaintiffs in one of the three lawsuits that Brinkema tossed out Friday, said he plans to appeal the dismissal.


Mark Zaid, lawyer for another set of plaintiffs, called Brinkema's ruling perplexing and said he believes that the court's jurisdiction to hear the case had already been established at an earlier phase of the case.


"A U.S. citizen committed war crimes abroad and thus far has escaped civil accountability," Zaid said Sunday in an emailed statement.


In court papers, Haftar tried to claim immunity from the suits as a head of state. At one point, the judge put the cases on pause because she worried that the lawsuits were being used to influence scheduled presidential elections in Libya, in which Haftar was a candidate. Those elections were later postponed.

## News organizations urge Biden, Trump to commit to presidential debates

date: 2024-04-14, from: VOA News USA

New York — Twelve news organizations on Sunday urged presumptive presidential nominees Joe Biden and Donald Trump to agree to debates, saying they were a "rich tradition" that have been part of every general election campaign since 1976.


While Trump, who did not participate in debates for the Republican nomination, has indicated a willingness to take on his 2020 rival, the Democratic president has not committed to debating him again.


Although invitations have not been formally issued, the news organizations said it was not too early for each campaign to say publicly that it will participate in the three presidential and one vice presidential forums set by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates.


"If there is one thing Americans can agree on during this polarized time, it is that the stakes of this election are exceptionally high," the organizations said in a joint statement. "Amidst that backdrop, there is simply no substitute for the candidates debating with each other, and before the American people, their visions for the future of our nation."


ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox, PBS, NBC, NPR and The Associated Press all signed on to the letter.


Biden and Trump debated twice in 2020. A third debate was canceled after Trump, then president, tested positive for COVID-19 and would not debate remotely.


Asked on March 8 whether he would commit to a debate with Trump, Biden said, "it depends on his behavior." The president was visibly miffed by his opponent in the freewheeling first 2020 debate, at one point saying, "will you shut up?"


Trump campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said in a letter this past week that "we have already indicated President Trump is willing to debate anytime, any place and anywhere — and the time to start these debates is now."


They cited the seven 1858 Illinois Senate debates between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas, saying "certainly today's America deserves as much."


The Republican National Committee voted in 2022 to no longer participate in forums sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The Trump campaign has not indicated it would adhere to that but did have some conditions. The campaign managers said the commission selected a "demonstrably anti-Trump moderator" in then-Fox News host Chris Wallace in 2020 and wants assurances the commission debates are fair and impartial.


The Trump campaign also wants the timetable moved up, saying that many Americans will have already voted by Sept. 16, Oct. 1 and Oct. 9, the dates of the three debates set by the commission.


The Biden campaign declined comment on the news organizations' letter, pointing to the president's earlier statement. There was no immediate response from the Trump campaign.


But on Saturday, Trump held a rally in northeast Pennsylvania with two lecterns set up on the stage: one for him to give a speech, the other to symbolize what he said was Biden's refusal to debate him. The second lectern had a placard that read, "Anytime. Anywhere. Anyplace."


Midway through his campaign speech, Trump turned to his right and pointed to the second lectern.


"We have a little, look at this, it's for him," he said. "See the podium? I'm calling on Crooked Joe Biden to debate anytime, anywhere, any place. Right there. And we have to debate because our country is going in the wrong direction so badly and while it's a little bit typically early we have to debate. We have to explain to the American people what the hell is going on," Trump said.


C-SPAN, NewsNation and Univision also joined the letter calling for debates. Only one newspaper, USA Today, added its voice. The Washington Post declined a request to join.


Certainly the broadcasters could use the juice that debates may bring. Television news ratings are down significantly compared with the 2020 campaign, although there are other factors involved, such as cord-cutting and the pandemic, that increased interest in news four years ago.


There were no Democratic debates this presidential cycle, and Trump's refusal to participate in the Republican forums depressed interest in them.

## Linux 6.10 to merge NTSYNC driver for emulating Windows NT synchronization primitives

## Oregon city asks US Supreme Court: Can homeless people be fined for sleeping outside?

date: 2024-04-14, from: VOA News USA

GRANTS PASS, Oregon — A pickleball game in this leafy Oregon community was suddenly interrupted one rainy weekend morning by the arrival of an ambulance. Paramedics rushed through the park toward a tent, one of dozens illegally erected by the town's hundreds of homeless people, then play resumed as though nothing had happened.


Mere feet away, volunteers helped dismantle tents to move an 80-year-old man and a woman blind in one eye, who risked being fined for staying too long. In the distance, a group of boys climbed on a jungle gym.


The scenes were emblematic of the crisis gripping the small, Oregon mountain town of Grants Pass, where a fierce fight over park space has become a battleground for a much larger, national debate on homelessness that has reached the U.S. Supreme Court.


The town's case, set to be heard April 22, has broad implications for how not only Grants Pass, but communities nationwide address homelessness, including whether they can fine or jail people for camping in public. It has made the town of 40,000 the unlikely face of the nation’s homelessness crisis, and further fueled the debate over how to deal with it.


“I certainly wish this wasn’t what my town was known for,” Mayor Sara Bristol told The Associated Press last month. "It’s not the reason why I became mayor. And yet it has dominated every single thing that I’ve done for the last 3 1/2 years.”


Officials across the political spectrum — from Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in California, which has nearly 30% of the nation’s homeless population, to a group of 22 conservative-led states — have filed briefs in the case, saying lower court rulings have hamstrung their ability to deal with encampments.


Like many Western communities, Grants Pass has struggled for years with a burgeoning homeless population. A decade ago, City Council members discussed how to make it “uncomfortable enough ... in our city so they will want to move on down the road.” From 2013 to 2018, the city said it issued 500 citations for camping or sleeping in public, including in vehicles, with fines that could reach hundreds of dollars.


But a 2018 decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals changed the calculus. The court, whose jurisdiction includes nine Western states, held that while communities are allowed to prohibit tents in public spaces, it violated the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment to give people criminal citations for sleeping outside when they had no place else to go.


Four years later, in a case challenging restrictions in Grants Pass, the court expanded that ruling, holding that civil citations also can be unconstitutional.




Civil rights groups and attorneys for the homeless residents who challenged the restrictions in 2018 insist people shouldn't be punished for lacking housing. Officials throughout the West have overstated the impact of the court decisions to distract from their own failings, they argued.


“For years, political leaders have chosen to tolerate encampments as an alternative to meaningfully addressing the western region’s severe housing shortage,” the attorneys wrote. “It is easier to blame the courts than to take responsibility for finding a solution.”


In Grants Pass, the town’s parks, many lining the picturesque Rogue River, are at the heart of the debate. Cherished for their open spaces, picnic tables, playgrounds and sports fields, they host everything from annual boat-racing festivals and vintage car shows to Easter egg hunts and summer concerts.


They’re also the sites of encampments blighted by illegal drug use and crime, including a shooting at a park last year that left one person dead. Tents cluster along riverbanks, next to tennis courts and jungle gyms, with tarps shielding belongings from the rain. When the sun comes out, clothes and blankets are strung across tree branches to dry. Used needles litter the ground.


Grants Pass has just one overnight shelter for adults, the Gospel Rescue Mission. It has 138 beds, but rules including attendance at daily Christian services, no alcohol, drugs or smoking and no pets mean many won't stay there.


Cassy Leach, a nurse, leads a volunteer group providing food, medical care and other basic goods to the town's hundreds of homeless people. They help relocate their tents to comply with city rules.


At one park last month, she checked on a man who burned his leg after falling on a torch lighter during a fentanyl overdose and brought him naloxone, the opioid overdose reversal medication. In another, she distributed cans of beans, peas and Chef Boyardee mini ravioli from a pickup truck.


“Love, hope, community and a safety net is really as important as a shower and water,” Leach said.


Dre Buetow, 48, from northern California, has been living in his car for three years after a bone cancer diagnosis and $450,000 in medical bills. The illness and treatment kept him from returning to his old tree-trimming job, he said.


Laura Gutowski’s husband died from a pulmonary embolism and she suddenly found herself, in her 50s, with no income. They didn’t have life insurance or savings and, within a month, she was sleeping outside in the city she grew up in.


“I used to love camping,” she said through tears. “And now I can’t stand it anymore.”


Volunteers like Leach came to her rescue. “They’re angels,” she said.


But some residents want to limit aid because of the trash left behind after encampment moves or food handouts. The City Council proposed requiring outreach groups to register with the city. The mayor vetoed it, laying bare the discord gripping Grants Pass.


Before the council attempted, unsuccessfully, to override the veto last month, a self-proclaimed “park watch” group rallied outside City Hall with signs reading, “Parks are for kids.” Drivers in passing cars honked their support.


The group regularly posts images of trash, tents and homeless people on social media. On Sundays, they set up camp chairs in what they say is a bid to reclaim park space.


Brock Spurgeon says he used to take his grandkids to parks that were so full it was hard to find an available picnic table. Now, open drug use and discarded needles have scared families away, he said.


“That was taken away from us when the campers started using the parks,” he said.


Still, Spurgeon said his own brother died while homeless in a nearby city, and his son is living in the parks as he struggles with addiction. Once, he said, he realized with shock that the homeless person covered with blankets that he stepped past to enter a grocery store was his son.


“I miss my son every night, and I hold my breath that he won’t OD in the park,” Spurgeon said.


Mayor Bristol and advocates have sought to open a shelter with fewer rules, or a designated area for homeless people to camp. But charged debates emerged over where that would be and who would pay for it.


While support for a designated campground appears to be growing, the problem remains: Many homeless people in Grants Pass have nowhere else to live. And some advocates fear a return of strict anti-camping enforcement will push people to the forest outside town, farther from help.


Even if the Supreme Court overturns the 9th Circuit's decisions, Bristol said, "we still have 200 people who have to go somewhere.”


"We have to accept that homelessness is a reality in America,” she said.

## Barges break loose on Ohio River in Pittsburgh, damaging marina, striking bridge

date: 2024-04-14, from: VOA News USA

PITTSBURGH, USA — More than two dozen river barges broke loose from their moorings and floated down the Ohio River in Pittsburgh, striking one bridge that had already been preemptively closed and damaging a marina, officials said. The boats eventually were pinned to the riverbank or went over a dam downstream, officials said.


Pittsburgh police, fire and emergency medical services responded around 11:25 p.m. Friday to reports of the barges “floating uncontrolled” down the river, Pittsburgh Public Safety said in a statement. The area had been hit by flooding after heavy rains Thursday.


The Sewickley Bridge was struck by a barge a few minutes before 2 p.m. Saturday, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation said. It “was closed in advance of the strike and will remain closed until our crews complete an inspection," spokesperson Steve Cowan said.


Officials in Moon Township, which is connected by the bridge to the community of Sewickley, earlier said the span would be temporarily closed “due to unmanned barge passing through.”


Eleven of the 26 barges that broke free were quickly contained to one side by another towing vessel just downstream, said Cmdr. Justin Jolley of the Coast Guard marine safety unit in Pittsburgh. Nine others were collected at the Emsworth lock and dam downstream.


Five or six barges went through the dam. Four ended up just downstream at a lock and dam, while another ended up on the bank of the river and was stabilized. Marine safety units were searching for one barge unaccounted for, Jolley said.


Pittsburgh public safety officials reported damage to Peggy’s Harbor, a marina on the river. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that the McKees Rocks Bridge was also closed as a precaution but later reopened following inspection.


Twenty-three of the barges were carrying dry cargo, mostly coal, and at least one was loaded with fertilizer, according to the owner, Jolley said. Three were empty. There were no hazardous materials on any of the vessels, the city said.


The Coast Guard put out a broadcast notice to mariners to inform them about the potential hazard, but high water was preventing traffic on the river, Jolley said.


The barges were owned or operated by Campbell Transportation Co., the city's statement said. Jolley said Coast Guard officials were working with the owner on a salvage plan. Pennsylvania State Police and other agencies were also alerted.


The vulnerability of bridges to strikes from barges and ships came into stark relief last month when a container ship rammed a support of the major Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, collapsing the span and leading to the deaths or presumptive deaths of six road workers.

## April 13, 2024

date: 2024-04-14, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

There are really two major Republican political stories dominating the news these days. The more obvious of the two is the attempt by former president Donald Trump and his followers to destroy American democracy. The other story is older, the one that led to Trump but that stands at least a bit apart from him. It is the story of a national shift away from the supply-side ideology of Reagan Republicans toward an embrace of the idea that the government should hold the playing field among all Americans level.
