<h2 id="south-africa-to-take-israel-to-top-un-court-on-genocide-claim-in-gaza">South Africa to Take Israel to Top UN Court on Genocide Claim in Gaza</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>white house — South Africa is taking the war in Gaza to a top global court, accusing Israel of genocide in a lengthy court filing that the International Court of Justice is preparing to hear next week.  </p>
<p>Israel says the filing constitutes “blood libel,” and the White House dimisses it as “meritless.”  </p>
<p>More than 22,000 Palestinians have perished since the start of Israel’s offensive on Gaza, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health. U.S. officials have previously cast doubt on those figures, noting that the ministry is run by Hamas, the group that was elected to govern Gaza and whose armed wing launched the October 7 attack on Israel that killed more than 1,200 people. </p>
<p>Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and some of its allies, lists the killing of Jews and the elimination of the Jewish state as its main objectives. </p>
<p>South Africa’s 84-page submission, filed last week, says that Israel’s actions in its Gaza offensive “are genocidal in character, as they are committed with the requisite specific intent … to destroy Palestinians in Gaza as a part of the broader Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group.”</p>
<p>Israel’s use of state organs and agents to do this, they say, is a violation of its obligations under the 1948 Genocide Convention.  </p>
<p>Alarms over possible war crimes</p>
<p>International organizations, including United Nations agencies, have raised alarms over possible war crimes, with the U.N.’s human rights agency calling in November for “prompt, transparent and independent investigations into allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity, perpetrated in Israel and in the Occupied Palestinian Territory on 7 October 2023 and thereafter.”  </p>
<p>Israel’s government has slammed the move as a “decision to play advocate for the devil” and accused South Africa of “blood libel.” The accusation that Jewish people use the blood of Christians in religious rituals has been touted for centuries — notably by the genocidal Nazi regime, which oversaw the extermination of some 6 million Jews — to justify targeting Jews.  </p>
<p>“History will judge South Africa for its criminal complicity with the bloodiest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, and it will judge it without mercy,” said Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy. </p>
<p>The White House, when asked by VOA, dismissed South Africa’s argument.  </p>
<p>“We find this submission meritless, counterproductive and completely without any basis in fact whatsoever,” said John Kirby, director of strategic communications for the National Security Council.  </p>
<p>South Africa’s Foreign Affairs Ministry did not respond to requests for comment, but spokesperson Clayson Monyela said on the social media platform X that this is an example of his nation’s decision to “flex its diplomatic muscle in defense of humanity.”  </p>
<p>South Africa’s ruling African National Congress has historically supported the Palestinian cause, with the nation’s first democratically elected president, Nelson Mandela, saying, “We know too well that our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians.”  </p>
<p>In the court application, South Africa argues that the treatment of Palestinians also bears strong resemblance to South Africa’s own racially motivated apartheid regime, which ended in 1994 with Mandela’s election.  </p>
<p>“It is important,” the submission reads, “to place the acts of genocide in the broader context of Israel’s conduct towards Palestinians during its 75-year-long apartheid, its 56-year-long belligerent occupation of Palestinian territory and its 16-year-long blockade of Gaza, including the serious and ongoing violations of international law associated therewith, including grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention, and other war crimes and crimes against humanity.” </p>
<p>The grassroots Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) says it supports South Africa’s submission, which has also been endorsed by Muslim-majority nations Turkey and Malaysia.  </p>
<p>Robert McCaw, government affairs department director for CAIR, notes that while the group has “condemned the killing of Palestinians and Israelis alike” and the actions of both Hamas and Israel’s government, it believes South Africa’s case “fits the definition of genocide.” </p>
<p>“When you are systematically erasing Palestinians from Gaza, that is a genocide,” he said. “And you can, you know, use whatever terms you want to dismiss this claim, but it’s a genocide.” </p>
<p>But can it stop the war? South Africa, in its submission, asks the court to immediately call upon Israel to halt attacks, but it’s not clear whether such a ruling would stick.  </p>
<p>“It can’t enforce its verdicts, but members of the United Nations, which are all the world’s government, they can accept its findings, and that impacts the types of policies that are put out by the U.N.,” McCaw said. </p>
<p>“So, this can have a significant impact in how we might be able to get a cease-fire or to hold Israel accountable by other means for its ongoing genocide of Palestinians. Also, it’s a very good way to legally document the crimes that are occurring.” </p>
<p>Proceedings begin January 11 and will be streamed live on the United Nations’ web-based TV site.</p>

<h2 id="what-should-we-know-about-apfs-special-files">What should we know about APFS special files?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>We may have been using APFS for nearly seven years, but some of its features remain thoroughly opaque. On Christmas Day, I posed the puzzle of 60 TB of snapshots being removed from a 2 TB disk. While we all accept that may be “technically correct”, for ordinary users it makes no sense. Suggestions that they should be “educated” miss the point that the Finder has to be accessible to all users, whether or not they have a degree in Computer Science. If my eleven year-old granddaughter can’t make sense of it, then the Finder is a failure. Today I turn to another thorny issue raised by the ingenuity of APFS: the size of its special file types, sparse and ‘clone’ files. As usual, I start with a practical demonstration. ↫ Howard Oakley I feel like I should ring a little bell while posting a link to this article.</p>

<h2 id="renewables-enter-an-older-and-wiser-phase">Renewables Enter an Older and Wiser Phase</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDk5NTM3Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MjI0NzgxNX0.d1ev8WU-rnkmCzRIcJJEjxAcinAUDzm9sReEhT_0yBA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Last year showed that renewables are not fated to always and everywhere get steadily cheaper. But if 2023 was a year when the industry was hampered by inflation, high interest rates, and lingering supply chain issues, then maybe 2024 could be a year of normalization — when governments, utilities, and energy companies have at least started to figure things out.
</p>
<p>
“There’s optimism going into 2024,” Allegra Dawes, an associate fellow at the Center for Center for Strategic and International Studies, told me.
</p>
<p>
The difficulties of 2023 were nowhere more obvious than in offshore wind, where <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/offshore-wind-power-cost-expensive" target="_self">rising costs</a> led to <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/everyones-mad-at-offshore-wind-developers" target="_self">cancellations of projects</a> as states and developers couldn’t agree on new contracts. This year already has seen the <a href="https://www.equinor.com/news/20240103-empire-wind-2-offshore-wind-project-announces-reset" target="_blank">scrubbing</a> of one New York offshore wind project, Empire Wind 2, although developers Equinor and BP will likely <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/equinor-bp-cancel-contract-sell-offshore-wind-power-new-york-2024-01-03/" target="_blank">rebid</a> under a new system that better accounts for the possibilities of costs rising.
</p>
<p>
At (nearly) the same time, though, power customers on New York’s Long Island were the first in the U.S. to receive utility-scale offshore wind power at the <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/orsted-south-fork-wind-first-offshore-power" target="_blank">end of last year,</a> while New Englanders enjoyed their first offshore wind power <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/orsted-south-fork-wind-first-offshore-power" target="_blank">just this week</a>. The turmoil of 2023 doesn’t mean that offshore wind — or any other part of the energy transition — is completely off track, just that it’s entering a different, more mature phase<strong>.</strong>
</p>
<p>
“What we’re all learning is that building out renewable sources will likely be more expensive,” Dawes said. Repeated and rapid cost declines in solar — far beyond experts’ annual projections — may have lulled investors and policymakers into thinking that <em>all</em> renewable energy sources would forever follow the same trajectory. If so, the awakening was a rude one. “Those cost declines we saw in solar are not going to be easily replicable in all technologies,” Dawes said.
</p>
<p>
High interest rates have particularly <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/high-interest-rates-clean-energy" target="_blank">bedeviled</a> renewable projects, as they typically need a large amount of upfront financing for years before they can start generating power. This, at least, is one place the industry can expect relief: Federal Reserve officials have predicted that the central bank will <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/02/economy/interest-rate-cuts-inflation-fed-2024/index.html#:~:text=Officials%20penciled%20in%20three%20rate,at%20Allianz%20Trade%2C%20told%20CNN." target="_blank">cut rates three times in 2024</a>, which could bring partial relief to renewable developers. Traders, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/03/fed-minutes-december-2023-.html" target="_blank">predict a much faster pace of easing</a>. And as laws like the infrastructure bill and Inflation Reduction Act are further implemented, meaning that funding for specific provisions begins to flow in earnest and newly written rules come into effect, investors and businesses will be able to make informed decisions as to how best to take advantage.<em> </em>
</p>
<p>
<em></em> “We have massive amounts of projects in the queue,” Dawes said. “Announcements of solar and wind continue.” Just in solar, the Energy Information Administration expects <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/" target="_blank">37 gigawatts</a> of new capacity, on top of the 23 gigawatts it expects when the figures for 2023 are tallied up. Solar and wind, the EIA projects, will, all-told, generate more power than coal for the first time ever.
</p>
<p>
All this renewable energy will need new transmission capacity to meaningfully affect the carbon intensity of electricity generation in the United States. The <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/permitting-reform-transmission-nepa-geothermal" target="_blank">difficulties</a> of building new transmission — especially long-distance transmission — and the never-ending queue of new projects waiting to be connected to the grid have long been considered a <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/battery-storage-solar-transmission-handmer" target="_blank">major hold-up</a> in the decarbonization process. While the nation’s grid and transmission problems won’t be solved in 2024, incremental progress will likely be made, with <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2023/11/30/as-states-advance-clean-energy-projects-2024-looms-as-pivotal-year" target="_blank">billions of dollars in federal funds</a> available for grid planning and investment. One massive transmission project to bring wind power from New Mexico and Arizona that’s been in the works for literally decades finally started construction late last year, indicating that these types of projects <a href="https://patternenergy.com/pattern-energy-closes-11-billion-financing-of-largest-clean-energy-infrastructure-project-in-u-s-history/" target="_blank"><em>can</em> get financed</a>.
</p>
<p>
And there are signs that, despite the rocky recent past, investors are beginning to believe in the long-term future of renewables. “The impact of unprecedented investment in renewable infrastructure will likely become more apparent in 2024,” Deloitte analysts <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/renewable-energy/renewable-energy-industry-outlook.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said in a report</a>. “Regulatory boosts to renewable energy and transmission buildout could help address grid constraints.”
</p>
<p>
There are still any number of bottlenecks beyond financing and costs. One is actually getting federal government programs to begin to build. As of early December, the $7.5 billion allotted for building out an electric vehicle charging network, for instance, had produced precisely zero chargers. But that, too, could begin to change this year, with <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/05/congress-ev-chargers-billions-00129996" target="_blank">Ohio breaking ground on chargers</a>.
</p>
<p>
If we were to say any one thing about the energy transition story in 2024, it’s that it won’t be all about huge new laws or policies, but instead about steadily chipping away at implementation. That’s not fun or sexy, but it is what grown-ups do.

<h2 id="white-house-hopes-for-free-safe-polls-in-taiwan">White House Hopes for Free, Safe Polls in Taiwan</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>white house — The Biden administration hopes that Taiwan’s voters can freely choose their next leader when the island votes next week in a general election, says John Kirby, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications, in an interview with VOA’s White House Correspondent Paris Huang on Thursday.</p>
<p>Kirby also reiterated that President Joe Biden and his administration are “all in” on cooperation with the African continent in the coming year.</p>
<p>The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.</p>
<p>VOA: Let’s start with Taiwan’s elections. According to the Taiwanese government, China has been interfering in the election, including spreading disinformation and misinformation. Taiwanese prosecutors are investigating allegations that China bribed Taiwanese officials with travel and money to influence the election. When they met in San Francisco, President Biden told President Xi Jinping not to interfere with the Taiwan election. Is President Xi is ignoring his advice?</p>
<p>John Kirby, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications: I can’t confirm these individual reports of interference with the electoral process in Taiwan. We’ve been very clear that we respect Taiwan’s democratic institutions. We respect the will of the people of Taiwan to make these sorts of decisions in terms of their own governance. And we don’t want any other actor, be it a nation state or otherwise, to interfere in this election.</p>
<p>VOA: Will the United States have confidence in Taiwan’s election results if there’s hard evidence that China did influence the election?</p>
<p>Kirby: Look, that’s a hypothetical. I’m just not willing to speculate at this point. We want these elections to be free and fair and transparent. We want the will of the people of Taiwan to be respected. We’ll just monitor this as closely as we can.</p>
<p>VOA: This year, China has sent at least nine fighter jets, four navy ships and at least six balloons over Taiwan. What is the White House’s message to China regarding rising tension in the region before the Taiwan election?</p>
<p>Kirby: Again, it’s important that as the people of Taiwan go to the polls to cast their ballots, that they can do so with a feeling of safety and security and comfort in the knowledge that their vote matters, and that it’s going to be appropriately tallied. And that’s really what we’re focused on. That’s what we want to see happen.</p>
<p>VOA: Moving on to the South China Sea. The United States and the Philippines recently had a joint exercise in the South China Sea. Now China is holding a rival exercise in the same region. And recently, China finally appointed a new defense minister, Navy Admiral Dong Jun. Is the White House watching this? Does this mean that China could be more aggressive in the South China Sea region in the future? And has Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin reached out to the admiral?</p>
<p>Kirby: You’d have to talk to Secretary Austin. I don’t know whether he’s reached out to the new nominee for defense secretary. I think we should be careful before drawing conclusions over somebody’s nomination to a job and how they’re going to execute that job based on the jobs that they’ve had in the past. We’ll have to judge this individual as we would judge any leader around the world by their actions, not merely by their resume.</p>
<p>We don’t seek a conflict with the [People’s Republic of China]. We don’t want to see conflict in the South China Sea. We do want to make sure that our national interests and the national interests of our allies and partners are respected in the South China Sea and elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific, which is why we have a robust military capability there. It’s why the president felt it was so important to get military-to-military communications back up and running between the United States and the PRC, and they have, and that’s a good thing.</p>
<p>I’m sure Secretary Austin, at the appropriate time, will speak to the new defense minister. And it’s our hope that that relationship, while we don’t expect to agree on everything, can at least provide yet another layer of insulation in terms of preventing miscalculation and misunderstanding between our two countries. The PRC has made some unfounded maritime claims when it comes to the South China Sea. We expect that we’re going to maintain the capability for our allies and partners there to be able to manage their own national security and to protect the free flow of international commerce there.</p>
<p>VOA: Moving on to Africa. What is next for U.S.-Africa engagement? Could we see more military cooperation or some high-level trips this year?</p>
<p>Kirby: I think you’re going to see us continue to be all-in when it comes to Africa. We have already made terrific progress on many of the commitments that we made in the Africa Leaders Summit, and there have been visits by some 17 senior-level officials of the United States government. I fully expect that those high-level engagements will continue.</p>
<p>VOA: The U.S. has imposed sanctions on individuals in several African countries that are experiencing conflict, like the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan. President Biden also recently revoked [African Growth and Opportunity Act] access over human rights issues in the Central African Republic, Gabon, Niger and Uganda. Is this type of economic statecraft the main lever that the United States has for managing its relationship with the continent? And is this enough to counter China’s rising influence and massive expenditures on the continent?</p>
<p>Kirby: Well, first of all, these actions we’re taking, these economic actions you’re talking about, were designed to express our deep concern and to do it tangibly about some of the practices by leaders in these countries. It has nothing to do with trying to counter China. It’s about leading our foreign policy with a strong focus on human and civil rights and doing what’s right and making it clear what we will and what we won’t stand for.</p>
<p>We have other tools at our disposal, which, again, I’m not in a position to speculate about right at this time, but it’s not about China. These countries all get to decide for themselves what kind of relationship they want with the United States and what kind of relationship they want with China. That’s up to them. We’re comfortable that we’ve got a strong network of relationships across the continent. We’re comfortable that we’re taking real action to give African nations and African leaders alternatives in terms of financing, transparent, healthy, vibrant financing opportunities that won’t push their countries further into debt the way that other financial relationships with other countries outside the continent have caused to our African friends.</p>
<p>We’re going to keep doing what we’ve been doing, meeting the commitments that we made during the Africa Leaders Summit, offering opportunities for infrastructure growth and development and investment that are sound and viable and transparent, and continuing to honestly put our money where our mouth is when it comes to standing up for shared principles and values.</p>

<p>
Although Canada has developed a reputation as a responsible steward of its massive — and environmentally crucial — boreal forests, a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/13/1/6" target="_blank">new study</a> published in the journal <em>Land</em> calls that reputation into question. The analysis, by researchers at Australia’s Griffith University, found that 35.4 million acres of the country’s evergreen forests in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec have been effectively lost to logging since 1976. The government-approved methods used to regenerate those forests — which require loggers to replant cleared areas or show that the region will recover on its own — have had a devastating result, as similar practices <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/14/climate/tree-planting-reforestation-climate.html" target="_blank">have had</a> in many other parts of the world.

</p>
<p>
While 56 million acres of older trees remain across the two provinces, that acreage is now interspersed with patchworks of newly planted trees chosen for their future suitability for logging, not for purposes of ecological diversity or wildfire prevention. “The Canadian government claims to have managed the forest according to the principles of sustainable forest management,” Brendan Mackey, the study’s lead author, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/04/world/canada/canada-boreal-forest-logging.html" target="_blank">told</a> <em>The New York Times</em>. “But its notion of sustainability is really tied to maintaining and maximizing wood production and ensuring the regeneration of commercially desirable trees. That has a lot of implications for biodiversity.”
</p>
<p>
Canada’s forest managers <a href="https://natural-resources.canada.ca/our-natural-resources/forests/wildland-fires-insects-disturbances/deforestation-canada-key-myths-and-facts/13419" target="_blank">say</a> that “At 0.02% of its forested area, [the rate of] deforestation in Canada is among the world’s lowest,” which sounds impressive until <a href="https://natural-resources.canada.ca/our-natural-resources/forests/sustainable-forest-management/boreal-forest/13071" target="_blank">this caveat</a>: “an area with very young trees is still a forest. The term ‘deforestation’ refers to land that has been cleared of trees and permanently converted to another use.” It’s a bit like claiming that a zombie is a healthy, normal person, simply because it seems to be alive. So while Canada may not have widespread deforestation, what it does have are swaths of newer trees that are far less effective than their forebears when it comes to carbon capture, species diversity, and wildfire prevention. “Forest degradation is the more important metric for Canada because it really captures more of what’s actually happening,” Peter Wood, of the University of British Columbia, told the <em>Times</em>. “Canada has downplayed the impact of the forest industry.”

<h2 id="why-republicans-are-going-after-sunnova-and-jigar-shah">Why Republicans Are Going After Sunnova (And Jigar Shah)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTAwNDI1Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0ODg0NzE1Mn0.dfsLRjfAtewY6tnLvObwVkeJfbpJ4r-mNUQufXBrxmQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
If Republicans have their way, Sunnova and Solyndra are about to have more in common than just being solar companies with Pokémon-sounding names.
</p>
<p>
More than 12 years after conservatives targeted Solyndra — a scandal-plagued, now-defunct solar company that received a $535 million loan from the Energy Department’s Loan Programs Office under President Barack Obama — Republicans are attempting to run the same playbook on the rooftop solar company Sunnova, <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/bidens-400-billion-green-bank-at-risk-as-gop-hunt-new-solyndra" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Bloomberg</em> reported Thursday</a>. They’ve literally said as much: “Solyndra is going to look like chump change compared to the amount of money that’s been wasted by this administration,” Wyoming Republican John Barrasso, who is leading the charge with his Senate colleague Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, bragged <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/how-a-doe-loan-guarantee-put-sunnova-in-republican-crosshairs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in comments to reporters last month</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Solyndra fiasco of 2011 effectively shut down the Energy Department’s loan program, which aims to finance the U.S. energy transition by backing emerging technology companies that otherwise might be considered too risky for traditional lenders. At the time, Republicans had zeroed in on Obama’s Energy Department over its approval of a loan to Solyndra, which went insolvent shortly afterward and was later discovered to have <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ig/articles/special-report-11-0078-i" target="_blank">misled the department</a> during its application process. The whole ordeal effectively gave the Loan Programs Office “Solyndra PTSD,” Jigar Shah, the current director of the office, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/green-energy-climate-loans-49fda73b" target="_blank">told <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> last year. It wasn’t until Biden revived the LPO as <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/inflation-reduction-act-grants-funding" target="_self">one of the three pots of money</a> fueling his climate agenda that it really started loaning in earnest again. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, its loan authority grew to over <a href="https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2023/02/doe-loan-programs-office-2023-updates-overview-and-key-insights" target="_blank">$400 billion</a>.
</p>
<p>
And despite the high-profile failed project and goal of helping high-risk businesses, the LPO has been mostly a major success: around the same time it was backing Solyndra, the office also gave a $465 million loan to Tesla, which in turn paid back the loan with interest <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2013/05/tesla-the-anti-solyndra-repays-doe-loans-9-years-early.html" target="_blank">a full nine years early</a>. The LPO has actually made the government almost $5 billion in interest payments, <em>Bloomberg</em> adds, while LPO-supported projects were responsible for producing enough clean energy to power 900,000 homes and enough fuel-efficient vehicles to displace 2.1 million gallons of gasoline in 2022, the Department of Energy <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/DOE-LPO_Event_APSR-FY2022-Release_v03_2023-04-22.pdf" target="_blank">reports</a>.
</p>
<p>
All this brings us to Sunnova Energy. A rooftop solar company based out of Houston, Sunnova was approved for a $3 billion loan guarantee by the LPO <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/energy-department-commits-3-billion-to-expand-rooftop-solar-access-b02f2c11?mod=article_inline" target="_blank">last April</a>. Since then, the company has become a target of conservatives and right-wing media personalities, who seem intent on finding a Solyndra-shaped scandal “that would aid their efforts to repeal President Joe Biden’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act and its historic $369 billion in climate and energy provisions,” <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/right-wing-media-are-targeting-federal-loan-guarantee-embattled-solar-company-proxy-war" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Media Matters</em> writes</a>. <em>The Washington Free Beacon</em>, citing customer complaints, has alleged Sunnova <a href="https://freebeacon.com/energy/biden-admin-gave-3-billion-loan-to-solar-company-accused-of-scamming-elderly/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">scammed elderly dementia patients</a>, while Fox News’ Jesse Watters has repeatedly gone after the company for supposedly handing away “$3 billion — billion — of your money.” (Sunnova only has a loan guarantee; money has not been distributed yet, <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/how-a-doe-loan-guarantee-put-sunnova-in-republican-crosshairs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>E&amp;E News</em> reports</a>).
</p>
<p>
In December, Barrasso and Rodgers <a href="https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/12_07_2023_Joint_Letter_to_DOE_LPO_c9ac40dc52.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote a letter</a> citing the scam allegations and demanding related documents from Shah, professing a desire to learn more about “the approval of DOE’s loan guarantee.” The pair have also asked the Energy Department’s inspector general to look into whether <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/12/14/news/sen-barrasso-wants-watchdog-probe-of-green-energy-loans/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shah has shown favoritism</a> to companies linked to the Cleantech Leaders Roundtable, the renewable energy organization he founded and led until he left for the Department of Energy in 2021. (Shah has denied the accusations and said he has “no role to play whatsoever in choosing who gets a loan” and that the decisions are in the hands of staff).
</p>
<p>
Beyond all this being an obvious and stated Solyndra rerun, the “increased scrutiny of the [loans] program could deter potential applicants for funding,” <em>Bloomberg</em> further notes, pointing out that shares of Sunnova dipped 16% in December after Barrasso and Rodgers singled the company out in their letter.
</p>
<p>
However, while analysts generally agreed that the whole situation shows the risk of becoming a political target, Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James &amp; Associates wrote in a <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/how-a-doe-loan-guarantee-put-sunnova-in-republican-crosshairs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research note</a> on the day of the Republicans’ December letter that “we envision minimal risk of any consequences for [Sunnova] in a substantive sense, and view today’s move as an overreaction.”

<h2 id="how-media-help-change-conversation-on-mental-health">How Media Help Change Conversation on Mental Health</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — At a time when growing numbers of young Americans are diagnosed with mental health conditions, media are looking at ways to cover the issue more responsibly.</p>
<p>Data shows a rise in young adults being diagnosed with conditions such as depression or anxiety. But media reports of public incidents involving mental health sometimes use damaging language, experts say.</p>
<p>Terms such as “unhinged” or “erratic” — language used to describe a homeless man killed on the New York subway last year — are held up as poor examples of coverage.</p>
<p>Reporters on the health beat and experts who specialize in mental health say that such terms are damaging for those who have a medical condition and that they can be misleading.</p>
<p>“Media plays an important role in shaping public perception of many things, including mental illness,” said Christine Herman, a freelancer journalist.</p>
<p>Coverage can make it appear as if the illness is a moral failing or lack of character, Herman told VOA.</p>
<p>“Sometimes mental health issues are criminalized in our society,” she said, citing how some news outlets still use terms such as “commit suicide” when reporting on someone who has taken their own life.</p>
<p>The term dates to when suicide was still criminalized in the United States.</p>
<p>“The language we use and the way we describe and talk about mental health conditions can really contribute and shape perception,” Herman said.</p>
<p>Rebecca Brendel, a medical doctor and former president of the American Psychiatric Association, said she believes media plays an important role in explaining health conditions.</p>
<p>“We know that to get treatment and to be healthy, we need to have health literacy,” she told VOA. “We need to have an awareness. We need to have reliable information as consumers of health care and mental health care.”</p>
<p>The late first lady Rosalynn Carter was an early advocate for responsible reporting on mental health. Through the Carter Center, she created a fellowship that offers training to journalists on how to better cover the issue.</p>
<p>“Informed journalists can have a significant impact on public understanding of mental health issues as they shape debate and trends with the words and pictures they convey,” Carter said, as cited by the Center.</p>
<p>When Carter died in November, staff at the Center paid tribute to her legacy.</p>
<p>“She taught generations of journalists how to report about behavioral health in a way that reduces stigma and stimulates understanding and equitable treatment,” a statement read.</p>
<p>Since the fellowship started in 1996, more than 250 journalists have benefited from the program — including Herman.</p>
<p>“It’s important because the type of coverage we do … people in our communities read it, or people across the country read this coverage,” said Herman, who started her career in public radio.</p>
<p>Based in Champaign, Illinois, Herman said that as she started to cover health issues more regularly, her interest in mental health grew.</p>
<p>Her reporting on the obstacles for families trying to access mental health care was recognized with an award last year.</p>
<p>Herman, who serves on the board of the Association of Health Care Journalists, said the most effective reporting is accurate, based on science and puts a focus on the person not the condition.</p>
<p>She advocates for compassionate coverage that includes the voices and perspectives of the people affected.</p>
<p>“These are all things that can help contribute to dismantling stigma and ending discrimination toward people who have mental health conditions in our society,” she said.</p>
<p>Data from the American Psychiatric Association shows 1 in 5 Americans experiences a mental health disorder.</p>
<p>“We know that Americans are struggling with their mental health now more than ever before, following the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Brendel of the American Psychiatric Association. “In fact, in mental health circles, we’ve even called it a twin pandemic, a pandemic of mental health.”</p>
<p>She and Herman say they have seen an improvement in how media reports on mental illness, due in part to the Carter fellowship program.</p>
<p>Having the skills to report in a way “that is both accurate and actionable,” Herman said, ensures coverage that contributes to “better public understanding of these issues and ideally to dismantling stigma.”</p>

<h2 id="solving-time-machines-icloud-drive-blockage">Solving Time Machine’s iCloud Drive Blockage</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: TidBITS blog</p>
After upgrading one of his Macs to macOS 14 Sonoma, Adam Engst ran into problems with Time Machine, which refused to back up until iCloud Drive had finished syncing and continued to balk even after the sync had seemingly finished. The problem? A seldom-used troubleshooting account that also had to finish syncing.

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/08/08/bootstrappingByEngelbart.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I always have multiple tabs open in my outliner. This tab, the one I’m writing into now, is for <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a>. I have one for my development work, general notes, not project-specific. And tabs for all the projects I’ve been working on in the last few days or in some cases weeks or months. From a writing standpoint, it doesn’t matter whether they’re on different sites, the idea of a site is not even in the user interface of my editor. In WordPress it’s everything. The usual caveat: unless I’m missing something. I imagine people use browser tabs to work on more than one document at a time? I keep thinking there’s a lot of stuff we can do to make WordPress work better for writers, I’m trying to be nice about this, but it doesn’t work at all for me as a writer. I want it to work. I still can’t believe there aren’t a dozen different approaches to writing in WordPress. Seems like a fair amount of innovation is possible. I’m a writer who also is a developer. This has been bugging me for the last year or so. Why do I think WordPress is so important? 1. Obviously it has a huge installed base. If there’s an opportunity to create something that even a small number of them would like, it’s worth doing. 2. WordPress is the only product out there that supports <i>all</i> the features of <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>. So If I want lots of outlets for basic text writing, you have to start somewhere. Luckily there’s WordPress, sitting there, ready to be recast as a social media app. If you know me, you know I <i>love</i> puzzles like this. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>

Even the most successful projects have </span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">things that, upon reflection, could have been done better.

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Given the title of this talk, many people might expect I’m going </span></span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">to be analyzing good and bad things in the language. Of course I’ll do some of that, but much more besides, for several reasons.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1" style="font-feature-settings: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-optical-sizing: auto; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variation-settings: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 16px;">

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">First, what’s good and bad in a programming language is largely a </span></span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">matter of opinion rather than fact, despite the certainty with which many people argue about even the most trivial features of Go or any other language.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1" style="font-feature-settings: normal; font-kerning: auto; font-optical-sizing: auto; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variation-settings: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; min-height: 16px;">

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Also, there has already been plenty of discussion about things such as where the newlines go, how nil works, using upper case for export, garbage collection, error handling, and so on.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are certainly things to say there, but little that hasn’t already been said.</span></span>

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">But the real reason I’m going to talk about more than the language is that that’s not what the whole project was about. Our original goal was not to create a new programming language, it was to create a better way to write software. We had issues with the languages we were using</span></span><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">—</span></span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">everyone does, whatever the language</span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-size: 14px; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">—</span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">but the fundamental problems we had were not central to the features of those languages, but rather to the process that had been created for using them to build software at Google.</span>

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">The creation of a new language provided a new path to explore other ideas, but it was only an enabler, not the real point. If it didn’t take 45 minutes to build the binary I was working on at the time, Go would not have happened, but those 45 minutes were not because the compiler was slow, because it wasn’t, or because the language it was written in was bad, because it wasn’t. The slowness arose from other factors.</span></span>

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">And those factors were what we wanted to address: The complexities of building modern server software: controlling dependencies, programming with large teams with changing personnel, ease of maintainability, efficient testing, effective use of multicore CPUs and networking, and so on.</span></span>

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">In short, Go is not just a programming language. Of course it is a </span></span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">programming language, that’s its definition, but its purpose was to help provide a better way to develop high-quality software, at least compared to our environment 14 plus years ago.</span>

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">And that’s still what it’s about today.

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">A few weeks back, when starting to prepare this talk, I had a title </span></span><span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">but little else.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To get me going, I asked people on Mastodon for </span></span><span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">input. A fair few responded, and I noticed a trend in the replies: </span></span><span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">people thought the things we got wrong were all in the language, </span></span><span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">but those we got right were in the larger story, the stuff around </span></span><span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">the language like gofmt and deployment and testing. I find that </span></span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">encouraging, actually. What we were trying to do seems to have had an effect.</span>

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">But it’s worth admitting that we didn’t make clear early on what </span></span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">the true goals were.

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Gofmt showed it could be done well, and today pretty much every language worth using has a standard formatter.

<span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">Google software avoided them almost always, pretty much banning them outright, and the engineers doing the banning cited Ousterhout. This bothered me. I’d been doing concurrency-like things, sometimes without even realizing it, since the 1970s and it seemed powerful to me. But upon reflection it became clear that Ousterhout was making two mistakes. First, he was generalizing beyond the domain he was interested in using threads for, and second, he was mostly complaining about using them through with clumsy low-level packages like pthread, and not about the fundamental idea.</span>

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">It’s a mistake common to engineers everywhere to confuse the solution and the problem like this. Sometimes the proposed solution is harder than the problem it addresses, and it can be hard to see there is an easier path. But I digress.</span></span>

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Looking back, I think it’s fair to say that Go had a significant </span></span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">role in convincing the programming world that concurrency was a powerful tool, especially in the multicore networked world, and that it could be done better than with pthreads.

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Also, Go’s version of concurrency was somewhat novel, at least in the line of languages that led to it, by making goroutines unflavored.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No coroutines, no tasks, no threads, no names, just goroutines.

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">As an aside, because I am often asked about it, let me speak for a </span></span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">minute about async/await.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space" style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">  </span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">It saddens me a bit that the async/await model with its associated style is the way many languages have chosen to support concurrency, but it is definitely a huge improvement over pthreads.</span>

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Compared to goroutines, channels, and select, async/await is easier and smaller for language implementers to build or to retrofit into existing platforms.

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">I think Go shows that CSP, which is a different but older model, </span></span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">fits perfectly into a procedural language without such complication. I’ve even seen it done several times as a library. But its implementation, done well, requires a significant runtime complexity, and I can understand why some folks would prefer not to build that into their system. It’s important, though, whatever concurrency model you provide, to do it exactly once, because an environment providing multiple concurrency implementations can be problematic. Go of course solved that issue by putting it in the language, not a library.</span>

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">On that famous first day in Robert’s and my office, we asked the </span></span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">question of what to do about polymorphism. Ken and I knew from C that qsort could serve as a difficult test case, so the three of us started to talk about how our embryonic language could implement a type-safe sort routine.</span>

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Robert and I came up with the same idea pretty much simultaneously: using methods on types to provide the operations that sort needed. That notion quickly grew into the idea that value types had behaviors, defined as methods, and that sets of methods could provide interfaces that functions could operate on. Go’s interfaces arose pretty much right away.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">That’s something that is not often not acknowledged: Go’s sort is </span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">implemented as a function that operates on an interface.

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">The way interfaces work became not only a distinguishing feature </span></span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">of Go, they became the way we thought about libraries, and generality, and composition.

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">You see, we went down this path at least in part because we had </span></span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">seen too often how generic programming encouraged a way of thinking that tended to focus on types before algorithms. Early abstraction instead of organic design. Containers instead of functions.</span>

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">We defined generic containers in the language proper - maps, slices, arrays, channels - without giving programmers access to the genericity they contained. This was arguably a mistake. We believed, correctly I still think, that most simple programming tasks could be handled just fine by those types. But there are some that cannot, and the barrier between what the language provided and what the user could control definitely bothered some people.</span></span>

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">In short, although I wouldn’t change a thing about how interfaces </span></span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">worked, they colored our thinking in ways it took more than a decade to correct. Ian Taylor pushed us, from early on, to face this problem, but it was quite hard to do given the presence of interfaces as the bedrock of Go programming.</span>

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Critics often complained we should just do generics, because they </span></span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">are “easy”, and perhaps they can be in some languages, but the existence of interfaces meant that any new form of polymorphism had to take them into account. Finding a way forward that worked well with the rest of the language required multiple attempts, several aborted implementations, and many hours, days, and weeks of discussion. Eventually we roped in some type theorists to help out, led by Phil Wadler.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space" style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">  </span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">And even today, with a solid generic model in the language, there are still lingering problems to do with the presence of interfaces as method sets.</span>

<span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">The final answer, as you know, was to design a generalization of </span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">interfaces that could absorb more forms of polymorphism, transitioning from “sets of methods” to “sets of types”.

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">By the way, I wish we had a better term than “generics”, which originated as the term for a different, data-structure-centric style of polymorphism. “Parametric polymorphism” is the proper term for what Go provides, and it’s an accurate one, but it’s an ugly mouthful. But “generics” is what we say, even though it’s not quite right.</span></span>

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">One of the things that bothered the programming language community was that the early Go compiler was written in C. The proper way, in their opinion, was to use LLVM or a similar toolkit, or to write the compiler in Go itself, a process called self-hosting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We didn’t do either of these, for several reasons.</span></span>

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">First, bootstrapping a new language requires that at least the first </span></span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">steps towards its compiler must be done in an existing language. For us, C was the obvious choice, as Ken had written a C compiler </span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">already, and its internals could serve well as the basis of a Go </span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">compiler. Also, writing a compiler in its own language, while </span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">simultaneously developing the language, tends to result in a language that is good for writing compilers, but that was not the kind of language we were after.</span>

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">The early compiler worked. It bootstrapped the language well. But </span></span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">it was a bit of an odd duck, in effect a Plan 9-style compiler using </span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">old ideas in compiler writing, rather than new ones such as static </span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">single assignment.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space" style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">  </span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">The generated code was mediocre, and the internals were not pretty.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space" style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">  </span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">But it was pragmatic and efficient, and the compiler code itself was modest in size and familiar to us, which made it easy to make changes quickly as we tried new ideas. One critical step was the addition of segmented stacks that grew automatically. This was very easy to add to our compiler, but had we been using a toolkit like LLVM, the task of integrating that change into the full compiler suite would have been infeasible, given the required changes to the ABI and garbage collector support.</span>

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Another area that worked well was cross-compilation, which came directly from the way the </span></span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">original Plan 9 compiler suite worked.</span>

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Doing it our way, however unorthodox, helped us move fast. Some people were offended by this choice, but it was the right one for us at the time.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">For Go version 1.5, Russ wrote a tool to translate the compiler </span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">semi-automatically from C to Go. By then the language was complete, and concerns about compiler-directed language design were irrelevant. There are talks online about this process that are worth a look. I gave one talk at GopherCon in 2016 about the assembler, which is something of a high point in my lifelong quest for portability.</span>

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Some projects work differently, accepting code quickly and then </span></span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">cleaning up once it’s been committed. The Go project works the other way around, trying to get the quality first. I believe that’s the more efficient way, but it pushes more work back on the community and they need to understand the value or they will not feel as welcome as they should. There is still much to learn here, but I believe things are much better these days.</span>

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">By the way, there’s a historical detail that’s not widely known. </span></span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">The project has had 4 different content management systems: SVN, Perforce, Mercurial and then Git. Russ did a Herculean job of keeping all the history alive, so even today the Git repo contains the earliest changes as they were made in SVN. We all believe it’s </span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">valuable to keep the history around, and I thank him for doing the </span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">heavy lifting.</span>

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">One other point. People often assume Google tells the Go team what to do. That’s simply not true. Google is incredibly generous in its support for Go, but does not set the agenda. The community has far more input. Google has a huge internal Go code base that the team uses to test and verify releases, but this is done by importing from the public repo into Google, not the other way around. In short, the core Go team is paid by Google but they are independent.</span></span>

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">The process of developing package management for Go was not done well. The package design in the language itself was excellent, I believe, and consumed a large amount of time in the first year or so of our discussions. The SPLASH talk I mentioned earlier explains in detail why it works the way it does if you’re interested.</span></span>

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">A key point was the use of a plain string to specify the path in </span></span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">an import statement, giving a flexibility that we were correct in </span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">believing would be important. But the transition from having only </span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">a “standard library” to importing code from the web was bumpy.</span>

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">First, those of us on the core Go team early on were familiar with how Google worked, with its monorepo and everyone building at head. But we didn’t have enough experience using a package manager with lots of versions of packages and the very difficult problems trying to resolve the dependency graph. To this day, few people really understand the technical complexities, but that is no excuse for our failure to grapple with those problems from the start. It’s especially embarrassing because I had been the tech lead on a failed project to do something similar for Google’s internal build, and I should have realized what we were up against.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">That lesson was learned, though. There are plenty of examples in </span><span style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">the documentation now, mostly provided by open source contributors. And one thing we did very early was make them executable on the web. I gave a talk at Google I/O in 2012 that showed concurrency in action, and Andrew Gerrand wrote a lovely bit of web goo that made it possible to run the snippets right from the browser. I doubt that was the first time it had ever been done, but Go is a compiled language and many in the audience had never seen that trick before. The technology was then deployed to the blog and to the online package documentation.</span>

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Looking back, it’s clear many things were done right, and they all helped Go succeed.

<span class="s1" style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span style="font-family: georgia;">Perhaps the most interesting consequence of these matters is that Go code looks and works the same regardless of who’s writing it, is largely free of factions using different subsets of the language, and is guaranteed to continue to compile and run as time goes on.

<h2 id="houthis-show-no-signs-of-heeding-us-warnings">Houthis Show ‘No Signs’ of Heeding US Warnings</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>pentagon — Houthi militants appear to be ignoring U.S. warnings about their repeated attacks on ships in the Red Sea, launching a naval drone Thursday that came within “a couple of miles” of merchant ships and American combat vessels before detonating.</p>
<p>U.S. naval officials said the so-called unmanned surface vessel was launched from Houthi territory in Yemen and traveled about 50 miles into busy shipping lanes before exploding. They said it is unclear who or what the Houthis were trying to target, adding the explosion did not cause any damage or injuries.</p>
<p>“There are no signs that their irresponsible behavior is abating,” Vice Admiral Brad Cooper, head of U.S. Navy operations in the Middle East, told reporters.</p>
<p>“Shipping lanes in this region are dense,” Cooper said. “These Houthi attacks are, for sure, destabilizing and contrary to international law and clearly, as have as has been articulated by many, must stop immediately.”</p>
<p>Twenty-five attacks since November</p>
<p>Since November, the Iranian-backed Houthis have launched 25 attacks on vessels sailing through the Red Sea, claiming the ships are linked to Israel and that the attacks are in support of Palestinians in Gaza.</p>
<p>In response, the United States, along with France, Britain and nearly 20 other countries launched Operation Prosperity Guardian in mid-December to protect ships from Houthi attacks.</p>
<p>So far, about 1,500 vessels have passed safely through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, with the U.S. and its partners shooting down 11 Houthi drones, six anti-ship ballistic missiles and two cruise missiles. U.S. forces also sunk three Houthi boats Sunday after they attacked a container ship.</p>
<p>“We now have the largest surface and air presence in the southern Red Sea in years,” Cooper said. “And in the coming weeks, we expect additional countries to contribute, which will only strengthen our ability to deter.”</p>
<p>But Cooper also said the five warships and other assets taking part in Operation Prosperity Guardian are “entirely defensive in nature” and are separate from any capabilities that might be used to strike at the Houthis.</p>
<p>US, allies warn Houthis</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the U.S. and 12 allies issued a statement warning the Houthis of unspecified consequences if their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea continue.</p>
<p>“Let our message now be clear: We call for the immediate end of these illegal attacks and release of unlawfully detained vessels and crews,” the statement said.</p>
<p>Signatories on the statement include Britain, which on Monday issued its own warning to the Houthis of “direct action,” as well as Australia, Canada, Germany and Japan.</p>
<p>Late Wednesday, a senior U.S. administration official —briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity — said the Houthis should “not anticipate another warning” from the U.S. or its partners.</p>

<h2 id="police-say-17-year-old-killed-a-sixth-grader-and-wounded-five-in-iowa-school-shooting">Police Say 17-year-old Killed a Sixth-Grader and Wounded Five in Iowa School Shooting</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Perry, Iowa — A 17-year-old opened fire at a small-town Iowa high school on the first day of school after the winter break, killing a sixth-grader and wounding five others as students barricaded in offices and fled in panic.</p>
<p>The suspect, a student at the school in Perry, died of what investigators believe is a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and at least one of the victims is a school administrator, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>The official was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>Perry has about 8,000 residents and is about 64 kilometers northwest of Des Moines, on the edge of the state capital’s metropolitan area. It is home to a large pork-processing plant, and low-slung, single-story homes spread among trees now shorn of their leaves by winter. The high school and middle school are connected, sitting on the east edge of town.</p>
<p>Perry High School senior Ava Augustus said she was waiting in a counselor’s when she heard three shots. She and other people barricaded the door, preparing to throw things, if necessary, with a window being too small for an escape.</p>
<p>“And then we hear ‘He’s down. You can go out,’” Augustus said through tears. “And I run, and you can just see glass everywhere, blood on the floor. I get to my car and they’re taking a girl out of the auditorium who had been shot in her leg.”</p>
<p>Three gunshot victims were taken by ambulance to Iowa Methodist Medical Center in Des Moines, a spokesperson for its health system said. Some other patients were transported to a second hospital in Des Moines, a spokesperson for MercyOne Des Moines Medical Center confirmed, declining to comment on the number of patients or their statuses.</p>
<p>Vigils were planned Thursday evening at a park and a local church. A post on the high school’s Facebook page said it would be closed Friday, with counseling services planned at the public library Friday and Saturday.</p>
<p>In Washington, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland was briefed on the shooting. FBI agents from the Omaha-Des Moines office are assisting with the investigation led by the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation.</p>
<p>The shooting occurred in the backdrop of Iowa’s first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses. Republican candidate Vivek Ramaswamy had a campaign event scheduled in Perry at 9 a.m. about 2.4 kilometers from the high school but canceled it to have a prayer and intimate discussion with area residents.</p>
<p>Mass shootings across the U.S. have long brought calls for stricter gun laws from gun safety advocates, and Thursday’s did within hours. But that idea has been a non-starter for many Republicans, particularly in rural, GOP-leaning states like Iowa.</p>
<p>As of July 2021, Iowa does not require a permit to purchase a handgun or carry a firearm in public, though it mandates a background check for a person buying a handgun without a permit.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy said the shooting is a sign of a “psychological sickness” in the country. In Des Moines, Republican rival and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said that gun violence “is more of a local and state issue” in an interview with the Des Moines Register and NBC News.</p>
<p>The high school in Perry is part of the 1,785-student Perry Community School District. The town is more diverse than Iowa as a whole, with census figures showing that 31% of the residents are Hispanic, compared to less than 7% for the state. Those figures also show that nearly 19% of the town’s residents were born outside the U.S.</p>
<p>An active shooter was reported at 7:37 a.m. Thursday, and officers arrived seven minutes later, Dallas County Sheriff Adam Infante said. Emergency vehicles surrounded the middle and high school.</p>
<p>Zander Shelley, 15, was in a hallway when he heard gunshots and dashed into a classroom, according to his father, Kevin Shelley. Zander was grazed twice and hid in the classroom before texting his father at 7:36 a.m.</p>
<p>Kevin Shelley, who drives a garbage truck, told his boss he had to run.</p>
<p>“It was the most scared I’ve been in my entire life,” he said.</p>
<p>Rachael Kares, an 18-year-old senior, was wrapping up jazz band practice when she and her bandmates heard what she described as four gunshots, spaced apart.</p>
<p>“We all just jumped,” Kares said. “My band teacher looked at us and yelled, ‘Run!’ So, we ran.”</p>
<p>Kares and many others from the school ran out past the football field, as she heard people yelling, “Get out! Get out!” She said she heard additional shots as she ran but didn’t know how many. She was more concerned about getting home to her 3-year-old son.</p>
<p>“At that moment, I didn’t care about anything except getting out, because I had to get home with my son,” she said.</p>

<p>The introduction of the Copilot key marks the first significant change to the Windows PC keyboard in nearly three decades. We believe it will empower people to participate in the AI transformation more easily. The Copilot key joins the Windows key as a core part of the PC keyboard and when pressed, the new key will invoke the Copilot in Windows experience to make it seamless to engage Copilot in your day to day*. Nearly 30 years ago, we introduced the Windows key to the PC keyboard that enabled people all over the world to interact with Windows. We see this as another transformative moment in our journey with Windows where Copilot will be the entry point into the world of AI on the PC. ↫ Yusuf Mehdi on the official Windows blog Your next laptop will come with an “AI” key next to the spacebar. Yes, Microsoft and Windows OEMs are really going to be doing this. Your laptop will come with a dedicated copyright infringement key that will produce utter nonsense and misinformation at the push of a key. This is pure and utter insanity.</p>

Private-sector hiring was stronger than expected in December, according to ADP, and we learned yesterday that there were slightly fewer job openings nationwide in November. But the official government jobs report for December doesn’t come out until tomorrow. What can we expect and what should we make of it all? Also on the show: More consumers opted for cars that are cheaper to buy and operate, and young people in China grapple with a high unemployment rate.

<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>When the AXP64 build tools for Windows 2000 were discovered back in May 2023, there was a crucial problem. Not only was it difficult to test the compiled applications since you needed an exotic and rare DEC Alpha machine running a leaked version of Windows, it was also difficult to even compile the programs, since you needed the same DEC Alpha machine to run the compiler; there was no cross-compiler. As a result, I began writing a program conceptually similar to WOW64 on Itanium (or WX86, or FX-32), only in reverse, to allow RISC Win32 programs to run on x86. ↫ CaptainWillStarblazer People with this much skill just exist.</p>

A bill in the California Legislature would create a first-of-its-kind agency in charge of administering economic reparations for slavery, which could be voted on this year. Recommendations start “with those folks who are clearly descendants of 250 years of wage theft in this country,” said Sen. Steven Bradford, who introduced the legislation. Also, some shipping rates have more than doubled for routes in the Red Sea.

<li>Offshore wind sees a turbulent start to 2024
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>“The rollercoaster that is the U.S. offshore wind industry is already racing in 2024,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e2b059d177&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says</a> Canary Media’s Maria Gallucci. Indeed, after missing an end-of-year deadline to start sending energy to the U.S. grid, the nation’s first large-scale offshore wind farm <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=30947574c4&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">came online</a> at 11:52 p.m. on Tuesday, delivering five megawatts of power to the New England grid. The Vineyard Wind 1 project, located near Martha’s Vineyard, will eventually consist of 62 turbines capable of powering 400,000 homes in Massachusetts.<br/><br/>“The arrival of Vineyard Wind is a welcome tonic to a nascent offshore wind industry that has struggled in the US in recent months,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=de81dc97be&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writes</a> Oliver Milman at <em>The Guardian</em>. But on Wednesday, BP and Equinor abandoned a contract to sell offshore wind energy to the state of New York, citing the familiar headwinds of rising costs, interest rates, and supply chain problems. Last October the companies tried to negotiate with the state for higher rates for selling renewable energy credits. Their request was turned down, only for the state to open the floor to new project proposals, including from BP and Equinor. “The agreement is the latest evidence of the malaise engulfing the fledgling offshore US wind industry,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=08965433c8&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writes</a> Myles McCormick at the <em>Financial Times</em>, “but also illustrates the willingness of state authorities to provide flexibility to prevent projects from being abandoned.”

<strong></strong>Some important renewable energy news went under the radar this week: Pattern Energy’s SunZia Transmission line <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=183ddde20f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">secured</a> $11 billion in financing, which means construction can continue on the “largest clean energy infrastructure project in U.S. history.” The 550-mile high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission line will run between central New Mexico and south-central Arizona, delivering power to western states from the SunZia Wind facility being built in New Mexico. “The size and scale of both the SunZia project and this multifaceted financing show that the renewable energy space can secure attractive capital at levels previously only seen in traditional generation,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=14b93700a6&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says</a> Daniel Elkort, executive vice president at Pattern Energy.<br/><br/>Upgrading transmission systems will be key to meeting the Biden administration’s goal of eliminating carbon emissions from the power sector by 2035: By one <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=25ff664daa&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimate</a>, transmission systems will need to expand by 60% by 2030. The SunZia Transmission line will be able to move 3,000 megawatts of wind power to 3 million people and has been <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d0f1b829ae&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called</a> “bigger than the Hoover Dam.” But its progress has been rocky: Indigenous groups have expressed concerns about the line’s impact on religious and cultural sites, and environmentalists worried it could harm wildlife habitat.

For the project, researchers led by Google-backed nonprofit Global Fishing Watch used artificial intelligence to analyze huge amounts of offshore data from satellite imagery. They found that many industrial vessels aren’t publicly tracked, exposing a potential blindspot for conservation efforts. The data also showed that offshore wind turbines now outnumber oil structures:

<li>GOP climate advocate John Curtis launches Senate bid
</h3>
<p>
Utah Rep. John Curtis announced this week he is running for the Senate seat left vacant by retiring Sen. Mitt Romney. The primary field is likely to be crowded, but Curtis’s entry is interesting because he is “one of the GOP’s leading voices on fighting climate change,” says E&amp;E News. He launched and chairs the Conservative Climate Caucus, has supported some of the Biden administration’s policies on solar, and attended COP28 to push for permitting reform. But it will be interesting to see whether climate change features prominently in his campaign: Curtis didn’t mention environmental issues in his first campaign video but pledged to “work to make America not just energy independent, but energy dominant.”

<li>Researchers hope volcanic magma could provide ‘quantum leap’ in geothermal energy
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Researchers in Iceland have plans to drill into a magma chamber beneath a volcano in an attempt to better understand the hot molten rock and eventually even “make a quantum leap in geothermal energy production,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=43fe69e551&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a><em> New Scientist</em>. The Krafla Magma Testbed (KMT) project will start drilling in 2026, focusing on a volcano called Krafla in north-east Iceland. The researchers hope to develop near-magma geothermal energy technology that would allow wells to trap hot, pressurized water to drive turbines and produce cheap, clean electricity. “There are endless opportunities,” says Hjalti Páll Ingólfsson at the Geothermal Research Cluster (GEORG) in Reykjavík. “The only thing we need to do is to learn how to tame this monster.”

<p>date: 2024-01-04, updated: 2023-12-28, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Kaspersky researchers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/12/exploit-used-in-mass-iphone-infection-campaign-targeted-secret-hardware-feature/#p3">are detailing</a> “an attack that over four years backdoored dozens if not thousands of iPhones, many of which belonged to employees of Moscow-based security firm Kaspersky.” It’s a zero-click exploit that makes use of four iPhone zero-days.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The most intriguing new detail is the targeting of the heretofore-unknown hardware feature, which proved to be pivotal to the Operation Triangulation campaign. A zero-day in the feature allowed the attackers to bypass advanced <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/operating-system-integrity-sec8b776536b/web">hardware-based memory protections</a> designed to safeguard device system integrity even after an attacker gained the ability to tamper with memory of the underlying kernel.

<h2 id="year-old-gamer-first-to-beat-unbeatable-tetris">13-Year-Old Gamer First to Beat ‘Unbeatable’ Tetris</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO — The falling-block video game Tetris has met its match in 13-year-old Willis Gibson, who has become the first player to officially “beat” the original Nintendo version of the game — by breaking it.</p>
<p>Technically, Willis — aka “blue scuti” in the gaming world — made it to what gamers call a “kill screen,” a point where the Tetris code glitches, crashing the game. That might not sound like much of a victory to anyone thinking that only high scores count, but it’s a highly coveted achievement in the world of video games, where records involve pushing hardware and software to their limits. And beyond.</p>
<p>It’s also a very big deal for players of Tetris, which many had long considered unbeatable. That’s partly because the game doesn’t have a scripted ending; those four-block shapes just keep falling no matter how good you get at stacking them into disappearing rows. Top players continued to find ways to extend their winning streaks by staying in the game to reach higher and higher levels, but in the end, the game beat them all.</p>
<p>Until, that is, Willis managed on Dec. 21 to trigger a kill screen on Level 157, which the gaming world takes as a victory over the game — something along the lines of pushing the software past its own limits.</p>
<p>The makers of Tetris agree. “Congratulations to ‘blue scuti’ for achieving this extraordinary accomplishment, a feat that defies all preconceived limits of this legendary game,” Tetris CEO Maya Rogers said in a statement. Rogers noted that Tetris will celebrate its 40th anniversary this year and called Willis’ victory a “monumental achievement.”</p>
<p>It’s been a very long road. Early on, “the Tetris scene people didn’t even know how to get to these higher levels,” said David Macdonald, a gaming YouTuber who has chronicled the gaming industry for years. “They were just stuck in the 20s and 30s because they just didn’t know techniques to get any further.” Level 29 posed an especially tough roadblock because the blocks began falling more quickly than the in-game controller could respond.</p>
<p>Eventually players found ways to make progress, as Macdonald chronicled in his detailed video on Willis victory. In 2011, one got to Level 30 using a technique called “hypertapping,” in which a player could rhythmically vibrate their fingers to move the game controller faster than the game’s built-in speed. That technique took players to level 35 by 2018, after which they hit a wall.</p>
<p>The next big thing came in 2020 when a gamer combined a multifinger technique originally used on arcade video games with a finger positioned on the bottom of the controller to push it against another finger on the top. Called “rolling,” this much speedier approach helped one player reach Level 95 in 2022.</p>
<p>Then other obstacles arose. Because the original Tetris developers had never counted on players pushing the game’s limits so aggressively, bizarre quirks began to crop up at higher levels. One particularly difficult issue arose with the game’s color palette, which traditionally cycled through 10 easily distinguished patterns. Starting at level 138, though, random color combinations began to appear — some of which made it much harder to distinguish the blocks from the game’s black background.</p>
<p>Two particularly devilish patterns — one a dim combination of dark blues and greens later dubbed “Dusk,” the other composed of black, gray and white blocks called “Charcoal” — proved taxing for players. When combined with the strain of increasingly longer games, which could run 40 minutes or more, progress slowed again. It took a Tetris-playing AI program dubbed StackRabbit to break that logjam by helping map out just where players might happen across a glitch resulting in a kill screen, and finally beat the game.</p>
<p>StackRabbit, which managed to make it all the way to Level 237 before crashing the game, ran on a modified version of Tetris, so its achievements aren’t strictly comparable to those of human players. And its findings weren’t immediately applicable to the human-played game, either. But its runs clearly demonstrated that game-ending glitches could be triggered by very specific events, such as which block pieces were in play or how many lines a player cleared at once.</p>
<p>That let human players take over the task of mapping all possible scenarios that could cause such crashes in the original game. These typically resulted when the game’s decade-old code lost its place and began reading its next instructions from the wrong location, generally resulting in garbage input.</p>
<p>A massive effort spurred by StackRabbit’s experience eventually led to the compilation of a large spreadsheet that detailed which game levels and which specific conditions were most likely to lead to a crash.</p>
<p>That’s what compelled Willis to make his run for the record.</p>
<p>Yet even he appeared shocked when he crashed the game at Level 157. In his livestream video, he appears to hyperventilate before barely gasping “Oh my God” several times, clutching his temples and worrying that he might be passing out. After cupping his hands over his mouth in an apparent attempt to regulate his breathing, he finally exclaims, “I can’t feel my fingers.”</p>

<p>AUSTIN, Texas — The Justice Department on Wednesday sued Texas over a new law that would allow police to arrest migrants who enter the U.S. illegally, taking Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to court again over his escalating response to border crossers arriving from Mexico.</p>
<p>The lawsuit draws Texas into another clash over immigration at a time when New York and Chicago are pushing back on buses and planes carrying migrants sent by Abbott to Democrat-led cities nationwide. Texas is also fighting separate court battles to keep razor wire on the border and a floating barrier in the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>But a law Abbott signed last month poses a broader and bigger challenge to the U.S. government’s authority over immigration. In addition to allowing police anywhere in Texas to arrest migrants on charges of illegal entry, the law — known as Senate Bill 4 — also gives judges the authority to order migrants to leave the country.</p>
<p>The lawsuit asks a federal court in Austin to declare the Texas law unconstitutional. It calls the measure a violation of the Supremacy Clause, which establishes that federal laws in most cases supersede state law. </p>
<p>“Texas cannot run its own immigration system,” the Justice Department states in the lawsuit. “Its efforts, through SB 4, intrude on the federal government’s exclusive authority to regulate the entry and removal of noncitizens, frustrate the United States’ immigration operations and proceedings, and interfere with U.S. foreign relations.”</p>
<p>Abbott’s office did not respond to an email seeking comment.</p>
<p>“Biden sued me today because I signed a law making it illegal for an illegal immigrant to enter or attempt to enter Texas directly from a foreign nation.” Abbott said in a post on X, formerly Twitter. “I like my chances.”</p>
<p>The law is scheduled to take effect in March. Civil rights organizations and officials in El Paso County, Texas, filed a lawsuit last month that similarly described the new law as unconstitutional overreach.</p>
<p>The Justice Department sent Abbott a letter last week threatening legal action unless Texas reversed course. In response, Abbott posted on X that the Biden administration “not only refuses to enforce current U.S. immigration laws, they now want to stop Texas from enforcing laws against illegal immigration.”</p>
<p>On Wednesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson and about 60 fellow Republicans visited the Texas border city of Eagle Pass, which has been the center of Abbott’s $10 billion border initiative known as Operation Lone Star. Johnson suggested he could use a looming government funding deadline as further leverage for hard-line border policies.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden has expressed willingness to make policy compromises because the number of migrants crossing the border is an increasing challenge for his 2024 reelection campaign. Johnson praised Abbott, who was not in Eagle Pass, and slammed the lawsuits that seek to undo Texas’ aggressive border measures.</p>
<p>“It’s absolute insanity,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>Illegal crossings along the southern U.S. border topped 10,000 on several days in December, a number that U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Troy Miller called “unprecedented.” U.S. authorities closed cargo rail crossings in Eagle Pass and El Paso for five days last month, calling it a response to a large number of migrants riding freight trains through Mexico to the border.</p>
<p>Authorities this week also resumed full operations at a bridge in Eagle Pass and other crossings in San Diego and Arizona that had been temporarily closed.</p>
<p>Legal experts and opponents say Texas’ new law is the most far-reaching attempt by a state to police immigration since a 2010 Arizona law that was partially struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. That law had made it a state crime to be in the U.S. without legal status and gave police some immigration enforcement powers. A Supreme Court ruling in 2012 affirmed that immigration enforcement is solely within the authority of the federal government.</p>
<p>Under the Texas law, migrants could either agree to a Texas judge’s order to leave the U.S. or be prosecuted on misdemeanor charges of illegal entry. Migrants who don’t leave could face arrest again under more serious felony charges.</p>
<p>Those ordered to leave would be sent to ports of entry along the border with Mexico, even if they are not Mexican citizens. The law can be enforced anywhere in Texas but some places are off-limits, including schools and churches.</p>
<p>For more than two years, Texas has run a smaller-scale operation on the border to arrest migrants on misdemeanor charges of trespassing. Although that was also intended to stem illegal crossings, there is little indication that it has done so.</p>

<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Tokyo — The black box from an Osprey military aircraft that crashed off Japan in November with eight people on board has been recovered, the US military said Thursday, five weeks after the accident.</p>
<p>“Critical equipment identified by investigation officials has been recovered, including the Voice and Data Recorder, often called the black box,” U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command spokesperson Rebecca Heyse said.</p>
<p>“The equipment will be transported to laboratories for data retrieval with follow analysis of the data at AFSOC. We expect the analysis process to take several weeks,” Heyse said by email.</p>
<p>Seven bodies had previously been recovered and Heyse said the search for the eighth crewmember was ongoing.</p>
<p>The aircraft crashed in waters off southern Japan on November 29.</p>
<p>The Osprey, which can operate like a helicopter or a fixed-wing turboprop plane, has suffered a string of fatal accidents in recent years.</p>

<h2 id="us-imam-shot-outside-new-jersey-mosque-dies">US Imam Shot Outside New Jersey Mosque Dies</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — An imam who was shot Wednesday outside a mosque in New Jersey has died, the US state’s attorney general said, adding that the killing did not initially appear to be driven by “bias” or domestic terrorism.</p>
<p>Hassan Sharif was shot multiple times near a mosque in Newark, just west of New York, before being taken to hospital where he later died, New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin said.</p>
<p>“We do not yet know the motivation for this crime (but) the evidence collected thus far does not indicate that this was an act motivated by bias, or an act of domestic terrorism,” said Platkin.</p>
<p>He added that “in light of global events, and with a rise in bias that many communities are experiencing across our state — particularly the Muslim community — there are many in New Jersey right now who are feeling a heightened sense of fear.”</p>
<p>The state is home to 300,000 Muslim Americans, he said.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, there has been an increase in Islamophobic and anti-Semitic attacks across the United States.</p>
<p>The Essex County prosecutor, Ted Stephens, confirmed Sharif was shot more than once, and that “it does not appear the imam was the victim of a bias crime or that this is related to terrorism.”</p>
<p>“We are dedicated to bringing justice for the imam’s family,” said Stephens, who called it a “dastardly crime.”</p>
<p>The U.S. Transportation Security Administration earlier confirmed that Sharif had worked as a security screener at Newark airport since 2016.</p>
<p>“We are deeply saddened to learn of his passing and send our condolences to his family, friends and colleagues,” said Lisa Farbstein, a TSA spokeswoman.</p>
<p>Images published by the New Jersey chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) showed police vehicles deployed outside the Masjid Muhammad-Newark, a two-story yellow and green complex.</p>
<p>In a statement, CAIR described Sharif as “a beacon of leadership and excellence.”</p>
<p>“As always, and irrespective of this specific incident, we advise all mosques to keep their doors open but remain cautious especially given the recent spike in anti-Muslim bigotry,” the organization said.</p>

<h2 id="more-us-hospitals-requiring-masks-as-flu-covid-19-cases-surge">More US Hospitals Requiring Masks as Flu, COVID-19 Cases Surge</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — More U.S. hospitals are requiring masks and limiting visitors as health officials face an expected but still nasty post-holiday spike in flu, COVID-19 and other illnesses.</p>
<p>While many experts say this season likely won’t prove to be as deadly as some other recent winters, it still could mean hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations and many thousands of deaths across the country.</p>
<p>New York City last week instituted a mask mandate for the city’s 11 public hospitals. Similar measures were ordered last week at some hospitals in Los Angeles and Massachusetts. Some hospitals reinstated masking rules for employees months ago, in anticipation of a seasonal rush of sick people.</p>
<p>Flu and COVID-19 infections have been increasing for weeks, with high levels of flu-like illness reported in 31 states just before Christmas. Updated national numbers are to be released Friday, but health officials predict infections will grow in many states well into January.</p>
<p>“What we’re seeing right now, in the first week of January, is really an acceleration — of flu cases, in particular,” said Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>There is some good news. Flu and COVID-19 cases may peak by the end of the month and then drop, Cohen said. Though the flu has been skyrocketing, this year’s cases are being caused by a strain that usually doesn’t cause as many deaths and hospitalizations as some other versions. What’s more, signs suggest current flu vaccines are well-matched to the strain.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s going to be overwhelming,” said Dr. William Schaffner, Vanderbilt University infectious diseases expert. He deemed the current season “moderately severe.”</p>
<p>The CDC is pointing the public to an agency website where people can look up their county, which can help them make decisions about whether to wear masks or take other precautions. Cohen urged people to get vaccinated and to seek treatment for flu and COVID-19.</p>
<p>Vaccinations are down this year, officials say. About 44% of U.S. adults had gotten flu shots by Dec. 23, according to the most recently available CDC vaccination survey data. Only about 19% of U.S. adults were reported to have received an updated COVID-19 shot as of early December.</p>
<p>COVID-19 cases are causing more severe disease than the flu but have been rising less dramatically. Health officials are keeping an eye on JN.1, a new version of the ever-evolving coronavirus. The omicron variant was first detected in the U.S. in September and just before Christmas accounted for an estimated 44% of COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>The JN.1 variant may spread easier or be better at evading our immune systems, but there is no evidence that it causes more severe disease than other recent variants, health officials say. Current evidence indicates vaccines and antiviral medications work against it.</p>
<p>The CDC also has reported disappointing vaccination rates against another seasonal bug, respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. That is a common cause of mild cold-like symptoms, but it can be dangerous for infants and older people. RSV cases rose in the fall but appear to have plateaued and are even going down in some places, according to the latest data.</p>
<p>At Hillsdale Hospital in southern Michigan, a 65% increase in respiratory illness activity in late December triggered a limitation to visitors in the birthing center. Only a spouse, a support person and grandparents can visit. They all must wear a mask and not show symptoms of sickness.</p>
<p>The restriction is common for the hospital around this time of year, said Dr. Nichole Ellis, a pediatrician who is the hospital’s medical chief of staff. But it’s more difficult this season, she added.</p>
<p>“In the past, we would have one … disease that we were tracking or monitoring at one time,” Ellis said. “But now, babies and children will have multiple diseases at the same time. It’s not that they just have RSV … but they’re getting RSV and COVID at the same time, or influenza and RSV at the same time because all of the diseases are prevalent in our community.”</p>

<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Facebook recently rolled out a new “Link History” setting that creates a special repository of all the links you click on in the Facebook mobile app. You can opt out if you’re proactive, but the company is pushing Link History on users, and the data is used for targeted ads. As lawmakers introduce tech regulations and Apple and Google beef up privacy restrictions, Meta is doubling down and searching for new ways to preserve its data harvesting empire. The company pitches Link History as a useful tool for consumers “with your browsing activity saved in one place,” rather than another way to keep tabs on your behavior. With the new setting you’ll “never lose a link again,” Facebook says in a pop-up encouraging users to consent to the new tracking method. The company goes on to mention that “When you allow link history, we may use your information to improve your ads across Meta technologies.” The app keeps the toggle switched on in the pop-up, steering users towards accepting Link History unless they take the time to look carefully. ↫ Thomas Germain at Gizmodo As more and more people in the technology press who used to be against Facebook have changed their tune since the launch of Facebook’s Threads – the tech press needs eyeballs in one place for ad revenue, and with Twitter effectively dead, Threads is its replacement – it’s easy to forget just what a sleazy, slimy, and disgusting company Facebook really is.</p>

<h2 id="unsealed-records-offer-new-detail-on-jeffrey-epstein-sex-abuse-allegations">Unsealed Records Offer New Detail on Jeffrey Epstein Sex Abuse Allegations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Amid great hype, a new batch of previously secret court documents was unsealed late Wednesday related to Jeffrey Epstein, the jet-setting financier who killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.</p>
<p>Social media has been rife in recent weeks with posts speculating the documents amounted to a list of rich and powerful men who were Epstein’s “clients” or “co-conspirators.”</p>
<p>There was no such list. The first 40 documents in the court-ordered release largely consisted of already public material revealed through nearly two decades of newspaper stories, TV documentaries, interviews, legal cases and books about the Epstein scandal.</p>
<p>Still, the records — including transcripts of interviews with some Epstein’s victims and old police reports — contained reminders that Epstein surrounded himself with famous and powerful figures, including a few who have also been accused of misconduct.</p>
<p>There were mentions of Epstein’s past friendship with Bill Clinton — who is not accused of any wrongdoing — and of Britain’s Prince Andrew, who previously settled a lawsuit accusing him of having sex with a 17-year-old girl who traveled with Epstein.</p>
<p>Epstein accuser Johanna Sjoberg testified in a newly released deposition that she once met Michael Jackson at Epstein’s Palm Beach, Florida, home, but that nothing untoward happened with the late pop icon.</p>
<p>The documents being unsealed are related to a lawsuit filed in 2015 by one of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Giuffre.</p>
<p>She is one of dozens of women who sued Epstein for abusing them at his homes in Florida, New York, the U.S. Virgin Islands and New Mexico. This suit was against Epstein’s former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison term for helping recruit and abuse Epstein’s victims.</p>
<p>Epstein, a millionaire known for associating with celebrities, politicians, billionaires and academic stars, killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.</p>
<p>Giuffre’s lawsuit was settled in 2017, but the court had kept some documents blacked-out or sealed because of concerns about the privacy rights of Epstein’s victims and others whose names had come up during the legal battle. More documents were to be released in coming days.</p>
<p>Among newly unsealed records were court memos in which Giuffre’s lawyers complained that some women who had worked for Epstein were proving difficult to serve with subpoenas, as was Epstein himself. Two of those women had invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when questioned in other lawsuits about whether they had helped procure young women for Epstein to abuse.</p>
<p>Maxwell, in her deposition, chaffed at being asked about Giuffre’s allegations that she had arranged for her to have sexual encounters with Prince Andrew. She also reacted angrily to being asked about whether she had purchased sex toys or revealing outfits, or seen young, topless women at Epstein’s home.</p>
<p>One former member of Epstein’s domestic staff said in a deposition that he felt uncomfortable with the number of young women showing up at the house, and felt threatened by Maxwell to stay quiet after he quit.</p>
<p>Other documents included legal arguments over whether Giuffre should be allowed more time to depose potential witnesses, including Clinton. Giuffre never alleged he was involved in illegal behavior, but her attorneys said the former president was a “key person who can provide information about his close relationship” with Maxwell and Epstein.</p>
<p>Maxwell’s attorneys countered that Clinton testimony was not relevant and that Giuffre’s attorneys didn’t diligently try to subpoena him to testify.</p>
<p>The records included depositions of several Epstein victims, many of whom have told their stories publicly previously.</p>
<p>In her May 2016 deposition, Sjoberg described going to a dinner at one of Epstein’s homes with the magician David Copperfield.</p>
<p>She said Copperfield did magic tricks before asking if she was aware “that girls were getting paid to find other girls.” One of the key allegations against Epstein and Maxwell was that some of the girls he paid for sex acts then acted as recruiters to find him other victims. Sjoberg said Copperfield didn’t get more specific about what he meant.</p>
<p>A publicist for Copperfield did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.</p>
<p>Sjoberg also shed new light on an April 2001 trip to New York in which she said Prince Andrew touched her breast while they posed for a photo at Epstein’s Manhattan town house.</p>
<p>In the testimony, some of which appeared as excerpts in previous court filings, Sjoberg said she and Giuffre had flown with Epstein to New York on his private jet. Maxwell and Prince Andrew met them there, she said.</p>
<p>At one point, she testified, Maxwell called her to an upstairs closet where they pulled out a puppet of Prince Andrew that had been made for a television program.</p>
<p>“It looked like him,” Sjoberg said. “And she brought it down and presented it to him; and that was a great joke, because apparently it was a production from a show on BBC.”</p>
<p>“And they decided to take a picture with it, in which Virginia and Andrew sat on a couch. They put the puppet on Virginia’s lap, and I sat on Andrew’s lap, and they put the puppet’s hand on Virginia’s breast, and Andrew put his hand on my breast, and they took a photo.”</p>
<p>On the way to New York, Sjoberg testified, Epstein’s jet diverted to Atlantic City, New Jersey, and spent a few hours at one of Donald Trump’s casinos, because of bad weather.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the change of plans, Sjoberg recalled Epstein saying, “Great, we’ll call up Trump and we’ll go to” the casino. Sjoberg wasn’t asked if they’d met up with Trump that night. Later in her testimony, she said she was never asked to give Trump a massage.</p>
<p>Sjoberg also testified that though she never met Clinton, Epstein once remarked to her that “Clinton likes them young,” a remark she took as a reference to young women or girls.</p>
<p>In her deposition, Giuffre said the summer she turned 17, she was lured away from a job as a spa attendant at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club to become a “masseuse” for Epstein — a job that involved performing sexual acts.</p>
<p>She settled a lawsuit against Prince Andrew in 2022 in which she claimed he had sexually abused her during a trip to London. That same year, Giuffre withdrew an accusation she had made against Epstein’s former attorney, law professor Alan Dershowitz, saying she “ may have made a mistake ” in identifying him as an abuser.</p>
<p>The records released Wednesday included many references to Jean-Luc Brunel, a French modeling agent close to Epstein who was awaiting trial on charges that he raped underage girls when he killed himself in a Paris jail in 2022. Giuffre was among the women who had accused Brunel of sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Clinton’s name also came up because Giuffre was questioned by Maxwell’s lawyers about inaccuracies in newspaper reports about her time with Epstein, including a story quoting her as saying she had ridden in a helicopter with Clinton and flirted with Trump. Giuffre said neither of those things actually happened.</p>
<p>The judge said a handful of names should remain blacked out in the documents because they would identify people who were sexually abused. The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they decide to tell their stories publicly, as Giuffre has done.</p>
<p>Even before the documents were released, misinformation about what was in them abounded. Social media users wrongly claimed that late-night host Jimmy Kimmel’s name might appear in the documents, spurred by a crack New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers made Tuesday on ESPN’s “The Pat McAfee Show.”</p>
<p>Kimmel said in a response on X that he had never met Epstein and that Rodgers’ “reckless words put my family in danger.”</p>

<h2 id="american-victims-of-hamas-attack-on-israel-plan-to-sue-north-korea">American Victims of Hamas Attack on Israel Plan to Sue North Korea</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Tel Aviv/Washington, DC — Families of Americans killed and injured in Hamas’ October 7 terror attack in Israel are contemplating a lawsuit against North Korea for indirectly supplying the Palestinian militant group with weapons, according to an Israeli attorney representing the families.</p>
<p>Weapons that Hamas used in its surprise attack on Israel were provided by North Korea “knowingly and intentionally,” said Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, an Israeli attorney and human rights activist who spoke with VOA’s Korean Service in Tel Aviv on December 27.</p>
<p>“North Korea knows its weapons go to Iran, and Iran gives the weapons to Hamas,” Darshan-Leitner continued, adding that Pyongyang “never once warned Iran not to send the weapons to Hamas.”</p>
<p>This makes North Korea “liable,” she said, explaining that she and her legal associates are considering filing a lawsuit in U.S. court against those countries that supported Hamas, such as Iran and North Korea, on behalf of American victims of the October 7 attack and their families. </p>
<p>More than 30 Americans, many of them dual U.S.-Israeli citizens, were killed in the attack that initiated the latest round of violence between Hamas and Israel.</p>
<p>Darshan-Leitner is representing 10 Americans, including family members who lost their loved ones, as well as U.S. citizens who were injured or who incurred property damage in the attack.</p>
<p>VOA’s Korean Service contacted the North Korean mission to the U.N. seeking a response to a possible lawsuit against the regime by the American victims of the Hamas attack, but it did not respond.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The attorney said she expects more U.S. victims to join the suit, including hostages seized in October if they return safely.</p>
<p>“The burden is on us, the plaintiffs, to prove the case,” Darshan-Leitner said. “We are using experts who know a lot about North Korea, know how North Korean weapons wound up in the hands of Hamas.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>North Korean weapons have been found in Israel and Gaza since the attack on October 7. An Israeli military official said during a media tour in October that about 10% of the Hamas weapons recovered after the attack were made in North Korea.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Idan Sharon-Kettler, deputy commander of the Israel Defense Forces’ (IDF) enemy equipment collection unit, told VOA’s Korean Service on December 28 in Tzrifin, Israel, that Hamas modified North Korea’s rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) to make them more powerful.</p>
<p>“We see supplies coming from different countries, among them, North Korea,” said Sharon-Kettler at an IDF facility where recovered weapons were displayed.</p>
<p>“The rockets that we find, even the ones that are produced inside Gaza or the ones that are produced in Iran — all of the RPG-7s, for example — are using parts that come from North Korea,” said Sharon-Kettler.</p>
<p>He said the rockets were assembled with North Korean rocket engines, which give them capabilities to “penetrate heavy armor” and cause greater damage.</p>
<p>Darshan-Leiter said the rockets give Hamas the ability to attack civilians without being inside Israel.</p>
<p>“Once Israel built a fence around Gaza, Hamas terrorists can no longer go into Israel and carry out attacks inside,” she said. Before Hamas breached the border fence on October 7, “the only way that Hamas could kill Israeli people is by these rockets.”</p>
<p>Normally, foreign states are immune from being sued in a U.S. court under the Foreign Service Immunities Act, unless an exception applies. But if a foreign state is listed as a state-sponsored terrorist group, U.S. citizens can bring a lawsuit against that country.</p>
<p>In November 2017, North Korea was redesignated as a state sponsor of terrorism after being taken off the list in 2008. It was first designated in 1988 for blowing up a Korean Airline passenger flight in mid-air the previous year, killing all 115 people aboard.</p>
<p>North Korea was sued a number of times over the past several years. The most notable was a suit brought against the regime by the parents of Otto Warmbier, an American student who in 2017 died shortly after returning to the U.S. in a vegetative state following detention in North Korea.</p>
<p>A judge from a D.C. federal court ruled in 2018 that Cindy and Fred Warmbier were entitled to $500 million in damages from North Korea.</p>
<p>In October, a federal court in New York ordered the New York Mellon Bank to turn over to Cindy and Fred Warmbier approximately $2.2 million in frozen funds originally owned by a sanctioned Russian bank where North Korea’s Air Koryo kept an account.</p>
<p>In another case, Americans who were injured and the family members of U.S. citizens killed in an attack at the Lod Airport in 1972 — now Ben Gurion International Airport, near Tel Aviv — filed a complaint against North Korea in 2022.</p>
<p>According to court documents, they are seeking damages from North Korea for its role in sponsoring the attack.</p>
<p>The attack killed 26 people and injured 80 and was carried out by three members of the Japanese Red Army who were reportedly recruited by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.</p>
<p>The U.S. designated the group as a terrorist organization in 1997 but revoked the designation in 2001 when the group disbanded.</p>

<h2 id="bidens-unfinished-climate-agenda">Biden’s Unfinished Climate Agenda</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDk5NDcwOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMjg5Mjg1MH0.mVu_9PrBkyU-AKzE3WBAG_qXyxQxgjShQTKtBJlaFqw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
If President Biden chose to sit on his hands for the remainder of his term, he would already have done far more to address climate change than any of his predecessors. But he still has a bunch of unfinished business — half-completed rules that will need to be finalized — that could go a long way toward making sure his initial achievements pay off. And he’s only got a few more months to get it done.
</p>
<p>
The most consequential items on his to-do list are finalizing two sets of regulations that his administration proposed last spring. The first would require most new cars sold in the U.S., and one-quarter of new heavy-duty trucks, to be electric by 2032; the second would drive more rapid reductions of emissions from the power sector and encourage a shift to renewables. The problem is that if the rules aren’t finalized by the end of this spring, they will be <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/why-the-epa-suddenly-came-alive" target="_self">vulnerable to repeal</a> if Republicans win a trifecta in Washington in the fall.
</p>
<p>
Biden’s biggest climate wins to date have been in the form of incentives, not requirements. The Inflation Reduction Act, the crowning achievement of his presidency, has made hundreds of billions of dollars available to build renewable energy and lower the cost of electric vehicles. Economic <a href="https://rhg.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Taking-Stock-2023_Rhodium-Group.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">modeling by the Rhodium Group</a>, a clean energy research firm, shows that these voluntary incentives make renewable energy so cost-effective that electricity-related emissions could decline by up to 75% from today’s levels by 2035 and transportation emissions could drop by up to 32%.
</p>
<p>
The operative word, however, is “voluntary.” Just because clean energy and electric vehicles are cheaper doesn’t mean they’ll be adopted with any urgency. Models assume the world optimizes for the best economic outcome, when in reality, there are many non-monetary factors at play — including, simply, resistance to change. The EPA’s rules are a backstop — they are the “sticks” to complement the “carrots” of the IRA.
</p>
<p>
“The incentives and the standards reinforce one another,” David Doniger, director of the climate and clean energy program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told me. “You can’t be sure you’ll get the results with just the incentives. And at the same time, the incentives buy down the costs of the standards that lock in the results. So it’s a very good combination.”
</p>
<p>
Many environmental groups say the EPA proposals need to be strengthened before they are finalized. “Even if Biden gets elected into the second term, we won’t have the opportunity to open up these rules again,” Rachel Patterson, the deputy policy director of Evergreen Action, told me. For example, only certain kinds of new natural gas plants are covered by the rules, whereas the group wants to see all new fossil fuel plants covered. It is also pushing the agency to require a more rapid transition to electric heavy duty trucks — or at least one in line with <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/advanced-clean-trucks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rules already in place in California</a>.
</p>
<p>
Patterson said these rules aren’t just urgent from a climate perspective. “Getting dirty vehicles off the road is going to improve people’s lives through cleaner air, through reduced pollution and health impacts. The same goes for clean power rules.”
</p>
<p>
The EPA’s <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaMain?operation=OPERATION_GET_AGENCY_RULE_LIST¤tPub=true&agencyCode=&showStage=active&agencyCd=2000&csrf_token=87C87FE6BEC02A489F1FC03011709590326E110804741E74D39EADF19315253FFE167B13752997D5927DA1AF5917262F8FD3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">most recent timetable</a> shows the agency finalizing the car and truck standards in March and the power plant rules in April.
</p>
<p>
There’s a number of other ways that Biden could cement his climate legacy in the coming months. His Securities and Exchange Commission, led by Gary Gensler, has proposed climate reporting standards that would require public companies to disclose information to investors about their emissions and vulnerabilities to climate-related risks — these have yet to be finalized.
</p>
<p>
The number of programs in the Inflation Reduction Act is vast and the money is barely out the door. Patterson said Evergreen wants to see the administration getting the word out about the funding and providing technical assistance to states and communities to make sure these programs get fully taken advantage of.
</p>
<p>
It has also become increasingly clear that a transformation of the power sector is contingent on reforms to <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/permitting-reform-transmission-nepa-geothermal" target="_self">permitting processes</a> and better planning for transmission infrastructure. Biden will need <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/policy-regulation/the-us-needs-to-build-a-bigger-stronger-grid-ferc-has-a-plan-for-that" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to finalize rules</a> that require electric grid operators to incorporate clean energy policies into their planning.
</p>
<p>
At stake is not just Biden’s legacy, but the country’s commitment to the rest of the world to halve emissions by 2030 — a goal that will help prevent the most disastrous climate outcomes.
</p>
<p>
“You can see the price we’re paying,” Doniger said. “2023 was the hottest year ever, filled with climate driven disasters which killed people and cost gazillions of dollars. There’s no reason not to expect more of the same in 2024 and looking out ahead unless we finally clamp down on emissions.”

<h2 id="blinken-heads-to-middle-east-as-risk-of-broader-conflict-grows">Blinken Heads to Middle East As Risk of Broader Conflict Grows</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken heads to the Middle East late Thursday amid intense diplomatic efforts to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to the war-ravaged Gaza Strip, amid increasing international pressure on Israel to reduce civilian casualties among Palestinians.</p>
<p>Blinken’s fourth visit to the Middle East since October 7 comes as Israel’s war with Hamas militants approaches its three-month mark. Hamas has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and others.</p>
<p>“The secretary will visit Turkey, Greece, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Israel, the West Bank and Egypt for meetings with foreign counterparts and others,” U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller announced during Thursday’s briefing.</p>
<p>Blinken will discuss immediate measures to increase humanitarian assistance to Gaza, such as increasing the number of trucks allowed to enter Gaza to deliver food, water, medicine and commercial goods, according to the State Department. The chief U.S. diplomat also will pursue ongoing efforts to bring home the remaining hostages.</p>
<p>“You will see us pushing additional steps on what Gaza should look like at the end of the conflict,” Miller told reporters.</p>
<p>US making post-war roadmap</p>
<p>Israel began its military campaign to wipe out Hamas after Hamas fighters crossed into southern Israel on October 7. Israel said about 1,200 people were killed and about 240 captives taken in the terror attack. Gaza health officials say at least 22,000 Palestinians — a large percentage of them women and children — have been confirmed killed in Israel’s military offensive in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>The United States has stated its opposition to forcibly removing Palestinians from Gaza. The U.S. also is working on a post-war road map for the Palestinian territories.</p>
<p>“Gaza cannot, once again, serve as a launching pad for terrorist attacks against Israel,” State Department spokesperson Miller told VOA on Wednesday. “What we ultimately want to see is Gaza and the West Bank reunited under Palestinian leadership,” and “certainly there’s no role for Hamas in that.”</p>
<p>Israel plans more targeted strategy</p>
<p>On Thursday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant outlined the country’s plans for the next stage of its operations in Gaza. The new approach involves a more targeted strategy in northern Gaza and a continued pursuit of Hamas leaders in the south.</p>
<p>Gallant said in a statement that after the war, Gaza would no longer be under Hamas control. While Israel retains operational freedom, there won’t be any Israeli civilians present in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>Amos Hochstein, a senior adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, also will travel to Israel to work toward calming tensions between Israel and Hezbollah. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told reporters Blinken will hold meetings with Turkish officials on Saturday, according to local media.</p>
<p>Senior U.S. officials’ meetings in the Middle East come at a time when the risk of a broader regional conflict is escalating, despite the collective efforts of Western and regional powers to confine the Israel-Hamas war to the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>The State Department said the United States remains “incredibly concerned” about the risk of the conflict spreading into other fronts, after the killing Tuesday of senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut.</p>
<p>The Israeli army said it was on high alert for attacks by the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. This follows a drone strike in Beirut that killed al-Arouri, who was closely associated with Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah.</p>
<p>In a televised speech, Nasrallah said there would be a “response and punishment,” but he did not clearly declare that his forces would escalate attacks against Israel.</p>
<p>US sends ‘direct message’</p>
<p>The U.S. has sent a “very direct message to Hezbollah” and other entities in the region that “now is not the time to think of escalating further,” according to the State Department.</p>
<p>“You’ve seen us take deterrence steps to deliver that message. You’ve seen us take diplomatic steps to deliver it. We’ll continue to deliver it,” Miller, the State Department spokesperson, told reporters during a briefing on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon also has voiced concern over the potential for escalation, while urging all parties to exercise restraint.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, condemned the strike that resulted in the death of al-Arouri, calling it a crime deliberately aimed at dragging Lebanon into a new phase of confrontations.</p>
<p>Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran, whose militant allies in Syria, Iraq and Yemen also have been carrying out longer-range attacks against Israel.</p>
<p>Humanitarian aid</p>
<p>The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has warned that Gaza is becoming a public health disaster and that recent mass displacement across southern Gaza is fueling disease outbreaks.</p>
<p>More than 400,000 cases of infectious diseases have been reported since October 7, with about 180,000 people suffering from upper respiratory infections. There have also been more than 136,000 cases of diarrhea reported, half among children younger than 5, according to OCHA.</p>
<p>“Humanitarian workers need safe, sustained and unhindered access now to deliver urgently needed life-saving assistance,” OCHA said.</p>
<p>Efforts to release hostages continue</p>
<p>Meanwhile, intense diplomatic efforts to retrieve the remaining hostages held in Gaza by Hamas militants continue. There are believed to be 129 people held by Hamas and other militants in Gaza.</p>
<p>Last week, Egypt proposed a plan to end the military conflict involving a cease-fire, a phased hostage release, and the formation of a Palestinian government of experts to administer the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.</p>
<p>Details of the plan were reportedly worked out with the Persian Gulf nation of Qatar and presented to Israel, Hamas, the United States and European governments. But the head of Hamas’ political bureau, Ismail Haniyeh, stated on Tuesday that the hostages will be released only on Hamas’ terms.</p>
<p>The State Department said it’s a “top priority” for the U.S. government to bring all hostages home but declined to comment publicly on the negotiations.</p>
<p>Some material for this report came from Reuters.</p>

<h2 id="decoding-the-multifaceted-interventions-between-human-sirtuin-2-and-dynamic-hepatitis-b-viral-proteins-to-confirm-their-roles-in-hbv-replication">Decoding the multifaceted interventions between human sirtuin 2 and dynamic hepatitis B viral proteins to confirm their roles in HBV replication</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<p>
The human sirtuin 2 gene (<italic>SIRT2</italic>) encodes a full-length Sirt2 protein (i.e., the Sirt2 isoform 1), which primarily functions as a cytoplasmic α-tubulin deacetylase, and which promotes the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication itself, or HBV X (HBx) protein-mediated transcriptional transactivation, enhances Sirt2.1 expression; therefore, Sirt2.1 itself is capable of positively increasing HBV transcription and replication. Sirt2.1 is linked to liver fibrosis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and, consequently, augments the risk of HCC. The Sirt2.1 protein enhances the HBV replication cycle by activating the AKT/glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β)/β-catenin pathway. It also activates the transcription of the viral enhancer I/HBx promoter (EnI/Xp) and enhancer II/HBc promoter (EnII/Cp) by targeting the transcription factor p53. The Sirt2 isoform 2 (Sirt2.2) is mainly localized in the cytoplasm, and the N-terminus is shorter by 37 amino acids than that of Sirt2.1. Despite the truncation of the N-terminal region, Sirt2.2 is still capable of enhancing HBV replication and activating the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway. The Sirt2 isoform 5 (Sirt2.5) is primarily localized to the nucleus, it lacks a nuclear export signal (NES), and the catalytic domain (CD) is truncated. Upon HBV replication, expression of the Sirt2 isoforms is also enhanced, which further upregulates the HBV replication, and, therefore, supports the vicious cycle of viral replication and progression of the disease. Sirt2 diversely affects HBV replication such that its isoform 1 intensely augments HBV replication and isoform 2 (despite of the truncated N-terminal region) moderately enhances HBV replication. Isoform 5, on the other hand, tends to protect the cell (for smooth long-term continued viral replication) from HBV-induced extreme damage or death via a discrete set of regulatory mechanisms impeding viral mRNAs, the hepatitis B core/capsid protein (HBc), core particles, replicative intermediate (RI) DNAs, and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) levels, and, consequently, limiting HBV replication. In contrast to Sirt2.1 and Sirt 2.2, the Sirt2.5-mediated HBV replication is independent of the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling cascade. Sirt2.5 is recruited more at cccDNA than the recruitment of Sirt2.1 onto the cccDNA. This recruitment causes the deposition of more histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs), including SETDB1, SUV39H1, EZH2, and PR-Set7, along with the respective corresponding transcriptional repressive markers such as H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and H4K20me1 onto the HBV cccDNA. In HBV-replicating cells, Sirt2.5 can also make complexes with PR-Set7 and SETDB1. In addition, Sirt2.5 has the ability to turn off transcription from cccDNA through epigenetic modification via either direct or indirect interaction with HKMTs.

<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Preterm birth is a leading cause of neonatal mortality, which is often complicated by intrauterine infection and inflammation. We have established a nonhuman primate model of Group B <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (GBS, <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic>) infection-associated preterm birth. Immune checkpoints are modulators of the immune response by activating or suppressing leukocyte function and are understudied in preterm birth. The objective of this study was to spatially profile changes in immune protein expression at the maternal-fetal interface during a GBS infection with a focus on immune checkpoints.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
Twelve nonhuman primates (pigtail macaques, <italic>Macaca nemestrina</italic>) received a choriodecidual inoculation of either: 1) 1-5 X 10<sup>8</sup> colony forming units (CFU) of hyperhemolytic/hypervirulent GBS (GBSΔ<italic>covR</italic>, N=4); 2) an isogenic/nonpigmented strain (GBS Δ<italic>covR</italic>Δ<italic>cylE</italic>, N=4); or, 3) saline (N=4). A Cesarean section was performed at preterm labor or 3 days after GBS infection or 7 days after saline inoculation. Nanostring GeoMx® Digital Spatial Profiling technology was used to segment protein expression within the amnion, chorion, and maternal decidua at the inoculation site using an immuno-oncology panel targeting 56 immunoproteins enriched in stimulatory and inhibitory immune checkpoint proteins or their protein ligands. Statistical analysis included R studio, Kruskal-Wallis, Pearson and Spearman tests.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Both inhibitory and stimulatory immune checkpoint proteins were significantly upregulated within the chorioamniotic membranes and decidua (VISTA, LAG3, PD-1, CD40, GITR), as well as their ligands (PD-L1, PD-L2, CD40L; all p&lt;0.05). Immunostaining for VISTA revealed positive (VISTA+) cells, predominantly in the chorion and decidua. There were strong correlations between VISTA and amniotic fluid concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α (all p&lt;0.05), as well as maternal placental histopathology scores (p&lt;0.05).
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Differential regulation of multiple immune checkpoint proteins in the decidua at the site of a GBS infection indicates a major perturbation in immunologic homeostasis that could benefit the host by restricting immune-driven pathologies or the pathogen by limiting immune surveillance. Protein expression of VISTA, an inhibitory immune checkpoint, was upregulated in the chorion and decidua after GBS infection. Investigating the impact of innate immune cell expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints may reveal new insights into placental host-pathogen interactions at the maternal-fetal interface.

<h2 id="exploring-the-intestinal-ecosystem-from-gut-microbiota-to-associations-with-subtypes-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease">Exploring the intestinal ecosystem: from gut microbiota to associations with subtypes of inflammatory bowel disease</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Objective
</title>
<p>
Significant differences have been discovered between subtypes of Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The role of gut microbiota in promoting the onset of UC and CD is established, but conclusions regarding subtype-specific analyses remain limited.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
This study aims to explore the influence of gut microbiota on subtypes of UC and CD, offering novel insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of UC and CD.Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was employed to examine the causal relationship between subtypes of UC and CD and gut microbiota composition. Gut microbiota data were sourced from the International Consortium MiBioGen, while UC and CD data were obtained from FINNGEN. Eligible single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected as instrumental variables. Multiple analytical approaches such as inverse variance-weighted (IVW), MR-Egger regression, weighted median, weighted mode, and MR-RAPS were utilized. Sensitivity analyses including MR-Egger intercept test, Cochran’s Q test, and leave-one-out analysis were conducted for quality control. Subsequently, we employed multivariable IVW, MR-Egger, weighted median, and LASSO regression methods to identify independently significant genera or families and conducted sensitivity analyses.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
We have determined that <italic>Hungatella</italic>, <italic>Acidaminococcaceae</italic>, and 15 other microbial taxa act as protective factors for various CD and UC subtypes, while <italic>Terrisporobacter</italic>, <italic>Anaerostipes</italic>, and 23 other microbial taxa are associated with increased risk for different CD and UC subtypes. Furthermore, through multivariable MR analysis, we have identified significant genera or families with independent effects.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Our study confirms a causal relationship between dysbiosis of gut microbiota and the occurrence of CD and UC subtypes. Furthermore, it validates etiological distinctions among different subtypes of CD and UC. A novel approach to adjunctive therapy involving distinct UC or CD subtypes may involve the use of probiotics and represents a potential avenue for future treatments.

<h2 id="a-peroxidase-derived-ligand-that-induces-fusarium-graminearum-ste2-receptor-dependent-chemotropism">A peroxidase-derived ligand that induces Fusarium graminearum Ste2 receptor-dependent chemotropism</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
The fungal G protein-coupled receptors Ste2 and Ste3 are vital in mediating directional hyphal growth of the agricultural pathogen <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> towards wheat plants. This chemotropism is induced by a catalytic product of peroxidases secreted by the wheat. Currently, the identity of this product, and the substrate it is generated from, are not known.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods and results
</title>
<p>
We provide evidence that a peroxidase substrate is derived from <italic>F. graminearum</italic> conidia and report a simple method to extract and purify the <italic>Fg</italic>Ste2-activating ligand for analyses by mass spectrometry. The mass spectra arising from t he ligand extract are characteristic of a 400 Da carbohydrate moiety. Consistent with this type of molecule, glycosidase treatment of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> conidia prior to peroxidase treatment significantly reduced the amount of ligand extracted. Interestingly, availability of the peroxidase substrate appears to depend on the presence of both <italic>Fg</italic>Ste2 and <italic>Fg</italic>Ste3, as knockout of one or the other reduces the chemotropism-inducing effect of the extracts.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
While further characterization is necessary, identification of the <italic>F. graminearum</italic>-derived peroxidase substrate and the <italic>Fg</italic>Ste2-activating ligand will unearth deeper insights into the intricate mechanisms that underlie fungal pathogenesis in cereal crops, unveiling novel avenues for inhibitory interventions.

Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori, Hp) affects billions of people worldwide. However, the emerging resistance of Hp to antibiotics challenges the effectiveness of current treatments. Investigating the genotype-phenotype connection for Hp using next-generation sequencing could enhance our understanding of this resistance.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
In this study, we analyzed 52 Hp strains collected from various hospitals. The susceptibility of these strains to five antibiotics was assessed using the agar dilution assay. Whole-genome sequencing was then performed to screen the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genotypes of these Hp strains. To model the relationship between drug resistance and genotype, we employed univariate statistical tests, unsupervised machine learning, and supervised machine learning techniques, including the development of support vector machine models.

<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Our models for predicting Amoxicillin resistance demonstrated 66% sensitivity and 100% specificity, while those for Clarithromycin resistance showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. These results outperformed the known resistance sites for Amoxicillin (A1834G) and Clarithromycin (A2147), which had sensitivities of 22.2% and 87%, and specificities of 100% and 96%, respectively.

<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
Our study demonstrates that predictive modeling using supervised learning algorithms with feature selection can yield diagnostic models with higher predictive power compared to models relying on single single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites. This approach significantly contributes to enhancing the precision and effectiveness of antibiotic treatment strategies for Hp infections. The application of whole-genome sequencing for Hp presents a promising pathway for advancing personalized medicine in this context.

<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Evidence supports an observational association between the gut microbiome and susceptibility to extraintestinal cancers, but the causal relationship of this association remains unclear.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
To identify the specific causal gut microbiota of oral and oropharyngeal cancer, we performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis of gut microbiota on oral and oropharyngeal cancer using a fixed-effects inverse-variance-weighted model. Gut microbiota across five different taxonomical levels from the MiBioGen genome-wide association study (GWAS) were used as exposures. Oral cancer, oropharyngeal cancer and a combination of the two cancers defined from three separate data sources were used as the outcomes. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for disease per standard deviation (SD) higher abundance of microbiome.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results &amp; Conclusions
</title>
<p>
There was little evidence for a causal effect of gut microbiota on oral and oropharyngeal cancer when using a genome-wide p-value threshold for selecting instruments. Secondary analyses using a more lenient p-value threshold indicated that there were 90 causal relationships between 58 different microbial features but that sensitivity analyses suggested that these were possibly affected by violations of MR assumptions and were not consistent across MR methodologies or data sources and therefore are also to unlikely reflect causation. These findings provide new insights into gut microbiota-mediated oral and oropharyngeal cancers and warrant further investigation.

<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between gut microbiota and high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR) in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We enrolled a total of 48 AIS patients, including 19 HTPR patients and 29 non-high on-treatment platelet reactivity (NHTPR) patients, along with 10 healthy controls. Clinical and laboratory data, as well as stool samples, were collected from all participants. The composition and function of gut microbiota were assessed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Differences in the gut microbiota between the two groups were analyzed, and a diagnostic model based on the gut microbiota was established using random forest model.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
HTPR patients exhibited a decreased microbial richness compared to NHTPR patients. Additionally, the relative abundance of <italic>unidentified_Clostridia</italic> and <italic>Ralstonia</italic> was lower in HTPR patients. Significant differences in biological functions, such as toxoplasmosis, were observed between the two groups. The combination of <italic>Ralstonia, unidentified-Clostridia, Mailhella, Anaerofustis</italic>, and <italic>Aggregatibacter</italic> showed excellent predictive ability for HTPR occurrence (AUC=0.896). When comparing AIS patients with healthy controls, alterations in the microbiota structure were observed in AIS patients, with imbalances in short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria and pathogenic bacteria. Significant differences in biological functions, such as oxidative phosphorylation, were noted between the two groups. The combination of <italic>Alloprevotella, Terrisporobacter, Streptococcus, Proteus</italic>, and <italic>unidentified_Bacteria</italic> exhibited strong predictive power for AIS occurrence (AUC=0.994).
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
This study is the first to uncover the microbial characteristics of HTPR in AIS patients and demonstrate the predictive potential of specific bacterial combinations for HTPR occurrence.

<h2 id="regulatory-role-of-mss11-in-candida-glabrata-virulence-adhesion-and-biofilm-formation">Regulatory role of Mss11 in Candida glabrata virulence: adhesion and biofilm formation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
<italic>Candida glabrata</italic> has emerged as a fungal pathogen with high infection and mortality rates, and its primary virulence factors are related to adhesion and biofilm formation. These virulence factors in <italic>C.glabrata</italic> are primarily mediated by epithelial adhesins (Epas), most of which are encoded in subtelomeric regions and regulated by subtelomeric silencing mechanisms. The transcription factor Mss11, known for its regulatory role in adhesion, biofilm formation, and filamentous growth in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, has also been implicated in the expression of <italic>EPA6</italic>, suggesting its potential influence on <italic>C.glabrata</italic> virulence. The present study aims to determine the regulatory role of Mss11 in the virulence of <italic>C. glabrata</italic>.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
In this work, a <italic>Δmss11</italic> null mutant and its complemented strain were constructed from a <italic>C.glabrata</italic> standard strain. The impact of the transcription factor Mss11 on the virulence of <italic>C.glabrata</italic> was investigated through a series of phenotypic experiments, including the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons (MATH) test, adherence assay, biofilm assay, scanning electron microscopy and <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> virulence assay. Furthermore, transcriptome sequencing, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) were employed to investigate the molecular mechanisms behind the regulation of Mss11.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
In <italic>C.glabrata</italic>, the loss of <italic>MSS11</italic> led to a significant reduction in several virulence factors including cell surface hydrophobicity, epithelial cell adhesion, and biofilm formation. These observations were consistent with the decreased virulence of the <italic>Δmss11</italic> mutant observed in the <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> infection model. Further exploration demonstrated that Mss11 modulates <italic>C. glabrata</italic> virulence by regulating <italic>EPA1</italic> and <italic>EPA6</italic> expression. It binds to the upstream regions of <italic>EPA1</italic> and <italic>EPA6</italic>, as well as the promoter regions of the subtelomeric silencing-related genes <italic>SIR4</italic>, <italic>RIF1</italic>, and <italic>RAP1</italic>, indicating the dual regulatory role of Mss11.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Mss11 plays a crucial role in <italic>C. glabrata</italic> adhesion and biofilm formation, and thus has a broad influence on virulence. This regulation is achieved by regulating the expression of <italic>EPA1</italic> and <italic>EPA6</italic> through both promoter-specific regulation and subtelomeric silencing.

<h2 id="comprehensive-evaluation-of-plasma-microbial-cell-free-dna-sequencing-for-predicting-bloodstream-and-local-infections-in-clinical-practice-a-multicenter-retrospective-study">Comprehensive evaluation of plasma microbial cell-free DNA sequencing for predicting bloodstream and local infections in clinical practice: a multicenter retrospective study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) shows promising application for complicated infections that cannot be resolved by conventional microbiological tests (CMTs). The criteria for cfDNA sequencing are currently in need of agreement and standardization.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We performed a retrospective cohort observation of 653 patients who underwent plasma cfDNA mNGS, including 431 with suspected bloodstream infections (BSI) and 222 with other suspected systemic infections. Plasma mNGS and CMTs were performed simultaneously in clinical practice. The diagnostic efficacy of plasma mNGS and CMTs in the diagnosis of blood-borne and other systemic infections was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The sensitivity and specificity of the two methods were analyzed based on the final clinical outcome as the gold standard.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The mNGS test showed an overall positive rate of 72.3% (472/653) for detecting microorganisms in plasma cfDNA, with a range of 2 to 6 different microorganisms detected in 171 patient specimens. Patients with positive mNGS results were more immunocompromised and had a higher incidence of severe disease (P&lt;0·05). The sensitivity of mNGS was higher for BSI (93·5%) and other systemic infections (83·6%) compared to CMTs (37·7% and 14·3%, respectively). The mNGS detected DNA from a total of 735 microorganisms, with the number of microbial DNA reads ranging from 3 to 57,969, and a higher number of reads being associated with clinical infections (P&lt;0·05). Of the 472 patients with positive mNGS results, clinical management was positively affected in 203 (43%) cases. Negative mNGS results led to a modified clinical management regimen in 92 patients (14.1%). The study also developed a bacterial and fungal library for plasma mNGS and obtained comparisons of turnaround times and detailed processing procedures for rare pathogens.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Our study evaluates the clinical use and analytic approaches of mNGS in predicting bloodstream and local infections in clinical practice. Our results suggest that mNGS has higher positive predictive values (PPVs) for BSI and systemic infections compared to CMTs, and can positively affect clinical management in a significant number of patients. The standardized whole-process management procedure for plasma mNGS developed in this study will ensure improved pre-screening probabilities and yield clinically valuable data.

<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<p>
<italic>Aspergillus terreus</italic> is a fungus responsible for various infections in human beings; however, spine involvement is uncommon. Herein, we report a case of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>terreus</italic> spondylodiscitis following acupuncture and acupotomy in an immunocompetent Chinese patient. Admission lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed infection at the L4/5 level without significant vertebral destruction. After unsuccessful symptomatic and anti-tuberculosis treatments, <italic>A. terreus</italic> was identified through culture, microscopy of isolate, histological examination and VITEK system. Intravenous voriconazole was then given; however, the patient’s spinal condition deteriorated rapidly, resulting in evident destruction of the L4/5 vertebral bodies. Surgeries including L4/5 intervertebral disc debridement, spinal canal decompression, posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) with allogeneic fibula ring fusion cages, and posterior pedicle screw fixation were then performed. Imaging findings at one-month and six-month follow-up suggested that the patient was successfully treated. This case highlighted two important points: firstly, although acupuncture and acupotomy are generally regarded as safe conservative treatments for pain management, they can still lead to complications such as fungal spinal infection. Therefore, vigilance is necessary when considering these treatments; secondly, PLIF with allogeneic fibula ring fusion cages may be beneficial for <italic>A. terreus</italic> spondylodiscitis patients with spinal instability.

<p>date: 2024-01-04, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<p>
Recent reports have shown that wild crabs may be important hosts involved in the transmission and spread of the parasitic <italic>Hematodinium</italic> in cultured marine crustaceans. Therefore, monitoring the prevalence of <italic>Hematodinium</italic> infections in wild crabs is necessary to develop effective strategies for the prevention and control of <italic>Hematodinium</italic> disease. Here we report a wild crab species, <italic>Macrophthalmus</italic> (<italic>Macrophthalmus</italic>) <italic>abbreviatus</italic> Manning &amp; Holthuis, 1981, as a new natural host for <italic>Hematodinium</italic> sp. infection. It is one of the common wild crab species dwelling in the ponds or waterways connected to the polyculture ponds located on the coast of Rizhao or Weifang, Shandong Peninsula, China. According to the results of PCR detection and phylogenetic analysis targeting the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS 1) region, these <italic>Hematodinium</italic> sp. isolates were identified as <italic>H. perezi</italic> and fell into the genotype II category within <italic>H. perezi</italic>. A high monthly prevalence of <italic>H. perezi</italic> infection was observed during the 2021–2022 field survey, ranging from 33.3% to 90.6% in <italic>M. abbreviatus</italic> originating from Weifang (n=304 wild crabs) and from 53.6% to 92.9% in those from Rizhao (n=42 wild crabs). Artificial inoculation infection experiments demonstrated that <italic>M. abbreviatus</italic> could be infected by <italic>H. perezi</italic>, and massive <italic>Hematodinium</italic> cells and typical histopathological changes were observed in the hepatopancreas and gill tissues of the infected crabs. To our knowledge, this is the first report of <italic>M. abbreviatus</italic> as a new natural host for <italic>H. perezi</italic> infection. Results in the present study extend the known host spectrum for this emerging parasite pathogen, and also provide valuable information for epidemic surveillance of the <italic>Hematodinium</italic> disease as well.

While on a run this week, I was listening to an old Oxide and Friends episode where Bryan, Adam, and crew were reminiscing on the SPARC instruction set architecture (ISA). SPARC is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture originally developed by Sun Microsystems, with the first machine, the SPARCstation1 (a.k.a. Sun 4/60, a.k.a Campus), being delivered in 1987. It was heavily influenced by the early RISC designs from David Patterson and team at Berkeley in the 1970s and 1980s, which is the same lineage from which RISC-V has evolved. Given the decision to base moss on the RISC-V RV64I ISA, I was interested to learn more about the history and finer details of SPARC. ↫ Daniel Mangum The sad thing is that SPARC is pretty close to dead at this point, with the two major players in the high-end – Oracle and Fujitsu – throwing in the towel half a decade ago. There’s some lower-end work, such as the LEON chips, but those efforts, too, seem to be going nowhere at the moment. Definitely sad, since I’ve always been oddly obsessed with the architecture, and hope to still somehow get my hands on the last UltraSPARC workstation ever built (the Sun Ultra 45, which is, sadly, incredibly expensive on the used market). There’s also a whole boatload of servers on the used market with fancier, newer SPARC processors, but as far as I know, none of those support any form of even barely usable graphics, making them useless for weird people like me who want to run a desktop on them.</p>

<h2 id="alzheimers-drugs-might-get-into-the-brain-faster-with-new-ultrasound-tool">Alzheimer’s Drugs Might Get Into the Brain Faster With New Ultrasound Tool</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Scientists have found a way to help Alzheimer’s drugs seep inside the brain faster — by temporarily breaching its protective shield.</p>
<p>The novel experiment was a first attempt in just three patients. But in spots in the brain where the new technology took aim, it enhanced removal of Alzheimer’s trademark brain-clogging plaque, researchers reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to give patients a head start,” by boosting some new Alzheimer’s treatments that take a long time to work, said Dr. Ali Rezai of West Virginia University’s Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute, who led the study.</p>
<p>At issue is what’s called the blood-brain barrier, a protective lining in blood vessels that prevents germs and other damaging substances from leaching into the brain from the bloodstream. But it also can block drugs for Alzheimer’s, tumors and other neurologic diseases, requiring higher doses for longer periods for enough to reach their target inside the brain.</p>
<p>Now scientists are using a technology called focused ultrasound to jiggle temporary openings in that shield. They inject microscopic bubbles into the bloodstream. Next, they beam sound waves through a helmetlike device to a precise brain area. The pulses of energy vibrate the microbubbles, which loosen gaps in the barrier enough for medications to slip in.</p>
<p>Prior small studies have found the technology can safely poke tiny holes that seal up in 48 hours. Now Rezai’s team has gone a step further — administering an Alzheimer’s drug at the same time.</p>
<p>Some new Alzheimer’s drugs, on the market or in the pipeline, promise to modestly slow worsening of the mind-robbing disease. They’re designed to clear away a sticky protein called beta-amyloid that builds up in certain brain regions. But they require IV infusions every few weeks for at least 18 months.</p>
<p>“Why not try to clear the plaques within a few months?” Rezai said, his rationale for the proof-of-concept study.</p>
<p>3 patients, 1 drug, 6 months</p>
<p>His team gave three patients with mild Alzheimer’s monthly doses of one such drug, Aduhelm, for six months. Right after each IV, researchers aimed the focused ultrasound on a specific amyloid-clogged part of each patient’s brain, opening the blood brain-barrier so more of that day’s dose might enter that spot.</p>
<p>PET scans show patients’ amyloid levels before and after the six months of medication. There was about 32% greater plaque reduction in spots where the blood-brain barrier was breached compared to the same region on the brain’s opposite side, researchers reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p>This pilot study is elegant but too tiny to draw any conclusions, cautioned Dr. Eliezer Masliah of the National Institute on Aging.</p>
<p>Still, “it’s very exciting, compelling data,” added Masliah, who wasn’t involved with the research. “It opens the door for more extensive, larger studies, definitely.”</p>
<p>More testing on horizon</p>
<p>Rezai is about to begin another small test of a similar but better proven drug named Leqembi. Eventually, large studies would be needed to tell if combining focused ultrasound with Alzheimer’s drugs makes a real difference for patients.</p>
<p>Masliah said it’s also important to closely check whether speedier plaque reduction might increase the risk of a rare but worrisome side effect of these new drugs — bleeding and swelling in the brain.</p>
<p>Alzheimer’s isn’t the only target. Other researchers are testing if breaching the blood-brain barrier could allow more chemotherapy to reach brain tumors, and ways to target other diseases.</p>

<h2 id="trump-asks-us-supreme-court-to-review-colorado-ruling-barring-him-from-ballot-over-jan.-6-attack">Trump Asks US Supreme Court to Review Colorado Ruling Barring Him From Ballot Over Jan. 6 Attack</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Denver, Colorado — Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a ruling barring him from the Colorado ballot, setting up a high-stakes showdown over whether a constitutional provision prohibiting those who “engaged in insurrection” will end his political career.</p>
<p>Trump appealed a 4-3 ruling in December by the Colorado Supreme Court that marked the first time in history that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment was used to bar a presidential contender from the ballot. The court found that Trump’s role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol disqualified him under the clause.</p>
<p>The provision has been used so sparingly in American history that the U.S. Supreme Court has never ruled on it.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s development came a day after Trump’s legal team filed an appeal against a ruling by Maine’s Democratic Secretary of State, Shenna Bellows, that Trump was ineligible to appear on that state’s ballot over his role in the Capitol attack. Both the Colorado Supreme Court and the Maine secretary of state’s rulings are on hold until the appeals play out.</p>
<p>Trump’s critics have filed dozens of lawsuits seeking to disqualify him in multiple states. He lost Colorado by 13 percentage points in 2020 and does not need to win the state to gain either the Republican presidential nomination or the presidency. But the Colorado ruling has the potential to prompt courts or secretaries of state to remove him from the ballot in other, must-win states.</p>
<p>None had succeeded until a slim majority of Colorado’s seven justices — all appointed by Democratic governors — ruled last month against Trump. Critics warned that it was an overreach and that the court could not simply declare that the Jan. 6 attack was an “insurrection” without a judicial process.</p>
<p>“The Colorado Supreme Court decision would unconstitutionally disenfranchise millions of voters in Colorado and likely be used as a template to disenfranchise tens of millions of voters nationwide,” Trump’s lawyers wrote in their appeal to the nation’s highest court, noting that Maine has already followed Colorado’s lead.</p>
<p>Trump’s new appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court also follows one from Colorado’s Republican Party. Legal observers expect the high court will take the case because it concerns unsettled constitutional issues that go to the heart of the way the country is governed.</p>
<p>All the parties to the case have urged the court to move quickly. Trump’s lawyers on Wednesday asked the court to overturn the ruling without even hearing oral arguments. The lawyers representing the Colorado plaintiffs have urged oral arguments but also seek a vastly accelerated schedule, calling for a resolution by next month. Colorado’s primary is March 5.</p>
<p>Sean Grimsley, an attorney for the plaintiffs seeking to disqualify Trump in Colorado, said late last month on a legal podcast called “Law, disrupted” that he hopes the nation’s highest court hurries once it accepts the case, as he expects it will.</p>
<p>“We have a primary coming up on Super Tuesday and we need to know the answer,” Grimsley said.</p>
<p>The Colorado high court upheld a finding by a district court judge that Jan. 6 was an “insurrection” incited by Trump. It agreed with the petitioners, six Republican and unaffiliated Colorado voters whose lawsuit was funded by a Washington-based liberal group, that Trump clearly violated the provision. Because of that, the court ruled he is disqualified just as plainly as if he failed to meet the Constitution’s minimum age requirement for the presidency of 35 years.</p>
<p>In doing so, the state high court reversed a ruling by the lower court judge that said it wasn’t clear that Section 3 was meant to apply to the president. That’s one of many issues the nation’s highest court would consider.</p>
<p>Additional ones include whether states such as Colorado can determine who is covered by Section 3, whether congressional action is needed to create a process to bar people from office, whether Jan. 6 met the legal definition of insurrection and whether Trump was simply engaging in First Amendment activity that day or is responsible for the violent attack, which was intended to halt certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s victory.</p>
<p>Trump held a rally before the Capitol attack, telling his supporters that “if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”</p>
<p>Six of the U.S. Supreme Court’s nine justices were appointed by Republicans, and three by Trump himself.</p>
<p>The Colorado ruling cited a prior decision by Neil Gorsuch, one of Trump’s appointees to the high court, when he was a federal judge in Colorado. That ruling determined that the state had a legitimate interest in removing from the presidential ballot a naturalized U.S. citizen who was ineligible for the office because he was born in Guyana.</p>
<p>Section 3, however, has barely been used since the years after the Civil War, when it kept defeated Confederates from returning to their former government positions. The two-sentence clause says that anyone who swore an oath to “support” the Constitution and then engaged in insurrection cannot hold office unless a two-thirds vote of Congress allows it.</p>
<p>Legal scholars believe its only application in the 20th century was being cited by Congress in 1919 to block the seating of a socialist who opposed U.S. involvement in World War I and was elected to the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>But in 2022, a judge used it to remove a rural New Mexico county commissioner from office after he was convicted of a misdemeanor for entering the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Liberal groups sued to block Republican Reps. Madison Cawthorn and Marjorie Taylor Greene from running for reelection because of their roles on that day. Cawthorn’s case became moot when he lost his primary in 2022, and a judge ruled to keep Greene on the ballot.</p>
<p>Some conservatives warn that, if Trump is removed, political groups will routinely use Section 3 against opponents in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Biden’s administration has noted that the president has no role in the litigation.</p>
<p>The issue of whether Trump can be on the ballot is not the only matter related to the former president or Jan. 6 that has reached the high court. The justices last month declined a request from special counsel Jack Smith to swiftly take up and rule on Trump’s claims that he is immune from prosecution in a case charging him with plotting to overturn the presidential election, though the issue could be back before the court soon depending on the ruling of a Washington-based appeals court.</p>
<p>And the court has said that it intends to hear an appeal that could upend hundreds of charges stemming from the Capitol riot, including against Trump.</p>

<h2 id="house-republicans-visit-us-mexico-border-as-ukraine-aid-hangs-in-balance">House Republicans Visit US-Mexico Border as Ukraine Aid Hangs in Balance</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>EAGLE PASS, Texas — U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson is leading about 60 fellow Republicans in Congress on a visit Wednesday to the Mexican border as they demand hard-line immigration policies in exchange for backing President Joe Biden’s emergency wartime funding request for Ukraine. The trip to Eagle Pass, Texas, comes as Senate negotiators keep plugging away in hopes of a bipartisan deal.</p>
<p>With the number of illegal crossings into the United States topping 10,000 on several days last month, the border city has been at the center of Republican Governor Greg Abbott’s Operation Lone Star, his nearly $10 billion initiative that has tested the federal government’s authority over immigration and elevated the political fight over the issue.</p>
<p>An agreement in the lengthy talks in Washington would unlock Republican support for Biden’s $110 billion package for Ukraine, Israel and other U.S. security priorities. In meetings, Senators Kyrsten Sinema, an Independent from Arizona, James Lankford, a Republican from Oklahoma, and Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, are trying to make progress before Congress returns to Washington next week.</p>
<p>It is not known whether Johnson, who has called for “transformational” changes to border and immigration policies, would accept a bipartisan deal from the Senate. Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, has pointed to a House bill, passed in May without a single Democratic vote, that would build more of the border wall and impose new restrictions on asylum seekers. Democrats said the legislation was “cruel” and “anti-immigrant,” and Biden promised a veto.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the president has expressed a willingness to make policy compromises as the historic number of migrants crossing the border is an increasing challenge for his 2024 reelection campaign. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and White House staff have been involved in the Senate negotiations.</p>
<p>“We’ve got to do something,” Biden told reporters Tuesday night. He said Congress should approve his national security proposal because it also includes money for managing the influx of migrants. “They ought to give me the money I need to protect the border,” he said.</p>
<p>Administration officials have criticized Johnson’s trip as a political ploy that will do little to solve the problem.</p>
<p>“When they’re at the border, they’re going to see the magnitude of the problem and why we have said now for about three decades, their broken immigration system is in desperate need of legislative reform,” Mayorkas told CNN on Wednesday. “So, we are focused on the solutions, and we hope that they will return to Washington and focus on the solutions as well.”</p>
<p>House Republicans contend that Mayorkas’ management of the border has amounted to a dereliction of his duties and they are moving ahead with rare impeachment proceedings against a Cabinet member, with a first committee hearing on the matter scheduled for next week. Mayorkas told MSNBC he would cooperate with an inquiry.</p>
<p>During parts of December, border crossings in Eagle Pass, as well as other locations, swamped the resources of Customs and Border Protection officials. Authorities closed cargo rail crossings in Eagle Pass and El Paso for five days and shut down border crossings in the Arizona city of Lukeville.</p>
<p>Authorities say the numbers of migrants eased over the December holidays as part of a seasonal pattern. The border crossings are reopening, and illegal crossings in Eagle Pass fell to 500 on Monday, according to administration officials who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Along the entire border, arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico fell to about 2,500 on Monday, from more than 10,000 on several days in December, officials said.</p>
<p>Republicans, who see the high number of migrants arriving at the border as a political weakness for the president, are pressuring Biden and Democrats to accept strict border measures.</p>
<p>Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell told reporters in Kentucky on Tuesday that in a conversation with 81-year-old Biden, he made the case: “You can’t do anything about how old you are, you can’t do anything about inflation, but this is something that’s measurable that you could claim credit for.”</p>
<p>McConnell also said he was approaching the talks with “optimism that somehow we will get this all together and we’re giving it our best shot.”</p>
<p>Senate negotiators have focused on tougher asylum protocols for migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border, bolstering border enforcement with more personnel and high-tech systems, and enforcement measures that would kick in if the number of daily crossings passed a certain threshold.</p>
<p>Murphy, the chief Democratic negotiator, said Tuesday that he hoped that “at some point, Republicans can take the offer that we’ve all been working on together in the room for a long time.”</p>
<p>He raised concern that the longer the talks draw out, the longer it leaves Ukraine’s defenses hanging without assured support from the U.S. in the war with Russia.</p>
<p>The Pentagon in late December announced what officials say could be the final package of military aid for Ukraine if Congress does not approve Biden’s funding request. The weapons, worth up to $250 million, include air munitions and other missiles, artillery, anti-armor systems, ammunition, demolition and medical equipment and parts.</p>
<p>Russia has unleashed a flurry of missile and drone strikes on Ukraine in the new year.</p>
<p>“The consequence of Republicans’ decision to tie Ukraine funding to border is that the Ukrainians are already at a moment of real crisis,” Murphy said.</p>

<h2 id="us-renews-protection-for-former-secretary-of-state-aide-over-iran-threats">US Renews Protection for Former Secretary of State, Aide Over Iran Threats</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Biden administration has once again renewed taxpayer-funded protection for former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and one of his top aides, who have been the targets of persistent threats from Iran. </p>
<p>The State Department notified Congress late last month that the threats against Pompeo and Trump administration Iran envoy Brian Hook remain “serious and credible” and continue to warrant government-provided security details. </p>
<p>The notifications are dated December 19 but were not transmitted to Congress until December 22. They were obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday. </p>
<p>Tensions in the Middle East have soared since the outbreak of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza and escalated further Wednesday after dozens of people were killed in blasts in Iran at a memorial service for Iran Revolutionary Guard commander Qassem Soleimani, who was assassinated in a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad on January 3, 2020. </p>
<p>Pompeo and Hook were the public faces of the U.S. “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran after former President Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018. Iran has blamed both for the killing of Soleimani. </p>
<p>The notifications to Congress, signed by Deputy Secretary of State for Management Richard Verma, marked the 16th time the State Department has extended protection to Hook since he left office in January 2021 and the 13th time it has been extended to Pompeo. </p>
<p>The discrepancy arises because Pompeo, as a former Cabinet secretary, automatically had government security for several months after leaving office. </p>
<p>The AP reported in March 2022 that the State Department was paying more than $2 million per month to provide 24-hour security to Pompeo and Hook. The latest determinations do not give a dollar amount for the protection. </p>
<p>The notifications do not specifically identify Iran as the source of the threats, but Iranian officials have long vented anger at Pompeo and Hook for leading the Trump administration’s policy against Iran, including designating the Revolutionary Guard Corps a “foreign terrorist organization,” subjecting it to unprecedented sanctions and orchestrating the Soleimani assassination.</p>

The format isn’t all that important, see the <a href="https://this.how/standards/">rules for standards-makers</a>, what matters is the interop it delivers. The RSS 0.91 to 2.0 thread was what the market built around, because it was promoted to the market and <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#roadmap">held steady</a> for it. The other thread got bogged down in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">academic theory</a> of how the web should evolve. Content syndication was a real application. That’s the story, imho. There was no mention of the NYT in the Wikipedia piece, or Salon, Red Herring, Wired and Motley Fool. Or NPR in re podcasting, yet without the support of these news orgs, and of blogging software, there never would have been an RSS.</p>

<li>
You can fit full 4’ x 8’ plywood sheets in the back (assuming you fold down/remove the seats)

You can fit up to 12’ long dimensional lumber (1x2, 2x4, etc.) inside (passing it through the gap between front seats)

<li>
You can seat 7 or even <em>8</em> people inside, somewhat comfortably, with at least 2-3 cupholders per person (still preserving 20-30 ft<sup>3</sup> ((0.8m<sup>3</sup>) of storage space in the back!)
</li>

You can fit a full 42" deep 42U datacenter rack in the back, with space left over for one or two 2U 1500VA UPSes

<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Economic forecasts for the coming year are decently optimistic, painting a picture of fairly low unemployment, gradually slowing inflation and continued economic growth. But there are still risks to this mostly sunny outlook — some that are global and some coming from D.C. Plus, soft landing or not, the Richmond Fed president advises us to buckle up. Oh, and Happy Dry January!

That blurring has allowed new and innovative voices into the news ecosystem, but it has also made news…</p>

<p>
<strong></strong>Tesla and Rivian yesterday reported their production and sales figures for the final three months of 2023: Tesla delivered 484,507, besting expectations. Rivian, a newcomer still trying to secure itself a foothold in the market, delivered 13,972 cars over the same time period, missing estimates by a hair. “The two companies’ numbers serve as snapshots of both the promise and peril of auto electrification as we roll into 2024,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=99e79b1eee&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writes</a> Matthew Zeitlin at <em>Heatmap</em>. Tesla, having been overtaken by BYD in the global EV market, must now focus on scaling beyond the early EV adopters. Rivian, however, is at a very different stage, Zeitlin says: “not the early days of using investor money to develop a new vehicle, but the next stage, where you have an actual car to sell but you have to figure out a way to make money doing it.”

The Vineyard Wind 1 project is situated about 15 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard and will eventually consist of 62 turbines that can power more than 400,000 homes and businesses in Massachusetts. Its first five turbines have been installed, and things were looking good for a December 31 launch. But at the very last minute a <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=2dc5969802&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spokesperson said</a> the project needed more testing. No timeline was given but the spokesperson said the goal was to “deliver power to shore soon.” The project was supposed to be fully operational by the middle of 2024 but developers have now “clarified” that the timeline is sometime within 2024. In December, the South Fork Wind project in New York <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=1cde7ac242&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">became</a> the first utility-scale offshore wind farm to generate power in the U.S.

<li>U.K. fossil fuel electricity generation drops to 66-year low

<p>
<strong></strong>The amount of the United Kingdom’s electricity that came from fossil fuels dropped by 22% last year to the lowest level since 1957, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=95354efb78&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> <em>CarbonBrief</em>. Electricity from coal, oil, and gas peaked in 2008 but has since plummeted thanks to the rapid expansion of renewables like wind and solar, a drop in electricity demand, and a boost in electricity imports. Coal use is down 97% since 2008; gas is down by 45%. Meanwhile, renewables output has increased six-fold, and last year renewable energy was the UK’s single largest source of power. “Overall, the electricity generated in the UK in 2023 had the lowest-ever carbon intensity,” <em>CarbonBrief</em> concludes. <br/><br/>On the flip side, UK power generation from nuclear plants dropped to a 42-year low last year as old stations were decommissioned. Without more nuclear power to fall back on during cloudy or wind-free days, the country may have to rely more on fossil fuels, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=a191352683&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explains</a> <em>Bloomberg</em>.

<li>Wyoming carbon removal project would rely on small modular nuclear reactors

<strong></strong>A major carbon removal project planned for Wyoming would rely on small modular nuclear reactors – a new kind of nuclear power plant that has never been built in the U.S. – prompting concerns about its feasibility, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=24b14b79f2&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a><em> E&amp;E News</em>. Climate tech startup CarbonCapture recently received more than $10 million from the Department of Energy to explore plans for a direct air capture hub in Wyoming, dubbed “Project Bison.” Scientists say removing carbon from the air is necessary to help fight global warming. Small modular reactors could, in theory, provide carbon capture facilities with emissions-free power, but the nation’s first small modular reactors <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=4fa9f88f00&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were axed last year</a> as costs spiraled out of control. “It adds complication upon complication,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=26963a884b&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says</a> Wil Burns, co-director of American University’s Institute for Carbon Removal Law and Policy. “You’re starting off with a complex new technology, and now you’re trying to wed another complex technology, including one that’s in transition.”

<li>Study: Major East Coast cities are sinking

The team analyzed satellite data to spot land subsidence and found that some areas are sinking by as much as 5 millimeters per year. This subsidence, when combined with sea level rise caused by climate change, means essential structures like roads to airports are at risk in many major U.S. cities. “The problem is that the hotspots of sinking land intersect directly with population and infrastructure hubs,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=a7446a3559&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says</a> lead author Leonard Ohenhen.

<h2 id="the-michael-pollan-rule-applies-to-fashion-too">The Michael Pollan Rule Applies to Fashion, Too</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDg2ODcxOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMTU3NzUxNH0.t4kM3WfHp30rfAUO_NHoGxw-EYS7DH4lJOKQoTuX16Y/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
News broke in early November that the U.S. federal dietary guidelines <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/11/07/dietary-guidelines-ultraprocessed-foods/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">might soon warn</a> Americans against eating “ultraprocessed food.”
</p>
<p>
It’s far from a done deal — an advisory committee is merely examining the issue, with no action expected before 2025. But it’s still somewhat of a <em>duh</em> moment for the millions of people who, over the past two decades, have turned away from food that comes in instant packets, boxes, and cans, and toward things that come from the produce aisle or the farmers market. Recent research <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/07/ultraprocessed-foods-parenting-health.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">makes a strong case that</a> — more than individual villains like sugar, corn syrup, trans fats, and salt — it’s the way all these ingredients and more are pounded, mixed, extruded, and stuffed into shelf-stable forms that lead to health problems and weight gain.
</p>
<p>
Michael Pollan — the author who brought you the mantra “Eat real food, not too much, mostly plants” — is arguably one of the biggest catalysts for the real food movement. In a <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/classes/michael-pollan-teaches-intentional-eating/chapters/eat-food" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lesson from his Masterclass on intentional eating</a>, he warns against foods with “very long ingredient lists,” saying that “the simplest way to think about an ultraprocessed food is you can’t imagine making it at home.”
</p>
<p>
You’ve heard of fast food and its linguistic child: the <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/environmental-costs-fast-fashion" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">environmental scourge</a> that is fast fashion. I would like to add a new term to the health and environmental zeitgeist:
</p>
<p>
Ultraprocessed fashion.
</p>
<h3>
Corn Syrup versus Gore-Tex
</h3>
<p>
In the early 2010s, I saw my own health and happiness vastly improve after overhauling my diet to eat whole, farm-fresh foods. But I wanted to take it further. I figured that if it matters to the environment and our health where we buy our food from, it might matter where we get other things, like beauty products, home goods, and fashion.
</p>
<p>
Still, for a long, the argument for U.S. shoppers in favor of buying more sustainable fashion — the kind of classic, durable pieces skillfully made of natural fibers by artisans and American factories — was largely an altruistic one. Sustainable fashion purchases were meant to benefit a cotton farmer in India you would never meet, to protect a river in Kenya you would never see, or support a community of craftspeople in Thailand you would never have the privilege of knowing.
</p>
<p>
Even more nebulous, arguments that purchasing <em>this</em> instead of <em>that </em>would prevent the release of (super rough estimate) a few pounds of invisible climate-polluting gas into the atmosphere have not proven to be a very strong motivator for shoppers. In survey after survey, consumers <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/opinions/sustainability/sustainability-surveys-fashion-consumers-black-friday/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">swear up and down</a> that they care deeply about sustainability … as long as it doesn’t inconvenience them, cost more money, or look too crunchy.
</p>
<p>
That’s an impossible standard. Sustainable fashion, whether it takes the form of a 100% wool sweater from California, a hand-block-printed cotton sundress, or a naturally dyed button-down, is always going to be more expensive than its synthetic counterpart made in a sweatshop somewhere where the workers are cheap and the laws are loose. Neither does slow fashion keep up with TikTok trends, by definition.
</p>
<p>
I initially had a hard time connecting sustainable fashion to Western shoppers’ well-being beyond the argument that an overstuffed, chaotic closet full of fast fashion can’t be good for your mental health or time management. After all, we’re not eating our clothing, right?
</p>
<p>
That all changed in 2019, when I first heard that Delta Air Lines attendants were <a href="https://deltaafa.org/news/toxic-uniform-lands-end-class-action-lawsuit" target="_blank">suing</a> Lands’ End, the maker of their uniforms, saying the new clothes were making them sick.
</p>
<p>
If you could call any clothing ultraprocessed, it would be these uniforms. While old airline outfits were made of traditional wool suiting and cotton button-downs in staid colors, the uniforms introduced in the past decade or so at <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4982-4" target="_blank">Alaska Airlines</a>, <a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/airlines-airports/american-airlines/american-airlines-new-uniforms-lawsuit" target="_blank">American Airlines</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/7/16/20686075/flight-attendants-uniform-sick-delta-alaska-twin-hill-lands-end" target="_blank">Delta</a>, and <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/southwest-air-toxic-uniform-class-claims-advance-against-cintas" target="_blank">Southwest</a> all were made of synthetic blends. They came in super-saturated colors and were coated in layers of performance chemicals: flame retardants, Teflon for stain resistance, and formaldehyde-based wrinkle-free finishes. They were made fast and cheap by suppliers in countries with lax environmental standards.
</p>
<p>
As I reported in my book <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/705645/to-dye-for-by-alden-wicker/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>To Dye For: How Toxic Fashion Is Making Us Sick – and How We Can Fight Back</em></a><em>, </em>at every single one of those four major airlines, up to a quarter of the attendants reported having health reactions, including rashes and skin burns, breathing problems, hair loss, blurry vision, brain fog, and extreme fatigue. Some attendants had to be taken off their planes and brought to the ER. Though the lawsuit by Delta flight attendants didn’t move forward, in November of this year a jury awarded <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2023/11/02/flight-attendants-toxic-uniforms-verdict/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">over $1 million</a> to four American Airlines flight attendants who said their Twin Hill uniforms made them sick.
</p>
<p>
The next question that arises is: Is this happening to regular folks, too? And the answer is yes, but in more subtle and insidious ways. For example, the kinds of dyes used on synthetic materials like polyester (disperse dyes) <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12165928/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">are well-known to dermatologists</a> to be common skin sensitizers. But many people may not know it’s clothing exacerbating their toddler’s eczema or setting off their own skin problems.
</p>
<p>
But the issue is more serious than just rashes, though rashes are often the first sign that something is wrong. Researchers and advocacy groups have tested fashion from well-known brands and counterfeits alike <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jul/02/fashion-chemicals-pfas-bpa-toxic" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and found</a> heavy metals like lead, chromium, and cadmium; endocrine disruptors like Bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, and per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS); biocides, pesticides, and fungicides; and known carcinogens like benzene, certain azo dyes, and formaldehyde. (This is an abbreviated list, by the way.)
</p>
<p>
We’ve known for a long time these chemicals end up in our water and environment. PFAS, a toxic class of chemicals used for imbuing synthetics with water resistance, has been found all <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/mt-everest-pollution/2021/04/16/7b341ff0-909f-11eb-bb49-5cb2a95f4cec_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">over Mount Everest’s summit</a>, for example. But what we’re increasingly seeing is that our fashion, like our diets, affects our physical health.
</p>
<p>
Take microfibers, which in Heatmap’s <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/change-polling-concern-belief-republicans-vs-democrats" target="_self">recent survey</a> were deemed to be a problem by 61% of respondents, and an “extremely serious” problem by 25% of respondents. When microfibers come off our clothes in the wash or break off our clothes and become part of our house dust, they bring with them everything that is in and on clothing. Given that we’re <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10151227/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ingesting microfibers every day</a>, we <em>are</em> eating our clothes. We’re also breathing in their VOCs, and our sweat is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2023/nov/02/workout-clothes-sweat-chemicals-cancer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pulling those chemicals out of fibers onto our skin</a>, where they can be absorbed into our bloodstream.
</p>
<p>
One of the main reasons fashion has turned from a field-to-closet endeavor to a chemistry experiment is the same as for food: It’s more profitable to sell highly processed, branded products made exclusively from petrochemicals and with a lot of marketing promises than it is to sell traditional pieces made from natural materials.
</p>
<p>
This happens at both ends of the fashion spectrum. At the low end, as Shein has shown, you can grow your company at an unprecedented speed by sourcing huge volumes of $5 polyester minidresses from garment factories <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/30/shein-faces-scrutiny-over-forced-labor-before-ipo.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">with dubious working conditions</a>, according to numerous reports.
</p>
<p>
At the other end, a company can add proprietary, brand-name chemistry like Gore-Tex to outdoor gear and sell it at a huge markup. Just observe <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@chadahooche_/video/7307625278484811051" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a bit currently going around on TikTok</a> where a spouse or partner requests you wear your most expensive clothing to an event or to meet the parents, so you show up in hiking gear.
</p>
<p>
Sure, if you’re a professional fisherman plowing through rough seas for your catch, a first responder, or a scientist living in the Arctic, you may well need high-performance gear. But for the rest of us, it’s just aspirational marketing, kind of like drinking Gatorade while you’re on the couch watching football.

<p>
Like the food industry before it, the fashion industry’s focus when it comes to safe and non-toxic fashion has been on individual chemicals or classes of chemicals instead of the holistic picture. The (completely voluntary) standards used by some fashion brands and certifications will test a textile for a tiny percentage of the <a href="https://icca-chem.org/news/how%E2%80%91do%E2%80%91we%E2%80%91calculate-the%20-number%E2%80%91of%E2%80%91chemicals%E2%80%91in%E2%80%91use-around-the-globe/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tens of thousands</a> of possible chemical substances in circulation, and if each is under the (often arbitrary) limit, the fashion piece will be declared safe.
</p>
<p>
This approach, however, doesn’t take into account how chemicals can mix to have synergistic effects on the same organs or cause the same health effects.
</p>
<p>
For example, it’s completely within the realm of possibility for one clothing item or outfit to have BPA, phthalates, <em>and</em> PFAS, each of which by itself wreaks havoc on our hormonal system, even <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/low-doses-hormone-like-chemicals-may-have-big-effects/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in tiny, tiny amounts</a>. Some of these chemicals are used to process fibers. Some chemicals such as finishes, dyes, and glues are used deliberately and are meant to stay in and on the fashion. Some chemicals are accidental contaminants, as fabrics and components flow through an opaque, unregulated, and just plain sloppy supply chain.
</p>
<p>
That then can affect everything from our reproductive system and energy levels to our skin appearance and weight. And all this while you’re trying to take care of your health by taking a hike or hitting the gym. It kind of reminds me of when cereal brands will brag about the vitamins they’ve added to their sugary, processed cereal.
</p>
<p>
What’s more, unlike food, cleaning products, and beauty products, clothing doesn’t come with a complete ingredient list. Anything under 5% of the weight of the product doesn’t have to be included. So what kind of finishes, dyes, threads, or contaminants are present in any piece of fashion is somewhat of a mystery.
</p>
<p>
When people ask me what they should buy or what they should clean out of their closets, I usually give them a list of things to look for and things to avoid — yes to natural fibers like cotton, wool, linen, bamboo rayon, and silk; no to toxic “vegan” leather polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and other synthetics, which are more likely to contain hazardous or sensitizing chemicals; avoid neon bright colors and buy naturally dyed or undyed products when you can; don’t dry clean your clothes.
</p>
<p>
But a simpler way to think about it would be to avoid clothing and accessories that your grandparents would look askance at, just like Pollan has encouraged us to do at the grocery store. Wait, what is Pertex® 20D Diamond Fuse Ripstop nylon? Or a polyester Lycra® elastane blend with anti-odor technology? What does it mean when something has Durable Water Repellant? What is actually in Memory Foam™ or the smelly glue that bonds it to the bottom of a sneaker? Do you really believe that a piece of clothing that smells like gasoline out of the box is okay for your health — or for anyone’s health? Which sounds better to you: chromium-tanned leather or vegetable-tanned leather?
</p>
<p>
Sure, it may take a bit more time, skill, and investment than buying synthetic clothing that you drop off at the dry cleaner. But then again, so does making a nutritious meal from ingredients you get at the farmer’s market. And, I would argue, both are a core part of cultivating a healthier, more vibrant, community-oriented, and nurturing life.

<h2 id="answers-to-my-analytics-inquiry">Answers to my analytics inquiry</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
I’m aware it’s not Saturday but I realised I didn’t need to collect a full week worth of data to get <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/analytics-inquiry">an answer to my question</a> and so I decided that three full days were enough. I have data for December 30th and 31st and January 1st. That’s more that enough. So let’s do some digging shall we.
</p>
<h2>
A quick acknowledgement
</h2>
<p>
Before I cruch the numbers I want to highlight two people who got in touch mentioning their similar experiments: <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2020/google-vs-netlify-analytics/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Jim Nielsen</a>—who’s also a <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-jim-nielsen">P&amp;B guest</a>—and <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/analytics-for-sites-with-tech-savvy-audiences/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Chris Krycho</a>.
</p>
<h2>
The metrics
</h2>
<p>
I think it’s important to first establish what these tools are measuring. I’m interested in one single data point: how many people have accessed my content. Should be simple enough in theory. That information is often referred to as Unique user or Unique visitor. But how are these tools determining what counts as unique?
</p>
<p>
Plausible doesn’t use cookies and to track unique visitors they do the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Every single HTTP request sends the IP address and the User-Agent to the server so that’s what we use. We generate a daily changing identifier using the visitor’s IP address and User-Agent. To anonymize these datapoints and make them impossible to relate back to the user, we run them through a hash function with a rotating salt.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So a combination of IP and User Agent. So if someone is browsing from different devices they’d probably be counted multiple times. <a href="https://plausible.io/data-policy">More info is available on the Plausible website</a>.
</p>
<p>
Simple Analytics tracks a slightly different metric called “unique visits” which is based, according to their docs, on the referrer. <a href="https://docs.simpleanalytics.com/explained/unique-visits">More info at this page</a>.
</p>
<p>
Fathom tracks “Visitors” defined as:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A visitor is a unique person who’s visited your site.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Not very helpful. I tried to poke around the docs but I couldn’t find how they track it so I’ll move on to the final platform, Pirsch. They do something similar to what Plausible is doing
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Pirsch generates a unique number for each visitor calculated from the visitor’s IP address, the User-Agent, and a random string that is set for each website.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Finally, we have Goaccess, the tool I’m going to use to analyse my server logs. Goaccess defines a Unique Visitor as
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
HTTP requests containing the same IP, the same date, and the same user agent are considered a unique visitor. By default, it includes web crawlers/spiders.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We have our definitions, it’s time to get to some numbers.
</p>
<h2>
The numbers
</h2>
<p>
These are the (Unique) Visitors reported by the four online services and my server logs
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Plausible <code>358</code>
</li>
<li>
Fathom <code>403</code>
</li>
<li>
Pirsch <code>273</code>
</li>
<li>
Simple Analytics <code>728</code>
</li>
<li>
Server Logs <code>3894</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Already, the difference between logs and client analytics is HUGE. But we need to dig a bit deeper into the logs because the situation there is messy. To start, there’s the issue of bots, spiders and crawlers. Goaccess has an optional flag I turned on to ignore a huge number of those. That <code>3894</code> is already ignoring a good % of non-human traffic. But I am sure something is still slipping through. Another thing that is present in my server logs that is obviously not present in the other four tools is RSS traffic because the JS necessary to keep track of the traffic is not included in the RSS feed. If I remove all the entries in my logs mentioning either <code>rss</code> or <code>feed</code> the Unique Visitors go from <code>3894</code> to <code>2111</code>. Lower but still way higher than the client side data that was averaging around <code>440</code>.
</p>
<p>
Clearly more work is needed on these logs because they’re incredibly noisy. I removed all 404s, manually removed all the entries mentioning any type of bot, I also grabbed only entries matching this regex <code>(Gecko|Chrome|Firefox|AppleWebKit|Mac OS|Windows NT|Android)</code>. And that leaves us with <code>1821</code> unique visitors, according to my logs.
</p>
<p>
That number is still a lot higher than what I’m seeing in the online dashboard so what gives? Well, I think something obvious is happening here. I am a web developer with an indie blog that is followed by a lot of people who are also passionate about the web and are tech savvy. So I’d bet the % of people running one or multiple ad blockers between my readers is quite high. An article from the <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/google-analytics-adblockers-missing-data">Plausible blog</a> reports that a huge % of people is blocking google analytics for example but I’m sure modern ad blockers are also preventing these tools to work properly. Hell I had to disable mine just to access those dashboards. My visits to my site were not counted. Estimating the number of people running ad blockers is impossible and a quick online search tells me the numbers are anything between 30% to 65%.
</p>
<p>
If I were to adjust the numbers coming out of the four tools I used based on the 65% which is probably reasonable considering my type of audience we’d get
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Plausible <code>967</code>
</li>
<li>
Fathom <code>1089</code>
</li>
<li>
Pirsch <code>737</code>
</li>
<li>
Simple Analytics <code>1967</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A lot closer to the <code>1821</code> coming out of my server logs. We can probably safely assume that some of those <code>1821</code> are bots cleverly disguised as genuine traffic and the true number has to be somewhere in the <code>~1200</code> range.
</p>
<p>
So, do I finally have an answer? Is <code>~1200</code> the answer I was looking for? Well, not quite. We excluded RSS earlier because it was not part of the data gathered by the four client side tools but RSS traffic is still traffic worth counting. Especially in 2024! Figuring out actual RSS traffic is close to impossible. Goaccess tells me there were <code>1973</code> unique IPs pinging the various feeds on my site. I’m going to follow <a href="https://darekkay.com/blog/rss-subscriber-count/">Darek</a> lead here and simply count exposed subscribers. According to my logs we have:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
12 different Feedbin feeds with unique <code>feed-id</code> for a total of <code>439</code> subscribers;
</li>
<li>
3 instances of Inoreader with very distinct subscribers number for a total of <code>126</code>
</li>
<li>
4 Feedly instances with very distinct subscribers number for a total of <code>391</code>
</li>
<li>
NewsBlur, BazQux Reader, and The Old Reader are the other services exposing subscribers number and combined are other <code>70</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So the total, according to these services is <code>1026</code> subscribers, if my math is correct. Only thing missing to this weird roundup is the <code>110</code> people who are getting my posts directly in their inbox.
</p>
<h2>
The conclusion
</h2>
<p>
Is there even a lesson to be learn here? Don’t trust numbers blindly perhaps? Server logs are messy and can be over inflated while client based analytics can greatly under report your numbers if you have a very tech savvy audience. Also RSS is still doing fine and you should definitely have an RSS feed if you have a personal blog. And if you don’t have a personal blog I don’t know what you’re waiting for.

<h2 id="us-national-debt-hits-record-34-trillion-as-congress-gears-up-for-funding-fight">US National Debt Hits Record $34 Trillion as Congress Gears up for Funding Fight</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The federal government’s gross national debt has surpassed $34 trillion, a record high that foreshadows the coming political and economic challenges to improve America’s balance sheet in the coming years. </p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department issued a report Tuesday logging U.S. finances, which have become a source of tension in a politically divided Washington that could possibly see parts of the government shut down without an annual budget in place. </p>
<p>Republican lawmakers and the White House agreed last June to temporarily lift the nation’s debt limit, staving off the risk of what would be a historic default. That agreement lasts until January 2025. Here are some answers to questions about the new record national debt. </p>
<p>How did the national debt hit $34 trillion?  </p>
<p>The national debt eclipsed $34 trillion several years sooner than pre-pandemic projections. The Congressional Budget Office’s January 2020 projections had gross federal debt eclipsing $34 trillion in fiscal year 2029. </p>
<p>But the debt grew faster than expected because of a multiyear pandemic starting in 2020 that shut down much of the U.S. economy. The government borrowed heavily under then-President Donald Trump and current President Joe Biden to stabilize the economy and support a recovery. But the rebound came with a surge of inflation that pushed up interest rates and made it more expensive for the government to service its debts. </p>
<p>“So far, Washington has been spending money as if we had unlimited resources,” said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at Loyola Marymount University. “But the bottom line is, there is no free lunch,” he said. “And I think the outlook is pretty grim.” </p>
<p>The gross debt includes money that the government owes itself, so most policymakers rely on the total debt held by the public in assessing the government’s finances. This lower figure — $26.9 trillion — is roughly equal in size to the U.S. gross domestic product. </p>
<p>Last June, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in its 30-year outlook that publicly held debt will be equal to a record 181% of American economic activity by 2053. </p>
<p>What is the impact to the economy?  </p>
<p>The national debt does not appear to be a weight on the U.S. economy right now, as investors are willing to lend the federal government money. This lending allows the government to keep spending on programs without having to raise taxes. </p>
<p>But the debt’s path in the decades to come might put at risk national security and major programs, including Social Security and Medicare, which have become the most prominent drivers of forecasted government spending over the next few decades. Government dysfunction, such as another debt limit showdown, could also be a financial risk if investors worry about lawmakers’ willingness to repay the U.S. debt. </p>
<p>Foreign buyers of U.S. debt — like China, Japan, South Korea and European nations — have already cut down on their holdings of Treasury notes. </p>
<p>A Peterson Foundation analysis states that foreign holdings of U.S. debt peaked at 49% in 2011 but dropped to 30% by the end of 2022. </p>
<p>“Looking ahead, debt will continue to skyrocket as the Treasury expects to borrow nearly $1 trillion more by the end of March,” said Peterson Foundation CEO Michael Peterson. "Adding trillion after trillion in debt, year after year, should be a flashing red warning sign to any policymaker who cares about the future of our country. </p>
<p>How could it affect me?  </p>
<p>The debt equates to about $100,000 per person in the U.S. That sounds like a lot, but the sum so far has not appeared to threaten U.S. economic growth. </p>
<p>Instead, the risk is long term if the debt keeps rising to uncharted levels. Sohn said a higher debt load could put upward pressure on inflation and cause interest rates to remain elevated, which could also increase the cost of repaying the national debt. </p>
<p>And as the debt challenge evolves over time, choices may become more severe as the costs of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid increasingly outstrip tax revenues. </p>
<p>When it could turn into a more dire situation is anyone’s guess, says Shai Akabas, director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. "But if and when that happens, it could mean very significant consequences that occur very quickly. </p>
<p>“It could mean spikes in interest rates. It could mean a recession that leads to lots more unemployment. It could lead to another bout of inflation or weird goings-on with consumer prices — several of which are things that we’ve experienced just in the past few years,” he said. </p>
<p>How do Republicans and Democrats differ?  </p>
<p>Both Democrats and Republicans have called for debt reduction, but they disagree on the appropriate means of doing so. </p>
<p>The Biden administration has been pushing for tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations to reduce budget deficits, in addition to funding its domestic agenda. Biden also increased the budget for the IRS so that it can collect unpaid taxes and possibly reduce the debt by hundreds of billions of dollars over 10 years. </p>
<p>Republican lawmakers have called for large cuts to non-defense government programs and the repeal of clean energy tax credits and spending passed in the Inflation Reduction Act. But Republicans also want to trim Biden’s IRS funding and cut taxes further, both of which could cause the debt to worsen. </p>
<p>A Treasury Department representative did not respond to a request for comment. </p>
<p>“There is growing concern among investors and rating agencies that the trajectory we’re on is unsustainable — when that turns into a more dire situation is anyone’s guess,” Akabas said.</p>

<h2 id="prosecutors-add-accusations-to-bribery-indictment-of-us-senator">Prosecutors Add Accusations to Bribery Indictment of US Senator</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — Federal authorities are accusing U.S. Senator Bob Menendez of introducing a member of the Qatari royal family to a New Jersey businessman seeking investments in a real estate project, an indictment said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The indictment against the New Jersey Democrat in Manhattan federal court did not identify the member of the Qatari royal family, but it said the individual was a principal of the Qatari Investment Company.</p>
<p>The indictment said the Qatari investor negotiated a multimillion-dollar investment in the real estate project planned by Fred Daibes, one of three businessmen charged in the indictment along with the senator and his wife. All have pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>Messages left with lawyers and a spokesperson for Menendez were not immediately returned.</p>
<p>Tim Donohue, a lawyer for Daibes, said he had no immediate comment.</p>
<p>The indictment is the latest version of one that already charged Menendez in a bribery conspiracy that allegedly enriched the senator and his wife with cash, gold bars and a luxury car. The charges involving Qatar allegedly occurred from 2021 through 2023, according to the indictment, which did not add any new charges.</p>
<p>After his September arrest, the senator gave up his position as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He has resisted calls to resign from his Senate seat.</p>
<p>According to the indictment, Menendez accepted cash and gold bars in exchange for seeking to induce the Qatari Investment Company to invest with Daibes, including by taking actions favorable to the government of Qatar.</p>
<p>The indictment said that while the Qatari Investment Company was considering its investment in the real estate development owned by Daibes, Menendez made multiple public statements supporting the government of Qatar and then provided them to Daibes so he could share them with a Qatari investor and a Qatari government official.</p>
<p>In an earlier version of the indictment, Menendez, his wife and one of the businessmen were charged with conspiring to illegally use the senator as an agent of the Egyptian government.</p>
<p>Judge Sidney H. Stein, who is presiding over the case, refused last week to extend a May 5 trial date after defense lawyers requested more time to prepare for a trial that they said already includes more than 6.7 million documents.</p>

<h2 id="urinary-microbiota-signatures-associated-with-different-types-of-urinary-diversion-a-comparative-study">Urinary microbiota signatures associated with different types of urinary diversion: a comparative study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Radical cystectomy and urinary diversion (UD) are gold standards for non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Orthotopic neobladder (or Studer), ileal conduit (or Bricker) and cutaneous ureterostomy (CU) are mainstream UD types. Little is known about urinary microbiological changes after UD.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
In this study, urine samples were collected from healthy volunteers and patients with bladder cancer who had received aforementioned UD procedures. Microbiomes of samples were analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, and microbial diversities, distributions and functions were investigated and compared across groups.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Highest urine microbial richness and diversity were observed in healthy controls, followed by Studer patients, especially those without hydronephrosis or residual urine, α-diversity indices of whom were remarkably higher than those of Bricker and CU groups. Studer UD type was the only independent factor favoring urine microbial diversity. The urine microflora structure of the Studer group was most similar to that of the healthy individuals while that of the CU group was least similar. Studer patients and healthy volunteers shared many similar urine microbial functions, while Bricker and CU groups exhibited opposite characteristics.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Our study first presented urinary microbial landscapes of UD patients and demonstrated the microbiological advantage of orthotopic neobladder. Microbiota might be a potential tool for optimization of UD management.

<h2 id="human-and-animal-exposure-to-newly-discovered-sand-fly-viruses-china">Human and animal exposure to newly discovered sand fly viruses, China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
The Hedi virus (HEDV) and Wuxiang virus (WUXV) are newly discovered Bunyaviruses transmitted by sandflies. The geographical distribution of isolation of these two viruses continues to expand and it has been reported that WUXV causes neurological symptoms and even death in suckling mice. However, little is known about the prevalence of the two viruses in mammalian infections.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
In order to understand the infection status of HEDV and WUXV in humans and animals from regions where the viruses have been isolated, this study used Western blotting to detect the positive rates of HEDV and WUXV IgG antibodies in serum samples from febrile patients, dogs, and chickens in the forementioned regions.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The results showed that of the 29 human serum samples, 17.24% (5/29) tested positive for HEDV, while 68.96% (20/29) were positive for WUXV. In the 31 dog serum samples, 87.10% (27/31) were positive for HEDV and 70.97% (22/31) were positive for WUXV, while in the 36 chicken serum samples, 47.22% (17/36) were positive for HEDV, and 52.78% (19/36) were positive for WUXV.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
These findings suggest there are widespread infections of HEDV and WUXV in mammals (dogs, chickens) and humans from the regions where these viruses have been isolated. Moreover, the positive rate of HEDV infections was higher in local animals compared to that measured in human specimens. This is the first seroepidemiological study of these two sandfly-transmitted viruses. The findings of the study have practical implications for vector-borne viral infections and related zoonotic infections in China, as well as providing an important reference for studies on the relationship between sandfly-transmitted viruses and zoonotic infections outside of China.

<h2 id="transovarial-transmission-of-mosquito-borne-viruses-a-systematic-review">Transovarial transmission of mosquito-borne viruses: a systematic review</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
A number of mosquito-borne viruses (MBVs), such as dengue virus (DENV), zika virus (ZIKV), chikungunya (CHIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), and yellow fever virus (YFV) exert adverse health impacts on the global population. <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> are the prime vectors responsible for the transmission of these viruses. The viruses have acquired a number of routes for successful transmission, including horizontal and vertical transmission. Transovarial transmission is a subset/type of vertical transmission adopted by mosquitoes for the transmission of viruses from females to their offspring through eggs/ovaries. It provides a mechanism for these MBVs to persist and maintain their lineage during adverse climatic conditions of extremely hot and cold temperatures, during the dry season, or in the absence of susceptible vertebrate host when horizontal transmission is not possible.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
The publications discussed in this systematic review were searched for using the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, and websites such as those of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, using the search terms “transovarial transmission” and “mosquito-borne viruses” from 16 May 2023 to 20 September 2023.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
A total of 2,391 articles were searched, of which 123 were chosen for full text evaluation, and 60 were then included in the study after screening and removing duplicates.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
The present systematic review focuses on understanding the above diseases, their pathogenesis, epidemiology and host–parasite interactions. The factors affecting transovarial transmission, potential implications, mosquito antiviral defense mechanism, and the control strategies for these mosquito-borne viral diseases (MBVDs) are also be included in this review.

<h2 id="the-impact-of-helicobacter-pylori-infection-on-low-skeletal-muscle-mass-risk-in-chinese-women-over-40-a-cross-sectional-analysis">The impact of Helicobacter pylori infection on low skeletal muscle mass risk in Chinese women over 40: a cross-sectional analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Sarcopenia can lead to significant personal, social, and economic burdens. The diagnosis of sarcopenia heavily relies on the identification of Low Skeletal Muscle Mass (LSMM), which is an independent predictor of frailty, disability, and increased risk of death among seniors. Women have physiologically lower levels of skeletal muscle mass than men, and female sarcopenia appears to be more influenced by menopause. They also tend to have higher body fat levels than man, which increases the risk of sarcopenia obesity. On another front, it’s also recognized that humans are largely prone to <italic>Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)</italic> infection, with global prevalence rates often surpassing 50%. Nevertheless, the interconnection between <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and LSMM remains relatively unexplored. Hence, our study specifically targeted women as the research population and sought to explore several risk factors for LSMM. Additionally, we delved into the potential correlation between LSMM and <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection in women, hoping to gain insights into potential preventative measures or treatment options that may enhance the quality of life for women affected by sarcopenia.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We conducted a cross-sectional study among women aged over 18 years undergoing physical examination. We performed 13C-urea breath test (UBT) for diagnosis of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) for the assessment of LSMM. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the associations of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection with LSMM.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
This study enrolled 1984 Chinese women who were undergoing health check-ups. A univariate logistic regression analysis did not reveal a direct correlation between <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and LSMM among this female population (OR=1.149, 95% CI 0.904-1.459, <italic>p</italic>=0.257). Yet, upon dividing the participants into age-based subgroups, an evident link was observed between <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and LSMM in women aged 40 or above (OR=1.381, 95%CI 1.032-1.848, <italic>p</italic>= 0.030). After adjusting for variables including Age, BMI, TP, ALK, Cre, this relationship remained statistically relevant (OR=1.514, 95%CI 1.085-2.113, <italic>p</italic>= 0.015).
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
Women who are over 40 years old and currently infected with <italic>H. pylori</italic> have an increased risk of developing LSMM. Therefore, timely treatment for <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication is recommended for this group of women to reduce the occurrence of LSMM.

<h2 id="the-crosstalk-of-intratumor-bacteria-and-the-tumor">The crosstalk of intratumor bacteria and the tumor</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<p>
The in-depth studies reveal the interaction between the host and commensal microbiomes. Symbiotic bacteria influence in tumor initiation, progression, and response to treatment. Recently, intratumor bacteria have been a burgeoning research field. The tumor microenvironment is under vascular hyperplasia, aerobic glycolysis, hypoxia, and immunosuppression. It might be attractive for bacterial growth and proliferation. As a component of the tumor microenvironment, intratumor bacteria influence tumor growth and metastasis, as well as the efficacy of anti-tumor therapies. Therefore, understanding the intricate interplay of intratumoral bacteria and the host might contribute to better approaches to treat tumors. In this review, we summarize current evidence about roles of intratumor bacteria in tumor initiation and anti-tumor therapy, and what is remained to be solved in this field.

<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Objectives
</title>
<p>
This study was performed to explore the preventive and therapeutic effects of <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> ZFM4 on H. pylori infections of the stomach tissue in C57BL/6 mice.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
In this study, 40 specific-pathogen-free female C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into five groups, namely, the control, ZFM4 pretreatment) ZFM4 pretreatment before <italic>H. pylori</italic> infected), model (<italic>H. pylori</italic> infected), triple therapy (<italic>H. pylori</italic> infected and treated with triple therapy), and ZFM4 treatment groups (<italic>H. pylori</italic> infected and treated with ZFM4). The preventive and therapeutic effects of <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> ZFM4 were evaluated in <italic>H. pylori-</italic>infected C57BL/6 mice by assessing gastric tissue morphology, inflammatory cytokine levels, microbial composition, and microbial diversity.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
<italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> ZFM4 was able to survive in low gastric pH and play a role in preventing <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection. This was evident from a reduction in both, the gastric inflammatory response and expression of inflammatory factors caused by <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection. <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> ZFM4 could also inhibit the growth of <italic>H. pylori</italic> via its beneficial impact on the gastric microbiota.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Our findings suggest that <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> ZFM4 offers superior preventive effects against <italic>H. pylori</italic> infections when used alone. However, the therapeutic effect on established infections is weaker. Further clinical trials are needed to confirm the specific dosage, duration, and other aspects of administration.
