## Start-up incubator Y Combinator backs its first weapons firm

## Microsoft’s Copilot falsely accuses court reporter of crimes he covered

date: 2024-08-25, from: OS News

German journalist Martin Bernklau typed his name and location into Microsoft&#8217;s Copilot to see how his culture blog articles would be picked up by the chatbot, according to German public broadcaster SWR. The answers shocked Bernklau. Copilot falsely claimed Bernklau had been charged with and convicted of child abuse and exploiting dependents. It also claimed that he had been involved in a dramatic escape from a psychiatric hospital and had exploited grieving women as an unethical mortician. Copilot even went so far as to claim that it was &#8220;unfortunate&#8221; that someone with such a criminal past had a family and,&#160;according to SWR, provided Bernklau&#8217;s full address with phone number and route planner. ↫ Matthias Bastian So why did Copilot (which is just OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT with sparkles) claim Bernklau did all sorts of horrible things? Well, his occupation &#8211; journalist &#8211; is a dead giveaway. He has written a lot of articles covering court proceedings in Tübingen on abuse, violence, and fraud cases, and since Copilot is just spicy autocorrect, it has no understanding of context and pinned the various crimes he covered on Bernklau. Adding in his address, phone number, and a damn planned route to his home is just the very disgusting icing on this already disgusting cake. What makes matters even worse, if you can believe it, is that Bernklau has absolutely no recourse. He contacted the public prosecutor&#8217;s office in Tübingen, but they stated they can&#8217;t press charges because the accusations coming from Copilot aren&#8217;t being made by a real person. And to make it still even worse, Microsoft just threw its hands in the air and absolved itself of any and all responsibility by pointing to its terms of service, in which Microsoft discards liability for content generated by Copilot. Convenient. This is nothing short of a nightmare scenario that can utterly destroy someone&#8217;s life, and the fact that Microsoft doesn&#8217;t care and the law isn&#8217;t even remotely prepared to take serious matters like these on is terrifying.

## Hurricane Hone sweeps past Hawaii, dumping enough rain to ease wildfire fears

date: 2024-08-25, from: VOA News USA

HONOLULU — Hurricane Hone passed just south of Hawaii early Sunday, dumping enough rain for the National Weather Service to call off its red flag warnings that strong winds could cause wildfires on the drier sides of islands in the archipelago.


Hone had top winds of 80 mph (130 kph), according to a 2 a.m. advisory from the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu, and was moving west near the southernmost point of the Big Island, close enough to sweep the coast with tropical storm force winds and to drop up to a foot (30 centimeters) or more of rain on the windward and southeast-facing slopes of the Big Island, with locally higher amounts possible. 


Hurricane Gilma, meanwhile, increased to a Category 4 hurricane Saturday night, but it was still about 1,480 miles (2,380 kilometers) east of Hilo and forecast to weaken into a depression before it reaches Hawaii.


"Hone's main threats to the state continue to be the potential for heavy rainfall leading to flooding, damaging winds and large surf along east-facing shores," the weather service advised early Sunday. 


Some Big Island beach parks were closed due to dangerously high surf and officials were preparing to open shelters if needed, Big Island Mayor Mitch Roth said.


Hone, whose name is Hawaiian for "sweet and soft," poked at memories still fresh of last year's deadly blazes on Maui, which were fueled by hurricane-force winds. Red flag alerts are issued when warm temperatures, very low humidity and stronger winds combine to raise fire dangers. Most of the archipelago is already abnormally dry or in drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.


"They gotta take this thing serious," said Calvin Endo, a Waianae Coast neighborhood board member who lives in Makaha, a leeward Oahu neighborhood prone to wildfires.


The Aug. 8, 2023, blaze that torched the historic town of Lahaina was the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century, with 102 dead. Dry, overgrown grasses and drought helped spread the fire.


For years, Endo has worried about dry brush on private property behind his home. He's taken matters into his own hands by clearing the brush himself, but he's concerned about nearby homes abutting overgrown vegetation.


"All you need is fire and wind and we'll have another Lahaina," Endo said Saturday. "I notice the wind started to kick up already."


The cause of the Lahaina blaze is still under investigation, but it's possible it was ignited by bare electrical wire and leaning power poles toppled by the strong winds. The state's two power companies, Hawaiian Electric and the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative, were prepared to shut off power if necessary to reduce the chance that live, damaged power lines could start fires, but they later said the safety measures would not be necessary as Hone blew past the islands. 


Roth said a small blaze that started Friday night in Waikoloa, on the dry side of the Big Island, was brought under control without injuries or damage.

## US rapper Macklemore cancels Dubai gig over alleged UAE role in Sudan war

date: 2024-08-25, from: VOA News USA

Dubai, United Arab Emirates — U.S. rapper Macklemore has announced he is cancelling an upcoming show in Dubai over the UAE's involvement in the conflict in Sudan, charges the Gulf state has denied.


The rapper best known for hits like 2012's "Thrift Shop" made the announcement in a post on social media on Saturday.


"I have decided to cancel my upcoming show in Dubai this October," he said.


"Over the last several months I've had a number of people reach out to me, sharing resources and asking me to cancel the show in solidarity with the people of Sudan," he said.


"Until the UAE stops arming and funding the RSF I will not perform there," Macklemore added, referring to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces that have been battling the Sundanese army.


War has raged since April 2023 between the Sudanese army, under the country's de facto ruler Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the RSF, which is commanded by Burhan's former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.


For months, the army has accused the UAE of supporting the RSF.


In June, Sudan's ambassador to the United Nations Al-Harith Idriss al-Harith Mohamed called Abu Dhabi's financial and military support for the RSF the "main reason behind this protracted war."


The UAE has denied allegations of RSF support as "disinformation," saying that it's efforts are focused exclusively towards de-escalation and alleviating Sudan's humanitarian suffering.


Macklemore has released socially aware music in the past, supporting LGBTQ+ rights while also criticizing ills including poverty and consumerism.


In his latest track released in May, Macklemore voices support for Palestinians and also praises students across the United States protesting against Israel's war in Gaza.


The song, "Hind's Hall," is named after a building at Columbia University that students recently occupied and renamed after Hind Rajab, a six-year-old Palestinian girl killed in Gaza.

## Weeks after floods, Vermont businesses struggling to get visitors to return

date: 2024-08-25, from: VOA News USA

burke, vermont — Two bouts of flooding from storms in July has hampered businesses and destinations in an economically depressed section of northern Vermont, with some still closed as they continue to repair damage and others urging visitors, who were deterred by the weather, to make the trip. 


Kingdom Trails, a popular destination for mountain bikers, draws tens of thousands of visitors a year. But the storms that hit the region on July 10 and July 30 washed away some roads and bridges, damaged homes and trails, and discouraged visitors at the height of the season. 


Businesses and destinations are picking up the pieces, with some still closed in nearby Lyndonville, while others want to get the word out that they are very much open. 


"I can't stress enough that we are open and our community is welcoming people," said Abby Long, executive director of Kingdom Trails. "We're encouraging folks to not only come visit Kingdom Trails and have an awesome time but sign up to volunteer mucking and gutting houses for the morning and then relax on the trails in the afternoon." 




The storms caused $300,000 in damages to the trails — and that doesn't account for the loss of membership revenue, she said. The trails were closed for about a day and a half as crews worked furiously to get them back open. The cost of repairs comes on top of the $150,000 in damages suffered in last summer's flooding. 


"That is not sustainable," Long said. 


So far, 341 businesses in Vermont have reported flood damage to the state this year, according to Economic Development Commissioner Joan Goldstein. Last summer, about 1,100 businesses were affected, she said. 


In Lyndonville, a popular diner that had been in business since 1978 will not be reopening after getting damaged in the July 10 storms. The owner of the Miss Lyndonville Diner is having repairs done and plans to sell the restaurant. She told the Caledonian Record that the flooding convinced her it was time to retire. 


Leaving ski industry


The nearby Village Sport Shop, which also has been in business for nearly 50 years, has decided to close its flooded Lyndonville shop and exit the ski industry, according to a social media post by the business. 


"With the multiple flooding events we have endured and the evolution we have needed to take as a business, we have come to the decision it is time to turn our focus towards the summer side of the business and relieve ourselves from the flood risks the lowest lying real estate on the strip endures," the post said. The business has a trailside bicycle shop in East Burke. 


A bagel shop and a Walgreens drugstore were still temporarily closed as they recover from the flood damage. 




On Tuesday, President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration making federal funding available to help individuals and communities recover from the July 9-10 flooding from the remnants of Hurricane Beryl. Governor Phil Scott has requested a separate disaster declaration for the July 30 storms and flooding. 


In May, Vermont became the first state to enact a law requiring fossil fuel companies to pay a share of the damage caused by extreme weather fanned by climate change. But officials have acknowledged that collecting any money will depend on litigation against a much-better-resourced oil industry. 


In Burke, a town of about 1,650 that is home to the Burke Mountain ski area, Kingdom Trails is a huge economic driver, said Town Administrator Jim Sullivan. 


"It's traumatic, it's unbelievable the extent that it ripples out," he said. "If Kingdom Trails can't open, people cancel their reservations at the Airbnbs and at the inns. We have restaurants that are counting on all of those people coming here. And it's just a chain event that eventually dwindles where you have these absolutely beautiful days and you just don't have the people here that we normally would have if we didn't have this devastation." 


'Screeching halt'


The East Burke Market was having a really good summer but when the trails closed down, business "came to a bit of a screeching halt," said co-owner Burton Hinton. 


Each of the storms caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in road and property damage, Sullivan said. The town lost a bridge in the July 10 flooding and the whole mountain road in the storm weeks later, he said. 


"We're still waiting for some direction from the federal government. In the meantime, everybody has really come together and done a great job of helping each other. True community," he said. 


About 60 student-athletes who race in cross-country mountain biking with the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Cycling League, and 40 coaches, were in Burke to train at Kingdom Trails when the latest flooding hit on July 30. 


The group had to pivot to ride on gravel for a few days but then some trails reopened quickly, said Michael Morrell, with the National Interscholastic Cycling Association, who was with them. 


"The trail system up here and the trail crew are just so efficient, and the trails, many of the trails, they drain very well," he said on August 1. 


Still, he said he felt terrible for those reliant on getting tourists to visit the local trails. 


"I feel so bad that their roads are closed," Morrell said. " ... We're just glad that we can help support them in any way we can."

## US crossword fan creates puzzles celebrating Black heritage

date: 2024-08-25, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — It started a couple of years ago when Juliana Pache was doing a crossword puzzle and got stuck.


She was unfamiliar with the reference that the clue made. It made her think about what a crossword puzzle would look like if the clues and answers included more of some subjects that she was familiar with, thanks to her own identity and interests — Black history and Black popular culture.


When she couldn't find such a thing, Pache decided to do it herself. In January 2023, she created blackcrossword.com, a site that offers a free mini-crossword puzzle every day. And Tuesday marked the release of her first book, Black Crossword: 100 Mini Puzzles Celebrating the African Diaspora.


It's a good moment for it, nearly 111 years after the first crossword appeared in a New York newspaper. Recent years have seen an increasing amount of conversation around representation in crossword puzzles, from who's constructing them to what words can be used for answers and how the clues are framed. There's been a push to expand the idea of the kinds of "common knowledge" players would have to fill them out.


"I had never made a crossword puzzle before," Pache, 32, said with a laugh. "But I was like, ‘I can figure it out.’"


And she did.


Made 'with Black people in mind'


Each puzzle on Pache's site includes at least a few clues and answers connecting to Black culture. The tagline on the site: "If you know, you know."


The book is brimming with the kinds of puzzles that she estimates about 2,200 people play daily on her site — squares made up of five lines, each with five spaces. She aims for at least three of the clues to be references to aspects of Black cultures from around the world.


Pache, a native of the New York City borough of Queens with family ties to Cuba and the Dominican Republic, had a couple of goals in mind when she started. Primarily, she wanted to create something that Black people would enjoy.


"I'm making it with Black people in mind," she said. "And then if anyone else enjoys it, they learn things from it, that's a bonus but it's not my focus."


She's also trying to show the diversity in Black communities and cultures with the clues and words she uses, and to encourage people from different parts of the African diaspora to learn about each other.


"I also want to make it challenging, not just for people who might be interested in Black culture, but people within Black culture who might be interested in other regions," she said. "Part of my mission with this is to highlight Black people from all over, Black culture from all over. And I think ... that keeps us learning about each other."


What, really, is 'general knowledge'?


While on the surface if might just seem like a game, the knowledge base required for crosswords does say something about what kind of knowledge is considered "general" and "universal" and what isn't, said Michelle Pera-McGhee, a data journalist at The Pudding, a site that focuses on data-driven stories.


In 2020, Pera-McGhee undertook a data project analyzing crossword puzzles through the decades from a handful of the most well-known media outlets. The project assessed clues and answers that used the names of real people to determine a breakdown along gender and race categories.


Unsurprisingly, the data indicated that for the most part, men were disproportionately more likely than women to be featured, as well as white people compared to racial and ethnic minorities.


It's "interesting because it's supposed to be easy," Pera-McGhee said. "You want ... ideally to reference things that people, everybody knows about because everyone learns about them in school or whatever. ... What are the things that we decide we all should know?"


There are efforts to make crosswords more accessible and representative, including the recently started fellowship for puzzle constructors from underrepresented groups at The New York Times, among the most high-profile crossword puzzles around. Puzzle creators have made puzzles aimed at LGBTQ+ communities, at women, using a wider array of references as Pache is doing.


Bottom line, "it is really cool to see our culture reflected in this medium," Pache said.


And, Pera-McGhee said, it can be cool to learn new things.


"It's kind of enriching to have things in the puzzle that you don't know about," she said. "It's not that the experience of not knowing is bad. It's just that it should maybe be spread out along with the experience of knowing. Both are kind of good in the crossword-solving experience."

## Unusual weather leads to summer snowfall in western mountains of US

date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA

YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, California — An unusually cold weather system from the Gulf of Alaska interrupted summer along the West Coast of the United States on Saturday, bringing snow to Washington state's Mount Rainier and a lookout point of California's Sierra Nevada.


Photos posted by the National Weather Service and local authorities showed a white-covered peak from Rainier and a dusting of snow at Minaret Vista, a lookout point southeast of Yosemite National Park in California's Sierra Nevada.


Madera County Deputy Sheriff Larry Rich said it was "definitely unexpected" to see snow at Minaret Vista in August.


"It's not every day you get to spend your birthday surrounded by a winter wonderland in the middle of summer," he said in a statement. "It made for a day I won't soon forget, and a unique reminder of why I love serving in this area. It's just one of those moments that makes working up here so special."


Snow also fell overnight on Mammoth Mountain, a ski destination in California, with the National Weather Service warning hikers and campers to prepare for slick roads.


More light snow was possible in California on the crest of the Sierra Nevada, mostly around Tioga Pass and higher elevations of Yosemite National Park, the National Weather Service said.




August snow has not occurred in those locations since 2003, forecasters said.


Tioga Pass rises to more than 9,900 feet (3,017 meters) and serves as the eastern entryway to Yosemite. But it is usually closed much of each year by winter snow that can take one or two months to clear.


"While this snow will not stay around very long, roads near Tioga Pass could be slick and any campers and hikers should prepare for winter conditions," the weather service wrote.


While the start of ski season is at least several months away, the hint of winter was welcomed by resorts.


"It's a cool and blustery August day here at Palisades Tahoe, as a storm that could bring our first snowfall of the season moves in this afternoon!" the resort said in a social media post Friday.


The "anomalous cool conditions" will spread over much of the western U.S. by Sunday morning, according to the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.




Despite the expected precipitation, forecasters also warned of fire danger because of gusty winds associated with the passage of the cold front.


At the same time, a flash flood watch was issued for the burn scar of California's largest wildfire so far this year from Friday morning through Saturday morning.


The Park Fire roared across more than 671 square miles (1,748 square kilometers) after it erupted in late July near the Central Valley city of Chico and climbed up the western slope of the Sierra.


The fire became California's fourth largest on record, but it has been substantially tamed recently. Islands of vegetation continue to burn within its existing perimeter, but evacuation orders have been canceled.


California's wildfire season got off to an intense start amid extreme July heat. Blazes fed on dried-out vegetation that grew during back-to-back wet years. Fire activity has recently fallen into a relative lull.


Forecasts call for a rapid return of summer heat as the cold front departs.

## While in Taiwan, Haley says isolationist policy not ‘healthy’

date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA

TAIPEI, Taiwan — Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on a visit to Taiwan Saturday that an isolationist policy isn't "healthy" and called on the Republican Party to stand with her country's allies, while still putting in good words for the party's nominee, Donald Trump.


Haley, who ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, told reporters in the capital, Taipei, that supporting U.S. allies, including Ukraine and Israel, is vital. She underscored the importance of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory, to be brought under control by force if necessary.


"I don't think the isolationist approach is healthy. I think America can never sit in a bubble and think that we won't be affected," she said.


While the U.S. doesn't formally recognize Taiwan, it is the island's strongest backer and main arms provider. However, Trump's attempt to reclaim the presidency has fueled worries. He said Taiwan should pay for U.S. protection in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek published in July and dodged answering the question of whether he would defend the island against a possible Chinese military action.




When Haley shuttered her own bid for the Republican nomination, she did not immediately endorse Trump, having accused him of causing chaos and disregarding the importance of U.S. alliances abroad. But in May she said she would be voting for him, while making it clear that she felt her former boss had work to do to win over voters who supported her.


On Saturday, she spoke in Trump's favor. She said that having previously served with Trump's administration, "we did show American strength in the world," pointing to their pushback against China and their sanctioning of Russia and North Korea, among other efforts.


"I think that all of that strength that we showed is the reason that we didn't see any wars, we didn't see any invasions, we didn't see any harm that happened during that time. I think Donald Trump would bring that back," she said.


Trump has claimed that if elected, he would end the conflict in Ukraine before Inauguration Day in January. But Russia's United Nations ambassador said he can't. Trump's public comments have varied between criticizing U.S. backing for Ukraine's defense and supporting it, while his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, has been a leader of Republican efforts to block what have been billions in U.S. military and financial assistance to Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022.


Concerns among Ukraine and its supporters that the country could lose vital U.S. support have increased as Trump's campaign surged.


Haley criticized Trump's rival, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, saying she would "do exactly" what President Joe Biden had done. She said Harris was part of his administration when the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 2021, when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and when the Hamas-Israel war broke out last year.


"She was in the situation room right next to Joe Biden. She was there making the exact same decisions. Those decisions have made the world less safe," she said.




Haley added that while the Republicans and Democrats may not currently concur on much, they agree on "the threats of China," adding that Taiwan is now looking "to make sure that if China starts a fight with them, that they are prepared to make sure that they can fight back."


She said her party should stand with the country's allies and make sure that U.S. shows strength around the world. She also said any authoritarian regime and "communists" harming or hurting other free countries should be a personal matter to the U.S.


"We don't want to see communist China win. We don't want to see Russia win. We don't want to see Iran or North Korea win," she said.


Haley met Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te during this week's trip. She called for more international backing for the self-ruled island, a coordinated pushback against China's claims over it, and for Taiwan to become a full member of the United Nations.


Taiwan's Defense Ministry said Saturday that 38 warplanes and 12 vessels from China were detected around the island during a 24-hour period from Friday morning. Thirty-two of the planes crossed the middle of the line of the Taiwan Strait, an unofficial boundary that's considered a buffer between the island and mainland.

## Adding 16 KB page size to Android

date: 2024-08-24, from: OS News

A page is the granularity at which an operating system manages memory. Most CPUs today support a 4 KB page size and so the Android OS and applications have historically been built and optimized to run with a 4 KB page size. ARM CPUs support the larger 16 KB page size. When Android uses this larger page size, we observe an&#160;overall performance boost of 5-10%&#160;while using ~9% additional memory. In order to improve the operating system performance overall and to give device manufacturers an option to make this trade-off, Android 15 can run with 4 KB or 16 KB page sizes. ↫ Steven Moreland Android 15 has been reworked to be page-size agnostic, meaning that a single binary can run on either 4 KB or 16 KB versions of Android. Any assumptions about page size have been removed from Android as well, the EROFS and F2FS file systems as well as UFS are now compatible with 16 KB, and a whole lot more things have been changed and refactored to make this transition as effortless as possible. Application developers do need to do a few things, though. They&#8217;ll need to recompile their binaries with 16 KB alignment, after which they&#8217;ll need to be tested in a 16 KB version of an Android device or emulator. To make this possible, starting with Android 15 QPR1, the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro will get a new develop option that will reboot the device in 16 KB mode. In addition, Android Studio will gain a 16 KB emulator target as well. The 16 KB page size is an ARM-only feature, so people running the emulator on x86 devices will emulate the 16 KB page size, in which &#8220;the Kernel runs in 4 KB mode, but all addresses exposed to applications are aligned to 16 KB&#8221;. Of course, Google urges Android developers to test for 16 KB page sizes as soon as possible.

## NASA decides to keep 2 stranded astronauts in space until February

date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA

CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — NASA decided Saturday it’s too risky to bring two astronauts back to Earth in Boeing’s troubled new capsule, and they'll have to wait until next year for a ride home with SpaceX. What should have been a weeklong test flight for the pair will now last more than eight months.


The seasoned pilots have been stuck at the International Space Station since the beginning of June. A cascade of vexing thruster failures and helium leaks in the new capsule marred their trip to the space station, and they ended up in a holding pattern as engineers conducted tests and debated what to do about the trip back.


After almost three months, the decision finally came down from NASA’s highest ranks on Saturday. Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will come back in a SpaceX spacecraft in February. Their empty Starliner capsule will undock in a week or two and attempt to return on autopilot.


As Starliner’s test pilots, the pair should have overseen this critical last leg of the journey, with touchdown in the U.S. desert.


It was a blow to Boeing, adding to the safety concerns plaguing the company on its airplane side. Boeing had counted on Starliner’s first crew trip to revive the troubled program after years of delays and ballooning costs. The company had insisted Starliner was safe based on all the recent thruster tests in space and on the ground.


The astronauts


Retired Navy captains with previous long-duration spaceflight experience, Wilmore, 61, and Williams, 58, anticipated surprises when they accepted the shakedown cruise of a new spacecraft, although not quite to this extent.


Before their June 5 launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, they said their families bought into the uncertainty and stress of their professional careers decades ago. During their lone orbital news conference last month, they said they had trust in the thruster testing being conducted. They had no complaints, they added, and enjoyed pitching in with space station work.


Wilmore's wife, Deanna, was equally stoic in an interview earlier this month with WVLT-TV in Knoxville, Tennessee, their home state. She was already bracing for a delay until next February: “You just sort of have to roll with it."


There were few options.


The SpaceX capsule currently parked at the space station is reserved for the four residents who have been there since March. They will return in late September, their stay extended a month by the Starliner dilemma. NASA said it would be unsafe to squeeze two more into the capsule, except in an emergency.


The docked Russian Soyuz capsule is even tighter, capable of flying only three — two of them Russians wrapping up a yearlong stint.


So, Wilmore and Williams will wait for SpaceX's next taxi flight. It’s due to launch in late September with two astronauts instead of the usual four for a routine six-month stay. NASA yanked two to make room for Wilmore and Williams on the return flight in late February.


NASA said no serious consideration was given to asking SpaceX for a quick stand-alone rescue. Last year, the Russian Space Agency had to rush up a replacement Soyuz capsule for three men whose original craft was damaged by space junk. The switch pushed their mission beyond a year, a U.S. space endurance record still held by Frank Rubio.


 




History of problems


Starliner’s woes began long before its latest flight.


Bad software fouled the first test flight without a crew in 2019, prompting a do-over in 2022. Then parachute and other issues cropped up, including a helium leak in the capsule’s propellant system that nixed a launch attempt in May. The leak was deemed isolated and small enough to pose no concern. But more leaks sprouted following liftoff, and five thrusters also failed.


All but one of those small thrusters restarted in flight. But engineers remain perplexed as to why some thruster seals appear to swell, obstructing the propellant lines, then revert to their normal size.


These 28 thrusters are vital. Besides being needed for space station rendezvous, they keep the capsule pointed in the right direction at flight’s end as bigger engines steer the craft out of orbit. Coming in crooked could result in catastrophe.


With the Columbia disaster still fresh in many minds — the shuttle broke apart during reentry in 2003, killing all seven aboard — NASA embraced open debate over Starliner’s return capability. Dissenting views were stifled during Columbia’s doomed flight, just as they were during Challenger’s in 1986.


Despite Saturday's decision, NASA isn’t giving up on Boeing.


NASA went into its commercial crew program a decade ago wanting two competing U.S. companies ferrying astronauts in the post-shuttle era. Boeing won the bigger contract: more than $4 billion, compared with SpaceX’s $2.6 billion.


With station supply runs already under its belt, SpaceX aced its first of now nine astronaut flights in 2020, while Boeing got bogged down in design flaws that set the company back more than $1 billion. NASA officials still hold out hope that Starliner’s problems can be corrected in time for another crew flight in another year or so.

## Thoughts on symbols

date: 2024-08-24, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>Yesterday <a href="https://symbol.fediverse.info/">this proposal for a new symbol</a> for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">fediverse</a> was making the rounds. People made comments on it. People always make comments. We all do. Some liked it, some thought it reminds a bunch of snowflakes (it kinda does), others think it’s not bad but the old one is better. Every time someone “rebrands” something this type of reaction is pretty common. My first thought when I saw it was “Does the fediverse need a symbol?”.</p>
<p>In their proposal, the first thing they explain is how this is a typographical character that can be copy pasted everywhere. Cool, I guess. The second is the original meaning of the symbol:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It refers to groups of stars in the sky, akin to constellations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then they explain why they think it’s a good symbol:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We suggest that it’s a very fitting symbol for the fediverse, a galaxy of interconnected spaces which is decentralised and has an astronomically-themed name. It represents several stars coming together, connecting but each their own, without a centre.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m no astrophysicist, and if what I’m saying is wrong I’m sure <a href="https://briankoberlein.com/">Brian</a> will correct me, but I’m pretty sure galaxies do have a centre. And also, the last thing you want is to have “several stars coming together” because that’s gonna end badly.</p>
<p>Also, and probably quite fittingly, stars in the sky only give us here on earth the illusion of being in some way connected while in reality there’s no connection and are all incredibly far apart. But hey, maybe that was an intentional secret meaning behind this starry-themed symbol they picked. But I digress.</p>
<p>After describing the meaning they then explain what the fediverse is and only then they address the most important question which is why do you need a symbol in the first place.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the interconnected nature of the fediverse, it usually doesn’t matter if someone is a member of one platform or another. What matters is that they can follow each other as part of the fediverse. A single symbol to represent that belonging can often be more relevant than individual icons for each service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, to me, means absolutely nothing. But also, I think trying to unify people behind a silly symbol is the wrong move. And it’s also a misguided effort. A new symbol doesn’t solve anything and doesn’t help your cause. Also, <em>"A single symbol to represent that belonging can often be more relevant than individual icons for each service"</em> belonging to what? I am no fediverse citizen but I do consider myself a good citizen of the web. I try my best to make it a better place and I try to encourage people to own their corners of the web. Am I excluded from your fancy club because I don’t “federate”? Are you saying I don’t belong? I’m asking this rhetorically, because frankly speaking, I couldn’t give less of a fuck about belonging to some arbitrary definition.</p>
<p>Stop trying to make everything about symbols and flags and tribes. It’s not helping.</p>                <hr>

## Fed's actions spoke louder than words in inflation fight, research shows

date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA

JACKSON HOLE, Wyoming — The Federal Reserve's credibility in the eyes of financial markets helped in its battle against inflation over the past two years, but it had to be earned afresh with interest rate hikes that backed up policymakers' verbal promises to restore price stability, according to new research presented at the Kansas City Fed's annual research conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.


A strong perception in financial markets that a central bank is committed to inflation control can make monetary policy more effective, prompting markets to shift financial conditions faster and lowering inflation with a less-serious hit to economic growth than would otherwise be the case.


While investors came to believe that the U.S. central bank under the leadership of Fed Chair Jerome Powell was serious about defending its 2% inflation target, that belief only formed over time and after the officials began raising the policy interest rate in March 2022 and accelerated the rate hikes over that summer, the researchers found.


"Forecasters and markets were highly uncertain about the monetary policy rule prior to 'liftoff' and learned about it from the Fed's rate hikes," economists Michael Bauer from the San Francisco Fed, Carolin Pflueger from the University of Chicago, and Adi Sunderam from the Harvard Business School, found in their research. "Substantial rate hikes were apparently necessary for perceptions to shift. ... The public did not fully understand the Fed's strategy and policy rule prior to liftoff."


The research serves as a warning of sorts against central bankers putting too much weight on the power of "talk therapy" — or the ability to influence economic outcomes with words and promises alone.


Earning public trust


The Fed in recent years has been characterized by a surfeit of speeches and public comments by its officials, whether by the head of the central bank, other members of its presidentially appointed Board of Governors, or its 12 regional bank presidents, under the notion that more transparency is good for public accountability and makes policy more effective.


Fed officials in the recent inflation battle often noted that public belief in their commitment to the inflation target would help on its own to lower the pace of price increases, shorten the time it took for tighter monetary policy to have an impact, and lower inflation with less damage to the job market and other aspects of the "real" economy.


The researchers found, however, that while the Fed under Powell eventually earned the benefit of public trust, it also wasn't a given.


The research used survey data to quantify how professional forecasters perceived the Fed would respond to higher inflation and found that even as prices began rising in 2021 the expected Fed response to inflation was near zero.


While that could have been attributed to several factors, including a belief that inflation would ease on its own, the researchers concluded it was because forecasters weren't sure how the central bank would react.


After the first rate increase in March of 2022, however, perceptions began to shift, with forecasters eventually expecting the Fed to respond on an almost one-for-one basis to any rise in inflation.


The change in perceptions coincided with policymakers shifting from the initial quarter-percentage-point move to the first of four 75-basis-point hikes in June 2022, and with a stern speech by Powell at that year's Jackson Hole conference that reaffirmed his intent to defend the inflation target despite the economic pain it might cause.


As market perceptions about the Fed's sensitivity to inflation increased, "interest rates became significantly more sensitive to inflation data surprises," the research found, adding that "the increase in the perceived inflation response likely aided the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy and improved the Fed's inflation-unemployment tradeoff."


For future policymakers, the researchers said, the conclusion is clear: Actions speak louder than words.


"Policy rate actions contribute to, and may even be necessary for, the effectiveness of communication, particularly when uncertainty about the monetary policy framework is high," they found, suggesting the Fed's quarterly Summary of Economic Projections could be changed to make the central bank's "reaction function" more explicit. "A timely policy rate response to inflation matters not only for influencing immediate financial conditions, but also for signaling that policymakers are serious."

## Thoughts on a new image for the fediverse

<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>This <a href="https://symbol.fediverse.info/">proposed image for the fediverse</a> is good; I like it a lot.</p><p>But I don't know that the combative language on this site is helpful. The Meta iconography isn't right, I agree, but there's something off about calling them “a large corporation that is joining in as late” (sic).</p><p>For one thing, Meta is early; for another, it seems to me that we want companies to participate? I don’t think seeking ideological purity is useful (and run the risks of the movement shooting itself in the foot).</p><p>Whatever you think about Meta’s goals for participating, I do also think Meta’s presence gives the network a sort of legitimacy that it was otherwise struggling to achieve. That’s a net benefit: we must grow the network.</p><p>I also agree with <a href="https://www.manton.org/2024/08/24/i-like-the.html">the point</a>, made by Chris Messina, Manton Reece and others, that the right phrase is <em>the social web</em>, not the fediverse.

## Babe Ruth's 'called shot' jersey could auction for up to $30M

date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA

DALLAS, Texas — Nearly a century after Babe Ruth called his shot during the 1932 World Series, the jersey worn by the New York Yankees slugger when he hit the home run to center field could sell at auction for as much as $30 million.


Heritage Auctions is offering up the jersey Saturday night in Dallas.


Ruth's famed, debated and often imitated “called shot” came as the Yankees and Chicago Cubs faced off in Game 3 of the World Series at Chicago's Wrigley Field on October 1, 1932. In the fifth inning, Ruth made a pointing gesture while at bat and then hit a home run off Cubs pitcher Charlie Root.


The Yankees won the game 7-5 and swept the Cubs the next day to win the series.


That was Ruth's last World Series, and the “called shot” was his last home run in a World Series, said Mike Provenzale, the production manager for Heritage’s sports department.


“When you can tie an item like that to an important figure and their most important moment, that’s what collectors are really looking for,” Provenzale said.


Heritage said Ruth gave the road jersey to one of his golfing buddies in Florida around 1940 and it remained in that family for decades. Then, in the early 1990s, that man's daughter sold it to a collector. It was then sold at auction in 2005 for $940,000, and that buyer consigned it to Heritage this year.


In 2019, one of Ruth's road jerseys dating to 1928-30 sold for $5.64 million in an auction conducted at Yankee Stadium. That jersey was part of a collection of items that Ruth’s family had put up for sale.

## Canadian rail arbitration hearing ends without decision; strike looms

date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA

TORONTO — A workers’ union Friday threatened a strike at one of Canada’s two major freight railroads, only hours after the company’s trains restarted following a potentially devastating stoppage. A government-ordered arbitration hearing wrapped up without a decision, and Canadian National trains were expected to keep moving at least through Monday morning.


CN and Canadian Pacific Kansas City Ltd. locked out their workers Thursday when negotiations over a new labor contract reached a deadline without an agreement. That resulted in a near total shutdown of freight rail in the country for more than a day, until Canadian National resumed its service Friday morning. Trains operated by CPKC remain parked, and its workers, who had already been on strike since Thursday, stayed on the picket line Friday.


The government forced the companies and the union, Teamsters Canada Rail Conference, into arbitration overseen by the Canada Industrial Relations Board — an order the union is challenging. Friday's nine-hour hearing ended with no order from the board.


The union filed a 72-hour strike notice against CN on Friday morning shortly after it announced that it planned to challenge the arbitration order, union spokesperson Marc-Andre Gauthier said.


If the board orders the union back to work, “the TCRC will lawfully abide by the decision, but will undertake steps to challenge to the fullest extent," the Teamsters said in a statement. “Unfortunately, this will not provide immediate relief, but the Union is prepared to appeal to federal court if necessary.”


Canadian National, which has about 6,500 workers involved in the dispute, said the impact of the strike notice will depend on the timing of the Canada Industrial Relations Board's decision. “It is in the national interest of Canada that the CIRB rule quickly, before even more harm is caused,” the railroad said in a written statement. CPKC has about 3,000 engineers, conductors and dispatchers involved.


Perrin Beatty, president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said the union's latest actions "will prolong the damage to our economy and jeopardize the wellbeing and livelihoods of Canadians, including union and nonunion workers across multiple industries.”


Labor Minister Steven MacKinnon announced the decision to force the parties into binding arbitration Thursday afternoon, more than 16 hours after the lockout shut down the railroads, saying the economic risk was too great to allow them to continue. The government had declined to order arbitration two weeks ago. MacKinnon said he had hoped that negotiations between the companies and the union on a new contract would succeed.


“This is not about disobeying the minister’s order. It’s about exercising our right,” Teamsters Canada President Francois Laporte said Friday in announcing the strike. “We will exercise our right within the legal framework."


Canadian National trains had begun rolling at 7 a.m. across Canada, said CN spokesperson Jonathan Abecassis. The development initially appeared to at least partially end a work stoppage that threatened to wreak havoc on the economies of Canada and the United States. Both countries, across all industries, rely on railroads to deliver their raw materials and finished products.


“While CN is focused on its recovery plan and powering the economy, Teamsters are focused on getting back to the picket line and holding the North American economy hostage to their demands,” Abecassis said following the union’s strike notice.


Getting even one of the railroads running again is a relief for businesses. In most past rail labor disputes, only one of the Canadian railroads stopped and the economy was able to weather that disruption.


The negotiations that began last year are hung up on issues around the way workers are scheduled and contract rules designed to prevent fatigue. The railroads had proposed shifting away from the current system that pays workers based on the number of miles they travel, to a system based on the hours they work. The railroads said the switch would make it easier to provide predictable schedules. But the union resisted because it feared the proposed changes would erode hard-fought protections against fatigue and jeopardize safety.


In Canada, another issue at CN is the railroad's intention to expand a system that allows it to temporarily relocate workers to other parts of its network when it's short on employees in a certain region.


Regarding wages, the railroads said they both offered raises in line with other recent deals in the industry for what are already well-paying jobs. Canadian National has said its engineers make about $150,000 and conductors earn roughly $121,000 for working 160 days a year, although some of their time off is spent stuck at hotels on the road between train trips while getting required rest. CPKC says its pay is comparable.


Nearly all of Canada’s freight handled by rail — worth more than $730 million a day and adding up to more than 375 million tons of freight last year — stopped Thursday along with rail shipments crossing the U.S. border.


About 30,000 commuters in Canada were also affected because their trains use CPKC’s lines. CPKC and CN’s trains continued operating in the U.S. and Mexico during the lockout.


Billions of dollars of goods move between Canada and the U.S. via rail each month, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.


“There are a lot of goods and services shipped across borders," Sean O’Brien, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said at a rally in Calgary, Alberta, on Friday. "If this company chooses to continue its bad behavior, then it is going to have an impact. ... They’ve got a lot of decisions they need to make. And they need to make the most important decision: Reward these workers with what they’ve earned and don’t try to diminish safety just so they need to feed their bottom lines.”

## Hone approaches Hawaii; Big Island under tropical storm warning

date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA

HONOLULU, HAWAII — Tropical Storm Hone was approaching the southern edges of Hawaii on Saturday with gusts of wind and heavy rain, potentially inflicting flooding and wind damage on the Big Island over the weekend and raising the risk of wildfires on the drier sides of the islands.


The National Weather Service has issued a tropical storm warning for Hawaii County, which includes all of the Big Island, and a red flag warning for the leeward sides of all islands.


Hone, which means “sweet and soft” in Hawaiian, had top winds of 105 kilometers per hour (65 miles per hour) early Saturday. It will likely strengthen into a Category 1 hurricane as it passes near or south of the Big Island from Saturday night into early Sunday, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami.


The Hawaii Tourism Authority told travelers it's still safe to come to the islands but recommended that people postpone outdoor activities.


“We are not advising visitors to cancel their trips,” the agency said in a news release.


Hone was centered 465 kilometers (290 miles) east-southeast of Hilo and 805 kilometers (500 miles) east-southeast of Honolulu early Saturday.


The eastern and southeastern parts of the Big Island could get 11 to 25 centimeters (5 to 10 inches) of rain. The island could get sustained winds of 32 to 64 kph (20 to 40 mph) and gusts near 97 kph (60 mph).


The dry air north of the storm will spread arid conditions across the archipelago on Saturday, combining with strong winds to raise wildfire risks. Most of the state is already abnormally dry or in drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.


The weather service's red flag warning will be in effect from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday. It issues the alert when warm temperatures, very low humidity and stronger winds combine to raise fire dangers. Winds are expected to be strongest where they blow downslope from higher terrain, over headlands and through passes, the hurricane center advised.


The situation recalls last year's deadly wildfires on Maui, which were fueled by hurricane-force winds. But Hone's wildfire risks are lower, said Laura Farris, a weather service meteorologist in Honolulu.


The August 8, 2023, blaze that torched the historic town of Lahaina caused the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century. Powerful winds whipped up in part by a hurricane passing to Hawaii's south helped fuel the flames that killed 102 people. Dry, overgrown grasses and drought helped spread the fire.


The state's two power companies, Hawaiian Electric and the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative, said they would be monitoring conditions this weekend and ready to shut off power if necessary to reduce the chance that live, damaged powerlines could start fires.


The cause of the Lahaina blaze is still under investigation, but it’s possible it was ignited by bare electrical wire and leaning power poles toppled by the strong winds.


Moving westward across the Pacific behind Hone was Category 2 Hurricane Gilma, but it was expected to weaken over cooler waters as it encounters drier air in coming days and was forecast to become a tropical depression by Wednesday. Gilma may bring rain to Hawaii, but it's not clear how much, Farris said.

## They don’t make ’em like that any more: Borland Turbo Pascal 7

date: 2024-08-24, from: OS News

All, in all, It was much easier to program for Windows using Turbo Pascal 7 than with anything else. Not only did it provide a programming model that matched the way the Windows user interface worked, the application itself had a Windows graphical interface – many Windows programming tools at that time actually ran under MSDOS, and were entirely text-based. TP 7 also had fully-graphical tools for designing the user interface elements, like menus and icons. Laying out a menu using a definition file with an obscure format, using Windows Notepad, was never an agreeable experience. Microsoft did produce graphical tools for this kind of operation, but Turbo Pascal combined them into a seamless IDE. All I had to do to build and run my programs was to hit the F7 key. I could even set breakpoints for the debugger, just by clicking a line of code. As I said, common enough today, but revolutionary for early Windows programming. ↫ Kevin Boone Even as a mere child who didn&#8217;t even know what programming was, I was aware of Turbo Pascal. It was a name that you just encountered all over the place as a DOS and Windows 3.x user, even if you didn&#8217;t know what it was. The author of this article, Kevin Boone, even claims Turbo Pascal &#8220;contributed to the widespread uptake, and eventual domination, of Microsoft Windows on desktop PCs&#8221;, which is not something I can verify because I was far too young, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it holds water. This article made me wonder if Pascal is easy to learn, and if someone wanting to learn programming can do worse than start with a Windows 3.x virtual machine and Turbo Pascal. Sure, it&#8217;s probably not very relevant today, but it might serve as a good, solid base to work from? I have no idea.

## Ethernet history deepdive: why do we have different frame types?

date: 2024-08-24, from: OS News

The history of Ethernet is fascinating. The reason why we have three different frame types is that DIX used the Ethernet II frame that is prevalent today, while IEEE intended to use a different frame format that could be used for different MAC layers, such as token bus, token ring, FDDI, and so on. The IEEE were also inspired by HDLC, and modeled their frame header more in alignment with the OSI reference model that had the concept of SAPs. When they discovered that the number of available SAPs weren’t enough, they made an addition to the 802 standard to support SNAP frames. In networks today, Ethernet II is dominant, but some control protocols may use LLC and/or SNAP frames. ↫ Daniel Dib I just smiled and nodded.

## P&B: Robert Kingett

date: 2024-08-24, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>This is the 52nd edition of <em>People and Blogs</em>, the series where I ask interesting people to talk about themselves and their blogs. Today we have Robert Kingett and his blog, <a href="https://robertkingett.com">robertkingett.com</a></p>
<p>To follow this series <a href="https://peopleandblogs.com">subscribe to the newsletter</a>. A new interview will land in your inbox every Friday. Not a fan of newsletters? No problem! You can read the interviews here on the blog or you can subscribe to the <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/feed">RSS feed</a>.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</h2>
<p>I'm a totally blind, gay, writer of fiction and nonfiction. I work in the audio description space as a writer and Blind Quality Control specialist/editor, but I also write fiction podcast scripts as well as novellas and novels. I publish books, and I'm a vibrant advocate for digital accessibility with regards to blind access.</p>
<p>My main love is writing. I love writing fiction stories because I believe it's the best kind of education.</p>
<p>As for the types of fiction I write, I write romance. Diverse romance, specifically. I've dabbled in erotica, but my work leans more towards the romance side of the coin with not a lot of smut. I do write about people like me, awkward, but empathetic people and their love journeys. Others have also said I'm a great humor writer, but I don't consider myself gut busting funny, but others would disagree!</p>
<p>Lastly, I write screenplays and TV show seasons, but my main writing love has always been writing romance books and novellas and fiction podcast scripts.</p>
<p>I'm also an accessibility consultant. Trust me, I don't love the accessibility consulting, but I'm passionate about accessibility and accessible design because it's how I can access the web.</p>
<p>As for my hobbies? I read a lot of books, consume a lot of fiction podcasts, and eat a lot of cookies. I'm a digital nomad so I work entirely remotely.</p>
<h2>What's the story behind your blog?</h2>
<p>I knew that I always wanted my own website. I didn't want to be beholden to any tech corporation hosting my content, let alone censor me because people find sex gross but somehow find hateful opinions to be just fine and dandy. My blog is all over the place. Blind readers will get tutorials on how to use something with a screen reader. Publishing people will get thoughts and opinions about disability representation in the industry and the media published by various publishers. Other people will find snapshots of experiences and how I feel about them. My blog isn't one thing. It's a mix mash of things.</p>
<p>I always wanted a space of my own to just dump thoughts and stories and otherwise onto the internet without having a corporation control what I can say or who sees it. With an RSS feed, my writings aren't controlled by an algorithm or someone paying to drown out my post with their latest sponsored content.</p>
<p>I didn't like where WordPress was headed with their Gutenberg editor at all, so I went looking for a static site generator I could use. I know how to read code, and I know how to write in some internet languages, but I really didn't want to host my own site. I wanted to pay someone to host my stuff but also let me to exact control sometimes. Also, I needed a platform that was going to be screen reader accessible from the beginning. Very few publishing platforms are screen reader accessible, so my options are limited, but I didn't want to do Micro Blogging. I like writing long content because lengthy writing lends itself to more introspection and thought.</p>
<p>I knew I didn't want to narrow down my blog to a particular theme. I knew it was going to be me. It was going to be a platform to promote my work, for me to tell stories, and for me to talk to other people. I finally found a web host that was willing to host my blog for a fee.</p>
<h2>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</h2>
<p>If I am doing a nonfiction piece, I gather up all links and references in a text editor and just keep a running list of references and links until I'm done with that post. I write to old boy bands like Simple Plan and similar. I also write to environmental sounds, or I have a playlist of mood songs and use that when I want to really lean into a fiction scene. When I write novels, I write all the best/most interesting scenes first, then I go back and write what happens before and after the most interesting scenes. Same for screenplays and fiction podcast scripts.</p>
<h2>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</h2>
<p>I always write at a desk with a full keyboard. I never write on my phone unless I have a Bluetooth keyboard with me. If I write in public, I always people watch and eavesdrop on random conversations because that's fantastic ways to study people and how they interact with others. I write a lot in libraries because I don't have to buy anything, and I can reserve rooms all day if I want to write away from home, all for free.</p>
<h2>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</h2>
<p>The blog is currently a CMS called ClassicPress hosted by Project Army. As for how I write, if I write in HTML or similar, I then write in Markdown or a similar fashion in a plain text editor. I write all my novels in plain text and or Markdown then convert them later. I write all my screenplays and fiction podcast scripts in Fountain. Those are all plain text solutions. After I'm all done, I convert the plain text screenplay or novel into a formatted book or formatted screenplay using open-source tools like Pandoc.</p>
<h2>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</h2>
<p>If I had to start over, I’d go with a static site generator first because it will have better longevity than a CMS database. I wouldn't change anything else. The title, content, anything.</p>
<h2>Financial question since the Web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost, or does it generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetizing personal blogs?</h2>
<p>I pay about $200 biannually for my blog to be hosted. I rely entirely on donations and a shared funding model where people financially sponsor my hosts and otherwise to keep me online. I'm fully reader supported, and the blog doesn’t make a profit. I'm not intending to sell people’s data or have ads on my blog. That's just a poor reader experience. I often joke that if you want to take me offline, just stop donating to me, because that will be the day I finally just let the blog go.</p>
<h2>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</h2>
<p>I highly recommend the podcast/blog Reid my Mind radio. I also think you should check out Jonathan Mosen blog. I listen to more podcasts than I read any particular blog, which is ironic because I have over 100 RSS feeds, but I don't have any particular blog recommendations. I do recommend people read some fanfiction on Archive of Our Own, though!</p>
<h2>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</h2>
<p>Because I'm such a fiction podcast guru, I’d highly recommend checking out the Fiction Podcast the Bright Sessions or the Two Princes. I’d also suggest the best place, I think, to find fiction podcasts is <a href="https://www.theend.fyi/">https://www.theend.fyi/</a> but I also recommend watching any movie with audio description enabled and not looking at the screen. You can find movies with audio description at <a href="https://adp.acb.org/masterad.html">https://adp.acb.org/masterad.html</a></p>

## North Korea condemns new US nuclear strategic plan report

date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA

Seoul, South Korea — North Korea vowed Saturday to advance its nuclear capabilities, reacting to a report that the United States had revised its own nuclear strategic plan.


The country will "bolster up its strategic strength in every way to control and eliminate all sorts of security challenges that may result from Washington's revised plan," the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.


The New York Times reported this week that a U.S. plan approved by President Joe Biden in March was to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea.


The highly classified plan for the first time reorients Washington's deterrent strategy to focus on China's rapid expansion in its nuclear arsenal, the Times said.


KCNA said North Korea's foreign ministry "expresses serious concern over and bitterly denounces and rejects the behavior of the U.S."


It added North Korea vowed to push forward the building of nuclear force sufficient and reliable enough to firmly defend its sovereignty.


Pyongyang and Moscow have been allies since North Korea's founding after World War II and have drawn even closer since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.


The United States and Seoul have accused North Korea of providing ammunition and missiles to Russia for its war in Ukraine.


Pyongyang, which has declared itself an "irreversible" nuclear weapons power, has described allegations of supplying weapons to Russia as "absurd."


However, it did thank Russia for using its United Nations veto in March to effectively end monitoring of sanctions violations just as UN experts were starting to probe alleged arms transfers.


China, also a key ally of North Korea, presents itself as a neutral party in Russia's offensive on Ukraine and says it is not sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the United States and other Western nations.


But it is a close political and economic ally of Russia, and NATO members have branded Beijing a "decisive enabler" of the war.


Moscow has looked to Beijing as an economic lifeline since the Ukraine conflict began, with the two boosting trade to record highs as Russia faces heavy sanctions from the West.

## Archaeologists in Virginia find colonial-era garden, clues about slaves who tended it

date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA

williamsburg, virginia — Archaeologists in Virginia are uncovering one of colonial America's most lavish displays of opulence: an ornamental garden where a wealthy politician and enslaved gardeners grew exotic plants from around the world. 


Such plots dotted Britain's colonies and served as status symbols for the elite. They were the 18th-century equivalent of buying a Lamborghini. 


The garden in Williamsburg belonged to John Custis IV, a tobacco plantation owner who served in Virginia's colonial legislature. He is perhaps best known as the first father-in-law of Martha Washington. She married future U.S. President George Washington after Custis' son Daniel died. 


Historians also have been intrigued by the elder Custis' botanical adventures, which were well-documented in letters and later in books. And yet this excavation is as much about the people who cultivated the land as it is about Custis. 


"The garden may have been Custis' vision, but he wasn't the one doing the work," said Jack Gary, executive director of archaeology at Colonial Williamsburg, a living history museum that now owns the property. "Everything we see in the ground that's related to the garden is the work of enslaved gardeners, many of whom must have been very skilled." 


Posts, paths


Archaeologists have pulled up fence posts that were 3 feet (1 meter) thick and carved from red cedar. Gravel paths were uncovered, including a large central walkway. Stains in the soil show where plants grew in rows. 


The dig also has unearthed a pierced coin that was typically worn as a good-luck charm by young African Americans. Workers have also found the shards of an earthenware chamber pot, or portable toilet, that likely was used by people who were enslaved. 


Animals appear to have been intentionally buried under some fence posts. They included two chickens with their heads removed, as well as a single cow's foot. A snake without a skull was found in a shallow hole that had likely contained a plant. 


"We have to wonder if we're seeing traditions that are non-European," Gary said. "Are they West African traditions? We need to do more research. But it's features like those that make us continue to try and understand the enslaved people who were in this space." 




The museum tells the story of Virginia's colonial capital through interpreters and restored buildings on 300 acres (120 hectares), which include parts of the original city. Founded in 1926, the museum did not start telling stories about Black Americans until 1979, even though more than half of the 2,000 people who lived there were Black, the majority enslaved. 


In recent years, the museum has boosted efforts to tell a more complete story, while trying to attract more Black visitors. It plans to reconstruct one of the nation's oldest Black churches and is restoring what is believed to be the country's oldest surviving schoolhouse for Black children. 


There also are plans to re-create Custis' Williamsburg home and garden, known then as Custis Square. Unlike some historic gardens, the restoration will be done without the benefit of surviving maps or diagrams, relying instead on what Gary described as the most detailed landscape archaeology effort in the museum's history. 


The garden disappeared after Custis' death in 1749. But the dig has determined it was about two-thirds the size of a football field, while descriptions from the time refer to lead statues of Greek gods and topiaries trimmed into balls and pyramids. 


Correspondence with Briton


The garden's legacy has lived on through Custis' correspondence with British botanist Peter Collinson, who traded plants with other horticulturalists around the globe. From 1734 to 1746, Custis and Collinson exchanged seeds and letters via merchant ships crossing the Atlantic. 


The men possibly introduced new plants to their respective communities, said Eve Otmar, Colonial Williamsburg's master of historic gardening. For instance, Custis is believed to have made one of Williamsburg's earliest written mentions of growing tomatoes, known then as "apples of love" and native to Mexico and Central and South America. 


Custis' gardeners also planted strawberries, pistachios and almonds, among 100 other imported plants. It's not always clear from his letters which were successful in the Virginia climate. A recent pollen analysis of the soil indicates the past presence of stone fruits, such as peaches and cherries, which weren't a big surprise. 


The garden existed at a time when European empires and slavery were still expanding. Botanical gardens often were used for discovering new cash crops that could enrich colonial powers. 


But Custis' garden was primarily about showing off his wealth. A study of the area's topography placed his garden in direct view of Williamsburg's only church house at the time. Everyone would have seen the garden's fence, but few were invited inside. 


Exotic lily


Custis delighted his guests with the likes of the crown imperial lily, which was native to the Middle East and parts of Asia, and boasted clusters of drooping, bell-shaped flowers. 


"In the 18th century, those were unusual things," Otmar said. "Only certain classes of people got to experience that. A wealthy person today — they buy a Lamborghini." 


The museum is still trying to learn more about the people who worked in the garden. 


Crystal Castleberry, Colonial Williamsburg's public archaeologist, has met with descendants of the more than 200 people who were enslaved by the Custis family on his various plantations. But there is too little information in surviving documents to determine if an ancestor lived and worked at Custis Square. 


Two people, named Cornelia and Beck, were listed as property with the Williamsburg estate after Daniel Custis died in 1757. But their names prompt only more questions about who they were and what happened to them. 


"Are they related to one another?" Castleberry asked. "Do they fear being split up or sold? Or are they going to be reunited with loved ones on other properties?"

## Florida quietly removes LGBTQ+ travel info from state website

date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA

TALLAHASSEE, Fla.  — Key West, Fort Lauderdale, Wilton Manors and St. Petersburg are among several Florida cities that have long been top U.S. destinations for LGBTQ tourists. So it came as a surprise this week when travelers learned that Florida's tourism marketing agency quietly removed the "LGBTQ Travel" section from its website sometime in the past few months.


Business owners who cater to Florida's LGBTQ tourists said Wednesday that it marked the latest attempt by officials in the state to erase the LGBTQ community. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis previously championed a bill to forbid classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity, and supported a ban on gender-affirming care for minors, as well as a law meant to keep children out of drag shows.


"It's just disgusting to see this," said Keith Blackburn, who heads the Greater Fort Lauderdale LGBT Chamber of Commerce. "They seem to want to erase us."


The change to Visit Florida's website was first reported by NBC News, which noted a search query still pulls up some listings for LGBTQ-friendly places despite the elimination of the section.


John Lai, who chairs Visit Florida's board, didn't respond to an email seeking comment Tuesday. Dana Young, Visit Florida's CEO and president, didn't respond to a voicemail message Wednesday, and neither did the agency's public relations director.


Visit Florida is a public-private partnership between the state of Florida and the state's tourism industry. The state contributes about $50 million each year to the quasi-public agency from two tourism and economic development funds.


Florida is one of the most popular states in the U.S. for tourists, and tourism is one of its biggest industries. Nearly 141 million tourists visited Florida in 2023, with out-of-state visitors contributing more than $102 billion to Florida's economy.


Before the change, the LGBTQ section on Visit Florida's website had read, "There's a sense of freedom to Florida's beaches, the warm weather and the myriad activities — a draw for people of all orientations, but especially appealing to a gay community looking for a sense of belonging and acceptance."


Blackburn said the change and other anti-LGBTQ policies out of Tallahassee make it more difficult for him to promote South Florida tourism since he encounters prospective travelers or travel promoters who say they don't want to do business in the state.


Last year, for instance, several civil rights groups issued a travel advisory for Florida, saying that policies championed by DeSantis and Florida lawmakers are "openly hostile toward African Americans, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals."


But visitors should also understand that many Florida cities are extremely inclusive, with gay elected officials and LGBTQ-owned businesses, and they don't reflect the policies coming from state government, Blackburn added.


"It's difficult when these kinds of stories come out, and the state does these things, and we hear people calling for a boycott," Blackburn said. "On one level, it's embarrassing to have to explain why people should come to South Florida and our destination when the state is doing these things."

## Sidelined at the DNC, pro-Palestinian Democrats still see progress

date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA

Chicago — Hundreds of pro-Palestinian delegates were sidelined at the Democratic National Convention that ended with Vice President Kamala Harris reaffirming her support for Israel.


"The people of Israel must never again face the horror that a terrorist organization called Hamas caused on October 7," she said in her speech accepting the party’s presidential nomination Thursday evening.


As anti-war protesters filled the streets throughout the week, 270 pro-Palestinian Democrats calling themselves "cease-fire delegates" signed a petition demanding Harris, if she’s elected, enact an arms embargo on Israel.


The unheeded petition was pushed by leaders of the "Uncommitted" movement, which garnered hundreds of thousands of votes in Democratic primaries across the nation.


These delegates staged a sit-in outside Chicago’s United Center, the convention’s venue, to protest the Democratic National Committee, who denied a speaking request for Tanya Haj-Hassan, a pediatric doctor who treats wounded children in Gaza.


The DNC, according to Uncommitted National Movement spokesperson Layla Elabed, didn’t want Harris to be "overshadowed."


Asked by VOA for a reaction to Elabed’s claim, the Harris campaign said, "There have been a number of speakers who have spoken about the war in Gaza and the need to secure a cease-fire and hostage deal."


Uncommitted delegates


Elabed spoke to VOA on behalf of the 30 "Uncommitted" delegates who voted present in the nomination roll call. That’s less than 1% of the roughly 4,700 delegates who voted for Harris.


The pro-Palestinian group, however, was given a speaking opportunity Monday in a panel event outside of the convention.


Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a Muslim sympathetic to the Palestinian cause who spoke on the panel, was given time at the convention main stage on Wednesday. However, he did not mention Gaza in his speech.


The war in Gaza is "not the topic that I would decide" to speak about, Ellison told VOA before his speech, indicating that pragmatism is key to affect change within the party.


"I'm not one of those people who believe that we vote for perfection. What we vote for is conversation," he said.


Party platform supports Israel


As the convention kicked off, Democrats voted to adopt the party’s platform that recommitted support for Israel, a cease-fire for hostage release deal and the two-state solution.


Pro-Palestinian delegates tried to include language backing enforcement of laws that ban giving military aid to individuals or security forces that commit gross violations of human rights.


"What we are asking is that our tax dollars not be used to kill men, women and children. This is not a controversial demand and is actually more aligned with our Democratic values," Elabed said.


Compared to Biden, Harris appears to offer more sympathy for Palestinian suffering, repeating Thursday of the "devastating" situation in Gaza over the past 10 months."


"So many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, over and over again," she said in her convention speech. "The scale of suffering is heartbreaking."


But policy-wise she signaled continuity from the current administration.


"President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination," she said in her speech to thunderous applause.


Harris’ current and former aides say her Israel policy is unlikely to diverge from President Joe Biden. Halie Soifer, national security adviser to Harris while she was in the Senate, said that the vice president has always been a "strong supporter of the U.S.-Israel relationship," while upholding humanitarian values.


"She does not want to see the suffering of innocent civilians, nor do the vast majority of Americans and Jewish Americans," said Soifer, who is now CEO of Jewish Democratic Council of America.


"We don't have to view it through binary lens," she told VOA. "We support both."


Not discouraged


Uncommitted delegates say they’re not discouraged.


Inga Gibson, a delegate from Hawaii, a state where seven out of 31 delegates are uncommitted, said she has made "tremendous progress" with her fellow delegates.


"I found that a lot of people are really with us on this issue, but they don't know where to begin or how to get involved," she told VOA.


She and other uncommitted delegates gave out keffiyehs, "Democrats for Gaza" flyers and "No More Bombs" pins. The pro-Palestinian symbols are emblematic of a key area of disagreement among Democrats – how much support to give to Israel.


Pro-Israel delegates say it should not create division within the party.


"We can all do better to try to understand the complications of the conflict," Andrew Lachman, a delegate from California told VOA. "We're all concerned about the civilians of Gaza, but we're also concerned about the people of Israel and their safety and security."


Polls show an increasing number of Americans want their leaders to reduce support for Israel. Some say Harris missed an opportunity.


As a former prosecutor, Harris can and should strictly enforce laws and suspend weapons even to allies who violate international or U.S. law, said Nancy Okail, president and CEO of the Center for International Policy, a left-leaning think tank.


"She could make clear this doesn’t just apply to their misuse by Israel to cause disproportionate civilian harm in Gaza, but to their misuse by Netanyahu’s extremist government to dispossess and abuse Palestinians in the occupied West Bank," she told VOA.


Turning protest into agenda


Scholars of social movements say it takes time and work to turn protests into a political agenda. Elisabeth Clemens, a sociologist from the University of Chicago, said that includes building coalitions, negotiating and compromising.


"Finding a way forward that almost never gets all the way to where the protesters hoped it would get but is nevertheless an important change," she told VOA.


And on an issue as complicated as the Middle East peace process, there are different pressures exerted on multiple sides.


"American domestic politics only garners a slice of that," she said.


Elabed said they’re in for the long game.


"Our strategy is not to abandon the Democratic Party, but to essentially revolutionize the Democratic Party and listen to its core base."


For now, the vice president is their best bet.


"I don’t care what you think, you need to win to have power," Ellison said. "Harris, the numbers are up everywhere. The chances for success are higher."

## Vibe Check №34

date: 2024-08-24, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>The temperatures soared over 100ºF and the yard is dead and everything smells roasted. But the ten day forecast shows a ten degree dip and that is cause for celebration. Another school year has started. My son has started middle school and my daughter is now in third grade. It’s shocking how fast life goes. And on the workfront, the pace is picking up now that everyone has come back from summer vacation.</p>
<p>A lot has transpired since the previous vibe check (vacations, new pets, rock shows). To start it off, my family escaped the heat and went to San Diego (as is the custom) for one good week and one awful week…</p>
<h2>San Diego: The First Good Week</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/sandiego.jpg" alt="Left: a pink beach drink. Right a dark sunset over Mission Bay San Diego" /></p>
<p>We flew out to Phoenix to join up with my wife’s family and caravan out to San Diego. We had a family dinner the night before and got to see my one year old grandnephew for the first time in a long while. He’s a sweet kid but does not want his Granduncle Dave holding him yet.</p>
<p>The next day we loaded up the beach gear and drove to a resort in Mission Beach in San Diego for a four day stay. We had a great time with my wife’s family letting the cousins run loose while grown-ups played tennis, pickleball, and I played my annual round of golf with my male in-laws. After four days of big family time we scooted up to Encinitas to stay for two nights with our Austin friends whose summer rental had a guest house.</p>
<p>Encinitas was super charming. We stayed near <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g32355-d12186525-Reviews-Beacon_s_Beach-Encinitas_California.html">Beacons Beach</a> which is one of those cool beaches at the bottom of a cliffside. We beached pretty hard. My daughter and her oldest bestie pranced up and down the shoreline for hours and she even learned to surf. The contrast between Mission and Encinitas couldn’t be more stark. The trip could have ended there and would have been one of the best vacations in the books. But we weren’t done! We planned to extend the trip with a one-week rental in Mission Bay.</p>
<h2>San Diego: The Second Awful Week</h2>
<p>The minute we checked into our beachside rental the whole vibe shifted. From tranquil Encinitas to getting blasted with the sounds (and smells) of Mission Beach. Honking, motorcycles, bottles clanking, fighting, garbage trucks, neighbors blasting bad music, and smells drifting up from the alleyway. It felt like going from a yoga retreat to a frat house. Then it got worse. That night our daughter said she didn’t feel well and the next day my wife started going downhill.</p>
<p>A week of beach fun turned into spending thousands of dollars to be sick inside a beach-adjacent summer rental watching SpongeBob Squarepants on repeat. After three urgent care visits over two days the sick members of our party had the required antibiotics to start feeling better. The next day, we went home.</p>
<p>And –as if it couldn’t get any better– I got COVID on the plane ride back. Ughck.</p>
<h2>We adopted two new pups</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/dogs.jpg" alt="One black dog with one brown eye and one blue eye and a black and white dog with pointy ears and two blue eyes, both staring at the camera" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Laneige (aka “Laney”) - A black lab mix with one brown eye and one blue eye. She’s an attention thief who is not shy about demanding pets.</li>
<li>Rosebud - A lab mix with expressive pointy ears and two blue eyes (some heeler in there?). She’s the more anxious of the two, but once befriended will roll over for belly rubs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our kids have been asking for a new dog for over a year. Every day this summer I’d step into the house and my daughter would spin a laptop around to show me the new dogs she found on <a href="https://www.austinpetsalive.org/">the Austin Pets Alive! website</a>. She even wrote a song to try to convince me to get a dog. 🥺 They were dead set on a pup named “Laneige” (named by the shelter after a Korean lip balm).</p>
<p>After dropping the kids off at grandma’s house for a long weekend, we set our plan into action: adopt a dog and surprise the kids. But our plans changed when the shelter brought out Laneige’s sister Rosebud (also named after a lip balm) to our meet and greet. Her pointy ears and blue eyes were too cute. We tend to play it more conservative when it comes to big life choices but we decided to go full stupid for once and surprise the kids with not one dog, but two dogs!</p>
<p>Names may change and we daily ask ourselves “Did we overdo it?” but generally we’re happy with the new additions.</p>
<h2>Frostapalooza</h2>

<p>A year ago Brad Frost called my wife and I to share a wild idea for his 40th birthday party: get all his musician friends from all over the world together on one stage for one night of rocking out. Over the course of the next year we picked songs, learned parts, recorded tracks, hoping –but never knowing– how it would all turn out when we assembled in Pittsburgh for one night of rock.</p>
<p>It. Was. Phenomenal.</p>
<p>Nothing could have prepared me for the blast from the five piece horn section. It sounded perfect. It felt big. Dozens of people on stage playing together for the first time, but you wouldn’t know it. Music –good music– filling the halls of an old church. I’m a foot away from a bass guitar amp but I can’t hear the bass because there’s so much music happening. In the crowd I see people listening to my wife sing –they’re singing along– and it takes me back to when I first heard her sing at a karaoke bar in Los Angeles when I fell in love with her.</p>

<p>Outside the main event, it felt good to put kindling on some friendships. I got to see <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/">Chris</a>, which is always pleasant to see the one person I’m guaranteed to have an hour long conversation every week. <a href="https://www.zachmeyer.com/">Zach</a> &amp; Danh (my co-hosts from <a href="https://asidequest.simplecast.com/">Aside Quest</a>) flew up on the same flight. But I got to see and chat with new and old friends as well; <a href="https://ianfrostweather.com/">Ian</a>, <a href="https://www.dandenney.com/">Dan</a>, <a href="https://bencallahan.com/">Ben</a>, <a href="https://www.hawksworx.com/about">Phil</a>, <a href="https://www.mikeaparicio.com/">Mike</a>, <a href="https://www.jina.me/">Jina</a>, <a href="https://github.com/break-stuff">Burton</a>, <a href="https://www.adekunleoduye.com/">Adekunle</a>, <a href="https://kevincoyle.co.uk/">Kevin</a>, <a href="https://bkardell.com/">Brian</a>, <a href="https://jenson.org/">Scott</a>, <a href="https://bigmedium.com/">Josh</a>, Veronika, <a href="https://ryantrimble.com/">Ryan</a>, <a href="https://joshuasager.com/">Joshua</a>, <a href="https://www.jjeff.com/">Jeff</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.littlechair.com/">Jenn</a> &amp; <a href="https://arlorobbins.com/">Arlo</a>, <a href="https://adactio.com/">Jeremy</a> &amp; Jessica, <a href="https://bethan.bandcamp.com/">Daniel &amp; Jessi</a>, <a href="https://www.lovejerks.com/">Rebecca &amp; Ryan</a>, and countless more folks. Since the US web development conference scene has more or less imploded since the pandemic, this felt a bit like a family reunion with some of my favorite people from around the world.</p>
<p>In the end, <a href="https://frostapalooza.bradfrost.com/">Frostapalooza</a> was a magical night celebrating the power of music and friendship. It feels a bit like a dream now and when I explain it to people my words fall short. An ephemeral joyous moment and I have no idea if I’ll do anything like that in my life again. That’s special. The biggest thanks to Brad, Melissa, and Ella who sacrificed a lot of time, money, and life-force to pull it off.</p>
<h2>The stats, o the stats.</h2>
<p>Okay, quantifiers. Calm down. Here’s your beefsteak of itemized inputs and outputs.</p>
<h3>🧠 Learning</h3>
<ul>
<li>When I got sick I did a deep dive in playing with <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> and building a vault. I’m still on Notion (for now) but the jump is less intimidating. I like the indie/privacy angle of Obsidian a lot but from a UX perspective it feels “finicky” when mousing over content in a way that Notion doesn’t. The level of customization is also nicer in Obsidian, but also a potential endless rabbit hole for my distracted brain. Moving my “second brain” is not a task I want to take lightly.</li>
<li>Watching countless Obsidian videos exposed me to a new organization system: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d93SGaf82OM">August Bradley’s “Pillars, Pipelines, and Vaults” (PPV) system</a>. I’m not ready to ditch <a href="https://daverupert.com/2022/04/productivity-sniped-by-para/">my Notion PARA setup</a>, but the idea PPV introduces that I’m gravitating towards is that my brain is a system of “Inputs” (links, books, and notes vaults) and “Outputs” (blog posts, side projects, and task pipelines) and those exist across “Areas” (pillars) in my life. Inputs need organization (e.g. folders and/or tags) and outputs need a process (e.g. <a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/09/my-notion-blogging-kanban/">a kanban</a>). I think Obsidian fits this paradigm better than Notion.</li>

<li>Humankind by Rutger Bregman - I’ve read this book before but it’s a pleasant little dose of positivity. Are we humans that trample each other while leaving a burning plane? Or are we humans that help each other get off the plane? The answer might surprise you.</li>
<li>Slow Productivity by Cal Newport - I liked this book better than the last but I think it suffers from the same problems all his books do… he’s shielded by academia and not that busy of a person. I laughed out loud when he used Jane Austen as an example of Slow Productivity (paraphrasing) “After her father sold the farm and the school and they moved to a beach town, she was able to slow down.” Like, yeah dude, I could slow down too if my dad retired and sold the literal farm.</li>

<h3>📺 Media</h3>
<p>Not my best summer of media consumption. But I’m back on Dropout which is nice.</p>
<p><strong>TV</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wimbledon 2024 - Watched a lot of the Wimbledon finals with my wife.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Streaming</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dropout.tv/make-some-noise/season:3">Make Some Noise S3</a> (Dropout) w- My favorite improv show. It’s punchier this season.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dropout.tv/thousandaires">Thousandaires</a> (Dropout) - What would you do with $1,000!?</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dropout.tv/dimension-20-never-stop-blowing-up">Dimension 20: Never Stop Blowing Up</a> (Dropout) - A VHS action movie fever dream but with dice.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anime</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Goldenboy (1995) - Full of fan service but has a main character that flips the genre on its head a bit.</li>
<li>Mob Psycho 100 S2 (2019) - Mob is at it again. Such a weird, fun series.</li>
<li>Gundam Breaker Battlogue (2021) - A short web series to promote a new line of Gundam models. Not my favorite “Builder” series nor is it my favorite line of Gundam models. Battlogue on all fronts feels rushed and cheap.</li>
</ul>
<h3>🧶 <strong>Crafts</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/06/mini-4wd/">Tamiya Mini 4WD Blast Arrow Starter Pack</a> - I got into watching min-cars race around a track. I bought one for me and one for my son. I finished mine. My son didn’t finish his. But we don’t have a track to race on… so I either need to pony up cash or figure out another way to race.</li>
</ul>
<h3>🤖 Gunpla</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/pgu-rx-78-2.jpg" alt="Left: the black inner frame of the 12 inch tall perfect grade gundam model. Right: the completed gundam model classic red white and blue armor applied. Smaller model of same mech included for scale in both photos." /></p>
<p>I built the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfmD1yYqP6k">Perfect Grade Unleashed RX-78-2 Gundam</a> - The granddaddy of all granddaddies. This was an incredible build start to finish. I stalled out for two weeks over adhering some metal etching parts but I tried out different glues and cements and ended up using a <a href="https://www.scotchbrand.com/3M/en_US/p/d/cbgnhw011037/">Scotch Restickable Glue Stick</a> (the same glue for Post-it Notes) and it worked great.</p>
<p>From the inner frame to the outer shell of the body armor, this model is jaw dropping. It has heft, but not too heavy. It poses but feels sturdy. Bandai nestled in gimmicks everywhere but also so subtle you’d never know they were there from a distance. I need to finish putting on all the stickers, but it’s already so incredible to look at that I fear over-decorating.</p>
