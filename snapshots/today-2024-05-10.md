## Biden set to impose tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, sources say

date: 2024-05-10, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON AND SAN FRANCISCO — U.S. President Joe Biden is set to announce new tariffs on China as soon as next week, targeting strategic sectors, including electric vehicles, according to two people familiar with the matter. 


The full announcement, which could take place as soon as Tuesday, is expected to largely maintain existing levies, according to one of the people. An announcement could also be pushed back, the person said. 


The tariffs were also set to include semiconductors and solar equipment, according to one of the people. 


Details on the precise value or categories of tariffs that would be imposed were sketchy, but the administration was said to have zeroed in on areas of interest within strategic competitive and national security areas, one of the people said. 


The U.S. Trade Representative's office made its recommendations to the White House weeks ago, but a final announcement was delayed as the package was debated internally, according to one of the sources and an additional person familiar with the matter. 


Biden, a Democrat seeking reelection in November, is looking to contrast his approach with that of Republican candidate Donald Trump, who has proposed across-the-board tariffs that White House officials see as too blunt and prone to spark inflation. 


The White House and the office of the U.S. Trade Representative declined to comment. Bloomberg News first reported the story. 


The measures could invite retaliation from China at a time of heightened tensions between the world's two biggest economies. Trump's broader imposition of tariffs during his presidency prompted China to retaliate with its own levies. 


Biden has said he does not want a trade war with China even as he has said the countries have entered a new paradigm of competition. 


Both 2024 presidential candidates have sharply departed from the free-trade consensus that once reigned in Washington, a period capped by China's joining the World Trade Organization in 2001. 


In 2022, Biden launched a review of the Trump-era policy under Section 301 of the U.S. trade law. Last month, he called for sharply higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese metal products, but the targeted products were narrow in range, estimated at more than $1 billion of steel and aluminum products, a U.S. official said. 


Biden also announced launching an investigation into Chinese trade practices across the shipbuilding, maritime and logistics sectors, a process that could lead to more tariffs. 


The Biden administration has also been pressuring neighboring Mexico to prohibit China from selling its metal products to the United States indirectly from there. 


China has said the tariff measures are counterproductive and inflict harm on the U.S. and global economy.

## Will Space Weather Blow Out My Solar Panels?

date: 2024-05-10, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjIxNTc3Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MTk1NTYyMX0.sIoandJNQPN0SVLIjhZM2yHEix-6GSNyehWAyLiSJnk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>You have probably heard by now that there’s a big solar storm on its way toward us. (If not, sign up for <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/solar-storm-watch-noaa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self">Heatmap AM</a>, our daily roundup of climate and energy news.) On Wednesday, the sun started ejecting massive columns of geomagnetic activity out into space in Earth’s direction. That geomagnetism is due to arrive around 11p.m. ET on Friday, triggering huge fluctuations in the Earth’s geomagnetic field.</p><p>Those fluctuations can actually generate their own electric current. And too much of that current can wreak havoc on the electrical grid.</p><p>The last time we got a heads up like this about a geomagnetic surge of this magnitude was in 2005, when coal generation was close to its peak in the U.S. and renewables were providing <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/us-energy-facts/" target="_blank">less than half</a> the energy they do now. So how does that changing energy mix affect the risk to the grid this time around? </p><p>Not too much, said representatives from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Organization on Friday morning. The other thing that’s happened since 2005 is that we've started paying a lot more attention to space weather — which, despite its name, bears little resemblance to Earth weather — which means grid operators are a lot better prepared to deal with it.</p><p>“We’ve been working with the power distribution community over the past decade to help them better understand space weather,” Rob Steenburgh, a space scientist with NOAA, said in a press briefing. “And their engineers have taken that information and used it to build systems that can protect the power lines more rapidly than they could before. So we’ve seen improvements in technology on the grid that get triggered by these events, and then work to protect the different assets.”</p><p>Grid operators can also respond in lower tech ways, such as by <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/texas-grid-summer-heat" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self">deferring maintenance</a> or taking systems offline. And to be clear, if there are any grid effects, those will happen just to long-distance transmission lines. Transformers and any wires connecting to your house should be totally fine. </p><p> Will the solar storm affect solar panels? According to NOAA, any panels here on Earth should be totally fine since they’re protected by the planet’s atmosphere.  Solar panels in space, e.g. those powering satellites, are at more risk depending on the height of their orbit, particularly if they’re outside the reach of the Earth’s magnet field. </p><p>The magnetic field will also determine how bad the storm gets here. Earth’s magnetic field points northward. (That’s why compasses work.) If the the solar storm’s magnetic field is oriented in the same direction, its effects will be dampened. “Think of a magnet,” said Shawn Dahl, another of NOAA’s space weather forecasters. “If you take two negative magnets and you try to put them together, they don’t connect, right? Same thing here.” That magnetic orientation can change in the course of a single storm, however, and if suddenly those two poles start drawing together, the effects can intensify.</p><p>As of now, NOAA has classified the situation as a severe geomagnetic storm — G4, on a scale that goes up to G5 — of which several have hit Earth since 2005, including one in late March. Those were weaker than the one barreling toward us at the moment, however, although we won’t know how severe this one will be until it passes satellites stationed about a million miles out in space — that is, at most 45 minutes before it hits.</p><p>So, is NOAA concerned? “Yeah, we’re a little concerned,” Dahl said, adding that in addition to coordinating with utilities and other operators of critical infrastructure, NOAA is also briefing the Federal Emergency Management Agency. GPS and other satellite-dependent technologies could experience disruptions. Will those be debilitating to society? </p><p>There’s also one big upside: “The biggest manifestation of space weather is the aurora,” Steenburgh said, a.k.a. the Northern Lights, which could be visible as far south as Alabama. Even if you can’t see anything with the naked eye, it’s worth pointing your cell phone at the sky and snapping a pic, said Brent Gordon, another NOAA space scientist.</p><p>“Cell phones are much better than our eyes and capturing light,” Gordon explained. “Just just go out your back door and take a picture with a newer cellphone and you'd be amazed at what is what you see in that picture versus what you see with your eyes.”</p>

## Batteries Are the Least Popular Part of a Carbon-Free Grid

date: 2024-05-10, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjE5NzE4OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyMjAyMjQxM30.jsvOcHRvprlXqGgIzoIDv_suOV_KJSsMKlgzK9ama64/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Here’s a shocker: Americans aren’t exactly unified in their takes on the energy transition. In a new Heatmap poll conducted by Embold Research, about a third of the more than 2,000 adults surveyed agreed that “renewable energy offers many significant benefits, with few downsides,” while about half that number said renewables have “many significant downsides, with few benefits.” Go figure.</p><p>
	Dig beneath the surface, however, and some fascinating fault lines begin to emerge. Often, these divides cut across class, gender, and even party affiliation.
</p><p>
	Take the public’s opinion on batteries, for instance. Of all the possible sources of zero-carbon power we asked people about, battery storage scored the lowest, with just 23% saying they strongly supported adding them to the energy mix in their state. By comparison, 51% said they strongly supported rooftop solar, and 36% said they strongly supported nuclear, typically a controversial energy source. Only coal and “methane gas” scored lower (although when we called it “natural gas,” it polled much higher).
</p><center><iframe aria-label="Stacked Bars" data-external="1" frameborder="0" height="414" id="datawrapper-chart-KqDGr" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KqDGr/1/" style="border: none;" title="Do you support or oppose the following types of electricity generation in your state?" width="680"></iframe></center><p>
	What’s the problem with batteries? One possibility is that even though utility-scale battery storage system fires are rare — the Electric Power Research Institute database of battery-related “<a href="https://storagewiki.epri.com/index.php/BESS_Failure_Event_Database#The_Data_in_Context" target="_blank">failure events</a>” lists just 15 last year, though one was a <a href="https://agenda.canyoncounty.id.gov/SupportDoc/GetSupportingDoc?supportDocID=1526" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">multi-day fire in a storage system in Idaho</a> — people may group them together with far more common lithium-ion battery fires with scooters and e-bikes.
</p><p>
	“Lithium ion battery fires are rarities when considered in the context of widespread deployment,” Lakshmi Srinivasan and Stephanie Shaw, who both work on battery storage policy and research at EPRI, co-signed in an email. “There are also important differences between grid-scale storage and electric micro-mobility devices like bikes and scooters” — namely that grid-scale batters are subject to regulations and testing requirements that your e-bike’s battery is not, which reduces the risk of fires.
</p><p>
	As with any major piece of energy infrastructure, the prospect of grid-scale batteries can also spark the public’s generic aversion to new construction and the sight of industrial equipment. California — which leads the country in battery storage procurement and deployment — has not been free from <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/lithium-ion-battery-fires-storage" target="_blank">local backlash</a> to utility-scale battery storage projects.  A long-planned project in San Diego County has faced <a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/story/2024-03-29/why-this-battery-storage-plant-between-escondido-and-san-marcos-has-some-residents-upset" target="_blank">persistent opposition</a> from nearby residents, even after it was scaled down by 20%, while a project north of San Francisco was <a href="https://www.thereporter.com/2024/01/11/vacaville-city-council-votes-rejects-battery-storage-exemption/amp/" target="_blank">rejected entirely</a> due to concerns about safety.
</p><p>Besides the fire and visual concerns, many people don't understand that battery storage projects fall under the category of clean energy, especially in California where they're most prevalent. When asked to identify which types of power generation they considered “clean,” only 19% picked out battery storage, compared to 78% for solar — which is increasingly co-located with battery storage — 76% for wind, and even 37% for natural gas. The only forms of power that ranked below battery storage were, again, “methane gas” and coal.<br/></p><p>While solar and wind — which battery systems can support — are well known to just about everyone, widespread deployment of battery storage is still fairly new. While Heatmap’s survey showed relatively high disapproval for battery storage, it also was the third most “not sure” energy source behind hydrogen and geothermal, two technologies that have yet to reach mass adoption in the U.S. “All new technologies are a bit of a black box until education is provided,” the two EPRI researchers said.<del></del></p><p>That education might also include how people might benefit<strong>. </strong>“Storage is a key driver of grid resilience and reliability,” Srinivasan and Shaw explained. That means fewer service interruptions for any reason, and particularly during severe weather, when back-up energy may be necessary to keep food cold and shelters warm<strong>.</strong> “All that said,” they added, “another important benefit of storage is that it supports extensive use of renewables technologies, so the most use can be made of those as well as making the electricity grid cleaner for everyone.”</p><p>It’s true that not all battery storage systems necessarily lead to lower carbon emissions. And yet batteries are absolutely essential to a decarbonized electric grid — and to keeping grids with high levels of weather-dependent resources like wind and solar stable. It's no coincidence that two states with large amounts of renewable power on the grid, California and Texas, are also <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/texas-california-grid-batteries" target="_blank">leaders in battery storage deployment</a>.</p><p>
	“While many members of the public prioritize implementing renewable energy, NIMBY concerns can be strong in some instances, often based on misinformation,” Srinivasan and Shaw told me. “Support for renewable technologies is often dependent on the tangible local benefits of the facility, rather than broader decarbonization impacts.”
</p><p>
<em>The Heatmap poll of 2,094 American adults was conducted by Embold Research via online responses from April 5 to 11, 2024. The survey included interviews with Americans in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 2.3 percentage points.</em>

## Feds have 'significant safety concerns' about Ford fuel leak recall and demand answers about the fix

date: 2024-05-10, from: VOA News USA

DETROIT  — Federal investigators say they have “significant safety concerns” about a Ford SUV recall repair that doesn't fix gasoline leaks that can cause engine fires.


The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is demanding volumes of information from the automaker as it investigates the fix in a March 8 recall of nearly 43,000 Bronco Sport SUVs from the 2022 and 2023 model years, and Escape SUVs from 2022. All have 1.5-liter engines.


Ford says the SUVs have fuel injectors that will crack, allowing gas or vapor to leak near hot engine parts that can cause fires, fuel odors and an increased risk of injuries.


In an April 25 letter to Ford released Thursday, the agency's Office of Defects Investigation wrote that based on its review of the recall repairs, it "believes that the remedy program does not address the root cause of the issue and does not proactively call for the replacement of defective fuel injectors prior to their failure.”


Ford’s remedy for the leaks is to add a drain tube to send the gas away from hot surfaces, and a software update to detect a pressure drop in the fuel injection system. If that happens, the software will disable the high-pressure fuel pump, reduce engine power and cut temperatures in the engine compartment. Owners also will get a “seek service” message.


But in the 11-page letter to the automaker, the agency asks Ford to detail any testing it did to verify the remedy resolved the problem and whether hardware repairs are needed. It also asks the company to explain any other remedies that were considered and any cost-benefit analysis the company did when it picked the fix.


Safety advocates have said Ford is trying to avoid the cost of replacing the fuel injectors and instead go with a cheaper fix that drains gasoline to the ground.


Ford said Thursday that it is working with the NHTSA during its investigation.


NHTSA also is asking ford to detail how the software will detect a fuel pressure drop, how much time elapses between cracking and detection, and what messages will be sent to the driver. It also asks what effect disabling the high-pressure fuel pump has on other fuel system parts, and how the SUVs will perform when the pump is disabled.


The agency also wants to know how much fuel will leak and whether the amount complies with federal environmental and safety standards. And it wants to hear Ford's take on “its obligations (legal, ethical, environmental and other) to prevent and/or limit fuel leakage onto the roadway at any point during a vehicle's lifespan.”


Ford has to provide information to the agency by June 21, the letter said. Depending on the results of its investigation, the agency can seek additional repairs that fix the fuel leaks.


The company has said in documents that it has reports of five under-hood fires and 14 warranty replacements of fuel injectors, but no reports of crashes or injuries.


In a previous email, Ford said it is not replacing fuel injectors because it is confident the recall repairs “will prevent the failure from occurring and protect the customer.” The new software triggers a dashboard warning light and allows customers to drive to a safe location, stop the vehicle and arrange for service, the company said. NHTSA documents filed by Ford say the problem happens only in about 1% of the SUVs.


The company also said it will extend warranty coverage for cracked fuel injectors, so owners who experience the problem will get replacements. Repairs are already available, and details of the extended warranty will be available in June, Ford said.


The recall is an extension of a 2022 recall for the same problem, according to Ford. The repair has already been tested on vehicles involved in the previous recall, and Ford said it’s not aware of any problems.


The company also said it isn’t recommending that the SUVs be parked only outdoors because there’s no evidence that fires happen when vehicles are parked, and the engines are off.


NHTSA said in documents that in the 2022 recall, which covered nearly 522,000 Bronco Sports and Escapes, Ford had the same remedy as the latest recall.

This week a “large sunspot cluster” that’s about 16 times the diameter of Earth has produced at least five mass coronal ejections, huge bursts of plasma and magnetic fields that can damage satellites and disrupt electrical grids. They will start to hit Earth today and could continue to do so through the weekend. NOAA is advising operators of satellites and grids to prepare. On the plus side, the event could mean people as far south as Alabama will be able to see the <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/MVGyDY9n3dQW8hbx5N8n4PCzVZjc4S5dX4pMN2XT75n3qn9gW95jsWP6lZ3nYW41DPY11lBK85W79qgFJ7tXvf1W2Fq-jl7csVQpN8NKDCS7CrJjW9gK7xG2GjClvN85vPX-JbccYW90RYq55cR41yW3CBHJZ30yt8BW3js-kk7_R-ygW5XS-N_8VX2VdW1pMkqc7678VXW1-dGrw1sYc1WW8DMrhQ4LNFfjW7SdDqQ5GKtLdW67zVdv4xHW8KW559DrG5GHzW6N4K33r5Z13XkW4396Tf3GlkM1W813zXQ6FllThW6-GVNs48gBWRN5n-mbrBk9kdW6zkq286YTrYmW7Jm_6r82WWC1W6XtWTC6QsRzKN3lj-7DJyvB4VtLW9b8n4pW3W5HSNRL32FQ-ZW4m-7kJ181FHGVDmtwR38GBFZN4QGChVsCc_Nf3TzVfq04" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Northern Lights</a>.

	<a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/MVGyDY9n3dQW8hbx5N8n4PCzVZjc4S5dX4pMN2XT73j5nXHsW50kH_H6lZ3kzW7bqK5T8Zzh95W1y50mP7xCj2fW6h37-P64wp-PW6KPT322xdnQJW3RCVGX7FW3llW6GJD3Z76q96KW70D-MR3V1KtCW4DGn5V69Q_D-W4zGtjd73KDQtW2-C8f98CmcCmW6_4GWy5mbM_cN8_1HkFscmNTW4f3RP56XVp3wVjMXY_2-jPVwW1JBbX211BhXFW8Rcjf61ty4HKW4pHzBx6fmpt7W81MgPV98BQgcW995p6l4F5V77W7VgWGC2qSSq7W1LKMWp3VPZcdW8gj3kW2RcfJbVQ3l-h1mC3WCW8DsfM06VdQQ2V5w2K71-c8J2VFM13-7j4fXFW8cWnJg4lnC22W12tXVH8x-bwHW7M3pZL4v7QWLW6WCv107D4JyHW1m9sxF1sKRT7W5c-WZv5Xv065f6MYgs804" target="_blank">According to UC San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography</a>, the global average concentration of CO2 in March was 4.7 parts per million (ppm) higher than in March last year, which is a greater leap than the previous highest increase of 4.1 ppm recorded in 2016. “We sadly continue to break records in the CO2 rise rate,” said Ralph Keeling, director of the CO2 program at the institute. “The ultimate reason is continued global growth in the consumption of fossil fuels.”
</p><p>
<span></span>The unusual jump is due partly to the El Niño event and an “unusual dip” in March 2023. But the records show that the rate of growth is generally increasing as we continue to burn fossil fuels. Keeling added that a very high growth rate could continue for several more months. “This recent surge shows how far we still need to go to stabilize the climate system,” he said. “Stabilization will require that CO2 levels start to fall. Instead, CO2 is rising faster than ever.” Back in 2022, NOAA <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/MVGyDY9n3dQW8hbx5N8n4PCzVZjc4S5dX4pMN2XT73j5nXHsW50kH_H6lZ3ppW7-jrRn8Wz3K-W3bR0FM1DqyYPVQYxwm6WdD4vW2MJnzG8XzF2zW79bl4z68Js1MW7jWZCy40w2wvW8jfZ6l4SDbDqW2KcwqN3ZNwb2W7rXVym4b68WwW8TsGfX2KgRdrW2zMp6Q42tVfyW8fdy0Q8PC3H1W8yBSn48RSYc7N4JyCN2hmN--W6GCFxS5XrQBJW3sf9VH55Q3P-W2B-k3w1wzLbGW5tQ97_85c9mgW27P4QY6Rfp3qW5N_vLK5fGhPKW3LQYz78mv7z8W95JJ9v4y666-W90cX6Z9bFYfNW89h5JQ1zJJTBMdJnjwCCWd-W1kDvT96PL1FbW58h2hP5M8vZZN5b-z0wMWKQTN3dQ3XVCW8PsW9dvpj-4L8TPCW4dmkQK27Xs56W2wYR1f3rr1jGf9916Yn04" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that modern CO2 concentration levels match those not seen since 4 million years ago, when “sea levels were between 5 and 25 meters higher than today, high enough to drown many of the world’s largest modern cities.”

<hr />
<h2>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</h2>
<p>Hi everyone, I’m Riccardo Mori. When it’s time to introduce myself, I rarely deviate from what you can read in the <a href="https://morrick.me/en/about">About Me</a> page on my website, mostly because I did my best there to condense so much information in a few paragraphs. Anyway, I’m from Italy but I permanently relocated to Spain almost 20 years ago. I’m a writer — I write about technology, design, user interfaces and usability, but I also write fiction. While I wish writing were my one and only job, the daily bread is currently provided by my work as freelance translator and localisation specialist. </p>
<p>My educational background is rooted in the liberal arts. During my university years, I focused on philology, Italian and English literature, and art history. While I was in uni I also did some theatre, both as an actor and also as a dramatist, but that was a brief experience. Something that lasted a bit longer were reading performances, where I used to read some of my poetry in front of a live audience. There were also specific pieces I wrote for specific performances where I was accompanied by jazz musicians. I also did some book designing work and I even worked at an advertising agency for a relatively brief period of time.</p>
<p>How did I end up doing what I do today? Well, my fascination with computers started at a young age, in the early 1980s (yeah, this is sort of an age reveal, haha), and towards the end of that decade I was involved with DTP (Desktop Publishing) and the Macintosh as my primary platform. I had been wanting an Apple computer for a long time, but back then those machines were really out of my and my family’s budget. Having the opportunity to use them for work was a blast. My first workstation was a Macintosh SE with a laser printer and a handheld black-and-white scanner. But I had to wait until 1993 to finally be able to have a Mac all for myself. Up until then, it was essentially PC at home, and Mac at work. Which actually was kind of cool, because I was learning a lot of things about both platforms.</p>
<p>So, as my technical experience grew during the 1990s, I started doing some freelance work as ‘tech support guy’ and consultant. At the same time, I was equally busy on the literary side: between the late 1980s and early 1990s I wrote a lot of poetry and short stories, and in 1993 I started <em>Laboratorio Quillink</em> <em>(The Quillink Workshop)</em>, later renamed <em>Quillink Press,</em> a sort of small design &amp; print centre aimed at publishing and distributing my own and other people’s works, which soon became the official brand for all my self-published material.</p>
<p>Since I had been studying English since the age of 4, by this time I was quite proficient and fluent in it, so I did some literary translations as well. Then I was commissioned a few technical translations for computer magazines, and eventually I started freelancing as technical translator (this was late 2000-early 2001). I was a collaborator of Macworld Italia magazine for the better part of the 2000s. Another thing I’m proud of is that in the years 2001-2010, I translated into Italian Bruce Schneier’s <a href="http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram.html"><em>Crypto-Gram</em></a>, free monthly newsletter providing summaries, analyses, insights, and commentary on security. By the way, I strongly recommend subscribing to it and following Schneier’s work if you care about cybersecurity and security in general (and in today’s world, you definitely should care about this stuff).</p>
<p>After relocating to Spain and learning Spanish, I extended my translation services to include Spanish as well. For the past 8 years or so, my translation work has for the most part shifted towards localisation, which means providing translations for software applications and interfaces; and this has its own set of challenges, as you don’t simply translate text from a language to another. You often have to work with UI constraints, and you have to translate following a specific context with its own rules, which may change from project to project.</p>
<p>I really hope this doesn’t come across as me bragging about all the things I’ve done… The truth is, there are people who, right from the start, have a clear idea of what they will do in their lives, and they work relentlessly towards that goal. I’m not one of those people. Sure, I knew I wanted to be a writer, and I worked hard to be a good writer, but I soon realised that writing was simply not enough to make a living. I’ve always been a curious person, obsessed with learning stuff and expanding my knowledge. All the things I’ve mentioned here — and, believe me, I left out a lot of other stuff — just reflect this kind of hunger, and also the need to find my path in life. </p>
<p>When you have so many interests, you end up having a lot of hobbies too, but since this is getting long already, I’ll just briefly mention photography, vintage technology and devices, typography, watches and horology in general, music and gaming. Of course I don’t have enough time to be a real nerd in any of these sectors (apart maybe from photography, which is something I cultivated since the 1980s, in film and digital format), so I’ll typically go through these in a sort of rotation, with periods where I’m more into typography, or watches, or old computers, etc. You get the idea.</p>
<h2>What's the story behind your blog?</h2>
<p>I started writing online in 1998, but at first my contributions were limited to mailing lists and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet_newsgroup">Usenet newsgroups</a>. In 2001 I opened an account on LiveJournal, and kept a sort of hybrid between blog and journal for many years there. In its early years, LiveJournal was a fantastic social network, deeper and more meaningful than anything that came after, like Facebook, Twitter or Tumblr. I have ‘met’ people there I still correspond with after all these years; people whom I consider good personal friends and not just Internet acquaintances.</p>
<p>The years between circa 2000 and 2007 saw a real boom for the blog as a form of personal expression, and I was fascinated. So much quality writing, so many interesting subjects, so many interesting people, especially in the tech sphere. But before WordPress came about, having a personal blog meant doing almost everything by hand. Registering a domain, paying for Web hosting, and knowing your HTML (and later CSS and JavaScript) to craft your own website. I didn’t have that expertise, and I didn’t know where to begin. When Apple launched iTools — the first iteration of what would become MobileMe and then iCloud — one of the service’s features was giving each user a small personal Web space (HomePage) to publish online. My first official tech blog was published there using a mediocre Mac application called BlogWave Studio. This was around late 2004-early 2005. It was mostly in Italian.</p>
<p>It was bare-bones, slow to load, clunky to publish. When WordPress arrived in 2006 (if I remember well), that changed everything. I opened an account on <a href="https://WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a> (the free blogging service) and published my ‘proper’ tech blog in Italian there from late 2005 to 2010. It was called <em>Autoritratto con mele</em> (“Self-portrait with apples”) to mean it was about tech from the perspective of an Apple user.</p>
<p>To reach a wider audience, and taking advantage of how easy publishing with WordPress was, I started a tech blog in English around 2007, called <em>The Quillink Observer</em>. Having two separate blogs seemed a good idea at the time. I could provide articles and insights for both my Italian audience, and the wider English-speaking audience at large. </p>
<p>But then I started <em>yet another blog</em> in 2008, to specifically talk about my passion for vintage Macs, vintage software and technology in general. It was aptly called <em><a href="http://systemfolder.wordpress.com/">System Folder</a></em>. It’s still accessible, but sadly these past years I’ve only had very little time to update it.</p>
<p>At this point, however, properly maintaining three main blogs was becoming a little too much work. So in 2011 I finally decided to merge <em>Autoritratto con mele</em> and <em>The Quillink Observer</em> into one website featuring articles in both English and Italian. I also decided it was time to own my identity, so I launched <strong><a href="http://morrick.me">morrick.me</a></strong> by registering and paying for the domain and for the Web hosting, and using WordPress as content management system because it was the one I was most familiar with, and still one of the most flexible.</p>
<p>When I was ready to launch my website/blog, I tried hard to find a name that could be catchy and also could really encapsulate my identity. But the few decent names I came up with just weren’t good enough, so my blog’s title is simply my name. </p>
<p>As for the writing style and my main source of inspiration: it was John Gruber and his <em>Daring Fireball</em> blog, initially. He has certainly inspired a lot of tech bloggers and writers over the years, and I have enjoyed his production for a long time. Lately, however, I feel he has lost a lot of his initial objectivity and what I call ‘critical grip’ by being a bit too close to Apple.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, my main blog is 13 years old, and it has gone through three major visual redesigns. Every time I changed its look, it was mostly due to strictly technical reasons: the blog’s WordPress theme was no longer supported, the theme creator couldn’t keep up with WordPress’ updates, and things started to break. At first I tried salvaging the whole theme structure by heavily editing chunks of CSS myself, but it was too cumbersome, and ultimately too fragile. Switching to a better-maintained WordPress theme was more efficient. The one I’m currently using is a paid theme by a small company called <a href="https://www.elmastudio.de/en/">ElmaStudio</a>, it’s still maintained, and it’s simple enough to not interfere too much with the platform updates WordPress routinely puts out.</p>
<p>You can see how my blog looked in 2011, and read about other trivia (like the evolution of my identity logo) in an article I published in 2021, <a href="https://morrick.me/archives/9398"><em>10 years of morrick.me</em></a>.</p>
<h2>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</h2>
<p>I remember one tech blogger writing, many years ago, that the secret of a successful blog was to ‘show up every day, no matter what’. I appreciate those who do, those who indeed publish daily or almost daily on their blogs. But it’s just not my style. It’s not bad advice, but to me it feels like business advice. And for me, having a blog isn’t a business endeavour. I have a blog because I want to share knowledge and perspectives. It’s because I want to communicate whenever I feel I have something to say. Consequently, I only publish when I have something to say. As I wrote <a href="https://morrick.me/archives/9727">in a past article</a>, for something to appear on my blog, three main conditions have to be fulfilled:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have something to talk about, something to say.</li>
<li>I feel I have something useful to add to the conversation.</li>
<li>I have time and will to commit to writing and publishing a piece.</li>
</ol>
<p>I typically apply these rules/conditions strictly, that’s why I generally update my blog 1-3 times per month, sometimes less.</p>
<p>Ideas for articles may come from what’s currently being debated in tech; some important product or innovation that’s been introduced; some product I discovered and I’m satisfied with, which I feel I should review to let more people know about it; some particular user interface that’s worth talking about or criticising (be it the UI of an app, of an operating system, of an appliance, etc.); more general themes regarding technology and its impact on our lives; things like these. And I tend to do my homework before speaking. I don’t like to just talk about something because I feel I have to have an opinion on everything — like a lot of people do today, sadly.</p>
<p>As for the writing and the tools, my workflow is rather simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>The draft happens in <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a>, where I write in Markdown. I don’t usually write a first draft, then a second, then a third and so forth. There is just one draft. I usually start writing and adjusting my sentences as I write. Then I reach a point where I feel I should leave the draft and go back to it later. Then there’s more writing and adjusting as I write. Then I re-read the whole piece, proofread, perform minor adjustments, have the Text-to-Speech voice in Mac OS read the piece aloud, make more small adjustments so that the article has a good flow, read the article again another couple of times, and when it’s in its final state…</li>
<li>The article is then exported to HTML. I open it with <a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a> and remove all the superfluous markup.</li>
<li>The final step is copying the article’s text with the necessary HTML entities and pasting it into <a href="https://redsweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>. From there, I add categories, tags, an excerpt, and publish the piece.   </li>
</ul>
<h2>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</h2>
<p>Not really. Whenever I’m writing an article I want to publish on my blog, I typically have a clear idea of what I want to talk about and how I want to talk about it. I’ve written pretty much everywhere — though I will admit I prefer to have a quiet environment around me. I write best at home, at dead of night.</p>
<p>Also, the tools I favour for writing are pen and paper, and traditional computers — sometimes even vintage computers, like one of my old ThinkPads, or my 2008 black MacBook running Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. These are less distracting environments than iPads and iPhones for me.</p>
<h2>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</h2>
<p>Both the process of registering the website and providing Web hosting were handled by a dear friend of mine on my behalf. So I don’t exactly know where the domain is registered. Web hosting is provided by <a href="https://bluehost.com">bluehost.com</a>, which I would say it’s a pretty reliable service. I only experienced a couple of hiccups in thirteen years. And as mentioned above, I use WordPress as CMS.</p>
<h2>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</h2>
<p>No, not really. Maybe the only thing I would do differently would be to avoid free solutions and avoid publishing on Web spaces I don’t own. I would start immediately with having a personal website, hosting, etc. Which is the exact piece of advice I would give to anyone who wants to start seriously blogging today. Use free solutions if you just want to publish something online occasionally and don’t care much about owning your identity. I still think WordPress is the best option because the company has reached a ‘too big to fail’ level by now.</p>
<h2>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising personal blogs?</h2>
<p>I currently have to pay for two registered domains, and the Web hosting (which is shared between the two). The whole operation costs me about €100-120 annually. My blog doesn’t generate revenue, apart from the occasional donation, and what little I make by selling my two books of short stories (advertised in the footer of my website). Since I have a job, I don’t need to monetise my blog. Some people told me I should do it anyway, because ‘you never know’, but I currently see no way to monetise it apart from resorting to a&#41; advertising, and b&#41; putting some content behind a paywall. And I hate both options. </p>
<p>I hate what advertising has become online. I hate that today if you want a great browsing experience, you need to install all kinds of ad-blockers. And I don’t want to subject my readers to all that crap. You can visit my website with all blockers and trackers disabled, there’s pretty much nothing going on in the background apart from some basic WordPress analytics.</p>
<p>And since my blog is not a news outlet and I don’t have to pay anyone, putting what I write behind a paywall makes no sense to me. I don’t want to divide my audience into a privileged tier and a free-for-all tier. Nor do I want to create special content for ‘patrons’ that is invisible to everyone else. </p>
<p>Time ago I tried a new spin on a consolidated formula, and I called that the <em>Small Fish sponsorship</em>. As I mention on the <a href="https://morrick.me/sponsorship">relevant page</a> of my website: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>…The spirit behind this is simple: I’m (still) a small fish compared to other prominent tech-oriented blogs and websites, and I can’t offer their kind of traffic or visibility. Thus what I ask in return is relatively modest compared to those blogs. <em>[€450 for a week-long slot]</em> Still, if a sponsor has a particularly compelling product to offer, what I can provide is potentially more than just a mention and a thank you. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It hasn’t had much of a success, so far, but I’m not complaining. I thought it was an option worth offering. For now, I’m happy with the way things are: I provide free content, and if you really appreciate something I wrote, or you found it particularly useful or illuminating, you can send a donation or purchase my books — they’re only $1.99 each.</p>
<p>Do I like people monetising their blogs and content? I guess it depends on how they do it, what they offer, the quality of such content, and so forth. As a reader, I tend to favour those creators who find a way to monetise their content that doesn’t influence the content itself. I mean, finding sponsors is great, but when your production is constantly sponsored, I start wondering about your objectivity. I generally appreciate those creators who manage to monetise what they do, what they write, by clearly separating the content from the money. An easy example: those who offer cool merchandise as a way to support them. Perhaps it’s not the greatest way to make money, but if you write tech reviews and you have a little e-store with t-shirts, mugs, desk accessories, etc., it’s very likely that I won’t question your integrity when I read the stuff you publish.</p>
<p>Another way to monetise content that’s quite popular today is to use Patreon. It’s not a bad idea, but again, it depends on how the creator embeds it in their production. Some people use it in its simplest form: <em>Support me on Patreon. There are no particular perks, just different tiers for support, from the bare minimum to fan-level support.</em> Others do the same, but also offer some perks if you pick higher tiers of patronage. I’m fine with these options. What I don’t like is using Patreon as a way to basically paywall your content. Like those ‘free’ apps you download from the App Store, which are barely functional in their free default state, and start being useful when you either make an in-app purchase or, worse, activate a subscription.</p>
<p>If 90% of what you offer is a ‘secret’ unless people become patrons, I can’t even evaluate how good (or bad) your stuff is without at least paying you once (by becoming a patron for one month, then cancelling in case I don’t like what I see).</p>
<p>There isn’t anyone in particular I’m supporting in the blog community on a regular basis. But I have shown support for different people in different ways at different times. By purchasing something via an affiliate link. By purchasing an app if the blogger in question is also a developer. By sending donations in difficult moments when the blogger specifically asked for it. By purchasing some merchandise. You get the idea.</p>
<h2>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</h2>
<p>Over the years, I’ve become increasingly selective with whom I read. There are a few prominent names in this short list, and chances are you already know them or they’ve already been mentioned by people you’ve previously interviewed. Anyway, here goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nick Heer’s <a href="https://pxlnv.com">Pixel Envy</a> is a great read. I’ve been following Nick for a long time now. While at first his blog and style resembled John Gruber’s a bit too closely, over time he has found his voice, and the overall quality of his blog has kept increasing. Very good tech commentary.</li>
<li><a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/">Michael Tsai’s blog</a> is another must-read. He has perfected the art of presenting tech news and assembling several different quotes from other writers as a way to offer you all these perspectives and points of view on any given subject. Sometimes he’ll chime in, too, but not always. This way you have a general idea of how the debate is shaping up, and you can make up your own mind without being influenced or pushed towards a particular point of view.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other blogs I enjoy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mike Rockwell’s <a href="https://initialcharge.net">Initial Charge</a>. No bells and whistles, just straight honest thoughts.</li>
<li><a href="https://schwarztech.net">SchwarzTech</a> by Eric Schwarz, another tech veteran.</li>
<li>Howard Oakley’s <a href="https://eclecticlight.co">The Eclectic Light Company</a>. I’ve been reading Mr Oakley since the days of computer magazines; he used to write articles for MacUser UK, Personal Computer World, Mac Format. His blog has two main subjects: art, and the Mac platform. His articles usually tackle technical (sometimes very technical) aspects of Mac OS and are quite informative.</li>
<li>Jesper’s <a href="https://take.surf">Take</a> blog. He is such a private person, and his blog has no personal info about him, so I only know him as Jesper. But his blog is always a refreshing read. I’ve been reading him for years and I can’t remember a time when I disagreed with anything he said.</li>
<li><a href="https://reverttosaved.com">Revert to Saved</a>, by <a href="https://craiggrannell.com">Craig Grannell</a>. A prolific tech writer who contributes to sites such as Wired, TechRadar, Stuff, Wireframe. Another enjoyable read.</li>
<li><a href="https://inessential.com">Inessential</a> by Brent Simmons. Brent is the developer of NetNewsWire, the best RSS feed reader for Mac. He doesn’t post often on his blog, but I always like when he does.</li>
<li><a href="https://joecieplinski.com/blog/">Joe Cieplinski’s blog</a>. Joe is a developer and a musician, and a great guy. He used to write more on his blog and I always loved to read his insights and points of view on Apple and tech in general. I still think his blog is worth bookmarking despite the scarce updates.</li>
<li>The only blog in Italian I’m currently reading on a fairly regular basis is <a href="https://macintelligence.org">QuickLoox</a> by my friend Lucio Bragagnolo. And I don’t just read him because he’s a friend, but because he’s a very smart person and I enjoy reading his insights. </li>
</ul>
<p>Picking a person from this list for your next interview is hard, as I’m tempted to just tell you to try contacting them all. I’d give precedence to Nick Heer, Michael Tsai and Lucio Bragagnolo if you haven’t interviewed them already. They’re all busy people, but they’re also approachable and amiable, so perhaps they’ll play along.</p>
<h2>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</h2>
<p>I’ll start with a little shameless self-promotion: I’ve written two books of short stories, which I call ‘Minigrooves’. They’re available on Apple’s Books Store and on the Amazon Kindle Store.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://morrick.me/minigrooves-short-stories">Basic info and purchase links</a></li>
<li><a href="https://morrick.me/archives/6304">More details</a></li>
<li><a href="http://minigroov.es/">Official website</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I’m currently working on a science-fiction novel called <em>Low Fidelity</em>, a project I started so many years ago. I’ve been working on it for a long time, not because it’s a particularly monumental work (although it’ll be comprised of more than one book), but because I’ve alternated periods of intense inspiration and periods of low tide where life and my main job took extreme precedence over it. You can read a bit more about <em>Low Fidelity</em> <a href="https://crosslines.wordpress.com/about-low-fidelity/">on this page</a> at the <em>Crosslines/Low Fidelity</em> website. (That website is a bit old and may contain outdated information, so navigate the rest of it at your risk, haha).</p>
<p>With all this out of the way, here’s a brief list of books I recommend. I won’t add any commentary, because otherwise this interview would never end. It’s enough to say that these are all good food for the mind.</p>
<p>Fiction:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’d recommend anything by Neal Stephenson, but I have a soft spot for his early works, like <em>Snow Crash</em>, <em>The Diamond Age</em>, and <em>Cryptonomicon</em>.</li>
<li>Truman Capote, <em>The Complete Stories</em>. Penguin Books have recently published this collection of short stories, and I loved it. Usually Capote gets recommended for his most famous works, like <em>In Cold Blood</em>, <em>Breakfast at Tiffany’s</em>, or maybe <em>Other Voices, Other Rooms</em>. But with these short stories you really feel how good of a storyteller he was. </li>
</ul>
<p>Non-fiction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nassim Nicholas Taleb, <em>The Black Swan</em></li>
<li>Jaron Lanier, <em>You Are Not A Gadget: A Manifesto</em></li>
<li>George Orwell, <em>Essays</em></li>
<li>Neal Stephenson, <em>In the Beginning... Was the Command Line</em></li>
<li>Rick Edwards &amp; Dr Michael Brooks, <em>Hollywood Wants to Kill You – The Peculiar Science of Death in the Movies</em> (Despite the grim title, this is a really entertaining, smart, and nerdy book).</li>
</ul>
<p>While I may listen to specific podcast episodes if they come strongly recommended, I’m currently not subscribed to any podcast. To be honest, I don’t particularly like the medium, but it’s mostly a ‘me’ problem. There are people who are capable of listening to podcasts while doing something else. I can do that with music, but with the spoken word, it gets complicated, especially for someone like me who has to <em>read</em> and <em>write</em> a lot for work. </p>
<p>To properly enjoy a podcast, I would have to just sit and listen to it. And many podcasts — particularly tech-oriented ones — are made of episodes lasting well over one hour and a half each. I just don’t have the time. I also think that it’s a bit disrespectful to commandeer the audience’s time by producing extremely long podcast episodes.</p>
<p>I shall end my response and this interview with a short list of games that I’ve found to be unique in one way or another. Everyone’s taste in games is different, so I’ll just offer their titles and people can check them out on their preferred platform (Steam, Epic Games, etc.). Not all of these are available for the Mac, unfortunately:</p>
<ul>
<li>Half-Life 2 (an oldie but an evergreen title)</li>
<li>The BioShock franchise</li>
<li>The Dishonored franchise</li>
<li>The Long Dark</li>
<li>INFRA↘︎</li>
<li>Disco Elysium</li>
<li>SIGNALIS</li>
<li>Kentucky Route Zero</li>
<li>Pacific Drive</li>
<li>All the Rusty Lake puzzle games</li>
<li>Alien: Isolation</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you, Manuel, for contacting me and giving me the opportunity to talk about myself and share all this information. All the best, and let’s keep in touch!</p>

## Did IBM make a $6.4 billion blunder by buying HashiCorp?

<h4>HashiCorp's programs are ideal fit for IBM/Red Hat's software lines, but why buy the company when the software's free and open?</h4> <p><strong>Opinion</strong>  In some ways, IBM paying a cool $6.4 billion for HashiCorp makes perfect sense. HashiCorp's infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool Terraform is very popular and would work well with Red Hat Ansible.

## Scores of sick, starving pelicans found along California coast

date: 2024-05-10, from: VOA News USA

NEWPORT BEACH, California — Scores of sick and starving pelicans have been found in coastal California communities in recent weeks and many others have died.


Lifeguards spotted a cluster of two dozen sick pelicans earlier this week on a pier in coastal Newport Beach and called in wildlife experts to assist.


Debbie McGuire, executive director of the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center in Huntington Beach, said the birds are the latest group that they've tried to save after taking in more than 100 other pelicans that were anemic, dehydrated and weighing only half of what they should.


"They are starving to death and if we don't get them into care, they will die," McGuire said. "It really is a crisis."


It is not immediately clear what is sickening the birds. Some wildlife experts noted the pelicans are malnourished even though marine life abounds off the Pacific Coast.


Bird Rescue, which runs two wildlife centers in Northern and Southern California, reported 110 sick pelicans in the past three weeks, many entangled in fishing line or hooks. A similar event occurred in 2022, the group said.


Wildlife organizations are focused on caring for the birds until they can be released back into the wild.

## Other uses of a car

date: 2024-05-10, from: Ed Summers blog, Inkdroid

<blockquote>
<p>
He had come from a country where mathematics and mechanics are natural
traits. Cars were never destroyed. Parts of them were carried across a
village and readapted into a sewing machine or water pump. The backseat
of a Ford was reupholstered and became a sofa. Most people in his
village were more likely to carry a spanner or screwdriver than a
pencil. A car’s irrelevant parts thus entered a grandfather clock or
irrigation pulley or the spinning mechanism of an office chair.
Antidotes to mechanized disaster were easily found. One cooled an
overheating car engine not with new rubber hoses but by scooping up cow
shit and patting it around the condenser. What he saw in England was a
surfeit of parts that would keep the continent of India going for two
hundred years. <span class="citation" data-cites="Ondaatje:1992">(<a
href="#ref-Ondaatje:1992" role="doc-biblioref">Ondaatje, 1993, p.
188</a>)</span>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This description of the uses of a car, apart from transportation, really
spoke to me about how objects can overcome their intended use, and have
an unexpected second (or third) act, when you add human care and
ingenuity into the mix. Necessity is the mother of reinvention.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
For no easy to articulate reason I’ve found myself rereading <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ondaatje">Michael
Ondaatje</a> recently. His work was very important to me in my 20s, I
think because it was in vogue at the time, after he won the Booker Prize
for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_English_Patient">The
English Patient</a>, and it was turned into a film (which won <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_English_Patient_(film)#Accolades">9
Oscars</a>).
</p>
<p>
He was born in Sri Lanka, spent his teenage years in England, and moved
to Toronto to study, where he finally settled. I was kind of wandering
in my 20s too, and I’m sure his writing appealed to me because it spoke
to that keen awareness of new places, being uprooted, and putting down
roots as best you could.
</p>
<p>
I’ve also found myself listening to some <a
href="https://pinboard.in/u:edsu/t:ondaatje/">interviews</a> with him
that are available on the web. In many ways these feel like a luxury
now, the web was still busy being born in the early 1990s. Hearing him
speak, and read from his work, lends a great deal of richness and depth
to his texts.
</p>
<p>
I think the thing I most appreciate about his novels are their poetic
quality (he’s an accomplished poet as well). You can read them
<em>slowly</em>. The chapters are sized perfectly, often being broken up
into shorter segments, that then divide into the paragraphs within. I’m
not in rush to finish, or get to <em>The End</em>.
</p>
<p>
His stories are told in intense, fluid detail, but in fragments that get
stuck together like a collage, with intentional gaps between them. These
narrative gaps invite you in to connect them–to participate in the
telling of the story. Ondaatje talks about the importance of collage in
some of his interviews. He famously starts with a very specific scene or
moment, and then grows the larger structure from it, like a generative
seed.
</p>
<p>
Another thing that came across in his interviews is how important
archival research is to his writing. He goes deep learning about a
particular topic, time, place of profession, which then infuses his
story. This of course appeals more to me now, after I’ve had a career
working in libraries and archives. Ondaatje texts have a way of
communicating this strange characteristic of surviving documents, and
even fragments of documents, to transport and change us <span
class="citation" data-cites="Harris:2002 Levy:2001">(<a
href="#ref-Harris:2002" role="doc-biblioref">Harris, 2002</a> ; <a
href="#ref-Levy:2001" role="doc-biblioref">Levy, 2001</a>)</span>. But
somehow he doesn’t do this by talking about documents explicitly. He
enacts them, and puts them to work, instead.
</p>
<p>
I lost track of him after 2000, maybe because I started reading less
fiction then, and became absorbed with work, which is something I regret
a bit. Note: keep fiction in your life. I did read <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anil%27s_Ghost">Anil’s Ghost</a>
recently, and I’ve got <em>The Cat’s Table</em> waiting on the top of
the pile on my bedside table. <em>Anil’s Ghost</em> is/was amazing. The
central character is a forensic pathologist. It’s about evidence, and
political violence, and love, and work, and … so many things.

## US Senate passes bill improving air safety, customer service

date: 2024-05-10, from: VOA News USA

washington — The Senate has passed a $105 billion bill designed to improve air safety and customer service for air travelers, a day before the law governing the Federal Aviation Administration expires. 


The bipartisan bill, which comes after a series of close calls between planes at the nation's airports, would boost the number of air traffic controllers, improve safety standards and make it easier for customers to get refunds after flights are delayed or canceled. 


The bill passed the Senate 88-4. The legislation now goes to the House, which is out of session until next week. The Senate is considering a one-week extension that would give the House time to pass the bill while ensuring the FAA isn't forced to furlough around 3,600 FAA employees. 


The bill stalled for several days this week after senators from Virginia and Maryland objected to a provision that would allow an additional 10 flights a day to and from the heavily trafficked Reagan Washington National Airport. Other senators have tried to add unrelated provisions, as well, seeing it as a prime chance to enact their legislative priorities. 


But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called a vote Thursday evening after it became clear that senators would not be able to agree on amendments to the bill before it expires. After the bill passed, leaders in both parties were still working out how to pass an extension and ensure the law does not expire on Friday. The House passed a one-week extension earlier this week. 


The FAA has been under scrutiny since it approved Boeing jets that were involved in two deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019. The Senate legislation would govern FAA operations for the next five years and put several new safety standards in place. 


The bill would increase the number of air traffic controllers and require the FAA to use new technology designed to prevent collisions between planes on runways. It would require new airline planes to have cockpit voice recorders capable of saving 25 hours of audio, up from the current two hours, to help investigators. 


It would also try to improve customer service for travelers by requiring airlines to pay a refund to customers for flight delays — three hours for a domestic flight and six for an international one.  


In addition, the bill would prohibit airlines from charging extra for families to sit together and triple the maximum fines for airlines that violate consumer laws. And it would require the Transportation Department to create a "dashboard" so consumers can compare seat sizes on different airlines. 


The FAA says that if the law expires on Friday, the 3,600 employees would be furloughed without a guarantee of back pay starting at midnight. The agency would also be unable to collect daily airport fees that help pay for operations, and ongoing airport improvements would come to a halt. 


No one in "safety critical" positions — such as air traffic controllers — would be affected if the deadline is missed, the FAA says, and the safety of the flying public would not be at risk.

## Apple (like big tech is) primed to stumble.

This&#160;past&#160;week, Apple&#160;released an ad to support the new iPads&#160;and highlight their extreme thinness. The&#160;advertisement showed creativity being crushed into the iPad. The&#160;ad,&#160;called&#160;Crush,&#160;was universally panned by everyone on social media. Apple eventually apologized.&#160; The Crush-ad masked the actual product announcement, and the company found itself on the&#160;back foot instead.&#160;The backlash highlighted Apple’s dilemma, succinctly summed up &#8230;

## Haiku isn’t a BeOS successor anymore

date: 2024-05-10, from: OS News

So I got accepted into GSoC again! I’m going to be working on WebKit2. But what is WebKit2, or even WebKit, for that matter? Well, WebPositive uses WebKit to render its web pages. Currently, we use the WebKitLegacy API to communicate with WebKit. It would be nice to switch to the newer version: WebKit2. However, our port of WebKit2 still needs work. At present, it has lost its ability to even render any webpage at all! So, getting WebKit2 to work will be the primary goal of my GSoC project. If there’s time left, I might be able to integrate it into WebPositive. The advantages WebKit2 has for WebPositive will be mostly invisible to end-users. The code will hopefully be more maintainable than the deprecated WebKitLegacy and we’ll get access to several newer APIs such as the ad-blocking API. Perhaps the most visible change: problems in one part of the code should be less likely to crash the whole browser. ↫ Zardshard on the Haiku website The current state of WebPositive, the only native Haiku web browser, is emblematic of why I have personally lost all interest in the successor to what is still my favourite operating system of all time. Haiku OS supports several browsers, and if you read any forum post about which browser to use, or watch any of the enthusiastic Haiku videos by the insanely awesome Action Retro, they&#8217;ll all advise you to use any of the non-native Qt or GTK browsers instead &#8211; because WebPositive just can&#8217;t compete with the ported, non-native browsers. Since everybody using Haiku is opting to use the better ported browsers, WebPositive has fallen even more by the wayside; now it has to play catch-up, and by the time WebKit2 has been properly ported and bug-tested, and has been integrated into WebPositive, which then has to be bug-tested as well, we&#8217;re going to be months, if not years, down the line. In the meantime, the ported browsers will have been regularly updated with newer, better versions. Unless the focus for the single most important application of any general purpose desktop operating system is placed solely on WebPositive, it simply won&#8217;t be able to keep up with the ported browsers. Why even work on WebPositive at all at that point? It&#8217;s not like anyone is using it, so why bother? And this highlights a problem for people like me, who prefer to have native Haiku applications instead of ports of software I can already run elsewhere. As a former BeOS user, I am not interested in a vessel for running Qt applications that I can, in all likelihood, run better on Linux. Why would I go through the trouble of assembling a machine with hardware Haiku supports, only to then run the same applications I&#8217;m already running on Fedora or OpenBSD, but worse? If you browse through Haiku Depot today, it feels like the vast majority of modern, maintained, and working software are ports of Qt (and GTK) software we already know and love from other, more mature, more stable, more usable, and more feature-rich platforms. Haiku has chosen to pour a lot of energy and manpower into becoming an operating system designed to run ported, often Qt, applications, but the downside to that is that new and maintained native Haiku applications, that play to the strengths of the platform, are few and far between. A Haiku developer once told me that real people use Haiku every day, and they need real applications, and ported applications make it possible for not only Haiku developers themselves, but also normal users, to run and use Haiku every day. This is a valid argument that I fully understand and agree with &#8211; it just means Haiku isn&#8217;t for me. And while that&#8217;s sad for me, it&#8217;s entirely fine. Haiku&#8217;s developers have chosen to focus on building a daily-drivable operating system with tons of ported applications, instead of an ideologically pure operating system you can&#8217;t really use because it only has like 4 native applications and nothing else. And that&#8217;s a valid, smart, and practical choice that I fully respect and understand, even if it means Haiku isn&#8217;t really a BeOS successor anymore.

## President Biden cheers Las Vegas Aces and women's basketball

date: 2024-05-09, from: VOA News USA

washington  — President Joe Biden welcomed the reigning WNBA champion Las Vegas Aces to the White House on Thursday, celebrating what he called a "banner year" for women's basketball.


"It matters to girls and women, finally seeing themselves represented," Biden said during the celebration held in the East Room of the White House. "It matters to all Americans. That's why as a nation, we need to support women's sports."


Both he and Vice President Kamala Harris were given the customary jerseys from the winning team. As he held his up, Biden yelled, "Put me in Coach, I'm ready to play!"


In her own remarks, Harris praised the team for playing with "such joy" and being role models both on and off the basketball court.


"You simply inspire people across our nation and around the world," Harris said.


The Las Vegas Aces defeated the New York Liberty in the WNBA championship last October to win their second consecutive WNBA title. As he began his remarks, Biden made a not-so-veiled reference to his own reelection prospects, noting, "I kind of like that back-to-back stuff."

## The Anxiety Behind America’s New Economic Order

date: 2024-05-09, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjE5NzI3OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MTgwNzYyOH0.UY89rpT7i8NEukvlJUgHh6zwahs8qc-ycJpEFn4DFdM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><h2>The Scene </h2><p class="drop-caps">On Thursday, the top climate diplomats from the world’s two most polluting countries are meeting in Washington, D.C. John Podesta, America’s climate envoy, and Liu Zhenmin, China’s climate envoy, will hold their first formal session and lay the groundwork for the United Nations climate conference in Azerbaijan later this year. They will discuss, among other topics, boosting climate finance and making further cuts to methane emissions, according to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/05/08/us-china-climate-meeting-podesta" target="_blank"><em>Axios</em></a>.</p><p>Both men are new to their posts, with their predecessors John Kerry and Xie Zhenhua having each stepped down in the past year. That could prove important. Kerry and Xie could draw on their long personal relationship in their negotiations: During the UN climate conference in Glasgow in 2021, their friendliness <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/climate/china-us-climate-deal-kerry-xie.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>seemed to hold</u></a> the talks together. </p><p>Now, Liu and Podesta, who is also overseeing the <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/john-podesta-tax-credits-schedule-hydrogen-sustainable-aviation-fuel-manufacturing" target="_blank">Inflation Reduction Act’s implementation</a>, must forge a new bond. And they must do so in an environment where vastly every climate-related issue — electric vehicles, coal power, industrial potency, and trade — has gotten caught up in the deteriorating relationship between the two superpowers.</p><h2>The Backdrop</h2><p class="drop-caps">Does it make sense to talk about the economy, climate change, and national security as separate issues anymore? Some of the same issues that have complicated America and China’s political and economic relationship — the former’s <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/solar-tariffs-us-china" target="_blank">rising tariffs</a>, the latter’s alleged “<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-china-climate" target="_blank">overcapacity</a>” — are inextricable from their climate policies. In a way, the questions that Podesta and Liu will confront all come down to one idea: What kind of world can we all live in?</p><p>I recently attended the Hewlett Foundation’s Common Sense conference outside San Francisco, a gathering of thinkers, scholars, and journalists from the right and left who are trying to find a “post-neoliberal” ideology, something to replace the dogma of free trade and unfettered markets that has reigned since the days of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher.</p><p>Rana Foroohar of the <em><em>FT</em></em> <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/de1ae4d1-d9ac-42d7-8e70-f9630bb6b843" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>noted</u></a> last year that the Hewlett conference aims to become a kind of post-neoliberal “Mount Pelerin Society,” the midcentury ensemble of economists, philosophers, historians, and business leaders who first plotted what later became neoliberalism. I’m not sure about that — there weren’t too many business leaders in California last month, and not every attendee adhered to the post-neoliberal school of thought — but it was a fascinating few days of discussion, and some big names, including Rep. Ro Khanna and Sen. Chris Murphy, appeared onstage. (I was there to moderate a climate policy panel.)</p><p>I agree with the central thesis, though: Look around and you can see a new school of political and economic thought come into view. At its best, this post-neoliberal ideology sees markets as one<em> </em>tool of many to organize prosperity and human effort. Its adherents believe that markets are created and organized by governments — and that, therefore, governments have a right to shape markets to achieve more societally harmonious ends. </p><p>Under Biden, the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department have investigated tech companies and blocked high-profile corporate mergers, a trend that could continue under Trump. There is an emerging bipartisan interest in industrial policy, even if Democrats and Republicans can’t always agree on how it should be used. Biden is the most pro-labor president in a generation, and even a few Republicans now sympathize with unions. (Perhaps most importantly, last month the United Auto Workers successfully organized a <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/the-id-4-could-be-volkswagens-first-ev-made-with-u-s-union-labor" target="_blank">Volkswagen factory</a> in the right-to-work South.) Lawmakers and officials talk about the economy not as a self-balancing marvel, but as a set of interlaced supply chains and industrial processes, which can sometimes be managed at the source. The government can distribute vaccines, subsidize solar panels, and contract for the production of heat pumps. </p><p>But at its worst, this new ideology seeks to seed the economy with protectionist institutions in the name of political expediency. Unconstrained, such a tendency could, for instance, degrade the American car industry, filling the roads with bloated and expensive gas guzzlers. It could make housing and healthcare even more expensive for Americans while justifying new patronage networks, autarky, and the politicized persecution of companies or industries.</p><p>Whether good or bad, though, something is coming. “I believe we’re in the seventh inning stretch of consolidating a successor to neoliberalism,” <a href="https://hewlett.org/newsroom/jennifer-harris-rejoins-hewlett-foundation-as-economy-and-society-initiative-director/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Jennifer Harris</u></a>, a former White House official who now runs the Hewlett Foundation’s Economy and Society program, said at the conference’s opening. Innings one through three were just about “jumping up and down and saying the word <em><em>neoliberalism</em></em> a lot,” she added, but now a more complete ideology is forming. Call it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/29/opinion/biden-liberalism-infrastructure-building.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a liberalism that builds</u></a>, <a href="https://drodrik.scholar.harvard.edu/sites/scholar.harvard.edu/files/dani-rodrik/files/on_productivism.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>productivism</u></a>, or something else: Policymakers are approaching the economy in a new way. </p><p>And, well, cheers for that — not three, though. Maybe two. Here at Heatmap, we try to cover that new way of thinking about economics and society in part because climate change is a big force driving that change in the first place. The challenge of decarbonization is leading policymakers to think about the real economy in new ways. You can see this in Biden’s approach to remaking the American economy: He has rejected the old climate orthodoxy that governments should price carbon and let the market do the rest in favor of a more experimental, sector-by-sector scheme of tax credits, grant programs, and public investments.</p><p>But I can only go so far in saluting this new paradigm, because the other factor driving the change is the deteriorating geopolitical environment. If the United States government is taking the reins of its economy, that is because it fears what the Chinese government might do in the near future. This anxiety, too, you can see across economic policy. Under Biden, the government’s most forceful bipartisan intervention in the economy — the CHIPS Act — stemmed from anxieties over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Even the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/11/17/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has been justified</u></a> by citing the Chinese threat. Senator Joe Manchin’s decisive support of the Inflation Reduction Act, too, was rooted in the fear — <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ford-gm-stellantis-byd" target="_self"><u>now partly realized</u></a> — that China would dominate the clean-energy future. </p><p>That must lend an air of melancholy to our post-neoliberal moment: If economic policy is getting better, it’s because the world is getting worse. </p><h2>The Stage</h2><p class="drop-caps">One more thought to complicate the Podesta-Liu talks: The two forces driving this phenomenon — the urgency of decarbonization and the rise of a menacing Sino-American relationship — coexist with great difficulty in U.S. policy. But in China, they fit more easily.</p><p>Over the past few months, the American and European press have come to terms with just how <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/chinese-ev-cars-biden" target="_blank">exceptional</a> China’s electric-vehicle and battery industries have become. This advantage is due in part to China’s large consumer market and its pre-existing proficiency at making electronics of all kinds. (China’s top EV battery maker, CATL, was spun off of a Hong Kong-based company ATL, which manufactured iPhone batteries.)</p><p>But policy has played a decisive role, too. China has subsidized its EV industry far more generously than the U.S. or Europe, and its officials have cracked down on internal-combustion vehicles to a degree not seen in the West. Why have China’s leaders leaned so much into EVs? And why has China become so skilled at manufacturing solar panels, wind turbines, grid-scale batteries, and other essential decarbonization tech? </p><p>The answer lies, in part, in its national security prerogatives. China’s economy depends on oil, of which it has almost no domestic reserves to speak of. It imports more than 10 million barrels of oil a day, and in a hypothetical Sino-American conflict, the U.S. would move to cut off China’s access. So it behooves China to invest in technologies that reduce its dependence on oil and fossil fuels. </p><p>Now, is energy security the <em><em>only</em></em> reason that China has embraced the energy transition? Of course not. Its political and corporate leaders know that decarbonization presents a massive global market opportunity. They know, too, that climate action is the humanitarianism of the 21st century: It is one of the few things that a country can do that seems to redound to every other country’s benefit. </p><p>But note that decarbonization plays virtually the opposite role in the U.S. At least for now, we have vast fossil fuel reserves, while we have to rely on imported minerals and materials to make EVs, many of them from China. Decarbonizing, in other words, does little for our energy security in the short-term — at least until sufficient mining and refining capacity opens in North America. </p><p>This is just some of what Podesta must weigh as he sits down with Liu. And it’s a good reminder: During the free trade era, climate was a side issue that could be shunted to its own UN session. Now, in more ways than one, it’s life and death.</p>

## Report: US flags risks from illicit transfers of Iranian oil off Malaysia

date: 2024-05-09, from: VOA News USA

KUALA LUMPUR — A U.S. treasury official warned of environmental risks from illicit transfers of Iranian oil off Malaysia, news portal Malaysiakini reported on Thursday, as the United States narrows its focus on financing for militant groups routed through Southeast Asia. 


The United States sees Iran's capacity to move its oil as being reliant on service providers based in Malaysia, a senior U.S. treasury official said this week. 


The official also said the U.S. was attempting to prevent Malaysia from becoming a jurisdiction where the Palestinian militant group Hamas could raise and transfer funds. 


Brian Nelson, U.S. Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said one of the main ways Iran raised money was through the sale of illicit oil to buyers in East Asia, Malaysiakini reported.  


"Many of these shipments traverse the waters around Malaysia and are loaded onto vessels of questionable legitimacy that may also pose major environmental and safety risks," he was reported as saying. 


Nelson expressed concern for any parties providing "ship-to-ship" transfers of illicit oil as such maneuvers could lead to accidents or oil spills that could threaten Malaysia's coasts.  


The U.S. Treasury has also seen an uptick in attempts by Iran and its proxies, including Hamas, to raise and move money in Southeast Asia, Nelson added.  


He urged those who wish to support humanitarian assistance to Gaza to donate to reputable charities to ensure the funds were not diverted elsewhere. 


Nelson and Neil MacBride, Treasury general counsel, are on a visit to Singapore and Malaysia this week to advance efforts in countering financing and revenue generation by Iran and its proxies.  


The office of Malaysia's prime minister did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 


But Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said he conveyed the country's stance regarding sanctions to Nelson during a meeting on Thursday. Saifuddin said Malaysia would comply with United Nations sanctions but would not recognize unilaterally applied sanctions.  


He told reporters he also informed Nelson that Malaysia had investigated and taken action against an organization with suspected links to Palestinians. He did not name the organization.

## The webs

date: 2024-05-09, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>We’re all familiar with the idea of the web, the www, the global network we pretty much all use daily. When we say “the web” we mean the whole thing, from the biggest of social platforms to the smallest of personal blogs. The web is cluttered, minimalistic, loud, and also quiet. It’s a cacophony, a hotchpotch of styles, ideas, and cultures. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1BneeJTDcU">Bo described it well</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A little bit of everything<br />
All of the time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in this eclectic mix, different people have tried to carve out niches, in an attempt to separate some of that content from the rest: <a href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/">the small web</a>, <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/cozy-web">the cozy web</a>, <a href="https://foreverliketh.is/blog/the-personal-web/">the personal web</a>, <a href="https://www.jackcheng.com/the-slow-web/">the slow web</a>, <a href="https://briankoberlein.com/tech/quiet-web/">the quiet web</a>. I find it interesting that all these have one thing in common and that is the very humane scale of the vision. The bigger the web becomes, and the more power we’re given, the more some people feel the need to get back to a more intimate space, a space where things move slower, where connections and interactions are given time to develop.</p>

## Barron Trump, 18, to make political debut as Florida delegate to Republican convention

date: 2024-05-09, from: VOA News USA

Miami, Florida — Former President Donald Trump's youngest son, Barron Trump, has been chosen to serve as a Florida delegate to the Republican National Convention, the state party chairman said Wednesday.


Republican Party of Florida chairman Evan Power said the 18-year-old high school senior will serve as one of 41 at-large delegates from Florida to the national gathering, where the GOP is set to officially nominate his father as its presidential candidate for the November general election. NBC News first reported the choice of Barron Trump as a delegate.


Barron Trump has been largely kept out of the public eye, but he turned 18 on March and is graduating from high school next week. The judge overseeing Donald Trump's hush money trial in New York said there would be no court on May 17 so that Trump could attend his son's graduation. 


Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Trump's youngest daughter, Tiffany, are also part of the Florida delegation to the convention taking place in Milwaukee from July 15 to July 18.


"We are fortunate to have a great group of grassroots leaders, elected officials, and members of the Trump family working together as part of the Florida delegation to the 2024 Republican National Convention," Power said in an emailed statement.

## How weight loss drugs are transforming the weight loss industry

date: 2024-05-09, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>A new class of weight loss drugs known as GLP-1s, like Wegovy and Zepbound, helped grow the weight loss industry to nearly $90 billion last year. Now, weight loss companies, apps and fitness companies are adapting their to programs include the drugs, as well. Also, allegations of serious fraud threaten a big U.S.-U.K. soccer deal, and China&#8217;s latest trade data showed a return to growth in April.</p>

## COSMIC improves its application store, display mirroring, and more

date: 2024-05-09, from: OS News

As its first alpha release is closing in, we have another monthly update about COSMIC, System76&#8217;s new Linux desktop environment written in Rust. This month, they&#8217;ve further polished and shored up their application store, imaginatively named COSMIC App Store, and it&#8217;s supposedly incredibly fast &#8211; something I can&#8217;t say for its GNOME and KDE counterparts, which tend to be so slow I&#8217;ve always just defaulted to updating through the command line, mostly. The file manager now has support for GVfs (GNOME Virtual file system) for making external storage like USB drives work properly, and Greeter login screen, Edit text editor, drag and drop, and copy/paste have been improved in various ways as well. Theming has seen a lot of work this month, with support for icon themes added to the App Library, fixed applet sizes, and more tweaks, while light themes have been disabled for now to fix a number of issues with colour selection being too dark. There&#8217;s also display mirroring now, which even works when the individual displays have different resolutions, orientations, and refresh rates. Pop!_OS is now also being built for ARM64, which makes sense because System76 is now also selling ARM servers. There&#8217;s also a bunch of work being done by the community as the alpha release nears.

## Opening windows in Linux with sockets, bare hands and 200 lines of C

date: 2024-05-09, from: OS News

X Server is slowly being deprecated in the Linux world and being replaced Wayland. Still X11 is an interesting protocol to look at from the perspective of binary communication and management of resource which require fast speeds. In this post I tried to cover basic information and create a simple but working app that is simple, defined in single file and easily compiles. No external code except libc was used. I find it fascinating when you can open black boxes and see how gears move each other. ↫ Hereket As much as the time of X has come and is now finally in the process of going, it&#8217;s still an incredibly powerful set of tools that even in a bare state can do way, way more than you think. X has come with its own window manager &#8211; twm &#8211; for decades, and it includes several basic applications like xedit, xclock, xterm, xeyes. Twm is actually pretty cool, and includes some features, like iconify to desktop, that I wish still existed in modern desktop environments. It&#8217;s quite bare-bones, though, and I doubt there&#8217;s anyone out there unironically using it today. As the linked article notes, even without advanced, complex libraries, toolkits, desktop environments, and so on, it&#8217;s entirely possible to create fully functional windows and applications with X. Of course, this makes perfect sense and shouldn&#8217;t be surprising &#8211; it&#8217;s the X Window System, after all &#8211; but you so rarely hear or read about it that you&#8217;d almost forget and just assume something like GNOME or KDE is an absolute requirement to use X.

## ChromeOS App Mall unifies app discovery for Chromebooks

date: 2024-05-09, from: OS News

We’ve been on the lookout for the arrival of the ChromeOS App Mall for a few months now. First discovered back in March, the new App Mall is arriving to do one, simple task: put the apps users want in one place to be found a Chromebook. While we have access to web apps, PWAs, Android apps and Linux apps on Chromebooks, it’s not always clear how to go about finding them. Should you install the web version or the Play Store version? Which Play Store apps install a PWA versus an Android app? Where should you go to find the right one for you? ↫ Robby Payne at Chrome Unboxed ChromeOS definitely needs a more unified, single place to find applications, and this seems like exactly what&#8217;s happening here.

## TikTok to start labeling AI-generated content as technology becomes more universal

date: 2024-05-09, from: VOA News USA

New York — TikTok will begin labeling content created using artificial intelligence when it's uploaded from certain platforms.


TikTok says its efforts are an attempt to combat misinformation from being spread on its social media platform.


The announcement came on ABCs "Good Morning America" on Thursday.


"Our users and our creators are so excited about AI and what it can do for their creativity and their ability to connect with audiences." Adam Presser, TikTok's Head of Operations & Trust and Safety told ABC News. "And at the same time, we want to make sure that people have that ability to understand what fact is and what is fiction."


TikTok's policy in the past has been to encourage users to label content that has been generated or significantly edited by AI. It also requires users to label all AI-generated content where it contains realistic images, audio, and video.

The public will have 45 days to have their say on the proposals, and then the DOE will narrow the list further. “In order to reach our clean energy and climate goals, we’ve got to build out transmission as fast as possible to get clean power from where it's produced to where it’s needed,” said John Podesta, senior advisor to the president for international climate policy. “The Biden-Harris administration is committed to using every tool at our disposal to accelerate progress on transmission permitting and financing and build a clean energy future.”</p><h3>2. Climeworks opens new direct air capture plant</h3><p>In case you missed it: Climeworks opened its newest commercial direct air capture plant yesterday. The Iceland-based facility, named Mammoth, is not yet operating at full capacity, with only 12 of its planned 72 capturing and filtering units installed. When the plant is fully operational — which Climeworks says should be sometime next year — it will pull up to 36,000 metric tons of CO2 out of the atmosphere annually. For scale, that’s about 1/28,000th of a gigaton. To get to net zero emissions, we’ll have to remove multiple gigatons of carbon from the atmosphere every year. “So in the context of where we need to go, Mammoth is almost nothing,” <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VVqqjg5_VSDBW1DQSl76jL9K4W6fpr4J5dT-6lN9h9bJ03qn9gW7Y8-PT6lZ3myW48wMLm5vmGF5W2pdK5Y2v9d-SVKhZrX4dprfMW3Wws1459D3LyW1nNwL17RxTQ3N4GHcjbXqN_NW8ml-547ycmyCVCxxK32TDpWvW26S3kX2W0S1TN791rjWCft8sW6Wl3vr3LQxqGW4Gp2Vf43D1MfW6VM_dm8z5KVGW8ZVktV1nR8S5W5240jQ5yXY6NW2CbgVQ3D-BL7N45st5Sd0KhHW5mmqG85x8W1VW6tNHQR3w02r5N1bprCyw8y8dW5tFTsN8-GQchW2TdH4-5lfzqSN2hs499P3B1rW6xRDlc5PNrbxW3bSh_n4nTWq3W472ZZG84PRPMd9VmvC04" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote Heatmap’s new climate tech reporter Katie Brigham</a>. “But in the context of our current reality, it’s nine times the size of the next largest DAC facility: another Iceland-based Climeworks plant called Orca. And it’s a major stepping stone towards the company’s ultimate goal of capturing a million metric tons of CO2 yearly by 2030 and a billion by 2050.”</p><h3>3.

It concludes that biodiversity loss, toxic chemicals, the introduction of invasive species, and of course, human-caused climate change, are all associated with “increases in disease-related end points or harm.” Biodiversity loss was found to be particularly dangerous, because it likely drives pathogens to evolve to target new and more abundant hosts.</p><p>One biologist who wasn’t involved in the research <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VVqqjg5_VSDBW1DQSl76jL9K4W6fpr4J5dT-6lN9h9bJj3qn9gW8wLKSR6lZ3nfW8lfM565FsDnKW7CG5kB4KL3G0W7zTtcD1y25gNN1DW_CVPzqSPW6rbmxV5mcQH5N2xFhk24Z86dW13wR2K1wpW2kW5DqWhr7CZlMJN2dPyTQLtK2NW2ypB-W7fTmNNN93BN37hZGzkW2z9pw33jlwr-N61qNJKBJq6sV9bNJD87HCf2W3QjY181Tv6cyW5Kwvq94vbyxjW5zbX195nJnt3W6cPcQn1f2BNjW88Sql78vM8QbW7mFTqf3Ym58yW7m8Wbs8FFf9mW99nstq4C__QMW60ZJY13dg6JJW1-7_f77z4n62W7TQr932T4Fv1W10QSJH7H3JY_W6c6y8d6CD39SW6NX0Gr7y_9fMf713dtl04" target="_blank">called it</a> “one of the strongest pieces of evidence that I think has been published that shows how important it is health systems start getting ready to exist in a world with climate change, with biodiversity loss.”</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p>Florida is <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VVqqjg5_VSDBW1DQSl76jL9K4W6fpr4J5dT-6lN9h9bJj3qn9gW8wLKSR6lZ3lNW87r7Kc7w7ZlSW97j2Vp8NMTmbW2pQ8cN30gGQfN6N5LjltySnvV6hC-r6jW-2GW1LrRXY8Z6s2lW5DlsqR11l_S4W64ynmm3r20WzW3scw8h4cCdylW1Ltzpz6tLpSYW33-jLd435jhFV6N3z_1fXTj5W3wD6t52bdSNrW3Xc8Xd7ssmGXMf9f6gJR5S9W2QVyW97Z-DSxW7_1Fkg7Yxq0wN6mbzG73b8XrN451lc8-s88xW4ZmSyB5pBBbMN2mPglmK15-FW1glGSk8SzX8VW2MN9BK74226fVvrDHx8bf2_WW3XLZvZ3Mtz5yW3TfL2M3NfsRfW2gLCpN6MdPBLN3y4ZDwZQbklf4nf38R04" target="_blank">likely to make it illegal</a> to release balloons into the air outdoors.</p>

## PostgreSQL 16.3, 15.7, 14.12, 13.15, and 12.19 Released!

date: 2024-05-09, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>The PostgreSQL Global Development Group has released an update to all supported
versions of PostgreSQL, including 16.3, 15.7, 14.12, 13.15, and 12.19.
This release fixes one security vulnerability and over 55 bugs reported
over the last several months.</p>
<p>A security vulnerability was found in the system views
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-stats-ext.html"><code>pg_stats_ext</code></a>
and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-stats-ext-exprs.html"><code>pg_stats_ext_exprs</code></a>,
potentially allowing authenticated database users to see data they don't have
sufficient privileges to view. The fix for this vulnerability only fixes
fresh PostgreSQL installations, namely those that are created with the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-initdb.html"><code>initdb</code></a> utility
after this fix is applied. If you have a current PostgreSQL installation and are
concerned about this issue, please follow the instructions in the "Updating"
section for remediation steps.</p>
<p>For the full list of changes, please review the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/">release notes</a>.</p>
<h2>PostgreSQL 12 EOL Notice</h2>
<p>PostgreSQL 12 will stop receiving fixes on November 14, 2024. If you are

<h2>Updating</h2>
<p>All PostgreSQL update releases are cumulative. As with other minor releases,
users are not required to dump and reload their database or use <code>pg_upgrade</code> in
order to apply this update release; you may simply shutdown PostgreSQL and
update its binaries.</p>
<p>For existing installations that are impacted by CVE-2024-4317 that wish to
remediate the issue, you will have to perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Find the SQL script <code>fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code> in the <code>share</code> directory of
your PostgreSQL installation (e.g. in <code>/usr/share/postgresql/</code>), or download it
from the PostgreSQL git repository from one of the URLs below. You will need to
use the script that matches your major version:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_16_STABLE">PostgreSQL 16</a>: <a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_16_STABLE">https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_16_STABLE</a></p>
</li>
<li><a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_15_STABLE">PostgreSQL 15</a>: <a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_15_STABLE">https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_15_STABLE</a></li>

</ol>
<p>From the above URLs, you can click the URL that says "raw" to download a version
that you can copy and paste.</p>
<p>Be sure to use the script appropriate to your PostgreSQL major version. If you
do not see this file, either your version is not vulnerable (only PostgreSQL 14,
15, and 16 are affected) or your minor version is too old to have the fix.</p>
<ol>
<li>In each database of the cluster, run the <code>fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code> script as
a database superuser. For example, in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html"><code>psql</code></a>,
with the file located in <code>/usr/share/postgresql/</code>, this command would look like:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>\i /usr/share/postgresql/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code></p>
<ol>
<li>You must also execute this script in the <code>template0</code> and <code>template1</code>
databases, or the vulnerability will still exist in databases you create later.
To fix <code>template0</code>, you'll need to temporarily allow it accept connections. You
can do this with the following command:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS true;</code></p>
<p>After executing the <code>fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code> script in <code>template0</code> and
<code>template1</code>, you should revoke the ability for <code>template0</code> to accept
connections. You can do this with the following command:</p>
<p><code>ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS false;</code></p>
<p>Users who have skipped one or more update releases may need to run additional
post-update steps; please see the release notes from earlier versions for
details.</p>

## Integrity of the Scholarly Record (ISR): what do research institutions think?

date: 2024-05-09, from: Crossref Blog

<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/frankfurt-isr-roundtable-event-2023/" target="_blank">we reported on the roundtable discussion event</a> that we had organised in Frankfurt on the heels of the Frankfurt Book Fair 2023. This event was the second in the series of roundtable events that we are holding with our community to hear from you how we can all work together to preserve the integrity of the scholarly record - you can read more about insights from these events and about ISR in <a href="https://www.crossref.org/categories/research-integrity/" target="_blank">this series of blogs</a>.</p>
<p>Research institutions are one of the most important stakeholders in the endeavour of research integrity, and any conversation around ISR is incomplete without the views of this key community. This fact was acknowledged at the second ISR roundtable event, and one of the main takeaways from the discussions was to make more focused efforts to hear the viewpoints of researchers and academics.</p>
<p>As the first step in this direction, we organised an online discussion on the integrity of the scholarly record, to which we invited: researchers and academics, research integrity experts based at academic institutions, Crossref members, as well as other organisations working on this topic such as COPE and Digital Science. The primary objective of this event was to hear from this community their perspectives on preserving and leveraging the integrity of the scholarly record and to identify opportunities for collaboration in this area. To ensure common ground, we also wanted to share information about Crossref metadata, the Research Nexus vision, and our position and role in the integrity of the scholarly record.</p>
<p>To facilitate this, the event started with an introduction by Kora Korzec, Head of Community Engagement and Communication at Crossref, to our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/about/" target="_blank">mission and vision</a> and the importance of capturing the relationships between the objects, people and places involved in research through the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/" target="_blank">Research Nexus</a>. Amanda Bartell, Head of Member Experience, was next and she spoke about <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/isr-part-one-what-is-our-role-in-preserving-the-integrity-of-the-scholarly-record/" target="_blank">the scholarly record and the role that Crossref plays in preserving the record’s integrity</a>. In her presentation, Amanda emphasised that Crossref’s role is not to assess the quality of content deposited by the members but rather to provide infrastructure that enables the community to provide and use metadata about the scholarly content produced by members. It’s important not to put up barriers to entry, but to work with all publishers to encourage best practices.</p>
<p>Dominika Tkaczyk, Head of Strategic Initiatives, shared details of a few Crossref projects that focus on monitoring and improving metadata completeness, thereby supporting ISR. These projects include improving the Participation Reports, using metadata matching to discover new relationships (e.g., <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/discovering-relationships-between-preprints-and-journal-articles/" target="_blank">preprint <em>published</em> as work</a>, <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-more-the-merrier-or-how-more-registered-grants-means-more-relationships-with-outputs/" target="_blank">work <em>supported</em> by funder</a>, etc), and importing more retractions and other updates from the Retraction Watch database that was <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/news-crossref-and-retraction-watch/" target="_blank">acquired and made openly available by Crossref</a>. Dominika used these examples to highlight the ways in which open and complete metadata can help in uncovering large scale trends and systemic concerns. The final speaker was Amanda French, <a href="https://ror.org/" target="_blank">ROR</a> Technical Community Manager, who introduced the audience to the Research Organization Registry, or ROR.</p>
<p>To accomplish the primary aim of the event, which was to hear the community’s viewpoints, the participants were divided into breakout groups for discussions and given three prompts to answer. The rest of the blog is a summary of what we heard from the participants.</p>
<h3 id="1-is-crossrefs-role-what-you-expected-what-surprised-you-what-are-we-missing">1. Is Crossref’s role what you expected? What surprised you? What are we missing?</h3>
<p>An overarching sentiment from the academics in the audience was that Crossref does so much more than is known to researchers! They were surprised by the range of activities underway at Crossref. At the same time, there were calls for Crossref to play a bigger role. Suggestions included playing a leadership role in deciding which metadata elements are a priority, providing guidance on the main metadata components important for signalling trust, playing a greater role in connecting various identifiers to ensure that relationships between different content types are preserved well, and to coordinate the efforts being taken by institutions, publishers and service providers around research integrity, by virtue of Crossref’s unique position in the community. There was a broad agreement that by providing the essential infrastructure, Crossref acts as the base upon which other actors in the scholarly community can build.</p>
<h3 id="2-what-metadata-elements-do-you-consider-important-for-signalling-trust">2. What metadata elements do you consider important for signalling trust?</h3>
<p>Many participants spoke about the various ways in which author identity and affiliation are important as trust signals. Being able to identify when an author has changed institutions, or being able to make a distinction between authors who have the same name is important. Author affiliations that are authentic and verified would go a long way in establishing trust.</p>
<p>Multiple assertions, e.g. for affiliations, would be welcome. The use cases for this could be when research starts at one institution and is carried over to another, or when researchers affiliated with an institution may perform part of the research overseas. Some of the participants, who actively investigate research data, shared that abstracts are valuable because they can be used for large scale analyses related to research integrity.</p>
<p>Other metadata elements that came up during this discussion were data on peer review, ethics approval, patient and donor consent in medical research, editorial boards (especially of special issues), pre-registration, funding metadata, datasets and programming scripts.</p>
<h3 id="3-what-value-do-you-see-in-the-integrity-and-completeness-of-the-scholarly-record-in-the-way-you-operate-how-do-you-contribute-to-it-how-can-it-support-you-to-achieve-your-own-goals">3. What value do you see in the integrity and completeness of the scholarly record in the way you operate? How do you contribute to it? How can it support you to achieve your own goals?</h3>
<p>Participants acknowledged that integrity of the metadata and the scholarly record is essential. Ensuring this integrity is a dynamic process, much akin to the concept of organised scepticism which is the notion that all scientific work should be trusted subject to its verification. Several ideas were shared on how to progress the integrity and completeness of the scholarly record. One recommendation was to use multiple metadata trust markers as that can make it harder for bad actors to game the system, but this may run the risk of making things complicated. Another suggestion was to make metadata part of the onboarding procedure- by gathering staff ORCID iDs during the onboarding process and sharing the institutional ROR ID with staff to promote its use, institutions can ensure that this information is routinely made available. The metadata deposited with Crossref should be integrated with downstream workflows to better facilitate the use of this rich metadata. An example of this is to integrate Crossmark with other research tools such as reference management software.</p>
<p>The participants acknowledged that this discussion underlined for them the fact that having identifiers in itself is not an indicator of quality and that the underlying metadata records and wider context is key to understanding trustworthiness of the content.</p>
<p>This event was a good first step towards engaging researchers and academics in the conversation about ISR. It connected folks working in different parts of the world who are united by their interest in research integrity. There was good engagement among all and commitment to continue these conversations in the future, with many participants planning to connect at the <a href="https://wcri2024.org/" target="_blank">World Conference on Research Integrity</a> in June (I’ll be attending as well, for anyone who wants to continue the conversation - along with my colleagues Fabienne and Evans).</p>
<p>At Crossref, we plan on continuing these conversations with all segments of the community to understand their needs and perceptions around metadata. The greater the awareness about the importance of metadata and its applications, including for research integrity, the richer the metadata that we are able to collect together. This will lead to building a comprehensive Research Nexus and emergence of more relationships therein. Please write in response to this post on our Community Forum if you have any thoughts on this as we’d love to hear from you.</p>
