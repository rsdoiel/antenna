date: 2024-11-01, from: Liliputing

## Chuwi UBox is a $329 mini PC with Ryzen 5 6600H, USB4, and 2.5 GbE LAN

date: 2024-11-01, from: Liliputing

<p>There are a few ways to keep costs down when building a mini PC. One is to opt for an inexpensive, low-power processor like an Intel Alder Lake-N chip. Another is to just use older processors that are no longer state-of-the-art. Chuwi&#8217;s new UBox mini PC takes the latter approach. It&#8217;s a small desktop computer [&#8230;]</p>

## Kong Go CLI

date: 2024-11-01, from: Miek Giebin blog

I&rsquo;m a fan of Kong the CLI argument parser, I use it to automatically create manual pages, (bash) completion and do a lot of validation inside it. (This guy also has other really interesting packages, and he&rsquo;s a huge fan of Go&rsquo;s struct tags).
I wanted to do validation inside Kong as well, for this Kong has validation, which is just a method (Validate() error) on a type. Now most types I have are just string or any other builtin type.

## Lilbits: Pixel 9a and Android 16 are coming in early 2025, ChatGPT is now a search engine, and Thunderbird comes to Android

## Harris for President

date: 2024-10-31, from: Innessential (Brint Simmons' blog)

<p>Donald Trump is a gross villain and a traitor to our country. He’s a convicted felon, adjudicated rapist, and head of a criminal organization; he works with criminals and he pardons criminals; he’s a narcissist and violent insurrectionist, racist and misogynist; he’s the master of lies and corruption and self-serving.</p>

<p>He plans to rule as a fascist dictator, and this time has the backing to do so, for the benefit of him and his ultra-wealthy friends. Not for you.</p>

<p>For everybody else, the various enemies within — everybody who isn’t a straight white male who goes along with the program — there will be concentration camps, deportation, prison, and rumors and threats of each. There will be more deaths in hospital parking lots.</p>

<p>I have voted for Kamala Harris. I ask you to vote for her too.</p>

<p>I happen to think Harris would be very good, possibly even great, as president. But it hardly matters!</p>

<p>Voting for her is how we stop this. And we have to stop this.</p>

## Summary of changes for October 2024

date: 2024-10-31, from: Hundred Rabbits blog

<p>Hey everyone!</p><p>This is the list of all the changes we've done to our projects during the month of October.</p>

<h2>Summary Of Changes</h2>
<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/videos/october_2024.jpg" alt="little ninj has carved a pumpkin, saying BEE-HOLD! The pumpkin is smiling, in a non-threatening and eager kind of way.

</ul>

<p>Pino is back in Victoria. Being back in a city also means that we are shipping <a href="https://100r.co/site/store.html#stickers">sticker sheets</a> again! Devine found a spirograph set at a thrift store for 5$, we now make <a href="https://100r.co/media/content/stream/2024_spiro.jpg">patterns</a> on every letter we ship.</p>

<p>We are happy to announce the official release of <a href="https://100r.co/site/rabbit_waves.html">Rabbit Waves</a>! The idea for the project came after discussing the disappearance of certain traditional seasteading skills and maritime communication knowledge that we believe are valuable when electronics misbehave, but that are also just generally fun to learn and use. The world of the micro-site will grow as we think of new ideas to expand it.</p>

<p>Devine participated in <a href='https://forum.merveilles.town/thread/101/drawtober-2024-109/' target='_blank'>Drawtober</a> again this year and completed a <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/pocket_rewriting.html" target="_blank">zine</a> that teaches the basics of multiset rewriting with examples, it also includes the source for a tiny Fractran interpreter. Since its release, many people have printed their own. Avanier went a step further and <a href="https://100r.co/media/content/stream/2024_joshavanier_zine.jpg" target="_blank">re-drew the zine</a> on black paper! Devine also released an <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/tote.html" target="_blank">interactive version</a>, and CapitalEx created with it a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yiso80ANlc'>beautiful little world to explore</a>! <a href='https://handmadecities.com/seattle/'>Handmade Seattle 2024</a> is coming up, Devine will be there to talk about weird computer stuff, and will hand out copies of the zine too.</p>

<p>This year, we carved a Calcifer <a href="https://100r.co/media/content/inventory/pumpkin_calcifer_01.jpg" target="_blank">pumpkin</a> (see our other <a href="https://100r.co/site/halloween_pumpkins.html">Halloween pumpkins</a>).</p>
