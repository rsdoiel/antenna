## Blinken warns China over support for Russia’s war efforts

date: 2024-04-26, from: VOA News USA

Seoul, South Korea — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed "serious concern" about China's support for Russia's defense industry on Friday, warning Chinese leaders that Washington could impose sanctions over the matter.


Blinken's comments came in Beijing, shortly after he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other senior Chinese leaders during meetings that covered a wide range of disputes between the two powers.


Near the top of Blinken's agenda, U.S. officials said, was China's provision of items such as microchips, machine tools, and other items Russia is using to create weapons for use in its war against Ukraine.


"I told Xi, if China does not address this problem, we will," said Blinken.




For weeks, U.S. officials have hinted at further sanctions meant to deter China's provision of so-called dual-use items to Russia, which Washington says has been crucial to Moscow's war on Ukraine. It is not clear how far Washington will go, however, since cutting off major Chinese banks from the U.S. financial system also could hurt the U.S. and global economy.


At a press conference in Beijing, Blinken did not reveal details about any possible measures, stating only that the United States has already imposed sanctions on more than 100 Chinese entities. "We're fully prepared to act, take additional measures, and I made that very clear in my meetings today," he noted.


China has defended its approach to Russia, saying it is only engaged in normal economic exchanges with a major trading partner. In his public remarks Friday, Xi did not mention the Russia-Ukraine issue. Instead, he focused on the necessity for U.S.-China ties to improve.


"China and the United States should be partners rather than rivals; help each other succeed rather than hurt each other; seek common ground and reserve differences, rather than engage in vicious competition," Xi said.


Blinken's meeting with Xi had not been previously announced but was widely expected.


U.S.-China relations stabilized last year, after Xi met U.S. President Joe Biden in California. At that summit, the two sides agreed to reopen military-to-military communication and take steps to reduce the flow of fentanyl, a dangerous narcotic responsible for tens of thousands of drug overdoses in the United States each year.


Blinken cited "important progress" on the fentanyl issue, even while insisting China needs to do more, including prosecute those who sell chemicals and equipment used to make fentanyl. Blinken also announced that both sides agreed to hold their first talks related to concerns over artificial intelligence.


Even as communications lines remain open, the United States and China continue to spar over a broad range of issues, including trade policies and territorial disputes.


The Biden administration is concerned about cheap Chinese exports, including heavily subsidized green technology products they say are undercutting U.S. companies.


During a five-and-a-half hour meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday, Blinken raised concerns, including the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, Chinese activities in the disputed South China Sea, and the need to avoid further escalation in the Middle East and on the Korean Peninsula, according to a U.S. readout.


China accuses the United States of inappropriately trying to contain its economic and military power. Following his meeting with Blinken, Wang said China-U.S. ties are "beginning to stabilize" but asserted that negative factors are "increasing and building," warning that the relationship faces "all kinds of disruptions."


"Should China and the United States keep to the right direction of moving forward with stability or return to a downward spiral?" Wang asked. "This is a major question before our two countries."

## Live together in perfect harmony…

date: 2024-04-26, from: Status-Q blog

I&#8217;m fond of both milk and dark chocolate. Milk chocolate is yummy kiddy comfort food. Dark chocolate is more sophisticated, more bitter, more &#8216;adult&#8217;. It&#8217;s also less likely to melt at inconvenient times, so helping you preserve that more sophisticated appearance. But the problem, I find, is that dark chocolate often has too little taste. <a class="more-link excerpt-link" href="https://statusq.org/archives/2024/04/26/12039/">Continue Reading<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span></a>

## Philip Wasserman | An Ethical Spoiler Alert to Ponder

date: 2024-04-26, from: The Signal

<p>My latest streaming binge is “3 Body Problem” on Netflix. This is a smart and creative science fiction series with a good dose of mystery, and a dash of detective story. Happily, there are no flying saucers or laser guns, at least so far. I’ve received a basic lesson in quantum physics that I understood, [&#8230;]</p>

## P&B: Veronique

date: 2024-04-26, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>This is the 35th edition of <em>People and Blogs</em>, the series where I ask interesting people to talk about themselves and their blogs. Today we have Veronique and her blog, <a href="https://veronique.ink">veronique.ink</a></p>
<p>To follow this series <a href="https://peopleandblogs.com">subscribe to the newsletter</a>. A new interview will land in your inbox every Friday. Not a fan of newsletters? No problem! You can read the interviews here on the blog or you can subscribe to the <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/feed">RSS feed</a>.</p>
<p>If you're enjoying the People and Blogs series and you want to see it grow, consider supporting on <a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">Ko-Fi</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Veronique, and I’m an artist, writer, and zine maker. I live in Toronto with my dog, Muskoka. I love making zines and championing small-press indie writers. I enjoy discovering new artists, going for trail hikes with my doggo, making art while listening to tunes, daydreaming, exchanging emails as personal letters, and discovering new personal blogs. Lately, I’ve been teaching myself how to play my late father’s guitar.</p>
<h2>What’s the story behind your blog?</h2>
<p>I started my blog in August 2022, after stumbling upon a few personal sites. I became enchanted by these quiet spaces away from social media. One blog in particular, <em>TMO</em> (no longer active), inspired me to start writing. His vulnerable, daily slice-of-life posts immediately catapulted me into wanting to document my life through blogging. </p>
<p>My search for a simple writing platform took some time, but eventually, I came across <a href="https://bearblog.dev"><em>Bearblog</em></a>, which won me over with its simplicity. I’m not tech-savvy, so the fewer bells and whistles a platform has, the more I can concentrate on what matters—writing. </p>
<p>My dad fell ill in the fall of 2022, and writing on my blog became a lifeline. Writing online created a cocooned arena for exploring my wayward thoughts and feelings and forged an invisible string, tying me to far-flung strangers across the web. Blogging felt like a refuge and reminded me that we’re all sharing this bumpy, precarious timeline together.</p>
<p>I read once that you should write your obsessions. Not only for yourself but also to find your <em>kind</em>. Being an introvert, this sentiment really resonated with me. Connecting through personal blogs can sometimes feel deeper than in-person interactions. Since writing on my blog, I’ve met the most wonderful internet denizens who have morphed into veritable email comrades—and I love it. </p>
<h2>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</h2>
<p>My posts are primarily short-form and meant to be a catch-all container for ideas and preserving fragments of ordinary moments. I prefer to write in spontaneous, off-the-cuff spurts. Thoughts, ideas, and links to things I want to share are written in my phone notes app or the myriad unfinished journals around my apartment. </p>
<p>I’ve been fond of writing posts in bullet form lately. It's a quick way to record passing thoughts and share pictures, ideas, and quotes I like. I feel like personal blogs are in constant flux and unpolished by nature, which appeals to me. </p>
<h2>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also, do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</h2>
<p>I like to write first thing in the morning before I'm swayed emotionally by other people's output.</p>
<p>I’ve romanticized having an old wooden "writers’ desk" in the corner of my living room, but I have a sneaking suspicion I’d still end up on the couch, scrunched up with horrible posture with my laptop over my legs. </p>
<p>I like to blog on my phone when I'm out and about—busy pubs, cafes, or on the bus. Plunking myself in new places sharpens my observational rolodex and removes me from my regular inner dialogue. </p>
<h2>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</h2>
<p>My setup is minimal. I write on my MacBook Air M2 laptop and iPhone 15 Pro phone. Bearblog hosts my blog, and my domain name is registered with GoDaddy. C'est tout!</p>
<h2>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</h2>
<p>I haven’t been blogging long, but I wish I was more versed in HTML and CSS. I’ve spent countless hours combing the net for tips on how best to tinker with my site. I enjoy it, though, as it feels like solving a mini-puzzle.</p>
<p>The other thing would be allowing people to subscribe to my blog with their email. I need to remedy that asap. </p>
<h2>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetizing personal blogs?</h2>
<p>For now, Bearblog is $20 a year, and it costs me about $35 to renew my domain. </p>
<p>Monetizing a blog feels like a touchy subject, and a lot of people are put off by paying someone for online writing. Newsletter fatigue is real, and being hit with member fees in every nook and cranny on the net is rampant. </p>
<p>But from a creative perspective, people still have to pay rent, and people still need to eat. </p>
<p>Artists, writers, and makers should and <em>can</em> make a living doing what they love. </p>
<p>I’m a huge proponent of supporting artists for their work. I allocate about $20 a month to support my favorites through platforms like Patreon, BMAC, Ko-Fi, independent newsletters, and one-off coffees. </p>
<p>I'd love to make a living from writing on my blog. Is this realistic, especially without ads, trackers, sponsored posts, or paywalls? I don’t know, but I spend a lot of time thinking about how to make it work. I keep trying different things and am not afraid to pivot if something isn’t working. It's tough, but it's something I love working towards. </p>
<p>The idea of making money from my writing still feels uncomfortable sometimes. There’s a touch of imposter syndrome, low self-esteem, and not feeling in league with the high-caliber writers of Substack, etc, but I keep pushing through. However, money aside, writing and sharing things on my blog is something I deeply cherish and will continue doing regardless of monetary gain. </p>
<h2>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</h2>
<p>There are so many blog gems I love! Here's a few favs: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://anhvn.com/">Anh's</a> website is so fun and whimsical. I’m in awe of her site’s aesthetic and how she incorporates her illustrations to further express herself.</li>
<li><a href="https://lili.bearblog.dev">Lili's Musings</a>. Uncut, thought-provoking writing. Themes include diary-like entries, thoughts on academia, unraveling the writing process, trans struggles, and processing anxieties. </li>
<li><a href="https://dahlstrand.net/2024/03/14/this-is-a.html">Sven Dahlstrand</a>. A cool human being with a really fun blog who's always linking to interesting things. </li>
<li><a href="https://rusi.me">Growing Old With You</a>. Ru’s blog is a tapestry of poignant writing and laid-bare slices of life, and I admire her vulnerability on the page.</li>
<li><a href="https://thewallflowerdigest.co.uk">The Wallflower Digest</a> Alice’s blog is new to me, and I’m having so much fun devouring her writing. She’s a book-loving introvert who grapples with social anxiety (like me!), and her writing topics and hobbies are wide and varied. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Lili</em> and <em>Anh</em> would both be great guests for your next interview!</p>
<h2>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</h2>
<p>Read more poetry and zines! </p>
<ul>
<li>New to zines? Let Bre from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@brattyxbre">brattyxbre</a> and Wesley from <a href="https://youtube.com/@TwentyTwoZines">Twenty-Two Zines</a> guide you. </li>

<li><a href="https://lizmasonisawesome.com">Liz Mason</a> She's been making zines for over 20 years and manages <a href="https://www.quimbys.com">Quimby's</a> Bookstore in Chicago. </li>

## Corporate greed from Apple and Google have destroyed the passkey future

date: 2024-04-26, from: OS News

William Brown, developer of webauthn-rs, has written a scathing blog post detailing how corporate interests &#8211; namely, Apple and Google &#8211; have completely and utterly destroyed the concept of passkeys. The basic gist is that Apple and Google were more interested in control and locking in users than in providing a user-friendly passwordless future, and in doing so have made passkeys effectively a worse user experience than just using passwords in a password manager. Since then Passkeys are now seen as a way to capture users and audiences into a platform. What better way to encourage long term entrapment of users then by locking all their credentials into your platform, and even better, credentials that can&#8217;t be extracted or exported in any capacity. Both Chrome and Safari will try to force you into using either hybrid (caBLE) where you scan a QR code with your phone to authenticate &#8211; you have to click through menus to use a security key. caBLE is not even a good experience, taking more than 60 seconds work in most cases. The UI is beyond obnoxious at this point. Sometimes I think the password game has a better ux. The more egregious offender is Android, which won&#8217;t even activate your security key if the website sends the set of options that are needed for Passkeys. This means the IDP gets to choose what device you enroll without your input. And of course, all the developer examples only show you the options to activate &#8220;Google Passkeys stored in Google Password Manager&#8221;. After all, why would you want to use anything else? ↫ William Brown The whole post is a sobering read of how a dream of passwordless, and even usernameless, authentication was right within our grasp, usable by everyone, until Apple and Google got involved and enshittified the standards and tools to promote lock-in and their own interests above the user experience. If even someone as knowledgeable about this subject as Brown, who writes actual software to make these things work, is advising against using passkeys, you know something&#8217;s gone horribly wrong. I also looked into possibly using passkeys, including using things like a Yubikey, but the process seems so complex and unpleasant that I, too, concluded just sticking to Bitwarden and my favourite open source TFA application was a far superior user experience.

## Gentoo bans use of “AI” tools

date: 2024-04-26, from: OS News

Gentoo, the venerable Linux distribution which in my headcanon I describe as &#8216;classy&#8217;, has banned any use of &#8220;AI&#8221;. A proposal by Gentoo Council member Michał Górny from February of this year banning its use has been unanimously accepted by the Gentoo Council. The new policy reads: It is expressly forbidden to contribute to Gentoo any content that has been created with the assistance of Natural Language Processing artificial intelligence tools. This motion can be revisited, should a case been made over such a tool that does not pose copyright, ethical and quality concerns. ↫ Michał Górny We&#8217;ll have to see how this policy will be implemented, but I like that Gentoo is willing to take a stand.

## Columbia University drops deadline for dismantling pro-Palestinian protest camp

date: 2024-04-26, from: VOA News USA

New York — Columbia University backed off late Thursday from an overnight deadline for pro-Palestinian protesters to abandon an encampment there as more college campuses in the United States sought to prevent occupations from taking hold.


Police have carried out large-scale arrests in universities across the country, at times using chemical irritants and tasers to disperse protests over Israel's war with Hamas.


The office of New York-based Columbia University President Minouche Shafik issued a statement at 11:07 p.m. (0307 GMT Friday) retreating from a midnight deadline to dismantle a large tent camp with around 200 students.


"The talks have shown progress and are continuing as planned," the statement said. "We have our demands; they have theirs."


The statement denied that New York City police were invited on the campus. "This rumor is false," it said.


A student, identifying herself only as Mimi, told AFP she had been at the camp for seven days.


"They call us terrorists, they call us violent. But the only tool we actually have are our voices," she said.


Student protesters say they are expressing solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, where the death toll has topped 34,305, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.


More than 200 people protesting the war were arrested Wednesday and early Thursday at universities in Los Angeles, Boston and Austin, Texas, where around 2,000 people gathered again Thursday.


Riot officers in the southern state of Georgia used chemical irritants and tasers to disperse protests at Emory University in Atlanta.


Photographs showed police wielding tasers as they wrestled with protesters on neatly manicured lawns.


The Atlanta Police Department said officers responding to the school's request for help were "met with violence" and used "chemical irritants" in their response.


The spreading protests began at Columbia University, which has remained the epicenter of the student protest movement.


Free speech?


The protests pose a major challenge to university administrators who are trying to balance campus commitments to free expression with complaints that the rallies have crossed a line.


Pro-Israel supporters and others worried about campus safety have pointed to antisemitic incidents and allege that campuses are encouraging intimidation and hate speech.


"I've never felt more scared to be a Jew in America right now," said Skyler Sieradsky, a 21-year-old student of philosophy and political science at George Washington University.


"There are students and faculty standing by messages of hate, and standing by messages that call for violence."


Demonstrators, who include a number of Jewish students, have disavowed antisemitism and criticized officials equating it with opposition to Israel.


"People are here in support of Palestinian people from all different backgrounds... (compelled by) their general sense of justice," a 33-year-old graduate student at the University of Texas, Austin, who said he was Jewish and gave his name as Josh, told AFP. 


U.S. ally Israel launched its war in Gaza after the Hamas attack on October 7 that left around 1,170 people dead, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.


Hamas militants also took roughly 250 people hostage. Israel estimates 129 remain in Gaza, including 34 presumed dead.


Coast to coast


At the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, 93 people were arrested for trespassing on Wednesday, authorities said they were canceling events at the May 10 graduation ceremony.


The ceremony, which usually attracts 65,000 people, made headlines this month when administrators canceled a planned speech by a top student after complaints from Jewish groups that she had links to antisemitic groups. She denied the charge.


At Emerson College in Boston, local media reported classes were canceled Thursday after police clashed with protesters overnight, tearing down a pro-Palestinian encampment and arresting 108 people.


In Washington, students from Georgetown and George Washington University (GW) established a solidarity encampment on the GW campus Thursday.


Protests and encampments have also sprung up at New York University and Yale -- both of which also saw dozens of students arrested earlier this week -- Harvard, Brown University, MIT, the University of Michigan and elsewhere.


California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt said its campus could remain closed into next week due to protesters occupying buildings.


On Sunday, U.S. President Joe Biden denounced "blatant antisemitism" that has "no place on college campuses."


But the White House has also said the president supports freedom of expression at U.S. universities.

## Ukraine pulls US-provided Abrams tanks from front lines over Russian drone threats

date: 2024-04-26, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — Ukraine has sidelined U.S.-provided Abrams M1A1 battle tanks for now in its fight against Russia, in part because Russian drone warfare has made it too difficult for them to operate without detection or coming under attack, two U.S. military officials told The Associated Press.


The U.S. agreed to send 31 Abrams to Ukraine in January 2023 after an aggressive monthslong campaign by Kyiv arguing that the tanks, which cost about $10 million apiece, were vital to its ability to breach Russian lines.


But the battlefield has changed substantially since then, notably by the ubiquitous use of Russian surveillance drones and hunter-killer drones. Those weapons have made it more difficult for Ukraine to protect the tanks when they are quickly detected and hunted by Russian drones or rounds.


Five of the 31 tanks have already been lost to Russian attacks.


The proliferation of drones on the Ukrainian battlefield means “there isn’t open ground that you can just drive across without fear of detection,” a senior defense official told reporters Thursday.


The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide an update on U.S. weapons support for Ukraine before Friday's Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting.


For now, the tanks have been moved from the front lines, and the U.S. will work with the Ukrainians to reset tactics, said Joint Chiefs of Staff Vice Chairman Adm. Christopher Grady and a third defense official who confirmed the move on the condition of anonymity.


"When you think about the way the fight has evolved, massed armor in an environment where unmanned aerial systems are ubiquitous can be at risk," Grady told the AP in an interview this week, adding that tanks are still important.




"Now, there is a way to do it," he said. "We’ll work with our Ukrainian partners, and other partners on the ground, to help them think through how they might use that, in that kind of changed environment now, where everything is seen immediately."


News of the sidelined tanks comes as the U.S. marks the two-year anniversary of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, a coalition of about 50 countries that meets monthly to assess Ukraine's battlefield needs and identify where to find needed ammunition, weapons or maintenance to keep Ukraine's troops equipped.


Recent aid packages, including the $1 billion military assistance package signed by President Joe Biden on Wednesday, also reflect a wider reset for Ukrainian forces in the evolving fight.


The U.S. is expected to announce Friday that it also will provide about $6 billion in long-term military aid to Ukraine, U.S. officials said, adding that it will include much sought after munitions for Patriot air defense systems. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet made public.


The $1 billion package emphasized counter-drone capabilities, including .50-caliber rounds specifically modified to counter drone systems; additional air defenses and ammunition; and a host of alternative, and cheaper, vehicles, including Humvees, Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles and Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles.


The U.S. also confirmed for the first time that it is providing long-range ballistic missiles known as ATACMs, which allow Ukraine to strike deep into Russian-occupied areas without having to advance and be further exposed to either drone detection or fortified Russian defenses.


While drones are a significant threat, the Ukrainians also have not adopted tactics that could have made the tanks more effective, one of the U.S. defense officials said.


After announcing it would provide Ukraine the Abrams tanks in January 2023, the U.S. began training Ukrainians at Grafenwoehr Army base in Germany that spring on how to maintain and operate them. They also taught the Ukrainians how to use them in combined arms warfare — where the tanks operate as part of a system of advancing armored forces, coordinating movements with overhead offensive fires, infantry troops and air assets.


As the spring progressed and Ukraine's highly anticipated counteroffensive stalled, shifting from tank training in Germany to getting Abrams on the battlefield was seen as an imperative to breach fortified Russian lines. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced on his Telegram channel in September that the Abrams had arrived in Ukraine.


Since then, however, Ukraine has only employed them in a limited fashion and has not made combined arms warfare part of its operations, the defense official said.


During its recent withdrawal from Avdiivka, a city in eastern Ukraine that was the focus of intense fighting for months, several tanks were lost to Russian attacks, the official said.


A long delay by Congress in passing new funding for Ukraine meant its forces had to ration ammunition, and in some cases they were only able to shoot back once for every five or more times they were targeted by Russian forces.


In Avdiivka, Ukrainian forces were badly outgunned and fighting back against Russian glide bombs and hunter-killer drones with whatever ammunition they had left.

## China skips red-carpet welcome for Blinken, whose visit prompts cynicism

date: 2024-04-26, from: VOA News USA

washington — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's arrival in China on Wednesday has been met with skepticism, cynicism and suggestions that the absence of a red carpet for the top U.S. diplomat's arrival was a not-so-subtle message from Beijing.


Blinken kicked off his three-day visit to China in Shanghai with online commenters and analysts noting China had omitted the usual practice of laying out a red carpet for a distinguished visitor.


Posting on X, Hu Xijin, a former editor-in-chief of Chinese state media Global Times, said, "Blinken has arrived in Shanghai, China. Many people noticed when he stepped off the plane that there seemed to be no red carpet on the ground. His China visit should be seen as an 'imploring' one, although the U.S. made some tough public opinion preparations in advance."




Gordon Chang, a distinguished senior fellow at the New York-based Gatestone Institute think tank, responded to Hu Xijin's post, "#China, before #Blinken even stepped off his plane in #Shanghai today, insulted him."


An X user under the name Lord Bebo, who claims to be anti-mainstream media, posted, "Blinken arrives in China and is met WITHOUT RED CARPET. No band or anything … he's welcomed like a somebody unimportant." His post received more than 10,000 likes.


U.S.-China relations have eased since the two sides resumed high-level contacts, but many differences remain.


Before Blinken's visit, U.S. media reported that the U.S. discussed sanctioning some Chinese banks to counter their support for Russia. Blinken also stated in releasing the State Department's 2023 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices that the Uyghurs in Xinjiang are victims of genocide and crimes against humanity.


He arrived in China the same day President Joe Biden signed a bill into law that includes Taiwan military aid and pushes TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations.


"What an awkward moment for Blinken as he lands in China," Canadian geopolitics expert Abishur Prakash said. "The U.S. is full-steam ahead on taking on China, led by the bills around TikTok, Taiwan and support nations in the Indo-Pacific against Beijing."


'Face-to-face diplomacy matters'


On his day of arrival, Blinken posted a video speech against a backdrop of Shanghai's iconic buildings, such as the neon-lit Oriental Pearl Tower and the Shanghai World Financial Center.


"We just arrived here in Shanghai in the People's Republic of China to work on issues that matter to the American people," he said in the video. "One of those is fentanyl, synthetic opioids, the leading killer of Americans between the ages of 18 and 49.


"President [Joe] Biden, President Xi [Jinping], when they met in San Francisco at the end of last year, agreed to cooperate to help prevent fentanyl and the ingredients that make it from getting to the United States. We will be working on that."


Blinken said he would be talking not only to his counterparts in the Chinese government, but also to students, academics, business leaders and "the people who are building bridges and ties between our countries.


"And of course, we will be dealing with areas where we have real differences with China, dealing with them directly, communicating clearly. Face-to-face diplomacy matters," he said. "It's important to avoid miscommunications, misperceptions, and to advance the interests of the American people."


Reaction takes anti-American tone


On Chinese social media, Blinken's overtures were met with cynicism.


On Weibo, China's largest social platform, Blinken's second visit to China had limited coverage, and the discussion was dominated by an anti-American tone.


A Weibo user under the name of Xiao Fan Hao She argued that the United States has not officially listed all fentanyl-like substances on the control list.


"We ask whether the United States believes that it can solve the domestic problems in the United States by shifting the blame externally, shirking responsibility, and smearing China's image," she wrote.


A Weibo user under the name of An Hao Xin said, "Coming with him is also the bargaining chip of 'bank sanctions.' To be honest, if you want to kick SWIFT out, just do it quickly. Why are you hesitating?"


Another commenter said, "If you dare to overturn the table, then we just aid Russia with weapons and see who suffers."


Kenneth Roth, a former executive director of Human Rights Watch and visiting professor at Princeton University, linked the visit to U.S. Middle East policy, saying on X that Blinken "would have an easier time telling the Chinese government not to provide military supplies to Russia as it commits war crimes in Ukraine if the U.S. government were not arming Israel as it commits war crimes in Gaza."


But Roth also said, "It will be shameful if Blinken is so determined to make nice to Beijing that he doesn't publicly mention its crimes against humanity targeting Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang."


Jonathan Cheng, the China bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal, said on X, "Unnamed Chinese official to Blinken: 'Perception is always the first button that must be put right. Whether China and the United States are rivals or partners is a fundamental issue, on which there must not be any catastrophic mistake.' "


Adrianna Zhang contributed to this report.

## This year's call for expressions of interest to join our board

date: 2024-04-26, from: Crossref Blog

<p>The Crossref Nominating Committee is inviting expressions of interest to join the Board of Directors of Crossref for the term starting in January 2025. The committee will gather responses from those interested and create the slate of candidates that our membership will vote on in an election in September.</p>
<p><strong>Expressions of interest will be due Monday, May 27th, 2024</strong></p>
<p>This is an exciting time to join the board, as we have a number of active projects underway: We are considering resourcing Crossref for a sustainable future and board members will be part of deciding any changes to our fees scheme and overseeing its implementation. We&rsquo;re focusing on how our community and metadata can contribute to ensuring the integrity of the scholarly record. We’re broadening our metadata record to capture richer funding and institutional affiliations. We&rsquo;re working towards a future where the scholarly record prioritizes relationships between research outputs to build a holistic research nexus. The board helps guide this work.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-board-elections">About the board elections</h3>
<p>The board is elected through the “one member, one vote” policy wherein every member organization of Crossref has a single vote to elect representatives to the Crossref board. Board terms are for three years, and this year, there are four seats open for election.</p>
<p>The board maintains a balance of seats, with eight seats for smaller members and eight seats for larger members (based on total revenue to Crossref). This is an effort to ensure that the scholarly community&rsquo;s diversity of experiences and perspectives is represented in decisions made at Crossref.</p>
<p>This year, we will elect two of the larger member seats (membership tiers $3,900 and above) and two of the smaller member seats (membership tiers $1,650 and below). You don’t need to specify which seat you are applying for; we will provide that information to the nominating committee.</p>
<p>The online election will open in September, with results announced at the annual meeting on October 29th, 2024. New members will begin their term in January 2025.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-nominating-committee">About the Nominating Committee</h3>
<p>The Nominating Committee reviews the expressions of interest and selects a slate of candidates for election. The slate put forward will exceed the total number of open seats. The committee considers the statements of interest, organizational size, geography, and experience.</p>
<p>2024 Nominating Committee</p>
<ul>
<li>James Phillpotts*, Director of Content Transformation and Standards, Oxford University Press, committee chair</li>
<li>Oscar Donde*, Editor in Chief, Pan Africa Science Journal</li>
<li>Rose L’Huillier*, Senior Vice President Researcher Products, Elsevier</li>
<li>Ivy Mutambanengwe-Matanga, Chief Operating Officer, African Journals Online</li>
<li>Adam Sewell, Chief Technology Officer, IOP Publishing</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-is-the-committee-looking-for-this-year">What is the committee looking for this year</h3>
<p>The committee looks for skills and experience that will complement the rest of the board. Candidates from countries and regions not currently reflected on the board are strongly encouraged to apply. Successful candidates often have some or all of these characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate a commitment to or understanding of our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/strategy/" target="_blank">strategic agenda</a> or the <a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/" target="_blank">Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure</a>;</li>
<li>Have expertise that may be underrepresented on the board currently;</li>
<li>Hold senior/director-level positions in their organizations;</li>
<li>Have experience with governance or community involvement;</li>
<li>Represent member organizations that are active in the scholarly communications ecosystem;</li>
<li>Demonstrate metadata best practices as shown in the member’s <a href="https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/" target="_blank">participation report</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The board is also encouraging Crossref members who are research funders to apply.</p>
<h3 id="board-roles-and-responsibilities">Board roles and responsibilities</h3>
<p>Crossref’s services provide a central infrastructure for scholarly communications. Crossref’s board helps shape the future of our services and by extension, impacts the broader scholarly ecosystem. We are looking for board members to contribute their experience and perspective.</p>
<p>The role of the board at Crossref is to provide strategic and financial oversight of the organization, as well as guidance to the Executive Director and the staff leadership team, with the key responsibilities being:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting the strategic direction for the organization;</li>
<li>Providing financial oversight; and</li>
<li>Approving new policies and services.</li>
</ul>
<p>The board is representative of our membership base and guides the staff leadership team on trends affecting scholarly communications. The board sets strategic directions for the organization while also providing oversight into policy changes and implementation. Board members have a fiduciary responsibility to ensure sound operations. They do this by attending board meetings as well as joining more specific board committees.</p>
<h3 id="who-can-apply-to-join-the-board">Who can apply to join the board?</h3>
<p>Any active member of Crossref can apply to join the board. Crossref membership is open to organizations that produce content, such as academic presses, commercial publishers, standards organizations, and research funders.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-expected-of-board-members">What is expected of board members?</h3>
<p>Board members attend four meetings each year that typically take place in January, March, July, and November. Meetings have taken place in a variety of international locations and travel support is provided when needed. January, March, and November board meetings are held virtually, and all committee meetings take place virtually. Each board member should sit on at least one Crossref committee. Care is taken to accommodate the wide range of time zones in which our board members live.</p>
<p>While the expressions of interest are specific to an individual, the seat that is elected to the board belongs to the member organization. The primary board member also names an alternate who may attend meetings in the event that the primary board member is unable to. There is no personal financial obligation to sit on the board. The member organization must remain in good standing.</p>
<p>Board members are expected to be comfortable assuming the responsibilities listed above and to prepare and participate in board meeting discussions.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-apply">How to apply</h3>

## CloudNativePG 1.23.0, 1.22.3 and 1.21.5 Released!

date: 2024-04-26, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>The <strong>CloudNativePG Community</strong> is excited to announce the release of version
1.23.0 of the <strong>CloudNativePG Operator</strong>!</p>
<p>This release brings a host of new features and enhancements, including support
for PostgreSQL image catalogs, synchronization of user-defined replication
slots, and Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) configuration.</p>
<p>We've revised our Community support to enhance our focus and optimize resources.
The supported versions will be the last minor, plus the previous minor, which will be
supported for three months once the new minor is out.
This is in effect adding two more months of support to the outgoing minor over
what we used to have.</p>
<h2>What's New in 1.23</h2>
<h3>PostgreSQL Image Catalogs</h3>
<p>Say goodbye to PostgreSQL version management headaches! With image catalogs
based on major versions, managing your database fleet has never been easier.
Simply request the PostgreSQL major version you need and control how your
databases stay up-to-date. We've introduced two new resources
(<code>ClusterImageCatalog</code> and <code>ImageCatalog</code>) and a new stanza
(<code>spec.imageCatalogRef</code>), setting the stage for simpler management of default images.
The Community will provide catalogs, and you could also use third-party ones,
or even build your own.</p>
<h3>Synchronization of User-Defined Replication Slots</h3>
<p>Ensure seamless failover with extended physical replication slot
synchronization, now covering persistence of user-defined slots after failover.</p>
<h3>Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) Configuration</h3>
<p>Customize PDB settings with the new <code>.spec.enablePDB</code> field. Disable PDBs
on primary instances for single-instance deployments, ensuring smooth pod
eviction during maintenance operations. This marks our first step towards
deprecating the node maintenance window feature.</p>
<h2>Upgrade and Maintenance</h2>
<p>Before upgrading, carefully review the
<a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/current/installation_upgrade/#upgrading-to-1230-1223-or-1215">detailed instructions</a>.
New patch releases are now available for all supported versions, including
1.22.3 and 1.21.5.</p>
<p>We recommend upgrading to CloudNativePG 1.23.0 at your earliest convenience.
Alternatively, update to the latest patch version within your current minor
release.</p>
<h2>End of Life Announcement</h2>
<p>With the release of 1.23.0, the 1.21.x minor version will reach its <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.23/supported_releases/#support-status-of-cloudnativepg-releases">end of
life</a>
on May 24, 2024. Plan your upgrade to ensure continued support and
security.</p>
<h2>Join the Community</h2>

## Air Quality Data for the Rich

date: 2024-04-25, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjEwNzY5OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MzAxMjg4Nn0.IOccybyzUjwdjSgXpc09DG7nz64dILNET5F6uVcrzzs/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>
	Everyone loves a public good, and one of the classic examples is clean air. When I breathe in clean air, no one else gets any less of it, and you can’t exclude people from enjoying it. 
</p><p>
	But how do we know whether the air we’re breathing is clean? And is that information a public good?
</p><p>
	A team of economists from universities across the U.S. published some answers to those questions this week in a <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32356" target="_blank">working paper</a> via the National Bureau of Economic Research.<br/>
</p><p>
	As their research subject, the economists looked at PurpleAir, which promises more localized and frequently updated air quality readings beyond what the Environmental Protection Agency can provide. Once purchased (for a <a href="https://www2.purpleair.com/products/list" target="_blank">price</a> of $229 to $339, depending on the model) and installed, the censors report their air quality readings to a map that anyone can access. The company’s sales took off in 2020 after the epochal <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-14/mapping-the-wildfire-smoke-choking-the-western-u-s" target="_blank"><u>wildfires up and down the West Coast</u></a>.
</p><p>
	The study considered air quality readings from PurpleAir monitors in California from 2019 to 2021, including the fires and the consumer response to them. Then the researchers matched those readings with census tracts and the demographic information associated with them.
</p><p>
	What they found is that PurpleAir monitors tend to be “clustered” within certain geographic areas, and that those geographic areas tend to be wealthier. Not surprisingly, pricey air monitors have a customer base demographically similar to that of other gadgets bought by early adopters. In other words, PurpleAir monitors’ locations don't so much track pollution levels as demographics.
</p><p>
<span></span>On Thursday afternoon, the PurpleAir map showed 15 outdoor sensors in and around Bakersfield, California, a majority Hispanic city of 400,000 people in California’s Central Valley that the American Lung Association ranks as <a href="https://www.lung.org/research/sota/city-rankings/most-polluted-cities" target="_blank"><u>either the most or the third most polluted American city</u></a>, depending on the metric. There were 13 active, meanwhile, in the famously ritzy San Francisco neighborhood of Pacific Heights, with a population of around 20,000. (We reached out for comment to both the researchers and PurpleAir but hadn’t gotten a response from either as of press time.)</p><p>
	Of course, the relationship between income and pollution is not random — quite the opposite. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39797-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>On the global</u></a> and <a href="https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~rcarson/papers/USKuznets.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>national levels</u></a>, there is an inverse relationship between air pollution and income, with <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add0285" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>people in low income areas more exposed to harmful pollution</u></a>.
</p><p>
	While the economists called their finding “unsurprising,” they also said it raised the concern that the monitors “may actually increase health inequalities” by allowing people in better-covered areas to “improve their health through avoidance behavior,” thus making it so “the benefit from these monitors are more likely to accrue to the higher income individuals that adopted them.” Since PurpleAir monitors “are more present in less polluted areas,” the data they collect has less “social value … since the places that would benefit the most from information that could encourage pollution avoidance behavior are precisely the ones least likely to have this information.”
</p><p>
	This means that “in areas where pollution is the highest, and thus avoidance behaviors are potentially the most effective, people have less knowledge of their pollution levels, even when conditioning on income and education.”
</p><p>
<span></span>The researchers found similar correlations of PurpleAir monitor usage and race, with “monitor adoption … lowest in areas with a higher share of Black or Hispanic populations.”
</p><p>
	These findings also mean that the people spending money to learn about the air quality where they live are <em>also</em> getting very little value from their monitors, as they are both less likely to live in a heavily polluted area and more likely to be well served by existing air monitors. In the slightly bloodless language of academic economics, the authors wrote, “Technophiles may purchase monitors for reasons that are quasi-independent from the value of information that the monitor provides, including a competitive desire to ‘keep up with the Joneses’ and thus drive high levels of spatial correlation in monitor adoption.” If people are getting PurpleAir monitors because their neighbors are, it’s probably a sign that they don’t need one. </p><p>For the public to truly realize the promise of more particularized and frequently updated public health data, collection can’t merely be left up to the vagaries and patterns of the consumer electronics market. An “optimal” policy, according to the researchers, “will require supplemental provision of monitors where the private market falls short” — or to put it more bluntly, government action. Public health will have to be public.<br/></p>

## US official announces business partnership with Kenya

date: 2024-04-25, from: VOA News USA

nairobi, kenya — About 1,300 delegates and 400 companies participated in the fourth American Chamber of Commerce summit in Nairobi, Kenya, where Kenya's president William Ruto says his country is ready for business — and means business.


"The 2024 summit's theme — catalyzing the future of U.S. East Africa Trade and Investment intentionally — draws on the previous edition to develop a strategic platform for commercial advocacy, which will strengthen bilateral trade between Kenya and the U.S., as well as between our region and the U.S.," said Ruto.


U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo participated in this year's summit — which ended Thursday — saying it's not enough to state the intentions of the United States to invest more and collaborate with Kenya.


"You also have to show up and that's why I am here," she said. "And when we show up, we also have to listen and learn.''


Raimondo announces US-Kenya partnership 


In her first official trip to East Africa, Raimondo reiterated President Joe Biden's December 2022 message that the U.S. is all-in on Africa. To that end, she said she traveled with 14 members of the President's Advisory Council on doing business in Africa.


"Africa has changed the narrative and the companies that are here today know that," said Raimondo. "And they reflect the optimism and the commitment from the U.S. business community about the opportunities in Kenya and across the continent."


Raimondo also announced a partnership "to harness artificial intelligence, facilitate data flows and empower digital upskilling with Kenya."


The partnership, she said, is the first of its kind with an African nation to promote the safe development and deployment of AI. In addition, seven private-sector deals on digital transformation and commitments were made involving companies including the NBA, CISCO, Pfizer, and Qualcomm.


Two new grants by the U.S. Trade and Development Agency were announced to expand semiconductor fabrication in Kenya and the construction of a fiber network along the railways.


Rebecca Miano, Kenya's cabinet secretary with the Ministry of Investments, Trade, and Industry, told participants that Kenya should be a destination for investors and not only because of its young, educated and innovative workforce.


"We also have a green story: decarbonizing the world," Miano said. "Kenya is a key player."


Miano said that up to 95 percent of the electricity consumed in Kenya is renewable.


"We have a target to make it 100% in the next few years," she said.


Summit explores tech, climate, energy


The two-day AmCham summit brought together businesses to stimulate commercial opportunities, said Maxwell Okello, CEO of AmCham Kenya.


This year's summit focused on key areas such as the tech space, climate action and green energy, said Okello.


"I am sure you've walked around and seen the pavilion under the title 'Digital Transformation Africa,' which brings together technology ecosystems both Kenyan but American as well," said Okello. "Secondly, we have shone the light on ... matters related to climate action and green business because we know we need to be green as we are moving forward."


Out of 400 companies at the event, Wandia Gichuru, CEO of Vivo Fashion Group, got a special shout-out from U.S. Ambassador to Kenya Meg Whitman, who said she was wearing a top made by Gichuru's apparel company.


"We were very excited, not only she was wearing something Vivo, but she also made the announcement that we would be opening our very first U.S. store in Atlanta this May," said Gichuru. "... and we hope that the ambassador and our president will visit the store while they are in the U.S. for the state visit in May."


President Ruto is set to visit the United States next month in the first state visit since he was elected.

## Biden grants $6 billion to Micron to boost chip production

date: 2024-04-25, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden was in Syracuse, New York, Thursday to tout a deal to provide memory chip maker Micron Technology with $6.1 billion in federal grants to support the firm in building factories in the states of New York and Idaho.


“We're bringing advanced chip manufacturing back to America after 40 years,” Biden said Thursday. He said the funding, paired with a $125 billion investment from Micron, represents the “single biggest private investment ever in history of these two states.”


The investment will support the construction of two plants in Clay, a suburb of Syracuse, New York, and one in Boise, Idaho. The grant will unleash “$50 billion in private investment by 2030 as the first step towards Micron’s investment of up to $125 billion across both states over the next two decades,” the White House said in a statement.


The deal was announced last week by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, who personally lobbied Micron to invest in his state. It’s the latest in a series of awards given by the administration, intended to shore up domestic production of advanced semiconductors using funds from the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. The aim is to boost domestic manufacturing and reduce reliance on chip supplies from China and Taiwan.


This investment will “supercharge Micron to build the most advanced memory chip factory in the world, Schumer said Thursday. “America's future will be built in Syracuse, not in Shanghai.”


The administration recently awarded Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductor, Intel, GlobalFoundries, Microchip Technology, and BAE Systems, more than $29 billion in federal grants for chipmaking investments. It’s part of an effort to catch up in the global semiconductor manufacturing race currently dominated by China, Taiwan and South Korea.


The U.S. share of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity has decreased from 37% in 1990 to 12% today, largely because other governments have offered manufacturing incentives and invested in research to strengthen domestic chipmaking capabilities, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.


To address such stiff foreign competition, the $280 billion bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act offers $52 billion in incentives for domestic semiconductor production and research, as well as an investment tax credit for semiconductor manufacturing.


Manufacturing revival


The announcements are part of the economic vision the president is offering to voters in his re-election bid – that he is working to create a manufacturing revival in the country, including in Republican-controlled districts such as where the Micron plant will be located.


“Micron’s total investment will be the largest private investment in New York and Idaho’s history, and will create over 70,000 jobs, including 20,000 direct construction and manufacturing jobs and tens of thousands of indirect jobs,” the White House said.


Ahead of the November presidential election, Biden’s strategy appears to be to announce investments in manufacturing facilities in Georgia, Idaho, North Carolina and Ohio, states where Democrats lack a strong foothold.


It is not clear whether the approach will succeed as voters will not immediately feel the effects. The initial phase of the Micron project, for example, would see the first plant opened in 2028 and the second in 2029.


Meanwhile, voters are concerned about high inflation, and dislike Biden’s economic job performance. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll shows 34% of respondents approving of Biden’s approach on the economy, compared to 41% who favor the approach of former president Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.


Still, Biden’s trip to New York is an opportunity for him to celebrate another victory following a string of good news for the president. On Wednesday, he secured the endorsement of the North America’s Building Trades Unions and signed a $95.3 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan after months of congressional gridlock.

## Ubuntu 24.04 LTS released

date: 2024-04-25, from: OS News

It wasn&#8217;t too long ago that new Ubuntu releases were major happenings in the Linux world, as it was the default Linux distribution for many, both old and newcomers, in the desktop Linux space. These days, Ubuntu release hit a little different, with Canonical&#8217;s focus having shifted much more to the enterprise, and several aspects of the distribution being decidedly unpopular, like the snap package management system. Still, Ubuntu is probably still one of the most popular, if not the most popular, distributions out there, so any new release, like today&#8217;s Ubuntu 24.0 LTS, is still a big deal. Ubuntu Desktop brings the Subiquity installer to an LTS for the first time. In addition to a refreshed user experience and a minimal install by default, the installer now includes experimental support for ZFS and TPM-based full disk encryption and the ability to import auto-install configurations. Post install, users will be greeted with the latest GNOME 46 alongside a new App Center and firmware-updater. Netplan is now the default for networking configuration and supports bidirectionality with NetworkManager. ↫ Utkarsh Gupta on ubuntu-announce Of course, all the various other Ubuntu editions have also seen new releases: Edubuntu, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu Budgie, Ubuntu Cinnamon, Ubuntu Kylin, Ubuntu MATE, Ubuntu Studio, Ubuntu Unity, and Xubuntu. Yes, that&#8217;s a long list. They all mostly share the same improvements as Ubuntu&#8217;s main course, but paired with the latest versions of the respective desktop environments instead. Except for Kubuntu. Unlike just about any other major distribution released over the last few months, such as Fedora 40 only a few days ago, Kubuntu does not ship with the new KDE Plasma 6, opting for Plasma 5.27.11 instead. There simply wasn&#8217;t enough time between the release of Plasma 6 and the Ubuntu feature freeze, so they made the &#8211; in my opinion &#8211; understandable call to stick to Plasma 5 for now, moving Plasma 6 to the next release later this year.

## US communications regulator restores net neutrality annulled under Trump

date: 2024-04-25, from: VOA News USA

washington — The U.S. Federal Communications Commission voted 3-2 on Thursday to reinstate landmark net neutrality rules and reassume regulatory oversight of broadband internet rescinded under former President Donald Trump. 


The commission voted along party lines to finalize a proposal first advanced in October to reinstate open internet rules adopted in 2015 and re-establish the commission's broadband authority. 


FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said the agency "believes every consumer deserves internet access that is fast, open, and fair." 


"The last FCC threw this authority away and decided broadband needed no supervision," she said. 


Net neutrality refers to the principle that internet service providers should enable access to all content and applications regardless of the source, and without favoring or blocking particular products or websites. 


The FCC said it was also using its authority to order the U.S. units of China Telecom, China Unicom and China Mobile to discontinue broadband internet access services in the United States.  


Rosenworcel noted the FCC has taken similar actions against Chinese telecom companies in the past using existing authority. 


Reinstating the net neutrality rules has been a priority for President Joe Biden, who signed a July 2021 executive order encouraging the FCC to reinstate net neutrality rules adopted under Democratic President Barack Obama. 


Democrats were stymied for nearly three years because they did not take majority control of the five-member FCC until October. 


Under Trump, the FCC had argued the net neutrality rules were unnecessary, blocked innovation and resulted in a decline in network investment by internet service providers, a contention disputed by Democrats. 


The U.S. Chamber of Commerce criticized the FCC action saying it was "imposing a flawed, pre-television era regulatory structure on broadband" and "will only deter the investments and innovation necessary to connect all Americans." 


Public interest group Free Press said the vote is a "major victory for the public interest" saying it "empowers the FCC to hold companies like AT&T, Comcast, Spectrum and Verizon accountable for a wide range of harms to internet users across the United States." 


A group of Republican lawmakers, including House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Senator Ted Cruz, called the plan "an illegal power grab that would expose the broadband industry to an oppressive regulatory regime" giving the agency and states power to impose rate regulation, unbundle obligations and tax broadband internet providers. 


Democrats on the FCC say they will not set rate regulations. 


The Computer & Communications Industry Association, whose members include Amazon.com, Apple, Alphabet and Meta Platforms, back net neutrality, arguing the rules "must be reinstated to preserve open access to the internet." 


USTelecom, whose members include AT&T, Verizon and others, called reinstating net neutrality "entirely counterproductive, unnecessary, and an anti-consumer regulatory distraction." 


Despite the 2017 decision to withdraw the requirement at the federal level, a dozen states now have net neutrality laws or regulations in place. Industry groups abandoned legal challenges to those state requirements in May 2022.

## Supreme Court considers Trump's claim of criminal immunity

date: 2024-04-25, from: VOA News USA

washington — The Supreme Court on Thursday appeared skeptical of former President Donald Trump's claim that he enjoys absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts he took while in office, but several justices expressed doubts about the details of charges brought against him in a pending federal trial.


Trump faces criminal charges in four jurisdictions in the United States, but the case at issue on Thursday was his federal indictment on charges that as part of his effort to overturn President Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election, he committed fraud against the United States, attempted to obstruct an official government proceeding, and illegally pressured public officials to help him block certification of the election results. 


While the former president would clearly prefer a ruling that agrees with his claims of blanket immunity from criminal prosecution, a decision that significantly delays the progress of his criminal trial could benefit him as well, by pushing resolution of the case past the presidential elections in November.


Should Trump win the presidency again, it would be within his power to direct the Department of Justice to drop the case against him.


Opposing arguments


The basis of Thursday's hearing was a request by Trump that the high court review a unanimous appeals court decision that rejected his claim of absolute immunity out of hand.


Attorney D. John Sauer, representing Trump, took the position that presidential immunity from criminal prosecution has, in fact, always existed, and argued that without it, a president would be unable to take decisive action while in office.


"Without presidential immunity from criminal prosecution, there can be no presidency as we know it," Sauer said.


"If a president can be charged, put on trial and imprisoned for his most controversial decisions the moment he leaves office, that looming threat will distort the president's decision-making precisely when bold and fearless action is most needed," he said. "Every current president will face de facto blackmail and extortion by his political rivals while he is still in office."


Making the case for the government, attorney Michael Dreeben pointed out that despite Trump's claims, the courts have never recognized the existence of absolute immunity from criminal prosecution and warned of the potential consequences of doing so.


"His novel theory would immunize former presidents for criminal liability for bribery, treason, sedition, murder and here — conspiring to use fraud to overturn the results of an election and perpetuate himself in power," Dreeben said.


"Such presidential immunity has no foundation in the Constitution," he said. "The framers knew too well the dangers of a king who could do no wrong. They therefore devised a system to check abuses of power, especially the use of official power for private gain." 


'Official acts' 


Much of the discussion during the nearly three-hour hearing focused on what constitutes "official acts" by the president.


Early on, Chief Justice John Roberts pointed out the difficulty in drawing that distinction, presenting a hypothetical case in which a president accepts a bribe in return for nominating a particular person to an ambassadorship.


"Accepting the bribe isn't an official act, but appointing an ambassador is certainly within the official responsibilities of the president," Roberts said, asking the president's attorney how he would propose drawing the distinction.


Sauer, under questioning from several justices, insisted that presidents enjoy broad immunity from prosecution for official acts, even when prosecutors believe they can demonstrate that the official act was taken for personal benefit.


"That's a situation which, of course, could be alleged in any indictment," he argued.


Several of the conservative-leaning justices on the court appeared willing to consider at least some degree of presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts, if not the absolute variety claimed by Trump.


"You believe that immunity from criminal prosecution is essential for the proper functioning of the presidency," said Justice Samuel Alito. "But my question is whether the very robust form of immunity that you're advocating is really necessary in order to achieve that result."


Other conservatives on the court, including Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, both Trump appointees, also seemed willing to consider at least some sort of limited immunity from criminal prosecution for presidents.


Liberal justices weigh in


Justice Elena Kagan, one of the court's liberal-leaning members, expressed incredulity at the idea that the Constitution should be read as placing a president beyond the reach of the criminal law.


"The framers did not put an immunity clause into the Constitution," she said. "They knew how to; there were immunity clauses in some state constitutions. They knew how to give legislative immunity. They didn't provide immunity to the president."


The reason, she said, was that the government of the United States was founded in reaction against the monarchy in the United Kingdom.


"They were reacting against a monarch who claimed to be above the law," she said. "Wasn't the whole point that the president was not a monarch, and the president was not supposed to be above the law?"


Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, a Biden appointee and the court's newest member, expressed concern about the impact of agreeing to Trump's claims of absolute immunity.


"If the potential for criminal liability is taken off the table, wouldn't there be significant risk that future presidents would be emboldened to commit crimes with abandon while they are in office?" Jackson asked.


Possible changes


While it is not possible to know how the court will rule, Thursday's hearing suggested that there are several conservative justices — perhaps enough to constitute a five-vote majority — who are open to requiring at least some changes to the way the government has charged the case.


That could include restricting the actions for which Trump can be charged to those that are plainly outside the bounds of his official duties. Doing so would require the trial court to hear evidence and make a determination as to whether the various actions by Trump enumerated in the indictment constitute official or unofficial conduct.


Such a ruling would almost certainly create a sufficient delay in the progress of the case to ensure that no resolution is reached until after the election takes place in November, and possibly after the winner of the next election is sworn in as president in January 2025.


Trump in New York


Despite the stakes of Thursday's hearing, Trump was not in attendance at the Supreme Court. He was required to be in a different courtroom, in New York, where he is on trial for falsifying business records as part of an arrangement to guarantee the silence of an adult film actor who in 2016 claimed she had engaged in a sexual affair with Trump several years prior.


However, on Thursday morning, Trump addressed the question of his immunity claim in a series of posts on his social network, Truth Social.


"If a President does not have Immunity, the Opposing Party, during his/her term in Office, can extort and blackmail the President by saying that, "if you don't give us everything we want, we will Indict you for things you did while in Office," even if everything done was totally Legal and Appropriate," he wrote.


"That would be the end of the Presidency, and our Country, as we know it, and is just one of the many Traps there would be for a President without Presidential Immunity," he added.

## US judge upholds Trump's $83.3 million defamation loss, rejects new trial

date: 2024-04-25, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — A federal judge on Thursday rejected Donald Trump's bid to throw out an $83.3 million defamation verdict in favor of the writer E. Jean Carroll, who said the former U.S. president defamed her after she accused him of raping her decades ago.


U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan denied Trump's requests for a new trial, or to have the former Elle magazine advice columnist's case thrown out altogether.


He also dismissed arguments that the jury's award to Carroll following Trump's "malicious and unceasing attacks" was too high, and that errors at the civil trial tainted the verdict.


Trump is appealing the verdict and plans to appeal Thursday's decision.


"We categorically disagree with Judge Kaplan's decision," his lawyer Alina Habba said in a statement. "It ignores long-standing constitutional principles and is a prime example of the lawfare raging across this country."


Roberta Kaplan, a lawyer for Carroll, said she was not surprised by the decision, and said the $83.3 million award was "entirely reasonable." She is not related to the judge.


Trump is the Republican presidential candidate in the 2024 election, and also a defendant in four criminal cases, including an ongoing hush money trial.


In the Jan. 26 verdict, jurors agreed with Carroll that Trump defamed her in June 2019 by denying that he had raped her in the mid-1990s in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in Manhattan.


Jurors awarded Carroll $18.3 million in compensatory damages for emotional and reputational harm, plus $65 million in punitive damages.


Trump's lawyers argued that the judge instructed jurors improperly about the burden of proof needed to show malice and erred in striking testimony about his state of mind.


According to the lawyers, Trump's testimony that "I just wanted to defend myself, my family, and frankly, the presidency" was relevant to whether he had acted maliciously, and that excluding it "all but assured" a big punitive damages award.


But the judge said Trump's attacks had been seen by more than 100 million people, and that Trump defamed Carroll with out-of-court statements even during the trial.


He also said Trump "put his hatred and disdain on full display" in the courtroom, including by muttering that the proceedings were a "witch hunt" and "con job," and walking out as Carroll's lawyer made her closing argument.


"On this exceptional record, the punitive damages evidence passes constitutional muster," Judge Kaplan wrote.


Last May, a different jury ordered Trump to pay Carroll $5 million over an October 2022 denial of Carroll's accusations, finding he had defamed and sexually abused her. Trump is also appealing that verdict.

## It’s Never Too Early to Start Thinking About COP

Which is how we wound up with yet another petrostate — <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop28-cop29-uae-azerbaijan-armenia" target="_self"><u>Azerbaijan</u></a> — as the host.</p>
<p>On Thursday at a climate conference in Berlin, Azerbaijan’s minister of ecology and natural resources and COP29’s President-Designate Mukhtar Babayev outlined his vision for the November get-together. “Our previous promises now need to be delivered, not re-interpreted. Fulfilled, not re-negotiated,” he told participants in the Petersberg Climate Dialogue, according to a transcript of his prepared remarks. “Everyone has a duty to make sure their actions match their words.”</p>
<p>And by actions, he means cash.</p>
<p>The first few days of last year’s conference saw nations attempting to outdo each other with headline-grabbing funding pledges, the delegates stopped short of adopting a comprehensive financing plan. That’s top of the priority list for 2024. In an interview with the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-united-nations-talks-negotiations-cop-1bf7aa6fb1b6d2aa6a601e35ba5a942c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Associated Press</em></em></u></a> in Washington, D.C., last week, Babayev said, “The agenda is to invite all the donors to at least increase their contribution for developing countries. Because with the climate change there, we are daily faced with all these impacts.”</p>
<p>Babayev (who was also, it should be noted, employed by the State Oil Company of the Republic of Azerbaijan for more than two decades) was in Washington for the spring meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and apparently found them uninspiring. “We know that the world needs to increase the overall flow of climate finance by several multiples,” he said in Berlin, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-25/cop29-climate-summit-countdown-starts-with-finance-at-forefront" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Bloomberg</em></em></u></a>. “While we heard a great deal of concern and worry, we did not yet see adequate and sufficient action.”</p>
<p>“Enable action” constitutes the second of the twin pillars Babayev outlined for COP29. The first, “enhance ambition,” has a handful of sub-pillars, including “ensuring all Parties receive the support they need to design and implement the next generation of” Nationally Determined Contributions, which parties to the Paris Agreement — a product of COP21 — submit every five years; adopting National Adaptation Plans by 2025; and filing Biennial Transparency Reports on their progress toward their stated goals.</p>
<p>In some ways, though, COP29 will be a mere prelude to the <em><em>really</em></em> big show: COP30, set for Belem, Brazil. That meeting will represent the 10th anniversary of the Paris COP. According to the UN, 2025 is also when global emissions must peak to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. According to Tom Evans of <a href="https://www.e3g.org/news/copenhagen-to-baku-first-steps-on-the-road-to-belem/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate consultancy E3G</u></a>, “With faith in the Paris Agreement on the line, what happens between now and Belem is vital for keeping multilateralism alive in a context of geopolitical turmoil and division.” </p><p>Belem was proposed as a host for COP30 way back at COP27 and formally selected in December of last year. Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, will have a comparatively slim 10 months to prepare. Surely it will all be fine, if only they can deal with the <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/cop28-dubai-schedule-badges" target="_self"><u>lines</u></a>.</p>

## US issues further sanctions on Iran, targets drones

date: 2024-04-25, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The United States on Thursday issued further sanctions on Iran, targeting Iranian drones, including their use by Russia in the war in Ukraine, as Washington seeks to ratchet up pressure on Tehran. 


In a statement, the U.S. Treasury Department said the action, taken in coordination with the United Kingdom and Canada, targets over one dozen entities, individuals and vessels it accused of playing a key role in facilitating and financing the clandestine sale of Iranian unmanned aerial vehicles to Iran's Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL). 


MODAFL in turn supports Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) and Russia's war in Ukraine, the Treasury said.


“Iran’s Ministry of Defense continues to destabilize the region and world with its support to Russia’s war in Ukraine, unprecedented attack on Israel, and proliferation of UAVs and other dangerous military hardware to terrorist proxies,” said Treasury's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence,Brian Nelson. 


Washington also targeted two companies and a vessel involved in the shipment of Iranian commodities, the Treasury said.


“The United States, in close coordination with our British and Canadian partners, will continue to use all means available to combat those who would finance Iran’s destabilizing activities," Nelson said.


Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 


Sahara Thunder plays key role 


The Treasury said it targeted a company named Sahara Thunder, accusing it of being a main front company that oversees MODAFL's commercial activities in support of the IRGC and Russia's war in Ukraine. 


It said the company plays a key role in Iran's design, development, manufacture and sale of thousands of drones, many of them ultimately transferred to Russia for use against Ukraine. 


As of 2022, Russian officials were negotiating a deal for Sahara Thunder to deliver and produce thousands of drones per year at a facility in Russia under U.S. sanctions, the Treasury said. 


Sahara Thunder's leadership and shipping network, which the Treasury said the company relied on for the sale and shipment of Iranian commodities on behalf of MODAFL to jurisdictions including China, Russia and Venezuela, were also targeted. 


An Iran-based company involved in the procurement and development of unmanned aerial vehicles, its leadership and an Iranian cargo airline were also among those hit with sanctions.


The U.S. earlier this month had warned it would impose further sanctions on Iran following its unprecedented attack on Israel. 


Washington has since taken measures, including targeting Iran's drone program, steel industry and cyber actors. 


Iran this month launched more than 300 drones and missiles against Israel, its first direct attack on the country, in retaliation for a suspected Israeli airstrike on its embassy compound in Damascus on April 11 that killed elite military officers.

## Nothing off the table in US response to China overcapacity, Yellen says

date: 2024-04-25, from: VOA News USA

washington  — The Biden administration is not taking any options off the table to respond to China's excess industrial capacity, which is a top concern for the U.S. and its allies, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Reuters on Thursday.


China exporting its way to full employment is not acceptable to the rest of the world, Yellen said in a Reuters Next interview in Washington.


Yellen said that during her trip to China earlier this month, she was "successful" in raising U.S. concerns with Chinese officials about Beijing flooding global markets with electric vehicles (EVs), solar panels and other clean energy goods, threatening U.S. jobs. She added that Chinese officials acknowledge a problem with industrial overcapacity, but they need to address it.


She said the issue, which threatens producers of similar goods in the U.S., Europe, Japan and emerging markets such as India and Mexico, was again "discussed intensively" with Chinese officials in Washington on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings last week.


Yellen added that the problem will not be resolved "in a day or a week."


"So it's important that China recognize the concern and begin to act to address it," Yellen said. "But we don't want our industry wiped out in the meantime, so I wouldn't want to take anything off the table."


The Biden administration is completing a review of the "Section 301" unfair trade tariffs on Chinese imports imposed by former President Donald Trump in 2018, which U.S. officials have said could lead to higher tariffs on some products. President Joe Biden last week called for the review to triple the Section 301 duties on Chinese steel to 25%.


U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai also told U.S. senators that the U.S. needed to take "early action, decisive action" to protect the fledgling American EV sector from Chinese imports. U.S. tariffs on Chinese vehicle imports are now about 27.5%, and few Chinese EVs are sold in the U.S. at the moment.


"We have no problem with China producing and selling globally and exporting, but the United States and Europe and other countries also want to have some involvement in the ability to produce clean energy products that are going to be of great importance," Yellen said.

## Biden, 17 world leaders demand Hamas release hostages

date: 2024-04-25, from: VOA News USA

Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden and leaders of 17 other countries with citizens believed or known to be held by Hamas are demanding the militant group accept a proposed cease-fire deal with Israel and release the hostages immediately. 


The deal offered would “bring an immediate and prolonged ceasefire in Gaza, that would facilitate a surge of additional necessary humanitarian assistance to be delivered throughout Gaza, and lead to the credible end of hostilities,” they said Thursday in a statement released by the White House. 


“Gazans would be able to return to their homes and their lands with preparations beforehand to ensure shelter and humanitarian provisions,” the statement said. 


In addition to the United States, the 17 countries are Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Spain, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. 


Hamas has rejected a proposed deal that would bring a cease-fire immediately to Gaza in return for the release of women, wounded, elderly and sick hostages, a senior Biden administration official told reporters in a briefing Thursday. However, he said there are signals from the group that suggest they are still considering the offer. 


Various reports suggest Hamas is demanding a complete cease-fire, the full retreat of Israel Defense Forces troops from Gaza, an increase in humanitarian aid, and the full return of displaced Gazans to the north. The group maintains that Israel is not allowing Gazans to go home in an unrestricted way as the IDF has not pulled back from central Gaza. 


The official said the deal being offered to Hamas allows the “unrestricted return” of Gazans to the northern part of the Palestinian enclave and includes provisions for a United Nations mission to ensure shelter and other assistance “over the first weeks of the cease-fire” for the population returning north. 


The statement follows the release by Hamas of a video showing Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin on Wednesday. The video appears to be the first proof that the 24-year-old survived a severe injury during his capture on October 7 from the Nova music festival, during the Hamas attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people.


The U.S.-designated terrorist group took about 250 others hostage, some of whom were released during a brief truce in November. Israel’s military response in Gaza has killed more than 34,000 people, mostly civilians, and has increased tensions in the Middle East.


Video filmed on October 7 of Goldberg-Polin being taken hostage showed his left hand blown off, likely by a grenade. The video that Hamas released on Wednesday is undated and shows him with part of his left arm missing. 


Biden and the leaders said Thursday they strongly support the ongoing mediation efforts. “Let us end this crisis so that collectively we can focus our efforts on bringing peace and stability to the region,” they said. 


The senior administration official places the blame for the failure of negotiations on Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. The official said Sinwar is “ultimately the decision maker” on whether Hamas accepts the deal. 


The official declined to confirm reports that Sinwar recently emerged briefly from the Hamas-dug tunnels to meet with his militants above ground. 


“Justice will come for Sinwar,” he said.

## Too little, and too much, self-promotion

date: 2024-04-25, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>Self-promotion is a weird subject. It’s one of those things that is strictly tied to who you are as a person. I am, broadly speaking, a shy and reserved person. I don’t like to be in the spotlight, I don’t like to draw attention to myself. I also really care about other people's space and time, which is why I’ve always been incredibly conservative when it comes to promoting things I do online.</p>
<p>Every time I need to do something that is marketing-related, I can feel the tension in my brain as if a part of me is trying to fight against it. And this is for the most benign things. I’ll give you an example. I recently edited all P&amp;B interviews and added a line at the end of the intro that reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you're enjoying the People and Blogs series and you want to see it grow, consider supporting on Ko-Fi.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A line of text and a link. The reason why I did that is because the only place where Ko-Fi was mentioned was way at the of each interview and I thought that most people probably stop reading when they reach the end of the interview. And so I added that single line. But adding that single line was a struggle. Because in my head, it’s obvious that if you do enjoy something and are willing to support it, you’d probably go look for a way to do it. That’s how my brain works. But unfortunately, that’s not how the internet works. Apparently, the correct approach seems to be the opposite one. You have to constantly remind people to like and subscribe, to support, to contribute, and to share.</p>
<p>How much self-promotion is too much? Substack interrupting your reading experience to remind you to subscribe feels too much to me. An overlay interrupting your browsing to ask you to subscribe to a newsletter is also too much. Am I wrong? Am I crazy in thinking it’s too much?</p>
<p>Also, is promoting something I’m doing any different than advertising? I know it’s conceptually not the same thing but for you, on the other side of this, is it any different? So many questions. It’s goddamn hard to do “marketing” with integrity.</p>                <hr>

<p>One of today's highlights is the installation InStability, an interactive exhibit by two close friends ( <span class="h-card" translate="no"><a href="https://mas.to/@karafuto" class="u-url mention" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@<span>karafuto</span></a></span> ) that explores seizmic activity in the Reykjanes peninsula (Reykjavík-ish). Using capacitive textiles and pressure sensitive layers the exhibit lets visitors touch the land and create earthquakes at their fingertips. The many seizmic sensors across the land light up as the waves propagate. A deep soundscape (hard to video) permeates the entire venue (a small concert hall) as the quakes strike. </p><p>I was lucky enough to help a tiny bit in the production of the textiles a few evenings. They did such an amazing job. I'm so proud.</p><p>If you're in <a href="https://tilde.zone/tags/reykjavik" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>reykjavik</span></a> swing by Mengi this weekend to see it in action.</p>

## The only viable Android and iOS competitor intends to leave China and go global

date: 2024-04-25, from: OS News

Huawei plans to expand its native HarmonyOS smartphone platform worldwide, despite coming under US-led sanctions that have deprived it of access to key technologies. The Chinese tech megacorp released its own phone platform in 2019, the same year that US sanctions blocked Huawei from having further access to Google&#8217;s Android software to power its devices. More recently, the company saw its Mate 60 Pro smartphone become the top selling device in China&#8217;s huge consumer market, displacing rivals such as Apple&#8217;s iPhone. It also has a newer device, the Pura 70, that could pose a bigger threat to Apple sales in the country. ↫ Dan Robinson at The Register If there is one company that has the capabilities and will to truly offer a third alternative, it&#8217;s Huawei with HarmonyOS. This company has the full might of the Chinese state behind it, and it clearly has the drive to prove itself after the various sanctions levied against it in recent years that barred it from using Google&#8217;s Android. It&#8217;s obviously already experiencing major success in its home market, but now the company intends to go global, country by country, to positino HarmonyOS alongside iOS and Android. Huawei basically takes a brute-force approach, explaining that they identify the 5000 most popular applications, which they claim cover 99% of users&#8217; time with their smartphones, and port those over first. I&#8217;m not entirely sure how they convince developers to port over their applications, but I&#8217;m guessing money is involved. Fair play, I would say &#8211; it&#8217;s not like anything else is going to break the stranglehold Apple and Google have over the mobile application market. We haven&#8217;t really spent much time talking about HarmonyOS in the west in general, and on OSNews in particular, which is a bit of a shame because it has some interesting characteristics. For instance, it has a multi-kernel design, where it uses the Linux kernel on more powerful devices like smartphones and tablets, and the RTOS LiteOS kernel on lower power IoT devices. DSoftBus is another interesting part of the operating system, which allows multiple devices to kind of join together and share data, applications, and control seamlessly. HarmonyOS supports both Android and true HarmonyOS applications, the latter of which are marked with a little logo in the corner of the application icon, but the unique features of HarmonyOS, like DSoftBus, are only accessible to true HarmonyOS applications. Developing these native applications can be done in DevEco Studio, which is built atop IntelliJ IDEA, using ArkUI. Huawei even went so far as to develop its own browser engine for HarmonyOS, which it recently released as open source, called ArkWeb. While HarmonyOS currently still supports running Android applications, this will soon no longer be the case as the company is working on HarmonyOS NEXT, which will remove Android compatibility to focus entirely on true HarmonyOS applications instead. NEXT also does away entirely with the multikernel approach, ditching both the Linux and LiteOS kernels for a new HarmonyOS microkernel, and uses Huawei&#8217;s own Cangjie programming language for application development. HarmonyOS NEXT is currently being tested on a variety of Huawei devices, with a beta and final release planned for later this year. It&#8217;s just our luck that the only potentially viable competitor to Android and iOS is a party closed-source operating system from China, which will surely bring with it a whole host of security concerns in the west. It&#8217;s really difficult at the moment to ascertain just how much of HarmonyOS &#8211; and specifically, HarmonyOS NEXT &#8211; is available as open source, which is a major bummer. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d ever want to use a (partly) closed source Chinese operating system for anything major in my life, but if it&#8217;s open source we could at least see non-Chinese forks that I&#8217;d find easier to trust. The road of iOS and Android competitors is littered with the bodies of failed attempts &#8211; Symbian, the various iterations of Windows Phone, BlackBerry, Sailfish, Ubuntu Touch, the GNOME/Plasma attempts that just can&#8217;t grow beyond proof of concepts &#8211; and there is no way to know if Huawei can pull off outside of China what it did with HarmonyOS inside China. Western markets are incredibly weary of anything related to Huawei, and for all we know, this operating system won&#8217;t ever even be allowed inside the US and the EU in the first place. Regardless of international politics and the CCP&#8217;s brutal, totalitarian, genocidal regime, HarmonyOS NEXT seems like a very interesting platform with fresh ideas, and I&#8217;d love to at least try it out once it hits international markets with proper localisation into English. I&#8217;ll take a problematic Chinese smartphone operating system competitor over no competitor at all &#8211; even if I won&#8217;t use it myself, it&#8217;ll be at least some form of competition both Apple and Google desperately need.

## Palm OS and the devices that ran it

date: 2024-04-25, from: OS News

But just as smartphones would do, PDAs offered a dizzying array of operating systems and applications, and a great many of them ran Palm OS.

## US growth slowed sharply last quarter to 1.6%, reflecting economy pressured by high rates

date: 2024-04-25, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The nation's economy slowed sharply last quarter to a 1.6% annual pace in the face of high interest rates, but consumers — the main driver of economic growth — kept spending at a solid pace.


Thursday's report from the Commerce Department said the gross domestic product — the economy's total output of goods and services — decelerated in the January-March quarter from its brisk 3.4% growth rate in the final three months of 2023.


A surge in imports, which are subtracted from GDP, reduced first-quarter growth by nearly 1 percentage point. Growth was also held back by businesses reducing their inventories. Both those categories tend to fluctuate sharply from quarter to quarter.


By contrast, the core components of the economy still appear sturdy. Along with households, businesses helped drive the economy last quarter with a strong pace of investment.


The import and inventory numbers can be volatile, so "there is still a lot of positive underlying momentum,'' said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.


The economy, though, is still creating price pressures, a continuing source of concern for the Federal Reserve. A measure of inflation in Friday's report accelerated to a 3.4% annual rate from January through March, up from 1.8% in the last three months of 2023 and the biggest increase in a year. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core inflation rose at a 3.7% rate, up from 2% in fourth-quarter 2023.


From January through March, consumer spending rose at a 2.5% annual rate, a solid pace though down from a rate of more than 3% in each of the previous two quarters. Americans' spending on services — everything from movie tickets and restaurant meals to airline fares and doctors' visits — rose 4%, the fastest such pace since mid-2021.


But they cut back spending on goods such as appliances and furniture. Spending on that category fell 0.1%, the first such drop since the summer of 2022.


The state of the U.S. economy has seized Americans' attention as the election season has intensified. Although inflation has slowed sharply from a peak of 9.1% in 2022, prices remain well above their pre-pandemic levels.


Republican critics of President Joe Biden have sought to pin responsibility for high prices on Biden and use it as a cudgel to derail his re-election bid. And polls show that despite the healthy job market, a near-record-high stock market and the sharp pullback in inflation, many Americans blame Biden for high prices.


Last quarter's GDP snapped a streak of six straight quarters of at least 2% annual growth. The 1.6% rate of expansion was also the slowest since the economy actually shrank in the first and second quarters of 2022.


The economy's gradual slowdown reflects, in large part, the much higher borrowing rates for home and auto loans, credit cards and many business loans that have resulted from the 11 interest rate hikes the Fed imposed in its drive to tame inflation.


Even so, the United States has continued to outpace the rest of the world's advanced economies. The International Monetary Fund has projected that the world's largest economy will grow 2.7% for all of 2024, up from 2.5% last year and more than double the growth the IMF expects this year for Germany, France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and Canada.


Businesses have been pouring money into factories, warehouses and other buildings, encouraged by federal incentives to manufacture computer chips and green technology in the United States. On the other hand, their spending on equipment has been weak. And as imports outpace exports, international trade is also thought to have been a drag on the economy's first-quarter growth.


Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF's managing director, cautioned last week that the "flipside″ of strong U.S. economic growth was that it was "taking longer than expected" for inflation to reach the Fed's 2% target, although price pressures have sharply slowed from their mid-2022 peak.


Inflation flared up in the spring of 2021 as the economy rebounded with unexpected speed from the COVID-19 recession, causing severe supply shortages. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 made things significantly worse by inflating prices for the energy and grains the world depends on.


The Fed responded by aggressively raising its benchmark rate between March 2022 and July 2023. Despite widespread predictions of a recession, the economy has proved unexpectedly durable. Hiring so far this year is even stronger than it was in 2023. And unemployment has remained below 4% for 26 straight months, the longest such streak since the 1960s.


Inflation, the main source of Americans' discontent about the economy, has slowed from 9.1% in June 2022 to 3.5%. But progress has stalled lately.


Though the Fed's policymakers signaled last month that they expect to cut rates three times this year, they have lately signaled that they're in no hurry to reduce rates in the face of continued inflationary pressure. Now, a majority of Wall Street traders don't expect them to start until the Fed's September meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool.

## New York appeals court overturns Harvey Weinstein's rape conviction from landmark #MeToo trial

date: 2024-04-25, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — New York's highest court on Thursday overturned Harvey Weinstein's 2020 rape conviction, finding the judge at the landmark #MeToo trial prejudiced the ex-movie mogul with "egregious" improper rulings, including a decision to let women testify about allegations that weren't part of the case.


"We conclude that the trial court erroneously admitted testimony of uncharged, alleged prior sexual acts against persons other than the complainants of the underlying crimes," the court's 4-3 decision said. "The remedy for these egregious errors is a new trial."


The state Court of Appeals ruling reopens a painful chapter in America's reckoning with sexual misconduct by powerful figures — an era that began in 2017 with a flood of allegations against Weinstein. His accusers could again be forced to relive their traumas on the witness stand.


The court's majority said "it is an abuse of judicial discretion to permit untested allegations of nothing more than bad behavior that destroys a defendant's character but sheds no light on their credibility as related to the criminal charges lodged against them."


In a stinging dissent, Judge Madeline Singas wrote that the majority was "whitewashing the facts to conform to a he-said/she-said narrative," and said the Court of Appeals was continuing a "disturbing trend of overturning juries' guilty verdicts in cases involving sexual violence."


"The majority's determination perpetuates outdated notions of sexual violence and allows predators to escape accountability," Singas wrote.


Weinstein, 72, has been serving a 23-year sentence in a New York prison following his conviction on charges of criminal sex act for forcibly performing oral sex on a TV and film production assistant in 2006 and rape in the third degree for an attack on an aspiring actress in 2013.


He will remain imprisoned because he was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape and sentenced to 16 years in prison. Weinstein was acquitted in Los Angeles on charges involving one of the women who testified in New York.


Weinstein's lawyers argued Judge James Burke's rulings in favor of the prosecution turned the trial into "1-800-GET-HARVEY."


The reversal of Weinstein's conviction is the second major #MeToo setback in the last two years, after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of a Pennsylvania court decision to throw out Bill Cosby's sexual assault conviction.


Weinstein's conviction stood for more than four years, heralded by activists and advocates as a milestone achievement, but dissected just as quickly by his lawyers and, later, the Court of Appeals when it heard arguments on the matter in February.


Allegations against Weinstein, the once powerful and feared studio boss behind such Oscar winners as "Pulp Fiction" and "Shakespeare in Love," ushered in the #MeToo movement. Dozens of women came forward to accuse Weinstein, including famous actresses such as Ashley Judd and Uma Thurman. His New York trial drew intense publicity, with protesters chanting "rapist" outside the courthouse.


Weinstein is incarcerated in New York at the Mohawk Correctional Facility, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northwest of Albany.


He maintains his innocence. He contends any sexual activity was consensual.


Weinstein lawyer Arthur Aidala argued before the appeals court in February that Burke swayed the trial by allowing three women to testify about allegations that weren't part of the case and by giving prosecutors permission to confront Weinstein, if he had testified, about his long history of brutish behavior.


Aidala argued the extra testimony went beyond the normally allowable details about motive, opportunity, intent or a common scheme or plan, and essentially put Weinstein on trial for crimes he wasn't charged with.


Weinstein wanted to testify, but opted not to because Burke's ruling would've meant answering questions about more than two-dozen alleged acts of misbehavior dating back four decades, Aidala said. They included fighting with his movie producer brother, flipping over a table in anger and snapping at waiters and yelling at his assistants.


"We had a defendant who was begging to tell his side of the story. It's a he said, she said case, and he's saying 'that's not how it happened. Let me tell you how I did it,'" Aidala argued. Instead, the jurors heard evidence of Weinstein's prior bad behavior that "had nothing to do with truth and veracity. It was all 'he's a bad guy.'"


Aidala also took issue with Burke's refusal to remove a juror who had written a novel involving predatory older men, a topic the defense lawyer argued too closely resembled the issues in Weinstein's case.


A lawyer for the Manhattan district attorney's office, which prosecuted the case, argued that the judge's rulings were proper and that the extra evidence and testimony he allowed was important to provide jurors context about Weinstein's behavior and the way he interacted with women.


"Defendant's argument was that they had a consensual and loving relationship both before and after the charged incidents," Appellate Chief Steven Wu argued, referring to one of the women Weinstein was charged with assaulting. The additional testimony "just rebutted that characterization completely."


Wu said Weinstein's acquittal on the most serious charges — two counts of predatory sexual assault and a first-degree rape charge involving actor Annabella Sciorra's allegations of a mid-1990s rape — showed jurors were paying attention and they were not confused or overwhelmed by the additional testimony.


The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named; Sciorra has spoken publicly about her allegations.


The Court of Appeals agreed last year to take Weinstein's case after an intermediate appeals court upheld his conviction. Prior to their ruling, judges on the lower appellate court had raised doubts about Burke's conduct during oral arguments. One observed that Burke had let prosecutors pile on with "incredibly prejudicial testimony" from additional witnesses.


Burke's term expired at the end of 2022. He was not reappointed and is no longer a judge.


In appealing, Weinstein's lawyers sought a new trial, but only for the criminal sexual act charge. They argued the rape charge could not be retried because it involves alleged conduct outside the statute of limitations.

## Biden’s Big Energy Moves

date: 2024-04-25, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDM0MDAwMC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODQzODE2Nn0.7qLtGHwtvJDuHPOt-W4Ue-pqu3d_1ggV3S7sxzg1utg/image.png?width=1192&height=796&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p><em><strong>Current conditions: </strong>Heavy rains this spring have reinvigorated the drought-stricken wetlands at Spain’s Doñana National Park • Severe thunderstorms are taking shape above the central and southern U.S. • Flooding in Kenya kills at least 32 people and displaces over 40,000.</em></p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2> <h3>1. EPA releases final power plant rules</h3><p>The Environmental Protection Agency finalized its power plant emissions limits on Thursday, imposing the first federal standards on carbon pollution from the electricity sector since the Obama administration’s unsuccessful 2015 Clean Power Plan. “The rules require that newly built natural gas plants that are designed to help meet the grid’s daily, minimum needs, will have to slash their carbon emissions by 90% by 2032, an amount that can only be achieved with the use of carbon capture equipment,” <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/epa-power-plant-rules-gas" rel="noopener" target="_self">Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo reports</a>. The EPA will also severely limit carbon emissions from coal plants based on when they’re supposed to retire — a potential “death blow” to the already embattled industry, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/25/climate/biden-power-plants-pollution.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The New York Times</em><u> reports </u></a>— and from other new gas plants based on how much of the time they’re expected to run. Though the final rule exempts existing gas plants from the carbon capture requirements (at least for now), it could force utilities to rethink plans to rely heavily on new gas plants over the coming years as they move away from coal. The EPA expects the regulations to keep almost 1.4 billion metric tons of carbon from entering the atmosphere through 2047 — assuming they survive the inevitable legal challenges.</p><h3>2. Biden administration boosts transmission</h3><p>The Department of Energy also unveiled on Thursday a few initiatives to expand the electric grid. “While the most important transmission policy changes will likely come from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next month, and possibly permitting reform legislation under consideration in Congress, the White House and Department of Energy are doing what they can with tens of billions of dollars allotted in both the IRA and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and their power over environmental regulations,” <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/biden-power-grid-transmission" target="_self"> Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin writes</a>. The DOE announced up to $331 million in funding for the $1 billion Southwest Intertie Project-North transmission project. The agency also said it was establishing a Coordinated Interagency Transmission Authorization and Permits program to streamline the regulatory process for federal projects. And it introduced a plan to expedite environmental reviews for upgrades to existing transmission lines.</p><h3>3. American Lung Association releases grim air quality report</h3><p>More than one-third of people in the United States now live in places with unhealthy levels of air pollution, according to the American Lung Association’s <a href="https://www.lung.org/research/sota" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2024 State of the Air report</a>. The number of people exposed to harmful amounts of ozone and particulate matter has risen to 131.2 million, an increase of 11.7 million from 2023. And more people are experiencing days with “very unhealthy” or “hazardous” air quality than the country has seen in decades. The report cited the worsening heat, drought, and wildfires caused by climate change, along with heightened federal air quality standards for fine particle pollution, to explain this year’s higher numbers. “Climate change is causing more dangerous air pollution. … We must do more to ensure everyone has clean air,” said Harold Wimmer, President and CEO of the American Lung Association, in a statement.</p><p>California once again dominated the list of counties with the worst air quality, with San Bernardino County ranking highest for ozone, and Kern and Mono counties coming in first for short-term and year-round ozone pollution, respectively.</p><h3>4. The electric grid is overburdened by climate change</h3><p>Climate change is driving an uptick in weather-related power outages, a <a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/weather-related-power-outages-rising" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new report</a> from Climate Central finds. Weather was responsible for 80% of major U.S. power outages between 2000 and 2023. Thanks to climate change straining the country’s aging electric grid, the U.S. saw roughly twice as many weather-related outages over the last decade compared with 2000–2009. Severe weather, winter storms, and tropical storms were the most common culprits, followed by extreme heat and wildfires. “We’re seeing that the warming is having a direct impact on severe weather,” Jen Brady, a report author and senior data analyst at Climate Central, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/24/climate-related-power-outages-surging-in-the-us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em><u>The Guardian</u></em></a>. “The conditions that our infrastructure was built to handle are much different [now] than what they were.”</p><h3>5. New York doubles down on offshore wind</h3><p>New York is looking to bounce back from a dismal week for offshore wind with an accelerated timeline to <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/new-york-speeds-up-offshore-wind-bidding-after-major-setbacks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">secure contracts for new projects</a>. Following the <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/new-york-offshore-wind-canceled" target="_self">recent demise</a> of all three of the conditional offshore wind contracts the state awarded to offshore wind developers last October, the office of Gov.

Hochul’s office also advanced plans to distribute $200 million among offshore wind infrastructure and manufacturing facilities under a $500 million state program aimed at developing the state’s offshore wind supply chain. “New York is solidifying its leadership role in the offshore wind industry,” Hochul said in a statement.</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p>Chinese automaker BYD is expected to debut <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/byd-share-pickup-truck-beijing-auto-show/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its first electrified pickup truck</a>, “Shark,” today at the Beijing Auto Show:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

While the war between Israel and Iran has been mostly covert for years, it has come out of the shadows since Hamas's October 7th attacks. If the United States and Europe want to prevent a regional war from breaking out in the Middle East they will need to convince Iran to rein in its proxies and to do something about its nuclear program. Otherwise, the conflict will continue to spiral.

## Biden administration aims to clean up power sector with revamped rules

date: 2024-04-25, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration on Thursday announced it has finalized rules targeting carbon, air and water pollution from power plants that

it says could cut over 1 billion metric tons from carbon emissions by 2047 even as demand for electricity grows.


The Environmental Protection Agency tightened a proposal to slash carbon emissions from existing coal and new gas plants, and updated and finalized long-standing rules to reduce mercury and toxic air pollutants and clean up wastewater and coal ash discharge.


"EPA is cutting pollution while ensuring that power companies can make smart investments and continue to deliver reliable electricity for all Americans," EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement.


Regan had said in 2022 he intended to take on several regulations together to reduce carbon emissions from power plants, and help states, utilities and plant operators make better investment and plant retirement decisions.


The new rules come as electric utilities brace for a spike in demand from data centers powering technology like generative AI, as well as from the growth of electric vehicles.


The United States is projected this year to add more electric generation capacity than it has done in two decades, with 96% being clean energy, White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi told reporters.


Among the changes the EPA made to the carbon rule is dropping hydrogen as a "best system of emission reduction" for gas plants to achieve new standards.


Now it is just carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) that could be used for the longest-running existing coal units and new gas turbines that run more than 40% of the time. The EPA initially proposed that the standards apply to plants that run more than 50% of the time.


The agency also said coal plants that plan to run past 2039 will be required to install CCS technology starting in 2032 in the final rule. It had initially proposed requiring CCS for plants that will be running past 2040.


The Edison Electric Institute, an investor-owned utility trade group, said it appreciated EPA's approach of bundling the different pollution rules to ease compliance, but was disappointed the agency didn't heed its concerns around CCS viability.


"CCS is not yet ready for full-scale, economy-wide deployment, nor is there sufficient time to permit, finance, and build the CCS infrastructure needed for compliance by 2032," EEI President Dan Brouillette said.


Regan told reporters the agency was confident in the technology, which has been bolstered by Inflation Reduction Act tax incentives, and support from "multiple power companies."


The agency also said it has launched a process to get feedback on how to reduce carbon emissions from existing gas plants. The EPA removed coverage of existing gas plants from the initial proposal last month and gave no new timeline for developing a rule to cover the current fleet.


The EPA also reduced mercury emissions limits for lignite coal plants by 70% and emissions limits associated with toxic metals by 67%, the first update of that rule since 2012, while also finalizing measures that would eliminate 660 million pounds of pollution per year being discharged into U.S. waterways and protect communities from coal ash contamination.


Environmental groups praised the rules for helping to drive down power sector emissions alongside the IRA, putting the administration closer to its goal of net-zero emissions in the sector by 2035.


"The age of unbridled climate pollution from power plants is over," said Manish Bapna, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council.


Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito, top Republican on the Senate environment committee, said she plans to introduce a resolution aiming to overturn the rules.


"President Biden has inexplicably doubled down on his plans to shut down the backbone of America's electric grid through unachievable regulatory mandates," she said.

## The White House Also Has Some Transmission News

The White House also announced a bevy of initiatives and projects meant to bolster infrastructure throughout the country.</p><p>Transmission arguably sits at the absolute center of the Biden administration’s climate policy. Without investments to move new renewable power from where it’s sunny or windy but desolate and remote to where it’s still and cloudy but densely populated, the Inflation Reduction Act is <a href="https://repeatproject.org/docs/REPEAT_IRA_Transmission_2022-09-22.pdfa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>unlikely to meet its emissions reduction potential</u></a>. While the most important transmission policy changes will likely come from the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/ferc-unveil-us-power-grid-reform-may-13-2024-04-19/" target="_blank"><u>Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next month</u></a>, and possibly <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/permitting-reform-transmission-nepa-geothermal" target="_self"><u>permitting reform legislation under consideration in Congress</u></a>, the White House and Department of Energy are doing what they can with tens of billions of dollars allotted in both the IRA and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and their power over environmental regulations.</p><p><span></span>One such pot of money is the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/gdo/transmission-facilitation-program" target="_blank"><u>Transmission Facilitation Program</u></a>, which directs funds towards interregional transmission projects. The DOE announced Thursday that one such project, the Southwest Intertie Project-North, would get up to $331 million in funding. The almost-300 mile-long transmission line would connect wind projects in Idaho to the California electric grid. The project was conditionally approved by California regulators in December and would run from Midpoint, Idaho to Robinson Summit in Eastern Nevada, where it could connect to already operating lines that run to Las Vegas and then interconnect with California. The total costs <a href="https://www.tdworld.com/overhead-transmission/article/21279432/california-iso-approves-key-stage-of-southwest-intertie-north-project" target="_blank"><u>are estimated to run to just over $1 billion</u></a>.</p><p>“We’re building out transmission lines to get clean power from where it's generated to where it's needed,” Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm told reporters Wednesday. The project “will increase grid resilience, especially during wildfires, and it'll create over 300 high quality and union construction jobs,” Granholm said.</p><p>The other announcements had to do with great bugbear of the energy transition: permitting. Transmission projects can take decades from conception to completion, often featuring years-long reviews, stakeholders negotiations, and lawsuits. Interregional transmission — especially in the Western United States, where much of the country’s best wind and solar resources are (along with energy-hungry populations in California and the Southwest) — often takes place on and across public lands, thus ensuring plans must undergo the federal government’s full gamut of environmental review.<br/></p><p>“Right now, it takes about four years, on average, to permit a new transmission project in the U.S., and in extreme cases it can take over a decade,” Granholm said.</p><p>To help speed that up, the DOE said it was establishing a new Coordinated Interagency Transmission Authorization and Permits program, which will facilitate consultation across all relevant government bodies, “create efficiencies, and establish a standard two-year timeline for federal transmission authorizations and permits.” This would establish the DOE as “the main point of contact” for transmission developers Granholm said. This constitutes “a huge improvement from the status quo,” she added, “because developers routinely have to navigate several independent permitting processes throughout the federal government.”</p><p>Also in the same announcement (yes, it was a big one), the DOE also said it was creating a “categorical exclusion” — essentially an exemption from much of the typically required environmental review — for upgrading existing transmission lines. While there’s no way to avoid building new transmission to connect new projects, <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/clean-energy-grid-reconductoring" target="_self"><u>existing lines could be become far more efficient</u></a>, which would go a long way toward handling the <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/biden-ai-electricity-demand" target="_blank">expected steep rise</a> in electricity demand.</p>

## The New EPA Power Plant Rules Are Out — and Could Change the Calculus for Gas

date: 2024-04-25, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjA5NTIzNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MzI1MDc3NH0.WhS_lS-36mwHuZZQq2-ZJCq3gMuG-_aL-nscNBj9CTA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Utilities all over the country have proposed to build a slew of new natural gas-fired power plants in recent months, citing an anticipated surge in electricity demand from data centers, manufacturing, and electric vehicles. But on Thursday, the Environmental Protection Agency finalized new emissions limits on power plants that throw many of those plans into question. </p><p>The rules require that newly built natural gas plants that are designed to help meet the grid’s daily, minimum needs, will have to slash their carbon emissions by 90% by 2032, an amount that can only be achieved with the use of carbon capture equipment. But carbon capture will be cost-prohibitive in many cases — especially in the Southeast, where <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/more-demand-more-gas-inside-the-southeasts-dirty-power-push" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>much of that expected demand growth is concentrated</u></a>, but which lacks the geology necessary to store captured carbon underground. </p><p>“With this rule, it’s kind of back to square one,” Tyler Norris, an electric power systems researcher, told me. “I think most likely, you're gonna see the regulators really push back and call upon them to redo all their modeling.”</p><p>This is the first federal mandate to curb carbon from the electricity sector since President Obama’s 2015 Clean Power Plan, which never went into effect. Despite growing investment in renewable energy, power generation is responsible for about a quarter of <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the country’s greenhouse gas emissions</u></a>.</p><p>The Biden administration is guaranteed to face legal challenges from Republican attorneys general and electric utilities. The Edison Electric Institute, the largest trade group for electric utilities, <a href="https://www.eei.org/News/news/All/eei-statement-on-epa-package-of-final-rules-for-power-plants" target="_blank">asserted</a> that carbon capture “is not yet ready for full-scale, economy-wide deployment” and expressed worry over the timelines for permitting and financing. Duke Energy, one of the Southeast’s largest utilities, issued a statement after the rule came out saying that it “presents significant challenges to customer reliability and affordability – as well as limits the potential of our ability to be a global leader in chips, artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing,” echoing <a href="https://www.electric.coop/nine-regulations-threatening-reliability" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">concerns</a> from the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. The EPA, however, maintains that recent federal investments in carbon capture — including an $85 tax credit for every ton of CO2 captured and stored — render it both “technically feasible and cost-reasonable.”</p><p>As part of the same announcement on Thursday, the Environmental Protection Agency finalized several additional regulations to rein in air and water pollution from coal-fired power plants, including mercury and toxic metals, wastewater, and coal ash, in addition to carbon emissions. During a call with reporters on Wednesday, EPA administrator Michael Regan argued that by finalizing all of these rules at once, the agency was providing the highest degree of regulatory certainty for the power industry. “This approach is both strategic and innovative,” he said. “We are ensuring that the power sector has the information needed to prepare for the future with confidence, enabling strong investment and planning decisions.”</p><p>Initially the EPA was going to require emissions cuts at existing natural gas plants, too, but the agency announced in February that it was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/epa-power-plants-climate-change-natural-gas-coal-1499236035aa7c34dbec36a7144df25e" target="_blank"><u>delaying that rule</u></a> in order to develop a “stronger, more durable approach.” EPA officials offered no new details on the timeline on Wednesday. </p><p>The two other biggest changes the agency made between the proposed and final rules were to push forward and shorten the timeline for coal plant compliance, and to lower the threshold determining how many natural gas plants have to meet the toughest standard — which means more plants will have to control their emissions.</p><p>The agency projects the new standards will prevent a total of nearly 1.4 billion metric tons of carbon emissions through 2047, which is about equal to the amount the power sector emits in a year. That’s significant, but it’s far less than the <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/epa-auto-emissions-rule#:~:text=The%20rules%20strengthen%20greenhouse%20gas,up%20soot%20%E2%80%94%20and%20nitrogen%20oxides." target="_self"><u>clean car rules the EPA finalized in March</u></a>, which are expected to avoid 7.2 billion metric tons of carbon between 2027 and 2055. The EPA also estimates that the power plant rules will produce $370 billion in climate and health benefits over the next two decades, in terms of avoided deaths, hospital visits, and asthma cases. </p><p>The new emissions limits for coal plants are tied to how much longer a given coal plant is slated to operate. Those that plan to shut down before 2032 are exempt altogether. Those that plan to retire by 2039 have to reduce the amount of CO2 they emit per megawatt hour by replacing some of the coal they burn with natural gas beginning in 2030. Coal plants with no plans to retire before 2039 are subject to the highest standard, requiring a 90% drop in emissions by 2032 — which would require capturing the emissions and storing them underground. </p><p>These standards are certain to lead to more plant closures, but coal plants are already shutting down at a rapid pace purely based on economics and the fact that so many of them are so old. Getting the rules in place is less about tackling coal emissions, per se, and more about “getting utilities thinking more proactive about how they are going to replace these coal plants,” Michelle Solomon, a senior policy advisor at the nonprofit think tank Energy Innovation, told me.</p><p>Gas, however, is another story. Utilities have been sounding the alarm about a coming surge in electricity demand. Electric companies throughout the Southeast, as well as Texas, Wisconsin, and elsewhere, have proposed building dozens of new natural gas plants, arguing that renewables and batteries aren’t up to the task of providing a reliable, dispatchable source of power.</p><p>Whether that coming demand is real or inflated is a <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/ai-energy-consumption" target="_self"><u>matter of debate</u></a>. But regardless, clean energy researchers and advocates dispute the idea that gas plants are needed for reliability. </p><p>“Utilities are seeing an additional need for peak capacity, not an additional need for capacity throughout the day,” Solomon told me, asserting it was possible to meet those peaks with solar and storage, or even by improving efficiency so that the peaks aren’t as high. The trick is making sure we can bring those resources online fast enough. To that end, the Department of Energy also announced a number of initiatives to <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/biden-power-grid-transmission" target="_self"><u>boost transmission infrastructure</u></a> on Thursday. </p><p>The EPA’s regulations for new gas plants are tied to how frequently they are intended to operate. Plants that are designed to switch on during times of peak demand — a variety called a “simple cycle” combustion turbine plant — won’t have to do anything differently. Plants that run a bit more often — so-called “intermediate” resources that might run daily from mid-morning till the evening, at 20% to 40% of their annual capacity — will be required to install the most efficient equipment available on the market. Any that operate more frequently than that will be subject to the 90% emissions reduction standard by 2032. This primarily affects “combined cycle” plants, which are more efficient than simple cycle but can’t ramp up and down as quickly or easily.</p><p>Utilities with recently hatched plans to build simple cycle plants, <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/georgia-power-approval-plant-yates-irp/713404/" target="_blank"><u>including Georgia Power</u></a>, are unlikely to be affected by the rule at all. “I do think that makes sense, given the focus of these rules, which are on carbon emissions,” Amanda Levin, a director of policy analysis at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told me. “Given the frequency and type of operation for [simple cycle], they’re not as significant as sources of CO2.” </p><p>But those utilities that are planning to build combined cycle projects — and many of them are — could be forced to go back to the drawing board. Norris noted that Duke Energy, which serves customers in North and South Carolina and has proposed building more than 6 gigawatts of combined cycle capacity, will be especially exposed.</p><p>For combined cycle plants, there are essentially two options to comply: Install carbon capture, or plan to run your plant a lot less frequently. In either case, it “dramatically increases the levelized cost of those units,” Norris told me. “So I think any reasonable regulator would say we've got to go back and do a much more rigorous comparative analysis to other least-cost solutions.”</p><p>Solomon has a more cynical view of the recent panic over electricity demand and rush to build new gas plants. “We’ve known that demand is growing, is going to grow, for a long time,” she told me. “The fact that there’s quite a lot of news about this just as the rules are coming out is unlikely to be a total coincidence.”</p><p><em>Editor’s note: This story has been updated to reflect statements from Duke Energy and trade groups.</em><br/></p>

## Blinken kicks off direct engagement with China ahead of tough talks

date: 2024-04-25, from: VOA News USA

State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken underscored the necessity for "direct" and "sustained engagement" between the United States and China during his first official meeting in Shanghai, a city home to more than 1,000 U.S. companies.


Thursday morning, Blinken held talks with Chen Jining, Chinese Communist Party Secretary for Shanghai. Chen is the highest-ranking local official and is a member of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party.


Blinken said he would lay out "our differences, which are real" but seek to "work through them" as well as to "build cooperation where we can."


Welcoming the Secretary to Shanghai at the city’s Grand Halls, Chen said through a translator that since the establishment of diplomatic ties, the relationship between the two nations has not always been smooth, there's always been "twists and turns," "but overall, it has progressed with historical development and progressed forward."


Blinken was last in Shanghai in 2015 when he was deputy secretary of state.


"In a constructive and candid exchange, the secretary raised concerns about PRC trade policies and non-market economic practices and stressed that the United States seeks a healthy economic competition with the PRC and a level playing field for U.S. workers and firms operating in China," said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.  He was referring to People’s Republic of China.


During a discussion with American and Chinese students from New York University Shanghai, Blinken underscored the importance of expanding exchanges between students, scholars, and business.


"We need to make sure that we are talking to each other, hearing each other, understanding each other," he said.


According to the State Department, the NYU Shanghai student body currently consists of nearly 2,000 undergraduate and graduate students, half of whom are from China. Students from the United States and some 70 other countries represent the other half.  There are approximately 500 U.S. students.


Later Thursday, Blinken met with business leaders at the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, advocating for the resolution of a range of trade issues facing the world’s two largest economies.


In a brief video, Blinken said late Wednesday he is in China “to make progress on issues that matter most to the American people, including curbing fentanyl trafficking,” against the backdrop of Shanghai's skyline. He added that officials from the U.S. and China will also discuss other areas where the two countries have "significant disagreements."




While Washington and Beijing are divided over a range of thorny issues, Blinken began his visit to China this week focusing first on the importance of direct engagement. It is something, he says, is essential for addressing key issues affecting people from both countries and the world. 


Analysts told VOA Blinken's visit will surface a range of contentious issues but also maintain "the tactical thaw" that gained momentum following U.S. President Joe Biden's face-to-face talks with PRC President Xi Jinping last November.


"The relationship continues to grow more competitive militarily, technologically, and diplomatically, but the increase is occurring in a more predictable, controlled manner than it was a year earlier due to both countries' continued investment in high-level diplomacy," Ali Wyne, a senior research and advocacy adviser for International Crisis Group, told VOA Mandarin in an email.


Intensive diplomacy between Washington and Beijing has yielded little progress in curtailing China's supply of precursor chemicals used to manufacture illicit fentanyl that affects the United States.  Strains are escalating due to China's support for Russia in its war on Ukraine, prompting the U.S. to warn further actions against China.


"I'm very pessimistic about this visit. Xi Jinping is committed to helping his close friend Putin and will not be very responsive to America's requests," Dennis Wilder, senior fellow for the Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues at Georgetown University, told VOA Mandarin.


A day before Blinken departed for Shanghai, he unveiled the State Department's annual report on human rights practices, which said that the PRC government continues to commit genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.  Blinken told reporters that he would raise the issue of human rights with the Beijing government.


Blinken is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing Friday afternoon.


The State Department said Blinken will hold a press conference in Beijing before returning to Washington.

This morning, President Joe Biden signed into law the $95 billion national security supplemental bill providing military aid to Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific, as well as humanitarian aid to Gaza and other peoples suffering humanitarian crises. The Pentagon immediately sent about a billion dollars worth of ammunition, air defense munitions, and artillery rounds, as well as weapons and armored vehicles to Ukraine. The U.S. Department of Defense had moved supplies into Poland and Germany in hopes that the measure would pass; they should move into Ukraine soon.

## US police clash with students who demand colleges cut financial ties to Israel

date: 2024-04-25, from: VOA News USA

austin, texas — Police tangled with student demonstrators in the U.S. states of Texas and California while new encampments sprouted Wednesday at Harvard and other colleges as school leaders sought ways to defuse a growing wave of pro-Palestinian protests.


At the University of Texas at Austin, hundreds of local and state police — including some on horseback and holding batons — clashed with protesters, pushing them off the campus lawn and at one point sending some tumbling into the street. At least 20 demonstrators were taken into custody at the request of university officials and Texas Governor Greg Abbott, according to the state Department of Public Safety.


A photographer covering the demonstration for Fox 7 Austin was arrested after being caught in a push-and-pull between law enforcement and students, the station confirmed. A longtime Texas journalist was knocked down in the mayhem and could be seen bleeding before police helped him to emergency medical staff who bandaged his head.


At the University of Southern California, police got into a back-and-forth tugging match with protesters over tents, removing several before falling back. At the northern end of California, students were barricaded inside a building for a third day at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt. The school shut down campus through the weekend and made classes virtual.


Harvard University in Massachusetts had sought to stay ahead of protests this week by limiting access to Harvard Yard and requiring permission for tents and tables. That didn't stop protesters from setting up a camp with 14 tents Wednesday following a rally against the university's suspension of the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee.


Students protesting the Israel-Hamas war are demanding schools cut financial ties to Israel and divest from companies enabling its monthslong conflict. Dozens have been arrested on charges of trespassing or disorderly conduct. Some Jewish students say the protests have veered into antisemitism and made them afraid to set foot on campus.




Columbia University averted another confrontation between students and police earlier in the day. The situation there remained tense, with campus officials saying it would continue talks with protesters for another 48 hours.


On a visit to campus, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, called on Columbia University President Minouche Shafik to resign "if she cannot bring order to this chaos."


"If this is not contained quickly and if these threats and intimidation are not stopped, there is an appropriate time for the National Guard," he said.


Shafik had set a midnight Tuesday deadline to reach an agreement on clearing an encampment, but the school extended negotiations, saying it was making "important progress."


On Wednesday evening, a Columbia spokesperson said rumors that the university had threatened to bring in the National Guard were unfounded. "Our focus is to restore order, and if we can get there through dialogue, we will," said Ben Chang, Columbia's vice president for communications.


Columbia graduate student Omer Lubaton Granot, who put up pictures of Israeli hostages near the encampment, said he wanted to remind people that there were more than 100 hostages still being held by Hamas.




"I see all the people behind me advocating for human rights," he said. "I don't think they have one word to say about the fact that people their age, that were kidnapped from their homes or from a music festival in Israel, are held by a terror organization."


Harvard law student Tala Alfoqaha, who is Palestinian, said she and other protesters want more transparency from the university.


"My hope is that the Harvard administration listens to what its students have been asking for all year, which is divestment, disclosure and dropping any sort of charges against students," she said.




Columbia encampment inspires others


Police first tried to clear the encampment at Columbia last week, when they arrested more than 100 protesters. The move backfired, acting as an inspiration for other students across the country to set up similar encampments and motivating protesters at Columbia to regroup.


On Wednesday about 60 tents remained at the Columbia encampment, which appeared calm. Security remained tight around campus, with identification required and police setting up metal barricades.


Columbia said it had agreed with protest representatives that only students would remain at the encampment and they would make it welcoming, banning discriminatory or harassing language.


On the University of Minnesota campus, a few dozen students rallied a day after nine protesters were arrested when police took down an encampment in front of the library. U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, whose daughter was among the demonstrators arrested at Columbia last week, attended a protest later in the day.


A group of more than 80 professors and assistant professors signed a letter Wednesday calling on the university's president and other administrators to drop any charges and to allow future encampments without what they described as police retaliation.


They wrote that they were "horrified that the administration would permit such a clear violation of our students' rights to freely speak out against genocide and ongoing occupation of Palestine."


Netanyahu encourages police response


Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out at the pro-Palestinian demonstrations on U.S. college campuses in a video statement released Wednesday, saying the response of several university presidents has been "shameful" and calling on state, local and federal officials to intervene.


Students at some protests were hiding their identities and declined to identify themselves to reporters, saying they feared retribution. At an encampment of about 40 tents at the heart of the University of Michigan's campus in Ann Arbor, almost every student wore a mask, which was handed to them when they entered.


The upwelling of demonstrations has left universities struggling to balance campus safety with free speech rights. Many long tolerated the protests, but are now doling out more heavy-handed discipline, citing safety concerns.


At New York University this week, police said 133 protesters were taken into custody and all had been released with summonses to appear in court on disorderly conduct charges. More than 40 protesters were arrested Monday at an encampment at Yale University.

## Columbia University demonstrators in talks with administration officials

date: 2024-04-25, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Officials at Columbia University were continuing talks Wednesday with student demonstrators from the Gaza Solidarity Encampment as the protest reaches a full week.


At 9:41 p.m. Tuesday, university President Nemat “Minouche” Shafik sent an email to the Columbia community setting a midnight deadline for an agreement to be reached about dismantling the encampment and dispersing the protesters.


“I very much hope these discussions are successful,” she wrote. “If they are not, we will have to consider alternative options for clearing the West Lawn and restoring calm to campus so that students can complete the term and graduate.”




As midnight passed, Columbia University Apartheid Divest posted a statement on X saying, “We refuse to concede to cowardly threats and blatant intimidation by university administration. We will continue to peacefully protest.”


The statement also said the university had threatened to call the National Guard. But after visiting the university earlier in the week, New York Governor Kathy Hochul said Tuesday she had no plans to deploy the National Guard.


As midnight approached on Tuesday, a student organizer announced that the deadline had been extended to 8 a.m. Wednesday.


At 4:09 a.m., the Office of the President sent an email saying the discussion deadline would be extended for 48 hours, given the constructive dialogue, and the university would report back on progress.


The email announced that leaders of the student encampment had agreed to remove a significant number of tents, get non-Columbia affiliates to leave the encampment and comply with New York Fire Department requirements. They also agreed to ensure that the encampment is “welcome to all” and to prohibit “discriminatory or harassing language.”


This development comes nearly a week after more than 100 students were arrested at the school on April 18, after Shafik authorized police to clear away protesters. Some of the students received suspension notices from the school.


Columbia’s action prompted an onslaught of pro-Palestinian demonstrations at other universities and responses from faculty and politicians.


Students at other campuses, such as Yale, Stanford and New York University, have also rallied around the Palestinian cause, calling for their universities to divest from companies with ties to Israel and for a cease-fire in Gaza. Many also have put up tent encampments on their campuses. About 150 students and faculty were arrested at New York University Monday night.


Columbia also announced Tuesday morning that classes on the Morningside main campus, where the protests are taking place, will be offered in a hybrid format for the remainder of the spring semester. The last day of classes is April 29.

## Arizona House sends repeal of state's near-total abortion ban to Senate

date: 2024-04-25, from: VOA News USA

PHOENIX — A proposed repeal of Arizona's near-total ban on abortions won approval Wednesday from the state House after two weeks of mounting pressure on Republicans over an issue that has bedeviled former President Donald Trump's campaign to return to the White House. 


Three Republicans joined in with all 29 Democrats to vote to repeal a law that predated Arizona's statehood and provides no exceptions for rape or incest. If the Senate approves as expected, Arizona would allow abortions up to 15 weeks. 


Their political ambitions imperiled by widespread opposition to a near-total abortion ban, Trump and U.S. Senate candidate Kari Lake had urged Arizona lawmakers to ease the restrictions. But until Wednesday, most state House Republicans repeatedly used procedural votes to block repeal, each time drawing condemnation from Democratic President Joe Biden, who has made his support for abortion rights central to his reelection campaign. 


"Make no mistake, Arizonans are living in 1864 now because Donald Trump dismantled Roe v. Wade," Democratic state Senator Priya Sundareshan of Tucson said in a news conference before the vote. It was organized by the Biden campaign and the Arizona Democratic Party. 


Arizona is one of a handful of battleground states that will decide the next president. Trump, who has warned that the issue could lead to Republican losses, has avoided endorsing a national abortion ban but said he's proud to have appointed the Supreme Court justices who allowed states to outlaw the procedure. 


Arizona Republicans have been under intense pressure from some conservatives in their base, who firmly support the abortion ban, even as it's become a liability with swing voters who will decide crucial races including the presidency, the U.S. Senate and the GOP's control of the Legislature. 


"I am disgusted today," said Republican Representative Rachel Jones, who voted against repeal. "Life is one of the tenets of our Republican platform. To see people go back on that value is egregious to me." 




State Representative Matt Gress, one of the three Republicans who crossed party lines to support the repeal measure, said in a statement that the near-total abortion ban was "unworkable and out of line with the values of Arizonans." GOP Representative Tim Dunn said his vote in favor of repeal was "the most pro-life vote I could possibly make" because, he said, backlash to the total ban would lead voters to support abortion even after 15 weeks. 


The other Republican who supported the repeal measure, state Representative Justin Wilmeth, didn't return an email and phone call seeking comment on the vote. 


The Arizona Supreme Court concluded this month that the state could enforce the long-dormant law that permits abortions only to save the pregnant patient's life. The ruling suggested doctors could be prosecuted under the law first approved in 1864, which carries a sentence of two to five years in prison for anyone who assists in an abortion. 


The law had been blocked since the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision guaranteed the constitutional right to an abortion nationwide. 


After Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022, then-Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, convinced a state judge that the 1864 ban could be enforced. The law hasn't been enforced while the case was making its way through the courts. Brnovich's Democratic successor, Attorney General Kris Mayes, urged the state's high court against reviving the law. 


Mayes has said the earliest the law could be enforced is June 8. But the anti-abortion-rights group defending the ban, Alliance Defending Freedom, maintains county prosecutors can begin enforcing it once the Supreme Court's decision becomes final, which is expected to occur this week. 


If the proposed repeal wins final approval from the Republican-controlled Legislature and is signed into law by Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs, a 2022 statute banning the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy would become the prevailing abortion law. Even so, there would likely be a period where all abortions are outlawed, because the repeal won't take effect until 90 days after the end of the legislative session, likely in midsummer. 


Advocates are collecting signatures for a ballot measure allowing abortions until a fetus could survive outside the womb, typically around 24 weeks, with exceptions — to save the parent's life, or to protect her physical or mental health. 


Republican lawmakers, in turn, are considering putting one or more competing abortion proposals on the November ballot.

## Arizona indicts nearly 20 in case over 2020 election in Arizona, including Giuliani and Meadows

date: 2024-04-25, from: VOA News USA

PHOENIX — An Arizona grand jury has indicted former Donald Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows and lawyer Rudy Giuliani along with 16 others in an election interference case.


The indictment released Wednesday names 11 Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring that Donald Trump beat Joe Biden in Arizona in the 2020 presidential election. It shows seven other defendants whose names were not immediately released because they had not yet been served with the charges.


The Associated Press was able to determine the identities of the unnamed defendants based on their descriptions in the indictment.


One is described as an attorney "who was often identified as the Mayor" and spread false allegations of election fraud, a description that clearly describes Giuliani. Another is described as Trump's " chief of staff in 2020," which describes Meadows.


"I will not allow American democracy to be undermined," Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a video released by her office. "It's too important."


The 11 people who had been nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were "duly elected and qualified" electors and claiming that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.


Biden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes. Of the eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 Republicans who would later sign the certificate declaring Trump as the winner.


Their lawsuit asked a judge to de-certify the results that gave Biden his victory in Arizona and block the state from sending them to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa said the Republicans lacked legal standing, waited too long to bring their case and "failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims."


Days after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 Republicans participated in the certificate signing.


The Arizona charges come after a string of indictments against fake electors in other states.


In December, a Nevada grand jury indicted six Republicans on felony charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument in connection with false election certificates. They have pleaded not guilty.


Michigan's Attorney General in July filed felony charges that included forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery against 16 Republican fake electors. One had charges dropped after reaching a cooperation deal, and the 15 remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty.


Three fake electors also have been charged in Georgia alongside Trump and others in a sweeping indictment accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the results. They have pleaded not guilty.


In Wisconsin, 10 Republicans who posed as electors settled a civil lawsuit, admitting their actions were part of an effort to overturn Biden's victory. There is no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin.


Trump also was indicted in August in federal court over the fake electors scheme. The indictment states that when Trump was unable to persuade state officials to illegally swing the election, he and his Republican allies began recruiting a slate of fake electors in battleground states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — to sign certificates falsely stating he, not Biden, had won their states.


In early January, New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez said that state's five Republican electors cannot be prosecuted under the current law. In New Mexico and Pennsylvania, fake electors added a caveat saying the election certificate was submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. No charges have been filed in Pennsylvania.


In Arizona, Mayes' predecessor, Republican Mark Brnovich, conducted an investigation of the 2020 election, but the fake elector allegations were not part of that examination, according to Mayes' office.


In another election-related case brought by Mayes' office, two Republican officials in a rural Arizona county who delayed canvassing the 2022 general election results face felony charges. A grand jury indicted Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby in November on one count each of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. Both pleaded not guilty.


The Republicans facing charges are Kelli Ward, the state GOP's chair from 2019 until early 2023; state Sen. Jake Hoffman; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA who serves on the Republican National Committee; state Sen. Anthony Kern, who was photographed in restricted areas outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and is now a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; energy industry executive James Lamon, who lost a 2022 Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat; Robert Montgomery, chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee in 2020; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; and Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward.


None of the 11 responded to either phone, email or social media messages from The Associated Press on Wednesday seeking comment.

## Getting Started with Miranda

date: 2024-04-25, from: Robert's Ramblings

I've been interested in exploring the Miranda programming language. It's a language influenced Haskell which has been used for programs I use almost daily such as [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) and [shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/). I've given a quick review of [miranda.org.uk](https://miranda.org.uk) to get a sense of the language but to follow along with the [Miranda: The Craft of Functional Programming](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/sjt/Miranda_craft/) it is really helpful to have Miranda available on my machine. Today that machine is a Mac Mini, M1 processor, running macOS Sonoma (14.4.x) and the related Xcode C tool chain.  I ran into to minor hiccups in compilation and installation. Both easy to overcome but ones I will surely forget in the future. Thus I write myself another blog post.

First down load Miranda source code at <http://miranda.org.uk/downloads>. The version 2.066 is the most recent release I saw linked (2024-04-25), <http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/ccount/click.php?id=11>. The [COPYING](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/downloads/COPYING) link shows the terms under which this source release is made available.

Next you need to untar/gzip the tarball you downloaded. Try running `make` to see if it compiles. On my Mac Mini I got a compile error that looks like

~~~shell
make
gcc -w    -c -o data.o data.c
data.c:666:43: error: incompatible integer to pointer conversion passing 'word' (aka 'long') to parameter of type 'char *' [-Wint-conversion]
                     else fprintf(f,"%c%s",HERE_X,mkrel(hd[x]));
                                                        ^~~~~
1 error generated.
make: *** [data.o] Error 1
~~~

While I'm rusty on C I read this as the C compiler being more strict today then it was back in the 1990s. That's a good thing generally.  Next I checked the compiler version. ...
