<strong>Comment</strong>  Microsoft may emerge as the real winner from

<h2 id="two-turkeys-liberty-and-bell-pardoned-by-biden">Two Turkeys
‘Liberty’ and ‘Bell’ Pardoned by Biden</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>“Liberty” and “Bell” — two turkeys — strutted onto the White House
South Lawn Monday and became immediate celebrities for what has become
the official beginning of the holidays in Washington. </p>
<p>Amid an autumn day, with Christmas carols playing, President Joe
Biden addressed the families of staff, 4-H and Future Farmers of
America, and students from Eliot-Hine Middle School as they gathered for
the popular event. </p>
<p>Next to him stood a table lined with a fall garland of burgundy,
green, orange and yellow, bearing a sign “Happy Thanksgiving 2023.”
 Standing on it was an 18 kg (40lb) turkey, with another next to it on
the ground, beside the Minnesota farmers who raised them.</p>
<p>“I hereby pardon Liberty and Bell,” said Biden, as the male turkey
fanned its tail. And, with that, the two birds were given the long-held
tradition of a long life, just days prior to the American holiday that
features a roasted turkey as its centerpiece.</p>
<p>Turkeys on leashes at the White House</p>
<p>In 1989, then President George H.W. Bush promised a crowd of children
and reporters that the 23 kg (50lb) turkey donated to the White House
would not be eaten.  </p>
<p>President Bush was the first to make the pardon an annual action, but
not the first to show mercy for a bird. The son of President Abraham
Lincoln treated the turkey like a dog, leading him around on a leash
inside the White House. Ultimately, President Lincoln granted the turkey
clemency. </p>
<p>The act of donating a turkey (or a gaggle of gobblers) dates to the
1800s and embraces the nation’s heritage of farmland.  For the past
month, Biden has traveled to rural America, announcing $5 billion in
investments.  </p>
<p>“We’re restoring hope and opportunity so family farms can stay in the
family,” proclaimed Biden at Monday’s event, “and children don’t have to
leave home if they wish to stay and make a living on the farm.” </p>
<p>Biden told the crowd that the birds love the Minnesota favorites,
including Honeycrisp apples, ice hockey, a thousand lakes and the Mall
of America.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Happy 81st birthday </p>
<p>President Biden’s 81st birthday coincided with the holiday event. He
evoked laughter when he told the crowd, “I just want you to know, it’s
difficult turning 60.”  The president’s age has been raised by opponents
and analysts as he seeks a second term.  During his speech Monday, Biden
confused Britney Spears with Taylor Swift when referencing Swift’s Eras
tour in Brazil.  </p>
<p>The president plans to celebrate his birthday with family this
weekend in Nantucket. </p>
<p>The birds will live on as agriculture models at the University of
Minnesota.  Having been named after the Liberty Bell, the symbol of
independence in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the president said his
pardon gave the turkeys “a new appreciation for the words, ‘Let freedom
ring.’”</p>

<h2 id="openai-is-a-cautionary-tale-about-nonprofits">OpenAI Is a
Cautionary Tale About Nonprofits</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-21, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDUyMzM1OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxOTM2MDU4OH0.94OPR0jhyFXPWQo4w-_uLZBBmosxhV55rpLd6GoGsK0/image.jpg?width=1195&height=795&coordinates=3%2C5%2C2%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps" style>
Surely you’ve heard by now. On Friday, the board of directors of OpenAI,
the world-bestriding startup at the center of the new artificial
intelligence boom, fired its chief executive, Sam Altman. He had not
been “consistently candid” with the board, the company said, setting in
motion a coup — and potential counter-coup — that has transfixed the
tech, business, and media industries for the past 72 hours.
</p>
<p style>
OpenAI is — was? — a strange organization. Until last week, it was both
the country’s hottest new tech company and an independent nonprofit
<a href="https://openai.com/charter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">devoted
to ensuring</a> that a hypothetical, hyper-intelligent AI “benefits all
of humanity.” The nonprofit board owned and controlled the for-profit
startup, but it did not fund it entirely; the startup could and did
accept outside investment, such as
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/08/microsofts-complex-bet-on-openai-brings-potential-and-uncertainty.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
$13 billion infusion</a> from Microsoft.
</p>
<p style>
This kind of dual nonprofit/for-profit structure isn’t uncommon in the
tech industry. The encrypted messaging app
<a href="https://signal.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Signal</a>,
for instance, is owned by
<a href="https://signalfoundation.org/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
foundation</a>, as is the company that makes
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
cheap, programmable microchip Raspberry Pi</a>. The open-source browser
Firefox
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-05-05/why-google-keeps-paying-mozilla-s-firefox-even-as-chrome-dominates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is
overseen</a> by the Mozilla Foundation.
</p>
<p style>
But OpenAI’s structure is unusually convoluted, with two nested holding
companies and
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-20/who-controls-openai#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank">a
growing split</a> between who was providing the money (Microsoft) and
who ostensibly controlled operations (the nonprofit board). That tension
between the nonprofit board and the for-profit company is what
ultimately ripped apart OpenAI, because when the people with control
(the board) tried to fire Altman, the people with the money (Microsoft)
said no. As I write this, Microsoft seems
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-20/openai-staff-threaten-to-go-to-microsoft-if-board-doesn-t-quit" target="_blank">likely</a>
to win.
</p>
<p>
This may all seem remote from what we cover here at Heatmap. Other than
the fact that ChatGPT devours electricity, OpenAI doesn’t obviously have
anything to do with climate change, electric vehicles, or the energy
transition. Sometimes I even have the sense that many climate advocates
take a certain delight in high-profile AI setbacks, because they resent
competing with it for existential-risk airtime.
</p>
<p>
Yet OpenAI’s schism is a warning for climate world. Strip back the
money, the apocalypticism, the big ideas and <em>Terminator</em>
references, and OpenAI is fundamentally a story about nonprofit
governance. When a majority of the board decided to knock Altman from
his perch, nobody could stop them. They alone decided to torch $80
billion in market value overnight and set their institution on fire.
Whether that was the right or wrong choice, it illustrates how nonprofit
organizations — especially those that, like OpenAI, are controlled
solely by a board of directors — act with an unusual amount of arbitrary
authority.
</p>
<p style>
Why does that matter for the climate or environmental movement? Because
the climate and energy world is absolutely<em> teeming</em> with
nonprofit organizations — and many of them are just as unconstrained,
just as willfully wacky, as OpenAI.

Let’s step back. Nonprofits can generally be governed in two ways.
(Apologies to nonprofit lawyers in the audience: I’m about to vastly
simplify your specialty.) The first is a chapter- or membership-driven
structure, in which a mass membership elects leaders to serve on a board
of directors. Many unions, social clubs, and business groups take this
form: Every few years, the members elect a new president or board of
directors, who lead the organization for the next few years.
</p>
<p>
The other way is a so-called “board-only” organization. In this
structure, the nonprofit’s board of directors leads the organization and
does not answer to a membership or chapter. (There is often no
membership to answer to.) When a vacancy opens up on the board, its
remaining members appoint a replacement, perpetuating itself over time.
</p>
<p>
OpenAI was just such
<a href="https://www.501c3.org/kb/board-of-directors-vs-membership-governance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
board-only organization</a>. Even though Altman was CEO, OpenAI was led
officially by its board of directors.
</p>
<p>
This is a stranger way of running an organization than it may seem. For
a small, private foundation, it may work just fine: Such an organization
has no staff and probably meets rarely. (Most U.S. nonprofits are just
this sort of organization.) But when a board-only nonprofit gets big —
when it fulfills a crucial public purpose or employs hundreds or
thousands of people — it faces an unusual <em>lack</em> of institutional
constraints.
</p>
<p>
Consider, for instance, what life is like for a decently sized business,
a small government agency, and a medium-sized nonprofit. The decently
sized business is constantly buffeted by external forcing factors. Its
creditors need to be repaid; it is battling for market share and product
position. It faces market discipline or at least some kind of profit
motive. It has to remain focused, competitive, and at least
theoretically efficient.
</p>
<p>
The government agency, meanwhile, is constrained by public scrutiny and
political oversight. Its bureaucrats and public servants are managed by
elected officials, who are themselves accountable to the public. When a
particularly important agency is not doing its job, voters can demand a
change or elect new leadership.
</p>
<p>
Nonprofits can have some of the same built-in checks and balances — but
only when they are controlled by <em>members, </em>and not by a board.
If a members association embarrasses itself, for instance, or if it
doesn’t carry out its mission, then its membership can vote out the
board and elect new directors to replace them. But stakeholders have no
such recourse for a board-only nonprofit. Insulated from market pressure
and public oversight, board-only nonprofits are free to wander off into
wackadoodle land.
</p>
<p>
The problem is that board-only nonprofits are only becoming more
powerful — in fact, many of the nonprofits you know best are probably
controlled solely by their board. In 2002, the Harvard political
scientist Theda Skocpol
<a href="https://prospect.org/power/associations-without-members/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">observed</a>
that American civic life had undergone a rapid transformation: where it
had once been full of membership-driven federations, such as the Lions
Club or the League of Women Voters, it was now dominated by
issues-focused advocacy groups.
</p>
<p>
From the late 19th to the mid-20th century, she wrote, America “had a
uniquely balanced civic life, in which markets expanded but could not
subsume civil society, in which governments at multiple levels
deliberately and indirectly encouraged federated voluntary
associations.” But from the 1960s to the 1990s, that old network fell
apart. It was “bypassed and shoved to the side by a gaggle of
professionally dominated advocacy groups and nonprofit institutions
rarely attached to memberships worthy of the name,” Skocpol wrote.
</p>
<p>
The sheer number of groups exploded. In 1958, the Encyclopedia of
Associations listed approximately 6,500 associations, Skocpol writes. By
1990, that number had more than tripled to 23,000. Today, the American
Society of Association Executives — which is, just so we’re clear here,
literally an association for associations —
<a href="https://powerofassociations.org/facts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">counts
almost 1.9 million associations</a>, including 1.2 million nonprofits.
</p>
<p>
This new network includes some nonprofits that claim to have members but
are not in fact governed by them, such as
<a href="https://www.aarp.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
AARP</a>. It includes “public citizen” or legal-advocacy groups, which
watchdog legislation or fight for important precedents in the courts,
such as
<a href="https://earthjustice.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Earthjustice</a>,
<a href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
Center for Biological Diversity</a>, or
<a href="https://www.citizen.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Public
Citizen</a> itself. And it includes independent, mission-driven, and
board-controlled nonprofits — such as OpenAI.
</p>
<p>
There is nothing wrong with these new groups per se. Many of them are
inspired by the advocacy and legal organizations that won some of the
Civil Rights Movement’s biggest victories. But unlike the member
federations and civic associations that they largely replaced, these new
groups don’t force Americans to engage with what their neighbors are
thinking and feeling. So they “compartmentalize” America, in Skocpol’s
words. Instead of articulating the views of a deep, national membership
network, these groups essentially speak for a centralized and
professionalized leadership corps — invariably located in a major city —
who are armed with modern marketing techniques. And instead of
fundraising through dues, fees, or tithes, these new groups depend on
direct-mail operations, massive ad campaigns, and foundation grants.
</p>
<p style>
This is the organizational superstructure on which much of the modern
climate movement rests. When you read a climate news story, someone
quoted in it will probably work for such a nonprofit. Many climate and
energy policy experts spend at least part of their careers at some kind
of nonprofit. Most climate or environmental news outlets — although not
this one — are funded in whole or part through donations and foundation
grants. And most climate initiatives that earn mainstream attention
receive grants from a handful of foundations.
</p>
<p style>
There is nothing <em>necessarily</em> wrong with this setup — and, of
course, an equivalent network devoted to stopping and delaying climate
policy exists to rival it on the right. But the entire design places an
enormous amount of faith in the leaders of these nonprofits and
foundations, and in the social strata that they occupy. If a nonprofit
messes up, then only public attention or press coverage can right the
ship. And there is simply not enough of either resource to keep these
things on track.
</p>
<p style>
That leads to odd resource allocation decisions, business units that
seem to have no purpose (alongside teams that seem perpetually
overworked), and decisions that frame otherwise decent policies in
politically unpalatable ways. It regularly burns out people involved in
climate organizations. And it means that much of the climate movement’s
strategy is controlled by foundation officials and nonprofit directors.
Like any other group of executives, these people are capable of deluding
themselves about what is happening in the world; <em>unlike </em>other
types of leaders, however, they face neither an angry electorate nor a
ruthless market that will force them to update their worldview. The risk
exists, then, that they could blunder into disaster — and take the
climate movement with them.

<p>While Elementary OS commits to Wayland, the development team of the
Budgie desktop is changing course and will work with the Xfce developers
toward Budgie’s Wayland future. There is general consensus now that the
future of graphical desktops on Linux lies in Wayland rather than X11,
but the path is still not a smooth and easy one. While in Latvia for the
Ubuntu Summit, the Reg FOSS desk met with the developers behind Ubuntu
Budgie, who told us that the Budgie project is charting a new course
toward the brave new Wayland world. It seems that using EFL – the
Enlightenment Foundation Libraries – wasn’t the right choice for Budgie,
and so they’re now exploring working with Xfce on their Wayland efforts,
instead. Considering Enlightenment’s desktop Linux presence is
negligible, at best, joining forces with Xfce so that both Xfce and
Budgie can make progress on Wayland faster seems like the more optimal
choice for the wider desktop Linux community.</p>

<h2
id="solar-panels-over-canals-in-gila-river-indian-community-will-help-save-water">Solar
Panels Over Canals in Gila River Indian Community Will Help Save
Water</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>In a move that may soon be replicated elsewhere, the Gila River
Indian Community recently signed an agreement with the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers to put solar panels over a stretch of irrigation canal on
its land south of Phoenix.</p>
<p>It will be the first project of its kind in the United States to
break ground, according to the tribe’s press release.</p>
<p>“This was a historic moment here for the community but also for the
region and across Indian Country,” said Gila River Indian Community
Governor Stephen Roe Lewis in a video published on X, formerly known as
Twitter.</p>
<p>The first phase, set to be completed in 2025, will cover 1,000 feet
of canal and generate one megawatt of electricity that the tribe will
use to irrigate crops, including feed for livestock, cotton and
grains.</p>
<p>The idea is simple: install solar panels over canals in sunny,
water-scarce regions where they reduce evaporation and make renewable
electricity.</p>
<p>“We’re proud to be leaders in water conservation, and this project is
going to do just that,” Lewis said, noting the significance of a Native,
sovereign, tribal nation leading on the technology.</p>
<p>A study by the University of California, Merced estimated that 63
billion gallons of water could be saved annually by covering
California’s 4,000 miles of canals. More than 100 climate advocacy
groups are advocating for just that.</p>
<p>Researchers believe that much of the installed solar canopies would
additionally generate a significant amount of electricity.</p>
<p>UC Merced wants to hone its initial estimate and should soon have the
chance. Not far away in California’s Central Valley, the Turlock
Irrigation District and partner Solar AquaGrid plan to construct 1.6
miles (2.6 kilometers) of solar canopies over its canals beginning this
spring and researchers will study the benefits.</p>
<p>Neither the Gila River Indian Community nor the Turlock Irrigation
District are the first to implement this technology globally. Indian
engineering firm Sun Edison inaugurated the first solar-covered canal in
2012 on one of the largest irrigation projects in the world in Gujarat
state. Despite ambitious plans to cover 11,800 miles (19,000 kilometers)
of canals, only a handful of small projects ever went up, and the
engineering firm filed for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>High capital costs, clunky design and maintenance challenges were
obstacles for widespread adoption, experts say.</p>
<p>But severe, prolonged drought in the western U.S. has centered water
as a key political issue, heightening interest in technologies like
cloud seeding and solar-covered canals as water managers grasp at any
solution that might buoy reserves, even ones that haven’t been widely
tested, or tested at all.</p>
<p>Still, the project is an important indicator of the tribe’s
commitment to water conservation, said Heather Tanana, a visiting law
professor at the University of California, Irvine and citizen of the
Navajo Nation. Tribes hold the most senior water rights on the Colorado
River, though many are still settling those rights in court.</p>
<p>“There’s so much fear about the tribes asserting their rights and if
they do so, it’ll pull from someone else’s rights,” she said. The tribe
leaving water in Lake Mead and putting federal dollars toward projects
like solar canopies is “a great example to show that fear is
unwarranted.”</p>
<p>The federal government has made record funding available for
water-saving projects, including a $233 million pact with the Gila River
Indian Community to conserve about two feet of water in Lake Mead, the
massive and severely depleted reservoir on the Colorado River. Phase one
of the solar canal project will cost $6.7 million and the Bureau of
Reclamation provided $517,000 for the design.</p>

<h2 id="federal-appeals-court-deals-blow-to-voting-rights-act">Federal
Appeals Court Deals Blow to Voting Rights Act</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A divided federal appeals court Monday ruled that private individuals
and groups such as the NAACP do not have the ability to sue under a key
section of the federal Voting Rights Act, a decision voting rights
advocates say could further erode protections under the landmark 1965
law.</p>
<p>The 2-1 decision by a panel of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals based
in St. Louis found that only the U.S. attorney general can enforce
Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits discriminatory
voting practices such as racially gerrymandered districts.</p>
<p>The majority said other federal laws, including the 1964 Civil Rights
Act, make it clear when private groups can sue said but similar wording
is not found in the voting law.</p>
<p>“When those details are missing, it is not our place to fill in the
gaps, except when ‘text and structure’ require it,” U.S. Circuit Judge
David R. Stras wrote for the majority in an opinion joined by Judge
Raymond W. Gruender. Stras was nominated by former President Donald
Trump and Gruender by former President George W. Bush.</p>
<p>The decision affirmed a lower judge’s decision to dismiss a case
brought by the Arkansas State Conference NAACP and the Arkansas Public
Policy Panel after giving U.S. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland five
days to join the lawsuit. Neither organization immediately returned
messages seeking comment Monday.</p>
<p>Chief Judge Lavenski R. Smith noted in a dissenting opinion that
federal courts across the country and the U.S. Supreme Court have
considered numerous cases brought by private plaintiffs under Section 2.
Smith said the court should follow “existing precedent that permits a
judicial remedy” unless the Supreme Court or Congress decides
differently.</p>
<p>“Rights so foundational to self-government and citizenship should not
depend solely on the discretion or availability of the government’s
agents for protection,” wrote Smith, another appointee of George W.
Bush.</p>
<p>The ruling applies only to federal courts covered by the 8th Circuit,
which includes Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North
Dakota and South Dakota. Meanwhile, several pending lawsuits by private
groups challenge various political maps drawn by legislators across the
country.</p>
<p>A representative for the Justice Department declined to comment.</p>

<p>I won’t pretend to know what the hell is happening at OpenAI. The
story is changing by the hour. It’s chaos though. And that’s a good
thing. For the past few years, OpenAI has told a near-perfect story: The
company was founded by tech luminaries — people skilled at noticing
developing technologies and operating as though the future had already
arrived. They recognized that we were on the cusp of a breakthrough that
would transform, well,</p>

Pope Francis is heading to this year’s COP summit in Dubai next week,
fresh off releasing an encyclical, <em>Laudate Deum,</em> that takes
wealthy countries to task for their failure to curb greenhouse gas
emissions. NPR dedicated its
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/11/19/1214089992/pope-francis-climate-activist" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sunday
cover story on <em>All Things Considered</em></a> to the new document,
and I highly recommend you listen to the whole segment. Christiana
Zenner, a Fordham University professor who’s studied the pope’s writings
on climate change, described the publication as a follow-up to
<em>Laudato Si</em>, his 2015 encyclical that first mentioned climate
change. But whereas <em>Laudato Si</em> was, in Zenner’s words,
“reflective, rhapsodic and almost devotional,” this year’s is focused
solely on climate change — and far more critical. This quote in
particular stood out:
</p>
<blockquote>
The [Pope] in this document thinks that almost everything hinges on the
success of the upcoming COP meeting, which is partly why he’s going
there. It’s partly why he released this document, and it’s partly why,
in this document, he is hypercritical of Western developed —
hyperdeveloped — nations in particular, who, in his view, have become
complacent and not lived up to the responsibility that is properly
theirs on the world stage for leading on climate remediation and all
sorts of related questions. <br/> <br/> You know, it is no accident how
this document is constructed. He starts out by citing the U.S. bishops
on climate change. And that’s a brilliantly underhanded move in some
ways, brilliantly rhetorical move, because he then turns back at the end
of the encyclical to say, you know, consumption, overconsumption in
particular, is most pronounced in the United States. And so in paragraph
72, he says, “If we consider that emissions per individual in the United
States are about two times greater than those of individuals living in
China, and seven times greater than the average of the poorest
countries, we can see [sic]…” and he goes on to talk about critiques of
Western consuming lifestyles. So there’s this kind of parabolic
beginning and return to the question of how climate change is framed in
the West and the failure of leadership to really address these
questions.
</blockquote>
<p style>
Francis will address world leaders on Dec. 2. In the meantime, you can

Mullenweg</a>: “Sales of the 100-year plan so far: 0. Hundreds of people
filled out the form, though. I think we really messed something up in
the follow-up, including not making it self-serve to start. Will review
and try again. It’s an important promise to us.”
</p>
<p>
I’m very much a customer for this service. It would be worth $10K for to
buy 100 years of persistence for my web writing. A simple easy to
understand service that helps get the process started.

<ul>
<li>
I transfer <a href="http://scripting.com/">scripting.com</a> to
Automattic as registrar.
</li>
<li>
I upload the contents from S3 to Automattic server. Static files, HTML,
feeds, images, code.
</li>
<li>
Automattic provides an API to keep the files updated and so I can add to
them as long as I’m still writing.
</li>
<li>
The files are publicly accessible over HTTP.
</li>
<li>
Automattic agrees to renew the domain for 100 years, and manage access
to the files, with reasonable limits and acts of god accounted for, etc.

<li>
I pay you $10K on signing.

</ul>
<p>
Why should you do it – simple, easy benefit, i think you’d sell a lot of
contracts, and you could start the business now, and get started serving
customers and learning what they want, how they work, and get ideas for
where to go next.

<h2 id="wie-viel-geschichte-braucht-die-welt">Wie viel Geschichte
braucht die Welt?</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-20, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Wie viel Geschichte braucht die Welt?
</h1>
<p>
(Ich rede natürlich von der Welt im Rollenspiel und vom meinen
<a href="/pdfs/Horte.pdf">Horte</a> Traktat im besonderen.)
</p>
<p>
Die Geschichte ist nur insofern relevant, als sie als Inspiration für
alte Ruinen und magische Gegenstände dient, auf Buchtiteln und
Inschriften erwähnt wird. Ein genauer Zeitstrahl ist nicht wichtig,
ausser man ist Gelehrter statt Abenteurer.
</p>
<p>
Die Kriege liefern beispielsweise die “Erklärung” für gewisse
<a href="2023-11-18-magische-waffen">magische Waffen</a> – und umgekehrt
verleihen die Zusätze bei den magischen Waffen der Welt etwas Tiefe. Das
ist, wie wenn man von Geschichte keine Ahnung hat und zum ersten Mal von
den Kriegen unserer Welt hört.
</p>
<h3>
Kriege der Vergangenheit
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Drachenkriege</em>, als Elfen gegen Drachen gekämpft haben; so
sollen die Elfen die erste Magie gelernt haben
</li>
<li>
<em>Echsenkriege</em> oder <em>Die Dunklen Tage</em>, als gegen
Schlangenmenschen und Nagas aus Myrkheim gekämpft wurde; hier wurden die
Zugänge zu den anderen Welten entdeckt
</li>
<li>
<em>Befreiungskriege</em>, als gegen die Echsenmensche und ihre Magie
gekämpft wurde; hier ist die Zivilisation der Echsenmenschen
untergegangen
</li>
<li>
<em>Waldkriege</em>, als Elfen und Baumhirten gegen Maschinenbau und
Stahl gekämpft haben; das ist der Grund, warum die grossen Maschinen
nicht mehr funktionieren und das Wissen um die Mechanik verloren
gegangen ist
</li>
<li>
<em>Philosophenkriege</em>, als Sprengstoff und Maschinen gegen
Magieschulen und Tempelherrschaft gekämpft haben; deswegen gibt es nun
überall Magie und Aberglauben, Götteranbetung und Wunder
</li>
<li>
<em>Vampirkriege</em>, als gegen Vampire aus Niflheim gekämpft wurde;
deswegen ist klar, dass die Vampire bis ans Ender der Zeit die Feinde
der Menschheit sind
</li>
<li>
<em>Winterkriege</em> oder <em>Das Jahr ohne Sommer</em>, als gegen
Frostriesen und Eiswölfe gekämpft wurde; deswegen ist der Übergang in
die Welt von Eis und Schnee noch so oft möglich
</li>
<li>
<em>Befreiungskriege</em>, <em>Die Landnahme</em>, <em>Der
Aufstand</em>, <em>Die Schweinekriege</em> und andere Kriege der Orks;
dies erklärt die grosse Feindschaft zwischen Menschen und Orks, da die
Missverständnisse, Ungerechtigkeiten und Gräueltaten seit Jahrhunderten
nicht enden wollen
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Reiche der Nekromantie
</h3>
<p>
Dies sind die Hexen und Nekromanten, die zur Unsterblichkeit gefunden
haben und sich dann bekriegt haben. Ihnen ist gemeinsam, dass sie an
Pässen Wachtürme gebaut haben, die durch Zauberei geschützt waren,
flammende Inschriften bezeugen noch immer alte Grenzen und untote
Wächter bewachen noch immer die alten Zugänge.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Alice</em>, Herrin über die Kinder, der Geist sie knechtete
</li>
<li>
<em>Childebert</em>, Herr der Schlachtfelder, wo er die Toten wieder
erweckt hat
</li>
<li>
<em>Constance</em>, Herrin der Zeit, die Freunde und Feinde in gläserne
Särge goss
</li>
<li>
<em>Galswintha</em>, Herrin von Schlaf und Benebelung, Lähmung und
Unfruchtbarkeit
</li>
<li>
<em>Gundobad</em>, Herr des Wahnsinns, grosser Expedition, die allesamt
verloren gingen
</li>
<li>
<em>Gundred</em>, Herrin der Opfer und der Scheiterhaufen, dem Land der
Asche
</li>
<li>
<em>Herlewin</em>, Herr der Verträge, Seelenkäufer und Teufelsanbeter
</li>
<li>
<em>Isolda</em>, Herrin der verlorenen Seelen, der hoffnungslosen Liebe
und ewiger Melancholie
</li>
<li>
<em>Osbert</em>, Herr der eifrigen Jugend, der Irreführung, der Kriege
und der Massaker
</li>
<li>
<em>Sybilla</em>, Herrin der Prophezeiung, die immer wusste, wo ihre
Feinde waren, und so dort hat umbringen lassen

Larry Summers’ inflation scare-talk incinerated climate action (20 Nov
2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-20, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Larry Summers’ inflation scare-talk incinerated climate
action: Now can we please stop listening to this ghoul? Hey look at
this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2008, 2013, 2018, 2022
Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current
writing projects, current reading Larry Summers’ inflation scare-talk
incinerated climate action (permalink) Economists tell us that the
market can remain irrational longer than we can remain solvent, but how
long can economists remain irrational? Judging from the inflation scare
we just lived through, the answer appears to be “longer than you can
remain solvent.” Experts of all description are prone to enduring folly
in which the failure of some cherished intervention triggers more of
that intervention. This is the famed “doing the same thing but expecting
different results” and it’s a grand American tradition. Take
bloodletting, a therapy that does not work and that only makes things
worse, but which nevertheless served as the first recourse for “doctors”
for centuries. Patients who worsened after a bloodletting were presumed
to be undertreated, so their doctors would bleed them again, and again.
Every turn for the worse was evidence of the need for more bleeding. If
you grew up in America, you doubtless learned a lot about George
Washington – even apocryphal stories about his boyhood, like the
cherry-tree incident:
https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/cherry-tree-myth/
You know all about Washington, from his wooden teeth to his military
victories. Lin-Manuel Miranda’s ballad made Washington’s dream of a life
spent “under his own vine and fig-tree” famous:
https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/vine-and-fig-tree/
But it’s very unlikely that you heard about how George Washington died.
After eating dinner in cold, wet clothes, he developed a vicious cold. A
succession of doctors attended Washington, each one bleeding him, until
more than half of Washington’s blood had been extracted, whereupon the
country’s father died:
https://timharford.com/2023/11/cautionary-tales-george-washingtons-beard-of-beetles-with-the-dollop/
Today, a different kind of quack is given free rein to bleed another
Washington: central bankers like Jerome Powell sit in DC, bleeding the
economy with interest rate hikes, in the name of preventing inflation:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/14/medieval-bloodletters/#its-the-stupid-economy
The theory goes: the government gave the poors too much money in the
form of covid relief. That made working people lazy and feckless. The
proles’ fat cash cushions let them demand unrealistically high wages,
and this is driving up the price of goods. To solve this, we need to
destroy lots of jobs, so workers will bid against each other for the
remaining, scarce gigs, until wages go down. Even a cursory examination
of the facts revealed this theory’s hollowness. Even as the Fed was
cranking up interest rates in October 2022, real wages were 2.3% lower
than they’d been a year before:
https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RI_CausesofandResponsestoTodaysInflation_Report_202212.pdf
Prices did rise, of course, but there was no evidence that they rose
because of greedy workers. Some of that price-rise was due to covid
shocks – a drop in the ability to make things because of lockdowns. Some
was due to war-shocks – disruptions to energy and food supplies
following from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Some was due to changes in
what we wanted to buy (high demand for work-from-home equipment, changes
to the rental market as people moved out of cities). But one undeniable
factor was price-gouging. The CEOs of large companies have spent the
past two years boasting to shareholders on their earnings calls about
how all the scare-talk about inflation let them hike prices and blame
the Biden administration:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/23/cant-make-an-omelet/#keep-calm-and-crack-on
It takes a deliberate act of will to see energy companies hiking prices
and raising prices and decide that the real problem is workers have too
much money, and that the solution cannot under any circumstances involve
a tax of those “windfall” profits:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/03/15/sanctions-financing/#soak-the-rich Or
breaking up monopolies:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/02/its-the-economy-stupid/#overinflated
But some people want to see workers suffer. Well, at least one person
wants workers to suffer. Larry Summers, the Clintonite ghoul who led the
charge on punishing workers to fight inflation:

Summers is a man who is wrong about a lot of things. Like, when he was
president of Harvard, he was wrong about women’s natural incapacity to
do science:
https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/jan/18/educationsgendergap.genderissues
That had a lot of consequences, as did Summers’ economic guidance when
he served as Treasury Secretary under Bill Clinton. But the fully
operational battle station version of Larry Summers emerged when he
became a talking head, helping to sabotage the Biden Administration’s
ability to continue providing relief during the pandemic. Summers’ pitch
went like this: inflation is caused by workers having too much money,
and anyone who disagrees with me is a sentimental lackwit who doesn’t
understand the Science of Economics:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/20/quiet-part-out-loud/#profiteering
Summers’ confident pronouncements about the enduring, structural nature
of inflation were used as ammo for all kinds of cuts in the Biden
agenda, and were used to argue against student debt cancellation.
According to Summers, we just can’t have nice things, and if we do, we
risk hyperinflation and the collapse of the US dollar:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/01/mayday/#inflationary-political-economy
Not only was Summers wrong, but his prescriptions also scuttled wildly
popular moves that could turn out voters for larger Dem majorities in
the Senate and retaking the House, enabling even more muscular action.
Summers’ argument fails on its own terms, too. If inflation is “too many
dollars chasing too few goods,” then one way to solve inflation is to
increase America’s capacity to fulfill demand. You know, by educating
people, investing in infrastructure, re-shoring critical manufacturing,
and so on:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/06/01/factories-to-condos-pipeline/#stuff-not-money
Some of the steepest inflation Americans experienced came from
nondiscretionary spending: on healthcare, childcare, long-term care,
rehab, etc. This is “care inflation,” and you don’t reduce demand for it
by hurting workers:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/18/wages-for-housework/#low-wage-workers-vs-poor-consumers
The price of care labor has outpaced the CPI every year since 1978. As
the price of goes up, working-age adults are taken out of the workforce
so they can care for their kids, parents, spouses, and other family
members:
https://prospect.org/economy/2023-01-18-inflation-unfair-costs-of-care/
This reduces America’s capacity, removing skilled workers from the
workforce. In other words, to increase its capacity, America needs to
increase social spending, not reduce it. Instead, we’re allowing private
equity funds to “roll up” (that is, monopolize) the care sector, raising
prices and slashing wages. The quality of care goes down, and the price
goes up. You know – inflation:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/16/schumpeterian-terrorism/#deliberately-broken
Larry Summers was wrong about inflation. Don’t take it from me: just ask
Larry Summers! He’s now saying that inflation is over, it was
“transitory” and it was caused by supply chain problems, not giving the
poors too much money:
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/summers-says-transitory-factors-behind-001613380.html
As David Dayen writes for The American Prospect, Larry Summers’ latest
pronouncements conspicuously fail to reckon with Larry Summers’ greatest
detractor: Larry Summers, who spent years calling covid relief “the
least responsible economic policy in 40 years”:
https://prospect.org/environment/2023-11-20-larry-summers-inflation-prediction-climate-change/
Summers’ delusion was anything but harmless. He and his fellow
interest-rate hawks provided cover for the Feds’ brutal rate-hikes,
which led to steep cuts to planned solar, geothermal, wind, and grid
investments. Alternative energy companies went from profitable to
unprofitable overnight:
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4650157-plug-power-q3-earnings-on-verge-of-failure-sell
Giant offshore wind projects were canceled. This is the cancel culture
no one is talking about:
https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/business/energy-environment/offshore-wind-farm-new-jersey.html
Heat-pump retrofitting is behind schedule:
https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/business/energy-environment/heat-pumps-biden-tax-credits-rebates.html
As Dayen says, “The Inflation Reduction Act is effectively being offset
by interest costs.” (Image: mosaic36, Chatham House, CC BY 2.0,

<h2 id="cheap-backups">Cheap backups</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-20, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Cheap backups
</h1>
<p>
Every day is backup day. I use BorgBackup to backup up my laptop to one
of two external disks. One of these is always at the office, so there
are three copies: on my laptop, on a backup disk at home and on a backup
disk at the office. It’s important that those three are never in the
same location.
</p>
<p>
I do concede, however, that it’s tricky setup.
</p>
<p>
For my wife, I’ve set up the Mac to backup the laptop and an external
disk with media files to one of two external disks. Again, one of these
is always at the office. So, same deal, except now I’m using TimeMachine
instead of BorgBackup. Somehow, that makes it take a very long time. But
it seems to work.
</p>
<p>
Still, plugging in backup disks, carrying them to the office, bringing
the other one back, plugging it in again… as you can imagine, we don’t
do this nearly often enough.
</p>
<p>
So I need a quick way to backup stuff. Like, super quick. Super cheap.
</p>
<p>
The simplest option I can think of is to use rsync on the local disk
because it has an option to create links for files ­– and while a link
doesn’t take zero space, it takes a lot less space than making a copy.
</p>
<p>
So what I wanted was a quick command that I can run in the directory I’m
in and it creates a backup using rsync.
</p>
<p>
I’ve used the following bash script. Let me know if it can be improved.
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/bash
d=$(basename $(pwd))
t=$(date --iso-8601)
echo Creating a snapshot of $d in ../$d-$t
rsync --link-dest &quot;../$d&quot; --archive . &quot;../$d-$t/&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>
That is, if the current directory is <code>/home/alex/src/wiki</code>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
it creates the backup in <code>/home/alex/src/wiki-2023-11-19</code>
(appending today’s date)
</li>
<li>
from there, the links all point to the original (where the command was
invoked)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
When I use <code>ls -l</code>, this is what it looks like:
</p>
<pre><code>drwxr-xr-x 67 alex alex 749568 18. Nov 23:56 wiki/
drwxr-xr-x 67 alex alex 548864 17. Okt 23:43 wiki-2023-10-17/
drwxr-xr-x 67 alex alex 548864 19. Okt 22:47 wiki-2023-10-19/
drwxr-xr-x 67 alex alex 552960 30. Okt 13:18 wiki-2023-10-30/
</code></pre>
<p>
It’s not great, but it works.
</p>
<p>
For a file that hasn’t changed, you’ll see that <code>ls -l</code> says
there are four links to this file. This is correct: one link for every
directory. The data exists only once, on the disk.
</p>
<pre><code>&gt; ls -l w*/2000-03-10_Elendor.md 
-rw-r--r-- 4 alex alex 16313 28. Apr 2017  wiki/2000-03-10_Elendor.md
-rw-r--r-- 4 alex alex 16313 28. Apr 2017  wiki-2023-10-17/2000-03-10_Elendor.md
-rw-r--r-- 4 alex alex 16313 28. Apr 2017  wiki-2023-10-19/2000-03-10_Elendor.md
-rw-r--r-- 4 alex alex 16313 28. Apr 2017  wiki-2023-10-30/2000-03-10_Elendor.md
</code></pre>
<p>
For a file that changes all the time, <code>ls -l</code> shows that
there is just one link for every file, meaning that these files are
distinct. And for a lay person, that is confirmed by the different file
size and last modified timestamp.
</p>
<pre><code>&gt; ls -l w*/changes.md
-rw-r--r-- 1 alex alex 1997 17. Okt 16:28 wiki-2023-10-17/changes.md
-rw-r--r-- 1 alex alex 2123 19. Okt 22:36 wiki-2023-10-19/changes.md

Limitations
</h2>
<p>
As
<a class="account" href="https://functional.cafe/@edavies" title="@edavies@functional.cafe"><span
class="citation" data-cites="edavies">@edavies</span></a> and
<a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Sandra">@Sandra</span></a> have pointed
out, this only works if the editing you do always recreates the files
you’re editing (because then these files get a new inode even if their
names stay the same). Examples where this is a problem: database files
are updated in place; some editors allow you to decide how backups are
created. Emacs, for example, has the option
<code>backup-by-copying</code> which is nil by default. When you save a
file, the original is renamed to the backup and a new file is written.
If you set the option, however, the backup is copied first, and then the
original is changed in-place (like a database file, without getting a
new inode). Now you’ve changed the file in all the “cheap backup”
directories, since the links keep pointing to the same inode and that
inode now points to the new file.
</p>
<p>
Possibly a better solution that uses copies for the first backup and
then future backups link to the old backups (and never to the originals)
would be the following:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/bash
d=$(basename $(pwd))
t=$(date --iso-8601)
p=$(find .. -maxdepth 1 -type d -name &quot;$d-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]&quot; -prune | sort | tail -n 1)
if [ -z &quot;$p&quot; ]; then
  echo Creating a snapshot of $d in ../$d-$t
  rsync --archive . &quot;../$d-$t/&quot;
else
  echo Creating a snapshot of $d in ../$d-$t with links into $p
  rsync --link-dest &quot;$p&quot; --archive . &quot;../$d-$t/&quot;
fi
</code></pre>
<p>
Note that now, in case you just need a single backup, you might just as
well just make a copy using your favourite file manager. Not so cheap
any more, eh? 🤨

<p>
<a class="account" href="https://functional.cafe/@edavies" title="@edavies@functional.cafe"><span

following script for a use case for <code>/home</code>,
<code>/etc</code> and <code>/usr/local</code> to a 1TB hard drive by the

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

id="trump-lawyers-urge-court-to-revoke-gag-order-in-dc-election-case">Trump
Lawyers Urge Court to Revoke Gag Order in DC Election Case</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Lawyers for former President Donald Trump urged a federal appeals
court on Monday to revoke a gag order in the federal case charging him
with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential
election.</p>
<p>“The order is unprecedented and it sets a terrible precedent for
future restrictions on core political speech,” Trump attorney John Sauer
told a three-judge panel.</p>
<p>Prosecutors with special counsel Jack Smith’s team, meanwhile, are
urging the court to put back in place an order barring the Republican
former president from making inflammatory statements about potential
witnesses and lawyers in the case.</p>
<p>The prosecutors say those restrictions are necessary to prevent Trump
from undermining confidence in the court system and intimidating people
who may be called to testify against him. Defense lawyers call the gag
order an unconstitutional muzzling of Trump’s free speech rights and say
prosecutors have presented no evidence to support the idea that his
words have caused harm or made anyone feel threatened.</p>
<p>During arguments Monday, Trump lawyer Sauer called the gag order a
“heckler’s veto,” unfairly relying on the theory that Trump’s speech
might someday inspire other people to harass or intimidate his
targets.</p>
<p>The gag order is one of multiple contentious issues being argued
ahead of the landmark March 2024 trial. Defense lawyers are also trying
to get the case dismissed by arguing that Trump, as a former president,
is immune from prosecution and protected by the First Amendment from
being charged. The outcome of Monday’s arguments won’t affect those
constitutional claims, but it will set parameters on what Trump as both
a criminal defendant and leading presidential candidate can and cannot
say ahead of the trial.</p>
<p>The order has had a whirlwind trajectory through the courts since
U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan imposed it last month in response to a
request from prosecutors, who cited among other comments Trump’s
repeated disparagement of Smith as “deranged.”</p>
<p>The judge lifted it days after entering it, giving Trump’s lawyers
time to prove why his words should not be restricted. But after Trump
took advantage of that pause by posting on social media comments that
prosecutors said were meant to sway his former chief of staff against
giving unfavorable testimony, Chutkan put it back in place.</p>
<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit later
lifted it as it considered Trump’s appeal.</p>
<p>The judges hearing the case include Cornelia Pillard and Patricia
Millett, both appointees of President Barack Obama, and Brad Garcia, who
joined the bench earlier this year after being nominated by President
Joe Biden. Obama and Biden are Democrats.</p>
<p>The panel is not expected to immediately rule on Monday. Should the
judges rule against Trump, he’ll have the option of asking the entire
court to take up the matter. His lawyers have also signaled that they’ll
ask the Supreme Court to get involved.</p>
<p>The four-count indictment in Washington is one of four criminal cases
Trump faces as he seeks to reclaim the White House in 2024.</p>
<p>He’s been charged in Florida, also by Smith’s team, with illegally
hoarding dozens of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm
Beach, Florida. He’s also been charged in state court in New York in
connection with hush money payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels, who
alleged an extramarital affair with him, and in Georgia with scheming to
subvert the 2020 presidential election in that state. He has denied
doing anything wrong.</p>

how Symbian Anna tried to bring an old OS into the modern touchscreen
world</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today we want to focus on what came next, Symbian Anna, which arrived
a year after the launch of Symbian^3 (Symbian^2 launched only in Japan).
Anna was unveiled in early 2011 alongside the Nokia X7 and Nokia E6. The
E6 was a bar phone with a QWERTY keyboard (and a 2.45″ touch display),
but the X7 was all touch (4.0″ display). Even better, owners of certain
older Nokias would receive Anna as an update, that was the case for the
Nokia N8 and E7. The Nokia C7 and C6-01 got it too. I have a few Symbian
Anna and Belle (its successor) devices, and they’re not exactly great.
The software is slow, cumbersome, clunky, and unpleasant to use, and
simply no competition for the iPhone and Android, even at the time they
came out. They’re fun novelties to play with now, but I genuinely feel
sorry for the people who bought into these things back when they were
new, thinking they’d get something on the level of the iPhone or
Android.</p>

<h2 id="openbsd-formal-driver-verification-with-sel4">OpenBSD formal
driver verification with SeL4</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>The seL4 microkernel is currently the only kernel that has been fully
formally verified. In general, the increased interest in ensuring the
security of a kernel’s code results from its important role in the
entire operating system. One of the basic features of an operating
system is that it abstracts the handling of devices. This abstraction is
represented by device drivers – the software that manages the hardware.
A proper verification of the software component could ensure that the
device would work properly unless there is a hardware failure. In this
paper, we choose to model the behavior of a device driver and build the
proof that the code implementation matches the expected behavior. The
proof was written in Isabelle/HOL, the code translation from C to
Isabelle was done automatically by the use of the C-to-Isabelle Parser
and AutoCorres tools. We choose Isabelle theorem prover because its
efficiency was already shown through the verification of seL4
microkernel. Some light reading that would’ve been for the weekend had I
not gotten sick and unable to work on OSNews much.</p>

<p class="drop-caps" style>
It was questionable if we needed a second season of <em>Tiger King</em>
— or, let’s be honest, a <em>first</em> season. Regardless, if Netflix
ever decides it’s interested in a story that features surprisingly
charming criminals, IWT violations, and yes, even possibly murder (but
<em>without</em> the tabloid tone and mullets), producers might look in
the future to Jared D. Margulies’ delightful debut,
<a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/the-cactus-hunters" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The
Cactus Hunters: Desire and Extinction in the Illicit Succulent
Trade</em></a><em>. </em>
</p>
<p style>
<em>Wait, illicit </em>succulent<em> trade? </em>you might be wondering.
Oh yes.
</p>
<p style>
From the cliffs of California and the deserts of Brazil to the markets
of Seoul and the private greenhouses of Czechia, Margulies follows the
extraction and relocation of plants so rare that they might only exist
in one valley or mountainside in the world. Weaving in ample philosophy
and research about what drives these sorts of obsessions — as well as
his personal reflections as he, in turn, is captivated by the lovable,
spiky plants — <em>The Cactus Hunters</em> is just the right balance of
edgy and academic.
</p>
<p style>
Last week, I caught up with Margulies about the process of researching
the book, being mistaken for an undercover cop by his subjects, and the
lie that is “the green thumb,” among other topics. Our conversation has
been edited and condensed for clarity.
</p>
<p style>
<strong>You open <em>The Cactus Hunters</em> with a story about how you
were going to study the illegal trade of tiger bones when you came
across a story about
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/20/to-catch-a-cactus-thief-national-parks-fight-a-thorny-problem" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">saguaro
cactus rustling</a> that piqued your interest and sent you on this
journey. What most stands out to you as the differences between the
illegal trade of animals and animal products and the world of illegal
cactus trading?</strong>
</p>
<p>
To clarify, I never actually got around to studying the illegal trade in
tiger bones. I had encountered it a little bit in my past research on
human-wildlife conflicts.
</p>
<p style>
But there are a lot of important differences: One of the things that
made the illegal plant trade so interesting to study, compared to
illegal trade in animals, is that it receives a lot less attention, so
there was just a lot more to learn that people hadn’t already
researched. But also, the way that this material and these plants can
move around the world — there are so many more options available because
of the nature of plants. So if what you’re after is the genetics of the
plant, to be able to grow them somewhere else in the world, there’s not
just the <em>one plant</em> but there’s the cacti propagate, for
instance.
<a href="https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/ornamental/cacti-succulents/scgen/removing-cactus-pups.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pups</a>.
Their seeds. You can make cuttings of plants. None of these things are
really available to people interested in illegal trade and animals. That
affects supply chains and how these things can move around the world.
</p>
<p>
Also, because of the lack of attention to illegal plant trade compared
to animal trade, the subject is a lot less criminalized. I would argue
that my access to informants and research participants was a lot better
because it did happen that, every now and then, people thought I was a
cop. Or maybe, like, an undercover detective. But usually within pretty
short order, they realized that wasn’t the case and I was generally
interested in trying to understand their perspectives. I think that it
would be a lot harder to develop trust within certain trades that are a
lot more heavily criminalized.
</p>
<p style>
<strong>Over the course of the book, you encounter the Indiana Jones of
plants and the Robin Hood of cacti, among others. Can you talk a little
about why these enthusiasts, who clearly care deeply about conservation,
sometimes break the law by smuggling seeds or entire cacti out of the
places where they naturally grow?</strong>
</p>
<p style>
One of the fascinating things that really gripped me was this seeming
contradiction, where you have people who are made out as conservation
villains by certain actors seeing themselves as unsung conservation
heroes. The reason for that is, for a lot of these collectors, they saw
their community as really passionate people who wanted to get access to
the plants that become objects of their desires. By and large, the
people who want these plants aren’t trying to do harm to the species in
the world, and they care a lot about them. But they also recognize that
in their desire is something fairly insatiable and that people are going
to go to lengths to get the plant that they have to go to.
</p>
<p style>
For a lot of these collectors, they might see engaging in a kind of
illegal activity as still a socially acceptable behavior, if it meant it
got material out into the world in a way that people might want it. And
the goal there, the long-term goal, is to try to reduce demand on wild
harvesting of plants and wild populations. If you get a little bit of
material out into the communities that delight in these plants, then you
can start grafting them, propagating them, growing them from seed, and,
in theory, get that material out into the world.
</p>
<p style>
I wanted to take that perspective seriously. It’s a hard thing to study
empirically and so it was important for me to try to be open to a really
diverse set of opinions about the right way to do conservation.
</p>
<p style>
<strong>You leave most of the sources in the book, including those
working within the law, anonymous. Why did you make that
decision?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The really short answer is, I was part of a larger research project
called
<a href="https://biosec.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/the-team/professor-rosaleen-duffy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BIOSEC</a>,
which was run by Professor Rosaleen Duffy at the University of Sheffield
in the Department of Politics and International Relations, and we were
using a fairly symmetrical ethics approval process, or what in the U.S.
we would call an institutional review board approval. Because a number
of us were studying illicit economies, in order to ensure
research-subject protection and anonymity and security, we were required
to make all of our sources anonymous.
</p>
<p style>
But this caused some issues because, on the one hand, it meant that
everyone in the book is anonymous, even if they’re people who are law
enforcement officials or botanists who would have probably really
enjoyed having their names in the book. I regret that.
</p>
<p style>
Most interesting, though, were the number of collectors who were mad at
me because they’re also anonymous. One of the reasons for that was they
saw anonymity as being suggestive of wrongdoing and for a lot of these
people, they don’t feel like what they’re doing is wrong, necessarily,
even if it’s against the law. They wanted their story told. I think one
of the reasons I had good access to the kinds of interlocutors I had was
because they felt like I was providing a space for them to get their
version of the story out into the world.
</p>
<p style>
<strong>You were asked to be an expert witness in a case against a South
Korean smuggler who took thousands of plants from the California coast.
How do you navigate moments like this, when your position as an illicit
trade researcher is perhaps in tension with your own ethical
code?</strong>
</p>
<p>
This was a really difficult decision for me, and I write about this. I
went back and forth about whether or not to serve as an expert witness,
which in this case just required writing a statement. I never had to go
to court or, you know, be on a witness stand — thank goodness. But I go
back and forth about if I would do it again.
</p>
<p style>
I think that in the end, I chose to do it because I realized that my
testimony would only serve to probably reduce the sentence that this
person was facing. And I don’t say that because I think that what they
were doing was okay. It was really bad and really harmful to this
species of plant. I just don’t think that criminalization and
incarceration actually do rehabilitative work or serve much function. It
costs us a lot of money as taxpayers and causes harm.
</p>
<p style>
It was complicated; I guess that’s how I would leave it. I debated
whether or not to include [the story] in the book but I felt like, in
the end, it would be wrong not to include it. I think that if people
eventually found out I had served in that capacity, they might felt like
I was trying to not disclose something. But yeah, I have some ambiguous
feelings about it. In the end, what I was asked to actually do was very
limited: I was just asked to put a value on these plants. But as I wrote
in my letter to the judge, that value in monetary terms is such an
arbitrary thing. The price of those plants has declined precipitously
since I wrote that, and it had already gone down a lot since the person
who sold them stole them. How interesting, though, that the court of law
— at least in the United States — in order to assess the damage done to
the state, it had to be valued in monetary terms.
</p>
<p style>
<strong>I really liked the inclusion of the story. It’s interesting for
a researcher of illicit and illegal trade to all of a sudden be dragged
into the concrete legal system, and have it, you know, ask something of
you.</strong>
</p>
<p style>
Sometimes academics are hard on ourselves in that we think we put in all
this work and do all this writing and no one actually reads it. And
that’s not true. People <em>do</em> read your work when you publish it
and you should think about who those people might be. They might be
district attorneys for the state of California. People will use your
work, and you should think from the outset about what the social
implications of that might be. It was a big lesson for me.
</p>
<p style>
<strong>At the end of the book, you write that your experiences in the
cactus and succulent community have left you with hope that meaningful
change is possible “not through the repressions of desire but through
its celebration.” After spending so much time among people that some
might call poachers, what makes you optimistic?</strong>
</p>
<p style>
We have so many examples from other illicit economies where prohibition
doesn’t work. I am concerned by a tendency to move in that direction.
Given that we’re talking about plants — you know, as far as we know,
this conversation could be different in 50 years — but we’re not having
to really think about the welfare issues of, say, illegal trade in
animals. There are pragmatic solutions to these problems. This material
could get out into the world so that people who want these plants can
get it in a way that doesn’t harm wild-growing species.
</p>
<p style>
There’s still a ways to go in working through regulatory conventions to
support those efforts. And importantly, in doing so, supporting the
people who should have the most support, which I would argue are the
communities in places in the world that have lived with these plants the
longest.
</p>
<p style>
I see hopeful promise in this, and I saw a whole lot of love. I really
did. I saw a lot of love between people and plants, and what that can do
for people in moving into developing more careful relations with plants
and other species. I don’t have a large collection of cacti and
succulents, but I do have some, and I have like a cactus right now
that’s in flower. Do you want to see it?
</p>
<p style>
<strong>Yes!</strong>
</p>
<p>
This is where I think it’s fun, to think about what plants can teach us—
</p>
<p style>
<strong>Oh, it’s gorgeous!</strong>
</p>
<p style>
This is a <em>Mammillaria laui</em>. Named for Alfred Lau, who I write
about in one of the chapters of the book — a German who lived in Mexico,
who has a lot of different species named after him. This is
<em>Mammillaria laui,</em> subspecies <em>subducta</em>. It’s got
<a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/aoQUvSJaYosWVBNw8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this
gorgeous crown of pink flowers</a>.
</p>
<p style>
I love having these plants. Specifically, I’ve started a small
collection of plants that are associated with particular people that I
wrote about, or that I thought about. Bringing some of that social
history to our plants, I think, is a really nice thing that people can
do. Learn about where our plants come from and the histories of how they
got to where we are.
</p>
<p style>
That’s kind of what set me off on this whole journey, anyway. I think
there’s a lot of opportunity for thinking thoughtfully about the place
of these plants in the world and how they travel and maybe, hopefully,
that can help move us towards a more ethical kind of relation.
</p>
<p style>
<strong>Are you worried now that once you collect all of the plants that
are connected to your book, you’ll throw your whole collection
out?</strong>
</p>
<p style>
I don’t think I have a strong collector tendency, per se. I
<em>have</em> been accused of being a low-key hoarder before. I’m
excited to think about how I’m going to slowly develop a collection over
time. Yeah, but your reference — the worst thing that can happen to a
collector is completing a collection. Freud wrote about this in the
context of completing his collection of statues and dying days later.
This one collector who I went to see, I thought I was going to see a
giant greenhouse of cacti, but I found a bunch of Mexican chili plants.
Because he’d just tossed [the cacti collection] off, he was done with
it. I don’t see myself going down that road but one never knows.
</p>
<p style>
<strong>For someone reading this interview who might be interested in
collecting, where would you say to start?</strong>
</p>
<p>
We need to get over this idea that cacti and succulent plants are great
house plants because they don’t require any care. It’s not true.
Everyone I know who’s had a succulent has killed it very quickly.
</p>
<p style>
<strong>I killed mine.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, if you just throw a succulent on, like, a north-facing windowsill,
it’s not going to do well, especially if you ignore it.
</p>
<p style>
Also, get over the idea that there are natural people in the world with
a green thumb — I think that is also nonsense. We just need to spend
time learning about what these plants need. One of the ways you can do
that is by paying attention to them.
</p>
<p style>
In terms of obtaining material — you know, so much plant material can
also just be found for free, gifted from friends or colleagues or the
community. A lot of collector clubs, like, say, the
<a href="https://cactusandsucculentsociety.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cactus
and Succulent Society of America</a> here in the U.S., I believe may
even send you free seeds of cacti, and stuff like that.
</p>
<p style>
The thing that I want to start doing is trying to grow cacti from seed.
They’re slow-growing plants but I think it’d be really fun to actually
watch that process unfold. And it’s quite easy to obtain seeds for a lot
of these plants. Just, you know, be careful where you’re buying stuff
from. Reputable nurseries are a good source. But be wary of buying from
unknown people on the internet. That might be where people start to get
into trouble.
</p>
<p style>
<strong>Is there anything I haven’t asked you about that you’d like to
let me know about your book or your experience writing it before I let
you go?</strong>
</p>
<p style>
I’m not too prescriptive at the end of the book about what I think the
answer is. Some people may find that frustrating, like, “Oh, but you
didn’t tell us like what should we do” or “What’s the right response?”
One of the reasons for that was I just wanted to let people develop some
of their own thoughts about this. But also it’s because the work isn’t
done.
</p>
<p style>
I’m developing some work right now dealing with illegal succulent trade
in South Africa with some colleagues, both in South Korea but also in
South Africa. I’m doing a new project on illicit Venus flytrap
harvesting and the carnivorous plant trade. I’m trying to continue the
process of thinking and learning with plants. But the work continues.

Pardons National Thanksgiving Turkeys While Marking 81st Birthday</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Liberty and Bell can spread their wings without fear.</p>
<p>The two Thanksgiving turkeys played their part Monday in an annual
holiday tradition at the White House: a president sparing them from
becoming someone’s dinner.</p>
<p>“I hereby pardon Liberty and Bell. Congratulations, birds,” Biden
said after one of the National Thanksgiving Turkeys was placed on a
table near him.</p>
<p>The event, held on the South Lawn this year instead of the smaller
Rose Garden, marks the unofficial start of the holiday season in
Washington, and Monday was an especially busy opening day.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden, the oldest president in U.S. history, also
celebrated turning 81 on Monday. In the afternoon, his wife, first lady
Jill Biden, was accepting the delivery of an 18.5-foot (5.6-meter)
Fraser fir from Fleetwood, North Carolina, as the official White House
Christmas tree.</p>
<p>Biden joked about his age, saying, “this is the 76th anniversary of
this event. I want you to know I wasn’t there for the first one.” The
Democrat’s age has become an issue as he seeks reelection next year.</p>
<p>Steve Lykken, chairman of the National Turkey Federation and
president of the Jennie-O Turkey Store, told The Associated Press in an
interview last week that the pardons are a “great way to kick off the
holiday season and really, really a fun honor.”</p>
<p>Lykken introduced Liberty and Bell on Sunday at the Willard
Intercontinental, a luxury hotel near the White House. The gobblers
checked into a suite there on Saturday following their red-carpet
arrival in the U.S. capital after a dayslong road trip from Minnesota in
a black Cadillac Escalade.</p>
<p>“They were raised like all of our turkeys, protected, of course, from
weather extremes and predators, free to walk about with constant access
to water and feed,” Lykken said at Sunday’s event as Liberty and Bell
strutted around the Willard’s newly renovated Crystal Room on plastic
sheeting laid over the carpet. Young children in the crowd of onlookers
— many of them employees and guests of the Jennie-O company — yelled
“gobble, gobble” at them.</p>
<p>The male turkeys, both about 20 weeks old and about 42 pounds (19
kilograms), were hatched in July in Willmar, Minnesota — Jennie-O is
headquartered there — as part of the “presidential flock,” Lykken said.
They listened to music and other sounds to prepare them for Monday’s
hoopla at the White House.</p>
<p>“They listened to all kinds of music to get ready for the crowds and
people along the way. I can confirm they are, in fact, Swifties, and
they do enjoy some Prince,” Lykken said, meaning that Liberty and Bell
are fans of Taylor Swift. “I think they’re absolutely ready for prime
time.”</p>
<p>The tradition dates to 1947 when the National Turkey Federation,
which represents turkey farmers and producers, first presented a
National Thanksgiving Turkey to President Harry Truman.</p>
<p>Back then, and even earlier, the gobbler was given for the first
family’s holiday consumption. But by the late 1980s, the tradition had
evolved into an often humorous ceremony in which the birds are pardoned,
given a second chance at life after they are spared from ending up on a
family’s Thanksgiving table.</p>
<p>In 1989, as animal rights activists picketed nearby, President George
H.W. Bush said, “But let me assure you, and this fine tom turkey, that
he will not end up on anyone’s dinner table, not this guy — he’s granted
a presidential pardon as of right now — and allow him to live out his
days on a children’s farm not far from here.”</p>
<p>After Biden pardons his third pair of turkeys on Monday, Liberty and
Bell will be returned to their home state to be cared for by the
University of Minnesota’s College of Food, Agricultural and Natural
Resources Sciences.</p>
<p>“You can imagine the wonderful care they’re going to get from
students and veterinarians and professors, etc., and so they will
hopefully have a chance, maybe, to go see a hockey game or spend time
with Goldy the gopher,” Lykken said, referring to the university’s
mascot.</p>
<p>A little over 200 million turkeys will be eaten on Thanksgiving,
Lykken said.</p>
<p>Biden will eat his Thanksgiving turkey with family on Nantucket, a
Massachusetts island, continuing a long family tradition. On Sunday, he
and the first lady served an early Thanksgiving meal to hundreds of
service members at Norfolk Naval Station in Virginia.</p>

id="reactions-to-death-of-rosalynn-carter-former-first-lady-and-global-humanitarian">Reactions
to Death of Rosalynn Carter, Former First Lady and Global
Humanitarian</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Reactions to the death of Rosalynn Carter, former first lady and
global humanitarian:</p>
<p>President Joe Biden said the Carters “brought grace” to the White
House. “He had this great integrity, still does. And she did too,” Biden
told reporters as he was boarding Air Force One to leave Norfolk,
Virginia on Sunday night.</p>
<p>“God bless them.” Biden said he spoke to the family and was told that
Jimmy Carter was surrounded by his children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>Later the White House released an official joint statement from the
president and first lady Jill Biden saying that Carter inspired the
nation.</p>
<p>“She was a champion for equal rights and opportunities for women and
girls; an advocate for mental health and wellness for every person; and
a supporter of the often unseen and uncompensated caregivers of our
children, aging loved ones, and people with disabilities,” the statement
said.</p>
<p>Former President George W. Bush called Carter a woman of dignity and
strength.</p>
<p>“There was no greater advocate of President Carter, and their
partnership set a wonderful example of loyalty and fidelity. She leaves
behind an important legacy in her work to destigmatize mental health. We
join our fellow citizens in sending our condolences to President Carter
and their family,” Bush said in a statement with former first lady Laura
Bush.</p>
<p>U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia said Carter would be remembered for
her compassionate nature and passion for women’s rights, human rights
and mental health reform. “The State of Georgia and the United States
are better places because of Rosalynn Carter,” Ossoff said in a
statement. “I join all Georgians and Americans in mourning her loss. May
Rosalynn Carter’s memory be a blessing.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris said Rosalynn Carter redefined the role
of first lady and lived a life of service, faith, compassion, and moral
leadership.</p>
<p>“As a humanitarian, a public servant, and a global leader,
Mrs. Carter improved the lives of millions — and inspired countless more
to dedicate their lives to service. Her legacy will be a beacon for
generations to come,” Harris said in a statement.</p>
<hr />
<p>Former President Donald Trump said Carter “earned the admiration and
gratitude” of the nation.</p>
<p>“From her days as a U.S. Navy spouse, to the Georgia Governor’s
Mansion, to her tenure as First Lady of the United States, and her later
work at the Carter Center and volunteering with Habitat for Humanity,
she leaves behind a legacy of extraordinary accomplishment and national
service,” Trump said on Truth Social.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, former first lady Melania Trump said Carter
leaves behind a meaningful legacy.</p>
<p>“We will always remember her servant’s heart and devotion to her
husband, family, and country. May she rest in peace,” Melania Trump said
on X, formerly Twitter.</p>
<hr />
<p>Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Carter was a “saintly and
revered public servant” driven by faith, compassion and kindness.</p>
<p>“On the world stage, First Lady Carter was a pioneer. Her historic,
high-stakes diplomatic mission to Latin America in 1977 ushered in a new
era of engagement in the region.</p>
<p>Two years later, she became the first sitting First Lady to address
the World Health Organization, where she argued that mental health was
an aspect of physical health – and that health is a human right,” Pelosi
said in a statement offering condolences to the Carter family.</p>
<hr />
<p>Bill and Hillary Clinton called Carter a champion of human
dignity.</p>
<p>“Thanks to her mental health advocacy, more people live with better
care and less stigma. Because of her early leadership on childhood
immunization, millions of Americans have grown up healthier. And through
her decades of work at the Carter Center and with Habitat for Humanity,
she spread hope, health, and democracy across the globe,” the former
president and former secretary of state said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>“Rosalynn will be forever remembered as the embodiment of a life
lived with purpose.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens called Carter “the model for the modern
day First Lady” and praised her work promoting mental health awareness.
“She never stopped advocating for mental health or the Equal Rights
Amendment,” Dickens said in a statement.</p>
<p>“The city of Atlanta joins all of Georgia — and mourners around the
world — as we honor the memory of First Lady Rosalynn Carter.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Former first lady Michelle Obama said Rosalynn Carter sometimes
offered advice during their periodic lunches at the White House.</p>
<p>“She reminded me to make the role of First Lady my own, just like she
did. I’ll always remain grateful for her support and her generosity,”
Obama said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Today, Barack and I join the world in celebrating the remarkable
legacy of a First Lady, philanthropist, and advocate who dedicated her
life to lifting up others. Her life is a reminder that no matter who we
are, our legacies are best measured not in awards or accolades, but in
the lives we touch.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Habitat For Humanity, the Georgia-based charity that the Carters
worked for tirelessly, said its members were saddened by the former
first lady’s passing.</p>
<p>“She was a compassionate and committed champion of
#HabitatforHumanity and worked fiercely to help families around the
world,” the nonprofit said on X.</p>
<hr />
<p>Carter’s legacy will be a source of pride for her home state, said
U.S. Rep. Nikema Williams, the chair of the Democratic Party of
Georgia.</p>
<p>“Georgia Democrats join our entire state, nation, and the world in
mourning the loss of former First Lady Rosalynn Carter – an
extraordinary humanitarian, fierce mental health advocate, and beloved
daughter of Georgia,” Williams said.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Carter Center said it was grieving the passing of its
co-founder.</p>
<p>“She was a partner in good deeds with her husband, former U.S.
President Jimmy Carter, as they traversed the globe to strengthen
democracy, resolve conflicts, advance human rights, and eliminate
debilitating diseases after their time in the White House,” the center
said in a statement.</p>
<p>In lieu of flowers, Carter requested that those wishing to honor her
memory do so through contributions to the Carter Center’s Mental Health
Program or the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregivers, the statement
said.</p>

President in Hawaii, Boosts US-Philippines Ties, Recalls Family
History</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is meeting with senior
U.S. military leaders and members of Hawaii’s large Filipino community
this weekend in a visit steeped in geopolitical and personal
significance for the leader, but also drawing small protests from a
younger generation of Filipinos who point to the actions of his dictator
father who died in exile in Hawaii.</p>
<p>Marcos, who stopped in Hawaii on his way home from the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco, connected Saturday evening
with members of Hawaii’s large Filipino-American community before a
planned Sunday meeting with Adm. John Aquilino, the top U.S. military
commander in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Marcos is then due to deliver a talk about his nation’s security
challenges and the role of the Philippines-U.S. alliance.</p>
<p>A small number of protesters gathered outside the community meeting
and at the airport where he landed.</p>
<p>Marcos’ trip comes at a time when the U.S. and the Philippines have
been deepening their long-standing alliance in a shift after Marcos’
predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, nurtured cozy ties with China and
Russia.</p>
<p>The Philippines this year agreed to give the U.S. access to four more
bases as America looks to deter China’s increasingly aggressive actions
toward Taiwan and in the South China Sea. In April, the two countries
held their largest military exercises in decades.</p>
<p>But the trip also likely has personal resonance for the leader of the
Philippines. His father, the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, died in
exile in Honolulu after he was ousted in a 1986 army-backed “people
power” uprising.</p>
<p>Many Filipino immigrants in Hawaii also hail from the same part of
the Philippines as Marcos and revere him and his family. Filipinos are
the largest single ethnic group in Hawaii, accounting for 26% of the
state’s population as of the 2020 census.</p>
<p>Winfred Damo, who immigrated to Honolulu from Marcos’ province of
Ilocos Norte in 1999, said being Ilocano means “we always support the
Marcoses.”</p>
<p>The 58-year-old helped campaign for Marcos Jr. in Hawaii and said the
president is a different person than his father and from a different
era. Philippine nationals living abroad can vote in elections back
home.</p>
<p>“We have a better government now in the Philippines,” he said.
“Marcoses are good people. They did a lot in our country, and they are
the best.”</p>
<p>Not all are Marcos fans. Arcy Imasa organized a protest outside the
convention center where Marcos met with community members Saturday. Her
aim was to help younger Filipinos learn his family’s history.</p>
<p>Marcos’ father placed the Philippines under martial rule in 1972, a
year before his term was to expire. He also padlocked Congress, ordered
the arrest of political rivals and left-wing activists and ruled by
decree.</p>
<p>A Hawaii court found the senior Marcos liable for human rights
violations and awarded $2 billion from his estate to compensate more
than 9,000 Filipinos who filed a lawsuit against him for torture,
incarceration, extrajudicial killings and disappearances.</p>
<p>Imasa, 40, who is part of Hawaii Filipinos for Truth, Justice and
Democracy and grew up in the Ilocos province of Pangasinan, said the
mindset of many Filipinos in Hawaii is fixed, especially those of older
generations.</p>
<p>“They’re not on the right side of history. They’re not fully aware of
the crimes that transpired,” she said.</p>
<p>Satu Limaye, the vice president of the East-West Center, noted the
U.S. and the Philippines have a long, complicated relationship. He
pointed to years when the U.S. ruled the archipelago as a colony, when
the two nations signed a mutual defense treaty in 1951 and when the U.S.
military withdrew from major bases in the country in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Duterte was often critical of the U.S., at times questioning the
value of the alliance and demanding more military aid to preserve the
pact. Under Marcos there has been a “180-degree turn” and a massive
change in cooperation and coordination with the U.S., Limaye said.</p>
<p>China has laid sweeping territorial claims over virtually the entire
South China Sea, areas also claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam,
Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan.</p>
<p>China has clashed with its smaller neighbors and subsequently drawn
in the U.S., which is Manila’s treaty ally and China’s main rival in the
Asia-Pacific region. Washington and its allies have deployed navy ships
and fighter aircraft to promote freedom of navigation and overflight, to
build up deterrence and reassure allies.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, dozens of Chinese coast guard and accompanying
ships chased and encircled Philippine vessels during a four-hour
faceoff.</p>
<p>Marcos in September said his country does not want a confrontation
but will defend its waters after its coast guard dismantled a floating
barrier placed by China at a disputed shoal.</p>
<p>Limaye said it’s important to watch how the U.S. and the Philippines
manage their nations’ long and complex relationship while facing their
common concern, China.</p>

Start Thanksgiving Early, Serving Dinner to Service Members</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Joe Biden visited naval installations in Virginia Sunday to
kick off the Thanksgiving holiday week, introducing an early screening
of the upcoming movie “Wonka” and sharing a “Friendsgiving” meal with
service members and their relatives.</p>
<p>The president and first lady Jill Biden headed to Naval Support
Activity Hampton Roads to introduce the new film which centers around
the early life of Roald Dahl’s fictional eccentric chocolatier, Willy
Wonka. The film will be officially released Dec. 15.</p>
<p>He joked to the many youngsters in the crowd: “I like kids more than
adults” and added “I wish I could stay and watch Wonka with you.”</p>
<p>Instead, the Bidens helped serve dinner with service members from the
USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and the USS Gerald R. Ford at Norfolk Naval
Station, the largest installation of its kind in the world, along with
their families. Before departing for dinner, Biden told families during
his speech that the military are the “literal backbone of this country,”
adding, “1% of you, only one” defend “99% of us.”</p>
<p>The event featured hundreds of attendees seated in folding chairs and
around wooden, circular tables inside a concrete-floored hanger that
included a display of a Blackhawk helicopter, a towering American flag
and screen with the image of the White House surrounded by falling
leaves and the words “Happy Thanksgiving.”</p>
<p>“I mean from the bottom of my heart,” the president said. “Family
members, you are the heart of this operation.”</p>
<p>For dinner, Biden served up mash potatoes while attendees lined up
for the buffet-style meal. Jill Biden spooned out sweet potato casserole
to attendees. The menu also featured slow-roasted bourbon brined turkey
topped with giblet gravy and cranberry-orange compote, maple-mustard
glazed spiral-cut smoked ham, brioche-cornbread stuffing, candied
walnuts, roasted garlic and creme fraiche, and a toasted espresso
mascarpone with Chantilly cream.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Biden’s 2024 Republican rival Donald Trump was scheduled
for a military visit Sunday in Texas. The former president, who has a
commanding early lead in the 2024 Republican primary, was in Edinburg
after serving meals to National Guard soldiers, troopers and others who
will be stationed at the U.S.-Mexico border over Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Trump is promoting hard-line immigration proposals he argues will
better secure the border. He and top Republicans have long criticized
the Biden administration for failing to do more to crackdown on people
entering the United States illegally.</p>
<p>For the Bidens, offering support to the nation’s military has a
personal connection. Their son Beau served in Iraq as a member of the
Delaware National Guard. He died of brain cancer in 2015 at the age of
46, when Joe Biden was vice president.</p>
<p>Jill Biden talked about Beau’s deployment at the Wonka event, telling
the crowd: “I know there are many here who miss their mom or dad or
spouse.”</p>
<p>“While nothing can make up for that empty chair at the table, for us,
the kindness of our community and finding moments of joy helps make it a
little bit easier,” she said.</p>
<p>As he prepared to celebrate with the troops at home, the war between
Israel and Hamas and the fate of hostages, including Americans, being
held by the militants in Gaza, were front and center for the president.
A reporter asked Biden upon his arrival in Norfolk when more hostages
might go free, to which he replied, “I’m not in a position to tell you
that.”</p>
<p>The Bidens learned of former first lady Rosalynn Carter’s death
during their visit, announcing her passing just before serving the
Friendsgiving meal. Jill Biden asked diners to “include the Carter
family in your prayers” during the holiday season. Carter, she said,
“was well known for her efforts on mental health and caregiving and
women’s rights.”</p>
<p>The president didn’t mention Carter. He did talk about watching Beau
Biden’s children while he was deployed, but then appeared too overcome
with emotion to continue and said, “I don’t want to talk about this.”
The sadness was fleeting. A moment later he lightheartedly bent down and
joked with a 6-year-old, saying “What are you, 17?”</p>
<p>“Happy, happy, Thanksgiving,” Biden said. “May God love you all.”</p>
<p>Friendsgiving with the military has become a tradition for the
Bidens. Last year, they dished out mashed potatoes and other sides as
part of the buffet-style meal in Cherry Point, North Carolina, home to
more than 9,000 military personnel and roughly 8,000 military family
members.</p>
<p>In 2021, the Bidens visited the U.S. Army’s Fort Bragg in North
Carolina for an early Thanksgiving meal in a hangar for about 250
service members and their families. Troops got chocolate chip cookies
bearing the presidential seal.</p>
<p>The president and first lady plan to spend this Thanksgiving on
Nantucket, a Massachusetts island.</p>

Moments From Former First Lady Rosalynn Carter’s 96 Years</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Landmarks and notable events in the life of former U.S. first lady
Rosalynn Carter:</p>
<p>— Aug. 18, 1927: Eleanor Rosalynn Smith is born at her family home in
Plains, Georgia. She is the daughter of Wilburn Edgar Smith, a mechanic,
and Allie Murray Smith, a seamstress and postal worker.</p>
<p>— Late August 1927: “Miss Lillian” Carter, a neighbor and nurse who
delivered Rosalynn, brings her son, Jimmy, nearly 3 years old, to meet
the new baby.</p>
<p>— 1940: Rosalynn’s father dies, leaving her to help her mother raise
her younger siblings.</p>
<p>— 1945: She begins dating Jimmy Carter, now a Naval Academy
midshipman and the brother of her close friend, Ruth Carter.</p>
<p>— Spring 1946: She graduates from Georgia Southwestern College.</p>
<p>— July 7, 1946: She marries Jimmy at Plains Methodist Church, her
childhood congregation. They would have four children: John William
(“Jack”), born 1947; James Earl III (“Chip”), 1950; Donnel Jeffrey,
1952; and Amy Lynn, 1967.</p>
<p>— 1946-1953: Rosalynn manages the Carter household while Jimmy serves
in the Navy’s nuclear submarine program, attaining the rank of
lieutenant commander.</p>
<p>— 1955: She begins helping Jimmy in the farm warehouse; she soon
“knew more on paper about the business than he did,” she recalled ahead
of their 75th anniversary.</p>
<p>— 1962: She helps Jimmy campaign for state Senate, an office he would
win in a contested election that was ultimately settled in court.</p>
<p>— 1966: Rosalynn begins campaigning on her own for the first-time
during Jimmy’s first run for Georgia governor, a race he loses. But
their model of campaigning separately would be key to winning four years
later and to capturing the presidency in 1976.</p>
<p>— 1975-76: She leads the “Peanut Brigade” of Carter family, friends
and supporters from Georgia who spread out across Iowa and other key
nominating states to widen the campaign’s person-to-person reach. The
same model they used in Georgia revolutionizes presidential campaigning,
with Rosalynn as Jimmy’s top surrogate.</p>
<p>— Jan. 20, 1977: Rosalynn, the newly sworn-in 39th president and
their family draw special attention on Inauguration Day by walking down
Pennsylvania Avenue rather than riding in an armored limousine. The
Carters enroll their daughter Amy in a Washington, D.C., public school
that is majority-Black. In Atlanta, when Carter was governor, Amy
attended private school.</p>
<p>— Summer 1977: Rosalynn makes a 13-day diplomatic trip to seven Latin
American nations and Caribbean islands. She also urges Jimmy to delay
action on treaties yielding control of the Panama Canal, arguing it is
too politically costly for a first term. He proceeds with the
treaties.</p>
<p>— September 1978: Rosalynn is with Jimmy at Camp David for much of
the intense negotiations with Israel’s Menachem Begin and Egypt’s Anwar
Sadat. She listens to and advises the president daily before the three
leaders reach the Camp David Accords. Begin and Sadat both warm to the
first lady, and Sadat becomes especially close to the Carters.</p>
<p>— November 1979: Rosalynn leads a delegation to Cambodian refugee
camps, bringing international media attention to the humanitarian
crisis. She convinces the president to admit more refugees to the
U.S.</p>
<p>— Summer and fall 1980: She campaigns nearly daily on Jimmy’s behalf,
while he stays at the White House working to win the release of American
hostages in Iran.</p>
<p>— 1980: She helps win congressional approval for the Mental Health
Systems Act, dedicating more federal money to local centers for treating
mental health; Republican Ronald Reagan would later reverse course as
president.</p>
<p>— November 1980: Jimmy Carter is denied a second term by Reagan, who
wins 51.6 percent of the popular vote to 41.7% for Carter and 6.7% for
independent John Anderson.</p>
<p>— 1982: The Carters co-founded The Carter Center in Atlanta with a
mission of resolving conflicts, protecting human rights, advocating
democracy and preventing disease around the world.</p>
<p>— 1984: Rosalynn releases her memoir, “First Lady from Plains,” in
which she admits to missing Washington. It is the first of her five
books.</p>
<p>— September 1984: She travels to New York City, where the Carters
volunteer building homes for Habitat for Humanity; this would become
their annual Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Work Project.</p>
<p>— 1987: She establishes the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregivers,
located at her collegiate alma mater, to advocate for Americans who are
unpaid caregivers.</p>
<p>— Summer 1989: Rosalynn travels with Jimmy on a weeklong Africa tour
that includes an international conference on Guinea worm eradication,
perhaps The Carter Center’s most ambitious public health initiative.</p>
<p>— 1996: She establishes the Rosalynn Carter Fellowships for Mental
Health Journalism, based at The Carter Center, to help working
journalists produce better reporting on the topic.</p>
<p>— 1999: She is awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President
Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>— July 10, 2007: She testifies before a U.S. House subcommittee,
urging Congress to require that health insurance policies cover mental
health treatment on par with treatment for other illness.</p>
<p>— November 2016: She hosts the Rosalynn Carter Symposium on Mental
Health Policy for the 32nd time.</p>
<p>— October 2019: In Nashville, the Carters participate in person for
the last time in their Habitat for Humanity work project; the program
would continue.</p>
<p>— April 30, 2021: The Carters receive President Joe Biden and first
lady Jill Biden at their home in Plains. The couples were friends since
the 1976 campaign, when Biden, then a young lawmaker from Delaware,
became the first U.S. senator to endorse Carter for president.</p>
<p>— July 7, 2021: The Carters celebrate their 75th wedding anniversary.
Offering advice for a successful marriage, she says, “each (person)
should have some space. That’s really important.”</p>
<p>— Feb. 18, 2023: The Carter family announces that Jimmy is entering
home hospice care. They would later say they thought he would live only
days but rebounded to celebrate their 77th wedding anniversary and his
99th birthday later in the year.</p>
<p>— May 30, 2023: The family announces that Rosalynn has dementia.</p>
<p>— Sept. 23, 2023: The Carters make a surprise appearance in the
Plains Peanut Festival parade, riding in a Secret Service vehicle with
the windows down for what would be her last public appearance.</p>
<p>— Nov. 17, 2023: The Carter family announces that she has entered
home hospice care.</p>
<p>— Nov. 19, 2023. Rosalynn Carter dies at home in Plains, Georgia, in
the same house where the Carters lived when Jimmy was elected to the
state Senate in 1962.</p>

<h2 id="on-ad-blockers">On Ad Blockers</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-19, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
Every time I stumble on a discussion about blocking ads on the web I ask
myself if there even is a compelling argument against it. I block ads on
the web. Safari is set to prevent cross-site tracking and to hide my IP,
I have
<a href="https://1blocker.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">1Blocker</a>
running on both my Mac and my iPhone and I also have
<a href="https://nextdns.io" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">NextDNS</a>
enabled. If I can prevent ads and tracking from showing up on my device,
I’m gonna do it. Why? Because ads provide literally no value to my life.
</p>
<p>
But that’s the easy part. Things become a lot more complex when you
start dealing with all the other factors that are attached to the ads
world. For example, you can find this kind of argument:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
People who don’t pay and block ads are scamming YouTube, or scamming
advertisers.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Or even this kind of argument:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
And more importantly, they are scamming the content creators. They are
not usually a massive company, but working alone, with YouTube revenue
as their main income.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Am I scamming YouTube because I block their awful ads? Would I be
scamming YouTube if I muted the video and looked at something else while
ads were playing? What’s the scam here? Who is getting scammed?
</p>
<p>
One might even argue that I’m doing YouTube a favor and saving them
bandwidth by not allowing pointless ads to be served to me. Also,
scamming the content creators? If I pay for YouTube Premium I’d still be
served in video ads by the creators themselves. Should I be complaining?
Am I getting scammed then? I’m paying for no ads after all.
</p>
<p>
No matter the case, ads on the web will always be tricky and live in
this bizarre gray area. And until someone comes up with a really
compelling argument for allowing ads I’ll keep running ad-blockers
because I just can’t stand ads.

First Lady Rosalynn Carter, Mental Health Advocate, Dies at 96</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Former first lady Rosalynn Carter, champion of mental health, died at
the age of 96 on Sunday at her home in Plains, Georgia, the Carter
Center said in a statement.</p>
<p>Former President Jimmy Carter, 99, and Rosalynn Carter were married
for 77 years.</p>
<p>Rosalynn Carter is survived by her children, Jack, Chip, Jeff and
Amy; 11 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.</p>
<p>“Rosalynn was my equal partner in everything I ever accomplished,”
former President Jimmy Carter said in the statement released by the
Carter Center. “She gave me wise guidance and encouragement when I
needed it. As long as Rosalynn was in the world, I always knew somebody
loved and supported me.”</p>
<p>The former first lady acknowledged in an interview with VOA in 2014
that the secret to her long marriage to Jimmy Carter was “space” and
“respect.” </p>
<p>“We grew to respect each other,” she told VOA. “I respected what he
could do, and he would respect what I could do, and from then on it’s
been a really wonderful partnership.”</p>
<p>Eleanor Rosalynn Smith Carter was born in Plains, Georgia, on August
18, 1927, and lived in the small peanut farming town during the Great
Depression. </p>
<p>“I had a really wonderful childhood until I was 13 and my daddy died,
and that was sad. We were poor but everybody else was … we didn’t even
know we were poor because we had food in the garden and a cow in the
backyard for milk, and Mother made all my clothes,” Carter recalled in
her interview with VOA. </p>
<p>She grew up familiar with the son of a local peanut farmer, James
Earl Carter Jr. … better known as Jimmy. </p>
<p>“When he was 16, for instance, a senior in high school … I was 13 —
his little sister’s friend. I never ever dreamed I’d go with him,”
Rosalynn Carter explained.</p>
<p>But on a visit back to Plains in 1946 while attending the Naval
Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, Jimmy Carter proposed.  </p>
<p>“When I asked Rosalynn to marry me the first time, she said, ‘No,’”
Jimmy Carter remembered during a 2019 Habitat for Humanity news
conference in Nashville, Tennessee. “And that was in February, and it
wasn’t until May that she changed her mind and decided to get married,”
which they did, in their hometown of Plains, on July 7, 1946.</p>
<p>Rosalynn Carter followed her husband during his naval career and gave
birth to three sons — John “Jack” Carter, James Earl Carter III or
“Chip,” and Jeff. Their daughter Amy was born later in 1967. </p>
<p>When the family returned to Plains in 1953 to take over the Carter
peanut farming business, Rosalynn Carter managed the operations even
after her husband decided to enter politics in 1962.  “He got up one
morning and instead of putting on his khakis to go to work at the
farming supply business, he put on his Sunday pants, and I said where
are you going, and he said he was going to run for the state Senate,”
she told VOA.</p>
<p>After contesting the results of that election, Carter won, launching
his political career that eventually carried them into Georgia’s
governor’s mansion in 1970, and the White House in 1977. While
campaigning to help get her husband elected, Rosalynn Carter heard a
similar concern from voters. </p>
<p>“Every single day I campaigned I had somebody ask me what I would do
for a mentally ill loved one,” she recalled.  As first lady of the
United States, Carter used her platform to advocate for mental health,
forming a presidential commission to address the issue among other
actions that influenced broader public awareness. She traveled the world
the rest of her life working to remove the stigma associated with those
suffering from mental illness.  She believed that “everybody in our
country can realize that it’s just an illness like any other
illness.” </p>
<p>During their time in the White House, President Carter encouraged his
wife’s prominent role in his administration, and sought her counsel
throughout his tenure, including during the Camp David Accords, which
ended a state of war between Israel and Egypt. </p>
<p>Rosalynn Carter had fond reflections about the effort. “It was one of
the most thrilling days of my life. … I was standing with Mrs. [Aliza]
Begin, and Prime Minister [Menachem] Begin got to her before Jimmy got
to me, and he came up and said, ‘Momma, we’re going to go down in
history for this.’” </p>
<p>The joy of the Camp David Peace Accords was tempered by the hostage
crisis in Iran, which ultimately contributed to Carter’s presidential
election defeat to Republican Ronald Reagan in 1980.</p>
<p>The couple returned to Plains, Georgia, in 1981 to plan their
post-presidential life, in which Jimmy Carter explained to her one night
— “I have an idea about what we can do with the rest of our lives,” she
explained to VOA. “He said we can have a place kind of like Camp David,
where we can maybe negotiate peace agreements. That was the germ of the
idea for the Carter Center.” </p>
<p>Founded in 1982, the Carter Center today is one of the leading global
nonprofit organizations, working to “wage peace, fight disease, and
build hope” for people around the world. Under Rosalynn and Jimmy
Carter’s leadership, the Carter Center has monitored more than 100
elections, treated millions of people suffering neglected tropical
diseases, and is on the verge of total eradication of Guinea worm. </p>
<p>The Carter Center also gave Rosalynn Carter the means to continue her
work in mental health advocacy globally. “That’s what I wish for, people
to go for help, get help, and lead good lives,” she said.</p>
<p>Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter are the longest married presidential couple
in U.S. history.  </p>
<p>As her husband entered hospice care toward the end of his life, the
Carter family announced the former first lady was suffering from
dementia. She spent her final years alongside Jimmy Carter in Plains,
where they were born and grew up nearly a century before. </p>
<p>The Carter Center announced Friday that the former first lady had
also entered hospice care at their home in Plains.</p>
<p>The schedule of memorial events and funeral ceremonies will be
announced at a later date, the Carter Center statement said.</p>

<h2 id="campaign-building-blocks">Campaign building blocks</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-19, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Campaign building blocks
</h1>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://ttrpg-hangout.social/@enfors" title="@enfors@ttrpg-hangout.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="enfors">@enfors</span></a> recently
wondered about “important aspects of sandboxes that one can iterate over
and add to.”
</p>
<p>
I’m reminded of the term “Gygaxian Building Blocks”. I think I first
heard this phrase from
<a class="account" href="https://rollenspiel.social/@settembrini" title="@settembrini@rollenspiel.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="settembrini">@settembrini</span></a> in
<a href="https://pesa-nexus.de/2020/06/03/episode-1-wir-spielen-add-dmg/">episode
1</a> of <a href="https://pesa-nexus.de/category/zock-bock-radio/">Zock
Bock Radio</a>, a mostly German, sometimes English podcast about
role-playing games. “Gygaxian Building Blocks” are the things one can
add individually to the rules and therefore everybody can participate in
the game as a creator by writing spells, items, monsters, classes, and
so on. These things stand on their own and aren’t usually influenced by
other such blocks. Adding them is easy. Conversely, the core game
without the lists of spells, items, monsters and classes can be
relatively short. It’s a beautiful way of organizing the game.
</p>
<p>
For a sandbox campaign, the things that have that same quality and which
I’d call my “sandbox campaign building blocks” would be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
powerful people: names, titles and retainers including spells and magic
items
</li>
<li>
settlements: names, a small number of interesting buildings such as
defensive structures and temples, the number of people ready to fight in
case of a battle
</li>
<li>
ruins: mostly dungeons, big or small, often just three to five zones
that may or may not map to “rooms” with monsters and treasure
</li>
<li>
magic schools: these are spell collections by legendary magic users that
facilitate writing up spell selections for other magic-users since I can
select the school they’re from and pick an appropriate subset of spells
(this is what my <a href="Spellcasters">Spellcasters</a> project is all
about)
</li>
<li>
secret societies: names, leaders, and then for each settlement figure
out if the secret society has a presence and if so, who the
representative is
</li>
<li>
gods &amp; demons and their temples: names, themes, and then for each
settlement figure out if there is a shrine or temple and if so, who the
head priest is
</li>
<li>
monsters: I usually like to focus on a subset that is intelligent, with
settlements and plans of their own, almost always humanoids
</li>
<li>
legendary items: as a consequence of treasure allocation for the above,
some powerful magic items entered the sandbox and I need them on a
separate list so that there can be rumours and quests pointing players
towards them
</li>
<li>
permanent portals to other planes: names of these realms, powerful
beings that can be reached (for spells, prayers, summonings…),
environmental effects, rumours and pointing players towards them,
preparing for the high level game
</li>
<li>
rough events in the past: names of wars, sides, immortal necromancer
kings &amp; queens, but only insofar as they help flesh out locations
and magic items etc. – there is no need for a timeline and years, as far
as I am concerned (trying to imagine what I would know without schools
and books – practically nothing except for “Germans bad because of the
World War” and that’s it, I guess?)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Anyway, I think those are the things I am concerned about when I start a
new campaign. If you have a blog post with a similar topic, let me know
and I’ll add a link!

Company</em>’s 200 most innovative companies</a> for designing air
filtration systems in a luxury condo building in Dallas.
</p>
<p style>
The group’s
<a href="https://autocamp.com/location/joshua-tree/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">latest
project</a>, AutoCamp Joshua Tree, is just outside its namesake national
park in southern California, about one hour from Palm Springs and two
hours from Los Angeles. The glamping hotspot embodies HKS’s philosophy
by keeping guests cool — literally and figuratively — using design
strategies to manage the desert heat.
</p>
<p style>
I spoke to Michael Strohmer, who leads the firm’s hotel practice, about
how they tried to maximize shade and minimize environmental impact. Our
conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
</p>
<p style>
<strong>What is the general architectural approach for HKS?</strong>
</p>
<p style>
HKS’s approach to hospitality is to start by understanding the <em>place
</em>— where the site is located. Is it urban? A resort? The point is
for the design to be integrated into the environment. Not only is it
important for the nearby community, it’s important for the guests
visiting. Travelers are looking for something authentic that tells the
story of the place. Our job is to convey that through the design.
Integration with the natural environment is key to what we do.
</p>
<p style>
<strong>I’m curious how you applied this approach to AutoCamp in Joshua
Tree?</strong>
</p>
<p style>
The AutoCamp at Joshua Tree was unique for us. We have designed several
five star resorts — Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, Rosewood to name a few —
but Joshua Tree was our first autocamp. (We have since done another in
Zion State Park.) They were going for approachable luxury versus ultra
luxury — they wanted to provide a higher-end experience and amenities at
a lower price point, still with good service. The point was to build a
place for guests to experience a natural environment with a high level
of quality. It’s definitely a trend we’re seeing quite a bit, this
desire to reconnect with nature. <br/>

<strong>Your
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate-house-hunting-mansions-edition" target="_self">Habitable
score</a> shows extremely high for drought, heat, fire, and even
flooding! Were you aware of that when you built here?</strong>
</p>
<p style>
We were definitely aware of the issues of building in a desert
environment. The high desert freezes in wintertime, and while we are
aware of the climate and were considering that from our design approach,
I didn’t know about the flood risk. I guess flash floods can be an issue
for Palm Springs. Still, the AutoCamp location is at a higher elevation.
It’s not far way but a bit of a different climate.
</p>
<p style>
<strong>What decisions did you make to build AutoCamp for this desert
environment?</strong>
</p>
<p style>
When it came to building orientation, that was a big factor we looked
at. The main clubhouse building was the one fixed piece of architecture
at AutoCamp — the guest rooms are a collection of Airstream trailers
that can be moved. We oriented the clubhouse to minimize the solar
impact and allow for natural light to come in, for the breeze winds to
come through and cool off the interior during the summer months.
</p>
<p style>
The number one thing during summer months in the desert is to provide
shade to escape to, so we built it so the sun doesn’t hit the glass
directly so that it doesn’t absorb into the interior space. The glass is
protected with horizontal elements — trellis slats or louvers — to let
light come through but not the [direct] sun.
</p>
<p>
We also worked with a landscape designer that is familiar with the
desert environment, so we planted a lot of native species also to save
on water. The biggest goal is to minimize the site impact. Bringing in
prefab trailers really helped. Non-conventional construction meant we
didn’t have to wipe out land to rebuild. We were trying to have a light
touch.
</p>
<p style>
<strong>How did you adapt the design for different desert
seasons?</strong>
</p>
<p style>
By providing large operable expanses of glass that allow the clubhouse
to open up during more temperate months. We built in the ability to
bring in natural air and breezes [instead of] always having to use the
AC.
</p>

<strong>What are your three top takeaways for people living in a desert
environment?</strong>
</p>
<p style>
<ol type="1">
<li>Mobility is a great option. I love the idea of a moveable trailer to
take to different environments. The light touch minimizes disruption to
the site.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p style>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Providing shade not just for people but for the buildings is key.
Come up with creative ways to minimize solar impact. Landscaping goes a
long way.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p style>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The main AutoCamp building is in a barrel arched shape based on a
Quonset huts, industrial buildings used by the military that can be
erected quickly in a time of need. They require minimal construction and
the panels are preformed with structural integrity. It’s a playful spin
off of something meant for industrial use and ties into the whole
approachable luxury concept. It doesn’t feel so precious.</li>

Rules Against Tribes in Fight Over Nevada Lithium Mine</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A federal judge in Nevada has dealt another legal setback to Native
American tribes trying to halt construction of one of the biggest
lithium mines in the world.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Miranda Du granted the government’s motion to
dismiss their claims the mine is being built illegally near the sacred
site of an 1865 massacre along the Nevada-Oregon line.</p>
<p>But she said in last week’s order the three tribes suing the Bureau
of Land Management deserve another chance to amend their complaint to
try to prove the agency failed to adequately consult with them as
required by the National Historic Preservation Act.</p>
<p>“Given that the court has now twice agreed with federal defendants
(and) plaintiffs did not vary their argument … the court is skeptical
that plaintiffs could successfully amend it. But skeptical does not mean
futile,” Du wrote Nov. 9.</p>
<p>She also noted part of their case is still pending on appeal at the
9th U.S Circuit Court of Appeals, which indicated last month it likely
will hear oral arguments in February as construction continues at
Lithium Nevada’s mine at Thacker Pass about 370 kilometers northeast of
Reno.</p>
<p>Du said in an earlier ruling the tribes had failed to prove the
project site is where more than two dozen of their ancestors were killed
by the U.S. Cavalry Sept. 12, 1865.</p>
<p>Her new ruling is the latest in a series that have turned back legal
challenges to the mine on a variety of fronts, including
environmentalists’ claims it would violate the 1872 Mining Law and
destroy key habitat for sage grouse, cutthroat trout and pronghorn
antelope.</p>
<p>All have argued the bureau violated numerous laws in a rush to
approve the mine to help meet sky-rocketing demand for lithium used in
the manufacture of batteries for electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Lithium Nevada officials said the $2.3 billion project remains on
schedule to begin production in late 2026. They say it’s essential to
carrying out President Joe Biden’s clean energy agenda aimed at
combating climate change by reducing dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
<p>“We’ve dedicated more than a decade to community engagement and hard
work in order to get this project right, and the courts have again
validated the efforts by Lithium Americas and the administrative
agencies,” company spokesperson Tim Crowley said in an email to The
Associated Press.</p>
<p>Du agreed with the government’s argument that the consultation is
ongoing and therefore not ripe for legal challenge.</p>
<p>The tribes argued it had to be completed before construction
began.</p>
<p>“If agencies are left to define when consultation is ongoing and when
consultation is finished … then agencies will hold consultation open
forever — even as construction destroys the very objects of consultation
— so that agencies can never be sued,” the tribal lawyers wrote in
recent briefs filed with the 9th Circuit.</p>
<p>Will Falk, representing the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony and Summit Lake
Paiute Tribe, said they’re still considering whether to amend the
complaint by the Dec. 9 deadline Du set, or focus on the appeal.</p>
<p>“Despite this project being billed as `green,’ it perpetrates the
same harm to Native peoples that mines always have,” Falk told AP.
“While climate change is a very real, existential threat, if government
agencies are allowed to rush through permitting processes to fast-track
destructing mining projects like the one at Thacker Pass, more of the
natural world and more Native American culture will be destroyed.”</p>
<p>The Paiutes call Thacker Pass “Pee hee mu’huh,” which means “rotten
moon.” They describe in oral histories how Paiute hunters returned home
in 1865 to find the “elders, women, and children” slain and “unburied
and rotting.”</p>
<p>The Oregon-based Burns Paiute Tribe joined the Nevada tribes in the
appeal. They say BLM’s consultation efforts with the tribes “were rife
with withheld information, misrepresentations, and downright lies.”</p>

Drug Decriminalization Law Faces Growing Pushback Amid Fentanyl
Crisis</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Oregon’s first-in-the-nation law that decriminalized the possession
of small amounts of heroin, cocaine and other illicit drugs in favor of
an emphasis on addiction treatment is facing strong headwinds in the
progressive state after an explosion of public drug use fueled by the
proliferation of fentanyl and a surge in deaths from opioids, including
those of children.</p>
<p>“The inability for people to live their day-to-day life without
encountering open-air drug use is so pressing on urban folks’ minds,”
said John Horvick, vice president of polling firm DHM Research. “That
has very much changed people’s perspective about what they think Measure
110 is.”</p>
<p>When the law was approved by 58% of Oregon voters three years ago,
supporters championed Measure 110 as a revolutionary approach that would
transform addiction by minimizing penalties for drug use and investing
instead in recovery.</p>
<p>But even top Democratic lawmakers who backed the law, which will
likely dominate the upcoming legislative session, say they’re now open
to revisiting it after the biggest increase in synthetic opioid deaths
among states that have reported their numbers.</p>
<p>The cycle of addiction and homelessness spurred by fentanyl is most
visible in Portland, where it’s not unusual to see people using it in
broad daylight on busy city streets.</p>
<p>“Everything’s on the table,” said Democratic state Sen. Kate Lieber,
co-chair of a new joint legislative committee created to tackle
addiction. “We have got to do something to make sure that we have safer
streets and that we’re saving lives.”</p>
<p>Measure 110 directed the state’s cannabis tax revenue toward drug
addiction treatment services while decriminalizing the possession of
so-called “personal use” amounts of illicit drugs. Possession of under a
gram of heroin, for example, is only subject to a ticket and a maximum
fine of $100.</p>
<p>Those caught with small amounts of drugs can have the citation
dismissed by calling a 24-hour hotline to complete an addiction
screening within 45 days, but those who don’t do a screening are not
penalized for failing to pay the fine. In the first year after the law
took effect in February 2021, only 1% of people who received citations
for possession sought help via the hotline, state auditors found.</p>
<p>Critics of the law say this doesn’t create an incentive to seek
treatment.</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers have urged Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek to call a
special session to address the issue before the Legislature reconvenes
in February. They have proposed harsher sanctions for possession and
other drug-related offenses, such as mandatory treatment and easing
restrictions on placing people under the influence on holds in
facilities such as hospitals if they pose a danger to themselves or
others.</p>
<p>“Treatment should be a requirement, not a suggestion,” a group of
Republican state representatives said in a letter to Kotek.</p>
<p>Law enforcement officials who have testified before the new
legislative committee on addiction have proposed reestablishing drug
possession as a class A misdemeanor, which is punishable by up to a year
in jail or a $6,250 fine.</p>
<p>“We don’t believe a return to incarceration is the answer, but
restoring a (class A) misdemeanor for possession with diversion
opportunities is critically important,” Jason Edmiston, chief of police
in the small, rural city of Hermiston in northeast Oregon, told the
committee.</p>
<p>However, data shows decades of criminalizing possession hasn’t
deterred people from using drugs. In 2022, nearly 25 million Americans,
roughly 8% of the population, reported using illicit drugs other than
marijuana in the previous year, according to the annual National Survey
on Drug Use and Health.</p>
<p>Some lawmakers have suggested focusing on criminalizing public drug
use rather than possession. Alex Kreit, assistant professor of law at
Northern Kentucky University and director of its Center on Addiction Law
and Policy, said such an approach could help curb visible drug use on
city streets but wouldn’t address what’s largely seen as the root cause:
homelessness.</p>
<p>“There are states that don’t have decriminalization that have these
same difficult problems with public health and public order and just
quality-of-life issues related to large-scale homeless populations in
downtown areas,” he said, mentioning California as an example.</p>
<p>Backers of Oregon’s approach say decriminalization isn’t necessarily
to blame, as many other states with stricter drug laws have also
reported increases in fentanyl deaths.</p>
<p>But estimates from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention show, among the states reporting data, Oregon had the highest
increase in synthetic opioid overdose fatalities when comparing 2019 and
the 12-month period ending June 30, a 13-fold surge from 84 deaths to
more than 1,100.</p>
<p>Among the next highest was neighboring Washington state, which saw
its estimated synthetic opioid overdose deaths increase seven-fold when
comparing those same time periods, CDC data shows.</p>
<p>Nationally, overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids such as
fentanyl roughly doubled over that time span. Roughly two-thirds of all
deadly overdoses in the U.S. in the 12 months ending June 30 involved
synthetic opioids, federal data shows.</p>
<p>Supporters of Oregon’s law say it was confronted by a perfect storm
of broader forces, including the COVID-19 pandemic, a mental health
workforce shortage and the fentanyl crisis, which didn’t reach fever
pitch until after the law took effect in early 2021.</p>
<p>A group of Oregon lawmakers recently traveled to Portugal, which
decriminalized the personal possession of drugs in 2001, to learn more
about its policy. State Rep. Lily Morgan, the only Republican legislator
on the trip, said Portugal’s approach was interesting but couldn’t
necessarily be applied to Oregon.</p>
<p>“The biggest glaring difference is they’re still not dealing with
fentanyl and meth,” she said, noting the country also has universal
health care.</p>
<p>Despite public perception, the law has made some progress by
directing $265 million dollars of cannabis tax revenue toward standing
up the state’s new addiction treatment infrastructure.</p>
<p>The law also created what are known as Behavioral Health Resource
Networks in every county, which provide care regardless of the ability
to pay. The networks have ensured about 7,000 people entered treatment
from January to March of this year, doubling from nearly 3,500 people
from July through September 2022, state data shows.</p>
<p>The law’s funding also has been key for providers of mental health
and addiction services because it has “created a sustainable,
predictable funding home for services that never had that before,” said
Heather Jefferis, executive director of Oregon Council for Behavioral
Health, which represents such providers.</p>
<p>Horvick, the pollster, said public support for expanding treatment
remains high despite pushback against the law.</p>
<p>“It would be a mistake to overturn 110 right now because I think that
would make us go backwards,” Lieber, the Democratic state senator, said.
“Just repealing it will not solve our problem. Even if we didn’t have
110, we would still be having significant issues.”</p>

9.2 for x86 installation guide for VirtualBox</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>OpenVMS on x86 is now available for hobbyists! Almost a year after
the official release. This is a part 1 of my getting started guide,
showing you how to install OpenVMS on VirtualBox on Windows 10/11. More
parts will follow, documenting license installation, network setup, ssh,
application installation etc. If you want to give OpenVMS for x86 a try,
this is the series of articles to read and follow along with. Excellent
work by Remy van Elst.</p>
