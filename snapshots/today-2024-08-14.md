If you don't buy the <a href="https://this.how/newRulesForJournalists/">new rules for journalism</a> because the liars will tell lies about you, the journalist -- well, you get that either way, no matter what you do, so I don't see the problem. And if you want people to trust you, you've got to tell the truth. Your reputation gets destroyed by their lies if you pass them through. Doctors <s>can</s> must tell you to stop smoking to save your life and the tobacco companies will accuse them of lying or whatever and some people (such as myself, earlier in life) will continue to smoke. You still have to do what's right if you want people to trust you.

## Starbucks bets on a darling of the fast food world

date: 2024-08-14, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Starbucks has hired Brian Niccol to become its new CEO following a slump in the company&#8217;s sales in Q3. Niccol took over Chipotle in 2018, and Chipotle&#8217;s stock price has shot up 700% under his tenure. Before that, Niccol led a brand revamp at Taco Bell. We&#8217;ll hear more. Then, consumer inflation is easing toward the Federal Reserve&#8217;s target, and Montreal makes a bet on nightlife by permitting all-night drinking.</p>

## Harris makes me proud

date: 2024-08-14, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I am so impressed with how well the new Democratic Party is running this campaign. Latest innovation, they're going to do at least one public rally during the convention, so everyone can be part of the celebration, and I plan to watch every minute of it. What I don't want to witness is what the journalists try to provoke. I've been to two DNCs and later heard what they were talking about on CNN, and my god they invented crises that simply didn't exist. Who's going to have time to call them out because no one at the convention is watching TV. </p>
<p>I heard on a podcast yesterday that it's weird that Harris is polling as well as the <a href="https://www.advisorperspectives.com/commentaries/2021/11/23/the-generic-ballot-what-to-know-why-its-so-important">generic</a> Democrat, which they felt was odd because she's not a white man, which made me think that in 2024, she is the face of the Democratic Party. Obama and Hillary Clinton knocked down those barriers, and now it would feel strange if the candidate at the top of the ticket were not interracial and female.</p>
<p>I'm proud that my country has nominated such an attractive group of talented people with such fierce competence and humility. For these moments I wish I had a new graphic to put in the margin to symbolize the United States. We're strong, and we win, and when we don't we get back up and fight. Uncle Sam is a great symbol. But we've yet to create the interracial and female version that symbol. </p>
<p>One more thing, there are a lot of white male voters to be courted and welcomed back into the fold. Trump has had the advantage there, but it doesn't have to be that way. A hand reached out in brotherhood could turn this election into the kind of landslide we need to cleanse our political system its flirtation with fascism. </p>

## Judge rejects Trump's latest demand to step aside from hush money criminal case

date: 2024-08-14, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Donald Trump has lost his latest bid for a new judge in his New York hush money criminal case as it heads toward a key ruling and potential sentencing next month. 


In a decision posted Wednesday, Judge Juan M. Merchan declined to step aside and said Trump's demand was a rehash "rife with inaccuracies and unsubstantiated claims" about the political ties of Mercan's daughter and his ability to judge the historic case fairly and impartially. 


It is the third time that the judge has rejected such a request from lawyers for the former president and current Republican nominee. 


All three times, they argued that Merchan, a state court judge in Manhattan, has a conflict of interest because of his daughter's work as a political consultant for prominent Democrats and campaigns. Among them was Vice President Kamala Harris when she ran for president in 2020. She is now her party's 2024 White House nominee. 


A state court ethics panel said last year that Merchan could continue on the case, writing that a relative's independent political activities are not "a reasonable basis to question the judge's impartiality." 


Merchan has repeatedly said he is certain he will continue to base his rulings "on the evidence and the law, without fear or favor, casting aside undue influence." 


"With these fundamental principles in mind, this Court now reiterates for the third time, that which should already be clear — innuendo and mischaracterizations do not a conflict create," Merchan wrote in his three-page ruling. "Recusal is therefore not necessary, much less required." 


But with Harris now Trump's Democratic opponent in this year's White House election, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche wrote in a letter to the judge last month that the defense's concerns have become "even more concrete." 


Prosecutors called the claims "a vexatious and frivolous attempt to relitigate" the issue. 


Messages seeking comment on the ruling were left with Blanche. The Manhattan district attorney's office, which prosecuted the case, declined to comment. 


Trump was convicted in May of falsifying his business records to conceal a 2016 deal to pay off porn actor Stormy Daniels to stay quiet about her alleged 2006 sexual encounter with him. Prosecutors cast the payout as part of a Trump-driven effort to keep voters from hearing salacious stories about him during his first campaign. 


Trump says all the stories were false, the business records were not and the case was a political maneuver meant to damage his current campaign. The prosecutor who brought the charges, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, is a Democrat. 


Trump has pledged to appeal. Legally, that cannot happen before a defendant is sentenced. 


In the meantime, his lawyers took other steps to try to derail the case. Besides the recusal request, they have asked Merchan to overturn the verdict and dismiss the case altogether because of the U.S. Supreme Court's July ruling on presidential immunity. 


That decision reins in prosecutions of ex-presidents for official acts and restricts prosecutors in pointing to official acts as evidence that a president's unofficial actions were illegal. Trump's lawyers argue that in light of the ruling, jurors in the hush money case should not have heard such evidence as former White House staffers describing how the then-president reacted to news coverage of the Daniels deal. 


Earlier this month, Merchan set a September 16 date to rule on the immunity claim, and September 18 for "the imposition of sentence or other proceedings as appropriate." 


The hush money case is one of four criminal prosecutions brought against Trump last year. 


One federal case, accusing Trump of illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, was dismissed last month. The Justice Department is appealing. 


The others — federal and Georgia state cases concerning Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss — are not positioned to go to trial before the November election.

## There are two kinds of advertising

## 2024-08-14 Web applications

date: 2024-08-14, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-14-web-applications">2024-08-14 Web applications</h1>

<p>For my own peace of mind, I have resolved to no longer think of websites as &ldquo;websites&rdquo;. Instead, there are <em>web documents</em> and <em>web applications</em>. I find it easier to accept to use a browser like Firefox like a virtual computer for web applications. Many of the websites these days are in fact web applications.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no point in railing against web applications. I like to write web applications! And I use many of them myself, too.
Things like <a href="Face_Generator">Face Generator</a>, <a href="Text_Mapper">Text Mapper</a> or <a href="Hex_Describe">Hex Describe</a> are impossible to do as documents. In an emergency, you could have a form that then generates a PDF to download, maybe? But is that really preferable? I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<p>And don&rsquo;t get me started on writing native graphical user-interface applications. It takes so much energy to get it right. It gives me a headache. I tried. Take a look at <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/gridmapper-local.git/">Gridmapper with Common Lisp and SDL2</a>, if you want. Compare it with regular <a href="Gridmapper">Gridmapper</a>. Is that really preferable? I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<p>And the reverse is also not cool. I wrote a text user interface tool to generate maps, which can then be downloaded as SVG files. Give <a href="Hex_Populate">Hex Populate</a> a try, it works over SSH. Is that really preferable? I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried Gemtext for a long time. I was very much into <a href="Gemini">Gemini</a>. But these days I no longer think it&rsquo;s the answer. It&rsquo;s like a piece of performance art: the doing of it is a statement. People who step into it are confounded, their beliefs challenged. It&rsquo;s good art! It&rsquo;s interesting technology. But it&rsquo;s not a replacement for <em>web applications</em>. It&rsquo;s not even a good format for <em>web documents</em>! I want inline emphasis – bold, italics, code – and accessible tables with captions and cell navigation, and row-spans, and column-spans. I tried writing code that translated Wikipedia tables into ASCII tables to be used as pre-formatted text in Gemtext. It&rsquo;s hard to do well with the sizing of columns, the line wrapping in cells, the limited space available in a terminal, and when you&rsquo;ve solved all of that, it&rsquo;s still hell for people with bad eye-sight or cognitive problems trying to understand what they&rsquo;re seeing. It&rsquo;s terrible. You could of course do away with all tables. But is that really preferable? I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<p>And so… there&rsquo;s that bifurcation in the road. For this site, for most of the pages that I think of as <em>web documents</em>, I write (or generate) HTML that doesn&rsquo;t require fonts or scripts. If one uses browsers such as eww, links2, w3m, lynx or dillo, it should just work. I wasn&rsquo;t going to convert the corporate web, anyway.</p>

<p>I still serve my site as Gemini and Gopher. But I do it as a political statement, as a piece of performance art.</p>

<p>At the same time, I swallow my pride and <a href="2018-11-14_Firefox_Setup">setup Firefox</a>.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Web">#Web</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Gemini">#Gemini</a></p>

IRA has helped create more than 334,000 new jobs</h3><p>Ahead of the upcoming two-year anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act, the nonprofit Climate Power released a new report analyzing the economic impact of the clean energy investments made possible by the legislation. The topline takeaway: Since August 2022, 646 clean energy projects have been either announced or advanced, creating 334,565 new jobs. Battery manufacturing projects account for the largest share of the new projects, followed by solar projects and EV facilities.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Climate Power</small></p><p>Most of the new projects are located in five states (Michigan, Texas, Georgia, California, and South Carolina) and in congressional districts represented by Republicans in the House of Representatives. These districts alone have seen the creation of 190,727 new jobs and more than $286 billion in clean-energy investment. Projects in low-income communities have brought $114 billion in investment to those areas and created more than 134,000 jobs. The report notes that clean energy jobs tend to pay more, and that most of them do not require a four-year degree, “meaning they’re accessible to all Americans.” Aside from highlighting the “clean energy boom,” the report warns that a second Trump presidency could halt the progress.</p><h3>2. Vineyard Wind can resume ‘limited activites’ at wind farm, but no power generation</h3><p>Just a little update on the situation at the Vineyard Wind 1 site off the coast of Massachusetts, where activity has been paused since July because of <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/vineyard-wind-answers" rel="noopener" target="_self">a broken turbine blade</a>: Following a safety consultation, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement has told Vineyard Wind it <a href="https://nantucket-ma.gov/3259/Week-5-August-12---18" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">can resume some limited activities</a>, like installing turbine towers and nacelles (the container at the top of the tower where the generator, gearbox, and other key components are located). But it cannot install any new turbine blades, or resume power production. Vineyard Wind and the blade’s manufacturer, GE Vernova, this week did some <a href="https://www.vineyardwind.com/press-releases/2024/8/9/incident-response-and-action-plan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“controlled cutting”</a> on the damaged turbine to prevent more debris from falling into the ocean.

By examining data provided by researchers at the University of Maryland, the WRI concluded that the area consumed by fire annually has grown by 5.4% each year since 2001, and “record-setting forest fires are becoming the norm.” In 2023 alone, the amount of land affected by forest fires was 23% larger than the previous record year. Most of the tree cover loss due to fires is happening in the boreal forests, which is worrying because these forests store between 30% and 40% of the world’s terrestrial carbon. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

In 2025, the rate of warming is expected to be about .38 degrees Fahrenheit each decade, but this will fall to an increase of .27 degrees Fahrenheit per decade by 2050. Those estimates are based on current mitigation policies, and the researchers say the rate could slow even more if we curb fossil fuel emissions more aggressively. There are a lot of caveats and moving parts here, and the researchers are upfront about this, noting that factors like El Niño, fluctuations in aerosol emissions, and the fact that “climate damage may show a non-linear response to amounts of climate change” could render their projections inaccurate. Nonetheless, “various analyses suggest that under current mitigation policies we are at or near a time of peak anthropogenic carbon emissions.”</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p><em>“No Republicans voted for the IRA, but they know their constituents are receiving the benefits.”</em> –White House senior climate adviser John Podesta <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/08/13/remarks-as-prepared-for-john-podesta-ira-two-year-anniversary-speech/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">speaking</a> yesterday at an event hosted by think-tank Third Way.</p>

## Ernesto becomes a hurricane after brushing past Puerto Rico

date: 2024-08-14, from: VOA News USA

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Tropical Storm Ernesto has become a hurricane after brushing past Puerto Rico late Tuesday as officials closed schools, opened shelters and moved dozens of the U.S. territory's endangered parrots into hurricane-proof rooms.


Forecasters issued a hurricane watch for the U.S. and British Virgin Islands as well as the tiny Puerto Rican islands of Vieques and Culebra, which are popular with tourists.


The storm moved over the U.S. Virgin Islands on Tuesday night. After passing Puerto Rico, it is expected to move into open waters and be near Bermuda on Friday.




Heavy rains began pelting Puerto Rico, and strong winds churned the ocean into a milky turquoise as people rushed to finish securing homes and businesses.


“I'm hoping it will go away quickly,” said José Rodríguez, 36, as he climbed on the roof of his uncle's wooden shack in the Afro-Caribbean community of Piñones on Puerto Rico's north coast to secure the business famous for its fried street food.


Ernesto was about 60 miles (95 kilometers) east-northeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico late Tuesday night. It had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 kph) and was moving northwest at 17 mph (28 kph).


“We are going to have a lot of rain,” Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said as he urged people to be indoors by early Tuesday evening.


He activated the National Guard as crews across the island visited flood-prone areas and older residents as part of last-minute preparations. Meanwhile, Department of Natural Resources officials who work at breeding centers for the island's only remaining native parrot, the Puerto Rico Amazon, moved them indoors.


Ernesto Rodríguez with the National Weather Service warned that the storm's trajectory could change as it approaches Puerto Rico.


“We should not lower our guard,” he said.


As intermittent rain pelted Puerto Rico's northeast, residents in Piñones tried to squeeze in a couple more hours of work.


María Abreu, 25, prepared fried pastries stuffed with shrimp, crab, chicken and even iguana meat as she waited for customers.


“They always come. They buy them in case the power goes out,” she said.


Down the road, Juan Pizarro, 65, picked nearly 100 coconuts from palm trees swaying in the strong breeze. He had already secured his house.


“I'm ready for anything,” he said.


Forecasters have warned of waves of up to 20 feet (six meters), widespread flooding and possible landslides, with six to eight inches (15-20 centimeters) of rain forecast for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and up to 10 inches (25 centimeters) in isolated areas. Puerto Rico has six reservoirs that already were overflowing before the storm.


Officials in Puerto Rico warned of widespread power outages given the crumbling electric grid, which crews are still repairing after Hurricane Maria razed it in September 2017 as a Category 4 storm.


Juan Saca, president of Luma Energy, a private company that operates the transmission and distribution of power in Puerto Rico, urged people to report blackouts: “Puerto Rico's electrical system is not sufficiently modernized to detect power outages.”


Outages also were a concern in the neighboring U.S. Virgin Islands for similar reasons, with blackouts reported on St. Thomas and St. John on Monday.


“Don't sleep on this,” said U.S. Virgin Islands Gov. Albert Bryan Jr., whose administration announced early Tuesday that it was closing all schools.


The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency echoed those warnings, saying residents in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands “should be prepared for extended power outages.”


Early Tuesday, Ernesto drenched the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, where officials closed several main roads and warned that the quality of potable water would be affected for several days. Meanwhile, the storm downed a couple of trees in Antigua, and knocked out power to most of the island. Ernesto also forced the cancellation of dozens of flights to and from Puerto Rico.


Ernesto is the fifth named storm of this year’s Atlantic hurricane season.


The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-average Atlantic hurricane season this year because of record warm ocean temperatures. It forecast 17 to 25 named storms, with four to seven major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher.

## US Rep. Ilhan Omar, member of progressive ‘Squad,’ wins Democratic primary in Minnesota

date: 2024-08-14, from: VOA News USA

MINNEAPOLIS — Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, one of the progressive House members known as the “Squad” and a sharp critic of how Israel has conducted the war in Gaza, has won her primary race in Minnesota.


Omar successfully defended her Minneapolis-area 5th District seat against a repeat challenge from former Minneapolis City Council member Don Samuels, a more centrist liberal whom she only narrowly defeated in the 2022 primary.


Speaking to supporters in Minneapolis, Omar echoed some of the themes of the Harris-Walz presidential campaign.


“We run the politics of joy," she said. "Because we know it is joyful to fight for your neighbors. ... We know it is joyful to make sure housing is a human right. We know it is joyful to fight for health care to be a human right. We know it is joyful to want to live in a peaceful and equitable world.”


Omar avoided the fate of two fellow Squad members. Rep. Cori Bush lost the Democratic nomination in her Missouri district last week, and Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York lost his primary in June. Both faced well-funded challengers and millions of dollars in spending by the United Democracy Project, a super political action committee affiliated with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which appeared to sit out the Minnesota race.


Samuels had criticized Omar’s condemnation of the Israeli government’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war. While Omar has also criticized Hamas for attacking Israel and taking hostages, Samuels said she’s one-sided and divisive. He also stressed public safety issues in Minneapolis, where a former police officer murdered George Floyd in 2020.


Samuels said he was “very disappointed” with his loss.


“What I was hoping is that a strong ground game and an attention to the details of folks who felt left out would trump an overwhelming superiority in dollars,” he said in an interview. “Clearly money matters a little more in politics than I had hoped."


Omar reported raising about $6.2 million. Samuels raised about $1.4 million.


Omar will face Republican Dalia Al-Aqidi, an Iraqi American journalist and self-described secular Muslim who calls Omar pro-Hamas.


Meanwhile, conservative populist and former NBA player Royce White defeated Navy veteran Joe Fraser in Minnesota’s primary election for the Republican nomination to challenge Democratic U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar in November.


And former federal prosecutor Joe Teirab, supported by former President Donald Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson and the National Republican Congressional Committee, won a contested GOP primary for Minnesota’s 2nd District seat held by Democratic Rep. Angie Craig.


His opponent, defense attorney Tayler Rahm, won the endorsement at the district convention with support from grassroots conservatives.


While Rahm announced in July that he was suspending his campaign and would instead serve as a senior adviser for Trump’s Minnesota campaign, he remained on the ballot.


Teirab will face Craig in what’s expected to be Minnesota’s most competitive House race in November.


“Tonight’s definitive results send a clear message that Republicans are united and ready for change," Teirab said in a statement. "We are ready to support candidates who will strengthen our economy, secure the border, and restore safety in our communities.”


Craig issued a statement calling him “a guy who recently moved to the district because he saw a political opportunity."


“He’s a guy who has spent months doing anything to win the support of Washington Republicans,” Craig said. "And he’s a guy who has made it his life’s mission to take away reproductive freedoms from families and give those decisions to politicians.”


In the U.S. Senate race, White — an ally of imprisoned former Trump aide Steve Bannon and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones — shocked many political observers when he defeated Fraser at the party convention for the GOP endorsement.


White's social media comments have been denounced as misogynistic, homophobic, antisemitic and profane. His legal and financial problems include unpaid child support and questionable campaign spending, including $1,200 spent at a Florida strip club after he lost his primary challenge to Omar in 2022. He argues that, as a Black man, he can broaden the party’s base by appealing to voters of color in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area and others disillusioned with establishment politics.


Following his win, White said in a post on the social platform X: “Bring it on commies… The People Are Coming.”


Democratic leaders denounced him as a far-right extremist.


"While Royce White’s language and policies seek to divide Minnesotans, Senator Amy Klobuchar is focused on bringing people together to get things done, and she is consistently ranked as one of the most bipartisan and effective legislators in the Senate," Ken Martin, the state Democratic Party chair, said in a statement. "The choice this November could not be more clear.”


Fraser said earlier that White’s confrontational style and message won’t attract the moderates and independents needed for a competitive challenge against Klobuchar, who's seeking a fourth term. He said he offered a more mainstream approach, stressing fiscal conservativism, a strong defense, world leadership and small government. Fraser has also highlighted his 26 years in the Navy, where he was an intelligence officer and served a combat tour in Iraq.


Neither had anywhere near the resources that Klobuchar has. White last reported raising $133,000, while Fraser took in $68,000. Klobuchar, meanwhile, has collected about $19 million this cycle and has more than $6 million available to spend on the general election campaign. She faced only nominal primary opposition.


Another clash between establishment and grassroots Republicans played out in western Minnesota's 7th District. Trump-backed GOP Rep. Michelle Fischbach, considered one of the most conservative members of Congress, defeated small businessman Steve Boyd. Boyd ran to her right on a religious platform and blocked her from getting endorsement at the district convention. Boyd reported spending $170,000, while Fischbach spent over $1 million.


Among the legislative primaries on the ballot Tuesday, Democrats picked former state Sen. Ann Johnson Stewart to face Republican Kathleen Fowke in a high-stakes race that will determine not only which party controls the state Senate, but whether Democrats maintain their narrow “trifecta” control of both chambers and the governor’s office. Democrats used that power to pass an ambitious agenda over the last two years that helped put Gov. Tim Walz on the radar of Vice President Kamala Harris before she picked him to be her running mate.


It will be the only state Senate seat in the November ballot. The seat in the western Minneapolis suburbs had been held by Democrat Kelly Morrison, who will face Republican Tad Jude for Minnesota's 3rd Congressional District seat.

## Why Treasury’s No. 2 Official Wants Permitting Reform

date: 2024-08-14, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzE3MTE4OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMjY0MjUyMn0.cOlqi7DMzK-UplZ6w6Gq4XuN2tdcMjVf6L0ObEzl9Do/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Two years ago this week, President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest investment in clean energy and climate mitigation in American history. It contained roughly two dozen new or expanded tax credits that will — if the forecasts bear out — provide hundreds of billions of dollars in funding over the next decade. The administration is now rushing to finalize those provisions before the November election.
</p><p>
	Perhaps no official has been more central to setting up those tax credits than 
	<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/Wally-Adeyemo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Wally Adeyemo</u></a>, the deputy secretary of the U.S. Treasury Department.

Adeyemo has led the agency’s effort to implement the climate law, overseeing a group of tax lawyers and political appointees who are critical to the legislation’s ultimate success. He joins Shift Key this week to help us kick off our second season and talk about how the effort to implement the climate law is going, what could stand in its way, and why he wants some kind of permitting reform.

	Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer:</strong> So obviously, one of the huge risks for investors is that the IRA is repealed, in part or in full, in the next Congress. And we know, just as a fact, that Congress is going to have to do something on taxes. Next Congress, the Trump tax cuts are expiring, there’s going to be, there’s interest in doing something with a child tax credit. It’s going to really come down to who has control of the two chambers.
	<br/>
<br/>
	How are you thinking about, as a Democratic administration, protecting the IRA going into a very ambiguous 2025 environment, and how are companies who you talk to thinking through that quite large political risk around the threat of repeal next year?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Wally Adeyemo: </strong>So maybe I’ll break it down into two different types of tax credits, the business tax credits and the consumer-oriented tax credits. When it comes to business tax credits, as you both know from following this for a while, those don’t usually go away. Because ultimately, what happens is that, for these businesses, they do a fairly good job of making clear to members how those tax credits are tied to jobs that end up being in their districts.
	<br/>
<br/>
	One of the things that I’m proudest of is, when you look at the dispersion of projects tied to the IRA throughout the country, it puts us in a place where a number of people who voted for — and even, in some cases, many who didn’t vote for — the IRA now have significant projects being funded by the IRA happening in their districts, that they’re hiring people based on IRA-related projects, and it’s driving real economic activity. So when it comes to these business tax credits, my sense is that there’s going to be a case for keeping them, independent from the climate goals, which they’re helping to achieve because of the fact that they’re creating jobs in these districts that are helping to power those local economies.
	<br/>
<br/>
	On the consumer tax credits — and just today, I think we’re speaking on August 7, we put out a report about more than 3 million Americans claiming a set of consumer-oriented credits to help install things like solar panels on their homes, and heat pumps. And on these credits — they existed before the IRA. And frankly, what we did with the IRA was, we further incentivized people and created some flexibility within these credits. <br/>
<br/>
These credits existed in the last administration. They’ve existed during the Obama administration. So the reality is that for some of these consumer-oriented credits and some of the business-oriented credits, they had both existed in Republican administrations. There have been Republicans who have supported them. For example, when you think about the wind credits, there have been a number of senators from the Midwest, both Democrats and Republicans, who have been huge advocates for them because they matter to their district. 
	<br/>
<br/>
So from my standpoint, the most important thing we can do to preserve the IRA is to make sure that we get these rules done as quickly as possible, so that not only businesses but individuals start to rely on them. They help, from my standpoint, address the climate crisis that we face. But from the standpoint of consumers, they help lower their cost. And the report we put out today showed that for some consumers installing a heat pump, for example, it lowered the cost of utilities by up to $3,000 a year. The more that happens, the more people who take advantage of it, the more likely that those tax credits are going to remain. And I think that’s also true for the business tax credit. So that’s the strategy, and I think that it’s one that’s been borne out by other business and consumer tax credits in the past.

## US approves $20 billion in weapons sales to Israel amid threat of wider Middle East war

date: 2024-08-14, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. has approved $20 billion in arms sales to Israel, including scores of fighter jets and advanced air-to-air missiles, the State Department announced Tuesday.


Congress was notified of the impending sale, which includes more than 50 F-15 fighter jets, Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles, or AMRAAMs, 120 mm tank ammunition and high explosive mortars and tactical vehicles and comes at a time of intense concern that Israel may become involved in a wider Middle East war.


However, the weapons are not expected to get to Israel anytime soon, they are contracts that will take years to fulfill. Much of what is being sold is to help Israel increase its military capability in the long term, the earliest systems being delivered under the contract aren't expected until the 2026 timeframe.


"The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to U.S. national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability. This proposed sale is consistent with those objectives," the State Department said in a release on the sale.


The Biden administration has had to balance its continued support for Israel with a growing number of calls from lawmakers and the U.S. public to curb military support there due to the high number of civilian deaths in Gaza. It has curbed one delivery of 2,000-pound weapons amid continued airstrikes by Israel in densely populated civilian areas in Gaza.


The contracts will cover not only the sale of 50 new aircraft to be produced by Boeing. It will also include upgrade kits for Israel to modify its existing fleet of two dozen F-15 fighter jets with new engines and radars, among other upgrades. The jets comprise the biggest portion of the $20 billion in sales with the first deliveries expected in 2029.

## Pentagon: Iran-backed attack injured 8 US troops in Syria

date: 2024-08-14, from: VOA News USA

pentagon — Eight U.S. service members in Syria were injured in a drone attack by Iranian-backed militants last week, Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder said on Tuesday. 


Tuesday marked the first time that the Pentagon blamed Iranian proxies for Friday's attack.  


"We assess that it was conducted by Iranian-backed militia, but we're still digging into the specifics," Ryder said in response to a question from VOA at a Pentagon briefing. 


Ryder told reporters the service members had been treated for smoke inhalation and traumatic brain injury. Three of the injured troops have returned to duty, he added.  


Earlier, the U.S. military said several American and coalition personnel had been wounded in a drone attack late Friday at Rumalyn Landing Zone in eastern Syria but stressed that "none of the injuries are life threatening." 


The United States has about 900 troops in Syria and 2,500 in neighboring Iraq to advise and assist local forces working to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State terror group in the region.  


The drone strike in Syria marked the second time this month that U.S. military personnel in the Middle East had been injured in attacks. Five Americans were injured in a rocket attack against al-Asad air base August 5 in Iraq, with three transported to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany for further care, according to deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh.  


Iranian-backed militias have launched dozens of attacks against U.S. forces in the region since Israel began its military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas' deadly October 7 terror attacks.

## Democrats are energized, but can Harris win?

date: 2024-08-14, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Since replacing President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris has quickly consolidated power and energized a campaign that many Democrat leaders had worried about.


Meeting no meaningful challenge from other Democrats, Harris secured votes to be the nominee from 4,567 delegates — 99% of the participating delegates — in a virtual call earlier this month. 


The campaign, together with the Democratic National Committee and other joint fundraising committees, raised a historic $310 million in July, dwarfing the tally for the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump, in the same month. More than $200 million of Harris’ haul came during the first week of her candidacy. 

 

“We’ve seen a groundswell of support. The type of grassroots support -- organizing and fundraising — that wins elections,” said Kevin Munoz, a Harris campaign spokesperson.

 

The campaign’s optimism is reflected in the polls. After another series of very strong surveys in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, Harris now has a 55% chance of winning, said election data analyst Nate Silver.


Silver gave Biden a 27% chance of winning when he was the Democratic nominee.


However, the Trump campaign insists that the fundamentals of the race have not changed.


“The Democrats deposing one Nominee for another does NOT change voters discontent over the economy, inflation, crime, the open border, housing costs not to mention concern over two foreign wars,” Trump campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio said in a memo.


Harris’ “honeymoon” will soon end, he said. “While the public polls may change in the short run and she may consolidate a bit more of the Democrat base, Harris can’t change who she is or what she’s done.”


While the fundamentals have not changed, they were “being obstructed by concern about Biden’s age and cognitive abilities,” said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics.


“Donald Trump is as unpopular as ever, and now he has an opponent who is much more appealing,” he told VOA. “Democrats are back in the game.”


Battleground states


In the United States, elections are not determined by winning the popular vote but by winning Electoral College votes, which are allotted to each state roughly in proportion to its population. In all but two states, the candidate getting the most votes in a state gets all its Electoral College votes.


Harris’ team has been investing heavily in campaign infrastructure, opening offices, recruiting new staff and enlisting tens of thousands of volunteers in what is considered battleground or swing states that could help determine the 2024 electoral victory — Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia. 


In 2020, those seven states were won by a margin of 3 percentage points or less. Currently, Harris is polling slightly ahead but still within the polling margin of error in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Trump is ahead in Michigan, Nevada, Arizona and North Carolina. He is leading by more than the polling error margin in Georgia.


Both Trump and Harris will be hard-pressed to win without Pennsylvania, said Democratic strategist Julie Roginsky. Pennsylvania has 19 Electoral College votes, the most of any swing state.  

 

“They can each afford to lose it but would have to run the table in most, if not all, of the other swing states, which include Arizona, Wisconsin, Georgia, Michigan and North Carolina,” Roginsky told VOA. 


A candidate needs to secure at least 270 out of the 538 electoral college votes to win. Ultimately, it comes down to winning more Electoral College votes than your opponent, however you make that math happen, said Kelly Dittmar, associate professor of political science at Rutgers University-Camden.


“Winning swing states with a high number of Electoral College votes, such as Michigan and Pennsylvania — both states where Democrats have recently won statewide and where Biden won in 2020 — is one solid path toward [Harris] achieving success,” Dittmar told VOA. 

 

In Michigan, a state with a large population of Arab Americans, Harris will need to convince the more than 100,000 people, angry over the Biden administration's staunch support for Israel, who wrote “uncommitted” on their primary ballots. Thirty members of the so-called Uncommitted National Movement have earned delegate spots at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next week.

 

Harris also inherits opposition from the “Abandon Biden” movement over the same cause.

 

“We are saying do not vote for those who are supporting or endorsing what's happening currently in Gaza,” Hudhayfah Ahmad, the campaign’s media representative, told VOA. “Quite frankly, that applies to both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.” 


Inflation and immigration 


While Democrats’ enthusiasm has soared, Harris must deal with voters’ frustration over high inflation, a problem that Republicans blame on the Biden-Harris administration.


Trump previously held a commanding lead among voters on key economic issues, with various polls showing Americans think they will be better off financially under Trump than Biden. 


However, a survey conducted for the Financial Times and the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business published this week found that 41% trust Trump to be better at handling the economy, while 42% believe Harris would be better – a figure up seven points from Biden's numbers in July.


Immigration is another weak spot for Biden, and by extension Harris. The Trump campaign has sought to paint her as the nation’s “Border Czar” responsible for the “invasion” of Central American migrants crossing into the United States from the border with Mexico.


Her campaign is now aiming to present their candidate as someone who is pro-immigration but tough in enforcing the law, by highlighting Harris’ life story as the daughter of immigrants and experience as a former attorney general of California, the state with the largest number and share of immigrants.


“I was attorney general of a border state,” Harris said at a recent rally in Arizona, a swing state where immigration is a top concern for voters. “I went after the transnational gangs, the drug cartels and human traffickers. I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won.”


Will she win in November? 


In such a tight race in an ever-changing political environment, analysts have avoided saying that any candidate’s path to victory is clear.


The Harris campaign said they believe this will be a very close election, decided by a very small number of voters, in just a few states.


Even with this momentum, said Harris campaign spokesperson Munoz, “we are the underdogs in this race, and we’re taking nothing for granted.”

## US Army analyst pleads guilty to selling military secrets to China

date: 2024-08-14, from: VOA News USA

washington — A U.S. Army intelligence analyst on Tuesday pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to sell military secrets to China, the Department of Justice said. 


Korbein Schultz was charged in March with conspiracy to disclose national defense information, exporting defense articles and technical data without a license, and bribery of a public official. 


Schultz, who held top secret clearance, conspired with an individual who lived in Hong Kong — who he suspected of being associated with the Chinese government — to collect national defense information, including classified information and export-controlled technical data related to U.S. military weapons systems, in exchange for money, according to charging and plea documents.  


"Governments like China are aggressively targeting our military personnel and national security information and we will do everything in our power to ensure that information is safeguarded from hostile foreign governments," FBI Executive Assistant Director Robert Wells said in a statement.  


Before he was arrested, Schultz sent dozens of sensitive and restricted, but unclassified, military documents, the Department of Justice said. 


A document discussing the lessons learned by the Army from the Russia-Ukraine war that it would apply in a defense of Taiwan, documents relating to Chinese military tactics, and a document relating to U.S. military satellites were among the items collected and sent by Schultz. 


Schultz was paid about $42,000 for the information, according to the department.  


"By conspiring to transmit national defense information to a person living outside the United States, this defendant callously put our national security at risk to cash in on the trust our military placed in him," Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen said. 


Schultz is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 23, 2025.

## Biden strikes $150M blow against cancer in campaign to slash deaths

date: 2024-08-13, from: VOA News USA

washington  — President Joe Biden on Tuesday visited Louisiana's infamous "Cancer Alley" to strike at what he identified as a top priority of his dwindling presidency: announcing $150 million in research funding toward the goal of dramatically reducing cancer deaths in the United States.


The Cancer Moonshot is an initiative close to Biden's heart. Both he and first lady Jill Biden have had brushes with skin cancers. And in 2015, an aggressive brain cancer took the life of their eldest son, Beau.


"We're moving quickly," Biden said of the initiative, which has a goal of reducing the U.S. cancer death rate by at least half by 2047. "Because we know that all families touched by cancer are in a race against time."


Cancer is the second-biggest cause of death worldwide. The National Cancer Institute predicts that 2 million Americans will be diagnosed this year with the immune-mediated disease, which can manifest in organs, bone marrow and blood and which comes in hundreds of different varieties.


"Cancer touches us all," the first lady said. "When Joe and I lost our son to brain cancer, we decided to turn our pain into purpose. We wanted to help families like ours so that they won't have to experience this terrible loss, and as president, Joe has brought his own relentless optimism to the Biden Cancer Moonshot to end cancer as we know it. It's ambitious, but it's also within our reach – maybe not yet, but one day soon."


Biden launched the initiative when he was vice president. Since he restored the program as president, the research agency he created has invested more than $400 million in the cause.


Cancer advocates praised the move but stressed the need for long-term engagement.


"We've made tremendous strides in how we prevent, detect, treat and survive cancer, but there is still much work to be done to improve the lives of those touched by this disease," said Dr. Karen E. Knudsen, CEO of the American Cancer Society and the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network.


"Cancer cases are estimated to hit an all-time high this year, and we cannot relent in driving forward public policies that will address this," Knudsen said. "Funding more researchers across the country focused on more effective and innovative treatments will bring us closer to future cancer breakthroughs and ending cancer as we know it, for everyone."


And cancer is often compounded by environmental causes – such as those in the 140-kilometer (85-mile) stretch of communities between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, home to a string of major fossil fuel and petrochemical operations.


Karl Minges, associate dean in the School of Health Sciences at the University of New Haven, told VOA that while the disease itself doesn't discriminate, social factors often make it hit harder in lower-income communities.


"Any time that money from the federal government and publicity is put on a topic, I think it's something that has the ability to actually make a significant difference," he told VOA.


And, he said, the fact that this federal money is going toward research institutions – and not private pharmaceutical companies – means the lessons learned can be shared well beyond the United States.


"The U.S. is always on sort of the cutting edge with regard to [research and development] of new drugs and treatments and methodologies," he said.


"But by giving the money to the institutes, it's sort of available as public funding for researchers to access, and anytime that's the case, there's an imperative, whether it's a clinical trial or it's a an observational study, that the results are in the public domain, so that can be then subsumed by other countries outside of the United States who face similar issues," Minges said.

## Rooftop Solar Has a Big — But Surprising — Racial Disparity

date: 2024-08-13, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzE3MDMyOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MjcxOTQ0Nn0.ma5oQ39uIGbh8LucM-x22wv_BQx4m2Mcz1-KU8vj-5U/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Higher-income people are more likely to have solar panels on their roofs. <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/ira-tax-credit-data" target="_blank">This fact</a> has underlined the nature of home solar adoption and is responsible for any number of state, local, and now federal programs to give lower-income people access to solar power, either through subsidizing their own solar panels or letting them “subscribe” to solar power generated elsewhere.
</p><p>
	While this seems like an obviously sensible solution — the upfront cost of solar can be around $15,000 to $20,000, and you typically need to own a single family home to get it — it’s not quite as simple as those with more money are more likely to get solar. When the University of Texas economist Jackson Dorsey and Derek Wolfson looked at data provide by the solar marketplace EnergySage, they found that, yes, those with higher incomes are more likely to buy solar — but also that what solar installers offered them and what they paid for it varied depending on the demographics of the surrounding area.
</p><p>
	“Econ 101, there’s usually two possible reasons why you might have lower quantities in a market. One would be demand is lower, and the other would be supply is lower,” Dorsey told me when I asked what had motivated his research. While the data about high-income demand for energy transition products like solar panels or electric vehicles is plentiful, there had been less attention paid to supply-side reasons for the disparities.
</p><p>
	Dorsey and Wolfson looked at hundreds of thousands of bids for solar installation placed in EnergySage’s 15 largest markets, including much of urban California, New York City, Washington, D.C. and metro areas in Florida, where prospective solar buyers are able to pick among bids from installers. Unsurprisingly, lower-income buyers were less likely to purchase home solar, received fewer bids overall, and, because they were likely seeking smaller systems, paid more per watt than wealthier buyers. (The researchers were able to match data from EnergySage with census data to extract demographic information about potential customers along with their location.)</p><p>
	What did stand out, however, is that <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32814" target="_blank">Black households in particular got fewer bids</a> and paid notably higher prices, a disparity that could not be explained entirely by differences in income. Low-income households were more likely to be in an area with a lower cost of living, and therefore didn’t necessarily face higher overall project costs because prices for <em>everything</em> tended to be lower. </p><p>Black households, on the other hand, received fewer bids <em>and then</em> face higher prices. “If you look at Black vs. white households, Black households get about 8% higher prices,” Dorsey told me. “On a $20,000 system, that would be $1,600.”</p><p>
	The reason, he determined, is not so much that installers don’t want to serve people they know are Black. It’s that they don’t want to serve neighborhoods they know are majority Black.
</p><p>Dorsey put the difference down to “some kind of perceived higher cost of doing business.” Part of it could be explained by installers setting up shop in areas where they think they’ll find higher demand for their services — high-income ones — and so Black neighborhoods, which are more likely to be low-income, may be literally farther away and more expensive to serve. According to the data Dorsey and Wolfson collected, there are three installers within 10 miles of white households on average, compared to two installers on average for Black households.
</p><p>
	There could also, Dorsey said, “be some implicit preference that they don’t want to go to those neighborhoods.” In the paper, Dorsey and Wolfson write that “some sellers may prefer to serve certain households or neighborhoods either because of intolerant views, crime rates, or other variables correlated with household demographic characteristics.”<br/>
</p><p>
	While the study didn’t get into remediation, fixing the income side of things should be fairly straightforward, Dorsey told me. “Just making prices lower or financing terms more comparable [to high income households] should be fairly effective,” he said.<br/>
</p><p>
	The sociogeographic side of things will be trickier to address. “That might suggest a supply side policy might be effective,” Dorsey said, “like giving installers incentives to locate in or serve communities that are getting fewer bids and facing higher prices.”
</p><p>
<span></span>Policymakers and solar advocates are very aware of the income and race disparities in solar adoptions and have come up with a slew of policies to try and narrow them<strong>. </strong>California, which has long been the epicenter of rooftop solar (with the most <a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-18-severin-borenstein" target="_self">attendant controversy</a> over how its incentives are designed), has a program that <a href="https://www.csd.ca.gov/Pages/Low-Income-Weatherization-Program.aspx" target="_blank">subsidizes low-income households</a> that want to install solar and incentives for affordable multifamily buildings to install solar<strong>.  </strong><strong></strong>
</p><p>
<strong></strong>The <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/solar-for-all-ira" target="_self"><u>Environmental Protection Agency’s $7 billion Solar For All</u></a> program also supports states, tribes, and non-profits with programs to reach low-income households. “The program will help unlock new markets for residential solar in areas that have never seen this kind of investment before,” an EPA spokesperson told Heatmap in an emailed statement. “Much of the program will fund solar projects to benefit multi-family and affordable housing, as well as community solar projects, bringing the benefits of clean energy to households that may not have had access to it before.”
</p><p>
	Another favored solution for getting solar access to those who wouldn’t otherwise have it is <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/community-solar-basics" target="_blank">community solar</a>, where households “subscribe” to small-scale solar installations and then get credits on their utility bill as if they had physically installed solar in their homes. 
</p><p>
	The share of community solar capacity that serves low-to-moderate income consumers has <a href="https://www.woodmac.com/press-releases/2024-press-releases/us-community-solar-market-to-break-14-gwdc-of-cumulative-capacity-by-2029/" target="_blank">grown</a> from 2% in 2022 to 12% this year, according to data from Wood Mackenzie and the Coalition for Community Solar Access, and they project it will continue to grow to 25% in 2025.<br/>
<span></span>
</p><p>
	The Inflation Reduction Act also includes an “adder” for community solar projects that serve lower income consumers that boosts existing subsidies by 10 to 20 percentage points. These community solar projects are “already seeing impact and projects on the ground,” Molly Knoll, vice president of policy for CCSA, told me.
</p><p>
	EnergySage’s chief executive, Charlie Hadlow, said in a statement that the company is “working diligently to ensure every eligible shopper gets three to seven quotes on our platform,” and that “we welcome more installers to sign up on our platform and are actively seeking them out, with a deliberate focus on underserved areas.” He said consumers typically save 20% using EnergySage compared to what they might get on their own, and that the company also has <a href="https://www.energysage.com/shop/community-solar/" target="_blank"><u>a marketplace for community solar</u></a>.</p><p>All that said, Dorsey is skeptical that “installing panels at individual rooftop” is even <a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-five-rooftop-solar" target="_blank">the best way to decarbonize</a>. "If you want to cost-effectively reduce emissions, it’s not clear to me rooftop solar is the way to do it as opposed to utility-scale or community solar,” he said.</p>

## Haiku gets tons of performance fixes, new FAT driver from FreeBSD, and a lot more

date: 2024-08-13, from: OS News

There&#8217;s a new Haiku activity report, and it&#8217;s a big one. A lot of bottlenecks and performance issues were addressed recently, and the list is too long and detailed for me to cover everything. Haiku developer Waddlesplash does a great job in this report detailing the various things he worked on to solve some of these bottlenecks and performance issues, and they cover everything from speeding up the readv and writev I/O calls, fixing an issue with the kernel’s device_manager lock, improving ELF symbol lookup by implementing the DT_GNU_HASH hash table, and much more. As part of working on these performance issues, Waddlesplash also fixed up Haiku&#8217;s CPU time profiler. Haiku has a built-in CPU time profiler (just called profile.) Unfortunately, it’s been rather broken for years, regularly outputting data that was either empty or just didn’t make any sense. In order to use it to try and track down some of the other bottlenecks, I spent a bunch of time fixing various bugs in it, as well as the debugger support code that it relies on to function, including to stack trace collection, buffer flushing, symbol lookup, scheduler callbacks, image load reporting, and more. I also implemented userspace-only profiling (ignoring kernel stack frames entirely), fixed some output buffer sizing issues, and fixed a race condition in thread resumption that also affected strace. While it isn’t perfect, it’s much better than before, and can now be used to profile applications and the kernel to see where CPU time is being spent; and notably it now checks the thread’s CPU time counters to detect if it “missed” profiling ticks, and if so how many. ↫ Haiku&#8217;s website Beyond these performance fixes, there&#8217;s a ton of other improvements and fixes, from better handling of HiDPI displays in HaikuDepot, improvements to CharacterMap, fixing subtitles in MediaPlayer, and tons more. Of course, there&#8217;s the bevy of driver fixes, including a major overhaul of the FAT driver, which was still largely based on old, original BeOS code because Be used the FAT driver as sample code. Haiku&#8217;s FAT driver is now based on FreeBSD&#8217;s FAT driver, which addressed a whole slew of issues. This isn&#8217;t even all of it &#8211; there&#8217;s so much more in this month&#8217;s activity report, so definitely head on over and give it a read.

## SpecOS: an x86_64 OS kernel from scratch

date: 2024-08-13, from: OS News

It&#8217;s been busy in the world of hobby and teaching/learning operating systems these past few months, and today we&#8217;ve got another one &#8211; SpecOS. SpecOS is a 64 bit operating system kernel for x86-64 processors, still in quite early stages, written in (questionable quality) C. It is (not very) powerful. This used to be 32 bit, but has been transferred to a 64 bit operating system. It uses a monolithic kernel, because I like having everything in one place. This may take some inspiration from other operating systems, but it is not UNIX based. ↫ SpecOS GitHub page It&#8217;s got the basics covered with PS/2 keyboard and VGA support, a real-time clock driver, a basic hard disk driver, and physical and virtual memory management, among other things. We&#8217;re clearly looking at a hobby project, and the author is very clear about that. A virtual machine is highly advised, as running it on real hardware is&#8230; Well, you&#8217;re on your own, basically.

## Somali American member of Congress Ilhan Omar faces repeat primary challenge

date: 2024-08-13, from: VOA News USA

Minneapolis, Minnesota — Democratic U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, one of the progressive House members known as the "Squad" and a sharp critic of how Israel has conducted the war in Gaza, is trying to avoid the fate of two of her closest allies when Minnesota holds its primary elections Tuesday.


Omar is defending her Minneapolis-area 5th District seat against a repeat challenge from former Minneapolis City Council member Don Samuels, a more centrist liberal whom she only narrowly defeated in the 2022 primary.


In the main statewide race on the ballot, conservative populist and former NBA player Royce White is facing a more conventional Republican candidate, Navy veteran Joe Fraser, for the right to challenge Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar.


Meanwhile, two newcomers are in a bitter fight for the Republican nomination to challenge Democratic Representative Angie Craig in November in the mostly suburban 2nd District.


Omar's fellow Squad member Representative Cori Bush lost the Democratic nomination in Missouri last week. Representative Jamaal Bowman of New York lost his primary in June. The only charter member not facing a primary challenge is Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts.


Both Bush and Bowman faced well-funded challengers and millions of dollars in spending by the United Democracy Project, a super political action committee affiliated with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which appears to be sitting out the Minnesota race.


But Omar isn't taking victory for granted. Omar reported spending $2.3 million before the 2022 primary. In the same period this year, she reported raising about $6.2 million. Samuels has raised about $1.4 million.


Omar — a Somali American and Muslim — came under fire from the Jamaican-born Samuels and others in her first term for comments that were widely criticized for invoking antisemitic tropes and suggesting Jewish Americans have divided loyalties. This time, Samuels has criticized her condemnation of the Israeli government's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.


While Omar has also criticized Hamas for attacking Israel and taking hostages, Samuels says she's one-sided and divisive.


The winner in the overwhelmingly Democratic district will face Republican Dalia Al-Aqidi, an Iraqi American journalist and self-described secular Muslim who calls Omar pro-Hamas and a terrorist sympathizer.


In the U.S. Senate race, White — an ally of imprisoned former Donald Trump aide Steve Bannon and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones — shocked many political observers when he defeated Fraser at the party convention for the Republican endorsement.


White's social media comments have been denounced as misogynistic, homophobic, antisemitic and profane. His legal and financial problems include unpaid child support and questionable campaign spending, including $1,200 spent at a Florida strip club after he lost his primary challenge to Omar in 2022. He argues that, as a Black man, he can broaden the party's base by appealing to voters of color in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area and others disillusioned with establishment politics.


Fraser has said White's confrontational style and message won't attract the moderates and independents needed for a competitive challenge to Klobuchar, who's seeking a fourth term. He said he offers a more mainstream approach, stressing fiscal conservativism, a strong defense, world leadership and small government. Fraser has also highlighted his 26 years in the Navy, where he was an intelligence officer and served a combat tour in Iraq.


Neither has anywhere near the resources that Klobuchar has. White last reported raising $133,000, while Fraser has taken in $68,000. Klobuchar, meanwhile, has collected about $19 million this cycle and has more than $6 million available to spend on the general election campaign.


Craig is preparing for what's expected to be Minnesota's most competitive House race in November. Vying to challenge her are former federal prosecutor Joe Teirab and defense attorney Tayler Rahm. Teirab has the support of Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson and the National Republican Congressional Committee. He was better funded than Rahm, who won the endorsement at the district convention with support from grassroots conservatives.


While Rahm announced in July that he was suspending his campaign and would instead serve as a senior adviser for Trump's Minnesota campaign, he will still be on the ballot and didn't fully pull the plug on his campaign.

<p>Amazon&#8217;s Fire tablets offer a lot of bang for the buck. With list prices starting as low as $60, they&#8217;re far cheaper than any iPad, and more affordable than most Android tablets from companies like Samsung or Lenovo. Amazon&#8217;s tablets also go on sale for even lower prices at least a few times a year. [&#8230;]</p>

## Serena: an experimental operating system for 32bit Amiga computers

date: 2024-08-13, from: OS News

Serena is an experimental operating system based on modern design principles with support for pervasive preemptive concurrency and multiple users. The kernel is object-oriented and designed to be cross-platform and future proof. It runs on Amiga systems with a 68030 or better CPU installed. One aspect that sets it aside from traditional threading-based OSs is that it is purely built around dispatch queues somewhat similar to Apple&#8217;s Grand Central Dispatch. There is no support for creating threads in user space nor in kernel space. Instead the kernel implements a virtual processor concept where it dynamically manages a pool of virtual processors. The size of the pool is automatically adjusted based on the needs of the dispatch queues and virtual processors are assigned to processes as needed. All kernel and user space concurrency is achieved by creating dispatch queues and by submitting work items to dispatch queues. Work items are simply closures (a function with associated state) from the viewpoint of the user. ↫ Serena GitHub page Serena is a remarkably advanced concept, and since it runs in an Amiga emulator just fine, there&#8217;s no need for real hardware, which is becoming ever harder to come by. It has its own unique file system, the executable file format is Atari ST GemDos (for now), and it has its own shell. It comes with a variety of drivers and services for your basic needs like keyboard and mouse input, a basic graphics drivers, a VT52 and VT100 series compatible interactive console, a floppy disk driver, and much more. Anyone can load up WinUAE and try SerenaOS out &#8211; it&#8217;s available under the MIT license.

## Trump Is Kind of Nuclear-Skeptical

</p><p>
	Dismiss Trump and his gold <a href="https://designobserver.com/feature/trump-the-logo/8477" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Stymie Extra Bold</u></a> font as tacky and tasteless if you want, but you can’t claim that the namesake behind Trump Ice, Trump Vodka, Trump University, Trump Airlines, Trump Steaks, and the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/03/11/chicago-hot-dogs-trump/81657746/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Trump footlong hotdog</u></a> doesn’t <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_things_named_after_Donald_Trump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>know how to make something stick</u></a>.

I mean, “<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/harris-donald-trump-nickname-kamabla-2024-b2593369.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Kamabla</u></a>”? Come on.
</p><p>
	Still, sometimes you can see flashes of his former self, such as last night when Trump appeared in a “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/08/elon-musk-donald-trump-interview-x/679450/?utm_campaign=galaxy-brain&utm_content=20240813&utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=Galaxy+Brain" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>conversation</u></a>” with Elon Musk on Twitter, the social media platform now a year into its own <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90927580/elon-musk-twitter-rebrand-x-bad-idea" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rocky rebrand</u></a> as X. Musk’s justification for the call was to give listeners “a feel for what Donald Trump is like in a conversation” in a non-adversarial setting (as if Trump doesn’t do <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/04/20/biden-trump-mainstream-media-interviews" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>friendly media</u></a> appearances <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-cybertruck" target="_self"><u>all the time</u></a>). But the lengthy, wide-ranging interview also offered a decent opportunity to hear Trump speak about policy without the usual teleprompter.
</p><p>
	That included some of Trump’s <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-ev-pivot-elon-musk" target="_self"><u>newly Musk-friendly thoughts</u></a> about climate.In addition to spouting some seriously dubious emissions science — Bill McKibben dubbed their two-hour chat “<a href="https://billmckibben.substack.com/p/the-dumbest-climate-conversation?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=438146&post_id=147492302&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxNDUzMSwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTQ3NDkyMzAyLCJpYXQiOjE3MjM1NTQzOTYsImV4cCI6MTcyNjE0NjM5NiwiaXNzIjoicHViLTQzODE0NiIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.A4y6Fa_VpAK96-OFGwmma9iYX-lkg3vwpHfB0VggpvQ&r=b7n&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the Dumbest Climate Conversation of All Time</u></a>” — Trump and Musk also touched on the problems facing the buildout of nuclear energy.
</p><p>
	Here is the relevant part of the conversation (I’ve omitted some of the exchange in brackets, but you can read the whole 61-page transcript <a href="https://turboscribe.ai/transcript/share/4422534834081521519/HWE18owsC2u8E5u2HpZNikyBdermlV2YSwGlTEPKJJw/donald-trump-and-elon-musk-full-transcript-august-12-2024-https-x-com-i-spaces-1nakepnklwoxl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a> if you like):
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Trump:</strong> You know, the one thing that I don’t understand is that people talk about global warming, or they talk about climate change, but they never talk about nuclear warming. And for me, that’s an immediate problem because you have, as I said, five countries where you have major nuclear and, you know, probably some others are getting there and that's very dangerous. [...]<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Musk: </strong>Yeah, and actually, there’s the bad side of nuclear, which is a nuclear war, very bad side. But there’s also, I think — nuclear electricity generation is underrated. And it’s actually, you know, people have this fear of nuclear electricity generation, but it’s actually one of the safest forms of electricity generation. [...]<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Trump:</strong> Maybe they’ll have to change the name. The name is just, it’s a rough name. There are some areas, like when you see what happened — bad branding, the branding problem. We’ll have to rebrand it. We’ll have to give it a good name. We’ll name it after you or something.</blockquote><p>
	Let’s say right off the bat, they are getting into some real stuff here. Nuclear war is, indeed, “very bad”! To give Trump credit on the branding front, too, “nuclear warming” is a pretty creative way of saying “a mass detonation of atomic bombs that ends all life on Earth.” (And possibly a clever play on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_winter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>nuclear winter</u></a>.)</p><p>
	Perhaps more importantly, though, nuclear is the largest source of carbon-free energy in the U.S. is generally considered <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/make-or-break-clean-energy#:~:text=7.-,Natrium%20Reactor,-Heatmap%20Illustration/TerraPower" target="_self"><u>crucial to balancing out</u></a> intermittent renewables as the grid decarbonizes and electricity demand <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/advanced-nuclear-data-centers">blows up</a>. Talking about nuclear in a serious way will be important — which is tricky if you buy that it has “a rough name.”
</p><p>
	Not everybody does, of course. <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em>’s Steve Hou <a href="https://x.com/stevehouf/status/1823301594491851144" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>disputed Trump’s theory (on Musk’s X, no less)</u></a>, “Nuclear doesn’t have a branding problem. It has a NIMBY problem that everyone’s ok with it in theory as long as the nuclear plant’s in someone else’s neighborhood.” <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/08/05/majority-of-americans-support-more-nuclear-power-in-the-country/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Most Americans</u></a> support nuclear power — more than offshore oil and gas drilling, fracking, or coal mining. It’s the rare issue both Democrats and Republicans <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/advance-act-nuclear" target="_self"><u>can agree on</u></a>.
</p><p>
	But that doesn’t mean nuclear <em><em>doesn’t </em></em>have a branding problem. Why else would Americans <a href="https://heatmap.news/americans-love-solar-and-want-it-on-their-roofs#:~:text=but%20ever%2Dcontroversial%20%E2%80%94-,nuclear%20power%20plant,-was%20the%20only" target="_self"><u>not want a nuclear plant</u></a> in their backyard if not for anxiety about radiation (or, relatedly, the Soviet unsightliness of cooling towers)? Trump went on in his conversation with Musk to cite the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan and, seemingly, Chernobyl (“in Russia, where they had a problem, where they, you know, a lot of bad things happened”) as the reasons why Americans are, in his opinion, rightfully jittery about nuclear energy.
</p><p>
	Musk pushed back on Trump’s examples, asserting that nuclear energy is “not as scary as people think” and that “Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed, but now they’re, like, full cities again.” Seeing as Musk <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/08/elon-musk-donald-trump-interview-x/679450/?utm_campaign=galaxy-brain&utm_content=20240813&utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=Galaxy+Brain" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mostly just let Trump say stuff</u></a> during their conversation, his moment of objection is telling: Trump’s distrust of nuclear energy suggests possible policy implications that <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2024/02/06/nuclear-is-fusing-republicans-and-democrats-00139822" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>people on the right</u></a> might not like. (Trump has expressed far more enthusiasm, however, for <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025#:~:text=It%20will%20use%20science%20to%20create%20weapons%20of%20war%20%E2%80%94%20and%20basically%20nothing%20else" target="_self"><u>building up our nuclear arsenal</u></a>.)
</p><p>
	Many in climate communications or the nuclear industry have thought long and hard about how to make nuclear energy more palatable to the public, with strategies ranging from creating <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90951504/jones-knowles-ritchie-rebrands-nuclear-power" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>imagery invoking the atom</u></a> (rather than the more obvious and ominous hourglass-shaped cooling tower) to <a href="https://www.constellationenergy.com/newsroom/2024/former-miss-america-grace-stanke-begins-career-as-nuclear-engineer-and-advocate-at-constellation.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hiring Miss America as an industry advocate</u></a>. Last fall, John Marshall, the CEO and founder of the Potential Energy Coalition, explained on a podcast that his group had found the term “<a href="https://www.nei.org/news/2023/fissionary-episode-6-john-marshall" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>new nuclear</u></a>” tests as less intimidating to the public.
</p><p>
	So sure, we may need something like a <a href="https://heatmap.news/culture/reddy-kilowatt" target="_self"><u>Reddy Kilowatt</u></a> of nuclear energy to improve messaging. That’s where Trump’s creativity runs out, though. As Heatmap’s own polling suggests, rebranding nuclear power as “Musk power” will <a href="https://heatmap.news/elon-musk-is-alienating-future-tesla-buyers-heatmap-poll-finds" target="_self"><u>probably </u><u><em><em>not</em></em></u><u> help</u></a>.

## Poland signs $10 billion deal for US Apache attack helicopters

date: 2024-08-13, from: VOA News USA

Warsaw, POLAND — Poland on Tuesday signed a $10 billion deal to buy 96 Apache attack helicopters from U.S. manufacturer Boeing in an upgrade to the country's military capabilities.


Poland has sharply accelerated the modernization of its armed forces since Russia's full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine in 2022.


"This is the landmark purchase by Poland for its armed forces of ... 96 state-of-the-art AH-64E Apache attack helicopters," Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz told reporters.


"Today we are taking a milestone in the transformation and equipping of the army," he added, speaking at the Inowroclaw air base, where the Apaches are to be stationed.


The deal is the latest in a string of contracts signed by Poland with the United States in recent days.


On Friday, Warsaw announced a deal to buy hundreds of AIM-120C AMRAAM air-to-air missiles. On Monay there was a contract to build 48 launchers for the U.S.-designed Patriot air defense systems.


Poland, a staunch ally of Ukraine, has announced it would spend more than 4% of its annual economic output on defense this year — twice NATO's target of 2%.


The Ukraine war has also solidified the relationship between the United States and Poland, a country on NATO's eastern flank that sees Washington as one of its main allies.


The Apache helicopter sale was approved last year by the U.S. State Department and Congress.


The deal "changes the face of the Polish army's operations and complements" previous purchases, Kosiniak-Kamysz said, pointing notably at the Abrams tanks that Poland bought in the past years.


According to the Polish government, the Apaches are designed to work with the tanks.


"For the Abrams, the Apache is an essential element," Kosiniak-Kamysz said.


In 2022, Poland bought 250 Abrams tanks in a modern M1A2 variant, which are expected to be delivered later this year. It will be the first country outside the United States with the tanks.


The attack helicopter agreement also envisages providing the Polish army with maintenance equipment, technical and training support, flight simulators and spare parts.


"Offset, purchase, leasing, pilot training, technology, armament — it was all negotiated together. It's a historic day for helicopter aviation," Deputy Defense Minister Pawel Bejda said.


"These $10 billion are the insurance of our country, the insurance of our freedom," Bejda added, saying that the Apaches would serve the Polish efforts to "deter those who have evil intentions."


The first U.S.-made helicopters are to be delivered in 2028, but some Polish pilots have already begun training on them.


The Apaches will replace outdated Russian Mi-24 helicopters.

## Ezra Klein and Nate Silver

date: 2024-08-13, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I had another morning of driving around so I listened to a bunch of podcasts about how the campaign is going, all good news for Democrats which of course makes me happy. The last podcast I listened to was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-nate-silver.html">Ezra Klein's interview with Nate Silver</a>. I only listened to the first 20 minutes because I ran out of time. I may pick it up later on my afternoon walk (it's a gorgeous day in the mountains). </p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/13/trafficUptight.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">They talked about their bond as old school bloggers. I didn't know either of them when they were starting out, which is kind of sad -- most of the bloggers I heard from in that period were mad at me the way they are mad at Elon Musk now. Both Silver and Klein campaigned for Biden to step aside, which I felt it was inappropriate -- for Silver who was/is a trusted polling analyst, and Klein who is a columnist for the NYT. I had already listened to Klein's interview with Nancy Pelosi. But I really don't like that both of them crossed a line I felt they had no business crossing, becoming an advocate rather than a journalist. I can't thikn about either of them without thinking about that. But I listened anyway, because I'm interested in both, and esp the combination. </p>
<p>The discussion was interesting and even agreeable until Klein asked Silver about his relationship with Peter Thiel. I had read that Silver was connected to Thiel in some way. Before they moved on neither commented on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawker#Hulk_Hogan_sex_tape">Thiel's funding</a> of the Hulk Hogan lawsuit that destroyed Gawker. I don't know how they can both, for their careers, which depend on free speech, still have a kind word for Thiel. I never liked Gawker, they made fun of me, and others, in horrific ways, that weren't even based on facts, the kind of bullshit pre-teens make up about people when they can't think of anything else to say. Even though they hurt me, embarrassed me, aroused my hate, even if I had the kind of money Thiel has, I never in a million years would use that money to destroy them. </p>
<p>Thiel's wealth is a weapon aimed at all our freedom. This is something imho that has to at least be <i>mentioned</i> when a journalist talks about Thiel, and neither of them did. I guess they feel safe from Thiel's attacks, perhaps because they have adjusted their writing so as to never risk offending him, which totally undermines their integrity, if so. A good way to prove that's not true would be to never mention him without saying his behavior the Hulk Hogan vs Gawker was reprehensible. </p>
<p>I still listened, even though they provoked my ire in a very fundamental way. I'd be interested in hearing from them, as a fellow old school blogger, if they justify Thiel's funding of the Hogan lawsuit and if so, how. But I expect that both of them consider themselves in an elite class and wouldn't deign to explain themselves, or the truth is something they don't want disclosed. Either way, to be blogger-blunt, they both suck. </p>
<p>Update: I listened to more of the interview. I think these guys need to get out more. The reason Harris is having such a strong response is that we the voters are desperate to not have another term for Trump. We understand the stakes in the election. You always try to reduce it to numbers, when the facts are available at a more human level. The reason we love Kamala is born of desperation. Stop talking to each other, you already know why we care, because underneath it all <i>you</i> care because you're human and you come from America too. And btw about VCs, I know a lot about them, I'm assuming at some point Klein will leave the NYT to make millions with Thiel, and I imagine Silver is already doing that, but you both have the disease. You assume great money makes people interesting. It can make them dangerous. </p>

## On that two-hour convo between Trump and Musk

date: 2024-08-13, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Elon Musk made news yesterday during his conversation with former President Donald Trump, which live-streamed on X. In it, Musk advocated for reducing federal government spending and reducing deficits as a way of fighting inflation, and he angled for a role in the administration if Trump wins. Plus, what would it take to see an emergency interest rate cut? Then, A generally strong job market has led to economic improvements for people without higher levels of education.</p>

## The UK Should be Careful Not to Hand the Middle East to China

The UK's commitment to its relationship with Oman remains stable but it should not take its position west of India for granted. As the UK turns its gaze to the Indo-Pacific, Beijing is moving to strengthen its relations with Oman and increase its influence in the region.

## Chrome iOS browser on Blink

date: 2024-08-13, from: OS News

Earlier this year, under pressure from the European Union, Apple was finally forced to open up iOS and allow alternative browser engines, at least in the EU. Up until then, Apple only allowed its own WebKit engine to run on iOS, meaning that even what seemed like third-party browsers &#8211; Chrome, Firefox, and so on &#8211; were all just Safari skins, running Apple&#8217;s WebKit underneath (with additional restrictions to make them perform worse than Safari). Even with other browser engines now being allowed on iOS in the EU, there&#8217;s still hurdles, as Apple requires browser makers to maintain two different browsers, one for the EU, and another one for the rest of the world. It seems the Chromium community is already working on bringing the Chromium Blink browser engine to iOS, but there&#8217;s still a lot of work to be done. A blog post by the open source consultancy company Igalia digs into the details, since they are contributing to the effort. While they&#8217;ve got the basics covered, it&#8217;s far from completed or ready for release. We’ve briefly looked at the current status of the project so far, but many functionalities still need to be supported. For example, regarding UI features, functionalities such as printing preview, download, text selection, request desktop site, zoom text, translate, find in page, and touch events are not yet implemented or are not functioning correctly. Moreover, there are numerous failing or skipped tests in unit tests, browser tests, and web tests. Ensuring that these tests are enabled and passing the test should also be a key focus moving forward. ↫ Gyuyoung Weblog I don&#8217;t use iOS, nor do I intend to any time soon, but the coming availability of browser engines that compete with WebKit is going to be great for the web. I&#8217;ve heard from so many web developers that Safari on iOS is a bit of a nightmare to support, since without any competition on iOS it often stagnates and lags behind in supporting features other browsers already implemented. With WebKit on iOS facing competition, that might change. Now, there&#8217;s a line of thought that all this will do is make Chrome even more dominant, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going to be an issue. Safari is still the default for most people, and changing defaults is not something most people will do, especially not the average iOS user. On top of that, this is only available in the EU, so I honestly don&#8217;t think we have to worry about this any time soon, but obviously, we do have to remain vigilant.

## Harris faces misogyny, racism in bid for White House

Critics of Vice President Kamala Harris have used her gender as a cudgel, saying subtly and overtly that a woman cannot hold the most powerful job in the free world. Gender scholars say those railing against Harris have also chosen another line of attack: her race. VOA’s Anita Powell reports from the White House.

The storm is expected to bring strong winds, heavy rain, flooding, and landslides to the islands before turning north toward Bermuda and possibly strengthening into a hurricane by Thursday. Forecasters don’t think Ernesto will make landfall on the U.S. mainland but said it could bring dangerous rip currents to the East Coast. This is the fifth named storm of the 2024 season and comes just a little over a week after Hurricane Debby struck Florida and swamped states along the southeast for several days.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

Biden allows more tariff-free solar cell imports</h3><p>President Biden yesterday gave <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/08/12/a-proclamation-to-further-facilitate-positive-adjustment-to-competition-from-imports-of-certain-crystalline-silicon-photovoltaic-cells-whether-or-not-partially-or-fully-assembled-into-other-products-2/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--WGkyQwYlke6goIEqe6j0InLVNeOgBhwkJaryK1q9KBQANSYC9VHJJsIAgNefEFR_Axmy2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the green light</a> to additional tariff-free imports of solar cells, more than doubling the volume allowed – from 5 GW to 12.5 GW. The move is an effort to support production for domestic panel makers and put Americans to work manufacturing clean energy tech. Somewhat relatedly, New Mexico’s Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham announced <a href="https://www.ebonsolar.com/news/30?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--WGkyQwYlke6goIEqe6j0InLVNeOgBhwkJaryK1q9KBQANSYC9VHJJsIAgNefEFR_Axmy2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recently</a> that Ebon Solar will build a $942 million solar cell factory in the state. The facility will create more than 900 jobs. New Mexico is also set to be home to the largest solar cell and panel factory in the country when Maxeon Solar Technologies gets its planned facility up and running. “While a huge number of solar panel factories are opening in the U.S., there’s still a dearth of domestic supply of earlier stages of the supply chain – including solar cells,” <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/08/12/new-mexico-solar-cell-factory/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--WGkyQwYlke6goIEqe6j0InLVNeOgBhwkJaryK1q9KBQANSYC9VHJJsIAgNefEFR_Axmy2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Michelle Lewis at <em><em>Electrek</em></em>.</p><h3>3. Heatmap poll: Wildlife is top concern for Americans when it comes to renewable energy projects</h3><p><strong></strong>In case you missed it yesterday: <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/renewables-wildlife-impact?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--WGkyQwYlke6goIEqe6j0InLVNeOgBhwkJaryK1q9KBQANSYC9VHJJsIAgNefEFR_Axmy2" rel="noopener" target="_self">Exclusive Heatmap polling</a> conducted in April found the top concern both Democrats and Republicans have with renewable energy projects in their areas is the harm those facilities could inflict on wildlife. Notably, almost half of all Democrats said consequences for wildlife from projects would elicit “strong concern” from them. Other big concerns for Republicans such as reliability during extreme weather and land use factors received nowhere near the same level of Democratic agreement. The polling result underscores a real vulnerability that energy projects labeled “clean” can face when a would-be host community is faced with information indicating they may produce pollution or harm to the environment, <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/renewables-wildlife-impact?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--WGkyQwYlke6goIEqe6j0InLVNeOgBhwkJaryK1q9KBQANSYC9VHJJsIAgNefEFR_Axmy2" rel="noopener" target="_self">wrote Heatmap’s Jael Holzman</a>. “These conflicts are real, I’m not going to say they aren’t. That’s why I say there are appropriate places to site and inappropriate places to site,” Matt Kirby, senior director of energy and landscape conservation for the National Parks Conservation Association, told Holzman. “I hope that industry understands that it needs to have social license to operate, and it will only be able to get that if they’re a good player.”</p><h3>4.

## “Left behind” Rust Belt workers have seen gains in recent years

date: 2024-08-13, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>An analysis from The Economist looks at people who feel &#8220;left behind&#8221; in America — those who got the short end of globalization and deindustrialization, people who took the biggest hits in recent decades from not having advanced education — and shows that that group has been seeing economic improvement under the Trump and Biden administrations. Plus, Harris and Trump look to nix federal taxes on tips, and consumers expect inflation to become less of a problem.</p>

## Millions of campaign dollars aimed at tilting school voucher battle are flowing into state races

date: 2024-08-13, from: VOA News USA

NASHVILLE, Tenn.  — Millions of dollars are being spent this year to steer voters toward candidates for Republican-led Legislatures who not only support school vouchers, but will become key figures in implementing school choice programs in states across the U.S.


Most recently, national pro-voucher advocates declared victory after spending more than $4.5 million in Tennessee's primary election to defend and elect legislative candidates they claim will support school choice proposals in 2025 when state lawmakers are slated to return to the Capitol to enact policy.


Meanwhile, at least $14.8 million was spent by similar advocacy groups in the Texas primary election earlier in May to oust and replace voucher opponents. In Idaho, hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent on candidates who both opposed and supported school vouchers in the rural mountain-west state.


The spending spree is backed by the nation's most high-profile voucher influencers, including the School Freedom Fund, a pro-voucher group tied to Club for Growth; the American Federation for Children, which was founded by former Trump administration Education Secretary Betsy DeVos; and Americans for Prosperity, the Koch family’s well-heeled free-market group.


Their focus is often on primary elections because in Republican-dominated states, primaries are seen as the most competitive hurdle to getting elected.


“Make no mistake — if you call yourself a Republican and oppose school freedom, you should expect to lose your next primary,” said David McIntosh, president of the School Freedom Fund, said in a statement shortly after Tennessee's primary election. “As we continue to hear from different governors, we plan on repeating our results from Tennessee and Texas across the country. The school freedom revolution is just beginning.”


Thirty-two states have implemented some sort of voucher program in the U.S., and some have been in place for decades, often with strict income requirements or narrowly tailored for students with disabilities.


Yet, over the years, there's been a noticeable push among Republican leaders to make available taxpayer-funded vouchers, or scholarships that can follow a child regardless of income to any public or private school. About a dozen states now have such programs. But proposals are being considered in many more, with varying degrees of legislative support.




Idaho, Tennessee and Texas all weighed sweeping school voucher proposals over the past year, but faced resistance not only from Democrats — who don’t hold as much political power — but also Republican members wary of directing public education dollars away from their districts.


Tennessee's Republican Gov. Bill Lee was forced to abandon his plans for universal school choice earlier this year after divisions inside the GOP-controlled Statehouse failed to come to a consensus on key specifics.


The failure prompted Lee to break with his previous stance of remaining quiet during GOP primary elections and instead publicly pick favorites this year in a handful of legislative races.


Additionally, outside groups like Club for Growth, American Federation for Children, Americans for Prosperity Action, and others poured $4.5 million across 16 House and Senate legislative races. Three of the open primaries saw almost a million dollars spent in each of the races.


Club for Growth spent the majority of the money, pouring $3.6 million across five races and ultimately winning four of those seats.


Lee didn't endorse any opponents of a sitting Republican incumbent, but he did throw support behind candidates in four open legislative seats — three of which were successful.


The modest gains for Lee's cause came at a big political cost.


After Lee endorsed Sen. Jon Lundberg, this year's voucher bill sponsor, former President Donald Trump backed Lundberg's opponent, Bobby Harshbarger, son of U.S. Rep. Diane Harshbarger. After Harshbarger was declared the winner, Trump swiped at Lee on social media, calling him a RINO, or “Republican in Name Only" even though he endorsed Lee in his 2022 reelection.


Lee has so far brushed aside the criticism, and instead released a statement declaring that Republican primary voters “sent a clear message: It’s time to deliver school choice for Tennessee families."


Focusing solely on primary voters may be a winning strategy to securing key state level races, but it comes at a cost of electing candidates who may not represent the average voter, said John Geer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University.


“A very small proportion of the Tennessee voting public is driving these outcomes, that's not good for democracy,” he said.


In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott also touted major wins for voucher advocates in the aftermath of the state's runoff primary election in May.


Months prior, back in late 2023, a group of House Republicans joined Democrats to help defeat a school voucher bill — delivering a blow to one of Abbott's top legislative priorities.


Similar to the playbook used in Tennessee, Abbott and national voucher groups pivoted to ousting voucher opponents in the primary election in order to secure a legislative victory in 2025.


Club for Growth ultimately took credit for removing 10 GOP incumbents who had opposed Abbott's voucher push after targeting 14 races in primary and runoff election. Club for Growth reported spending $8.8 million and Abbott spent at least $6 million between the primary and runoff elections.


“The Texas legislature now has enough votes to pass school choice," Abbott posted after the runoff election.


And in Idaho, four anti-school voucher Republican incumbents lost their reelection bids after the American for Children PAC spent more than $300,000 to promote school choice candidates.


During the 2022 election cycle, the organization spent $9 million on state legislative races to support school choice friendly candidates but CEO Tommy Schultz promised to spend “at least $10 million” this year.


“To date, AFC and its affiliates have deployed more than $9 million in state legislative primary elections across the country, and we will spend millions more in the general election to advance school choice policies for American families,” Schultz said in a statement to AP.

## IndieWeb Carnival: Rituals

date: 2024-08-13, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>Ritual, <em>a sequence of activities involving gestures, words, actions, or revered objects.</em> Nothing in my life fits that definition.</p>
<p>That’s it, that was my entry for this month’s IndieWeb Carnival on the topic of Rituals. See you next month!</p>
<p>I’m just kidding. Well, I’m partly kidding. I’m serious when I say that I don’t have anything that fits that definition in my life. I’d love to, but I don’t. I’ve always been fascinated by rituals and strict routines. And believe me when I say that I tried to implement them in my life many many times before but always failed. I tried it with my meditation routine, with my reading habits, and with my sleeping schedule. Nothing sticks and introducing a ritual so far has been close to impossible. I don’t know why. I’m just bad at living a structured life even though I’d love to. But I think that’s mostly because I’m not really happy with the life I’m currently living and settling into a routine is hard when you know, deep down, that you want to change everything.</p>
<p>That said, rituals are awesome. There’s something deeply enjoyable in seeing someone performing something in a very ritualistic way. Which is why I always enjoyed things like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_tea_ceremony">Japanese tea ceremony</a>. This idea of doing something the same way over and over again is very appealing to me. And who knows, maybe one day I’ll manage to do the same myself.</p>                <hr>
                <p>Thank you for keeping RSS alive. You're awesome.</p>

## 2024-08-11 Serving bare git on the web

date: 2024-08-13, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-11-serving-bare-git-on-the-web">2024-08-11 Serving bare git on the web</h1>

<p>In the old days, I used <code>cgit</code> to render my git repositories on the web.
It&rsquo;s simple to set up since it&rsquo;s a CGI script.
This is ideal for URLs that get very few hits.
When nobody is requesting the URL, the CGI script isn&rsquo;t running and no resources are being used.
When a URL is requested, however, the CGI script loads, the interpreter loads, the libraries load, the script executes…
It&rsquo;s an expensive end-point!
And you know how it is.
The web is full of leeches and bad bots, crawlers and idiots.
Having an expensive end-point means it needs protection.</p>

<p>For I while I thought that <code>legit</code> was the answer.
It was nice and fast and all that.
But recently, <code>git clone</code> no longer worked.
It calls <code>git upload-pack</code> as an intermediate workaround for <a href="https://github.com/go-git/go-git/issues/1062">#1062</a>.
This was failing for some reason, however.
I tinkered with it for a while but didn&rsquo;t get anywhere.</p>

<p>Then I started thinking about <a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org">@Sandra</a>&rsquo;s post on <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/hosting-git-repos">hosting git repos</a>.
I made some changes to my Apache config and now <code>git clone</code> works again.</p>

<p>The key is that you need a <code>post-update</code> hook that calls <code>git update-server-info</code>.
Each git repository already comes with a <code>post-update.sample</code> hook containing the necessary code, so I needed to loop over all the bare repositories I had and rename the example hook.</p>

<p>Using the Fish shell:</p>

<pre><code>for d in *.git
    sudo -u git mv $d/hooks/post-update.sample $d/hooks/post-update
end
</code></pre>

<p>Sadly, this is not good enough.</p>

<p>In order to generate an <code>index.html</code> file for every repository, I need a hook that regenerates it.
If you know how to determine whether regeneration can be skipped, I&rsquo;d love to hear how to that.</p>

<p>This hook also updates or adds the <code>AddDescription</code> lines I need.</p>

<p>I prepared a hook that I wanted to install in every repository and saved it as <code>~/post-update</code>.</p>

<p>This is what it looks like, using the Fish shell:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish

git update-server-info

# create index.html
set branch (git branch --show-current)
set template (cat /home/git/.readme.html | string collect)
set title (basename (pwd))
set body (git show $branch:README.md | cmark --to html | string collect)
printf &quot;$template&quot; &quot;$title&quot; &quot;$body&quot; &quot;$title&quot; &gt; index.html

# update description
set description (cat description)
sed --in-place=~ --expression &quot;/ $title/d&quot; /home/git/.htaccess
printf &quot;AddDescription \&quot;$description\&quot; $title\n&quot; &gt;&gt; /home/git/.htaccess
</code></pre>

<p>(I need the title twice, once for the title and once for the reminder on how to clone.)</p>

<p>I turn Markdown into HTML using <code>cmark</code>.
Common Mark is the closest we have to a standard, I guess.</p>

<p>The template <code>/home/git/.readme.html</code> looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;format-detection&quot; content=&quot;telephone=no&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;%s&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
html { max-width: 70ch; padding: 1ch; margin: auto; }
body { hyphens: auto; }
    &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;nav&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://src.alexschroeder.ch/&quot;&gt;Source code repositories&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/nav&gt;
    &lt;main&gt;
%s&lt;/main&gt;
    &lt;footer&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Clone&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;pre&gt;
&lt;mark&gt;git clone https://src.alexschroeder.ch/%s&lt;/mark&gt;
      &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/footer&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So now I needed to distribute the <code>post-update</code> hook to every repository and run it once.
I wrote yet another Fish script, <code>~/recreate-index</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
for d in /home/git/*.git
    echo $d
    cd $d
    cp ~/post-update hooks/
    chown git:git hooks/post-update
    chmod 775 hooks/post-update
    sudo -u git git hook run post-update
end
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently hosting 95 repositories according to <code>ls -d /home/git/*.git | wc -l</code>.
Some of these don&rsquo;t have a <code>README.md</code> file.
Should I ever touch them again, I&rsquo;ll have to investigate.</p>

<p>Now, for the Apache web server – I changed my site to the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:443&gt;
    ServerAdmin alex@alexschroeder.ch
    ServerName src.alexschroeder.ch
    Include conf-enabled/blocklist.conf
    SSLEngine on
    DocumentRoot /home/git
   &lt;Directory /home/git&gt;
        Options Indexes
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>/home/git</code> directory has an <code>.htaccess</code> file that starts out containing the following:</p>

<pre><code>HeaderName .top.html
IndexOptions SuppressIcon SuppressSize FancyIndexing HTMLTable IgnoreCase
IndexOrderDefault Descending Date
IndexHeadInsert &quot;&lt;meta name=\&quot;viewport\&quot; content=\&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1\&quot;&gt;&quot;
IndexOptions Charset=UTF-8
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>.top.html</code> file contains a fragment to add to the top of the index:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
body { max-width: 80ch }
table { overflow-x: auto }
td { padding: 0.5ex 1em 0 0; white-space: nowrap }
td:nth-child(3) { white-space: wrap }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Source code repositories&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Hello!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I'm Alex Schroeder.
  These are my source code repositories. You can find out more about me on
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexschroeder.ch/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;. There, you'll also find a page
  listing ways to &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexschroeder.ch/view/Contact&quot;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As for the git repositories, you should be able to clone them as they are.
  For example:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
  git clone https://src.alexschroeder.ch/oddmu.git
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

<p><strong>2024-08-12</strong>. I wondered about links from the README to local files.
Right now, linking to images and files hosted in the same repository doesn&rsquo;t work since they don&rsquo;t exist in the raw repository.
The question then becomes, as far as I am concerned, whether this README is supposed to speak to developers or end-users?
If it is for developers, then pictures, screenshots, PDF files and all of that don&rsquo;t need to be linked from the repository.
If you are interested in these things, do a <code>git clone --depth 1</code> and investigate locally.</p>

<p>If the repository is for the end users, however, things are harder.
The <code>post-update</code> hook should extract all the local files linked to from the README.
Something like the following, perhaps:</p>

<pre><code>for file in (printf &quot;%s\n&quot; $body | /home/oddmu/oddmu links - | egrep -v '^(https?:|mailto:|/)')
    set dir (dirname $file)
    if test ! -d $dir
        mkdir -p $dir
    end
    echo $file; sudo -u git git show $branch:$file &gt; $file
end
</code></pre>

<p>This uses <a href="oddmu">oddmu</a> to extract the links from a Markdown file, creates the necessary directories and checks out the files.</p>

<p>But if the files are no longer linked from the README, they are not deleted.
If a directory is linked from the README (I have done this! 🤦), the checkout won&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>I think the better way forward is to move this information elsewhere.
The README is not the documentation.</p>

<p>And with that, I think I did it! Serving git repositories from static files. A single directory per project containing the bare git data and a single <code>index.html</code> file. No more gazillion end points for crawlers to lose themselves.</p>

## Elon Musk interview of Trump marred by technical issues

date: 2024-08-13, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's interview with billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk finally got underway on Musk's social media platform X on Monday evening, following a lengthy delay caused by technical problems that kept many users from accessing the live stream.


Musk, who has endorsed Trump, began the event at 8:42 p.m., more than 40 minutes after the scheduled start time. He blamed the difficulties on a distributed denial-of-service attack, in which a server or network is flooded with traffic in an attempt to shut it down, though his claim was not confirmed.


More than 1.3 million people were listening about 45 minutes into the conversation, according to a counter on X.


Trump sought to turn the problems into a positive, congratulating Musk on the number of people trying to tune in.


The former president sounded at times as if he had a lisp, many listeners on X pointed out. Some said it made him sound like a cartoon character, others suggested it could be due to audio compression issues.


The technical issues recalled a similar event on X in May 2023, when Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suffered a chaotic start to his bid for the Republican presidential nomination due to glitches on the platform.


At the time, Trump mocked DeSantis on his own, social media platform, Truth Social. "My Red Button is bigger, better, stronger, and is working (TRUTH!)" Trump posted, "Yours does not."


Ahead of Monday's event, Musk had written: "Am going to do some system scaling tests tonight & tomorrow in advance of the conversation." X did not respond to requests for details or evidence of the alleged cyberattack.


Musk spent much of the early part of the interview lauding Trump for his bravery during the attempt on his life on July 13, when his ear was struck by a bullet.


Musk, the world's richest person, announced his support for Trump shortly after the shooting. He backed Democratic President Joe Biden in 2020 but has tacked rightward since.


Trump said he plans to return to Butler, Pennsylvania, the site of the attack, for a rally in October.


As the conversation unfolded, Trump delivered his usual mix of grievances, exaggerated claims and personal attacks, with Musk offering occasional encouragement.


Trump claimed without evidence that Russia would not have invaded Ukraine if he were still president and praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un — all authoritarian strongmen — as at the "top of their game."


He also expressed anger that Vice President Kamala Harris had been swapped in for Biden on the Democratic ticket.


"She hasn't done an interview since this whole scam started," Trump said, claiming falsely that Biden dropping off the ticket was a "coup." Trump had been leading Biden in many polls of battleground states likely to be critical to the outcome of the Nov. 5 election but is now trailing Harris in some of the same states.


In an interview that was light on policy detail, Trump also appeared to praise Musk for firing workers.


"You're the greatest cutter. I mean, I look at what you do. You walk in, you just say: ‘You want to quit?’ They go on strike — I won't mention the name of the company — but they go on strike. And you say: 'That's OK, you’re all gone.'"


Trump back on X


The interview provided an opportunity for Trump to seize the limelight at a time when his campaign is facing new headwinds.


Harris has erased Trump's lead in opinion polls and energized Democratic voters with a series of high-energy rallies since she replaced Biden as the party's candidate three weeks ago. Her momentum could get another boost from the Democratic National Convention next week in Chicago.


Trump returned to X, formerly known as Twitter, with a series of posts on Monday for the first time in a year, reviving an account that had served as a main method of communication in previous campaigns and his four years in the White House, including his followers' Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.


Trump's access to his account, @realDonaldTrump, was restored a month into Musk's ownership of X after being suspended by the platform's previous owners following the Jan. 6 attack, citing concerns he would incite violence.


Trump frequently posts on his Truth Social platform, which was launched in February 2022, but his posts there reach a much smaller audience than on X.


Musk backs Trump


Musk, who heads electric car company Tesla, has echoed Trump's false claims about voter fraud and Biden's immigration policies.


Musk has started an external super PAC spending group to support Trump's campaign. The political action committee is now under investigation in Michigan for possible violations of state laws on gathering voter information.


Trump, a longstanding critic of electric vehicles, shifted gears after Musk's endorsement.


"I'm for electric cars. I have to be, because Elon endorsed me very strongly. So I have no choice," Trump said at an early August rally.


United Auto Workers President Shawn Fein, campaigning in support of Harris, called Trump a "sellout."


The Biden administration has worked to popularize electric vehicles through tax breaks and other support as part of its broader goal of reducing carbon emissions blamed for climate change.


Republicans in Congress, including Trump's running mate Senator JD Vance, have opposed those subsidies.

## Judge rules RFK Jr. not a state resident, can't be on New York ballot

date: 2024-08-13, from: VOA News USA

ALBANY, N.Y.  — A judge ruled Monday that independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s name should not appear on New York's ballot, saying that he falsely claimed a New York residence on nominating petitions despite living in California.


Kennedy's lawyers quickly vowed to appeal ahead of the Aug. 15 deadline. If the judge's ruling is upheld, it would not only keep Kennedy off the ballot in New York but could also lead to challenges in other states where he used an address in New York City's suburbs to gather signatures.


The ruling came after a North Carolina judge decided earlier Monday that Kennedy can remain on that state's ballot following a separate challenge on different grounds.


Judge Christina Ryba, in her 34-page decision, said the rented bedroom Kennedy claimed as his home in the state wasn't a "bona fide and legitimate residence, but merely a 'sham' address that he assumed for the purpose of maintaining his voter registration" and furthering his political candidacy.


"Given the size and appearance of the spare bedroom as shown in the photographs admitted into evidence, the Court finds Kennedy's testimony that he may return to that bedroom to reside with his wife, family members, multiple pets, and all of his personal belongings to be highly improbable, if not preposterous," the judge wrote.


Ryba said evidence submitted in trial showed Kennedy had a "long-standing pattern" of borrowing addresses from friends and relatives so he could maintain his voter registration in New York State while actually residing in California.


"Using a friend's address for political and voting purposes, while barely stepping foot on the premises, does not equate to residency under the Election Law," the judge wrote. "To hold otherwise would establish a dangerous precedent and open the door to the fraud and political mischief that the Election Law residency rules were designed to prevent."


Clear Choice Action, the Democrat-aligned political action committee that backed the legal challenge, said the ruling makes it clear that Kennedy "lied about his residency and provided a false address on his filing papers and candidate petitions in New York, intentionally misleading election officials and betraying voters' trust."


The lawsuit, filed on behalf of several voters in the state, claims Kennedy's state nominating petition falsely listed a residence in well-to-do Katonah while actually living in the Los Angeles area since 2014, when he married "Curb Your Enthusiasm" actor Cheryl Hines.


Kennedy, who led a New York-based environmental group for decades and whose namesake father was a New York senator, argued during the trial that he has lifelong ties to New York and intends to move back.


During the trial, which ran for less than four days, Kennedy said he currently rents a room in a friend's home in Katonah, about 65 kilometers north of midtown Manhattan, though has only slept in that room once due to his constant campaign travel.


The 70-year-old candidate testified that his move to California a decade ago was so he could be with his wife, and that he always planned to return to New York.


Barbara Moss, who rents the room to Kennedy, testified that he pays her $500 a month. But she acknowledged there is no written lease and that Kennedy's first payment wasn't made until after the New York Post published a story casting doubt on Kennedy's claim that he lived at that address.


The judge also heard from a longtime friend of Kennedy's who said the candidate had regularly been an overnight guest at his own Westchester home from 2014 through 2017, but was not a tenant there as Kennedy had claimed.


Attorneys representing several New York voters grilled Kennedy in often heated exchanges as they sought to make their case, pointing to government documents including a federal statement of candidacy with a California address, and even a social media video in which Kennedy talks about training ravens at his Los Angeles home.


"Kennedy's testimony that none of the furniture, bedding and other decorative items in the spare bedroom belonged to him, as well as his testimony that his wife and family, his extensive book collection, and his wide assortment of domestic and exotic pets all remained in California, was further compelling evidence that Kennedy lacks the necessary physical presence and intent to remain" at the Katonah address, the judge wrote in her ruling.


Kennedy has the potential to do better than any independent presidential candidate in decades thanks to his famous name and a loyal base. Both Democrat and Republican strategists have expressed concerns that he could affect their candidate's chances.


Kennedy's campaign has said he has enough signatures to qualify in a majority of states, but his ballot drive has faced challenges and lawsuits in several.


Kennedy has told reporters that getting knocked off the ballot in New York could lead to lawsuits in other states where his campaign listed the same address.


After the trial ended Thursday, Kennedy argued that people who signed his petitions deserve a chance to vote for him.


"Those Americans want to see me on the ballot. They want to have a choice," he said.

## FBI investigating after Trump campaign says it was hacked by Iran

date: 2024-08-13, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. FBI said on Monday it was investigating after Donald Trump's presidential campaign said its internal communications were hacked and the campaign blamed the Iranian government.


The former president said on Saturday that Microsoft had informed his campaign that Iran had hacked one of its websites. Trump said Iran was "only able to get publicly available information."


The FBI is also investigating an alleged hack targeting advisers to the campaign of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, The Washington Post reported on Monday.


The FBI began the investigation in June, when Biden was still running for president, suspecting that Iran was behind the attempts to steal data from two U.S. presidential campaigns, the newspaper said, citing sources.


The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee after Biden withdrew his bid last month.


The Iranian government has denied that it hacked the Trump campaign.


Trump's campaign has pointed to a report on Friday by Microsoft researchers that indicated that Iranian government-linked hackers tried breaking into the account of a "high-ranking official" on a U.S. presidential campaign in June.


The report added that the hackers took over an account belonging to a former political adviser and then used it to target the official. It did not provide further details on the targets' identities.
