<h2 id="json-feed-for-indexing">2024-08-16 JSON feed for indexing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-16, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-08-16-json-feed-for-indexing">
2024-08-16 JSON feed for indexing
</h1>
<p>
Recently,
<a class="account" href="https://toot.cat/@dredmorbius" title="@dredmorbius@toot.cat"><span
class="citation" data-cites="dredmorbius">@dredmorbius</span></a> wrote
about Google and search and posed the question:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What if websites indexed their own content, and published a permuted
index in a standard format, in a cache-and-forward model similar to how
DNS works?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A while ago I wondered about
<a href="2023-03-07_A_vision_for_search">self-published indexes</a>. We
have software to generate feeds. Why not software to generate indexes?
Back then I proposed a JSON format. Today I finally took a look at
<a href="https://www.jsonfeed.org/version/1.1/">JSON Feed</a>. I think
it has everything we need.
</p>
<p>
Take a look at the example for this site:
<a href="/.well-known/search-feed.json.gz">.well-known/search-feed.json.gz</a>.
This file has about 251KiB. The source material is 6740 Markdown pages,
a total of about 21MiB.
</p>
<p>
Using the <code>next_url</code> attribute, it would be possible to split
this file up into chunks of 100 pages each, or a chunk per year, if the
platform promises that older pages never change. This wouldn’t work for
my wiki, but perhaps it would for certain platforms. Somebody will have
write up a best-practice on how to use HTTP headers to avoid downloading
the whole file when nothing has changed. Sadly,
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-13">section
13 of RFC 2616</a> is pretty convoluted. Basically something about the
use of If-Modified-Since and ETags headers.
</p>
<p>
I also find <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5005">RFC
5005</a> to be very instructive in how to think about feeds for
archiving.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://neuromatch.social/@jonny" title="@jonny@neuromatch.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="jonny">@jonny</span></a> commented, saying
that it was important to think about how search indexes were going to be
used:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
so given that no single machine would or should store a whole index of
the internet or even all your local internet, you can go a few ways with
that, take the global quorum sensing path and you get a bigass global
dht-like thing like ipfs. if instead you think there should be some
structure, then you need proximity. is that social proximity where we
swap indexes between people we know? or webring like proximity dependent
on pages linking to each other and mutually indexing their neighborhood?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s an interesting question but I think I want incremental improvements
to the current situation. So if a person has a website right now, on
server, what’s the simplest thing they can do so that they aren’t
drowned in crawlers and can still be found via search? That would be
publishing an index, analogous to publishing a feed. Having more search
engines (even if using legacy centralized architecture) would be better
than what we have now. Not depending on crawlers would be better what we
have now.
</p>
<p>
In terms of decentralisation, I think I like community search engines
like lieu. The idea is great: a community lists a bunch of sites. Lieu
generates a web ring and crawls them to build an index of all the member
sites. Instead of crawling, it could fetch the indexes. This would be
much better than what it does right now, because right now, lieu uses
colly for crawling and colly ignores robots.txt. This means that
<a href="2024-06-22-lieu">lieu instantly bans itself when it visits my
site</a> because it’s not rate limited. It’s just an implementation
detail, but sadly I am biased. I’ve been on a Butlerian Jihad since 2009
when I discover that <a href="2009-10-15_Network_Traffic">over 30% of
all requests I serve from my sites are for machines, not humans</a>.
</p>
<p>
It makes me want to raise my keyboard and scream “CO₂ for the CO₂ god!!”
</p>
<p>
Somebody should draw a Hacker Elric doing that, standing on a mountain
of electro-trash with the burnt and dead landscape of the
post-apocalypse in the background.
</p>
<p>
But back to the problem of indexing. Right now, search engine operators
and their parasites, the search engine optimisation enterprises, crawls
every single page including page histories, page diffs, and more, on my
wikis. If every wanna-be search engine downloaded my index once a day, I
would be saving resources. Whether that’s a step in the right direction,
I don’t know.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://neuromatch.social/@jonny" title="@jonny@neuromatch.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="jonny">@jonny</span></a> also said:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
i just think that the ability to fundamentally depart from the
commercial structure of the web and all its brokenness doesn’t happen
gradually and esp. not with the server/client stack we have now
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Indeed, there must be another way. I just don’t see it, right now. It’s
always hard to imagine a new world while you’re still living in the old
one. I’m sure the solution will seem obvious to the next generation,
looking back.

id="pentagon-leaker-teixeira-arraigned-on-military-charges-ahead-of-march-trial">Pentagon
leaker Teixeira arraigned on military charges ahead of March trial</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HANSCOM AIR FORCE BASE, Massachusetts — Jack Teixeira, a member of
the Massachusetts Air National Guard accused of leaking classified U.S.
national security documents online, was arraigned Friday on charges
brought by the U.S. Air Force that he violated military laws. </p>
<p>During a brief appearance before a military judge at Hanscom Air
Force Base in Massachusetts, 22-year-old Teixeira deferred entering a
plea to charges that he obstructed justice and failed to obey a lawful
order until closer to when his court-martial trial is scheduled to begin
on March 10. </p>
<p>The Air Force announced in May it was pursuing charges that he
violated military laws after Teixeira had already pleaded guilty in
March to separate charges in federal court brought by the U.S. Justice
Department. </p>
<p>Air Force prosecutors say Teixeira ignored an order to cease
accessing classified information unrelated to his duties and obstructed
justice by disposing of an iPad, computer hard drive and iPhone after
the leaks were uncovered and instructing someone to delete online
messages Teixeira had sent. </p>
<p>Military Judge Colonel Vicki Marcus at Friday’s hearing said she
would hold hearings in November and January where she would address any
pre-trial motions from defense lawyers. They have argued the charges
were brought in violation of Teixeira’s constitutional right to not be
prosecuted twice for the same offense. </p>
<p>Teixeira was arrested in April 2013 after authorities said he carried
out one of the most serious U.S. national security breaches in years
while working as a cyber defense operations journeyman, or information
technology support specialist. </p>
<p>Despite being a low-level airman, Teixeira held a top-secret security
clearance, and starting in January 2022 began accessing hundreds of
classified documents related to topics including Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine, according to prosecutors. </p>
<p>Teixeira shared classified information on the messaging app Discord
in private servers — a kind of chat room — while bragging that he had
access to “stuff for Israel, Palestine, Syria, Iran and China,”
according to prosecutors.</p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department plans to seek a sentence of more than 16
years when Teixeira is sentenced on November 12.</p>

A landmark federal staffing mandate has prompted fierce disagreement
between resident advocates and the nursing home industry. Nursing home
owners describe the minimums as extreme, warning they could force some
facilities out of business. Though advocates welcomed the new mandate,
they say it’s more lenient than ideal. We hear about this fierce — and
personal — debate. Plus: a major Social Security number data breach and
parsing more retail sales data.

id="us-colleges-revise-rules-on-free-speech-in-hopes-of-containing-anti-war-demonstrations">US
colleges revise rules on free speech in hopes of containing anti-war
demonstrations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — As students return to colleges across the United States,
administrators are bracing for a resurgence in activism against the war
in Gaza, and some schools are adopting rules to limit the kind of
protests that swept campuses last spring. </p>
<p>While the summer break provided a respite in student demonstrations
against the Israel-Hamas war, it also gave both student protesters and
higher education officials a chance to regroup and strategize for the
fall semester. </p>
<p>The stakes remain high. At Columbia University, President Minouche
Shafik resigned Wednesday after coming under heavy scrutiny for her
handling of the demonstrations at the campus in New York City, where the
wave of pro-Palestinian tent encampments began last spring. </p>
<p>Some of the new rules imposed by universities include banning
encampments, limiting the duration of demonstrations, allowing protests
only in designated spaces and restricting campus access to those with
university identification. Critics say some of the measures will curtail
free speech. </p>
<p>The American Association of University Professors issued a statement
Wednesday condemning “overly restrictive policies” that could discourage
free expression. Many of the new policies require protesters to register
well in advance and strictly limit the locations where gatherings can be
held, as well as setting new limits on the use of amplified sound and
signage.</p>
<p>“Our colleges and universities should encourage, not suppress, open
and vigorous dialogue and debate even on the most deeply held beliefs,”
said the statement, adding that many policies were imposed without
faculty input. </p>
<p>The University of Pennsylvania has outlined new “temporary
guidelines” for student protests that include bans on encampments,
overnight demonstrations, and the use of bullhorns and speakers until
after 5 p.m. on class days. Penn also requires that posters and banners
be removed within two weeks of going up. The university says it remains
committed to freedom of speech and lawful assembly. </p>
<p>At Indiana University, protests after 11 p.m. are forbidden under a
new “expressive activities policy” that took effect August 1. The policy
says “camping” and erecting any type of shelter are prohibited on
campus, and signs cannot be displayed on university property without
prior approval. </p>
<p>The University of South Florida now requires approval for tents,
canopies, banners, signs and amplifiers. The school’s “speech,
expression and assembly” rules stipulate that no “activity,” including
protests or demonstrations, is allowed after 5 p.m. on weekdays or
during weekends and not allowed at all during the last two weeks of a
semester. </p>
<p>A draft document obtained over the summer by the student newspaper at
Harvard University showed the college was considering prohibitions on
overnight camping, chalk messages and unapproved signs. </p>
<p>“I think right now we are seeing a resurgence of repression on
campuses that we haven’t seen since the late 1960s,” said Risa
Lieberwitz, a Cornell University professor of labor and employment law
who serves as general counsel for the AAUP. </p>
<p>Universities say they encourage free speech as long as it doesn’t
interfere with learning, and they insist they are simply updating
existing rules for demonstrations to protect campus safety. </p>
<p>Tensions have run high on college campuses since the October 7 Hamas
terror attack in southern Israel killed 1,200 people, most of them
civilians, and took about 250 hostages. </p>
<p>Many student protesters in the U.S. vow to continue their activism,
which has been fueled by Gaza’s rising death toll, which surpassed
40,000 on Thursday, according to the territory’s Health Ministry. </p>
<p>About 50 Columbia students still face discipline over last spring’s
demonstrations after a mediation process that began earlier in the
summer stalled, according to Mahmoud Khalil, a lead negotiator working
on behalf of Columbia student protesters. He blamed the impasse on
Columbia administrators. </p>
<p>“The university loves to appear that they’re in dialogue with the
students. But these are all fake steps meant to assure the donor
community and their political class,” said Khalil, a graduate student at
Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs. </p>
<p>The university did not immediately respond to a request for comment
Thursday. </p>
<p>The Ivy League school in upper Manhattan was roiled earlier this year
by student demonstrations, culminating in scenes of police officers with
zip ties and riot shields storming a building occupied by
pro-Palestinian protesters. </p>
<p>Similar protests swept college campuses nationwide, with many leading
to violent clashes with police and more than 3,000 arrests. Many of the
students who were arrested during police crackdowns have had their
charges dismissed, but some are still waiting to learn what prosecutors
decide. Many have faced fallout in their academic careers, including
suspensions, withheld diplomas and other forms of discipline. </p>
<p>Shafik was among the university leaders who were called for
questioning before Congress. She was heavily criticized by Republicans
who accused her of not doing enough to combat concerns about
antisemitism on the Columbia campus. </p>
<p>She announced her resignation in an emailed letter to the university
community just weeks before the start of classes on September 3. The
university on Monday began restricting campus access to people with
Columbia IDs and registered guests, saying it wanted to curb “potential
disruptions” as the new semester draws near. </p>
<p>“This period has taken a considerable toll on my family, as it has
for others in the community,” Shafik wrote in her letter. “Over the
summer, I have been able to reflect and have decided that my moving on
at this point would best enable Columbia to traverse the challenges
ahead.” </p>
<p>Pro-Palestinian protesters first set up tent encampments on
Columbia’s campus during Shafik’s congressional testimony in mid-April,
when she denounced antisemitism but faced criticism for how she
responded to faculty and students accused of bias. </p>
<p>The school sent in police to clear the tents the following day, only
for the students to return and inspire a wave of similar protests at
campuses across the country as students called for schools to cut
financial ties with Israel and companies supporting the war. </p>
<p>The campus was mostly quiet this summer, but a conservative news
outlet in June published images of what it said were text messages
exchanged by administrators while attending a May 31 panel discussion
titled “Jewish Life on Campus: Past, Present and Future.” </p>
<p>The officials were removed from their posts, with Shafik saying in a
July 8 letter to the school community that the messages were
unprofessional and “disturbingly touched on ancient antisemitic
tropes.” </p>
<p>Other prominent Ivy League leaders have stepped down in recent
months, largely because of their response to the volatile protests on
campus. </p>
<p>University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill resigned in December
after less than two years on the job. She faced pressure from donors and
criticism over testimony at a congressional hearing where she was unable
to say under repeated questioning that calls on campus for the genocide
of Jews would violate the school’s conduct policy. </p>
<p>And in January, Harvard University President Claudine Gay resigned
amid plagiarism accusations and similar criticism over her testimony
before Congress.</p>

<p>Access to nature isn’t just good for your mental health. A long-term
study suggests that spending time in green spaces, or by water, can help
prevent heart disease. VOA’s Dora Mekouar has more.</p>

<h2 id="windows-can-now-create-2tb-fat32-file-systems">Windows can now
create 2TB FAT32 file systems</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Even though FAT32 supports disk sizes of up to 2TB, and even though
Windows can read FAT32 file systems of up to 2TB, Windows can’t actually
create them. The maximum file system limit Windows can create with FAT32
is 32GB, a limitation that dates back to Windows 95 which has never been
changed. It seems Microsoft is finally changing this with the latest
Insider Preview build of Windows 11, as the format command can now
finally create FAT32 file systems of up to 2TB. When formatting disks
from the command line using the format command, we’ve increased the
FAT32 size limit from 32GB to 2TB. ↫ Amanda Langowski and Brandon
LeBlanc Sadly, this only works through the format command; it’s not yet
reflected in the graphical user interface, which is just so typically
Microsoft. Of course, most of us will be using exFAT at this point for
tasks that require an interoperable file system, but not every device
accepts exFAT properly, and even those that do sometimes have issues
with exFAT that are not present when using FAT32. A more interesting new
addition in this preview build is the Windows Sandbox Client Preview.
This build includes the new Windows Sandbox Client Preview that is now
updated via the Microsoft Store. As part of this preview, we’re
introducing runtime clipboard redirection, audio/video input control,
and the ability to share folders with the host at runtime. You can
access these via the new “…” icon at the upper right on the app.
 Additionally, this preview includes a super early version of command
line support (commands may change over time). You can use ‘wsb.exe
–help’ command for more information. ↫ Amanda Langowski and Brandon
LeBlanc Windows Sandbox is a pretty cool feature that provides a
lightweight desktop environment in which you can run applications
entirely sandboxed, separate from your actual Windows installation.
Changes and files made in the sandbox do not persist, unless the sandbox
is shut down from within the sandbox itself. There’s a whole variety of
uses this could be good for, and having it integrated into Windows is
awesome. Windows Sandbox is available in Windows Pro or Enterprise – not
Home – and is quite easy to use. Open up its window, copy/paste an
executable to the sandbox, and run it inside the sandbox. As said, after
closing the sandbox, all your changes will be lost. That process is
still a bit clunky, but with a bit more work it should be possible for
Microsoft to smooth this out, and, say, add an option in the right-click
menu to just launch any executable in the sandbox that way.</p>

Benchmark Mineral Intelligence expects to see a 350% jump in announced

<h2>
Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?
</h2>
<p>
You should, like my wife and my children, call me Ploum!
</p>
<p>
I’m a 43 years Belgian writer, free software developer and blogger. I
write novels (in French) and teach open source development at École
Polytechnique de Louvain. I’m also a cyclist and a freediver. As a
native French speaker, I apalogise for the English mistakes. Please read
my answer with an atrocious French accent.
</p>
<p>
On the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Dricot">Wikipedia
page about me</a>, the first word next to my name is “blogueur” (blogger
in French). I conclude that my most important activity is being a
blogger. All important things in my life happened, directly or
indirectly, because of my blog.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been hired in most of my professional positions because of my blog.
I’ve met my wife because, after reading a tweet of mine that went viral,
she started to read my blog. I’ve written the first book ever about
Ubuntu because of my blog. I’ve met my current publisher through my
blog. I’ve even started doing long distance bikepacking trips thanks to
Thierry Crouzet, a French writer that I knew for years because we were
reading each other blog.
</p>
<p>
My blog is thus irremediably linked to my identity. I would say that the
only part of my life insulated from my blog is my passion for
freediving. Being a freediver at heart but living far from the sea, I’ve
been practising under water hockey for years. It allows me to spend time
at the bottom of the pool.
</p>
<h2>
What’s the story behind your blog?
</h2>
<p>
I started my first website in 1998, a few weeks after my parents got an
Internet connection. I quickly had multiple websites, one of them being
a kind of online journal for which I was updating a monthly page by
hand. I also started a quite popular generalist wiki which attracted
many external contributors.
</p>
<p>
Around 2002, I declared that blog was just a stupid name for what was a
normal website, that I would never have a blog myself. I’m a visionary,
you see. In 1995, after trying to browse the web for the first time on a
friend’s computer, I’ve said that the web had no future, that it was
only a temporary fad.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, I was very active on many different forums. Remember
forums? I was often repeating myself on them and posting same stuff for
various communities. So, at some point, I wanted to centralise all my
writing in one place. Inspired by the blogger Tristan Nitot, I installed
the Dotclear CMS and opened my blog.
</p>
<p>
On forums, my avatar was often a small Waldo from the “Where is Waldo?”
books. A roommate suggested that if I ever started a blog, it should be
called “Where is Ploum?” So I called my first blog with that name on a
subdomain from one of my websites.
</p>
<p>
There was also a hidden motivation behind the blog. At the time, I was
really involved in a project called “no-name-yet” that would soon become
public. And I wanted a platform to spread the word about that project.
That “no-name-yet” was later released under the name “Ubuntu”. So it
happens that my blog has the exact same age as Ubuntu and shares a lot
of its history.
</p>
<p>
Writing on my blog quickly became a lifestyle. The success of my blog
also took me by surprise: people I didn’t know were reading me,
commenting, contacting me, inviting me to conferences. For 4 years, I
used Dotclear. As a side gig, I started a small business hosting
people’s blogs on a Dotclear version 2 platform but kept Dotclear
version 1 for my own blog.
</p>
<p>
In 2008, I eventually migrated to Wordpress because it was the de facto
standard in the industry. I’ve always been self-hosted and made sure to
import all my old blog posts. Beside a theme change, the migration was
totally transparent for my readers. Even URLs were kept because cool
URLs never change.
</p>
<p>
I started to hate Wordpress more every year but, despite multiple
attempts, I could not get rid of it. In 2020, I encountered the Gemini
protocol and started a gemlog (a blog on Gemini), completely separated
from my blog. It started to grow and I wanted to integrate my gemlog
posts into my historical blog (that I was still using).
</p>
<p>
In 2022, I had a “Eureka” moment. Instead of integrating my gemlog into
my wordpress blog, I would do the opposite and import all my historical
blog posts into my gemlog. Then, I would make an HTML version of my
gemlog.
</p>
<p>
I called that
“<a href="https://ploum.net/2022-12-04-fin-du-blog-et-derniere-version.html">the
last version of ploum.net</a>” because I’m not dependent anymore on any
external tools. Everything is now done through a handmade python script.
All I have to do is to write text files in the Gemtext format. It cannot
be simpler.
</p>
<h2>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?
</h2>
<p>
Firstly, I never force myself to write or publish. I don’t have any
schedule or any mandatory thing to do.
</p>
<p>
Every single post is there because I wanted to write it and publish it.
I’ve been through many iterations of my creative process, using stuff
like Evernote or other. I threw it all away.
</p>
<p>
I simply have an “inbox” folder where there are drafts in gemtext
format. They could linger there for months or years. Sometimes, they are
published one hour after starting them. There’s no rule.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been greatly influenced by Cory Doctorow and his memex method. In
my inbox, I keep a “today.gmi” file in which I write small reflections
and links to interesting articles. When the file is bigger than 1000
words, I try to give it a direction, I reorder the nuggets and publish
it without thinking too much about it.
</p>
<p>
As a consequence, my blog is a mix of focused posts that took a long
time to write, focused posts that were written in a whim and posts
containing random thoughts and links. I let you try to guess in which
category is a given post.
</p>
<p>
The gemtext format had a great influence on my process. It doesn’t allow
inline links and forces a link to be alone on its own line. This
constraint was a liberating tool. Instead of putting links everywhere in
my posts, I started to really think about each link. A link can only be
added if it is clear why it is there and if it is not interrupting too
much the reading flow. Which means that it should add real value for the
reader. I feel my writing greatly improved because of this. I can write
without thinking in HTML, without thinking about the links. Every post
is a standalone with optional links for readers who want to investigate
more the subject.
</p>
<p>
I must add that I write my own journal on a mechanical typewriter.
Sometimes, I realise that an entry could be made public so I copy it to
a file by hand (I’ve tried OCR but without much success. It is easier to
copy everything by hand as it allows me to make corrections).
</p>
<p>
One day, I will write a whole book about my typewriter creative process.
</p>
<h2>
Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the
physical space influences your creativity?
</h2>
<p>
Yes, I do believe that the body associate a physical space with a given
activity. It is a learned habit. The bad news is that my body learned
that my home office is the place to answer emails, read stuff and do
administrative work.
</p>
<p>
When I need to work on a new book, I often need to walk away. I would
take my typewriter in a hotel room or a cabin in the wood and spend
multiple days disconnected to « just write ».
</p>
<p>
I also hate every single noise and don’t listen to music during the
creative phase. But I may listen to loud metal, punk rock or classic
music during all the “boring” steps: proofreading, general corrections,
spelling, etc.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully, writing blog posts is now part of my daily automatic tasks so
I can do it in my home office.
</p>
<p>
The editor is also important. I’ve been using Gedit, Pyroom, Ulysses,
Zettlr. But, a few years ago, I decided to really improve my Vim skills
and I’m now doing everything in Vim without any plugins nor special
configuration. Vim and my Bépo keyboard are unbeatable power tools. I
see my writing on the screen before thinking of it.
</p>
<h2>
A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech
stack?
</h2>
<p>
I’ve told above the history of my blogs. The current setup is quite
interesting.
</p>
<p>
I write gemtext files and give them a name that starts with the date
such as “2024-06-25-blogpost.gmi”. When this is done, I have a simple
python script that does two things: first it creates an index.gmi file
with a list of all blog posts in anti-chronological order. This is the
gemini capsule. Then, the python file convert all the gemtext into html,
creating the website itself.
</p>
<p>
There are some subtleties: the script also handle the atom feed, the
fact that I write in French and English (thus generating two indexes)
and send an email version for my mailing-list subscribers. But
everything is done by one python file without any dependency. It is
extremely simple.
</p>
<p>
The HTML template itself has around 40 lines of CSS and nothing else.
Very clean, very efficient, very fast to load even on bad connections.
</p>
<p>
Currently, I host it on Sourcehut. It allows me to simply do a “git
push” and have the HTML version generated on the server. Sourcehut is
also, to my knowledge, one of the only Gemini hosting providers.
</p>
<p>
But if I had to move, it would be only a matter of changing my git
remote.
</p>
<p>
I don’t need to backup anything from the server side: my blog and all
its history are now in a git repository.
</p>
<p>
It should be highlighted than I’m a command-line junkie. So I do
everything in Vim and even developed a command-line offline-first
browser to read Gemini, RSS and other blogs. It is called
<a href="https://sr.ht/~lioploum/offpunk/">Offpunk </a>.
</p>
<p>
So, yeah, my screen is fully black with tiled terminals. I live with
Neovim, Offpunk, Neomutt and a couple of bash/python scripts. This is so
comfy that I’m frustrated each time I need to open Firefox or any other
GUI application.
</p>
<h2>
Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do
anything differently?
</h2>
<p>
My blog is exactly where I want it to be. If I had to start again, I
would simply do it like I did in 2022. I was quick to remove any form of
comments from my blog and, later, any kind of statistics. As far as I
know, I’m one of the few strong advocates for the complete removal of
statistics/analytic/tracking tools. It’s not ethical to spy on users but
it is also completely counterproductive. Statistics on websites are a
brainworm. People are obsessed by it and it makes them write dumb stuff
in order to increase a dumb counter. Getting rid of any
audience-measuring tool is one of the best things I did in 2013.
</p>
<p>
There’s another thing I want to say to past me if time travel is ever
invented: don’t fall into the social networks trap!
</p>
<p>
I’ve spent way too many time chasing followers on Twitter, Facebook,
Medium and Google+. I’ve written many interesting stuff on those
platforms, thinking they were not “interesting enough” for my blog. I
regret all I’ve written on proprietary platforms. My blog is my personal
history and I plan to keep it until I die.
</p>
<p>
I’ve completely deleted all my social network accounts and never felt so
free. Ironically, the less I was using social networks, the more readers
I had on my blog. Social networks don’t bring you an audience. This is a
lie! Social networks distract you from your real work and prevent your
audience from reaching you. That’s their whole business! I know how
frightening it is to delete permanently an account with thousands of
followers. But this number is also a lie.
</p>
<p>
Removing permanently those accounts (and not merely “deactivating them”,
as I’ve done multiple times before) changed my life and my blog.
</p>
<p>
The only account I still have is a Mastodon account. That I access
through the command-line “toot”. You can find me there if you really
like but I don’t encourage you to follow me. Use RSS!
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://mamot.fr/@ploum">https://mamot.fr/<span
class="citation" data-cites="ploum">@ploum</span></a> - <span
class="citation" data-cites="ploum">@ploum</span><span class="citation"
data-cites="mamot.fr">@mamot.fr</span>
</p>
<p>
I don’t use Mastodon to reach an audience but only to communicate with
interesting people. I hope Mastodon will one day hide the followers
counter so we stop being obsessed with those silly numbers.
</p>
<h2>
Financial question since the Web is obsessed with money: how much does
it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost, or does it generate some
revenue? And what’s your position on people monetising personal blogs?
</h2>
<p>
In 2006, I experimented with advertising on my blog, earning something
between 35€ and 100€ every month (through Google).
</p>
<p>
I quickly realised the moral implications of that money and now consider
that advertising is, by essence, a scam. Its goal is to make us consume
stuff we don’t need and, in the process, make people dishonest. If you
earn money through advertising, you are, by definition, dishonest. You
cannot be honest as the whole definition of advertising is paying you to
be dishonest. All in the name of destroying our natural resources as
fast as possible.
</p>
<p>
Later, I was one of the first French bloggers to popularise the concept
of “prix libre” (free price in French), asking my readers to make free
donations. I managed to earn a regular income between 200€-300€ per
month, mainly on the Flattr platform but also through direct donations.
This was well before Patreon and similar platforms.
</p>
<p>
This experience was awesome. I was paid but I also received pictures,
hand-written letters of support, nice messages. People really understood
that it was not about money only, it was about supporting my work. I can
never thank enough those who supported me.
</p>
<p>
With the advent of platforms like Patreon, the “free price” concept
become a bit too popular for my taste. Everybody was asking for money.
Also, I started to publish books. Now, I ask people that want to support
me to simply buy my books. It’s the best way to support me but to also
support my publisher (who took the risk of putting most of his catalogue
into the Creative Commons license) and to support small bookstore.
</p>
<p>
Running the blog itself is cheap. 10€/year for a domain. To support the
project, I decided to pay the maximum tier for Sourcehut, which is
100€/year. All in all, my blog costs me less than 10€ per month.
</p>
<p>
In 20 years, I’ve published ±900 blog posts. With all the pictures, this
amount to less than 150Mo. If it was really needed, it could probably be
hosted for next to nothing. Blogging is really cheap.
</p>
<h2>
Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out?
And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?
</h2>
<p>
I read many blogs and gemlogs. The whole Gemini community is really
interesting as it reminds me of the blogosphere I was reading in
2003-2004.
</p>
<p>
Maybe the most interesting are people I’m still reading after all those
years, people that have a great influence on how I blog.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.standblog.org/blog/">Tristan Nitot</a> (in French)
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://tcrouzet.com/">Thierry Crouzet</a> (in French)
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://pluralistic.net/">Cory Doctorow</a> (in English)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I’m still reading and was also influenced a lot by Low-Tech Magazine:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/">Low-Tech Magazine</a> (in
English)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For those that would like to try discovering Gemini and its gemlogs, I
recommend starting with those two aggregators:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Antenna - gemini://warmedal.se/~antenna/
</li>
<li>
Cosmos - gemini://skyjake.fi/~Cosmos/recent.gmi
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are many gemlogs I like but you should probably follow Solderpunk
as he’s the creator of the Gemini protocol.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Solderpunk’s gemlog -
gemini://zaibatsu.circumlunar.space/~solderpunk/gemlog/
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?
</h2>
<p>
I think I’ve covered it all about myself in all the previous questions.
I’m currently working on several novels and one book about the history
of computer science.
</p>
<p>
As that last one is in English and as we discuss translating my novels
with my publisher, I find myself increasingly wanting to work with a
literary agent. If you happen to know one, I would be happy to be put in
touch.
</p>
<p>
And to all blog readers across the world: use RSS readers! Those are
awesome and allows you to quickly subscribe/unsubscribe at your own
pace.

<p class="drop-caps">
When Donald Trump speaks at length — at a rally, at a press conference,
or in an interview — subsequent news reports often clean up his remarks
through well-placed ellipses and generous paraphrases, imposing a
coherence nowhere to be found in the original. So it was with
<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/elon-musk-and-donald-trump-interview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>his
recent conversation</u></a> with Elon Musk on X, during which the two
spent a fair amount of time laying out their deep thoughts on climate
change, to the horror of many observers. (Bill McKibben
<a href="https://billmckibben.substack.com/p/the-dumbest-climate-conversation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>called
it</u></a> “The dumbest climate conversation of all time.”)
</p>
<p>
At the risk of being too kind to both men, there was a silver lining to
be found in their tête-à-tête, even if its purpose was to help get Trump
back in the White House. For all he has devolved into a right-wing
internet troll, Musk might convince Trump — and the millions who follow
them both — to shift their perspective on climate change a critical few
degrees in a useful direction.
</p>
<p>
That’s not to say the Trump-Musk confab wasn’t uncommonly stupid,
because it was. In addition to a litany of false statements and odd non
sequiturs, Trump was illogically dismissive of climate concerns: “The
biggest threat is not global warming, where the ocean’s going to rise
one-eighth of an inch over the next 400 years and you’ll have more
oceanfront property.” He also lamented the imaginary fact that “you have
farmers that are not allowed to farm anymore and have to get rid of
their cattle,” an area apparently of deep concern to him; elsewhere he
has
<a href="https://x.com/SamJefferson__/status/1816257343446765933" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>claimed</u></a>
that Kamala Harris “wants to pass laws to outlaw red meat to stop
climate change.” Neither of these things is remotely true (though
farmers forced to sell their cattle due to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/is-extreme-weather-climate-change#drought" target="_self"><u>drought</u></a>
are now eligible for
<a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/farmers-and-ranchers-hit-hard-by-drought-may-be-eligible-for-extension-of-tax-relief" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>extra
tax relief</u></a> as of 2022).
</p>
<p>
The Tesla chief offered his own brand of misinformation; like many a
semi-informed autodidact, he often says things that are true in some
sense but deeply misleading. Talking about carbon in the atmosphere, he
told Trump, “Eventually, it actually simply gets uncomfortable to
breathe. People don’t realize this. If you go past 1,000 parts per
million of CO2, you start getting headaches and nausea. And so we’re now
in the sort of 400 range … we still have quite a bit of time. We don’t
need to rush.” While it’s true that it would be difficult to breathe at
a CO2 concentration of 1,000 parts per million, the danger of rising
carbon emissions isn’t that someday we might all choke to death; as
climate scientist Michael Mann
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/13/trump-musk-x-climate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a>
in response, by the time we reach that point the myriad effects of
climate change “will be so devastating as to have already caused
societal collapse.”
</p>
<p>
On the whole, the interview showed Musk praising Trump and nodding along
with some of the former president’s loopier statements, but eventually
attempting to convince him that carbon emissions can be lowered
painlessly (albeit in ways that would just happen to make Musk even
richer). “People can still have a steak and they can still drive
gasoline cars, and it’s okay,” he reassured Trump. “When you look at our
cars, we don’t believe that environmentalism, that caring about the
environment should mean that you have to suffer. So we make sure that
our cars are beautiful, that they drive well, that they’re fast, they’re
sexy. They’re cool,” Musk said, concluding that “I’m a big fan of, let’s
have an inspiring future and let’s work towards a better future.”
</p>
<p>
That has always been Musk’s position, and while one certainly might
disagree with parts of his argument (or his
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/h4ZoGASM8bI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>prior
claim</u></a> that “I’ve done more for the environment than any single
human on Earth”), if the goal were to talk Trump into lessening his
opposition to any and all efforts to mitigate climate change, that might
be the only way to do it. Even in the course of the conversation one
could see Trump coming around, at least here and there. “I’m sort of
waiting for you to come up with solar panels on the roofs of your cars,”
he told Musk. “I’m sure you’ll be the first, but it would seem that a
solar panel on the roofs, on flat surfaces, on certain surfaces might be
good, at least in certain areas of the country or the world where you
have the sun.” There are already
<a href="https://www.edmunds.com/electric-car/articles/electric-cars-with-solar-panels.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
number of cars</u></a> with solar panels on their roofs — no one is
waiting for Musk to devise one — but the fact of Trump speaking
positively about any kind of solar power is more significant than
whether he is aware of the latest technology.
</p>
<p>
For the moment, Trump’s bromance with Musk — or marriage of convenience
— has even led the former president to moderate his
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-ev-pivot-elon-musk" target="_self"><u>rhetoric
on electric vehicles</u></a>, which he has often condemned in the past.
“I’m constantly talking about electric vehicles but I don’t mean I’m
against them. I’m totally for them,”
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/23/climate/trump-electric-vehicles-musk.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he
said</u></a> at a rally in July. “I’ve driven them and they are
incredible, but they’re not for everybody.”
</p>
<p>
None of this is to say that Trump has anything but a deeply reactionary
climate agenda. The oil magnates
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/13/oil-donors-trump-pac-harold-hamm-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pouring
money</u></a> into his campaign are not being fooled about the return
they can expect on their investment. The Republican nominee himself may
have few fixed ideas about climate, but the people he appoints to
another administration and the Republicans in Congress that support him
will be committed to rolling back President Biden’s climate programs and
finding new ways to promote fossil fuels and undermine the policy
changes that are beginning to reduce emissions.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, rhetoric does matter, and Trump doesn’t have to become a
climate hawk to begin influencing his admirers to see the issue in a
slightly different way. Even if all it means is that they become a
little more open to looking at climate mitigation as not a dire threat
to their way of life, but rather something that won’t make much of
difference to them one way or the other — in other words, if they move
from being hostile to climate efforts to being simply indifferent — that
would be a significant change.
</p>
<p>
The theory behind favoring
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/inflation-reduction-act-carrots-sticks" target="_self"><u>carrots
over sticks</u></a> in climate policy — more subsidies, fewer mandates —
is in part that diffusing opposition is an important component of policy
success. If Elon Musk encourages Trump to start talking about climate in
ways that make addressing the problem sound less threatening to his
supporters, it couldn’t hurt.

US look to joint production of hypersonic missile, US lawmaker says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SYDNEY — Joint production of hypersonic missiles by Australia and the
United States could reduce strain on the U.S. defense industrial base
and boost deterrence in the Indo-Pacific region, U.S. Republican
lawmaker Michael McCaul said in Sydney on Friday.</p>
<p>In an interview, the chair of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs
Committee said the Australian manufacture of the cutting-edge weapons
provided an example of how streamlined licensing of sensitive U.S.
defense technology, and license exemptions on 70% of defense exports to
Australia from September 1, would help the U.S. compete with China in
developing advanced weapons.</p>
<p>Hypersonic missiles, which travel in the upper atmosphere more than
five times faster than sound, were tested by China in 2021, prompting a
technology race with the United States. Their recent use by Russia in
the Ukraine war, sparked concern among members of NATO.</p>
<p>A Chinese hypersonic weapon “could hit Australia in a matter of
minutes and Australia cannot stop that right now. So we need to catch up
to that,” McCaul said.</p>
<p>“I was at a hypersonic company just yesterday and we want to move
towards co-production,” he added.</p>
<p>“It is already starting and that is the exciting thing and it will
help relieve the stress that we see on the defense industrial base,” he
added.</p>
<p>Australia is testing a Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (HACM) with
the United States, which it will consider as its first such weapon for
fighter jets, the defense and foreign ministers of the two countries
said after talks last week.</p>
<p>McCaul said his visit focused on the AUKUS partnership with the
United States and Britain to transfer nuclear-powered submarines to
Australia, as well as develop other advanced defense technologies.</p>
<p>The AUKUS alliance was an example of a U.S. ally spending more on its
own defense, he said, when asked if a reelected Donald Trump would
continue to back a growing U.S. defense posture in Australia, and the
sale of U.S. nuclear submarines next decade.</p>
<p>AUKUS talks had started under the Republican Trump presidency, he
added.</p>
<p>“I think there will be strong support for it,” he said.</p>
<p>Rotations of U.S. nuclear submarines through Australia under AUKUS
are a deterrent factor in the region, where the Philippines is under
pressure from China in the South China Sea, he said, after visiting the
Philippines.</p>
<p>“Chairman Xi, I think, fears this alliance more than anything else
because he knows what it means - it means that nuclear submarines will
be rotating, but also these innovative technologies that we have,” he
added, in a reference to Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>In Beijing this week, the Chinese foreign ministry said AUKUS “harms
efforts” to keep the region peaceful and secure and exacerbates the arms
race.</p>

<h2 id="hurricane-ernesto-moves-toward-bermuda">Hurricane Ernesto moves
toward Bermuda</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — U.S. forecasters said Hurricane Ernesto
remained a category 2 storm Friday as it churns in the Atlantic Ocean on
a path toward the island of Bermuda, where it is predicted to bring high
winds, heavy rain and strong surf.</p>
<p>At last report, Ernesto was about 415 kilometers (258 miles)
south-southwest of Bermuda and was moving to the north-northeast at 20
kph (13 mph). It has maximum sustained winds of 155 kph (about 100
mph).</p>
<p>A hurricane warning remains in effect for Bermuda, where Ernesto is
expected to produce 15 to 30 centimeters (up to 12 inches) of rain with
isolated maximum amounts up 38 centimeters (15 inches). Forecasters said
this could result in considerable life-threatening flash flooding.</p>
<p>Officials in the British territory announced Thursday they would
suspend public transportation and close the airport by Friday night.
National Security Minister Michael Weeks had urged people to complete
their hurricane preparations by Thursday.</p>
<p>While forecasters initially predicted Ernesto would continue to
strengthen and possibly become a major storm — a Category 3 hurricane or
stronger — by the time it reached Bermuda, they now say that
strengthening seemingly halted overnight, although it has not lost its
punch.</p>
<p>Ernesto was expected to strengthen further Friday before it passes
near or over Bermuda sometime Saturday.</p>
<p>Forecasters said the size is generally larger than their previous
forecast, with hurricane-force winds extending outward up to 110
kilometers (68 miles) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds
extending outward up to 425 kilometers (265 miles), so the
life-threatening hazards from Ernesto are unchanged.</p>
<p>Even though Ernesto is expected to remain well off the U.S. East
Coast, forecasters said the storm is expected to generate swells along
the shoreline into the weekend. The swells could pose a significant risk
of life-threatening surf and rip currents.</p>
<p>High surf and rip currents are also possible in the northern
Caribbean along the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic,
Turks and Caicos, and the Bahamas </p>
<p>during the next few days.</p>
<p>Ernesto brought heavy wind and rain to the northern Caribbean as it
moved through Wednesday. It knocked out power, downed trees and forced
schools and businesses to close in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto
Rico, where many of the island’s businesses and homes lost power.</p>
<p>Ernesto is the fifth named storm and the third hurricane of this
year’s Atlantic hurricane season.</p>
<p>Some information for this report was provided by The Associated
Press.</p>

killing it, blah blah blah.

It’s
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/11/bullshit2.m4a">bullshit</a>. In
the next few months Twitter is going to morph into the political system
that Barack Obama could have and should have built.
</p>
<p>
It turns out creating a president of the United States is worth a lot of
money. Trump is inept at squeezing the money out of it, he’s a loudmouth
who proved one thing, Twitter is all you needed in 2016 to get elected
president. That’s going to change, as competition shows up (Zuckerberg,
for example, with Threads).
</p>
<p>
They know, even if you don’t – that it can be very profitable to own the
presidency.
</p>
<p>
If Trump loses, Musk won’t get it on this round, but eventually he will
own a big piece of the president, and then he will move his deals with
SpaceX and Tesla up a notch.

Listen to the

remarks on Venezuela prompt questions over US policy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>white house — President Joe Biden said Thursday he supports new
elections in Venezuela, giving a VOA reporter a two-word response — “I
do” — when asked “do you support new elections in Venezuela?”</p>
<p>Brazil’s leader had proposed a rerun of the July 28 election, which
the White House says opposition challenger Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia won.
Protests have bubbled up in the wake of President Nicolas Maduro’s
victory claim, and the leader of the opposition is calling for massive
protests this Saturday.  </p>
<p>But the administration told VOA hours later that Biden understood
VOA’s question differently, leaving it unclear whether this represents a
shift in Washington’s position on Venezuela’s political crisis.  </p>
<p>A National Security Council spokesperson reiterated the
administration’s stance, telling VOA in an email that Biden “was
speaking to the absurdity of Maduro and his representatives not coming
clean about the July 28 elections.” </p>
<p>“It is abundantly clear to the majority of the Venezuelan people, the
United States, and a growing number of countries that Edmundo Gonzalez
Urrutia won the most votes on July 28. The United States again calls for
the will of the Venezuelan people to be respected and for discussions to
begin on a transition back to democratic norms.” </p>
<p>The spokesperson did not say definitively where Biden stands on
whether the election should be repeated.  </p>
<p>Earlier Thursday, an NSC spokesperson told VOA that the Biden
administration is “considering a range of options to incentivize and
pressure Maduro to recognize the election results and will continue to
do so.” </p>
<p>White House seeks vote data</p>
<p>Separately, White House National Security Communications Adviser John
Kirby told reporters: “We want to see the actual vote tallies, the data,
and we haven’t seen that yet. So, we still need to see that.” </p>
<p>Kirby also added, “it is not true that there’s been amnesty offered
to Mr. Maduro” as part of any deal to resolve the crisis.  </p>
<p>Shortly after the election, Maduro began cracking down on political
opponents, prompting rights groups to sound the alarm.</p>
<p>Strained ties </p>
<p>Washington has long had strained ties with Caracas, Venezuela, caused
by ideological differences with the left-leaning country, doubts about
the validity of previous elections, U.S. sanctions on officials over
human rights abuses, and crippling American economic sanctions on the
oil-rich nation. </p>
<p>Venezuela’s situation has led to a northward exodus of millions of
Venezuelans, leaving both American authorities and those migrants in a
delicate position.</p>

applauds Sudan’s decision to open Adre border crossing with Chad</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States welcomed Thursday’s announcement by
Sudan’s sovereign council to allow the use of the Adre border crossing
with Chad for three months, while continuing efforts to bring both sides
of Sudan’s warring military factions to the negotiating table.</p>
<p>The opening of the Adre border crossing is a long-awaited move by aid
organizations aiming to deliver humanitarian assistance to
famine-threatened areas of the Darfur region. The war-torn country faces
one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.</p>
<p>We “welcome the news as it relates to this border crossing with
Chad,” State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told VOA during
a briefing on Thursday. “We are continuing to call on the SAF [Sudanese
Armed Forces] and RSF [Rapid Support Forces] to facilitate unrestricted
humanitarian access through any and all available channels.”</p>
<p>The United States has invited leaders from both warring factions to
Geneva, Switzerland, for talks aimed at negotiating a potential
cease-fire to end the 16-month civil war.</p>
<p>The SAF had already rejected the talks several days earlier, while
the RSF delegation, though in Switzerland, was absent from Wednesday’s
open session.</p>
<p>“We’re still very focused on getting both sides in Sudan back to the
table and to come to meaningful agreements about laying their arms down
and doing the right thing for the people of Sudan,” White House national
security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Thursday.</p>
<p>“You certainly need both military actors to be part of” the
conversation on a cessation of violence, Patel told reporters on
Thursday.</p>
<p>Diplomats from the African Union, Egypt, Saudia Arabia, Switzerland,
the United Arab Emirates and the United Nations were at the
U.S.-mediated talks, which opened on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“Day 2 of our diplomatic talks on Sudan is under way. We continue our
relentless work with international partners to save lives and ensure we
achieve tangible results that build upon the Jeddah Process and
implement the Jeddah Declaration,” U.S. Special Envoy for Sudan Tom
Perriello wrote on X.</p>
<p>The Jeddah Declaration, reached in May 2023, calls for full aid
access by land and air to all populations regardless of who controls the
area.</p>
<p>More than a year of fighting between SAF and RSF troops has displaced
nearly 10 million people across the greater Horn of Africa country and
left 26 million facing crisis-level hunger.  </p>
<p>“The medical system in Sudan is at a breaking point. Hospitals
designed to serve tens of thousands are overwhelmed with over half a
million displaced people, while the international community’s pledged
aid remains largely undelivered,” Adil Al-Mahi, humanitarian
organization MedGlobal’s country director in Sudan, told VOA on
Thursday.</p>
<p>He added that the last operational hospital in El Fasher may be
forced to close due to intense shelling. El Fasher, the capital of North
Darfur, is the battleground for intense conflict between the SAF and
RSF.</p>
<p>“The Saudi Hospital, the last public hospital in North Darfur, is
barely functioning after continued bombardments. With each attack, it
becomes increasingly clear that there is no regard for the protection of
health facilities or the civilians within them. The international
community must urgently intervene to protect these vital lifelines
before it’s too late,” Al-Mahi said.</p>

Are Spending More to Capture Carbon Than to Capture Wind</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-15, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzM3MDc3Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMDI2OTcwM30.TyfsiERDrv3yLCTcRn382lJ0hBvTonACEpjRrEE-97U/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
There’s a lot of money in carbon management. Like, a <em>lot</em>.
Investment in the full suite of technologies designed to capture, store,
and transport carbon has skyrocketed this year, according to
<a href="https://www.cleaninvestmentmonitor.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>data</u></a>
from Rhodium Group and Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Clean
Investment Monitor.
</p>
<p>
Overall investment in clean energy technology — which includes
manufacturing of batteries, vehicles, and solar panels, clean energy
generation, and retail products like heat pumps — was $284 billion in
the last year, with $76 billion in the second quarter of this year
alone, a record figure.
</p>
<p>
The fastest growth came from “emerging climate technologies,” which
includes carbon management, which had $3 billion in investment in the
second quarter — more than the $1.7 billion invested in wind generation.
Compare that to the same time last year, when wind investment stood at
$2.6 billion and carbon management investment was just under half a
billion dollars. (Solar generation, meanwhile, had $9.3 billion in
investment in the second quarter of this year, while storage saw $5.4
billion poured in.)
</p>
<p>
What changed?
</p>
<p>
Basically, wind — and its tax incentives — are hardly new to the U.S.
economy, and while the Inflation Reduction Act expanded and extended
those tax incentives, it was building on an existing policy. And in that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/ira-anniversary-labor" target="_blank">post-IRA
period up to today</a> (almost exactly two years from the day the law
was signed), wind, which requires long construction periods and
substantial upfront spending, has been hampered by
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/fed-interest-rate-renewables" target="_blank">high
interest rates</a>. That’s true for solar, too, although to a lesser
extent, explained Trevor Houser, a parter at the Rhodium Group, as wind
projects take more time to build and so rely more on borrowed money.
</p>
<p>
With carbon management, on the other hand, the IRA was a complete
gamechanger,
<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11455" target="_blank"><u>hugely
boosting</u></a> the 45Q tax credit for carbon sequestered underground
to as much as $85 per metric ton for capturing emissions where they
happen, and then to as high $180 per metric ton for direct air capture.
</p>
<p>
“The majority of the growth that we’re seeing right now is due to that
incentive,” Houser told me, as the tax credits have opened up the field
to something beyond just using carbon for
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/fecm/enhanced-oil-recovery" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>literal
oil drilling</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Jack Andreasen, who runs carbon management policy at Breakthrough
Energy, told me basically the same thing. “The boom in carbon management
is driven nearly entirely by the support made available in the
[Bipartisan Infrastructure Law] and IRA,” he said.
</p>
<p>
That scale of investment will be necessary to build out any reasonably
sized carbon management sector, Andreasen told me. Building out new
industrial and generation facilities equipped with carbon capture will
be extremely capital-intensive, as will retrofitting existing
facilities.
</p>
<p>
“That is the brilliance and importance of the federal funding — there is
money for new builds <em>and</em> for retrofits. And both of these will
be key in our net-zero future,” Andreasen said.<del></del>
</p>
<p>
But while carbon management does have a fair amount of bipartisan
political support, as with any large project, the necessary
infrastructure — industrial facilities and especially pipelines —
<a href="https://www.agriculture.com/broad-array-of-groups-object-to-summit-pipeline-permit-in-iowa-8679213" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>can
attract local opposition</u></a>. The nearly 700-mile-long planned
Summit pipeline, which is supposed to link dozens of ethanol plants to a
<a href="https://summitcarbonsolutions.com/project-footprint/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>carbon
sequestration site in North Dakota</u></a>, has been strenuously opposed
by
<a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2024/07/12/pipeline-opponents-are-poised-for-summit-permit-challenges/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>environmental
groups and landowners in Iowa</u></a>, uniting progressives with a group
of Republican lawmakers against the state’s powerbrokers and much of its
agribusinesses interests.
</p>
<p>
“Carbon management does face similar siting and permitting barriers,
particularly around pipelines,” to renewables like wind, Houser told me.
And while that could potentially slow down development, “it’s starting
from a lower base — you can get pretty rapid growth if you’re starting
from zero.”

<h2 id="cartridge-software-for-the-psion-series-3">Cartridge software
for the Psion Series 3</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Similar to less popular handheld of the era, the Gameboy, the Psion
used a proprietary cartridge format for distributing commercial
software. Psion sold blank cartridges, flashing hardware and duplicators
to software houses, as well as releasing a number of titles under their
own license. There’s a wide range of commercial software available for
the Series 3 family, and only some of it was ported to the Series 5 (I
really wish Scrabble had been released on Series 5). The range of
software available was significant. Cartridges unlocked the Psion 3’s
ability to play a large number of games, provide phrase book translation
to a number of languages (Berliz Interpreter), route plan your car
journeys (Microsoft Autoroute), look up the best wines for this year
(Hugh Johnson’s Wine Guide) or build your organisation chart Purple
Software’s OrgChart. ↫ Kian Ryan I have a Psion 3, but the only
cartridges I have are empty ones you can use for personal storage. I’ve
always wanted to buy a selection of cartridges on eBay, but sadly, my
Psion 3 died due to me forgetting to remove the batteries when
immigrating to Sweden, something I only discovered like five years
later. I was smart enough to remove all batteries from every single
device in my massive collection, but I guess the Psion 3 slipped through
my fingers. Anyway, this article is a great look at some of the
cartridges that existed for the Psion 3, and it’s really making me want
to replace my broken Psion 3 and buy one that comes with a set of
cartridges. There’s something really attractive about how the Psion 3’s
EPOC operating system worked, and the third party programs look like so
much fun to explore and use.</p>

<h2 id="why-the-world-needs-yet-another-methane-satellite">Why the World
Needs Yet Another Methane Satellite</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-15, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/methanesat-edf-satellite-gosat" target="_self"><u>Yet
another</u></a> methane satellite is launching into orbit Friday, as
early as 11:19 a.m. Pacific time, on a SpaceX rocket. Developed by a
coalition of public and private partners and led by the nonprofit Carbon
Mapper, its precision imaging helps fill a gap in the methane detection
universe and complements the abilities of MethaneSAT, the Environmental
Defense Fund-developed, Google-backed satellite launched back in March.
</p>
<p>
Riley Duren, CEO of Carbon Mapper, likens his company’s satellite to a
telephoto lens, saying it “has a resolution that’s about 10 times higher
than the MethaneSAT instrument” — although the tradeoff is that the
field of view is about 10 times smaller. The ultimate goal is to
identify “super-emitters” of methane and carbon dioxide at the facility
level. So while MethaneSAT can detect the total emissions emanating from
a particular basin, state, or country, Carbon Mapper can zoom in to
figure out what’s going on within 50 meters of accuracy so that
operators and regulators can be notified.
</p>
<p>
Both companies use an imaging technology known as spectroscopy, which
involves splitting the light reflected by Earth’s surface into its
constituent wavelengths. Methane and carbon dioxide each have their own
spectroscopic signature. “It’s not unlike being able to perceive the
distinction in human fingerprints,” Duren told me.
</p>
<p>
The Carbon Mapper Coalition satellite, called Tanager-1, came from a
partnership between Planet Labs, which developed the satellite, and
NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which developed the particular
spectrometer used onboard. Duren helped create the tech during his
nearly 28-year career at JPL, where his research revealed the
<a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/a-third-of-california-methane-traced-to-a-few-super-emitters" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>outsized
importance of super-emitters</u></a>. That helped inspire Duren to found
Carbon Mapper in 2020, though until now the organization has mostly done
suborbital aerial surveys to track methane and carbon dioxide emissions.
</p>
<p>
Promisingly, he’s found that distributing his team’s findings often
leads to a rapid response. “When we’ve shared our data with oil and gas
companies, landfill operators, and regulators, what they tell us is
nearly half of the emissions that we’re reporting were previously
unknown,” Duren told me. “And in many cases, they can quickly repair
them.”
</p>
<p>
The data from these surveys is publicly accessible on the
<a href="https://data.carbonmapper.org/#1.28/30.8/50.5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Carbon
Mapper data portal</u></a>, and the data from Tanager-1 will be
published there as well. In addition to Planet Labs and JPL, other
coalition partners include the California Air Resources Board,
University of Arizona, Arizona State University, and RMI. To date,
Carbon Mapper has raised over $130 million in philanthropic funding,
from donors including the High Tide Foundation, Bloomberg
Philanthropies, and the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the
Environment.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Carbon Mapper aims to launch a constellation of more than 10
satellites, which together will detect and track up to 90% of
high-emitting methane sources with near-daily frequency. But this will
require funding beyond what the philanthropic sector is likely to pony
up.
</p>
<p>
“Scaling up this to the full constellation and sustaining it will hinge
on the ability of governments and the private sector to pay for data,”
Duren told me. (MethaneSAT is also philanthropically supported.) “We’re
hopeful that as these programs scale up and we demonstrate their utility
and the regulators depend on them, that we’ll see governments begin to
match what philanthropy has started,” Durian said.

id="matthew-perrys-assistant-among-5-people-charged-in-friends-stars-death">Matthew
Perry’s assistant among 5 people charged in ‘Friends’ star’s death</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>los angeles — A prosecutor says five people have been charged in
connection with Matthew Perry’s death from a ketamine overdose last
year, including the actor’s assistant and two doctors.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada announced the charges Thursday, saying
the doctors supplied Perry with a large amount of ketamine and even
wondered in a text message how much the former “Friends” star would be
willing to pay.</p>
<p>“These defendants took advantage of Mr. Perry’s addiction issues to
enrich themselves. They knew what they were doing was wrong,” Estrada
said.</p>
<p>Perry died in October due to a ketamine overdose and received several
injections of the drug on the day he died from his live-in personal
assistant. The assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, is the one who found Perry
dead later that day.</p>
<p>The actor went to the two charged doctors in desperation after his
regular doctors refused to give him ketamine in the amounts he wanted.
DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said in one instance the actor paid
$2,000 for a vial of ketamine that cost one of the physicians about
$12.</p>
<p>Two of the people, including one of the doctors charged, were
arrested Thursday, Estrada said. Two of the defendants, including
Iwamasa, have pleaded guilty to charges already, and a third person has
agreed to plead guilty.</p>
<p>Multiple messages left seeking comment from lawyers or offices for
all the defendants have not yet been returned.</p>
<p>Among those arrested Thursday are Dr. Salvador Plasencia, who is
charged with seven counts of distribution of ketamine and also two
charges related to allegations he falsified records after Perry’s
death.</p>
<p>The other person arrested Thursday is Jasveen Sangha, who prosecutors
described as a drug dealer known as the “ketamine queen.”</p>
<p>Ketamine supplied by Sangha caused Perry’s death, authorities
said.</p>
<p>Sangha and Plasencia could make their first court appearances later
Thursday.</p>
<p>Records show Plascencia’s medical license has been in good standing
with no records of complaints, though it is set to expire in
October.</p>
<p>A San Diego physician, Dr. Mark Chavez, has agreed to plead guilty to
conspiracy to distribute ketamine. Prosecutors allege Chavez funneled
ketamine to Plasencia, securing some of the drug from a wholesale
distributor through a fraudulent prescription.</p>
<p>The prosecutor said the defendants exchanged messages soon after
Perry’s death referencing ketamine as the cause of death. Estrada said
they tried to cover up their involvement in supplying Perry ketamine, a
powerful anesthetic that is sometimes used to treat chronic pain and
depression.</p>
<p>Los Angeles police said in May that they were working with the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service
with a probe into why the 54-year-old had so much of the surgical
anesthetic in his system.</p>
<p>Iwamasa found the actor face down in his hot tub on Oct. 28, and
paramedics who were called immediately declared him dead.</p>
<p>The assistant received the ketamine from Eric Fleming, who has
pleaded guilty to obtaining the drug from Sangha and delivering it to
Iwamasa. In all, he delivered 50 vials of ketamine for Perry’s use,
including 25 handed over four days before the actor’s death.</p>
<p>Perry’s autopsy, released in December, found that the amount of
ketamine in his blood was in the range used for general anesthesia
during surgery.</p>
<p>Ketamine has seen a huge surge in use in recent years as a treatment
for depression, anxiety and pain. People close to Perry told coroner’s
investigators that he was undergoing ketamine infusion therapy.</p>
<p>But the medical examiner said Perry’s last treatment 1½ weeks earlier
wouldn’t explain the levels of ketamine in his blood. The drug is
typically metabolized in a matter of hours. At least two doctors were
treating Perry, a psychiatrist and an anesthesiologist who served as his
primary care physician, the medical examiner’s report said. No illicit
drugs or paraphernalia were found at his house.</p>
<p>Ketamine was listed as the primary cause of death, which was ruled an
accident with no foul play suspected, the report said. Drowning and
other medical issues were contributing factors, the coroner said.</p>
<p>Drug-related celebrity deaths have in other cases led authorities to
prosecute the people who supplied them.</p>
<p>After rapper Mac Miller died from an overdose of cocaine, alcohol and
counterfeit oxycodone that contained fentanyl, two of the men who
provided him the fentanyl were convicted of distributing the drug. One
was sentenced to more than 17 years in federal prison, the other to 10
years.</p>
<p>And after Michael Jackson died in 2009 from a lethal dose of
propofol, a drug intended for use only during surgery and other medical
procedures and not for the insomnia the singer sought it for, his
doctor, Conrad Murray, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in
2011. Murray has maintained his innocence.</p>

<p>The ambiguity of Ukraine’s ground offensive into the southern Kursk
region of Russia underscores its boldness. At least now, in Kursk
proper, and in the larger political realm, Ukraine has the initiative.
And in war, as military history shows, initiative is everything.</p>

asks judge to delay hush money sentencing until after election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Donald Trump is asking the judge in his New York hush
money criminal case to delay his sentencing until after the November
presidential election.</p>
<p>In a letter made public Thursday, a lawyer for the former president
and current Republican nominee suggested that sentencing Trump as
scheduled on September 18 — about seven weeks before Election Day —
would amount to election interference.</p>
<p>Trump lawyer Todd Blanche wrote that a delay would also allow Trump
time to weigh next steps after the trial judge, Juan Merchan, is
expected to rule September 16 on the defense’s request to overturn the
verdict and dismiss the case because of the U.S. Supreme Court’s July
presidential immunity ruling.</p>
<p>“There is no basis for continuing to rush,” Blanche wrote.</p>
<p>Blanche sent the letter to Merchan on Wednesday after the judge
rejected the defense’s latest request that he step aside from the
case.</p>
<p>In the letter, Blanche reiterated the defense argument that the judge
has a conflict of interest because his daughter works as a Democratic
political consultant, including for Kamala Harris when she sought the
2020 presidential nomination. Harris is now running against Trump.</p>
<p>By adjourning the sentencing until after that election, “the Court
would reduce, even if not eliminate, issues regarding the integrity of
any future proceedings,” Blanche wrote.</p>
<p>Merchan, who has said he is confident in his ability to remain fair
and impartial, did not immediately rule on the delay request.</p>
<p>A message seeking comment was left with the Manhattan district
attorney’s office, which prosecuted Trump’s case.</p>
<p>Trump was convicted in May of falsifying his business’ records to
conceal a 2016 deal to pay off porn actor Stormy Daniels to stay quiet
about her alleged 2006 sexual encounter with him. Prosecutors cast the
payout as part of a Trump-driven effort to keep voters from hearing
salacious stories about him during his first campaign.</p>
<p>Trump says all the stories were false, the business records were not
and the case was a political maneuver meant to damage his current
campaign. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is a Democrat.</p>
<p>Trump’s defense argued that the payments were indeed for legal work
and so were correctly categorized.</p>
<p>Falsifying business records is punishable by up to four years behind
bars. Other potential sentences include probation, a fine or a
conditional discharge which would require Trump to stay out of trouble
to avoid additional punishment. Trump is the first ex-president
convicted of a crime.</p>
<p>Trump has pledged to appeal, but that cannot happen until he is
sentenced.</p>
<p>In a previous letter, Merchan set September 18 for “the imposition of
sentence or other proceedings as appropriate.”</p>
<p>Blanche argued in his letter seeking a delay that the quick
turnaround from the scheduled immunity ruling on September 16 to
sentencing two days later is unfair to Trump.</p>
<p>To prepare for sentencing, Blanche argued, prosecutors will be
submitting their punishment recommendation while Merchan is still
weighing whether to dismiss the case on immunity grounds. If Merchan
rules against Trump on the dismissal request, he will need “adequate
time to assess and pursue state and federal appellate options,” Blanche
said.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s immunity decision reins in prosecutions of
ex-presidents for official acts and restricts prosecutors in pointing to
official acts as evidence that a president’s unofficial actions were
illegal. Trump’s lawyers argue that in light of the ruling, jurors in
the hush money case should not have heard such evidence as former White
House staffers describing how the then-president reacted to news
coverage of the Daniels deal.</p>

imposes sanctions targeting Houthi, Hezbollah trade</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States on Thursday issued more sanctions
targeting Houthi and Hezbollah trade networks, the U.S. Treasury
Department said, as Washington increases pressure on Tehran and the
Iranian-backed groups.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said it targeted
companies, individuals and vessels accused of being involved in the
shipment of Iranian commodities, including oil and liquefied petroleum
gas (LPG) to Yemen and the United Arab Emirates on behalf of a Houthi
financial official’s network.</p>
<p>It said the revenue from Sa’id al-Jamal’s network helps finance the
Houthis’ targeting of shipping in the Red Sea and civilian
infrastructure. Attacks on vessels in the Red Sea by Iran-aligned Houthi
militants have disrupted a shipping route vital to east-west trade, with
prolonged rerouting of shipments pushing freight rates higher and
causing congestion in Asian and European ports.</p>
<p>Also targeted on Thursday were Hezbollah shipments of LPG, including
through the designation of a Hong Kong-based ship manager and operator
as well as several tankers.</p>
<p>The Treasury said the Hezbollah-controlled Talaqi Group used two of
the tankers to ship LPG worth tens of millions of dollars from Iran to
China.</p>
<p>“Today’s action underscores our continued commitment to disrupting
Iran’s primary source of funding to its regional terrorist proxies like
Lebanese Hizballah (Hezbollah) and the Houthis,” said Treasury’s Acting
Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Bradley Smith.
 </p>
<p>“Our message is clear: those who seek to finance these groups’
destabilizing activities will be held to account.”</p>
<p>Thursday’s action freezes any U.S. assets of those targeted and
generally bars Americans from dealing with them. Financial institutions
and others that engage in certain transactions with them also risk being
hit with sanctions.</p>

id="vance-walz-agree-to-vp-debate-oct.-1-harris-floats-2nd-debate-with-trump">Vance,
Walz agree to VP debate Oct. 1; Harris floats 2nd debate with Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>COLUMBIA, South Carolina — Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Ohio
Senator JD Vance have agreed to debate each other on October 1, setting
up a matchup of potential vice presidents as early voting in some states
gets underway for the general election. </p>
<p>And Vice President Kamala Harris has forecast the scheduling of a
second debate between Donald Trump and herself, although that matchup
appeared to be contingent on the Republican nominee participating in the
scheduled September 10 debate with Harris. </p>
<p>CBS News on Wednesday posted on its X feed that the network had
invited both Vance and Walz to debate in New York City, presenting four
possible dates — September 17, September 24, October 1 and October 8 —
as options. </p>
<p>Walz reposted that message from his own campaign account, “See you on
October 1, JD.” The Harris-Walz campaign followed up with a message of
its own, saying Walz “looks forward to debating JD Vance — if he shows
up.” </p>
<p>Vance posted on X that he would accept the October 1 invitation. He
also challenged Walz to meet on September 18. </p>
<p>Officials with the Harris-Walz campaign did not immediately return a
message seeking comment on Vance’s acceptance of the earlier debate that
he said would be on CNN or whether Walz would participate in that one as
well. </p>
<p>Representatives for CNN confirmed that Vance had accepted the
network’s debate invitation. </p>
<p>“CBS Evening News” anchor Norah O’Donnell and Margaret Brennan of
“Face the Nation” will moderate the October 1 debate, according to the
network. </p>
<p>Whether Walz and Vance would debate before the November 5 general
election had been in question. </p>
<p>The debate is three weeks after the September 10 top-of-the-ticket
debate recently solidified between Trump and Harris on ABC News. </p>
<p>Trump has said he negotiated several other debate dates, on three
different networks. Fox News has also proposed a debate between Harris
and Trump to take place on September 4, and NBC News is angling to air
one on September 25. </p>
<p>During an appearance in Michigan, Harris said she was “happy to have
that conversation” about an additional debate. </p>
<p>On Thursday, Harris’ campaign said Trump had “accepted our proposal
for three debates,” meaning one between the vice presidential running
mates, in addition to two presidential debates. Provided that Trump
participates in the September 10 CBS debate, Harris-Walz spokesperson
Michael Tyler said that “the American people will have another
opportunity” to see the vice president and Donald Trump on the debate
stage in October,” without mentioning a specific date or network. </p>
<p>Neither campaign immediately responded to a message seeking comment
on whether a date or network had been agreed to for a second
presidential debate.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
I resent my go-to charging depot.
</p>
<p>
Don’t get me wrong: I was psyched when Tesla opened a Supercharger in
the parking lot of a nearby In-N-Out burger. The other local
Supercharger is located in a garage that charges for parking by the
hour. Plus, it’s fun to grab a neapolitan shake while your vehicle gets
juice. The problem is that <em><em>everybody</em></em> in Southern
California loves In-N-Out, so reaching the chargers at dinnertime means
navigating through the unruly drive-thru line. This sucks, especially
when the battery is nearly depleted and the burger faithful won’t get
out of the way.
</p>
<p>
More than a year ago, salvation was promised in the form of a
<a href="https://supercharge.info/map?siteID=6319" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>new
Supercharger</u></a> at a nearby mall, one where I already frequent the
Petco. But construction has mysteriously stalled. I stare at the
charging map and repeatedly refresh, waiting for the station to come
online.
</p>
<p>
I shouldn’t be surprised at Supercharger deployment being stuck, of
course. Earlier this year, in a move nominally intended to keep Tesla
nimble and innovative, Elon Musk
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/inside-story-elon-musks-mass-firings-tesla-supercharger-staff-2024-05-15/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>laid
off the team</u></a> responsible for the Supercharger network at a
moment when they were perhaps the most useful people at the company.
</p>
<p>
While the rest of Tesla sputtered with the rollout of the Cybertruck and
reversed course on what to do next, the Supercharger team was preparing
for a future in which drivers in EVs from basically all the other car
brands could stop at Tesla’s fast-chargers and give the company their
money. Instead of leaning into this advantage, Tesla has done the
opposite. The Supercharger network is growing, but deployment has
proceeded at a
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/07/16/tesla-supercharger-deployment-slowing-down-critical-time/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>slower</u></a>
pace than during the same period in 2023. Before the mass layoff, Tesla
was opening more than 30 new Supercharger sites per week; that number
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJ0xOv8K8ro" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dipped</u></a>
to about 15 afterward.
</p>
<p>
The slowdown matters to a lot of people on the road. Despite Tesla’s
recent sales slowdown, its cars make up the vast majority of EVs in
America. Deprioritizing the Supercharger network is an annoyance for all
those drivers, who may have a harder time taking a road trip to
<a href="https://supercharge.info/map?siteID=6661" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Big
Bend National Park</u></a>,
<a href="https://supercharge.info/map?siteID=7741" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Branson</u></a>,
or Aunt Betty’s house in the boondocks if promised charging depots stay
in limbo.
</p>
<p>
Fewer new Superchargers will make existing stations more congested, too,
and that’s before vehicles from other car companies
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-supercharger-ford-gm" target="_self"><u>begin
to arrive en masse</u></a>. On a road trip to Lake Tahoe last week I saw
my first Rivian plugged into a Tesla station. Ford EVs are starting to
get their adapters. Next year, carmakers will begin to build their EVs
with Tesla’s North American Charging Standard plug, which will greatly
increase congestion at existing Superchargers, especially on popular
highway routes.
</p>
<p>
Whether future EV road trips are convenient or frustrating depends in
large part on whether the rest of the industry can pick up the slack
should Tesla continue to slow down Supercharger deployment. The track
record of competitors like Electrify America and EVgo isn’t inspiring,
as their stations have, to date, tended to be rarer, smaller, and more
prone to mechanical failure.
</p>
<p>
Other car companies have pledged to build their own charging depots,
which would ease some of the strain. Hope for a better charging future,
however, lies largely with the
<a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>National
Electric Vehicle Infrastructure</u></a> program, which came out of the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021 and allocated $5 billion to build
fast-charging stations along designated highway corridors across the
country —
<a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/stations#/corridors" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>see
a map of them here</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
That money is slowly rolling out in tranches to the states, which had
the responsibility of putting forth plans for where they’d build plugs
with the money. The result is a patchwork, state-by-state agenda for
upgrading the American charging network, but the work is underway.
<a href="https://drive.ohio.gov/about-driveohio/news/nevi-groundbreaking" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Ohio</u></a>
began construction of the first NEVI-funded charger last October, and
you can see where
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/07/03/alabama-just-announced-its-first-13-federally-funded-ev-charging-stations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Alabama</u></a>
and
<a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/02/vdot-announces-sites-for-electric-vehicle-charging-stations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Virginia</u></a>,
for example, plan to put theirs. Crucially, much of the funding has
already been dispersed. If an EV-unfriendly new president takes office
in January, the ball is already rolling.
</p>
<p>
What’s unclear is whether all these charging depots can match the
standard of excellence the Supercharger team created before Musk blew it
to bits. Take Alabama’s chargers, which will mostly be built at existing
Love’s gas stations. The new stations meet the bare minimum required for
NEVI, which is that they have four plugs each capable of delivering 150
kilowatts of power. Tesla’s newest batch of Superchargers deliver 250
kilowatts; Electrify America has some that reach 350. The 20-odd
Superchargers
<a href="https://supercharge.info/map" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>already
in Alabama</u></a> offer at least six to eight plugs, with many stations
hosting 12 or 16.
</p>
<p>
Every plug counts. Every time a new station fills in a spot on the
nation’s charging map, drivers will be a little more confident that an
EV will be able to take them anywhere they need to go. But if the Biden
dollars dispersed through NEVI are going to take the place of Tesla’s
Supercharger outfit, then the states need to do more than the bare
minimum.

2024-08-14 Web applications
</h1>
<p>
For my own peace of mind, I have resolved to no longer think of websites
as “websites”. Instead, there are <em>web documents</em> and <em>web
applications</em>. I find it easier to accept to use a browser like
Firefox like a virtual computer for web applications. Many of the
websites these days are in fact web applications.
</p>
<p>
There’s no point in railing against web applications. I like to write
web applications! And I use many of them myself, too. Things like
<a href="Face_Generator">Face Generator</a>, <a href="Text_Mapper">Text
Mapper</a> or <a href="Hex_Describe">Hex Describe</a> are impossible to
do as documents. In an emergency, you could have a form that then
generates a PDF to download, maybe? But is that really preferable? I
don’t think so.
</p>
<p>
And don’t get me started on writing native graphical user-interface
applications. It takes so much energy to get it right. It gives me a
headache. I tried. Take a look at

answer. It’s like a piece of performance art: the doing of it is a
statement. People who step into it are confounded, their beliefs
challenged. It’s good art! It’s interesting technology. But it’s not a
replacement for <em>web applications</em>. It’s not even a good format
for <em>web documents</em>! I want inline emphasis – bold, italics, code
– and accessible tables with captions and cell navigation, and
row-spans, and column-spans. I tried writing code that translated
Wikipedia tables into ASCII tables to be used as pre-formatted text in
Gemtext. It’s hard to do well with the sizing of columns, the line
wrapping in cells, the limited space available in a terminal, and when
you’ve solved all of that, it’s still hell for people with bad eye-sight
or cognitive problems trying to understand what they’re seeing. It’s
terrible. You could of course do away with all tables. But is that
really preferable? I don’t think so.

And so… there’s that bifurcation in the road. For this site, for most of
the pages that I think of as <em>web documents</em>, I write (or
generate) HTML that doesn’t require fonts or scripts. If one uses
browsers such as eww, links2, w3m, lynx or dillo, it should just work. I
wasn’t going to convert the corporate web, anyway.

I still serve my site as Gemini and Gopher. But I do it as a political
statement, as a piece of performance art.

id="us-judge-says-hell-tear-the-barriers-down-on-googles-app-store-monopoly">US
judge says he’ll ‘tear the barriers down’ on Google’s app store
monopoly</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Last week wasn’t the first time Google was declared a monopoly –
eight months ago, in the Epic vs. Google case, Google’s control over the
Play Store was also declared monopolistic. The judge, Google, and Epic
have been arguing ever since over possible remedies, and in two weeks’
time, we’ll know what the judge is going to demand of Google. Eight
months after a federal jury unanimously decided that Google’s Android
app store is an illegal monopoly in Epic v. Google, Donato held his
final hearing on remedies today. While we don’t yet know what will
happen, he repeatedly shut down any suggestion that Google shouldn’t
have to open up its store to rival stores, that it’d be too much work or
cost too much, or that the proposed remedies go too far. “We’re going to
tear the barriers down, it’s just the way it’s going to happen,” said
Donato. “The world that exists today is the product of monopolistic
conduct. That world is changing.” Donato will issue his final ruling in
a little over two weeks. ↫ Sean Hollister at The Verge I was a bit
confused by what “opening up” the Play Store really meant, since Android
is already quite friendly to installing whatever other applications and
application stores you want, but what they’re talking about here is
allowing rival application stores inside the Play Store. This way,
instead of downloading, say, the F-Droid APK from the web and installing
it, you could just install the F-Droid application store straight from
within the Play Store. Epic wants the judge to take it a step further
and force Google to also give rival application stores access to every
Play Store application, allowing them to take ownership of said
applications, I guess? I’m not entirely sure how that would work,
considering I doubt there’d be much overlap between the offerings of the
various stores. The prospect of micromanaging where every application
gets its updates from seems like a lot of busywork, but at the same
time, it’s the kind of fine-grained control power users would really
enjoy. A point of contention is whether or not Google would have to
perform human review on every application store and their applications
inside the Play Store, and even if Google should have any form of
control at all. What’s interesting about all these court cases in the
United States is how closely the arguments and proposed remedies align
with the European Digital Markets Act. Where the EU made a set of pretty
clear and straightforward rules for megacorporations to follow, thereby
creating a level playing field for all of them, the US seems to want to
endlessly take each offending company to court, which feels quite messy,
time-consuming, and arbitrary, especially when medieval nonsense like
jury trials are involved. This is probably a result of the US using
common law, whereas the EU uses civil (Napoleonic) law, but it’s
interesting nonetheless.</p>

<h2 id="the-iras-labor-provisions-look-like-theyre-working">The IRA’s
Labor Provisions Look Like They’re Working</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-15, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzE3MDE1MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NTExNTE4Nn0.9hcWfCLUaA6e-IP624LfcAAuoyWE8jslUiR_DRsQtqA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The Inflation Reduction Act is by far the most important climate law
ever passed in the U.S. But it also may go down as one of the most
important labor laws of recent history. Overnight, jobs installing solar
farms that were largely performed by an
<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/shifting-america-to-solar-power-is-a-grueling-low-paid-job/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>itinerant,
low-wage workforce</u></a> had the potential to become higher-paid
positions occupied by skilled tradespeople — maybe even union jobs.
</p>
<p>
That’s because in order to qualify for a 30% tax credit on their
investment or operating costs, clean energy developers now have to
follow two key labor standards. They have to pay construction workers
the federally determined prevailing wage for their region, plus hire a
designated number of apprentices, who are provided with paid classroom
instruction in addition to on-the-job-training.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think people have a sense of the scale and the scope of what
this law has done and is going to do,” Rick Levy, the president of the
Texas AFL-CIO, told me. “From our perspective, putting community
well-being and labor standards in the very fabric of this industrial
expansion is going to pay dividends for generations.”
</p>
<p>
On the eve of the IRA’s two-year anniversary, a
<a href="http://cjnrc.org/breaking-ground-ira" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>new
report</u></a> provided exclusively to Heatmap has identified 6,285
utility-scale clean energy projects planned, under construction, or
already operating, that are likely candidates for these tax credits.
Together, they represent an estimated 3.9 million jobs, according to the
Climate Jobs National Resource Center, a nonprofit that supports unions
fighting for worker-centered climate action, which compiled the data.
</p>
<p>
There’s no way to know, at least right now, how many of the projects
still in progress will actually get built, or how many have or will
adhere to labor standards. Safe harbor provisions in the law also allow
developers to claim the full tax credit without adhering to the rules as
long as they started construction by the end of January 2023, so the
full effect of the provisions will take some time to be realized.
</p>
<p>
But the report reveals the vast potential for the law to create
higher-quality jobs in clean energy all over the country. Based on my
reporting, that potential is starting to materialize. Union leaders told
me they’re now having conversations with developers who never returned
their calls before. And renewable energy developers and tax credit
consultants told me it was a no-brainer to meet the labor standards,
even though they create substantial administrative burdens. Otherwise,
they’ll only be eligible for a 6% credit, leaving a huge amount of money
on the table.
</p>
<h3>
“The lawyers are scaring everyone about this”
</h3>
<p>
Mike Fishman, the executive director of the Climate Jobs National
Resource Center, told me that when he first started advocating for
high-road climate jobs, he found that many trades workers were afraid of
clean energy. “If they had a good job in the fossil fuel industry, then
saying, we’re going to reach these goals and shut down all the fossil
fuel plants, that was very scary to people.” But since the IRA passed,
he’s seen a change in workers’ attitudes about supporting climate
action. “It creates a sense that there’s a future for everyone — an
economic future, as well as a climate future,” Fishman said.
</p>
<p>
The IRA’s potential to spur well-paid jobs and training opportunities is
actually even larger than the Resource Center’s estimate indicates. The
report only covers clean energy <em><em>generation</em></em> projects
like wind and solar farms, but the law also tied labor standards to tax
credits for the construction of clean energy
<em><em>manufacturing</em></em> plants, EV chargers, carbon capture
projects, hydrogen plants, clean fuel factories, and new,
energy-efficient buildings.
</p>
<p>
The standards are likely to affect each of these industries in different
ways, but it’s instructive to look at what’s already happening in
renewable energy development. To do so, you first have to understand
that developers sit near the top of a ladder of companies involved in
bringing an energy project into the world. Above them sits investors;
below, a series of contractors and subcontractors who manage the project
on the ground and hire the workers who ultimately build it.
</p>
<p>
Before the IRA, everyone along this ladder had an incentive to keep
costs as low as possible. At the top,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/16/business/economy/green-energy-jobs-economy.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>developers
are competing for power contracts with utilities</u></a>. Contractors
would try to win bids by quoting the lowest construction costs. Staffing
agencies would source temporary workers from all over the country and
negotiate wages and benefits on a case by case basis. An
<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/shifting-america-to-solar-power-is-a-grueling-low-paid-job/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>investigation
into solar work by </u><u><em><em>Vice</em></em></u></a><em> </em>found
that it was “common to have two workers doing the same job for vastly
different pay and living stipends.” Some would travel to a new place for
a gig and “pile into motel rooms with other workers on the same projects
in order to save money.”
</p>
<p>
The IRA disrupts that incentive structure, creating a new regime whereby
the top priority is getting that 30% tax credit. The law also extended
the ladder, creating new rungs of accountability thanks to new tax
credit transferability rules that allow developers to sell their tax
credits to third parties. That means there are a host of other companies
looming over developers’ shoulders with a stake in making sure they
don’t cheat the rules. Tax credit buyers don’t want to end up in a
situation where the IRS audits the developer who sold them the credits,
finds that there weren’t enough apprentices on the project, and claws
back the money. The risk is serious enough that buyers also purchase
insurance for these transactions, adding another layer of oversight.
</p>
<p>
“The lawyers are scaring everyone about this,” Derek Silverman, the
co-founder and chief product officer of Basis Climate, a startup that
matches tax credit buyers and sellers, told me. For example, the law
contains a loophole for companies to claim the credit without hiring the
required number of apprentices as long as they show they made a “good
faith effort.” Treasury defines that as having reached out to at least
one registered apprenticeship program in the area every year the project
is operating. Silverman said he’s seen lawyers challenge companies that
are trying to get around the requirement, asking them who they reached
out to and berating them if it wasn’t a legitimate effort.
</p>
<p>
“They’re saying, you have a huge part of your capital stack that’s based
off this tax credit,” said Silverman. “It’s not worth the downside of
the government questioning through an audit that you didn’t meet these
requirements, and then, boom, you owe them $20 million when it would
have cost you $100,000 to do the documentation and get that all square.”
</p>
<p>
The upside is valuable enough that it’s generated a whole new cottage
industry in tax credit compliance. Empact Technologies, for example, is
a software company that collects and evaluates payroll data from
contractors to make sure they are paying the correct wages and have the
right number of apprentices. “Then we have to go back and essentially
fix all of the mistakes that they made every single week” — like
classifying workers incorrectly and paying them the wrong amount, or
falling behind on apprenticeship hours — “which every single contractor
does. It’s insane,” Charles Dauber, Empact’s founder, told me.
</p>
<p>
All of this has added much complexity — and cost — to renewable energy
development. David Yaros, who co-leads Deloitte’s US Tax Sustainability
Practice, told me that the cost of compliance, including hiring
companies like Empact and Deloitte to compile all the documentation,
could eat into 5% to 20% of the tax benefits.
</p>
<p>
“This has raised our costs,” Rodrigo Inurreta Acero, a government
affairs manager at the international developer EDP Renewables,
confirmed, referring specifically to the added cost of consultants
rather than the mostly negligible cost of paying prevailing wages. “But,
we are very, very happy to comply with this, because the juice is worth
the squeeze.”
</p>
<h3>
Building a union pipeline
</h3>
<p>
There’s clear incentives for developers to do everything in their power
to meet the labor standards. The key question is whether these two
little provisions — prevailing wage and apprenticeships — are strong
enough to “build a strong pipeline of highly-skilled workers” and
“ensure clean energy jobs are good-paying jobs,” as the
<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2413" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Biden
administration has said</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
The need is definitely there. A
<a href="https://irecusa.org/census-workforce-development/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>census
of U.S. solar jobs in 2022</u></a> found that 52% of solar installation
and project development companies found it “very difficult” to find
qualified workers, with electricians and construction workers being
among the most difficult positions to fill.
</p>
<p>
But even if armies of lawyers are scaring companies into making serious
efforts to hire apprentices, that doesn’t mean they are actually finding
them. “It’s not clear at this stage whether apprenticeship programs are
scaling up fast enough to match labor supply to project demand,” Derrick
Flakoll, a policy associate at BloombergNEF told me. He pointed to an
announcement made by the White House just last month of $244 million in
grants to expand the Registered Apprenticeship system throughout the
country. “I’d be skeptical that apprenticeship programs have been able
to scale up yet,” said Flakoll.
</p>
<p>
There’s a catch with the wage requirement, too: “Prevailing wage”
doesn’t necessarily mean a living wage, and it can vary dramatically
from place to place. The rate is determined by
<a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/government-contracts/prevailing-wage-resource-book/db-surveys" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>surveys
sent out to contractors and labor organizations</u></a>, and is
typically higher in jurisdictions with active labor unions. For example,
in Falls County, Texas, where the 640 megawatt Roseland Solar project is
under construction, prevailing wage for a general laborer is
<a href="https://sam.gov/wage-determination/TX20240091/0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$8.75
an hour</u></a>. In Sangamon County, Illinois, where the 800 megawatt
Black Diamond Solar project is being built, prevailing wage for a
laborer is
<a href="https://sam.gov/wage-determination/IL20240015/8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$34.04
an hour</u></a> plus benefits worth $29.26 an hour.
</p>
<p>
Nico Ries, the lead organizer for the Green Workers Alliance, which
organizes solar and wind workers, told me solar wages seem to have only
increased in places with higher union density. That’s because unions are
now on a more even playing-field to compete for jobs in those areas,
since their typical rates have become the de facto minimum.
</p>
<p>
To be clear, the prevailing wage and apprenticeship provisions do not
require developers to hire <em><em>union</em></em> workers to build
their projects. And there are plenty of non-union, registered
apprenticeships. Ries told me that the temp staffing agencies that have
served the solar industry in the past are quickly standing up
apprenticeship programs to stay on top of the market under the IRA. The
main problem with that, they said, is that unlike union apprentices,
these workers have no representation.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a lot of misinformation,” Ries said. “People think they are
joining an apprenticeship and it’s going to be a whole thing, but it’s
really just a little training or two, and then they slap a sticker on
your hard hat.”
</p>
<p>
Nonetheless, unions are starting to make inroads in solar in places that
have long been hostile to organized labor. Ethan Link, the assistant
business manager for the Southeast Laborers’ District Council, which has
members in right-to-work states throughout the south, told me that
before and after the IRA was like “night and day.” For the first time,
solar developers are calling the union directly to talk about projects
on the horizon and to figure out how to work with them. As a result, the
union is investing in more solar-specific training for its
apprenticeship instructors.
</p>
<p>
“The Inflation Reduction Act is one of the most consequential and, I
think, also most innovative ways of inducing the market to have broad
based benefits for the community,” Link said. “The way I’ve experienced
it, it’s changed the landscape on the ground with these developers
within a matter of months, rather than a matter of years.” He said they
don’t yet have a lot of workers actually assigned to projects, but
“we’re really optimistic about where things sit right now.”
</p>
<p>
Kent Miller, president of the Wisconsin Laborers’ District Council, told
me his union has been able to double its apprenticeship program from
around 300 to 400 students a few years ago to closer to 700 to 800
post-IRA. It’s now looking to build another training campus to expand
its capacity. Not all of that growth is thanks to renewable energy, he
said, but the union now has a significant portion of its membership that
just works in utility-scale solar.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, Wisconsin’s four biggest electric utilities
<a href="https://www.wxpr.org/energy-environment/2024-04-16/wi-utilities-make-union-jobs-a-priority-for-green-projects" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pledged</u></a>
to employ local, union labor on all future renewable energy projects.
Miller doesn’t think this would have happened without the incentives in
the IRA. Though
<a href="https://www.cjnrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Building-Good-Local-Jobs-On-Clean-Energy-Projects-in-WI.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>every
wind farm in Wisconsin has been built by union labor</u></a>, the more
nascent solar industry was starting to
<a href="https://apps.psc.wi.gov/ERF/ERFview/viewdoc.aspx?docid=383490" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bring
in non-union workers from out of state</u></a> to build projects. The
IRA incentives gave Miller’s union leverage in negotiations with the
utilities, because future projects were going to need to be able to find
registered apprentices. “Unions run the best registered apprenticeship
programs,” he said. “It was showing what we could do, what we could
bring to the table.”
</p>
<p>
There is one more small but potentially powerful incentive for
developers to work with unions. The Internal Revenue Service has said
that if companies sign a project labor agreement — an agreement with one
or more unions, made prior to hiring, that establishes wages and
benefits — then they are less likely to be audited, and won’t have to
pay penalties if they are found to be non-compliant.
</p>
<h3>
A post-post-industrial future
</h3>
<p>
To Levy, of the AFL-CIO in Texas, and others in the labor movement,
getting workers to support clean energy is essential to tackling climate
change. “Unless workers see themselves and their interests reflected in
these new energy technologies, there’s never going to be the kind of
political support that we need to be able to do the things we need to do
to save the planet,” Levy said. The first step to achieve that, he said,
is making sure these jobs are “good union jobs.”
</p>
<p>
The Climate Jobs National Resource Center connected me with Kim Tobias,
a union electrician in Maine, as an example of how union jobs can change
lives. Tobias used to work in call centers, providing customer service
for healthcare software companies, before leaving to join the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. She was making $16 an
hour in her last call center job after more than 10 years in the field,
and was fed up after getting passed over for a promotion. When she
started as an electrical apprentice in 2019, she essentially doubled her
salary overnight once benefits were taken into account.
</p>
<p>
Today, in part because of the IRA, but also because of a
<a href="https://www.maine.gov/labor/labor_laws/efc/index.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>state
law</u></a> that requires developers to pay prevailing wage on all large
renewable projects in Maine, Tobias mainly works on solar projects. The
work isn’t always ideal — she told me she once had to commute 75 miles
away for a solar job — while she was pregnant, no less. “Then again, a
year and a half later, I worked a solar job that was 0.9 miles away from
my house. So it’s give and take,” she said.
</p>
<p>
But Tobias also said she sees potential to create high-quality clean
energy jobs beyond solar in Maine, where, she lamented, “people under
the age of 30 are leaving in droves.” She noted that an old paper mill
in Lincoln, Maine, is being turned into an energy storage site, and the
developer has already said it would
<a href="https://maineaflcio.org/news/unions-applaud-strong-labor-standards-proposal-build-energy-storage-facility" target="_blank"><u>establish
a collective bargaining agreement</u></a> with the Maine Building and
Construction Trades. Illustrating Levy’s point about political support,
the union is also now
<a href="https://mainebeacon.com/single-most-important-climate-project-we-will-ever-have-maine-unions-back-wind-energy-port-plan/" target="_blank"><u>advocating
for the construction of a new port</u></a> to support the offshore wind
industry, which would have to be built with union labor
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/24/maine-governor-reaches-offshore-wind-deal-with-labor-unions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>under
a recent state law</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Even if the IRA’s labor provisions are starting to work, which it seems
they are, they contain one significant weakness. The rules only apply to
the construction of projects — not to their operations. It’s an
improvement to have labor standards for construction jobs. But once they
are built, wind and solar farms don’t take many people to operate. The
federally subsidized clean energy manufacturing plants springing up
around the country due to the IRA will create a lot more jobs, but, at
least right now, those jobs don’t have to be “good.”
</p>
<p>
“I think that people need to understand the opportunity here,” said
Levy, and make sure that we continue to build on it and not turn back.”
</p>
<p>

faith effort” exception to the apprenticeship provision and that both
provisions apply only to construction.</em><br/>

Dotcom to be extradited from New Zealand after 12-year fight with
US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Wellington, New Zealand — Kim Dotcom, who is facing criminal charges
relating to the defunct file-sharing website Megaupload, will be
extradited to the United States from New Zealand, the New Zealand
justice minister said on Thursday.</p>
<p>German-born Dotcom, who has New Zealand residency, has been fighting
extradition to the United States since 2012 following a FBI-ordered raid
on his Auckland mansion.</p>
<p>Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith signed an extradition order for
Dotcom, a spokesperson for the Minister of Justice said</p>
<p>“I considered all of the information carefully and have decided that
Mr Dotcom should be surrendered to the U.S. to face trial,” Goldsmith
said in a statement.</p>
<p>“As is common practice, I have allowed Mr Dotcom a short period of
time to consider and take advice on my decision. I will not, therefore,
be commenting further at this stage.”</p>
<p>In a post on social media website X on Tuesday, Dotcom said “the
obedient US colony in the South Pacific just decided to extradite me for
what users uploaded to Megaupload,” in what appears to be a reference to
the extradition order.</p>
<p>Reuters could not immediately contact Dotcom for a response.</p>
<p>U.S. authorities say Dotcom and three other Megaupload executives
cost film studios and record companies more than $500 million by
encouraging paying users to store and share copyrighted material, which
generated more than $175 million in revenue for the website.</p>
<p>The company’s chief marketing officer Finn Batato and chief technical
officer and co-founder Mathias Ortmann, both from Germany, along with a
third executive, Dutch national Bram van der Kolk, were arrested with
Dotcom in 2012.</p>
<p>Ortmann and van der Kolk entered plea deals that saw them sentenced
in 2023 to jail terms in New Zealand but allowed them to avoid
extradition. Batato died in 2022 in New Zealand.</p>

id="as-colorado-river-states-await-water-cuts-they-struggle-to-agree-on-longer-term-plans">As
Colorado River states await water cuts, they struggle to agree on
longer-term plans</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The federal government is expected to announce water
cuts soon that would affect some of the 40 million people reliant on the
Colorado River, the powerhouse of the U.S. West. The Interior Department
announces water availability for the coming year months in advance so
Western cities, farmers and others can plan.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, however, more elusive plans are being hashed out:
how the basin will share water from the diminishing 2,334-kilometer
river after 2026, when many current guidelines that govern it
expire.</p>
<p>The Colorado River supplies water to seven Western states, more than
two dozen Native American tribes, and two states in Mexico. It also
irrigates millions of acres of farmland in the American West and
generates hydropower used across the region. Years of overuse combined
with rising temperatures and drought have meant less water flows in the
Colorado today than in decades past.</p>
<p>That’s made the fraught politics of water in the West particularly
deadlocked at times. Here’s what you need to know about the negotiations
surrounding the river.</p>
<p>What are states discussing?</p>
<p>Plans for how to distribute the Colorado River’s water after 2026. A
series of overlapping agreements, court decisions and contracts
determine how the river is shared, some of which expire at the end of
2025.</p>
<p>In 2007, following years of drought, the seven U.S. states in the
basin — Arizona, Nevada, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and
Wyoming — and the federal government adopted rules to better respond to
lower water levels at Lake Mead and Lake Powell. Those are the river’s
two main reservoirs that transfer and store Colorado River water,
produce hydropower and serve as barometers of its health.</p>
<p>The 2007 rules determine when some states face water cuts based on
levels at Lake Mead. That’s why states, Native American tribes, and
others are drafting new plans, which anticipate even deeper water cuts
after 2026 based on projections of the river’s flow and climate modeling
of future warming in the West.</p>
<p>“The ultimate problem is that watershed runoff is decreasing due to
an ever-warming climate,” said Jack Schmidt, professor of watershed
sciences at Utah State University, and director of the Center for
Colorado River studies. “The proximate problem is we’ve got to decrease
our use.”</p>
<p>How are these talks different from expected cuts this month?</p>
<p>Sometime this month, the federal government will announce water cuts
for 2025 based on levels at Lake Mead. The cuts may simply maintain the
restrictions already in place. Reclamation considers factors like
precipitation, runoff, and water use to model what levels at the two
reservoirs will look like over the following two years. If Lake Mead
drops below a certain level, Arizona, California, Nevada and Mexico are
subject to cuts, though California has so far been spared because of its
senior water rights.</p>
<p>In recent years, Arizona has faced the bulk of these cuts, while
Mexico and Nevada also saw reductions. But these are short-term plans,
and the guidelines surrounding them are being renegotiated for the
future.</p>
<p>What are states already doing to conserve water?</p>
<p>Arizona, Nevada and Mexico faced federal water cuts from the river in
2022. Those deepened in 2023 and returned to 2022 levels this year. As
the crisis on the river worsened, Arizona, California and Nevada last
year agreed to conserve an additional 3 million acre-feet of water until
2026, with the U.S. government paying water districts and other users
for much of that conservation.</p>
<p>Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming — the state’s so-called Upper
Basin — don’t use their full 7.5 million acre-foot allocation from the
river, and get a percentage of the water that’s available each year.</p>
<p>An acre-foot is enough water to serve roughly two to three U.S.
households in a year.</p>
<p>Have these efforts worked?</p>
<p>Yes, for now. A wet 2023 plus conservation efforts by Lower Basin
states improved the short-term outlook for both reservoirs. Lake Powell
is at roughly 39% capacity while Mead is at about 33%.</p>
<p>Climate scientists and hydrologists say that higher temperatures
driven by climate change will continue to reduce runoff to the Colorado
River in coming years, and cause more water to be lost to evaporation,
so future plans should prepare for less water in the system. Brad Udall,
a senior water and climate scientist at Colorado State University, said
predicting precipitation levels is harder to do.</p>
<p>The short-term recovery in the Colorado River basin should be viewed
in the context of a more challenging future, he added.</p>
<p>“I would push back heartily against any idea that our rebound over
the last couple of years here is some permanent shift,” Udall said.</p>
<p>What can’t states agree on?</p>
<p>What to do after 2026. In March, Upper and Lower Basin states, tribes
and environmental groups released plans for how the river and its
reservoirs should be managed in the future.</p>
<p>Arizona, California and Nevada asked the federal government to take a
more expansive view of the river management and factor water levels in
seven reservoirs instead of just Lake Powell and Lake Mead to determine
the extent of water cuts. If the whole system drops below 38% capacity,
their plan said, deeper cuts should be shared evenly with the Upper
Basin and Mexico.</p>
<p>“We are trying to find the right, equitable outcome in which the
Upper Basin doesn’t have to take all of the pain from the long-term
reduction of the river, but we also can’t be the only ones protecting
Lake Powell,” said Tom Buschatzke, director of Arizona’s Department of
Water Resources and the state’s lead negotiator in the talks.</p>
<p>Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming called for addressing
shortages based on the combined capacity of Lake Powell and Lake Mead,
as opposed to just Lake Mead. It proposed more aggressive cuts that
would affect California, Arizona and Nevada sooner when the major
reservoir levels fall. Their plan doesn’t call for reductions in how
much water is delivered to Upper Basin states.</p>
<p>Becky Mitchell, the lead negotiator for the state of Colorado, said
the Upper Basin’s plan focuses more on making policy with an eye on the
river’s supply, rather than the demands for its water.</p>
<p>“It’s important we start acknowledging that there’s not as much water
available as folks would like,” Mitchell said.</p>
<p>Where does it go from here?</p>
<p>The federal government is expected to issue draft regulations by
December that factor in the different plans and propose a way forward.
Until then, states, tribes and other negotiators will continue talking
and trying to reach agreement.</p>

Fair of Texas bans firearms, drawing threats from state AG</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DALLAS — The State Fair of Texas is laying down a new rule before
millions of visitors flock through the gates for corn dogs, deep-fried
delights and a friendly wave from a five-story cowboy named Big Tex: No
guns allowed.</p>
<p>But that decision by fair organizers — which comes after a shooting
last year on the 112-hectare fairgrounds in the heart of Dallas — has
drawn outrage from Republican lawmakers, who in recent years have
proudly expanded gun rights in Texas. On Wednesday, the state’s attorney
general threatened a lawsuit unless the fair reversed course.</p>
<p>“Dallas has 15 days to fix the issue,” Republican Texas Attorney
General Ken Paxton said in a statement, “otherwise I will see them in
court.”</p>
<p>Tensions over where and how gun owners can carry firearms in public
are frequent in Texas, but the standoff with one of the state’s most
beloved institutions has moved the fight onto unusual turf. The fair has
not backed down since cowboy hat-wearing organizers announced the new
policy at a news conference last week.</p>
<p>The fair, which reopens in September and lasts for nearly a month,
dates back to 1886. In addition to a maze of midway games, car shows and
the Texas Star Ferris wheel — one of the tallest in the U.S. — the
fairgrounds are also home to the annual college football rivalry between
the University of Texas and University of Oklahoma. And after Big Tex,
the towering cowboy that greets fairgoers, went up in flames in 2012 due
to an electrical short, the fair mascot was met with great fanfare upon
its return.</p>
<p>But a shooting near the rows of food booths last year dampened the
revelry.</p>
<p>Investigators said one man opened fire on another, injuring three
people and resulting in police clearing the fairgrounds. Videos posted
on social media showed groups of people running along sidewalks and
climbing barriers as they fled.</p>
<p>Defending the new policy Wednesday, fair spokesperson Karissa
Condoianis acknowledged it has attracted “both criticism and praise.”
She noted that the fair previously allowed gun owners to carry concealed
weapons “even after virtually all other public events ceased to allow
the same.”</p>
<p>“This is the right decision moving forward to ensure a safe
environment and family-friendly atmosphere,” Condoianis said.</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers urged the fair to reconsider in a letter signed
by more than 70 legislators, arguing that the ban made the fairgrounds
less safe and was “anything but a celebration of Texas.”</p>
<p>In a separate letter to the City of Dallas, Paxton argued that the
ban infringes on the rights of Texas gun owners. The city owns Fair
Park, where the annual fair takes place; Paxton argued that gun owners
can carry on property owned or leased by the government unless otherwise
prohibited by state law.</p>
<p>A city spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday that they were
reviewing Paxton’s letter “and will respond accordingly.”</p>
<p>Condoianis said Wednesday that the fair, which is a private,
not-for-profit organization, “is not a government entity nor is it
controlled by a government entity.” She said they are aware of Paxton’s
letter to the city, and that it appears he’s “seeking clarification” on
the city’s relationship with the fair and its use of Fair Park under the
long-term lease agreement between the two parties.</p>
<p>Condoianis also disagreed that the ban makes the fair less safe,
saying the policy is similar to rules at large community gatherings such
as sporting events and concerts. She also noted that 200 uniformed and
armed Dallas police officers and fair safety team members will be
patrolling the fairgrounds. The fair said on its website that attendees
go through a screening process before entering.</p>
<p>The fair is a “microcosm of the kind of mystique that comes with
Texas,” said Brian Franklin, associate director of the Center for
Presidential History at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. The
fair, he said, speaks to Texans’ desire to emphasize the state’s rural
cowboy heritage and being on the cutting edge of technology.</p>
<p>“You can go to the hall where it’s all the most amazing new cars and
maybe other exhibits about technology,” he said, “and then you can also
go and see the show cows.”</p>

id="columbias-president-resigns-after-months-of-turmoil-including-gaza-protests">Columbia’s
president resigns after months of turmoil, including Gaza protests</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Columbia University President Minouche Shafik resigned
Wednesday after a brief, tumultuous tenure that saw the head of the
prestigious New York university grapple with protests over the
Israel-Hamas war and criticism over how the school handled divisions
related to the conflict.</p>
<p>The school in upper Manhattan was roiled this year by student
protests, culminating in scenes of police officers carrying zip ties and
riot shields storming a building that had been occupied by
pro-Palestinian protesters. Similar protests swept college campuses
nationwide.</p>
<p>In addition to the protests, the school in July removed three deans,
who have since resigned, after officials said they exchanged disparaging
texts during a campus discussion about Jewish life and antisemitism.
Shafik said in a July 8 letter to the school community that the messages
were unprofessional and “disturbingly touched on ancient antisemitic
tropes.”</p>
<p>Shafik was also among the university leaders called for questioning
before Congress earlier this year. She was heavily criticized by
Republicans who accused her of not doing enough to combat concerns about
antisemitism on Columbia’s campus.</p>
<p>In her letter announcing her resignation, Shafik heralded “progress
in a number of important areas” but lamented that her tenure had also
been a “period of turmoil where it has been difficult to overcome
divergent views across our community.” In her statement, she
acknowledged the campus protests factored into her decision to
resign.</p>
<p>“This period has taken a considerable toll on my family, as it has
for others in the community,” Shafik wrote. “Over the summer, I have
been able to reflect and have decided that my moving on at this point
would best enable Columbia to traverse the challenges ahead.”</p>
<p>Shafik said she will return to the United Kingdom to lead an effort
by the foreign secretary’s office reviewing the government’s approach to
international development and how to improve capability.</p>
<p>“I am very pleased and appreciative that this will afford me the
opportunity to return to work on fighting global poverty and promoting
sustainable development, areas of lifelong interest to me,” she wrote.
“It also enables me to return to the House of Lords to reengage with the
important legislative agenda put forth by the new UK government.”</p>
<p>The Board of Trustees announced that Katrina Armstrong, the CEO of
Columbia University Irving Medical Center, agreed to serve as interim
president. The board said Armstrong, who is also the executive vice
president for the university’s Health and Biomedical Sciences, “is the
right leader for this moment.”</p>
<p>Armstrong said she was “deeply honored” to be leading the university
at a “pivotal moment for Columbia.”</p>
<p>“Challenging times present both the opportunity and the
responsibility for serious leadership to emerge from every group and
individual within a community,” Armstrong wrote. “This is such a time at
Columbia. As I step into this role, I am acutely aware of the trials the
University has faced over the past year.”</p>
<p>Shafik was named president of the university last year and was the
first woman to take on the role, and she was one of several women newly
appointed to take the reins at Ivy League institutions.</p>
<p>She had previously led the London School of Economics and before that
worked at the World Bank, where she rose through the ranks to become the
bank’s youngest-ever vice president. Shafik also worked at the United
Kingdom’s Department for International Development, followed by stints
at the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England.</p>
<p>At the time of Shafik’s appointment, Columbia Board of Trustees chair
Jonathan Lavine described her as a leader who deeply understood “the
academy and the world beyond it.”</p>
<p>“What set Minouche apart as a candidate,” Lavine had said in a
statement, “is her unshakable confidence in the vital role institutions
of higher education can and must play in solving the world’s most
complex problems.”</p>

On iOS 18, when you are editing a screenshot you just took, there is
automatic image snapping to things that feel like natural snapping
points.

<p>
Like window edges.

<p>There are two ways to configure inlets to expose an Ingress

similar, only the lifecycle of the tunnel differs.</p>

<h2 id="wal-g-3.0.3-released">WAL-G 3.0.3 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-15, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
WAL-G team is happy to announce the release of WAL-G 3.0.3
</p>
<p>
WAL-G is a tool for archival database restoration for PostgreSQL,
GreenplumDB, MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB, etcd and several other databases.
</p>
<p>
Major feature of this release is full support for OrioleDB. WAL-G
supported block-level incremental backups since
<a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/releases/tag/v0.1.3">v0.1.3</a>,
but it previously treated OrioleDB data as a collection of unknown
files. Now WAL-G understands if OrioleDB is installed into cluster and
makes efficient backup copies of OrioleDB data. Thanks to Supabase
engineers for working on WAL-G.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, this release includes two new commands for Postgres:
<code>catchup-send</code> and <code>catchup-receive</code>. These
commands are useful when you need to bring a lagging replica up to date
without pushing a new backup to the storage. In essence, they work like
pg_rewind but in reverse. Perhaps we should rename them to pg_wind.
</p>
<p>
This release also mitigates several CVEs in dependencies
(<a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/pull/1675">CVE-2023-39325</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/pull/1715">GHSA-9763-4f94-gfch</a>)
and fixes assorted bugs.
</p>
<p>
WAL-G v3.0.3 is available for download on our
<a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/releases">GitHub releases
page</a>.
</p>
<p>
Have a nice day!
