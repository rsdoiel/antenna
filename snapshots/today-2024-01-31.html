<h2 id="us-bracing-for-cyber-onslaught-from-china">US Bracing for ‘Cyber
Onslaught’ From China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — China’s efforts to target U.S. critical infrastructure
pose an urgent threat that needs to be addressed now, according to a new
warning from one of Washington’s top law enforcement officials.</p>
<p>FBI Director Christopher Wray tells U.S. lawmakers that Chinese
government hackers are actively targeting America’s electrical grid,
wastewater treatment plants, gas pipelines and transportation
systems.</p>
<p>“The risk that poses to every American requires our attention — now,”
Wray said in prepared testimony, released ahead of a congressional
hearing Wednesday on competition with China.</p>
<p>“China’s hackers are positioning on American infrastructure in
preparation to wreak havoc and cause real-world harm to American
citizens and communities, if or when China decides the time has come to
strike,” Wray said.</p>
<p>The FBI director also alleged Beijing is running cyber campaigns to
limit U.S. freedoms, “reaching inside our borders, across America, to
silence, coerce, and threaten our citizens and residents.”</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington has yet to respond to a request for
comment.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s warning about China’s cyber efforts against U.S. critical
infrastructure is not the first from top level U.S. officials.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the FBI along with the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, and the Environmental
Protection Agency, or RPA, cautioned cyberattacks were posing “a real
and urgent risk to safe drinking water.”</p>
<p>CISA has also warned about threats from Chinese-manufactured drones,
warning they could access or steal sensitive information that could put
the U.S. security and health and safety at risk. </p>
<p>This past September, the commander of U.S. Cyber Command, said he
expected China to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to impact the
upcoming U.S. presidential elections.</p>
<p>“Russia, China, others are going to try to use this technology,”
General Paul Nakasone told an audience in Washington.   </p>
<p>CISA Director Jen Easterly also warned this past June that in the
event of a conflict with China, Beijing “will almost certainly use
aggressive cyber operations to go after our critical infrastructure, to
include pipelines and rail lines to delay military deployment and to
induce societal panic.”</p>

<h2 id="indieweb-carnival-digital-relationships">IndieWeb Carnival:
Digital Relationships</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
January is about to end. That means that January’s IndieWeb Carnival,
hosted by <a href="https://foreverliketh.is">foreverliketh.is</a>, is
also about to end. If you want to submit your entry on the topic of
<a href="https://foreverliketh.is/blog/indieweb-carnival-january-2024-positive-internalization/">Positive
Internalization</a> you should hurry up.
</p>
<p>
As mentioned previously on this blog I’m going to host the next month
and the topic for the month of February is going to be “Digital
relationships”. The meaning of the topic is intentionally vague but I
can think of at least three ways to interpret it.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The first is probably the most obvious: relationships between us human
beings that are lived primarily—or entirely—on the digital world.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The second is the relationship between us and the digital world itself.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The third is the growing trend of people having relationships with
digital creations such as AI fiends, boyfriends and girlfriends.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Those are three ways you can interpret the topic but don’t feel limited
to just those three. Go nuts and be creative. This site doesn’t have
pingbacks or webmentions so if you plan to participate send me a link to
your entry via email. I’m going to accept everything that’s sent to me
before March 1st and I plan to write at least one roundup post with your
links. Look forward to read your entries and don’t forget to spread the
word about the IndieWeb Carnival and if you want to get involved you can
still become a host yourself. Just claim your spot here

A judge has struck down Elon Musk’s compensation package at Tesla,
valued at nearly $56 billion. The judge in Delaware — where Tesla is
incorporated — called the amount “unfathomable” and said Tesla’s board
failed to meet its responsibilities to shareholders. Let’s unpack the
case. Plus: why prices for lithium are in free fall and how to build a
home without putting out loads of emissions.

<p>
Yesterday the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA,
<a href="https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20240130/biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-help-communities-reduce" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a>
that it will help local governments pay to install solar panels and
energy-efficient appliances like heat pumps in public buildings such as
hospitals, fire stations, and schools in the wake of disasters. It’s a
move that will help those communities become more energy independent and
resilient, while also reducing the emissions that are intensifying
weather-related disasters to begin with. Last year saw a record 28
disaster costing $1 billion or more in the United States, according to
the agency, which added that buildings account for nearly 40% of U.S.
greenhouse gas emissions.

<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/louisiana-cancer-alley-human-rights" target="_self">writes</a>
my colleague Jacob Lambert in Heatmap.
</p>
<p>
“The failure of state and federal authorities to properly regulate the
industry has dire consequences for residents of Cancer Alley,” said
Antonia Juhasz, a senior researcher on fossil fuels at Human Rights
Watch. “It’s long past time for governments to uphold their human rights
obligations and for these sacrifices to end.”

<li>More than 4 million lives lost to climate change</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
We’ve long known that climate change impacts human lives, but putting a
number on just how many people it has affected so far is a difficult
task. A new analysis, published as commentary in the journal Nature
Medicine, tries to do just that, and arrives at a breathtaking figure:
at least 4 million people have been killed by climate change since 2000.
And as Zoya Teirstein writes in Grist, that’s
<a href="https://grist.org/health/climate-change-has-killed-4-million-people-since-2000-and-thats-an-underestimate/" target="_blank">probably
an underestimate</a>.
</p>
<p>
“Climate change is killing a lot of people, nobody is counting it, and
nobody is moving in the direction of counting it,” Colin Carlson, a
global change biologist and assistant professor at Georgetown University
who wrote the commentary, told Teirstein. “If it were anything but
climate change, we would be treating it on very different terms.”

<p>
On Tuesday, the three largest heavy-duty truck makers in America —
Daimler Truck, Volkswagen subsidiary Navistar, and Volvo North America —
announced a new coalition called Powering America’s Commercial
Transportation that will advocate for governments and utilities to help
build more charging stations for electric trucks. There are only nine
charging stations in the country that can serve electric long-haulers,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/30/business/electric-vehicles-trucks.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writes</a>
Jack Ewing in The New York Times, and the truck companies argue that
without more support from federal and state governments they can’t
introduce more electric trucks to the market. This may, as Ewing notes,
also be a bit of a ploy to shift blame: earlier this month, more than 40
advocacy groups accused Daimler and Volvo of trying to get in the way of
stricter emissions regulations.

ChatGPT to port <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a> to
Linux. The code still runs on reasonably current Macs, but not the
latest. I really should be working on Linux not Mac. If it weren’t for
my dependence on Frontier, I would be. I actually think ChatGPT might be
a great programming partner for a meaty operating-system-like project

<h2 id="some-activities-are-harder-than-others">Some activities are
harder than others</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Some activities are harder than others
</h1>
<p>
Or, why <a href="2022-03-04_It_is_not_too_late_to_bake_bread">baking
bread</a> is easy compared to many other activities.
</p>
<p>
A recent conversation with
<a class="account" href="https://zirk.us/@Mayobrot" title="@Mayobrot@zirk.us"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Mayobrot">@Mayobrot</span></a> made me
think about the fear of doing things. I’m thinking that there are
activities that are inherently easier to perform than others because of
the natural environment. In speaking about them, however, we use
categories that do not differentiate between the two and so we transfer
our fears from one category to the other.
</p>
<p>
Here are some examples from my personal life: I think programming and
soldering and model planes are difficult activities because small
differences have big impacts. On the other hand, cooking or baking, or
taking care of plants are comparatively easy activities because small
differences often don’t have a large impact.
</p>
<p>
Take the question of how long you should bake bread. In my oven, with my
settings, it seems that anything between 30 min and 90 min results in
edible bread. The temperature can vary between 160°C and 220°C and if
I’m looking into the oven every now and then this results in edible
bread. Varying ingredients by ±10% and more results in edible bread.
</p>
<p>
The same is true for watering plants, potting plants and all that
connects to. Plants adapt. Errors don’t accumulate but instead they
average out. To much or too little water means it’s going to be OK on
average.
</p>
<p>
This is not how software works. Its bugs bugs bugs and they never
average out to a nice user experience.
</p>
<p>
When family asks me about bugs in programming, I tell them that the
problem is that we need to put everything into the program: gravity, air
resistance, the floor… In real life we don’t. Walking is easy because if
we push of harder we don’t yeet ourselves into the sun. We just bounce a
little higher and then we’re back on the ground. And we don’t fall
towards the centre of the Earth as in some 3d model glitch in a game.
No, the ground is always there. If we speed up, there’s friction to slow
us down again. So physics stabilizes many things.
</p>
<p>
Chemistry stabilizes many things, too. If we use up the oxygen in our
room, we don’t just go go go and then we die because the oxygen
concentration goes down slowly. We get less oxygen, we move slower, we
have more time to get out.
</p>
<p>
And biology stabilizes things, too. We call it homeostasis. You
exercise, burning up sugar. Sugar goes down, fat gets mobilized,
allowing your body to continue. And then there are a hundred feedback
loops for everything to keep your body from falling apart. Of course
eventually we all do, but still.
</p>
<p>
I guess what I really was trying to say is that there are some
activities like baking bread that seem hard because you think that
baking bread is probably related to model air-planes and if you struggle
with the tweezers and glue and all that, surely you will struggle with
the ingredients of that dish, too. But that is not so. Usually, you can
mess up ingredients pretty badly and results are still edible, or even
tasty! They might not be repeatable, but who cares if you’re not a chef
in a restaurant. It’s tasty and you eat it. It’s great.

<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Global shipper UPS announced Tuesday that it’s planning to eliminate
12,000 jobs over the next few months — most of them in management. While
shareholders love the phrases “trimming the fat,” “cutting costs” and
“right-sizing,” why are managers so often the targets? We’ll also hear
about a negated pay package for Elon Musk and the tough balancing act
for Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

What makes a Lotus, a Lotus? Anyone familiar with automotive history
would likely say it’s the coy “simplify, then add lightness” philosophy
that defined Colin Chapman’s scrappy sports car manufacturer and UK
Formula One legend. But last year, the company began shipping its
all-new electric SUV, the Eletre. It weighs 2600 kilograms. It’s built
in China. It has more settings than a high-end washing machine. It’s… an
SUV. Absolutely nothing about this car says “Lotus” — aside from the
many Lotus logos on it.

<h2 id="cfpbs-proposed-data-rules">CFPB’s Proposed Data Rules</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, updated: 2024-01-26, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
In October, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
<a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb-1033-nprm-fr-notice_2023-10.pdf">proposed
a set of rules</a> that if implemented would transform how financial
institutions handle personal data about their customers. The rules put
control of that data back in the hands of ordinary Americans, while at
the same time undermining the data broker economy and increasing
customer choice and competition. Beyond these economic effects, the
rules have important data security benefits.
</p>
<p>
The CFPB’s rules align with a key security idea: the
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-privacy">decoupling
principle</a>. By separating which companies see what parts of our data,
and in what contexts, we can gain control over data about ourselves
(improving privacy) and harden cloud infrastructure against hacks
(improving security). Officials at the CFPB have described the new rules
as an attempt to accelerate a shift toward “open banking,” and after an
initial comment period on the new rules closed late last year, Rohit
Chopra, the CFPB’s director, …

After the judge wisely balked at our Department of Justice’s naked
attempt to get Hunter Biden off with a slap on the wrist, the wayward
First Son/“smartest guy” Joe Biden knows has finally been indicted on
tax charges.   Interesting. Never mind the illegal foreign agency and
the illegal bribes (after all, those fall on […]

Journey</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: Miek Giebin blog</p>
<p>In the olden days with X11, you could just do x11-forwarding in SSH
and remote cut and paste would work. Now with Wayland, this is all
broken and supposedly “there are better ways of doing it”. One of those
is OSC52 support in terminals, but not in VTE based ones, like Tilix,
which is was my default terminal. (See
https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte/-/issues/2495 for the 5(!) year old
bug). So I wanted this to work, which meant changing terminal and
configuring Neovim - where the latter was way more complex, hard to
debug and reason about.</p>

Three AI insights for hard-charging, future-oriented smartypantses (31
Jan 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Three AI insights for hard-charging, future-oriented
smartypantses: A little bit of nonsensewatching for a Wednesday. Hey
look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009,
2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent
appearances, current writing projects, current reading Three AI insights
for hard-charging, future-oriented smartypantses (permalink) Living in
the age of AI hype makes demands on all of us to come up with
smartypants prognostications about how AI is about to change everything
forever, and wow, it’s pretty amazing, huh? AI pitchmen don’t make it
easy. They like to pile on the cognitive dissonance and demand that we
all somehow resolve it. This is a thing cult leaders do, too – tell
blatant and obvious lies to their followers. When a cult follower
repeats the lie to others, they are demonstrating their loyalty, both to
the leader and to themselves. Over and over, the claims of AI pitchmen
turn out to be blatant lies. This has been the case since at least the
age of the Mechanical Turk, the 18th chess-playing automaton that was
actually just a chess player crammed into the base of an elaborate
puppet that was exhibited as an autonomous, intelligent robot. The most
prominent Mechanical Turk huckster is Elon Musk, who habitually,
blatantly and repeatedly lies about AI. He’s been promising “full self
driving” Telsas in “one to two years” for more than a decade.
Periodically, he’ll “demonstrate” a car that’s in full-self driving mode
– which then turns out to be canned, recorded demo:
https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-video-promoting-self-driving-was-staged-engineer-testifies-2023-01-17/
Musk even trotted an autonomous, humanoid robot on-stage at an investor
presentation, failing to mention that this mechanical marvel was just a
person in a robot suit:
https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/elon-musk-tesla-robot-optimus-ai
Now, Musk has announced that his junk-science neural interface company,
Neuralink, has made the leap to implanting neural interface chips in a
human brain. As Joan Westenberg writes, the press have repeated this
claim as presumptively true, despite its wild implausibility:
https://joanwestenberg.com/blog/elon-musk-lies Neuralink, after all, is
a company notorious for mutilating primates in pursuit of showy,
meaningless demos:
https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-pcrm-neuralink-monkey-deaths/ I’m
perfectly willing to believe that Musk would risk someone else’s life to
help him with this nonsense, because he doesn’t see other people as real
and deserving of compassion or empathy. But he’s also profoundly lazy
and is accustomed to a world that unquestioningly swallows his most
outlandish pronouncements, so Occam’s Razor dictates that the most
likely explanation here is that he just made it up. The odds that
there’s a human being beta-testing Musk’s neural interface with the only
brain they will ever have aren’t zero. But I give it the same odds as
the Raelians’ claim to have cloned a human being:
https://edition.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/01/03/cf.opinion.rael/ The
human-in-a-robot-suit gambit is everywhere in AI hype. Cruise, GM’s
disgraced “robot taxi” company, had 1.5 remote operators for every one
of the cars on the road. They used AI to replace a single, low-waged
driver with 1.5 high-waged, specialized technicians. Truly, it was a
marvel. Globalization is key to maintaining the guy-in-a-robot-suit
phenomenon. Globalization gives AI pitchmen access to millions of
low-waged workers who can pretend to be software programs, allowing us
to pretend to have transcended the capitalism’s exploitation trap. This
is also a very old pattern – just a couple decades after the Mechanical
Turk toured Europe, Thomas Jefferson returned from the continent with
the dumbwaiter. Jefferson refined and installed these marvels,
announcing to his dinner guests that they allowed him to replace his
“servants” (that is, his slaves). Dumbwaiters don’t replace slaves, of
course – they just keep them out of sight:
https://www.stuartmcmillen.com/blog/behind-the-dumbwaiter/ So much AI
turns out to be low-waged people in a call center in the Global South
pretending to be robots that Indian techies have a joke about it: “AI
stands for ‘absent Indian’”:
https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/29/pay-no-attention/#to-the-little-man-behind-the-curtain
A reader wrote to me this week. They’re a multi-decade veteran of Amazon
who had a fascinating tale about the launch of Amazon Go, the “fully
automated” Amazon retail outlets that let you wander around, pick up
goods and walk out again, while AI-enabled cameras totted up the goods
in your basket and charged your card for them. According to this reader,
the AI cameras didn’t work any better than Tesla’s full-self driving
mode, and had to be backstopped by a minimum of three camera operators
in an Indian call center, “so that there could be a quorum system for
deciding on a customer’s activity – three autopilots good, two
autopilots bad.” Amazon got a ton of press from the launch of the Amazon
Go stores. A lot of it was very favorable, of course: Mister Market is
insatiably horny for firing human beings and replacing them with robots,
so any announcement that you’ve got a human-replacing robot is a
surefire way to make Line Go Up. But there was also plenty of critical
press about this – pieces that took Amazon to task for replacing human
beings with robots. What was missing from the criticism? Articles that
said that Amazon was probably lying about its robots, that it had
replaced low-waged clerks in the USA with even-lower-waged
camera-jockeys in India. Which is a shame, because that criticism would
have hit Amazon where it hurts, right there in the ole Line Go Up.
Amazon’s stock price boost off the back of the Amazon Go announcements
represented the market’s bet that Amazon would evert out of cyberspace
and fill all of our physical retail corridors with monopolistic robot
stores, moated with IP that prevented other retailers from similarly
slashing their wage bills. That unbridgeable moat would guarantee Amazon
generations of monopoly rents, which it would share with any
shareholders who piled into the stock at that moment. See the
difference? Criticize Amazon for its devastatingly effective automation
and you help Amazon sell stock to suckers, which makes Amazon executives
richer. Criticize Amazon for lying about its automation, and you clobber
the personal net worth of the executives who spun up this lie, because
their portfolios are full of Amazon stock:

Amazon Go didn’t go. The hundreds of Amazon Go stores we were promised
never materialized. There’s an embarrassing rump of 25 of these things
still around, which will doubtless be quietly shuttered in the years to
come. But Amazon Go wasn’t a failure. It allowed its architects to
pocket massive capital gains on the way to building generational wealth
and establishing a new permanent aristocracy of habitual bullshitters
dressed up as high-tech wizards. “Wizard” is the right word for it. The
high-tech sector pretends to be science fiction, but it’s usually
fantasy. For a generation, America’s largest tech firms peddled the
dream of imminently establishing colonies on distant worlds or even
traveling to other solar systems, something that is still so far in our
future that it might well never come to pass:

During the Space Age, we got the same kind of performative bullshit. On
The Well David Gans mentioned hearing a promo on SiriusXM for a radio
show with “the first AI co-host.” To this, Craig L Maudlin replied,
“Reminds me of fins on automobiles.” Yup, that’s exactly it. An AI radio
co-host is to artificial intelligence as a Cadillac Eldorado Biaritz
tail-fin is to interstellar rocketry. Hey look at this (permalink) The

<h2 id="us-could-jail-foreign-officials-under-new-bribery-law">US Could
Jail Foreign Officials Under New Bribery Law</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Anticorruption activists around the world have high hopes
for a new U.S. law that for the first time allows Washington to
prosecute foreign officials who receive bribes.</p>
<p>The law broadens the enforcement profile of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, which has long been used to punish companies that pay
bribes and their shadowy agents.</p>
<p>Such players come from the “supply” side of the illicit payment
equation — those paying the bribes. The new Foreign Extortion Prevention
Act (FEPA) targets the “demand” side: foreign government officials who
seek or accept payouts.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden signed the measure into law in December as part
of a National Defense bill.</p>
<p>Auwal Musa Rafsanjani, a longtime anti-corruption and human rights
advocate in Nigeria, hopes the change instills “some level of fear” in
public officials who now feel “impunity,” he said.</p>
<p>“Public officials will engage in all sorts of corrupt practices and
they will never be punished for anything,” said Rafsanjani.</p>
<p>“Every employee for every foreign government is now going to be on
notice that the weight of the U.S. government could come after them,”
said Scott Greytak, a director of advocacy at Transparency
International. “That is going to change behavior.”</p>
<p>But Mike Koehler, a professor at Southern Illinois University School
of Law, said the deterrent benefit of the FCPA has long been
overstated.</p>
<p>Koehler considers the new measure “tokenism” and instead favors
greater transparency and encouragement of other countries to enforce
their own laws to reduce bribery.</p>
<p>Cold War statute</p>
<p>The FCPA was drafted in response to mid-1970s revelations of payments
by large U.S. companies to foreign officials that surfaced through the
Watergate investigations.</p>
<p>While barring U.S. companies from making such payments, the 1977 FCPA
statute, enacted during the Cold War, barred prosecution of officials
with foreign governments because of concerns it could hinder U.S.
diplomatic priorities.</p>
<p>Over time, the Justice Department has still managed to target corrupt
foreign officials under other statutes, such as money laundering.</p>
<p>Among the biggest FCPA cases in recent years, Goldman Sachs in
October 2020 paid $2.9 billion in a U.S. deferred prosecution agreement
over bribes to Malaysian and Abu Dhabi officials to win business.</p>
<p>Rafsanjani has pointed to a sprawling prosecution by the DOJ and
other countries of a four-company consortium that won some $6 billion in
contracts to build liquefied natural gas facilities in Bonny Island,
Nigeria.</p>
<p>The case included a $402 million criminal file on Halliburton unit
KBR in 2009. But Nigerian officials were not jailed in the case.</p>
<p>“What needs to be done is for countries like the U.S. to be in
alliance with other countries,” said Rafsanjani, who is working to
publicize FEPA within Nigerian agencies.</p>
<p>No quick fix</p>
<p>Research by Transparency International suggests the challenge in
countering corruption.</p>
<p>The group’s annual “Corruption Perceptions Index” released Tuesday
showed more than two-thirds of countries scoring below 50 due to poorly
financed enforcement and other governance ills. Nigeria scored 25 on the
scale, with 100 the best.</p>
<p>Foreign policy concerns could continue to dissuade prosecutions even
with FEPA, note legal experts, who also say enforcement will be
difficult if governments are unwilling to extradite defendants.</p>
<p>Supporters of FEPA see it as a way to make fighting corruption a
priority. The law requires the Justice Department to report annually on
the frequency of bribes and its enforcement record.</p>
<p>FEPA puts fighting corruption “front and center,” said Patrick
Stokes, who prosecuted the Bonny Island case while at DOJ and now is a
partner at Gibson Dunn.</p>
<p>“As a practical matter the new statute only marginally expands DOJ’s
tools for going after corruption,” he said, noting that money laundering
laws can be used to prosecute foreign officials.</p>
<p>“The statue may have real deterrence value by making clearer to
foreign officials that they can be prosecuted for soliciting and
accepting bribes,” Stokes said.</p>
<p>Jason Linder, a former U.S. prosecutor who now works at Mayer Brown,
said the demand side “has remained robust because corruption is endemic
in some countries,” and existing enforcement in developed countries only
reaches a “very small percentage of corrupt conduct.”</p>
<p>While FEPA is a “very constructive step,” Linder said, “it remains to
be seen how DOJ will enforce it.”</p>
<p>Success, he said, will have to be measured “over the coming decades,
not just the next few years.”</p>

id="musk-cannot-keep-tesla-pay-package-worth-more-than-55-billion-judge-rules">Musk
Cannot Keep Tesla Pay Package Worth More Than $55 Billion, Judge
Rules</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DOVER, Del. — Elon Musk is not entitled to a landmark compensation
package awarded by Tesla’s board of directors that is potentially worth
more than $55 billion, a Delaware judge ruled Tuesday.</p>
<p>The ruling by Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick comes more than
five years after a shareholder lawsuit targeted Tesla CEO Musk and
directors of the company. They were accused of breaching their duties to
the maker of electric vehicles and solar panels, resulting in a waste of
corporate assets and unjust enrichment for Musk.</p>
<p>The shareholder’s lawyers argued that the compensation package should
be voided because it was dictated by Musk and was the product of sham
negotiations with directors who were not independent of him. They also
said it was approved by shareholders who were given misleading and
incomplete disclosures in a proxy statement.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys countered that the pay plan was fairly negotiated
by a compensation committee whose members were independent, contained
performance milestones so lofty that they were ridiculed by some Wall
Street investors, and blessed by a shareholder vote that was not even
required under Delaware law. They also argued that Musk was not a
controlling shareholder because he owned less than one-third of the
company at the time.</p>
<p>An attorney for Musk and other Tesla defendants did not immediately
respond to an email seeking comment.</p>
<p>But Musk reacted to the ruling on X, the social media platform
formerly known as Twitter that he owns, by offering business advice.
“Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware,” he said. He
later added, “I recommend incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer
shareholders to decide matters.”</p>
<p>Musk, who as of Tuesday topped Forbes’ list of the world’s richest
people, had earlier this month challenged Tesla’s board to come up with
a new compensation plan for him that would give him a 25% stake in the
company. On an earnings call last week, Musk, who holds 13%, explained
that with a 25% stake, he can’t control the company, yet he would have
strong influence.</p>
<p>In trial testimony in November 2022, Musk denied that he dictated
terms of the compensation package or attended any meetings at which the
plan was discussed by the board, its compensation committee, or a
working group that helped develop it.</p>
<p>McCormick determined, however, that because Musk was a controlling
shareholder with a potential conflict of interest, the pay package must
be subject to a more rigorous standard.</p>
<p>“The process leading to the approval of Musk’s compensation plan was
deeply flawed,” McCormick wrote in the colorfully written 200-page
decision. “Musk had extensive ties with the persons tasked with
negotiating on Tesla’s behalf.”</p>
<p>McCormick concluded that the only suitable remedy was for Musk’s
compensation package to be rescinded.</p>
<p>Greg Varallo, a lead attorney for the shareholder plaintiff, praised
McCormick’s decision to reverse the “absurdly outsized” Musk pay
package.</p>
<p>“The fact that they lost this in Delaware court, it’s a jaw dropper,”
said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. “It’s unprecedented, a ruling
like this. I think going in investors thought it was just typical legal
noise and nothing was going to come out about it. The fact that they
went head-to-head with Tesla and Musk and the board and voided this,
it’s a huge legal decision.”</p>
<p>During his trial testimony, Musk downplayed the notion that his
friendships with certain Tesla board members, including sometimes
vacationing together, meant that they were likely to do his bidding.</p>
<p>The plan called for Musk to reap billions if Tesla, which is based in
Austin, Texas, hit certain market capitalization and operational
milestones. For each incidence of simultaneously meeting a market cap
milestone and an operational milestone, Musk, who owned about 22% of
Tesla when the plan was approved, would get stock equal to 1% of
outstanding shares at the time of the grant. His interest in the company
would grow to about 28% if the company’s market capitalization grew by
$600 billion.</p>
<p>Tesla has achieved all 12 market capitalization milestones and 11
operational milestones, providing Musk nearly $28 billion in stock
option gains, according to a January post-trial brief filed by the
plaintiff’s attorneys. The stock option grants are subject to a
five-year holding period, however.</p>
<p>Defense attorney Evan Chesler argued at trial that the compensation
package was a “high-risk, high-reward” deal that benefited not just
Musk, but Tesla shareholders. After the plan was implemented, the value
of the company, based in Austin, Texas, climbed from $53 billion to more

id="kimchi-consumption-grows-thanks-to-k-content-health-claims">Kimchi
Consumption Grows, Thanks to K-Content, Health Claims</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — South Korean kimchi exports hit a record high amid a
global surge in the popularity of Korean culture, hitting 44,041 tons in
2023, a 7.1% increase from 42,544 tons exported in 2021. </p>
<p>Kimchi, a traditional Korean dish made by fermenting cabbage or other
vegetables, was exported to 92 countries from South Korea last year,
with the United States and Japan being the top customers, according to
BusinessKorea, a monthly magazine.  </p>
<p>The United States imported more than 10,000 tons of kimchi in 2023,
and Japan imported more than 20,000 tons. Kimchi exports to the United
States have grown significantly in the past few years, increasing from
$14.8 million in 2019 to $29 million in 2022, according to The Korea
Daily. </p>
<p>Some experts see a connection between this rise in exports and the
rising popularity of Korean entertainment content, such as K-pop and
K-dramas. According to Forbes, U.S. viewership of Korean dramas rose
200% from 2019 to 2021, with TV shows like “Squid Game” topping the
Netflix viewership charts in the United States.  </p>
<p>Others attribute the rising popularity of kimchi to its health
benefits, as fermented foods expand the diversity of digestive tract
microbes.  </p>
<p>Patrice Cunningham, founder and CEO of Tae-Gu Kimchi in Washington,
spoke about the increase in popularity of kimchi in the United
States. </p>
<p>“Kimchi is a huge part of the Korean diet,” she said. “They eat it as
a side dish with almost every meal. … In the states now, we’re kind of
implementing that same style of eating.”  </p>
<p>Cunningham makes and distributes kimchi with her mother, selling both
vegan and non-vegan varieties made from napa cabbage.  </p>
<p>“I always knew that my mom had a really great kimchi recipe, and I
remember saying to myself for a while that I wanted to bottle it one day
and sell it,” Cunningham said.  </p>
<p>She attends 15 to 16 farmers markets a week in the main season and
has won multiple grants for her business, contributing to its
growth. </p>
<p>She said many of their customers focus on their “gut health … and so
they buy our kimchi for that.”   </p>
<p>K-culture boosts popularity</p>
<p>Another Washington business that sells kimchi is Rice Market. Partner
Sak Pollert said kimchi sales have increased significantly over the past
two years.  </p>
<p>He said more customers come in “with recipes on their phone, looking
for Korean and other Asian ingredients, too.”   </p>
<p>As to kimchi’s rise in popularity, particularly in the United States,
Pollert said that many in Washington are world travelers already
familiar with kimchi but don’t like the smell.  </p>
<p>“But now, they learned it’s probiotic foods that taste good and help
with digestion,” he said. “It helps make other foods taste better, so
they get over the smell quickly.”  </p>
<p>Pollert said he thinks that K-content has played an important role in
bolstering kimchi’s global popularity. K-dramas “did a phenomenal job
promoting kimchi and Korean food and drinks, especially soju,” a Korean
grain-based alcohol.  </p>
<p>He noted that restaurant and dinner scenes in many K-dramas feature
ajummas — Korean for married or middle-aged women — gathering around a
table to gossip and make kimchi before winter.  </p>
<p>South Korea promotes its cuisine </p>
<p>This rise in popularity of kimchi, though influenced by multiple
factors, is a part of a broader plan by the South Korean government to
push Korean cuisine worldwide.  </p>
<p>“South Korea’s government and corporations are thinking of ways to
promote Korean food and profit from it,” National Public Radio’s Anthony
Kuhn said in an interview with Yang Joo-Pil, an official at the South
Korean Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs.  </p>
<p>Yang said that each year, about 10 food items are chosen for product
placement in popular dramas, and Korean foods are sold at K-pop
concerts. </p>
<p>In Washington, efforts to promote Korean food and spread Korean
culture are evident in the work of the Korean Cultural Center. Last
November, the center partnered with Tae-Gu Kimchi for “DC’s First
Kimjang: Making and Sharing Kimchi.”  </p>
<p>Kimjang in Korea is an event that occurs once or twice a year “as a
way for communities to collectively stock up on and share essential
foods,” according to the Korean Cultural Center’s event page.  </p>
<p>At the kimjang event, participants had the opportunity to try kimchi
over rice and make their own kimchi in a hands-on workshop.</p>

<h2 id="iran-wary-of-us-response-after-deadly-attack-on-troops">Iran
Wary of US Response After Deadly Attack on Troops</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Tehran, Iran — Iranian commentators warned Tuesday of a U.S. military
retaliation after Washington pledged a “very consequential” response to
troop deaths, but largely agreed that a full-blown war was not in the
offing.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden blamed “radical Iran-backed militant groups
operating in Syria and Iraq” for Sunday’s drone strike on a remote
Jordan desert base near Syria and Iraq that killed three U.S.
soldiers.</p>
<p>The first American military deaths in an attack since the October 7
outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war have ratcheted up tensions between the
long-time enemies at the start of a U.S. election year.</p>
<p>Longtime foes Washington and Tehran have both been at pains to stress
they do not want war, so Biden’s warning has left Iranians guessing
about the next move.</p>
<p>“The possibility that Biden will order direct attacks on Iranian
targets cannot be ignored,” political analyst Ahmad Zeidabadi wrote in
the Ham-Mihan newspaper.</p>
<p>But he said any U.S. attacks would more likely target “the bases of
Iranian forces in other countries.”</p>
<p>In a sign of heightened tensions, Iran’s rial slipped Tuesday to an
all-time low of around 580,000 to 600,000 to the U.S. dollar on the
black market.</p>
<p>The reformist Etemaad Daily newspaper also said it was “possible” the
Biden administration — under political pressure from the Republicans —
“will target limited but strategic targets inside Iran.”</p>
<p>“This scenario may spell the end of diplomatic efforts between Tehran
and Washington,” it said.</p>
<p>Some of Biden’s Republican rivals have urged a direct attack on Iran,
while the president said Tuesday that “a wider war in the Middle East”
was “not what I’m looking for.”</p>
<p>Iranian officials were quick to deny any links to the Jordan attack,
reiterating that Tehran also opposes an “expansion” of the conflict in
the region.</p>
<p>Warning against ‘vengeance’</p>
<p>Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said Tuesday the
solution to the crisis must be “political” and wrote on X that
“diplomacy is active in this direction.”</p>
<p>China and Russia, which have friendly ties with Iran, urged
de-escalation and restraint, and Beijing warned against a “cycle of
retaliation” in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Another reformist newspaper, Shargh, called a direct confrontation
“unlikely” and said “Tehran and Washington have already shown in the
past their ability to contain direct conflicts.”</p>
<p>The Iran Daily, in a more strongly worded editorial, warned that
Biden must “not be duped into a direct military attack on Iran to take
vengeance for a strike launched by a third party.”</p>
<p>“Any insane move will definitely instigate a proportionate response
from Iran which could lead to a full-blown war,” it said.</p>
<p>The United States and Iran have been bitter enemies since the 1979
Islamic Revolution.</p>
<p>Fears about Iran’s nuclear program have since led to punishing
international sanctions, while U.S. ally Israel has fought a shadow war
of killings and sabotage with Iran.</p>
<p>The United States and Israel accuse Iran-backed militant groups of
fighting proxy wars in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen, with the support
of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.</p>
<p>In 2020, former U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the killing of
revered Guards commander Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad.</p>
<p>Violence across the region has spiked since Palestinian militant
group Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, sparking the bloodiest-ever
Gaza war.</p>
<p>Iran has voiced support for Hamas and its allies — Hezbollah in
Lebanon and Yemen’s Houthis — but insisted that the militant groups are
acting independently.</p>
<p>It has also accused the United States of being an accomplice to
Israel’s “genocide” in Gaza.</p>
<p>British ambassador summoned</p>
<p>The killings in Jordan follow a spate of attacks on U.S. forces in
nearby Iraq and Syria, many claimed by the Iran-backed alliance Islamic
Resistance in Iraq.</p>
<p>Tehran on Tuesday summoned the British ambassador to protest an
unspecified “accusation” against the Islamic republic, after London said
Iran-aligned groups were behind the Jordan attack.</p>
<p>Britain, along with the United States, also imposed sanctions on a
network they allege targets Iranian dissidents.</p>
<p>Washington has repeatedly accused Iran of involvement in Red Sea
attacks by Houthi rebels and of “actively facilitating” attacks on U.S.
forces in other parts of the Middle East.</p>
<p>Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations, Amir Saeid Iravani, again
stressed Tehran’s position in a letter published by the official IRNA
news agency.</p>
<p>He wrote that no group affiliated with Iran’s armed forces, “whether
in Iraq, Syria or elsewhere … operates directly or indirectly under the
control of the Islamic Republic of Iran or acts on its behalf.”</p>
<p>The Etemaad newspaper judged that Washington “has no choice but to
increase pressure” on Israel to end the Gaza war.</p>
<p>The conservative Javan newspaper warned that U.S. involvement in a
regional conflict to support Israel would be a “perfect example of
betting on a losing horse.”</p>

<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
PgBouncer 1.22.0 has been released. The main feature this release adds
is support for the <code>DISCARD ALL</code> and <code>DEALLOCATE
ALL</code> commands when enabling prepared statement support in
transaction pooling mode (by setting
<code>max_prepared_statements</code> to a non-zero value). This is an
important improvement in the prepared statement support that clears the
road for us to be able to enable prepared statement support by default
in a future release.
</p>
<p>
Other than that this release contains some small improvements and
bugfixes, including improvements to our recommended SystemD
configuration files.

<h2 id="tesla-is-finally-doing-the-smart-obvious-thing">Tesla Is Finally
Doing the Smart, Obvious Thing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTIyNzM3MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyMjA3Njk3Nn0.M8P1ewyGF-PMVHY3iQ1riawlq2ZFO4PL2A-CEXoc1Gc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Elon Musk tried to soften the blow.
</p>
<p>
On a call with investors last week, the Tesla chief warned of a
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/tesla-earnings-call-model-y-3-cybertruck" target="_self">gap
year</a>” for the company. Its tremendous sales driven by the Model Y
crossover would slow, while Tesla’s promised next wave of success was at
least a year away. That phase would be powered by
“<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-plans-build-new-electric-vehicles-mid-2025-sources-2024-01-24/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Project
Redwood</a>,” a new platform on which Tesla would build a new, smaller
crossover starting in the middle of 2025.
</p>
<p>
It can’t come soon enough. Despite the company’s waning market
dominance, it’s still true that as Tesla goes, so goes the EV industry —
and frankly, the entire industry feels like it’s entering a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/energy-earnings-ge-nextera-tesla" target="_self">gap
stage</a>.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps you’ve heard that the EV vibes are bad. Over the past several
months, publications have reported that the world is entering an EV
slowdown, and executives like General Motors CEO Mary Barra have given
interviews
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgLdi5Ugp34" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warning</a>
of some EV winter. The emerging narrative is that buyer demand for
electric is weakening, and that just maybe the automakers got ahead of
themselves by racing to electrify their lineups. But
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/are-ev-sales-really-slowing-data" target="_self">as
Heatmap showed</a>, that notion is not quite correct.
</p>
<p>
There is worrying data, yes.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/pickup-trucks-sedans-ford-f150-lightning-tesla-model-3" target="_self">Truck
buyers</a>, for example, may not have the appetite for electric Ford
F-150s and Chevy Silverados to support a mass transition, at least not
yet. Lagging charging infrastructure in many parts of the country
certainly makes some potential buyers skittish. Yet the traditional
automakers’ electric woes arise from more banal concerns, such as rising
interest rates dinging <em>all</em> auto sales, and especially Musk’s
big price war. Tesla slashed its prices multiple times in 2023, forcing
the likes of Ford to do the same and lose money on its Mach-E electric
crossover, for example.
</p>
<p>
The numbers don’t support the case that consumer EV demand has fallen
off a cliff. Instead, it looks more like this particular stage of EV
development is coming to an end while the next one isn’t quite ready to
begin.
</p>
<p>
Just look at the electric vehicles on offer. Of the
<a href="https://evmagazine.com/top10/top-10-best-selling-electric-vehicles-in-the-us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">best-selling
EVs in America</a> that aren’t Teslas, most fit the mold of the
industry-leading Model Y, a sleek crossover with about 300 miles of
range, with a price tag in the neighborhood of $40,000. The Kia EV6,
Hyundai Ioniq5, Volkswagen ID.4, and Ford Mustang Mach-E landed in the
top 10 by following this pattern.
</p>
<p>
Heatmap’s Robinson Meyer has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/hyundai-motor-group-kia-motors-ioniq-5-ev-6" target="_self">noted</a>
that Hyundai and Kia, in particular, have cracked the code of this
particular EV moment by offering several varieties of electric (and
plug-in electric hybrid) crossover and SUVs in this price range to meet
America’s endless appetite for them. Seen in this light, Ford and GM’s
struggles are less about waning consumer demand for electrics and more
about the fact that Ford didn’t follow up the Mustang Mach-E by flooding
the zone with EV versions of the Edge, Explorer, and Escape.
</p>
<p>
As EVs continue to improve, Meyer noted, more people will go electric
not out of environmental concern or because of price shopping, but
simply because EVs will be better cars than their combustion
counterparts, cold stop. Yet there is another inescapable fact: No
matter
<a href="https://www.edmunds.com/car-loan/how-long-should-my-car-loan-be.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">how
long monthly payment plans get</a>, not everybody can afford a $40,000
car, electric or otherwise. (The shifting nature of federal tax credits
doesn’t help, nor does the tendency of the dealership system to slap on
thousands of dollars of bogus fees on top of the MSRP.)
</p>
<p>
The next phase of electrification is the true entry-level EV. Price is
the killer app, and nothing would reinvigorate EV demand in America like
the realization of Musk’s long-teased dream — a $25,000 vehicle that
could compete with
<a href="https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/rankings/compact-cars" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">compact
cars</a> like the Honda Civic and Mazda3, or even a $30,000 compact SUV
that would go up against the Toyota RAV4s and Honda CR-Vs that patrol
American suburbs.
</p>
<p>
This is, of course, maddeningly difficult to accomplish given battery
economics and the tremendous costs involved in designing and
manufacturing new vehicles. Tesla’s plan hinges on its
“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KD-8c9ri4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unboxed</a>”
manufacturing process that would slash the time its Gigafactories
require to build a new vehicle, thus making it more profitable to sell a
higher volume of cheaper cars.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/cybertruck-tesla-elon-musk" target="_self">As
I’ve argued</a>, Tesla could have been further along in this quest if it
hadn’t wasted so much time and attention on Musk’s pet distraction, the
Cybertruck. Indeed, the company’s future rests not in a stainless steel
lightning rod, but in the more boring reality of selling cars to
Americans that Hyundai and Kia have already figured out. Just give us
various sizes of not-that-different crossovers, and try to keep the
price down if you can.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to the Cybertruck distraction, and Musk’s adoration of the
whooshing sound deadlines make as they fly by, it will be some time
before Tesla’s car of the future can hit the road. It won’t doom the
company — Musk has delivered bad news during earnings calls before that

Tesla’s stock price</a>, but only temporarily. And when “Redwood”
finally arrives (along with the return of the much-beloved and
affordable Chevy Bolt), Tesla may yet again pull the industry along with
it.
</p>
<p>
If that means the start of a new phase, in which most Americans can
actually afford an EV, then it’ll be worth the delay.

<h2 id="us-syphilis-cases-rise-in-2022-most-in-70-years">US Syphilis
Cases Rise in 2022; Most in 70 Years</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — The U.S. syphilis epidemic isn’t abating, with the rate of
infectious cases rising 9% in 2022, according to a new federal
government report on sexually transmitted diseases in adults.</p>
<p>But there’s some unexpected good news: The rate of new gonorrhea
cases fell for the first time in a decade.</p>
<p>It’s not clear why syphilis rose 9% while gonorrhea dropped 9%,
officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said,
adding that it’s too soon to know whether a new downward trend is
emerging for the latter.</p>
<p>They are most focused on syphilis, which is less common than
gonorrhea or chlamydia but considered more dangerous. Total cases
surpassed 207,000 in 2022, the highest count in the United States since
1950, according to data released Tuesday.</p>
<p>And while it continues to have a disproportionate impact on gay and
bisexual men, it is expanding in heterosexual men and women, and
increasingly affecting newborns, too, CDC officials said.</p>
<p>Syphilis is a bacterial disease that can surface as painless genital
sores but can ultimately lead to paralysis, hearing loss, dementia and
even death if left untreated.</p>
<p>New syphilis infections plummeted in the U.S. starting in the 1940s
when antibiotics became widely available and fell to their lowest number
by 1998.</p>
<p>About 59,000 of the 2022 cases involved the most infectious forms of
syphilis. Of those, about a quarter were women and nearly a quarter were
heterosexual men.</p>
<p>“I think it’s unknowingly being spread in the cisgender heterosexual
population because we really aren’t testing for it. We really aren’t
looking for it” in that population, said Dr. Philip Chan, who teaches at
Brown University and is chief medical officer of Open Door Health, a
health center for gay, lesbian and transgender patients in Providence,
Rhode Island.</p>
<p>The report also shows rates of the most infectious types of syphilis
rose not just across the country but also across different racial and
ethnic groups, with American Indian and Alaska Native people having the
highest rate. South Dakota outpaced any other state for the highest rate
of infectious syphilis at 84 cases per 100,000 people — more than twice
as high as the state with the second-highest rate, New Mexico.</p>
<p>South Dakota’s increase was driven by an outbreak in the Native
American community, said Dr. Meghan O’Connell, chief public health
officer at the Great Plains Tribal Leaders’ Health Board based in Rapid
City, South Dakota. Most Nearly all of the cases were in heterosexual
people. O’Connell said STD testing and treatment was limited in isolated
tribal communities and only got worse during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services last year convened a
syphilis task force focused on stopping the spread of the STD, with an
emphasis on places with the highest syphilis rates — South Dakota, 12
other states and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>The report also looked at the more common STDs of chlamydia and
gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Chlamydia cases were relatively flat from 2021 to 2022, staying at a
rate of about 495 per 100,000, though there were declines noted in men
and especially women in their early 20s. For gonorrhea, the most
pronounced decline was seen in women in their early 20s as well.</p>
<p>Experts say they’re not sure why gonorrhea rates declined. It
happened in about 40 states, so whatever explains the decrease appears
to have occurred across most of the country. STD testing was disrupted
during the COVID-19 pandemic, and officials believe that’s the reason
the chlamydia rate fell in 2020.</p>
<p>It’s possible that testing and diagnoses were still shaking out in
2022, said Dr. Jonathan Mermin, director of the CDC’s National Center
for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention.</p>
<p>“We are encouraged by the magnitude of the decline,” Mermin said,
though the gonorrhea rate is still higher now than it was pre-pandemic.
“We need to examine what happened, and whether it’s going to continue to
happen.”</p>

<h2 id="patriotism-in-popular-music">Patriotism in popular music</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Patriotism in popular music
</h1>
<p>
Patriotism is a terrible topic for a song. That’s what makes me cringe
when I listen to Preciosa Puerto Rico by Marc Anthony. But when that
tempo change in the middle around the 3min mark comes up, it just makes
me want to get up and shout with jubilation! It is only later that I
wonder: what if this had been a German singing about Germany (substitute
your own boogeyman). 😩
</p>
<p>
I am convinced: patriotism is an illusion used to achieve something. It
might be something good, a national infrastructure project, but
inevitably it will be used for evil. But that song … ah, it melts my
heart!
</p>
<p>
Beware small-patriotism. It starts with homesickness, longing for the
places and culture you grew up in, which is valid, no doubt, but when
you add pride or that feeling of belonging to the mix, it starts getting
tricky. Who decides who belongs?
</p>
<p>
As a perpetual foreigner, that feeling of belonging always comes with an
exclusionary element, in my experience. The Swiss celebrate Switzerland,
and their independence from the Austrians and the Germans. The Austrians
celebrate Austria and think that the Slovenian road names have to go.
There’s always somebody on the other side of the fence. But I know
relatives in Portugal, France, Germany, Austria, Croatia, and there are
more relatives that I haven’t met. So yes, there can be as moment of
pride for living in a place where this or that works well, or where the
landscape is beautiful, or where you feel the people are nice, or the
food is good, a moment where you’re not thinking too hard about it all –
but that moment is fleeting, and the abyss is huge. Patriotism and
nationalism are not only about that fleeting moment.

Pi is planning a London IPO, but its CEO expects “no change” in
focus</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>The business arm of Raspberry Pi is preparing to make an initial
public offering (IPO) in London. CEO Eben Upton tells Ars that should
the IPO happen, it will let Raspberry Pi’s not-for-profit side expand by
“at least a factor of 2X.” And while it’s “an understandable thing” that
Raspberry Pi enthusiasts could be concerned, “while I’m involved in
running the thing, I don’t expect people to see any change in how we do
things.” ↫ Kevin Purdy at Ars Technica Expect changes in how they do
things.</p>

<h2 id="apple-vision-pro-review-magic-until-its-not">Apple Vision Pro
review: magic, until it’s not</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>A number of reviews for Apple’s new VR headset have been published,
but the only one I think is worth reading is, surprisingly, the one
published by The Verge. Both the written and video review are excellent,
and go into every possible little detail of the new device. Nilay Patel
concludes: The basic gist is that the Vision Pro is simply cumbersome
and unpleasant to use, exactly what many people have been suspecting
since the day it was unveiled. I’ve been asking a very simple question
on Mastodon nobody has been able to answer yet: is there anything you do
on your phone, laptop, or desktop, that the Vision Pro can do better,
easier, quicker? Now that the reviews are here, not even the people
using it can provide an answer. And think about that last point in the
list above. It’s a private computer that’s always looking at your
hands.</p>

<h2 id="us-takes-shot-at-islamic-states-cyber-operations">US Takes Shot
at Islamic State’s Cyber Operations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The United States is taking new steps to cut off efforts
by the Islamic State terror group to grow its virtual, self-declared
caliphate. </p>
<p>Washington on Tuesday unveiled sanctions against two Egyptian
nationals accused of providing IS leaders with cybersecurity training so
they could move funds via cryptocurrencies and expand the terror group’s
recruitment efforts. </p>
<p>Al-Mawji Mahmud Salim and his business partner, Sarah Jamal Muhammad
Al-Sayyid, are accused of creating an IS-affiliated online platform
known as the Electronic Horizons Foundation (EHF). </p>
<p>In a statement, the U.S. Treasury Department said Al-Mawji “has
provided technical support on computer applications” to IS leaders while
also using the platform to help guide the terror group’s supporters on
how to evade law enforcement scrutiny and raise money. </p>
<p>The statement accused Jamal of helping her partners by recruiting IS
members to join the EHF platform and by procuring web servers needed to
keep the platform online. </p>
<p>“Today’s actions disrupt ISIS’s ability to move funds, including
through the use of cryptocurrency, and leverage its online presence to
recruit and promote its terrorist ideology,” said Treasury Department
Undersecretary Brian Nelson, using another acronym for the terror
group. </p>
<p>The department also levied sanctions against Faruk Guzel, a
Turkey-based financial facilitator who helped funnel money to IS
operatives in Syria. </p>
<p>In a separate statement on Tuesday, the U.S. State Department said
the new designations and the resulting sanctions reinforce Washington’s
commitment to work with the more than 80 countries that are part of the
Counter ISIS Finance Group, which aims to disrupt the organization’s
global financial networks. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, IS launched a new campaign of violence called
“And Kill Them Wherever You Find Them,” which coincided with a double
suicide bombing that killed nearly 90 people near the tomb of a slain
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander in Kerman, Iran. </p>
<p>The most recent U.S. intelligence assessments estimate IS leadership
in Iraq and Syria has access to about $25 million in cash reserves, down
from as much as about $300 million following the collapse of its
physical caliphate in 2019. </p>
<p>A separate report from the Pentagon’s inspector general this past
November said the IS leadership in Iraq and Syria is “unable to meet its
financial obligations, particularly payments to family members of
deceased and imprisoned ISIS personnel.” </p>
<p>“ISIS also paid its leaders sporadically, probably several hundred
dollars a month, while missing payments for fighters, likely to extend
its limited financing,” the report said.</p>

Picture of Louisiana’s Cancer Alley Just Keeps Getting Worse</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTIyMjcxNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxMTYyOTY3N30.Tfpf7JvUB5khckaW8gOv_WYHQGcLZlkQttBcdqp3Z4E/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
For decades, oil and gas producers have built their facilities along an
85-mile stretch of the Mississippi River in Louisiana between Baton
Rouge and New Orleans. Today, that area is known as Cancer Alley.
</p>
<p>
A
<a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/01/25/were-dying-here/fight-life-louisiana-fossil-fuel-sacrifice-zone" target="_blank">report</a>
by Human Rights Watch released last week documents in painstaking detail
how lax oversight of Louisiana’s fossil fuel and petrochemical
industries contributed not just to devastating rates of cancer
diagnoses, but also to elevated incidence of birth defects and
respiratory ailments. The area is a
“<a href="https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G22/004/48/PDF/G2200448.pdf?OpenElement" target="_blank">sacrifice
zone,</a>” per the United Nations, in which the area’s Black residents
bear the brunt of harms created by nearby polluting industries.
</p>
<p>
“The failure of state and federal authorities to properly regulate the
industry has dire consequences for residents of Cancer Alley,”
<a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/01/25/us-louisianas-cancer-alley" target="_blank">said</a>
Antonia Juhasz, a senior researcher on fossil fuels at Human Rights
Watch. “It’s long past time for governments to uphold their human rights
obligations and for these sacrifices to end.”
</p>
<p>
The report, titled “We’re Dying Here,” brings a sharper focus to
reproductive complications linked to fossil fuel pollution. The region’s
rates of low birth weight and preterm birth are triple the United States
average, according to new data from Tulane University researchers. In
addition, chronic asthma, bronchitis, and persistent sinus infections
are also common. “It’s just like a death sentence, like we’re sitting on
death row waiting to be killed,” Sharon Lavigne, a St. James Parish
activist,
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/in-cancer-alley-advocates-look-abroad-for-help/" target="_blank">told</a>
a UN panel in 2021. “We are being a sacrifice zone for the state.”
</p>
<p>
The “Cancer Alley” nickname itself is nothing new, but the area has once
again been in the spotlight amid the Biden administration’s
consideration of 17 new export facilities for liquified natural gas. One
of those, the proposed $10 billion Calcasieu Pass 2 project, would be
built in Louisiana’s Cameron Parish, about a three-hour drive from the
Cancer Alley zone. Last week, the White House announced that it would
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-lng-exports-pause-young-voters-climate" target="_blank">pause</a>
the approval process for new LNG terminals to allow for an updated
review of their climate effects.
</p>
<p>
According to one former Environmental Protection Agency
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/23/louisiana-gas-export-hub-biden-climate-crisis" target="_blank">official</a>,
CP2 alone would add “an unbelievable amount of pollution.” Nonetheless,
as Human Rights Watch notes, “at least 19 new fossil fuel and
petrochemical plants [are] planned for Cancer Alley, including within
many of the same areas of poverty and high concentrations of people of
color.”<br/>

<p>The Russo-Ukrainian war might be at a strategic tipping point. The

power in Crimea is diminished. The future flow of Western aid may be
less certain. To address these challenges, the West might escalate
support for Ukraine’s military and signal firmness to Moscow.</p>

<h2 id="best-laptop-of-2024">Best laptop of 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
You might be confused by the title of this post. You might be wondering
why on earth am I writing about the best laptop of 2024. I never
reviewed products on this blog. There was no best laptop of 2023 post
nor a best laptop of 2022. And fear not, there won’t be a post about the
best laptop of 2024 either.
</p>
<p>
You see, this is not going to be a post about laptops. It’s going to be
a post about words, about generated content, and about SEO. It’s also
going to be an experiment because I’m a curious person and the inner
workings of search engines fascinate me.
</p>
<p>
I was listening to a tech podcast the other day and in it, they were
talking about the evolving landscape of the publishing industry with the
increasing trend of companies making AI-generated listicles in an
attempt to rank high on Google. And then you have things like the
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/28/24053882/arc-search-browser-web-app-ios">Arc
search browser</a> that will use Ai to generate summaries of the pages
they browsed on your behalf. The result is that you have Ai consuming
content written by Ai in an attempt to do… something? I’m not sure what
the end game is to be perfectly honest with you but I’m interested
because this all looks like a shit show.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, back to the best laptops of 2024. In that podcast, they
mentioned that one of the prime targets in the search results tech space
is, you guessed it, the first page of results for the query “best
laptops of 2024”. And while I was listening I thought “I wonder how high
can a stupid blog post get on that SERP if I don’t actually write
content that’s relevant to the query”.
</p>
<p>
And this is that post. I have no interest in laptops. I know nothing
about laptops. I don’t care about laptops. I don’t even know which
laptops came out in 2024. I do know people are interested in knowing
which laptop is the best laptop in 2024 which is why I just wasted some
of your time (I’m sorry) making you read a silly post about the best
laptops in 2024 that has nothing to do with laptops.
</p>
<p>
Will google pick this one up? Will I even reach the first page? Who
knows! But if for some reason you landed on this blog post searching for
the best laptop of 2024 send me an email. I promise you I’ll do my best
to help you figure out what’s the best laptop for you.

<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: David Rosenthal’s blog</p>
I apologize for the delay in posting but, as you will see, the post I
was working on grew rather long.<br /> <br /> It seems obvious that
doing crimes and writing the receipts to an immutable public ledger is
risky, but many criminals have been convinced that there is no risk
because cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are anonymous. Although there
are cryptocurrencies with anonymous transactions, such as Monero and
zCash, they are much more difficult to use and much less liquid than
pseudonymous cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. As many criminals have
discovered, without an unrealistically intense focus on
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/02/inadequate-opsec.html">operational
security (opsec)</a>, the identity behind the pseudonym can be revealed.
An entire industry has evolved to do these revelations, tracing the flow
of coins through their blockchains.<br /> <br /> Below the fold I
discuss the techniques and results of blockchain tracing, based on four
main sources:<br />

Greenberg’s book lays out the history of blockchain tracing technology,
starting from Sarah Meiklejohn <i>et al</i>’s 2013 paper entitled
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2504730.2504747"><i>A Fistful of
Bitcoins: Characterizing Payments Among Men with No Names</i></a>. Their
abstract reads:<br />
<blockquote>
Bitcoin is a purely online virtual currency, unbacked by either physical
commodities or sovereign obligation; instead, it relies on a combination
of cryptographic protection and a peer-to-peer protocol for witnessing
settlements. Consequently, Bitcoin has the unintuitive property that
while the ownership of money is implicitly anonymous, its flow is
globally visible. In this paper we explore this unique characteristic
further, using heuristic clustering to group Bitcoin wallets based on
evidence of shared authority, and then using re-identification attacks
(i.e., empirical purchasing of goods and services) to classify the
operators of those clusters. From this analysis, we characterize
longitudinal changes in the Bitcoin market, the stresses these changes
are placing on the system, and the challenges for those seeking to use
Bitcoin for criminal or fraudulent purposes at scale.
</blockquote>
Meiklejohn started from an observation by Satoshi Nakamoto.
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">Greenberg
quotes Nakamoto</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
“Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which
necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner,”
Satoshi wrote. “The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed,
linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same
owner.”
</blockquote>
Linking the inputs of multi-input transactions roughly halved the then
number of Bitcoin users. Meiklejohn then developed the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">“change
address” technique</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
When you pay someone 6 bitcoins from a 10-coin address, 6 coins go to
their address. Your change, 4 coins, is stored at a new address, which
your wallet software creates for you. The challenge, when looking at
that transaction on the blockchain as a sleuthing observer, is that the
recipient’s address and the change address are both simply listed as
outputs, with no label to tell them apart.<br /> <br /> But sometimes,
Meiklejohn realized, spotting the difference between the change address
and the recipient address was easy: If one address had been used before
and the other hadn’t, the second, totally fresh address could only be
the change address
</blockquote>
Meiklejohn’s first criminal case started when “Flycracker” raised funds
to mail Brian Krebs a baker’s dozen bags of
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">heroin
from Silk Road</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Flycracker had made it easy. By posting a Bitcoin address to the
cybercriminal forum, he’d given Meiklejohn a starting point. She simply
copied the thirty-four-character string into her blockchain software and
looked at the transactions at that address. After collecting 2 bitcoins
in donations at the address he’d posted, worth around $200 at the time,
a little over three-quarters of the money had been sent to another
address, with a third collecting the change. At a glance, Meiklejohn
immediately identified the change address and checked the money’s
destination against her database. Sure enough, the address was one of
the nearly 300,000 she had already tagged as belonging to the Silk Road.
Meiklejohn had just connected Flycracker’s address directly to the
source of the heroin he’d tried to use to frame Krebs.
</blockquote>
The first major cryptocurrency bust Greenberg recounts was the arrest of
Silk Road’s Dread Pirate Roberts in a San Francisco library. It
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">did
not depend upon these tracing techniques</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The FBI has described that cybersurveillance coup as the result of a
misconfiguration in the site’s use of the Tor anonymity software but has
been reluctant to ever officially explain that error in a courtroom.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">In
fact</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
it had been the IRS’s Gary Alford, sitting in his New Jersey home four
months earlier, who’d done the meticulous, unglamorous work that had led
to the case’s first real breakthrough. Alford had been using Google to
dig up the earliest online posts about the Silk Road on drug forums when
he’d found a curious artifact: Someone going by the name “altoid” had
posted to a site called the Shroomery in January 2011 recommending the
Silk Road’s just-launched dark web market as a source for drugs. Around
the same time, a user with the same handle had also asked for
programming help on a coding forum. On that page, altoid had listed his
email address: rossulbricht@gmail.com.
</blockquote>
Another IRS agent, Tigran Gambaryan, received a tip that Carl Force, one
of the DEA agents working on Silk Road, had used a fake ID to set up an
account at Bitstamp, a cryptocurrency exchange, and deposited a lot of
BTC He had cashed out $200K and, as Gambaryan
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">examined
his financial records</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
He found that Force had, in late 2013, paid off his home’s entire
mortgage, an outstanding loan of $130,000. He’d repaid, too, a $22,000
loan he’d taken out against his federal retirement account. He’d even
made a gift of tens of thousands of dollars to his local church, the
sort of largesse that, Gambaryan knew all too well, was tough to afford
on a federal agent’s salary. The numbers only got shadier from there:
Gambaryan found records of real estate investments in which Force had
listed his net worth as more than 1 million. That wealth was almost
entirely due, it became clear, to a massive influx of liquidated
bitcoins from cryptocurrency exchanges like Bitstamp and CampBX that had
flowed into Force’s bank accounts. The payments totaled $776,000 beyond
his $150,000 annual DEA salary over the two prior years that he’d worked
on the Silk Road case. With that ample financial padding, Force had then
retired from the DEA, just days before Gambaryan began to look into his
records.
</blockquote>
Gambaryan could get Force’s wallet addresses from the exchanges he used,
and he found an unencrypted message from DPR referencing a 525 BTC
payment to Force’s investigative alias, but he needed proof, So,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">Greenberg
writes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Despite having read Meiklejohn’s paper, he possessed none of the data
that she’d assembled over months of clustering Bitcoin addresses and
identifying them with test transactions. So he simply started copying
Bitcoin addresses from Carl Force’s account records—the ones he’d gotten
from exchanges such as CampBX and Bitstamp—and pasting them into the
search field on Blockchain.info, which displayed the entire blockchain
on the web. At first, the collections of garbled character strings
seemed meaningless to Gambaryan. But almost immediately, he could see he
was onto something. On September 27, 2013, just a few days before Ross
Ulbricht’s arrest, Gambaryan saw with a jolt of recognition that one of
Force’s CampBX addresses had received a 525-bitcoin payment—the magic
number that DPR had mentioned in his conveniently unencrypted message.
</blockquote>
Gambaryan manually followed the chains backward, from their inputs to
the outputs that caused them,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">until
finally</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Following the money at each of the remaining addresses back one more
step, he now saw the coins had originally come from just four sources.
Each of those addresses had received their funds on the same day: August
4, 2013—the exact date when the Dread Pirate Roberts had told Nob he’d
paid him. Gambaryan mentally recorded the payments: They were for 127,
61, 134, and 203 bitcoins. He added the numbers in his head. They summed
up to 525 bitcoins.<br /> …<br /> The next morning, after a few hours’
sleep, Gambaryan began texting his DHS contact Jared Der-Yeghiayan, the
Armenian American agent in Chicago whom he’d befriended. He needed to
check the four addresses he’d found with someone who had access to the
Dread Pirate Roberts’s Bitcoin wallet. As a member of the Silk Road
investigation team, Der-Yeghiayan still had access to all the site’s
server data, including its Bitcoin addresses. Der-Yeghiayan called
Gambaryan back a few hours later and confirmed what Gambaryan already
knew: Each of the four addresses belonged to DPR.
</blockquote>
He thus became apparently the first law enforcer to use blockchain
tracing as evidence in an investigation. Its first use in a trial
appears to be when, with help from Nick Weaver, the prosecution of Ross
Ulbricht introduced a trace of his payment for
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">
a murder-for-hire attempt</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
But the day when the prosecution found the incontrovertible, public, and
unerasable proof of Ulbricht’s Silk Road millions, argues Nick Weaver,
remains a milestone in the history of cryptocurrency and crime. “That is
the date,” Weaver says, “that you can state unequivocally that law
enforcement learned that the blockchain is forever.”
</blockquote>
The blockchain tracing industry’s pioneer, Chainalysis, spun out of the
Kraken exchange as a result of the next big crime Greenberg covers, the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">collapse
of the Mt. Gox exchange</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Kraken’s management, in a pro bono attempt to help rescue the
cryptocurrency ecosystem from the rippling shock of Mt. Gox’s
failure—and the collapse in Bitcoin’s price that followed—had agreed to
help distribute any remaining bitcoins that could be found to Mt. Gox’s
thousands upon thousands of angry creditors.<br /> <br /> Michael
Gronager, for his part, had taken on a far more uncertain task. He’d
agreed to find the missing coins. By all appearances, this was not a
rational decision. The Danish entrepreneur had left his relatively
comfortable position as the COO of Kraken to found a new start-up whose
sole client, for the moment, was this roomful of Japanese bankruptcy
lawyers asking him to track down Mt. Gox’s gigantic, wayward fortune.
Even calling them a client would be a stretch: He would receive no fee,
and no portion of the recovered funds, if he could manage to find any.
</blockquote>
The co-evolution of Bitcoin’s and tracing technology started with the
revelation that Chainalysis, by running a node in the Bitcoin network,
could discover the IP address associated with many wallets, which
garnered both hostility and customers. With a head-start, Chainalysis
rapidly became the leader in their emerging market, as
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Increasing-Returns-Dependence-Economics-Cognition/dp/0472064967">Brian
Arthur</a> would have predicted.<br /> <br /> The next investigation
Greenberg covers was into the BTC-e exchange,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">whose</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
computers where the exchange was hosted weren’t on the dark web,
protected by Tor. They ought to be discoverable with a simple
“traceroute” command, an operation that anyone with a computer and an
internet connection can run to find a site’s IP address—no harder than
looking up a commercial service’s number in a phone book. Gambaryan
checked, and it turned out the only layer of misdirection that had
prevented curious observers from learning the location of BTC-e’s
servers in the first place was a company called Cloudflare, a web
infrastructure provider and security service that shielded the
exchange’s IPs from prying eyes like Gambaryan’s.
</blockquote>
Subpoenas to Cloudflare revealed they were hosted in the US, which
allowed them to be
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">imaged</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Gambaryan dug into the data his team had copied from the BTC-e server.
What he found was a revelation: The IP address for the account trading
in stolen Mt. Gox coins on BTC-e matched one of the few IP addresses on
the BTC-e server’s allow list for the administrators’ connections. In
other words, the person who had siphoned hundreds of thousands of
bitcoins from Mt. Gox into BTC-e wasn’t just any BTC-e user. They were a
BTC-e administrator. Specifically, an admin with the username WME. “The
gears started turning in my head,” Gambaryan remembers. “What better way
to launder hundreds of thousands of bitcoins than to launch your own
Bitcoin exchange?”
</blockquote>
WME was Alexander Vinnik but, alas, he was in Russia.<br /> <br />
Greenberg goes on to describe the takedown of Alexandre Cazes, who ran
the Alphabay dark-web market and the related takeover of the Hansa
dark-web market, and then of the Welcome to Video child sexual abuse
site. This led to the arrest and indictment of a Texas-based
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">Border
Patrol agent</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The Texas man had taken a rare approach to his legal defense: He’d
pleaded guilty to possession of child sexual abuse materials, but he
also appealed his conviction. He argued that his case should be thrown
out because IRS agents had identified him by tracking his Bitcoin
payments—without a warrant—which he claimed violated his Fourth
Amendment right to privacy and represented an unconstitutional
“search.”<br /> <br /> A panel of appellate judges considered the
argument—and rejected it. In a nine-page opinion, they explained their
ruling, setting down a precedent that spelled out in glaring terms
exactly how far from private they determined Bitcoin’s transactions to
be.<br /> <br /> “Every Bitcoin user has access to the public Bitcoin
blockchain and can see every Bitcoin address and its respective
transfers. Due to this publicity, it is possible to determine the
identities of Bitcoin address owners by analyzing the blockchain,” the
ruling read. “There is no intrusion into a constitutionally protected
area because there is no constitutional privacy interest in the
information on the blockchain.”<br /> <br /> A search requires a
warrant, the American judicial system has long held, only if that search
enters into a domain where the defendant has a “reasonable expectation
of privacy.” The judges’ ruling argued that no such expectation should
have existed here: The HSI agent wasn’t caught in the Welcome to Video
dragnet because IRS agents had violated his privacy. He was caught, the
judges concluded, because he had mistakenly believed his Bitcoin
transactions to have ever been private in the first place.
</blockquote>
This firmly established blockchain tracing as a legitimate form of
evidence.<br /> <br />

One case Greenberg mentions only in passing is the theft of nearly 120K
BTC from Bitfinex, to which
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66390639">Heather Morgan

suspects during the takeover of AlphaBay that Greenberg describes in

this case. The two VCE4 accounts used Russian e-mail addresses, but the
VCE7 and VCE8 accounts were in the name of companies controlled by
Lichtenstein and Morgan. Tracing the chains back connected the VCE4
accounts to the suspects, who had taken the precaution of funding VCE4

Deanonymizing individual wallets and flows is valuable to Chainalysis’
clients; law enforcement for evidence and financial institutions for
risk-assessment. But their vast collection of tagged wallet addresses
and transactions is also valuable in aggregate. It enables statistical
analysis of the cryptosphere, such as Chainalysis’ annual report on
cryptocurrency crime. This year’s is introduced in
<a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/"><i>2024
Crypto Crime Trends: Illicit Activity Down as Scamming and Stolen Funds
Fall, But Ransomware and Darknet Markets See Growth</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
2023 saw a significant drop in value received by illicit cryptocurrency
addresses, to a total of $24.2 billion. As always, we have to caveat by
saying that these figures are lower bound estimates based on inflows to
the illicit addresses we’ve identified today. One year from now, these
totals will almost certainly be higher, as we identify more illicit
addresses and incorporate their historic activity into our estimates.
For instance, when we published our Crypto Crime Report last year, we
estimated $20.6 billion worth of illicit transaction volume for 2022.
One year later, our updated estimate for 2022 is $39.6 billion. Much of
that growth came from the identification of previously unknown, highly
active addresses hosted by sanctioned services, as well as our addition
of transaction volume associated with services in sanctioned
jurisdictions to our illicit totals.<br /> <br /> Another key reason the
new total is so much higher, besides the identification of new illicit
addresses: We’re now counting the $8.7 billion in creditor claims
against FTX in our 2022 figures. In last year’s report,
</blockquote>
Although these arae large sums, Chainalysys estimate they represent a
fairly small proportion of the total cryptocurrency volume, falling from
0.42% in 2022 to 0.34% in 2023. Of course, it is unlikely that they have
identified <i>all</i> the illicit transactions.<br /> <br />

The report has a
<a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/">big
surprise</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Through 2021, Bitcoin reigned supreme as the cryptocurrency of choice
among cybercriminals, likely due to its high liquidity. But that’s
changed over the last two years, with stablecoins now accounting for the
majority of all illicit transaction volume. This change also comes
alongside recent growth in stablecoins’ share of all crypto activity
overall, including legitimate activity.
</blockquote>
Bitcoin’s volatility is great for speculation, but when it fails to
proceed moonwards it is a big problem for criminals, and
<a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/">especially
for sanctions-busters</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Some forms of illicit cryptocurrency activity, such as darknet market
sales and ransomware extortion, still take place predominantly in
Bitcoin. Others, like scamming and transactions associated with
sanctioned entities, have shifted to stablecoins. Those also happen to
be the biggest forms of crypto crime by transaction volume, thereby
driving the larger trend. Sanctioned entities, as well as those
operating in sanctioned jurisdictions or involved with terrorism
financing, also have a greater incentive to use stablecoins, as they may
face more challenges accessing the U.S. dollar through traditional
means, but still want to benefit from the stability it provides.
</blockquote>
The report notes that stablecoin users,criminal or not, run the risk of
having their wallets and thus their funds “frozen”, as Tether has been
doing recently. Patrick Tan covered the case of an Indian user (The
Victim) in detail in
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/what-happens-when-tether-freezes-your-tether-5a8ece2bd508"><i>What

into the deliberately confusing details and ends up agreeing with
<a href="https://datafinnovation.medium.com/3249639e677a">Jonathan
Reiter</a> about the The Victim’s problem:<br />
<blockquote>
On a basic level this user was relying on an unlicensed money
transmitter where they have 0 access to any authority that feels
accountable to them.<br /> <br /> Tether isn’t an Indian money services
business. Nor is it regulated in the victim’s country. Or anywhere with
a real process.<br /> …<br /> This — precisely this — is the cost of
living outside the law. You may end up with no recourse. Or not.<br />
<br /> But you don’t even have someone to complain to that feels
accountable for your problems (i.e. your local police or elected
representative, or an employee of a business accountable to a regulator
you can contact).

It turns out that evading sanctions is the
<a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/">major
criminal use case</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Perhaps the most obvious trend that emerges when looking at illicit
transaction volume is the prominence of sanctions-related transactions.
Sanctioned entities and jurisdictions together accounted for a combined
$14.9 billion worth of transaction volume in 2023, which represents
61.5% of all illicit transaction volume we measured on the year. Most of
this total is driven by cryptocurrency services that were sanctioned by
the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control
(OFAC), or are located in sanctioned jurisdictions, and can continue to
operate because they’re in jurisdictions where U.S. sanctions are not
enforced. <br /> <br /> While those services can and have been used for
nefarious purposes, it also means that some of that $14.9 billion in
sanctions-related transaction volume includes activity from average
crypto users who happen to reside in those jurisdictions. For example,
Russia-based exchange Garantex, which was sanctioned by OFAC and OFSI in
the U.K. for its facilitation of money laundering on behalf of
ransomware attackers and other cybercriminals, was one of the biggest
drivers of transaction volume associated with sanctioned entities in
2023. Garantex continues to operate because Russia does not enforce U.S.
sanctions. So, does that mean all of Garantex’s transaction volume is
associated with ransomware and money laundering? No. Nevertheless,
exposure to Garantex introduces serious sanctions risk for crypto
platforms subject to U.S. or U.K. jurisdiction, which means those
platforms must remain ever-more vigilant and screen for exposure to
Garantex in order to be compliant.
</blockquote>
Translation: platforms need to subscribe to Chainalysis to be safe. Andy
Greenberg’s
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/stablecoin-sanctions-violations-crypto-crime/"><i>‘Stablecoins’
Enabled $40 Billion in Crypto Crime Since 2022</i></a> quotes
Chainalysis’ Andrew Fierman:<br />
<blockquote>
As examples, Fierman points to Nobitex, the largest cryptocurrency
exchange operating in the sanctioned country of Iran, as well as
Garantex, a notorious exchange based in Russia that has been
specifically sanctioned for its widespread criminal use. Stablecoin
usage on Nobitex outstrips bitcoin by a 9:1 ratio, and on Garantex by a
5:1 ratio, Chainalysis found. That’s a stark difference from the roughly
1:1 ratio between stablecoins and bitcoins on a few nonsanctioned
mainstream exchanges that Chainalysis checked for comparison.
</blockquote>
Of course, when Chainalysis says “stablecoin” they essentially mean
Tether. Three years ago, this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKeMfxLV8K8">interview of
Charles Yang</a>, head trader of Genesis Block based in Hong Kong, by
John Riggins descibed how Tether was the basis for trade flows in
South-East Asia because it evaded governments’ currency controls.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKeMfxLV8K8">Yang
noted</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
bank acccounts are the absolute most valuable thing — you have to set up
a bunch of different companies, a lot of different bank accounts just to
facilitate trades that aren’t that big, maybe $50K. The moment you tell
them this is for a USDT trade, you’re basically asking them to shut your
bank account down.

The report details techniques such as
<a href="https://www.unodc.org/roseap/uploads/documents/Publications/2024/Casino_Underground_Banking_Report_2024.pdf">points-running
and motorcades</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
As third- and fourth-party payments have become better understood by
authorities and more widely reported following ‘Operation Chain Break’
and other measures in China, organized crime groups have responded by
accelerating the integration of cryptocurrencies into their illegal
betting operations, creating significant challenges for investigators.
In recent years, law enforcement and financial intelligence authorities
have reported the growing use of sophisticated, high-speed money
laundering ‘motorcade’ teams specializing in underground USDT – fiat
currency exchanges (卡接回U) across East and Southeast Asia. This has
also included the mass recruitment of mule bank accounts across
virtually all jurisdictions in the Asia Pacific region which can be
purchased for as little as US $30.<br /> <br /> Due to the rise of
cryptocurrency-integrated motorcades, points running syndicates, and
other challenges, in 2021 the Government of China banned cryptocurrency
transactions, trading, and mining. The industry subsequently migrated to
various jurisdictions, particularly driving up already rising
cryptocurrency adoption in several countries in Southeast Asia, together
with the establishment of high-risk and underground cryptocurrency
exchanges. At the same time, it is worth noting that cryptocurrency
flows connected to organized crime have been cited as being vastly
underestimated by industry experts as well as law enforcement and
regulatory authorities in the region. Experts have pointed to a number
of shortcomings related to existing analyses including massive gaps in
crime attribution on the blockchain, fabricated reporting by crypto
exchanges, and the prevalence of wash trading which inflates crypto
transaction volumes, thereby shrinking the portion of illicit
transactions identified.

<p>The US is rightly concerned that Tether is undermining their
sanctions system, but countries like China with strict controls on
cross-boarder currency flows are also worried about similar undermining.

Apple sold some 200,000 VisionPro. So at least 700 million dollars.

<p>
That assumes everyone went with the cheapest option without accessories.

If people go with the high end models, a battery and apple care the
total is 900million.

<p>
The new climate media startup Heatmap News is looking for an ambitious,
insightful reporter to lead its coverage of climate tech.
</p>
<p>
This writer will report to the editor-in-chief and be tasked with
reporting on the startups, venture capitalists, and technologies at the
bleeding edge of the energy transition.
</p>
<p>
Candidates should be intrepid, well-sourced reporters with a deep
interest in climate tech. They should have a proven ability to go beyond
press releases to report about the inner workings of startups, bringing
to light in vivid detail the opportunities and challenges faced by
companies as they grow.
</p>
<p>
A background in climate tech coverage is an obvious plus, but candidates
with deep experience in technology and business reporting will also be
considered.
</p>
<p>
Candidates should be passionate about Heatmap’s mission and absolutely
thrilled about building something from the ground up.
</p>
<p>
The salary minimum is $75,000 and the maximum is $95,000. Competitive
benefits, unlimited paid time off, and a generous equity plan, which
gives employees a real stake in the company, are also offered. This
position is remote. Candidates across the United States will be
considered, but extra consideration will be given to those near climate
tech hubs in the Bay Area or New York.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Interested candidates should send a brief cover letter and
resume to editors@heatmap.news.</strong>

<p>Last month Katherine called out the tension inherent in a “personal”
website which is that it is both public and personal, and one’s public
(or professional) persona is often different from that of their personal
life. Robin Rendle riffed on the concept and said that it’s totally fine
for personal websites to be messy or imperfect or weird (i.e., not
necessarily how you’d want to present a “professional” front) and
declared, in a pretty great and punchy/pithy statement, “You’re a poem
and not software”.</p>

China Launch Fentanyl Talks in Sign of Cooperation Amid Differences</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIJING — American and Chinese officials met Tuesday to discuss joint
efforts to stem the flow of fentanyl into the U.S., a sign of
cooperation as the two global powers try to manage their contentious
ties.</p>
<p>The two-day meeting was the first for a new counternarcotics working
group. One focus of the talks was fentanyl, the synthetic opioid that is
ravaging America, and in particular ingredients for the drug that are
made in China.</p>
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to restart cooperation in a
handful of areas, including drug trafficking, when he and U.S. President
Joe Biden met outside San Francisco in November. The agreements were a
small step forward in a relationship strained by major differences on
issues ranging from trade and technology to Taiwan and human rights.</p>
<p>The U.S. wants China to do more to curb the export of chemicals that
it says are processed into fentanyl, largely in Mexico, before the final
product is smuggled into the United States.</p>
<p>Chinese Public Security Minister Wang Xiaohong said the two sides had
in-depth and pragmatic talks.</p>
<p>“We reached common understanding on the work plan for the working
group,” he said at a ceremony marking the inauguration of the group.</p>
<p>The head of the U.S. team, Jen Daskal, a deputy homeland security
advisor in the White House, said that Biden had sent a high-level
delegation “to underscore the importance of this issue to the American
people.”</p>
<p>China used to be a major supplier of fentanyl, and the U.S. has
credited Beijing for a 2019 crackdown that led to “a drastic reduction
in seizures of fentanyl shipments … from China.” Now it wants Beijing to
stop the export of the ingredients known as “precursors.”</p>
<p>Synthetic opioids are the biggest killers in the deadliest drug
crisis the U.S. has ever seen. More than 100,000 deaths were linked to
drug overdoses in 2022, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. More than two-thirds involved fentanyl or
similar synthetic drugs.</p>
<p>China had previously rebuffed U.S. appeals for help as relations
between the two global powers deteriorated, often responding that the
U.S. should look inward to solve its domestic problems and not blame
them on China.</p>
<p>Talks were formally put on ice in 2022, when China suspended
cooperation in several areas including narcotics to protest a visit to
Taiwan by then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.</p>
<p>The ice began to thaw in the lead-up to the Biden-Xi meeting in
November 2023. A U.S. Senate delegation pressed the fentanyl issue on a
visit to Beijing in October and said that Chinese officials expressed
sympathy for the victims of America’s opioid crisis.</p>
<p>But China refused to discuss cooperation unless the U.S. lifted
sanctions on the Public Security Ministry’s Institute of Forensic
Science. The Commerce Department had imposed the sanctions in 2020,
accusing the institute complicity in human rights violations against
Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups in China’s Xinjiang
region.</p>
<p>The U.S. quietly agreed to lift the sanctions to get cooperation on
fentanyl. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi acknowledged “the removal of
the obstacle of unilateral sanctions” in a speech on China-U.S.
relations earlier this month.</p>
<p>State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller called it “an
appropriate step to take” given what China was willing to do on the
trafficking of fentanyl precursors.</p>

asking which networks people check first, which they get the most out
of. As you might expect, the most common answer was the network I was
asking on (except Facebook, no one answered there, I guessed that might
happen, because Facebook is different from the others). I asked because
I’m trying to figure that out for myself, and I’m kind of disappointed
that I find myself going to Threads more often. It has the greater
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Sweaty+Palms+Quotient">Sweaty
Palms Quotient</a>, the feeling I used to have every week in the 80s
when MacWeek or PC Week arrived. I always cleared the time to go through
each issue carefully to see what my friends and competitors were up to.
Then I would talk to my reporter friends, who wanted to know what I
thought, or what back-room perspectives I could share with them. This
was the time of the telephone, even before everyone had email, in the
tech industry, believe it or not. Anyway, this isn’t going the way I
hoped it would. For me an open network built on the idea of
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a> is what I want to
see, what I’m working towards. And seeing products like WordPress and
its competitors as full-class members of the social web, because they
already do textcasting, now all they need is to be hooked up to a social
web that understands that writing isn’t just
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+grunts+and+snorts">grunts
and snorts</a>. Anyway, it’ll give you some encouragement that people in
the fediverse are most optimistic about their preferred network being
the best of the new lot. I still like Bluesky, a lot, because of the
intelligence and creativity of the people who use it. And I like the UI,
for its simplicity and familiarity, but I’m concerned it’ll lose its
simplicity when they federate. And don’t count Twitter out yet, there’s
far more happening there than any of the other networks. And a lot of
what you read on the other nets is wishful thinking about the demise of
Twitter. Hasn’t happened yet, and my guess is it won’t. It’s really hard
to snuff out machines with the kind of momentum Twitter has, even though
Musk is doing his best. One more thing to think about, I don’t think
federation is what we need, I think we need
<a href="http://scripting.com/2014/03/21/theWebIsMadeOfInterop.html">interop</a>.
It’s a more permissive kind of compatibility, and will happen a lot
sooner than federation, which honestly, I don’t think ever will happen.
With the usual disclaimers, most important that I’m often wrong, and am
open to other constructive points of view.</p>

<h2>
THE TOP FIVE
</h2>
<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>U.S. finalizes stove efficiency rules<br/>
</h3>
<p>
Yesterday, the U.S. Department of Energy finalized energy efficiency
rules for both gas and electric stoves that the agency says will save
consumers around $1.6 billion in energy costs over 30 years, according
to
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-29/us-sets-rules-to-make-gas-and-electric-stoves-more-efficient?srnd=green" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>.
The standards, which are scheduled to take effect in 2028, won’t ban gas
stoves, but should reduce carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 4
million metric tons over three decades.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>A vast archive of climate data literally melts away
</h3>
<p>
Glaciers are treasure troves of information for scientists studying
climate change. Ice core analysis can often give researchers a detailed
look at the composition of the atmosphere over time, which in turn tells
us just how human-caused pollution affects the climate. The problem, of
course, is that climate change also makes glaciers melt — and now one of
them, the Corbassière glacier in Switzerland, has degraded so much that
it’s no longer viable for research, its ice cores a muddled mess of
meltwater.
</p>
<p>
“The climate archive is destroyed,” scientists at the Paul Scherrer
Institute wrote in a
<a href="https://www.psi.ch/en/media/our-research/glacier-melting-destroys-important-climate-data-archive" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>.
“It is as if someone had broken into a library and not only messed up
all the shelves and books, but also stole a lot of books and mixed up
the individual words in the remaining ones, making it impossible to
reconstruct the original texts.”
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Sustainable foods could have a $10 trillion upside
</h3>
<p>
Global food systems are “destroying more value than they create” and in
dire need of an overhaul, according to a new
<a href="https://foodsystemeconomics.org/wp-content/uploads/FSEC-Global_Policy_Report.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">assessment</a>
from the Food System Economics Commission (FSEC). By rethinking the way
we approach food, the authors say, we could create up to $10 trillion in
health and economic benefits around the world.
</p>
<p>
As Justine Calma
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/29/24054325/food-sustainable-agriculture-diet-benefits-report" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writes</a>
in <em>The Verge</em>, that would mean both a tweak to our diets — the
report doesn’t call for a worldwide shift to vegetarianism, but does
advocate for a reduction in meat consumption — and a proper accounting
in food prices of all the costs of production that we currently sweep
under the rug. That latter bit could be an especially tough pill to
swallow, and the study authors caution there would have to be
institutional support for lower-income sections of society for fear of
protests like the petrol price protests that
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/12/03/672862353/who-are-frances-yellow-vest-protesters-and-what-do-they-want" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gripped</a>
France in 2018, or the farmer protests
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/why-are-french-farmers-protesting-2024-01-29/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ongoing</a>
in Europe.
</p>
<p>
Still, the report states, the benefits would far outweigh the costs,
with undernutrition potentially eradicated by 2050, 174 million
premature deaths from diet-related chronic disease prevented, and the
environmental impacts bringing countries closer to their Paris Agreement
goals.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Avian flu comes for birds of all feathers
</h3>
<p>
Avian flu is devastating California’s “egg basket,” sweeping through
Sonoma and Merced counties a year after a similar outbreak in the
Midwest caused egg prices around the country to soar,
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/avian-flu-chicken-outbreak-california-poultry-eggs-976f0f82843bf716dbad64f459b4b8be" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to the Associated Press</a>. Over the past two months, commercial farms
have had to slaughter nearly a million birds to contain the outbreak.
The loss of those birds caused a temporary spike in the price of eggs in
the Bay Area before more were brought in from outside the region; it
remains to be seen if this outbreak will become big enough to affect
prices in other parts of the country as well.
</p>
<p>
Further afield, at least two penguins in the Antarctic have died from
bird flu,
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/29/first-penguins-die-in-antarctic-of-deadly-h5n1-bird-flu-strain-aoe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writes</a>
Phoebe Weston in <em>The Guardian</em>. One gentoo penguin is confirmed
to have died from the virus, and scientists suspect it also took out one
king penguin — if confirmed, that would be the first of its species to
be killed by the deadly H5N1 variant. Last year, scientists warned about
“one of the largest ecological disasters of modern times” if the virus
reached Antarctic penguin populations; the birds are currently clustered
for breeding season, which means it could soon turn into a superspreader
event.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>GoFundMe for climate disasters is helping the wealthy most
</h3>
<p>
A new
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4535190" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>
analyzing post-disaster crowdfunding campaigns has found that cash
raised through sites like GoFundMe disproportionately benefits the
wealthy. The main reason, Christopher Flavelle
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/29/climate/gofundme-disaster-relief-climate.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writes</a>
in <em>The New York Times</em>, appears to be social networks: Wealthy
people are more well-connected, particularly to other wealthy people,
and so inevitably get more money. It’s a showcase of why we need to
prioritize governmental support for disaster victims; as one of the
study authors told Flavelle, “we cannot count on this form of private
charity to fill funding gaps.”
</p>
<h2>
THE KICKER
</h2>
<p>
Scientists have, for the first time ever, captured footage of a newborn
Great White Shark. The finding means researchers could, finally, figure
out where the sharks birth their young — and in turn lead to greater
environmental protections in previously unprotected patches of ocean.

This is a blog post about a video, which is about new color-conversion
LUTs for Apple Log footage from the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max (updated
from my <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/applelog">first set</a>). The
video is also a mini-travelogue of my recent trips to Taiwan and Peru.
This post dives a bit deeper into both the LUT workflows, and my state
of mind about shooting digital-cinema-grade footage with a device I
always have with me.
</p>
<p>
There’s a lot going on here.

<p>
I always have a moment when packing for a trip: Which camera to bring?
Which lenses? I know I’m always happier when I pack less, like just a
single prime lens. But sometimes FOMO gets me and I pack three zooms.
</p>
<p>
For my trip to Lima, I brought my
<a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1645238-REG/sony_ilce7rm4a_b_alpha_a7r_iv_mirrorless.html/BI/4778/KBID/5292">Sony
a7RIV</a> with the uninspiring-but-compact,
<a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1008123-REG/sony_sel35f28z_sonnar_t_fe_35mm.html/BI/4778/KBID/5292">Sony
35mm F2.8 prime</a>. I lugged it around for a few days, but wasn’t
really feeling it.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, my iPhone 15 Pro Max was calling to me with its ProRes Log
video mode. “I’m 10-bit!” It would say. “Think of the fun you’ll have
color grading me!”
</p>
<p>
I told my phone to shut up, and proceeded to shoot very little with it —
or my Sony. Like a squirrel in the middle of the street, drawn in two
different directions at once, I creatively froze.
</p>
<p>
Photography, for me, is made up of a lot of habits, and shooting iPhone
video with aesthetic intent is just not yet baked into my travel muscle
memory.
</p>
<h2 id="made-in-taiwan">

<p>
A month later, I took a family trip to Taiwan, one of my favorite places
in the world. I’d had some time to process my Peru deadlock, and decided
to stop judging my own creative impulses, and let inspiration guide me
in which camera I pulled out.
</p>
<p>
I wound up shooting a lot of video.

I <em>loved</em> shooting ProRes Log in Taiwan with the iPhone 15 Pro
Max. I’d occasionally reach for
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blackmagic-camera/id6449580241">Blackmagic
Camera</a>, but I often just used the default camera app. I stuck my
phone (with its
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@prolost/post/C0VGQ8gPPyU">crumbling
case</a>) out of taxi sunroofs and skyscraper windows, held it above
teeming crowds and shoved it between chain-link fences. Seeing the broad
dynamic range I was capturing in scenarios from noontime sun to neon-lit
nights got me excited about grading the footage later.
</p>
<p>
It’s exactly the way I feel about shooting raw stills with my Sony,
knowing that I’ll be able to go crazy on them in Lightroom. The
photographing act is just half of the process.

<h2 id="luts-looks-and-magic-bullets">
LUTs, Looks, and Magic Bullets
</h2>
<p>
There’s been a bit of a gold rush of people hawking creative LUTs that
apply a particular “look” to iPhone Log footage. My day job is, in part,
helping make color tools like
<a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/red-giant/magic-bullet/looks">Magic
Bullet Looks</a>, which can do so much more than any LUT. Creative LUTs
are great, and by all means support the folks making them — but that’s
not what my iPhone LUTs
<a href="https://prolost.com/blog/applelog">were</a> or are.
</p>
<p>
The Prolost iPhone LUTs convert Apple Log to various other color spaces,
and support three kinds of workflow:
</p>
<h3 id="grade-under-a-display-transform-lut">
Grade Under a Display Transform LUT
</h3>
<p>
Apple Log is a totally decent color space to work in, so color
correcting Apple Log can be as simple as applying
<a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/red-giant/magic-bullet/colorista">Magic
Bullet Colorista</a> and choosing one of my <strong>Monitor &amp;
Grade</strong> LUTs. That’s what you see me doing in the video above.
Colorista (set to Log mode) does its work on the native Apple Log
pixels, and the LUT converts the result to look nice on video.
</p>
<p>
Many other systems work like this, including
<a href="https://luma-touch.com">LumaFusion</a>, which
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLtNJ8DbQrQ">ships with</a>
Prolost Apple Log LUTs.
</p>
<p>
The key is <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/applelog">color correcting
under the LUT</a>.
</p>
<h3 id="bring-apple-log-into-an-existing-workflow">
Bring Apple Log into an Existing Workflow
</h3>
<p>
Color work is often done in an intermediate color space. This is usually
some kind of wide-gamut, log format, such as Davinci Wide
Gamut/Intermediate, or one of the
<a href="https://prolost.com/blog/aces">ACES log spaces</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Prolost <strong>ACES</strong> LUTs convert Apple Log to either
ACEScc or ACEScct log, allowing you to grade your iPhone footage
alongside any other professional camera, and output them all through the
same pipeline.
</p>
<h3 id="shooting-through-a-lut">
Shooting Through a LUT
</h3>
<p>
The Blackmagic Camera app allows you to load any LUTs you want and
preview through them without baking them into your footage. With my
LUTs, you can shoot with the same LUTs you grade under later, for a
truly professional (no joke!) workflow.
</p>
<p>
The real stars of this update though are the <strong>FC</strong> LUTs.
They add an informative False Color overlay to the Shoot/Grade LUTs,
making sure you always nail your exposure. Watch the video to see them
in action. I already can’t imagine shooting without them.
</p>
<p>
These LUTs work well in Blackmagic Camera or even on an external HDMI
monitor.

<p>
As if this video wasn’t enough work already (I shot the a-roll in
mid-December), I decided to use it as a test case for creative editorial
in DaVinci Resolve. It’s the ACES LUTs that allowed me to incorporate
Magic Bullet Looks into my Resolve color workflow.
</p>
<p>
Maxon just shipped a really nice
<a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/article/maxon-red-giant-update-delivers-fast-beautiful-bokeh-and-realistic-lens-flares">update</a>
to Magic Bullet Looks, with simplified color management made possible by
more and more apps we support doing darn fine color management at the
timeline level.
</p>
<p>
So in Resolve, I can use my LUT to convert Apple Log to ACEScc, and then
apply Magic Bullet Looks, which can now be set to work in ACEScc with a
single click.

I can sneak additional Resolve corrector nodes in between those two for

creative look development, so this is a match made in heaven.

Gear Inspires
</h2>
<p>
Every photographer knows the feeling of lusting after new gear. We know
it so well that we remind ourselves constantly that “next camera
syndrome” is debilitating, and that “most cameras are better than most
photographers.” Gear is not the answer. Go shoot.
</p>
<p>
There is, however, a counterpoint to these truths: As shooters, we take
inspiration where we can get it. And sometimes a new technique, a new
locale, or even, yes, a new bit of gear is what provides it.
</p>
<p>
The key is to listen for that inspiration, and don’t judge it.
</p>
<p>
Even if it’s coming from your phone.

<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: Dan Rather’s Steady</p>
<p>There’s an old expression in boxing, a “slugger’s chance.” It means
an underdog is given an outside chance to win if the fighter has a
reputation for being an especially heavy puncher. I’ve been saying since
Nikki Haley first got into the race for the Republican presidential
nomination that she had a slugger’s chance. With Haley’s bid for an
upset fading but not yet finished, let’s take a look at whether she
still has even that chance. The so-called smart money has said from the
start that there is no way she can defeat Donald Trump.</p>

My McLuhan lecture on enshittification (30 Jan 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links My McLuhan lecture on enshittification: Live from
Berlin. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history:
2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent
appearances, current writing projects, current reading My McLuhan
lecture on enshittification (permalink) Last night, I gave the annual
Marshall McLuhan lecture at the Transmediale festival in Berlin. The
event was sold out and while there’s a video that’ll be posted soon,
they couldn’t get a streaming setup installed in the Canadian embassy,
where the talk was held:
https://transmediale.de/en/2024/event/mcluhan-2024 The talk went of
fabulously, and was followed by commentary from Frederike Kaltheuner
(Human Rights Watch) and a discussion moderated by Helen Starr. While
you’ll have to wait a bit for the video, I thought that I’d post my talk
notes from last night for the impatient among you. I want to thank the
festival and the embassy staff for their hard work on an excellent
event, and reiterate what a pleasure it was to meet John Horgan,
Canada’s ambassador to Germany. And now, on to the talk! Last year, I
coined the term ‘enshittification,’ to describe the way that platforms
decay. That obscene little word did big numbers, it really hit the
zeitgeist. I mean, the American Dialect Society made it their Word of
the Year for 2023 (which, I suppose, means that now I’m definitely
getting a poop emoji on my tombstone). So what’s enshittification and
why did it catch fire? It’s my theory explaining how the internet was
colonized by platforms, and why all those platforms are degrading so
quickly and thoroughly, and why it matters – and what we can do about
it. We’re all living through the enshittocene, a great enshittening, in
which the services that matter to us, that we rely on, are turning into
giant piles of shit. It’s frustrating. It’s demoralizing. It’s even
terrifying. I think that the enshittification framework goes a long way
to explaining it, moving us out of the mysterious realm of the ‘great
forces of history,’ and into the material world of specific decisions
made by named people – decisions we can reverse and people whose
addresses and pitchfork sizes we can learn. Enshittification names the
problem and proposes a solution. It’s not just a way to say ‘things are
getting worse’ (though of course, it’s fine with me if you want to use
it that way. It’s an English word. We don’t have der Rat für Englisch
Rechtschreibung. English is a free for all. Go nuts, meine Kerle). But
in case you want to use enshittification in a more precise, technical
way, let’s examine how enshittification works. It’s a three stage
process: First, platforms are good to their users; then they abuse their
users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they
abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for
themselves. Then, they die. Let’s do a case study. What could be better
than Facebook? Facebook is a company that was founded to nonconsensually
rate the fuckability of Harvard undergrads, and it only got worse after
that. When Facebook started off, it was only open to US college and
high-school kids with .edu and k-12.us addresses. But in 2006, it opened
up to the general public. It told them: “Yes, I know you’re all using
Myspace. But Myspace is owned by Rupert Murdoch, an evil, crapulent
senescent Australian billionaire, who spies on you with every hour that
God sends. “Sign up with Facebook and we will never spy on you. Come and
tell us who matters to you in this world, and we will compose a personal
feed consisting solely of what those people post for consumption by
those who choose to follow them.” That was stage one. Facebook had a
surplus — its investors’ cash — and it allocated that surplus to its
end-users. Those end-users proceeded to lock themselves into FB.
FB — like most tech businesses — has network effects on its side. A
product or service enjoys network effects when it improves as more
people sign up to use it. You joined FB because your friends were there,
and then others signed up because you were there. But FB didn’t just
have high network effects, it had high switching costs. Switching costs
are everything you have to give up when you leave a product or service.
In Facebook’s case, it was all the friends there that you followed and
who followed you. In theory, you could have all just left for somewhere
else; in practice, you were hamstrung by the collective action problem.
It’s hard to get lots of people to do the same thing at the same time.
You and your six friends here are going to struggle to agree on where to
get drinks after tonight’s lecture. How were you and your 200 Facebook
friends ever gonna agree on when it was time to leave Facebook, and
where to go? So FB’s end-users engaged in a mutual hostage-taking that
kept them glued to the platform. Then FB exploited that hostage
situation, withdrawing the surplus from end-users and allocating it to
two groups of business customers: advertisers, and publishers. To the
advertisers, FB said, ‘Remember when we told those rubes we wouldn’t spy
on them? We lied. We spy on them from asshole to appetite. We will sell
you access to that surveillance data in the form of fine-grained
ad-targeting, and we will devote substantial engineering resources to
thwarting ad-fraud. Your ads are dirt cheap to serve, and we’ll spare no
expense to make sure that when you pay for an ad, a real human sees it.’
To the publishers, FB said, ‘Remember when we told those rubes we would
only show them the things they asked to see? We lied!Upload short
excerpts from your website, append a link, and we will nonconsensually
cram it into the eyeballs of users who never asked to see it. We are
offering you a free traffic funnel that will drive millions of users to
your website to monetize as you please, and those users will become
stuck to you when they subscribe to your feed.’ And so advertisers and
publishers became stuck to the platform, too, dependent on those users.
The users held each other hostage, and those hostages took the
publishers and advertisers hostage, too, so that everyone was locked in.
Which meant it was time for the third stage of enshittification:
withdrawing surplus from everyone and handing it to Facebook’s
shareholders. For the users, that meant dialing down the share of
content from accounts you followed to a homeopathic dose, and filling
the resulting void with ads and pay-to-boost content from publishers.
For advertisers, that meant jacking up prices and drawing down
anti-fraud enforcement, so advertisers paid much more for ads that were
far less likely to be seen by a person. For publishers, this meant
algorithmically suppressing the reach of their posts unless they
included an ever-larger share of their articles in the excerpt, until
anything less than fulltext was likely to be be disqualified from being
sent to your subscribers, let alone included in algorithmic suggestion
feeds. And then FB started to punish publishers for including a link
back to their own sites, so they were corralled into posting fulltext
feeds with no links, meaning they became commodity suppliers to
Facebook, entirely dependent on the company both for reach and for
monetization, via the increasingly crooked advertising service. When any
of these groups squawked, FB just repeated the lesson that every tech
executive learned in the Darth Vader MBA: ‘I have altered the deal. Pray
I don’t alter it any further.’ Facebook now enters the most dangerous
phase of enshittification. It wants to withdraw all available surplus,
and leave just enough residual value in the service to keep end users
stuck to each other, and business customers stuck to end users, without
leaving anything extra on the table, so that every extractable penny is
drawn out and returned to its shareholders. But that’s a very brittle
equilibrium, because the difference between “I hate this service but I
can’t bring myself to quit it,” and “Jesus Christ, why did I wait so
long to quit? Get me the hell out of here!” is razor thin All it takes
is one Cambridge Analytica scandal, one whistleblower, one livestreamed
mass-shooting, and users bolt for the exits, and then FB discovers that
network effects are a double-edged sword. If users can’t leave because
everyone else is staying, when when everyone starts to leave, there’s no
reason not to go, too. That’s terminal enshittification, the phase when
a platform becomes a pile of shit. This phase is usually accompanied by
panic, which tech bros euphemistically call ‘pivoting.’ Which is how we
get pivots like, ‘In the future, all internet users will be transformed
into legless, sexless, low-polygon, heavily surveilled cartoon
characters in a virtual world called “metaverse,” that we ripped off
from a 25-year-old satirical cyberpunk novel.’ That’s the procession of
enshittification. If enshittification were a disease, we’d call that
enshittification’s “natural history.” But that doesn’t tell you how the
enshittification works, nor why everything is enshittifying right now,
and without those details, we can’t know what to do about it. What led
to the enshittocene? What is it about this moment that led to the Great
Enshittening? Was it the end of the Zero Interest Rate Policy? Was it a
change in leadership at the tech giants? Is Mercury in retrograde? None
of the above. The period of free fed money certainly led to tech
companies having a lot of surplus to toss around. But Facebook started
enshittifying long before ZIRP ended, so did Amazon, Microsoft and
Google. Some of the tech giants got new leaders. But Google’s
enshittification got worse when the founders came back to oversee the
company’s AI panic (excuse me, ‘AI pivot’). And it can’t be Mercury in
retrograde, because I’m a cancer, and as everyone knows, cancers don’t
believe in astrology. When a whole bunch of independent entities all
change in the same way at once, that’s a sign that the environment has
changed, and that’s what happened to tech. Tech companies, like all
companies, have conflicting imperatives. On the one hand, they want to
make money. On the other hand, making money involves hiring and
motivating competent staff, and making products that customers want to
buy. The more value a company permits its employees and customers to
carve off, the less value it can give to its shareholders. The
equilibrium in which companies produce things we like in honorable ways
at a fair price is one in which charging more, worsening quality, and
harming workers costs more than the company would make by playing dirty.
There are four forces that discipline companies, serving as constraints
on their enshittificatory impulses. First: competition. Companies that
fear you will take your business elsewhere are cautious about worsening
quality or raising prices. Second: regulation. Companies that fear a
regulator will fine them more than they expect to make from cheating,
will cheat less. These two forces affect all industries, but the next
two are far more tech-specific. Third: self-help. Computers are
extremely flexible, and so are the digital products and services we make
from them. The only computer we know how to make is the Turing-complete
Von Neumann machine, a computer that can run every valid program. That
means that users can always avail themselves of programs that undo the
anti-features that shift value from them to a company’s shareholders.
Think of a board-room table where someone says, ‘I’ve calculated that
making our ads 20% more invasive will net us 2% more revenue per user.’
In a digital world, someone else might well say ‘Yes, but if we do that,
20% of our users will install ad-blockers, and our revenue from those
users will drop to zero, forever.’ This means that digital companies are
constrained by the fear that some enshittificatory maneuver will prompt
their users to google, ‘How do I disenshittify this?’ Fourth and
finally: workers. Tech workers have very low union density, but that
doesn’t mean that tech workers don’t have labor power. The historical
“talent shortage” of the tech sector meant that workers enjoyed a lot of
leverage over their bosses. Workers who disagreed with their bosses
could quit and walk across the street and get another job – a better
job. They knew it, and their bosses knew it. Ironically, this made tech
workers highly exploitable. Tech workers overwhelmingly saw themselves
as founders in waiting, entrepreneurs who were temporarily drawing a
salary, heroic figures of the tech mission. That’s why mottoes like
Google’s ‘don’t be evil’ and Facebook’s ‘make the world more open and
connected’ mattered: they instilled a sense of mission in workers. It’s
what Fobazi Ettarh calls ‘vocational awe, ’or Elon Musk calls being
’extremely hardcore.’ Tech workers had lots of bargaining power, but
they didn’t flex it when their bosses demanded that they sacrifice their
health, their families, their sleep to meet arbitrary deadlines. So long
as their bosses transformed their workplaces into whimsical ‘campuses,’
with gyms, gourmet cafeterias, laundry service, massages and
egg-freezing, workers could tell themselves that they were being
pampered – rather than being made to work like government mules. But for
bosses, there’s a downside to motivating your workers with appeals to a
sense of mission, namely: your workers will feel a sense of mission. So
when you ask them to enshittify the products they ruined their health to
ship, workers will experience a sense of profound moral injury, respond
with outrage, and threaten to quit. Thus tech workers themselves were
the final bulwark against enshittification, The pre-enshittification era
wasn’t a time of better leadership. The executives weren’t better. They
were constrained. Their worst impulses were checked by competition,
regulation, self-help and worker power. So what happened? One by one,
each of these constraints was eroded until it dissolved, leaving the
enshittificatory impulse unchecked, ushering in the enshittoscene. It
started with competition. From the Gilded Age until the Reagan years,
the purpose of competition law was to promote competition. US antitrust
law treated corporate power as dangerous and sought to blunt it.
European antitrust laws were modeled on US ones, imported by the
architects of the Marshall Plan. But starting in the neoliberal era,
competition authorities all over the world adopted a doctrine called
‘consumer welfare,’ which held that monopolies were evidence of quality.
If everyone was shopping at the same store and buying the same product,
that meant it was the best store, selling the best product – not that
anyone was cheating. And so all over the world, governments stopped
enforcing their competition laws. They just ignored them as companies
flouted them. Those companies merged with their major competitors,
absorbed small companies before they could grow to be big threats. They
held an orgy of consolidation that produced the most inbred industries
imaginable, whole sectors grown so incestuous they developed Habsburg
jaws, from eyeglasses to sea freight, glass bottles to payment
processing, vitamin C to beer. Most of our global economy is dominated
by five or fewer global companies. If smaller companies refuse to sell
themselves to these cartels, the giants have free rein to flout
competition law further, with ‘predatory pricing’ that keeps an
independent rival from gaining a foothold. When Diapers.com refused
Amazon’s acquisition offer, Amazon lit $100m on fire, selling diapers
way below cost for months, until diapers.com went bust, and Amazon
bought them for pennies on the dollar, and shut them down. Competition
is a distant memory. As Tom Eastman says, the web has devolved into
‘five giant websites filled with screenshots of text from the other
four,’ so these giant companies no longer fear losing our business. Lily
Tomlin used to do a character on the TV show Laugh In, an AT&amp;T
telephone operator who’d do commercials for the Bell system. Each one
would end with her saying ‘We don’t care. We don’t have to. We’re the
phone company.’ Today’s giants are not constrained by competition. They
don’t care. They don’t have to. They’re Google. That’s the first
constraint gone, and as it slipped away, the second constraint –
regulation – was also doomed. When an industry consists of hundreds of
small- and medium-sized enterprises, it is a mob, a rabble. Hundreds of
companies can’t agree on what to tell Parliament or Congress or the
Commission. They can’t even agree on how to cater a meeting where they’d
discuss the matter. But when a sector dwindles to a bare handful of
dominant firms, it ceases to be a rabble and it becomes a cartel. Five
companies, or four, or three, or two, or just one company finds it easy
to converge on a single message for their regulators, and without
“wasteful competition” eroding their profits, they have plenty of cash
to spread around. Like Facebook, handing former UK deputy PM Nick Clegg
millions every year to sleaze around Europe, telling his former
colleagues that Facebook is the only thing standing between ‘European
Cyberspace’ and the Chinese Communist Party. Tech’s regulatory capture
allows it to flout the rules that constrain less concentrated sectors.
They can pretend that violating labor, consumer and privacy laws is
fine, because they violate them with an app. This is why competition
matters: it’s not just because competition makes companies work harder
and share value with customers and workers, it’s because competition
keeps companies from becoming too big to fail, and too big to jail. Now,
there’s plenty of things we don’t want improved through competition,
like privacy invasions. After the EU passed its landmark privacy law,
the GDPR, there was a mass-extinction event for small EU ad-tech
companies. These companies disappeared en masse, and that’s fine. They
were even more invasive and reckless than US-based Big Tech companies.
After all, they had less to lose. We don’t want competition in
commercial surveillance. We don’t want to produce increasing efficiency
in violating our human rights. But: Google and Facebook – who pretend
they are called Alphabet and Meta – have been unscathed by European
privacy law. That’s not because they don’t violate the GDPR (they do!).
It’s because they pretend they are headquartered in Ireland, one of the
EU’s most notorious corporate crime-havens. And Ireland competes with
the EU other crime havens – Malta, Luxembourg, Cyprus and sometimes the
Netherlands – to see which country can offer the most hospitable
environment for all sorts of crimes. Because the kind of company that
can fly an Irish flag of convenience is mobile enough to change to a
Maltese flag if the Irish start enforcing EU laws. Which is how you get
an Irish Data Protection Commission that processes fewer than 20 major
cases per year, while Germany’s data commissioner handles more than 500
major cases, even though Ireland is nominal home to the most
privacy-invasive companies on the continent. So Google and Facebook get
to act as though they are immune to privacy law, because they violate
the law with an app; just like Uber can violate labor law and claim it
doesn’t count because they do it with an app. Uber’s labor-pricing
algorithm offers different drivers different payments for the same job,
something Veena Dubal calls ‘algorithmic wage discrimination.’ If you’re
more selective about which jobs you’ll take, Uber will pay you more for
every ride. But if you take those higher payouts and ditch whatever
side-hustle let you cover your bills which being picky about your Uber
drives, Uber will incrementally reduce the payment, toggling up and down
as you grow more or less selective, playing you like a fish on a line
until you eventually – inevitably – lose to the tireless pricing robot,
and end up stuck with low wages and all your side-hustles gone. Then
there’s Amazon, which violates consumer protection laws, but says it
doesn’t matter, because they do it with an app. Amazon makes $38b/year
from its ‘advertising’ system. ‘Advertising’ in quotes because they’re
not selling ads, they’re selling placements in search results. The
companies that spend the most on ‘ads’ go to the top, even if they’re
offering worse products at higher prices. If you click the first link in
an Amazon search result, on average you will pay a 29% premium over the
best price on the service. Click one of the first four items and you’ll
pay a 25% premium. On average you have to go seventeen items down to
find the best deal on Amazon. Any merchant that did this to you in a
physical storefront would be fined into oblivion. But Amazon has
captured its regulators, so it can violate your rights, and say, “it
doesn’t count, we did it with an app” This is where that third
constraint, self-help, would sure come in handy. If you don’t want your
privacy violated, you don’t need to wait for the Irish privacy regulator
to act, you can just install an ad-blocker. More than half of all web
users are blocking ads. But the web is an open platform, developed in
the age when tech was hundreds of companies at each others’ throats,
unable to capture their regulators. Today, the web is being devoured by
apps, and apps are ripe for enshittification. Regulatory capture isn’t
just the ability to flout regulation, it’s also the ability to co-opt
regulation, to wield regulation against your adversaries. Today’s tech
giants got big by exploiting self-help measures. When Facebook was
telling Myspace users they needed to escape Rupert Murdoch’s evil
crapulent Australian social media panopticon, it didn’t just say to
those Myspacers, ‘Screw your friends, come to Facebook and just hang out
looking at the cool privacy policy until they get here’ It gave them a
bot. You fed the bot your Myspace username and password, and it would
login to Myspace and pretend to be you, and scrape everything waiting in
your inbox, copying it to your FB inbox, and you could reply to it and
it would autopilot your replies back to Myspace. When Microsoft was
choking off Apple’s market oxygen by refusing to ship a functional
version of Microsoft Office for the Mac – so that offices were throwing
away their designers’ Macs and giving them PCs with upgraded graphics
cards and Windows versions of Photoshop and Illustrator – Steve Jobs
didn’t beg Bill Gates to update Mac Office. He got his technologists to
reverse-engineer Microsoft Office, and make a compatible suite, the
iWork Suite, whose apps, Pages, Numbers and Keynote could perfectly read
and write Microsoft’s Word, Excel and Powerpoint files. When Google
entered the market, it sent its crawler to every web server on Earth,
where it presented itself as a web-user: ‘Hi! Hello! Do you have any web
pages? Thanks! How about some more? How about more?’ But every pirate
wants to be an admiral. When Facebook, Apple and Google were doing this
adversarial interoperability, that was progress. If you try to do it to
them, that’s piracy. Try to make an alternative client for Facebook and
they’ll say you violated US laws like the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act and EU laws like Article 6 of the EUCD. Try to make an Android
program that can run iPhone apps and play back the data from Apple’s
media stores and they’d bomb you until the rubble bounced. Try to scrape
all of Google and they’ll nuke you until you glowed. Tech’s regulatory
capture is mind-boggling. Take that law I mentioned earlier, Section
1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or DMCA. Bill Clinton
signed it in 1998, and the EU imported it as Article 6 of the EUCD in
2001 It is a blanket prohibition on removing any kind of encryption that
restricts access to a copyrighted work – things like ripping DVDs or
jailbreaking a phone – with penalties of a five-year prison sentence and
a $500k fine for a first offense. This law has been so broadened that it
can be used to imprison creators for granting access to their own
creations Here’s how that works: In 2008, Amazon bought Audible, an
audiobook platform, in an anticompetitive acquisition. Today, Audible is
a monopolist with more than 90% of the audiobook market. Audible
requires that all creators on their platform sell with Amazon’s “digital
rights management,” which locks it to Amazon’s apps. So say I write a
book, then I read it into a mic, then I pay a director and an engineer
thousands of dollars to turn that into an audiobook, and sell it to you
on the monopoly platform, Audible, that controls more than 90% of the
market. If I later decide to leave Amazon and want to let you come with
me to a rival platform, I am out of luck. If I supply you with a tool to
remove Amazon’s encryption from my audiobook, so you can play it in
another app, I commit a felony, punishable by a 5-year sentence and a
half-million-dollar fine, for a first offense. That’s a stiffer penalty
than you would face if you simply pirated the audiobook from a torrent
site. But it’s also harsher than the punishment you’d get for
shoplifting the audiobook on CD from a truck-stop. It’s harsher than the
sentence you’d get for hijacking the truck that delivered the CD. So
think of our ad-blockers again. 50% of web users are running
ad-blockers. 0% of app users are running ad-blockers, because adding a
blocker to an app requires that you first remove its encryption, and
that’s a felony (Jay Freeman calls this ‘felony contempt of
business-model’). So when someone in a board-room says, ‘let’s make our
ads 20% more obnoxious and get a 2% revenue increase,’ no one objects
that this might prompt users to google, ‘how do I block ads?’ After all,
the answer is, ‘you can’t.’ Indeed, it’s more likely that someone in
that board room will say, ‘let’s make our ads 100% more obnoxious and
get a 10% revenue increase’ (this is why every company wants you to
install an app instead of using its website). There’s no reason that gig
workers who are facing algorithmic wage discrimination couldn’t install
a counter-app that coordinated among all the Uber drivers to reject all
jobs unless they reach a certain pay threshold. No reason except felony
contempt of business model, the threat that the toolsmiths who built
that counter-app would go broke or land in prison, for violating DMCA
1201, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, trademark, copyright, patent,
contract, trade secrecy, nondisclosure and noncompete, or in other
words: ‘IP law.’ ‘IP’ is just a euphemism for ‘a law that lets me reach
beyond the walls of my company and control the conduct of my critics,
competitors and customers.’ And ‘app’ is just a euphemism for ‘a
web-page wrapped enough IP to make it a felony to mod it to protect the
labor, consumer and privacy rights of its user.’ We don’t care. We don’t
have to. We’re the phone company. But what about that fourth constraint:
workers? For decades, tech workers’ high degrees of bargaining power and
vocational awe put a ceiling on enshittification. Even after the tech
sector shrank to a handful of giants. Even after they captured their
regulators so they could violate our consumer, privacy and labor rights.
Even after they created ‘felony contempt of business model’ and
extinguished self-help for tech users. Tech was still constrained by
their workers’ sense of moral injury in the face of the imperative to
enshittify. Remember when tech workers dreamed of working for a big
company for a few years, before striking out on their own to start their
own company that would knock that tech giant over? Then that dream
shrank to: work for a giant for a few years, quit, do a fake startup,
get acqui-hired by your old employer, as a complicated way of getting a
bonus and a promotion. Then the dream shrank further: work for a tech
giant for your whole life, get free kombucha and massages on Wednesdays.
And now, the dream is over. All that’s left is: work for a tech giant
until they fire your ass, like those 12,000 Googlers who got fired last
year six months after a stock buyback that would have paid their
salaries for the next 27 years. Workers are no longer a check on their
bosses’ worst impulses Today, the response to ‘I refuse to make this
product worse’ is, ‘turn in your badge and don’t let the door hit you in
the ass on the way out.’ I get that this is all a little depressing OK,
really depressing. But hear me out! We’ve identified the disease. We’ve
traced its natural history. We’ve identified its underlying mechanism.
Now we can get to work on a cure. There are four constraints that
prevent enshittification: competition, regulation, self-help and labor.
To reverse enshittification and guard against its reemergence, we must
restore and strengthen each of these. On competition, it’s actually
looking pretty good. The EU, the UK, the US, Canada, Australia, Japan
and China are all doing more on competition than they have in two
generations. They’re blocking mergers, unwinding existing ones, taking
action on predatory pricing and other sleazy tactics. Remember, in the
US and Europe, we already have the laws to do this – we just stopped
enforcing them in the Helmut Kohl era. I’ve been fighting these fights
with the Electronic Frontier Foundation for 22 years now, and I’ve never
seen a more hopeful moment for sound, informed tech policy. Now, the
enshittifiers aren’t taking this laying down. The business press can’t
stop talking about how stupid and old-fashioned all this stuff is. They
call people like me ‘hipster antitrust,’ and they hate any regulator who
actually does their job. Take Lina Khan, the brilliant head of the US
Federal Trade Commission, who has done more in three years on antitrust
than the combined efforts of all her predecessors over the past 40
years. Rupert Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal has run more than 80
editorials trashing Khan, insisting that she’s an ineffectual ideologue
who can’t get anything done. Sure, Rupert, that’s why you ran 80
editorials about her. Because she can’t get anything done. Even Canada
is stepping up on competition. Canada! Land of the evil billionaire!
From Ted Rogers, who owns the country’s telecoms; to Galen Weston, who
owns the country’s grocery stores; to the Irvings, who basically own the
entire province of New Brunswick. Even Canada is doing something about
this. Last autumn, Trudeau’s government promised to update Canada’s
creaking competition law to finally ban ‘abuse of dominance.’ I mean,
wow. I guess when Galen Weston decided to engage in a criminal
conspiracy to fix the price of bread – the most Les Miz-ass crime
imaginable – it finally got someone’s attention, eh? Competition has a
long way to go, but all over the world, competition law is seeing a
massive revitalization. Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher put
antitrust law in a coma in the 80s – but it’s awake, it’s back, and it’s
pissed. What about regulation? How will we get tech companies to stop
doing that one weird trick of adding ‘with an app’ to their crimes and
escaping enforcement? Well, here in the EU, they’re starting to figure
it out. This year, the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act
went into effect, and they let people who get screwed by tech companies
go straight to the federal European courts, bypassing the toothless
watchdogs in Europe’s notorious corporate crime havens like Ireland. In
America, they might finally get a digital privacy law. You people have
no idea how backwards US privacy law is. The last time the US Congress
enacted a broadly applicable privacy law was in 1988. The Video Privacy
Protection Act makes it a crime for video-store clerks to leak your
video-rental history. It was passed after a right-wing judge who was up
for the Supreme Court had his rentals published in a DC newspaper. The
rentals weren’t even all that embarrassing! Sure, that judge, Robert
Bork, wasn’t confirmed for the Supreme Court, but that was because he
was a virulently racist loudmouth and a crook who served as Nixon’s
Solicitor General. But Congress got the idea that their video records
might be next, freaked out, and passed the VPPA. That was the last time
Americans got a big, national privacy law. Nineteen. Eighty. Eight. It’s
been a minute. And the thing is, there’s a lot of people who are angry
about stuff that has some nexus with America’s piss-poor privacy
landscape. Worried that Facebook turned Grampy into a Qanon? That Insta
made your teen anorexic? That TikTok is brainwashing millennials into
quoting Osama Bin Laden? Or that cops are rolling up the identities of
everyone at a Black Lives Matter protest or the Jan 6 riots by getting
location data from Google? Or that Red State Attorneys General are
tracking teen girls to out-of-state abortion clinics? Or that Black
people are being discriminated against by online lending or hiring
platforms? Or that someone is making AI deepfake porn of you? Having a
federal privacy law with a private right of action – which means that
individuals can sue companies that violate their privacy – would go a
long way to rectifying all of these problems. There’s a big coalition
for that kind of privacy law. What about self-help? That’s a lot farther
away, alas. The EU’s DMA will force tech companies to open up their
walled gardens for interoperation. You’ll be able to use Whatsapp to
message people on iMessage, or quit Facebook and move to Mastodon, but
still send messages to the people left behind. But if you want to
reverse-engineer one of those Big Tech products and mod it to work for
you, not them, the EU’s got nothing for you. This is an area ripe for
improvement, and I think the US might be the first ones to open this up.
It’s certainly on-brand for the EU to be forcing tech companies to do
things a certain way, while the US simply takes away tech companies’
abilities to prevent others from changing how their stuff works. My big
hope here is that Stein’s Law will take hold: ‘Anything that can’t go on
forever will eventually stop’ Letting companies decide how their
customers must use their products is simply too tempting an invitation
to mischief. HP has a whole building full of engineers thinking of new
ways to lock your printer to its official ink cartridges, forcing you to
spend $10,000/gallon on ink to print your boarding passes and shopping
lists. It’s offensive. The only people who don’t agree are the people
running the monopolies in all the other industries, like the med-tech
monopolists who are locking their insulin pumps to their glucose
monitors, turning people with diabetes into walking inkjet printers.
Finally, there’s labor. Here in Europe, there’s much higher union
density than in the US, which American tech barons are learning the hard
way. There is nothing more satisfying in the daily news than the latest
salvo by Nordic unions against that Tesla guy (Musk is the most
Edison-ass Tesla guy imaginable). But even in the USA, there’s a massive
surge in tech unions. Tech workers are realizing that they aren’t
founders in waiting. The days of free massages and facial piercings and
getting to wear black tee shirts that say things your boss doesn’t
understand are coming to an end. In Seattle, Amazon’s tech workers
walked out in sympathy with Amazon’s warehouse workers, because they’re
all workers. The only reason the tech workers aren’t monitored by AI
that notifies their managers if they visit the toilet during working
hours is their rapidly dwindling bargaining power. The way things are
going, Amazon programmers are going to be pissing in bottles next to
their workstations (for a guy who built a penis-shaped rocket, Jeff
Bezos really hates our kidneys). We’re seeing bold, muscular, global
action on competition, regulation and labor, with self-help bringing up
the rear. It’s not a moment too soon, because the bad news is,
enshittification is coming to every industry. If it’s got a networked
computer in it, the people who made it can run the Darth Vader MBA
playbook on it, changing the rules from moment to moment, violating your
rights and then saying ‘It’s OK, we did it with an app.’ From Mercedes
renting you your accelerator pedal by the month to Internet of Things
dishwashers that lock you into proprietary dishsoap, enshittification is
metastasizing into every corner of our lives. Software doesn’t eat the
world, it enshittifies it But there’s a bright side to all this: if
everyone is threatened by enshittification, then everyone has a stake in
disenshittification. Just as with privacy law in the US, the potential
anti-enshittification coalition is massive, it’s unstoppable. The cynics
among you might be skeptical that this will make a difference. After
all, isn’t “enshittification” the same as “capitalism”? Well, no. Look,
I’m not going to cape for capitalism here. I’m hardly a true believer in
markets as the most efficient allocators of resources and arbiters of
policy – if there was ever any doubt, capitalism’s total failure to
grapple with the climate emergency surely erases it. But the capitalism
of 20 years ago made space for a wild and wooly internet, a space where
people with disfavored views could find each other, offer mutual aid,
and organize. The capitalism of today has produced a global, digital
ghost mall, filled with botshit, crapgadgets from companies with
consonant-heavy brand-names, and cryptocurrency scams. The internet
isn’t more important than the climate emergency, nor gender justice,
racial justice, genocide, or inequality. But the internet is the terrain
we’ll fight those fights on. Without a free, fair and open internet, the
fight is lost before it’s joined. We can reverse the enshittification of
the internet. We can halt the creeping enshittification of every digital
device. We can build a better, enshittification-resistant digital
nervous system, one that is fit to coordinate the mass movements we will
need to fight fascism, end genocide, and save our planet and our
species. Martin Luther King said ‘It may be true that the law cannot
make a man love me, but it can stop him from lynching me, and I think
that’s pretty important.’ And it may be true that the law can’t force
corporate sociopaths to conceive of you as a human being entitled to
dignity and fair treatment, and not just an ambulatory wallet, a supply
of gut-bacteria for the immortal colony organism that is a limited
liability corporation. But it can make that exec fear you enough to
treat you fairly and afford you dignity, even if he doesn’t think you
deserve it. And I think that’s pretty important. (Image: Drahtlos, CC

Fact Checked Everything Trump Has Said About Climate Change Since

<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDk5NDcyOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NjU2MjgwOX0.nKge2TolZ-ZiwtFmruyWLFp4oTsr28YBwZcyCYsNrpQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
“Climate change is a hoax” is <em>soooo </em>2016. In recent years,
Republicans have
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/2024-election-climate-trump" target="_self">gotten
more savvy</a> in their attacks on climate change — and, by proxy, on
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/the-inflation-reduction-act-remains-astonishing" target="_self">the
Inflation Reduction Act</a>, the landmark climate legislation passed in
2022. These days, it’s less the science of global warming that’s up for
debate than the way we’re addressing it. Republicans are now fighting a
multi-front battle against EVs, the energy transition, and climate
science, on behalf of golden eagles and whales. And no one is leading
the charge more obviously than former president and current presidential
candidate Donald Trump, whose decisive primary victories in
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-iowa-caucus-victory-speech-evs-ethanol-drilling" target="_self">Iowa</a>
and New Hampshire this month have made him the likely Republican
nominee.
</p>
<p>
With Trump leading in the
<a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/elections/president/2024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">general
election polls</a> and
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/27/project-2025-dismantle-us-climate-policy-next-republican-president" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
climate agenda on the line</a>, Heatmap is keeping a running list of his
climate-related statements on the campaign trail. We’ve looked at his
rallies, his TV appearances, and his comments on social media and put
together a list of Trump’s most frequent and glaringly inaccurate claims
since he vacated the White House in January 2021.
</p>
<p>
If you’re looking just for the new stuff — on whether liquified natural
gas is “good for the environment,” among other things (spoiler alert:
it’s not) — you can find that <a href="#lng">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
While some of his musings (okay, fine, a lot of them) might be laughably
absurd, others might be something you’ve kind of, sort of wondered
about, yourself. To help you better separate fact from fiction, we’ve
added context and explanation to each quote, along with a bottom-line
determination as to the remark’s facticity.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, this list is a work in progress and will be regularly updated
and added to in the coming months, so if you’re ever in doubt, know that
you can find the answer somewhere in here. For ease of navigation, we’ve
broken things down into sections:

well-being — as well as
<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/stephen-colbert-trump-climate-gaffe-b2483334.html" target="_blank">a
late-night bit by Stephen Colbert</a>. While <strong>it’s unclear
exactly what Trump was going on about</strong>, we <em>can</em> get a
few things straight:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
“Clime” is usually used as a geographic term to refer to a
<em>particular</em> region’s climate. As in, “<em>We left New York for
the warmer climes of Florida.” </em>The Oxford Learner’s Dictionary says
its use is usually “literary or humorous.”
</li>
<br/>
<li>
“Climate” refers to weather patterns in a given area, taken as a whole.
“When scientists talk about climate, they’re often looking at averages
of precipitation, temperature, humidity, sunshine, wind, and other
measures of weather that occur over a long period in a particular
place,”
<a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/weather-vs-climate" target="_blank">NOAA
explains</a>. (A 30-year window is pretty typical when speaking about a
place’s climate.)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And just for good measure, “weather” differs from “climate” or “clime”
in that it refers to short-term meteorological events in a specific
place. So while the <em>weather</em> on a given day, week, or month can
be unseasonably cold, the overall <em>climate</em> can still be warming.
</p>
<blockquote>
<em>“You know they don’t call it global warming so much now, they call
it climate change because it wasn’t working … Global warming wasn’t
working when it was cooling. So now they call it climate change, that
takes care of everything.”</em>
[<a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1732231225895432458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1732231225895432458%7Ctwgr%5E382b4d715f43b24d62c3fe54ba69a436836e41a6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-35245541441656720993.ampproject.net%2F2312012346000%2Fframe.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dec. 5,

</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Fact check: </strong>The term “climate change” was initially
popularized by Republicans. In a
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/02/us/a-call-for-softer-greener-language.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2002
memo</a>, Republican pollster Frank Luntz urged President George W. Bush
to drop the phrase “global warming” in favor of “climate change” since
the former sounds more “frightening” and “has catastrophic
communications attached to it,” while “climate change sounds a more
controllable and less emotional challenge.”
</p>
<p>
That said, <strong>scientists generally prefer the term “climate
change”</strong> for pretty much exactly the reason Trump highlighted
here — because it encompasses phenomena caused by the increase in CO2 in
our atmosphere that don’t manifest as warming, like ocean acidification.
For the record: Global warming doesn’t mean that the weather will
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/east-west-flood-blizzard-storm" target="_self">never
get cold</a>, just that it will get <em>less</em> cold on average, over
time. In fact,
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00498-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research</a>
shows that the cold parts of the globe are warming much, much faster
than the rest.

<p>
<strong>Fact check</strong><strong>: That’s … true, actually.</strong>
“When the atmosphere warms, that means it can hold more water,” Matthew
Rodell, the deputy director of Earth sciences for hydrosphere,
biosphere, and geophysics at NASA,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/03/14/climate/extreme-weather-climate-change.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who
has made an extensive study of extreme drought and deluges</a>, told me.
That means there will be both more droughts <em>and </em>more rainfall,
even though the two phenomena might appear at a glance to contradict
each other.
</p>
<p>
“On the drought side of things, when the air is warmer, more water can
evaporate — can be pulled out of the land and out of the plants, into
the air, and then transported away,” Rodell explained. “So you have,
basically, more water being net removed from an area.” But water in the
air has to return to Earth, eventually, in the form of more — and often
extreme — rainfall.
</p>
<p>
Shouldn’t those two extremes effectively balance each other out? As
Rodell put it to me, “Floods and droughts are both catastrophes.” During
a drought, crops die and wells go dry. And while extreme rainfall might
refill an aquifer, “if it’s at the point of being extreme and there’s a
flood,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/libya-floods-storm-daniel-derna" target="_self">that’s
not good, either</a>.” Think about Libya, where extended heavy rains in
the summer of 2023 broke through dams and inundated towns, killing 4,300
people, displacing an estimated 44,800 more, and causing
<a href="https://www.trtafrika.com/africa/libya-allocates-dollar446m-for-post-flood-repairs-14939356" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">over
$60 million in damage</a>.
</p>
<p>
One last thing to mention here: While our ability to determine the
precise contribution of climate change to individual extreme weather
events is improving rapidly, that is, in some ways, beside the point.
Rodell explained that “in terms of the frequency, and looking at all
these events together and how they’ve changed over time, we’re seeing
that they’re increasing in number and severity in correlation with
global warming. That doesn’t mean you can say any particular event is
100% by global warming, but, I mean — statistically, it’s <em>extremely
unlikely</em> that this is just a coincidence.”

<p>
<strong>Fact check: While it’s true that the climate has always changed,
it hasn’t always changed like <em>this</em>.</strong> The rapid rise in
both atmospheric carbon dioxide <em>and </em>observed average surface
temperature since the Industrial Revolution can only be credited to
humans, and specifically to the burning of fossil fuels, which release
CO2, a heat-trapping gas. There is now
near-universal<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
scientific consensus</a> that the warming we’re witnessing has been
caused by human activity.
</p>
<p>
“The most popular climate myths are the ones that are simple and easy to
say,” as John Cook, a senior research fellow at Melbourne University’s
School of Psychological Sciences who’s made a
<a href="https://youtu.be/JuUz2AwoSko?list=PL1xbdG-NAkB1fAyNAWErM4uEXyduldiew&t=750" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">specialty</a>

<a href="https://youtu.be/H5kejSYPD7U" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">climate
disinformation</a>, told me. “It’s the single-cause fallacy, thinking
that only one thing can cause natural causes. But you can have other
things like human activity that also drive climate change,” Cook added.
</p>
<p>
Start digging into this kind of logic and it quickly falls apart. For
example, Trump’s argument is that the climate has changed naturally in
the past; therefore, it must be changing naturally now, as well. But,
Cook told me, the same logic could also be used to argue, <em>People
have died of cancer in the past; therefore, cigarettes don’t cause
cancer now</em>.

<strong>Fact check:</strong> For starters, <strong>Trump’s numbers are
orders of magnitude off the mark. </strong>The oceans are on track to
rise <em>3.5 feet to 7 feet</em> along America’s coastlines by 2100 —
well ahead of Trump’s schedule — according to
<a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/hazards/sealevelrise/sealevelrise-tech-report.html#:~:text=About%202%20feet%20(0.6%20meters,the%20end%20of%20this%20century." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an
independent assessment</a> conducted by federal scientific agencies.
Even if global carbon emissions had peaked in 2020
(<a href="https://www.iea.org/news/global-co2-emissions-rebounded-to-their-highest-level-in-history-in-2021https://www.iea.org/news/global-co2-emissions-rebounded-to-their-highest-level-in-history-in-2021" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">which
we know they did not</a>) and declined relatively rapidly thereafter,
the oceans would <em>still</em> probably rise more than 3 feet worldwide
by 2300 compared to their 2000 levels,
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-02985-8/tables/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">researchers
have found,</a> because so much heat is already trapped in the climate
system.
</p>
<p>
According to the
<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM_final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">latest
scientific report</a> from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, “sea level rise greater than 15 meters,” or 49 feet, by
the year 2300 “cannot be ruled out” in a high-emissions scenario.
</p>
<p>
While unlikely, 49 feet of sea-level rise would be catastrophic. Large
swaths of lower Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens would be completely
submerged, with waves lapping at the walls of Yankee Stadium and Citi
Field. The southern half of Florida would vanish (bye-bye, Mar-a-Lago!).
Countries like the Netherlands and Bangladesh would, literally,
disappear from the map.
</p>
<p>
As for that supposedly new oceanfront property Trump is so excited
about, scientists expect some

States by 2050 — not to mention that globally, some <em>230 million

<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66197366" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vowed</a>
in front of Congress last year. The situation is, however — and
unsurprisingly — <strong>more complicated than that</strong>.
</p>
<p>
At COP28 last year, the U.S. pledged $17.5 million to the U.N.’s “loss

from future climate disasters. While some outlets — including

<strong>Fact check:</strong> China, India, and Russia are all Paris

international climate mitigation efforts, <strong>that hardly means the
U.S. shouldn’t try to be cleaner</strong>.
</p>
<p>
But let’s take Trump at face value here. When asked to assess if the
Paris Agreement gives an unfair advantage to nations like China and
India, law professor Daniel Bodansky at the Arizona State University
College of Law pointed out
<a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/politics/politifact/2021/01/27/fact-check-paris-climate-agreement-easier-china-india-than-united-states/4276557001/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to
<em>USA Today</em></a> that “the United States is the second biggest
emitter of greenhouse gases in the world and has higher per capita
emissions than either China or India. It is misleading to point the
finger at China and India and label them as the real polluters.”
</p>
<p>
What about the bad air flowing to us “from Asia,” then? This isn’t total
nonsense. For one thing, we <em>do</em> all share the same atmosphere;
that’s kind of the whole point of the global movement to stop climate
change. But more concretely, yes, researchers have found that pollutants
from China can make their way to the Western U.S.
</p>
<p>
Here’s where it gets awkward: “An estimated 36% of manmade sulfur
dioxide, 27% of nitrogen oxide, 22% of carbon monoxide, and 17% of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_carbon" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">black

About a fifth of each of these was associated with products exported to

<p>
<strong>Fact check:</strong> If you ever want to feel ridiculous, try
asking a scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration if windmills are making whales “a little batty.”
</p>
<p>
NOAA actively studies how “sound, vessel, and other human activities”
impact marine life, Lauren Gaches, the director of NOAA Fisheries Public
Affairs, told me over email. “At this point, <strong>there is no
scientific evidence that noise resulting from offshore wind site
characterization surveys could potentially cause mortality of
whales</strong>,” she said.
</p>
<p>
An ongoing “unusual mortality event” for humpback whales has resulted in
200 whale deaths between 2016 and June 2023 along the Atlantic coast
from Maine to Florida — that much is true. But “there are no known links
between recent large whale mortalities and ongoing offshore wind
surveys,” Gaches told me.
<a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/marine-life-distress/frequent-questions-offshore-wind-and-whales" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NOAA’s
fact page</a> on whales and offshore wind explains that of “roughly 90
whales examined, about 40% had evidence of human interaction, either
ship strike or entanglement.”
</p>
<p>
There has been some chatter about underwater surveying work disrupting
whales, which
<a href="https://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/mar/mcbem-2014-01/other/mcbem-2014-01-submission-seismic-airgun-en.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">may
be true</a> in the case of oil and gas surveys, which use seismic air
guns to penetrate deep into the ocean floor. The surveying equipment
used for offshore wind is, by contrast, used in 15-second bursts and
limited to a specific area, “so the likelihood of an animal encountering
and coming right into that sound beam is quite low,” Erica Staaterman,
the deputy director for the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s Center
for Marine Acoustics, said on

NOAA-hosted call with the press</a> early last year.
</p>
<p>
As Ben Laws, the deputy chief of NOAA’s Permits and Conservation
Division in the Office of Protected Resources, said on the same call,
“There is no information that would support any suggestion that any of
the equipment that’s being used in support of wind development for these
site characterization surveys could directly lead to the death of a
whale.”

before</a> he ever ran for president. “Wind farms are killing many
thousands of birds,” reads one illustrative tweet

2012</a>. “They make hunters look like nice people!”
</p>
<p>
Lewis Grove is the director of wind and energy policy at the American
Bird Conservancy, and he told me that while it’s “not necessarily as
simple as Mr. Trump painted it out to be, <strong>wind turbines
absolutely kill birds</strong>.”
</p>
<p>
But the context here is extremely important. Jason Ryan, a spokesperson
for the American Clean Power Association, a leading renewable energy
trade group, pointed me to research from the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife
Service that shows wind farms “represent just
<a href="https://www.fws.gov/library/collections/threats-birds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">0.03%
of all human-related bird deaths in the U.S.</a>” Grove likewise told me
that, for the most part, bird deaths due to wind turbines do “not have
population-level impacts.”
</p>
<p>
There are exceptions, such as an infamous wind farm in California’s
Altamont Pass built in 1981 that “just happened to be in a place that
was really heavily used by golden eagles,” Grove told me. Because golden
eagle populations were already very low, having
<a href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/protecting_birds_of_prey_at_altamont_pass/pdfs/factsheet.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">100
or so</a> killed a year by turbines was “unsustainable.” Even in a case
like this, though, it behooves one to look at the whole picture: “They
found it was a few individual turbines that were causing the damage,”
Grove said. These days, around 60 golden eagles a year are killed in
Alameda County,
<a href="https://alamedapost.com/features/alameda-life/making-wind-energy-safer-for-golden-eagles/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the<em>
Alameda Post</em> reports</a>, and the operating company must pay steep
penalties for eagle deaths.
</p>
<p>
What’s more, “climate change is one of the greatest threats birds face,
with
<a href="https://www.audubon.org/climate/survivalbydegrees" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two-thirds
of North American species</a> at risk of extinction due to our warming
planet,” Jon Belak, senior manager of science and data analysis at The
National Audubon Society, told me in a statement. “We need to build more
wind and solar facilities to help slow the rise in global temperatures
and protect birds and their habitats from a changing climate.”
</p>
<p>
Wind farms may not have population-level impacts on birds, but fracking

<strong>Fact check:</strong> “I mean, <strong>it’s possible with any mix
of generation that if supply and demand aren’t equal, your TV will go
out</strong>. That’s just physics,” Kyri Baker, an assistant professor
of engineering at the University of Colorado, told me when I asked her
if Trump’s scenario had any merit. In other words, a power outage could
happen whether your electricity is coming from coal or natural gas or
anything else. The difference, she said, is that “wind is by nature
variable, intermittent. But it’s also not reliant on fuel like natural
gas or coal plants or even nuclear plants are.”
</p>
<p>
What happens on days when there is no wind? “Grids are extremely
regulated,” Baker explained to me. “There’s so many layers of redundancy
that aim <em>specifically</em> to not have [an outage] happen.” A grid
is made up of diverse electricity sources (for my visual learners,

need be, so service isn’t disrupted.

Battery storage is another huge part of this equation. While they’re
still fairly cutting-edge as climate technology goes, high-capacity

Of the energy sources we’re currently used to, nuclear is usually cited
as having the highest levelized cost of electricity — that is, it has
the highest average cost per unit of electricity generated after
construction, maintenance, and operation have been taken into account.
Peaker plants — gas-powered plants that run just during times of peak

<p>
<strong>Fact check:</strong> Trump has repeatedly slammed the Biden
administration for supposedly wanting to switch to “all-electric” tanks.
<strong>This is mostly false</strong>, though it has its roots in the
Army’s
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2022/02/10/army-military-green-climate-strategy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first-ever
climate strategy</a>, released early last year. In it, the Army stated
that it aims to electrify all noncombat vehicles by 2035 and some
tactical vehicles by 2050.
</p>
<p>
The reason the Army wants to go electric isn’t because of some woke
environmentalist agenda, though. “The primary reason the Army wants to
electrify its fighting vehicles is to reduce wartime casualties,”
<a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/us-armys-electric-tanks-on-hold-as-battery-technology-develops" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Bloomberg</em>
writes</a>. “An all-electric fleet would mean personnel wouldn’t have to
go on dangerous refueling missions that draw combat forces away from
fighting the enemy … [and] electric vehicles are also much quieter and
harder to spot on enemy surveillance systems because they generate so
little heat.”
</p>
<p>
Trump has also slammed the Air Force for
<a href="https://www.safie.hq.af.mil/Programs/Climate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its
climate action plan</a>, although the roots of his claim that Biden
wants to make jet fighters green by “losing 15% efficiency” are much
less clear. He may be referring to the Air Force’s

strategic reasons, since the Air Force reports 30% of the casualties in
Afghanistan came from attacks on fuel and water convoys. “We’re not

And it’s good for our country. I will approve the export terminals on my

<p>
<strong>Fact check: This is wrong in a number of ways.</strong> Let’s
take it from the top: First, Biden did not block the export of liquified
natural gas to other countries; he temporarily paused the approval of
new licenses to export LNG, including 17 that had been in the, er,
pipeline. The United States is already the top exporter of LNG in the
world, with output expected to double by the end of the decade from
projects that are already licensed and under construction. The LNG
licensing pause “will not impact our ability to continue supplying LNG
to our allies in the near-term,” the Biden administration has said;
current exports have been more than enough to meet Europe’s needs so
far, even accounting for the war in Ukraine.
</p>
<p>
The permitting process will resume once the Department of Energy has
updated its criteria for determining whether new LNG export terminals
are in the “public interest” once their climate impacts are considered.
</p>
<p>
Now, about those climate impacts: It’s true that natural gas burns
“cleaner” than coal, producing about 40% less carbon dioxide (and about
30% less than oil). But natural gas is also largely composed of methane,
“a climate-altering super pollutant,” Jeremy Symons, an environmental
and political analyst and strategist, told Heatmap.
</p>
<p>
While methane breaks down more quickly in the atmosphere than CO2, it
also traps more heat — about 80 times more heat over the course of 20
years. The process of liquifying natural gas not only requires
additional energy, it also introduces new opportunities for methane to
leak, adding to the fuel’s climate impacts. Once all those leaks have
been quantified, argues Cornell University researcher Robert Howarth,
LNG is not only not beneficial to the environment, it’s actually worse
than other fossil fuels. Howarth’s paper has not yet been peer-reviewed,
and some have questioned his conclusions in the past. But there’s no
question that building new LNG facilities will lock the U.S. into
producing planet-warming fuel for years to come.
</p>
<p>
LNG certainly isn’t “good for the environment” of the people who live
near fracking sites and export terminals, either, where health issues
are rampant. In addition to methane, LNG plants release volatile organic
compounds, which have been linked to higher instances of cancer, asthma,
and birth defects.

<em> “You have the highest energy costs in the entire country. In the

</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Fact check: </strong>Trump made these remarks after winning the
New Hampshire primary — and <strong>t</strong><strong>hey’re
wrong</strong>. For one thing, while energy <em>is</em> expensive in the
Granite State, New Hampshire’s Department of Energy says its energy
costs are
<a href="https://www.energy.nh.gov/energy-information/energy-new-hampshire" target="_blank">the
fifth-highest</a> in the lower 48.
</p>
<p>
There’s an even bigger fallacy in Trump’s statement, though: that
drilling can quickly lower energy prices. For one thing, oil from new
leases
<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/5-reasons-why-the-united-states-cant-drill-its-way-to-energy-independence/" target="_blank">doesn’t
hit the market</a> for at least four years, according to the Government
Accountability Office. (Offshore drilling takes even longer since
building the rigs alone can take two to three years.) As
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/19/1086925726/gas-prices-oil-crude-drilling" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NPR
explains</a>, there are also operational limits; drilling new wells is
“not as simple as turning a spigot and watching oil gush out.”
</p>
<p>
Much to the dismay of environmentalists, the Biden administration has
also been <a href="#drill">keeping pace</a> with Trump’s historic
drilling. In fact, as of 2024, the U.S. is producing more domestic crude
than
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=MCRFPUS2&f=M" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at
any point during Trump’s presidency</a>.
</p>
<p>
But even with all this new domestic crude, the U.S. is still susceptible
to fluctuations in the global price of oil. That’s partially because the
U.S. imports a different kind of oil than it exports — what those in the
trade call light, sweet crude, compared to the gunkier, heavy crude most
U.S. refineries are set up for. Reconfiguring refineries to handle the
light crude oil “could underserve some product markets and idle (or even
strand) the hundreds of billions of dollars invested in refinery
conversion capacity,” the American Petroleum Institute
<a href="https://www.api.org/news-policy-and-issues/blog/2018/06/14/why-the-us-must-import-and-export-oil" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warns</a>.
Plus, it would also take even more time.
</p>
<p>
All that means that the U.S. is stuck relying on importing and exporting
oil <em>even if </em>domestic production ramps up even more than it
already has. And that, in turn, means we’re at the mercy of fluctuations
in global energy costs, which remain out of the White House’s singular
control.
</p>
<p>
One more thing to note: “The oil industry can decide to produce more oil
whenever it wants,” the Center for American Progress, a liberal public
policy think tank,
<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/5-reasons-why-the-united-states-cant-drill-its-way-to-energy-independence/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explains</a>,
noting that the oil industry is sitting on
“<a href="https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/docs/2022-02/FY%202022%20APD%20Status%20Report%20December.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more
than 9,000</a> approved — but unused — drilling permits on federal
lands.” This is the base of
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/oil-companies-record-profits-2022-exxon-chevron/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
criticism</a> that the oil industry is raking in “unprecedented profits”
and burdening Americans with an artificially high cost of energy.

<p>
<strong>Fact check:</strong> Economists mostly agree that “energy

sense, <strong>Trump is correct.</strong> But in making this argument,
he inadvertently endorses the case for clean energy — since renewables

they are therefore considered

explicitly temporary and contingent on the country holding free and fair

decision</a> to cancel oil and gas leases in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge and block 13 million acres in the National Petroleum
Reserve in Alaska from new drilling. While that does qualify as a large
area in Alaska, the moves notably do not stop ConocoPhillips’
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/climate-president-bomb-biden-willow" target="_self">controversial
Willow drilling project</a> from going forward.
</p>
<p>
Trump further seems to be alluding to Biden’s campaign promise to not
approve any new drilling (“ <em>…anywhere in our states!</em>”), but
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-resume-oil-gas-drilling-public-land-despite-biden-campaign-pledge-2022-04-15/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that

<p>
<strong>Fact check:</strong> As someone who lives in a New York City
apartment, I would absolutely describe my dishwasher as “precious and
dear,” so that part is true. It is also true that,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/dishwashers-biden-conservatives-culture-war" target="_self">as
I explained last year</a>, rules proposed by the Biden administration
call for new dishwashers imported and made in the U.S. to use 34% less
water, or no more than 3.3 gallons, during their default cycles by 2027.
But <strong>it is not true that those dishwashers don’t work</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Energy-efficient dishwashers <em>can </em>take a long time to clean your
dishes; many cycles last more than two hours and some up to three. The
reason for this is pretty straightforward: In order to achieve the same
level of cleanliness as old, water- and energy-inefficient dishwashers,
new water- and energy-efficient dishwashers
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyOHcNcovYA&ab_channel=ApplianceVideo.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">need
to swish around longer</a>.
</p>
<p>
But the “default cycles” are the <em>only</em> dishwasher mode the
government restricts; “short cycle” modes, which require more water and
take less time, are still allowed on dishwashers sold in the U.S. and
aren’t regulated by the new rules. That fast mode just can’t be the
default.
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/dishwashers-trump-efficiency/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">As
<em>Wirecutter</em> writes</a>, “crappy cleaning performance and long
cycles aren’t an inevitable outcome of efficiency standards,” and “if
your dishwasher is slow and sucks (and a better detergent doesn’t fix
the problem), blame the company that built it.”
</p>
<blockquote>
<em>“Now their new thing is your heating systems in the house. They

<strong>Fact check: It’s really gas furnace systems that are,
technically speaking, dated.</strong> Gas furnaces were considered

in the 1920s and 1930s, while heat pump technology — which works by
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQaycSD5GWE&ab_channel=BCHydro" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">transferring</a>,
rather than generating, heat from indoors to outdoors and vice versa —
<a href="https://texascooppower.com/heat-pumps-are-back-and-worth-a-look/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">took
off in the 1970s</a> as a response to surging oil prices. Heat pumps can
be up to five times more efficient than fossil-fuel furnaces, according
to electrification advocacy group Rewiring America, which means that at
least 70% of people could save money on their energy bills by switching
from fossil fuel heaters, the group estimates.
</p>
<p>
The cost of a heat pump itself
<a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/reviews/hvac/heat-pump-cost" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">varies
widely</a> depending on size (how much house it has to heat), type
(geothermal vs. air source), and efficiency, then when you add in
factors like the cost to refit you existing HVAC system and the cost of
labor, well,
<a href="https://www.blocpower.io/posts/heat-pump-installation-cost-2023-prices-guide" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it
adds up</a>. While heat pumps aren’t cheap, they do at least serve as
both a furnace <em>and</em> an air conditioner, two appliances for the
price of one, an investment that can pay back over time, Rewiring
America said.

quietly extends Solaris 11.4 support until 2037</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Oracle has quietly extended paid support and upgrades for Solaris
11.4 to 2037 – three years past its previous deadline – and did the same
for earlier versions of the OS last year. ↫ Simon Sharwood at The
Register One of the biggest “what could have beens” of the past two
decades. Had Oracle not closed Solaris up after acquiring Sun, an open
source Solaris might’ve been something more tangible than what it is
today. Of course, Oracle gonna Oracle and they were always going to
screw things up, open source or not, but had Solaris stayed open we’d
have had a more concerted, centralised development effort instead of
what we have now, where the open source Solaris community is working off
the last OpenSolaris codebase from 14 years ago.</p>

<h2 id="new-renderers-for-gtk">New renderers for GTK</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Recently, GTK gained not one, but two new renderers: one for GL and
one for Vulkan. Since naming is hard, we reused existing names and
called them “ngl” and “vulkan”. They are built from the same sources,
therefore we also call them “unified” renderers. As mentioned already,
the two renderers are built from the same source. It is modeled to
follow Vulkan apis, with some abstractions to cover the differences
between Vulkan and GL (more specifically, GL 3.3+ and GLES 3.0+). This
lets us share much of the infrastructure for walking the scene graph,
maintaining transforms and other state, caching textures and glyphs, and
will make it easier to keep both renderers up-to-date and on-par. ↫ GTK

of interest to y’all.</p>

<p>But despite all this chaos and temptation, operating system vendors
knew better. To this day, they follow THE convention: checkboxes are
square, radio buttons are round. Maybe it was part of their internal
training. Maybe they had experienced art directors. Maybe it was just
luck. I don’t know — it doesn’t really matter — but — somehow — they
managed to stick to the convention. Until this day. Apple is the first
major operating system vendor who had abandoned a four-decades-long
tradition. Their new visionOS — for the first time in the history of
Apple — will have round checkboxes. ↫ Nikita Prokopov Unsightly. A lack

<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Last week, I turned on my PC, installed a Windows update, and
rebooted to find Microsoft Edge automatically open with the Chrome tabs
I was working on before the update. I don’t use Microsoft Edge
regularly, and I have Google Chrome set as my default browser.
Bleary-eyed at 9AM, it took me a moment to realize that Microsoft Edge
had simply taken over where I’d left off in Chrome. I couldn’t believe
my eyes. I never imported my data into Microsoft Edge, nor did I confirm
whether I wanted to import my tabs. But here was Edge automatically
opening after a Windows update with all the Chrome tabs I’d been working
on. I didn’t even realize I was using Edge at first, and I was confused
why all my tabs were suddenly logged out. ↫ Tom Warren at The Verge I
would never accept such disregard for users from my computer.</p>

<h2 id="garland-to-undergo-surgery-us-justice-department-says">Garland
to Undergo Surgery, US Justice Department Says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Attorney General Merrick Garland will undergo back
surgery this weekend and delegate his duties to the deputy attorney
general during the procedure, the Justice Department said Monday. </p>
<p>The news comes as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin returns to work at
the Pentagon following a hospitalization related to prostate cancer that
was criticized for being kept secret for days. </p>
<p>Garland, 71, will be under general anesthesia during the back
procedure on Saturday, which will last about 90 minutes and is
“minimally invasive,” said Xochitl Hinojosa, director of public affairs
at the Justice Department. He is expected to return home the same day,
she said. Garland will delegate his duties to Deputy Attorney General
Lisa Monaco shortly before, during and for a short time after the
procedure as he recovers from the anesthesia, the statement said. He is
expected to return to work the week of February 5. </p>
<p>Austin returned to the Pentagon on Monday after nearly a monthlong
absence. He underwent a surgical procedure for the cancer on December 22
and was released but was then admitted to intensive care days later
after experiencing extreme pain. He stayed there for two weeks but
didn’t inform the White House or his deputy until days later that he had
cancer, had surgery or returned to the hospital.  </p>
<p>Austin’s lack of disclosure prompted two ongoing reviews, as well as
changes in federal guidelines to ensure the White House will be informed
any time  Cabinet chiefs can’t carry out their jobs. The Justice
Department notified the White House of the plans to delegate his duties
under the new guidelines, White House spokeswoman Olivia Dalton
confirmed. </p>
<p>When Garland went in for a routine medical procedure in 2022, his
office also informed the public a week in advance and outlined how long
he was expected to be out and when he would return to work.</p>

<h2 id="credcheck-version-2.4-released">Credcheck version 2.4
released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
Grenoble - January 30, 2024
</p>
<h2>
PostgreSQL credcheck extension
</h2>
<p>
The credcheck PostgreSQL extension provides few general credential
checks, which will be evaluated during the user creation, during the
password change and user renaming. By using this extension, we can
define a set of rules:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
allow a specific set of credentials
</li>
<li>
reject a certain type of credentials
</li>
<li>
deny password that can be easily cracked
</li>
<li>
enforce use of an expiration date with a minimum of day for a password
</li>
<li>
define a password reuse policy
</li>
<li>
define the number of authentication failure allowed before a user is
banned
</li>
<li>
add a delay after all authentication failure
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This release is a maintenance release to fix a major issue with the
backup of the password history file with pgBackRest and adds an
authentication delay feature.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Add authentication delay feature to be able to add a pause on
authentication failure. Setting <code>credcheck.auth_delay_ms</code>
causes the server to pause for a given number of milliseconds before
reporting authentication failure. This makes brute-force attacks on
database passwords more difficult. This patch is purely a copy/paste
from the auth_delay extension just to limit the number of extensions to
preload. See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-delay.html for
more information about the origin of this feature.
</li>
<li>
Force size of file <code>$PGDATA/global/pg_password_history</code> to be
a multiple of 8192 to fix pgBackRest error caused by the error message:
“page misalignment in file /…/global/pg_password_history: file size 2604
is not divisible by page size 8192”
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Extension upgrade requires a PostgreSQL restart to reload the credcheck
library.

Paris 2024: Schedule published &amp; Call for lightning talks
launched</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
Hi,
</p>
<p>
The schedule for pgDay Paris 2024 on March 14 is now live and we are
really excited to share it with you. We have some great talks lined up
for you about everything Postgres - from Codd to community and from
logical decoding to LSM trees.
</p>
<p>
Check out the programme &amp; register now
<a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgdayparis2024/schedule">https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgdayparis2024/schedule</a>
</p>
<p>
But that’s not all!
</p>
<p>
The best news is that there’s still a chance for <strong>you</strong> to
be on stage! If you look at the schedule, you’ll notice we reserved a
slot for lightning talks because we know how much everyone loves them.
We also know how nerve-wracking it can be to sign up on the day and not
know until the last minute whether or not you’ll be speaking, so we’ve
decided to launch a separate lightning talk CFP. Whether you’re a
seasoned speaker or you’ve never been up on stage before, and whatever
your Postgres use-case, we want to hear from you!
</p>
<p>
Submissions (max 1 per speaker) should be sent by email to
lightning@pgday.paris.
</p>
<p>
The talk must be in English and no longer than 5 minutes.
</p>
<p>
The subject of your email should be your name followed by the title of
the talk (e.g. “Slonik: What Elephants do for Fun”). The body of the
email should contain a very short description of your talk (max 50
words)
</p>
<p>
We recommend you submit your lightning talk by 23 February as that’s
when we’ll do the first round of selections, with selected speakers
notified by 8 March. You can, however, submit your lightning talk right
up until the day of the conference in case slots are still available
</p>
<p>
We look forward to seeing you in Paris on March 14, The pgDay Paris Team
</p>

<h2 id="contexts-friction-and-distractions">Contexts, Friction and
Distractions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: Marginallia log</p>
<p>I get significantly more work done when I unplug my computer from the
Internet. It’s not that my productive output drops to zero when I’m
plugged in, but more like 70%. Despite many of the tools that I use
requiring a connection, and certainly the Internet containing a wealth
of information that might expedite my work, these benefits are
drastically outweighed by the wealth of distractions also available.
It’s very appealing, when the code is compiling or the docker containers
restarting, to sneak open a browser tab with hacker news, or the Χ
formerly known as Twitter, youtube, or something else to pass those
minutes.</p>

<h2
id="roring-ahead-using-ror-in-place-of-the-open-funder-registry">RORing
ahead: using ROR in place of the Open Funder Registry</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
A few months ago we announced our plan to
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/open-funder-registry-to-transition-into-research-organization-registry-ror/">deprecate
our support for the Open Funder Registry</a> in favour of using the ROR
Registry to support both affiliation and funder use cases. The feedback
we’ve had from the community has been positive and supports our members,
service providers and metadata users who are already starting to move in
this direction.
</p>
<p>
We wanted to provide an update on work that’s underway to make this
transition happen, and how you can get involved in working together with
us on this.
</p>
<p>
Overall, we are building more comprehensive support for ROR into
Crossref’s services. Some of this work is specifically to support using
ROR to identify funding organisations in place of funder registry IDs.
We have a number of parallel, complementary projects underway to support
different elements of this work:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
We are evolving our metadata schema so that we can collect ROR IDs in
places where we currently support the collection of Funder IDs.
</li>
<li>
We are analysing the coverage of Funder ID to ROR ID mappings and
testing the way we expose them in our APIs.
</li>
<li>
We are developing new matching strategies to match text strings to ROR
IDs.
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="1-schema-updates">
<ol type="1">
<li>Schema updates
</h2>
<p>
Everything flows from being able to get ROR IDs into the Crossref
metadata!
</p>
<p>
We are evolving our metadata schema so that we can collect ROR IDs in
places where we already support the collection of Funder IDs – for
instance, in
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/funder-registry/funding-data-overview/">the
funding section of the metadata for works</a> and in the funder section
for grants.
</p>
<p>
We’re working with members and service providers so that they can try
sending us this data via a pipeline our Labs team has built to test
schema updates before they go live. We are actively recruiting members
to help us test our new pipeline by providing sample XML for
registration. Planned metadata inputs and outputs are detailed in
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/164h3UtBQ2mHf5lH5ZS6c_Oh8OuraoaQPvXhNNO3-Ko8/edit" target="_blank">Including
ROR as a funder identifier in your metadata (metadata prototyping
instructions)</a>, we’d encourage you to provide feedback on these in
the document, ideally in the next two weeks. We’re aiming to release an
updated schema that supports these changes in Q1 2024.
</p>
<h2 id="2-modelling-ror-idfunder-id-mappings-in-our-metadata-model">
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Modelling ROR ID/Funder ID mappings in our metadata model
</h2>
<p>
We have integrated the ROR registry into our evolving metadata model,
and we have started work to integrate the Funder Registry. The aim is to
create more flexibility in how Crossref’s metadata can be supplemented
and queried, and give more clarity as to which party asserted or created
a metadata element.
</p>
<p>
We’re working on an early iteration of how the model handles ROR IDs,
funder IDs and their equivalencies. Once we have something to share,
we’ll welcome community feedback on this approach and on the metadata
model in general.
</p>
<h2 id="3-developing-new-matching-strategies-to-match-text-strings-to-ror-ids">
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Developing new matching strategies to match text strings to ROR IDs
</h2>
<p>
Ideally, everyone would always use persistent identifiers to exchange
information about contributor and awardee affiliations, organisations
related to works, as well as funders supporting the research. In
practice, this information is often exchanged as data without
identifiers, such as affiliation strings (e.g. “University of Virginia,
Charlottesville, VA”), funder names, or even funding acknowledgements
(e.g. “Funding and support generously provided by the Ford Foundation”).
In such situations, a good metadata matching strategy can help map these
to persistent identifiers.
</p>
<p>
Currently, we are focused on developing reliable strategies for matching
affiliation strings to ROR IDs. In the future, we will adapt the
strategies to support funder names and funding acknowledgements as well.
All the strategies will be rigorously evaluated using real-life data. We
will make the strategies, as well as the evaluation datasets and
evaluation results, publicly available for anyone to use. If you are
interested in collaborating on the development or the evaluation of the
matching strategies, <a href="mailto:labs@crossref.org">please get in
touch</a>!
</p>
<p>
In the future, we might also apply some of the new matching strategies
at Crossref, to the metadata our members send us. This would allow us to
insert matched identifiers to the metadata to better connect
organisations with other items in the scholarly record. We already have
a process that matches the names of funders supporting research against
the Funder Registry and enriches the metadata with matched Funder
Registry IDs. Developing and evaluating reliable matching strategies
will allow us to modify this process to use ROR IDs instead, and extend
it to support other use cases, such as contributor affiliations.
</p>
<h2 id="what-will-the-transition-mean-for-you">
What will the transition mean for you?
</h2>
<p>
We do recommend that you begin looking at what it will take to integrate
ROR into your systems and workflows for identifying funders. Talk to
your service providers about this to ready them for this change. To
reiterate the point from the earlier post, in the short term, and even
in the medium term, Funder IDs aren’t going away and the Funder IDs will
continue to resolve – they are persistent, after all. Eventually,
however, the Funder Registry will cease to be updated, so any new
funders will only be registrable in Crossref metadata with ROR IDs.
Legacy Funder IDs and their mapping to ROR IDs will be maintained, so if
Crossref members submit a legacy Funder ID, it will get mapped to a ROR
ID automatically. Note, too, that Crossref is committed to maintaining
the current funder API endpoints until ROR IDs become the predominant
identifier for newly registered content. We also know that there are
questions that we’ll want to tackle with the community as we all make
progress, some we know and some we don’t know. With that in mind:
</p>
<h2 id="tell-us-what-you-need">
Tell us what you need!
</h2>
<p>
We want to hear from you! We have set up several channels of
communication meant to ensure that you can tell both ROR and Crossref
what will make this transition easier for you and that you can get
answers to your questions.
</p>
<p>
First, we are conducting a series of Open Funder Registry user
interviews designed to deepen our understanding of where Funder IDs are
being used in workflows and systems. Write
<a href="mailto:community@ror.org">community@ror.org</a> if you’d like
to participate in these interviews to show and tell us how you’re using
Funder IDs.
</p>
<p>
Second, in 2024, we will be running a follow-up to the funding data
workshop we ran in June 2023. Please get in touch if your organisation
would be interested in participating in the discussion.
