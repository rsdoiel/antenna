## Elon Musk’s transgender daughter, Vivian Wilson, speaks in first interview

<p>[<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/elon-musk-transgender-daughter-vivian-wilson-interview-rcna163665">David Ingram at NBC News</a>]</p><blockquote><p>"Vivian Jenna Wilson, the transgender daughter of Elon Musk, said Thursday in her first interview that he was an absent father who was cruel to her as a child for being queer and feminine."</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.threads.net/@vivllainous/post/C91xDGJSUX_">Her full Threads thread is worth reading</a>. She seems to have her head screwed on correctly and comes across as a far better person than the father she disowned.</p><p>On puberty blockers, she says:</p><blockquote><p>“They save lives. Let’s not get that twisted. They definitely allowed me to thrive.”</p></blockquote><p>That's really the kicker with Musk's current nonsense. Lives <em>are</em> at stake, and while his rhetoric might soothe whatever it is inside him that is hurt by his child disowning him for being a bigot, taking it to the national policy stage and endangering vulnerable communities is far from okay.</p><p>It's also a wild distraction when the valuations of his companies are at risk. Privately, investors and partners have to be up in arms: this is not what he needs to be concentrating on. In effect, one of the world's richest men is having such a public personality crisis that it's putting the well-being of both a very vulnerable group <em>and</em> his wealthy backers at risk.</p>

Several other galaxies, located relatively nearby to this one, are just beyond the frame of this image; one is close enough that gravitational interaction […]

<hr />
<h2>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</h2>
<p>I am originally from Pennsylvania, went to school in Arizona, and ended up in Dallas, Texas by way of Florida, Washington DC, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. I studied Psychology and planned on pursuing graduate studies in organizational psychology, but ended up in software fairly quickly, within about a year of graduating. I was a developer for over a decade, and then a CTO for almost another decade. I'm currently looking for an opportunity where I can provide value to a business doing good in the world.</p>
<p>I used to make music but haven't done much of that for about 10 years. I ride my bicycle as often as possible, usually a few times a week. And I write on my blog!</p>
<h2>What's the story behind your blog?</h2>
<p>I've always been interested in the ideas around Personal Knowledge Management, so when I first saw Blogger and started blogging in 2001 I thought of it as a public notebook. It still serves that purpose. It was originally danielsjourney.com (still have the domain). I eventually changed to daniel.industries.</p>
<p>My peak readership was during the blogging boom of the 2000s, which coincided with my move to Bosnia, which people seemed to be interested in.</p>
<h2>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</h2>
<p>I use Notion for "capture" and have about 18 ideas in there. I have additional less-formed ideas tagged in my Logseq notes. I have 19 posts in a drafts folder with another 516 stashed in there from private writing websites I participated in a years ago. In theory, I will someday get the good ones imported into the canonical notebook, but at this rate, it might never happen.</p>
<p>I try to write and publish in one sitting, otherwise the post might never get finished. I'm not afraid of editing a post after I've published it, though. It's my history, I can rewrite it if I want.</p>
<p>I also have <a href="https://daniel.industries/writing/">writing</a> (for stories and articles) and <a href="https://daniel.industries/music/">music</a> sections on the site. I plan on adding a "projects" page as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://daniel.industries/blog/">The blog</a> currently has 3417 posts. I posted much more early on (2001-2008), before Twitter and (some) maturity that came with age and experience...and I had a lot more time for it back then.</p>
<h2>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</h2>
<p>It's less about my physical environment and more about my mental and emotional environment. The other reason I've blogged less in the last 14 years is that my life allows for less quiet time for thinking. I will have good ideas and make interesting connections while riding my bike, or in the shower, or right before falling asleep, but as my life has become more full with family and responsibilities, I find not many of those ideas make it onto a page anywhere (yet alone become coherent enough to go on the website).</p>
<h2>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</h2>
<p>I use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> with a Ruby Rakefile I brought with me from back when I used a gem called "Octopress" (which has been abandoned), which adds quality-of-life command line tools for managing posts, building, and publishing. I've also written a "backlink" plugin for Jekyll (see <a href="https://www.daniel.industries/2023/01/29/really-basic-backlinks-in-jekyll/">Really Basic Backlinks in Jekyll</a>).</p>
<p>While I have used Jekyll for over 10 years, before that I used Blogger, Moveable Type, WordPress, LiveJournal, and multiple versions of my own PHP CMS system (see <a href="https://daniel.industries/2017/12/26/swim-stock-take-part-2/">SWIM Stock-take Part 2</a>). But I've been a static site generator person for a long time. I think 11ty is probably better at this point, but so far I haven't felt the need to move off Jekyll.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.daniel.industries/2024/02/29/to-find-an-alternative-to-wordpress-just-go-back-to-the-beginning/">To Find an Alternative to Wordpress, Just Go Back to the Beginning</a>.</p>
<p>I've hosted on DreamHost since forever. I've had my domains with Hover for a long time.</p>
<h2>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</h2>
<p>Static site generators seem to be all the rage these days, for good reason. Having everything as a flat file you can manage via source control and easily move around, search, mass update from your text editor of choice...it's better than having everything locked into a database in the cloud (or even on your computer), even if the product allows for easy exports. See <a href="https://www.daniel.industries/2018/08/14/web-artifact-permanence/">Web Artifact Permanence</a>.</p>
<h2>Financial question since the Web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost, or does it generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising personal blogs?</h2>
<p>The hosting is somewhere between $100-200 per year (I was kept at a lower price for a while, and I think that is over soon). I could host on GitHub or similar for free, but I have a handful of sites I host on DreamHost, so it is just easier to manage them all in one place.</p>
<p>I was bullish on tools that would allow individual artists to monetize their work without the need for middlemen, I even ran a nonprofit from 2003-2005 (see <a href="https://www.daniel.industries/2016/03/15/goodbye-integration-research/">Goodbye Integration Research Dot Org</a>) that was working on exactly that problem. I was excited when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9NjntTUJ1Q">Jack Conte first talked about Patreon at XOXO</a> (I was there in person--and it is still a good talk). Now we're there, and Patreon has to enshittify to appease investors, and Substack has to harbor fascists and pop modals in my face all the time, and I'm not so sure about the entire idea. I think it is better to just have something you can sell. It's hard. I think if you don't <em>have</em> to monetize your online work, that's better. There are too many pseudo-intellectual influencers out there, and too few Kottkes, <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/">Popovas</a>, or <a href="https://www.joanwestenberg.com/">Westenbergs</a>.</p>
<p>Those of us just hanging out in our digital living rooms on the cozy web are doing ok without having to perform for our audience.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Keeping a personal blog in 2017 feels relatively futile. But while everyone else is <del>storing</del> throwing their stories, artifacts, thoughts, and meanings into the stream for others to consume on their phones while taking a dump or bored at lunch or while consuming some other media entirely, those of us who store our work on <em>actual domains</em> do it for ourselves--and our legacy. And while permalinks may--and do--rot faster than last week's bananas, the content is still <em>here</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Creating content on the internet and actually owning all of that content and retaining complete control over that content is still one of the most culturally radical things one can do. Sure, the marketers of the world will tell you you’re wasting your time, but that is only if your horizon for meaningful impact in the world has shortened to the amount of time a news story remains in your social network feed.</p>

## French trains hit by sabotage

date: 2024-07-26, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Just as the Olympics are getting underway in Paris, the French train network has been hit by arson attacks, causing major delays and disruption. The incident will put even more focus on security at the games, which is already extremely tight. Then, we&#8217;ll look at how AI is being used to help make athletes&#8217; lives easier and scoring more accurate at this year&#8217;s Games.</p>

## Trump Is Sort of Right About the Green New Deal

date: 2024-07-26, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mjk3NDA3My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MDEzMjc0OH0.bOrvEXPC8h42aeflraOM1xZPu-VZrpjglRZio_sl0RE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	“They’ve spent trillions of dollars on things having to do with the Green New Scam. It’s a scam,” said Donald Trump in his recent convention speech. His running mate J.D. Vance echoed the sentiment, saying in his speech that the country needs “a leader who rejects Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s Green New Scam.”
</p><p>
	To get the reference, you would have had to understand that they were talking about the Green New Deal — which most Americans probably recall dimly, 
	<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2019/11/27/americans-like-green-new-deals-goals-they-reject-paying-trillions-reach-them/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>if at all</u></a> — and have some sense of both what was in it and why you shouldn’t like it. Neither Trump nor Vance explained or elaborated; it was one of many attacks at the Republican convention that brought cheers from the delegates but were likely all but incomprehensible to voters who aren’t deeply versed in conservative memes and boogeymen.
</p><p>
	But here’s the irony. The Green New Deal never made the transition from a general statement of goals to a concrete and comprehensive policy plan. It wasn’t enacted through Congress. And today, most Democrats, even those who supported it in the past, seldom mention it by name. Yet without too many people noticing, the Green New Deal has been enormously successful.
</p><p>
	From the beginning, it was envisioned as both a set of policy objectives and a public relations campaign, starting with the name. By invoking Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal, its advocates intended to communicate three essential messages. First, climate change is an urgent crisis on the scale of the Great Depression, one that demands a government response without delay. Second, the plan itself is hugely ambitious, seeking to marshal vast resources across multiple federal agencies to confront the problem. And third, the programs it envisions would be as transformative and lasting in their effects as those of the New Deal, putting millions to work, creating economic security, and providing direct benefits to Americans’ lives.
</p><p>
	But the plan itself was not really a plan at all. 
	<a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hres109/BILLS-116hres109ih.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The legislation</u></a> filed in 2019 by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey is a mere 14 pages long. It articulates five goals:
</p><p>
<strong>1. </strong>Achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions<br/>
<strong>2.</strong> Creating millions of high-wage jobs<br/>
<strong>3.</strong> Investing in sustainable infrastructure<br/>
<strong>4. </strong>Securing clean air and water, climate and community resiliency, healthy food, access to nature, and a sustainable environment<br/>
<strong>5. </strong>Promoting environmental justice
</p><p>
	The rest of the document name-checks a variety of areas where future programs will be targeted (manufacturing, housing, transportation, agriculture, etc.) and principles those programs should embody (support for unions, community involvement, opposition to corporate monopolies). In the years since, Ocasio-Cortez and Markey, along with other advocates, have attached the Green New Deal name to other, more detailed proposals (e.g. the 
	<a href="https://ocasio-cortez.house.gov/media/press-releases/ocasio-cortez-sanders-ramirez-reintroduce-green-new-deal-public-housing-act" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Green New Deal for Public Housing Act</u></a>).
</p><p>
	So not only does the Green New Deal remain somewhat abstract and hypothetical, most Democrats don’t even bring it up anymore. Which is why it sounds so absurd when Republicans attack it as though it were an enacted law; every time the crumbling Texas energy grid fails, foes of the clean energy transition 
	<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/feb/17/tucker-carlson/tucker-carlson-falsely-blames-green-new-deal-wind-/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rush to Fox News</u></a> to say the Green New Deal is the culprit.
</p><p>
	If you wanted to be generous, you could say the Republican critics are not lying, just using the phrase “Green New Deal” — or in Trump and Vance’s formulation, “Green New Scam” — as a shorthand to refer to any and all efforts to address climate change. In that sense, they might actually be on to something.
</p><p>
	To understand why, we should go back to the Green New Deal’s high point as a topic of political debate: the 2020 Democratic presidential primary campaign. Most of the two dozen Democrats running for the nomination 
	<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/climate-change/green-new-deal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>supported</u></a> it, and many — including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Kirsten Gillibrand, and <a href="https://kamalaharris.medium.com/green-new-deal-2699b33ba666" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Kamala Harris</u></a> — were cosponsors of the legislation. When Joe Biden <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2019/06/04/joe-biden-embraces-green-new-deal-he-releases-climate-plan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>released</u></a> his first campaign climate plan in 2019, it read, “Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face.” A year later he put out <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-set-to-offer-newly-ambitious-climate-goals/2020/07/14/39ced8b8-c578-11ea-b037-f9711f89ee46_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an updated plan</u></a> that backed away from the Green New Deal moniker but won praise from climate advocates for its ambition, including pledges to spend $2 trillion and reduce carbon emissions from power plants to zero by 2035.
</p><p>
	That change foreshadowed where most elected officials in the Democratic Party would move: Most of them wound up setting aside the Green New Deal 
	<em><em>name</em></em>, but they adopted its policy goals. What was originally thought by many to be a pie-in-the-sky idea advanced by those on the left edge of the party became something almost any Democrat with serious ambitions has to be on board with, however they might describe it. Democratic senators and governors may not all agree on every particular, but they have come around to the Green New Deal’s fundamental approach: <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-climate-policy" target="_self"><u>aggressive, ambitious government action</u></a> on climate, with the emphasis on carrots rather than sticks to produce tangible benefits the public will support.
</p><p>
	And just as Green New Deal advocates hoped, Democrats have not allowed Republicans to sucker them into endless arguments about cost. When Republicans make preposterous claims (for instance, 
	<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/it-s-true-kamala-harris-was-an-original-backer-of-the-green-new-deal/ar-BB1pRl7t" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>that it will cost</u></a> $100 trillion to implement all the plan’s profligate schemes), Democrats tend to dismiss it and move on, accepting that climate action entails investing money up front, and that it’s worth it.
</p><p>
	As for Biden, as he heads toward the end of his presidency he’s gotten lots of deserved praise for his commitment and achievements in addressing climate. While this might not be the way he would describe it, there’s no question that between the Inflation Reduction Act, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the efforts of agencies including the EPA and Department of Energy, he has made progress on all five of the Green New Deal’s goals.
</p><p>
	Net-zero emission targets? 
	<a href="https://www.sustainability.gov/federalsustainabilityplan/emissions.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Check</u></a>. Focus on well-paid green jobs? <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-300000-clean-energy-jobs_n_6679b2a6e4b097620199055e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Check</u></a>. Sustainable infrastructure? <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/bipartisan-infrastructure-law/fact-sheet-climate-and-resilience-bipartisan-infrastructure-law" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Check</u></a>. Clean air and water? <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-suite-standards-reduce-pollution-fossil-fuel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Check</u></a>. Environmental justice? <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/21/politics/environmental-justice-biden/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Check</u></a>. One might question whether the steps his administration has taken in these areas have been effective or sufficient, but no one can say Biden hasn’t pursued the Green New Deal’s objectives.
</p><p>
	The Green New Deal may not have been signed into law in its pure form, but it did what its advocates hoped: It captured the conversation around climate and was adopted to a great extent by an entire political party. And much of what it sought 
	<em><em>has</em></em> found its way into law and policy. So while Trump may call it a scam, it looks a lot like a triumph.

## Former US diplomat and author Martin Indyk dies at 73

date: 2024-07-26, from: VOA News USA

NORWICH, Conn. — Veteran diplomat Martin S. Indyk, an author and leader at prominent U.S. think tanks who devoted years to finding a path toward peace in the Middle East, died Thursday. He was 73.


His wife, Gahl Hodges Burt, confirmed in a phone call that he died from complications of esophageal cancer at the couple's home in New Fairfield, Connecticut.


The Council on Foreign Relations, where Indyk had been a distinguished fellow in U.S. and Middle East diplomacy since 2018, called him a "rare, trusted voice within an otherwise polarized debate on U.S. policy toward the Middle East."


A native of Australia, Indyk served as U.S. ambassador to Israel from 1995 to 1997 and from 2000 to 2001. He was special envoy for the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations during former President Barack Obama's administration, from 2013 to 2014.


When he resigned in 2014 to join The Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, it had symbolized the latest failed effort by the U.S. to forge an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. He continued as Obama’s special adviser on Mideast peace issues.


"Ambassador Indyk has invested decades of his extraordinary career to the mission of helping Israelis and Palestinians achieve a lasting peace. It’s the cause of Martin’s career, and I’m grateful for the wisdom and insight he’s brought to our collective efforts," then-Secretary of State John Kerry said at the time, in a statement.


In a May 22 social media post on X, amid the continuing war in Gaza, Indyk urged Israelis to "wake up," warning them their government "is leading you into greater isolation and ruin" after a proposed peace deal was rejected. Indyk also called out Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in June on X, accusing him of playing "the martyr in a crisis he manufactured," after Netanyahu accused the U.S. of withholding weapons that Israel needed.


"Israel is at war on four fronts: with Hamas in Gaza; with Houthis in Yemen; with Hezbollah in Lebanon; and with Iran overseeing the operations," Indyk wrote on June 19. "What does Netanyahu do? Attack the United States based on a lie that he made up! The Speaker and Leader should withdraw his invitation to address Congress until he recants and apologizes."


Indyk also served as special assistant to former President Bill Clinton and senior director for Near East and South Asian affairs at the National Security Council from 1993 to 1995. He served as assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs in the U.S. Department of State from 1997 to 2000.


Besides serving at Brookings and the Council on Foreign Relations, Indyk worked at the Center for Middle East Policy and was the founding executive director of The Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Indyk's successor at the Washington Institute called him "a true American success story."


"A native of Australia, he came to Washington to have an impact on the making of American Middle East Policy and that he surely did -- as pioneering scholar, insightful analyst and remarkably effective policy entrepreneur," Robert Satloff said. "He was a visionary who not only founded an organization based on the idea that wise public policy is rooted in sound research, he embodied it."


Indyk wrote or co-wrote multiple books, including Innocent Abroad: An Intimate Account of American Peace Diplomacy in the Middle East and Master of the Game: Henry Kissinger and the Art of Middle East Diplomacy, which was published in 2021.

## Rockets launched at bases hosting US troops in Iraq and Syria

date: 2024-07-26, from: VOA News USA

Baghdad — Several rockets were launched Thursday and Friday against bases hosting troops from the U.S.-led anti-jihadist coalition in Iraq and Syria, security officials and a war monitor said.


Such attacks were frequent early in the war between Israel and Hamas Palestinian militants in Gaza but since then have largely halted.


"Four rockets fell in the vicinity" of Ain al-Assad base in Anbar province, an Iraqi security source said.


Another security official said an attack occurred with "a drone and three rockets" that fell close to the base perimeter.


A United States official said initial reports indicated that projectiles landed outside the base without causing injuries or damage to the base.


All sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media.


At least one rocket also fell near a base of the coalition in the Conoco gas field in Deir Ezzor province of eastern Syria, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor.


The Observatory said a blast was heard in the area but there were no immediate reports of casualties.


The rocket was fired from "zones under the control of pro-Iranian militia" groups, said the monitor, which relies on sources inside Syria.


There was no immediate claim of responsibility for either attack.


Iran-backed armed groups in Iraq have largely halted similar attacks on U.S.-backed troops in recent months.


The latest attack come after a security meeting this week between Iraqi and U.S. officials in Washington on the future of the international anti-jihadist coalition in Iraq. Iran-backed groups have demanded a withdrawal.


The U.S. Defense Department said Wednesday "the delegations reached an understanding on the concept for a new phase of the bilateral security relationship."


This would include "cooperation through liaison officers, training, and traditional security cooperation programs."


On July 16, two drones were launched against Ain al-Assad base, with one exploding inside without causing injuries or damage. A senior security official in Baghdad said at the time he believed the attack was meant to "embarrass" the Iraqi government before the security meeting.


For more than three months, as regional tensions soared over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, United States troops were targeted by rockets and drones more than 175 times in the Middle East, mainly in Iraq and Syria.


The Islamic Resistance of Iraq, a loose alliance of Iran-backed groups, claimed the majority of the attacks, saying they were in solidarity with Gaza Palestinians.


In January, a drone strike blamed on those groups killed three U.S. soldiers in a base in Jordan. In retaliation, U.S. forces launched dozens of strikes against Tehran-backed fighters.


Since then, attacks against U.S. troops have largely halted.


Baghdad has sought to defuse tensions, engaging in talks with Washington on the future of the U.S.-led coalition's mission in Iraq.


The U.S. military has around 2,500 troops in Iraq and 900 in Syria with the international coalition.


The coalition was deployed to Iraq at the government's request in 2014 to help combat the Islamic State group, which had taken over vast swathes of Iraq and neighboring Syria.


Islamic State remnants still carry out attacks and ambushes in both countries.

## Barack and Michelle Obama endorse Kamala Harris

date: 2024-07-26, from: VOA News USA

ATLANTA  — Former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama have endorsed Kamala Harris in her White House bid, giving the vice president the expected but still crucial backing of the nation's two most popular Democrats.


The endorsement, announced Friday morning in a video showing Harris accepting a joint phone call from the former first couple, comes as Harris continues to build momentum as the party's likely nominee after President Joe Biden's decision to end his reelection bid and endorse his second-in-command against Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump.


It also highlights the friendship and potentially historic link between the nation's first Black president and the first woman, first Black woman and first person of Asian descent to serve as vice president, who is now vying to break those same barriers at the presidential rank.


"We called to say Michelle and I couldn't be prouder to endorse you and do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office," the former president told Harris, who is shown taking the call as she walks backstage at an event, trailed by a Secret Service agent.


Said Michelle Obama, "I can't have this phone call without saying to my girl, Kamala, I am proud of you.




"This is going to be historic," she added.


Harris, who has known the Obamas since before his election in 2008, thanked them for their friendship and said she looks forward to "getting there, being on the road" with them in the three-month blitz before Election Day on November 5.


"We're gonna have some fun with this too, aren't we?" Harris said.


The Obamas are perhaps the last major party figures to endorse Harris formally — a reflection of the former president's desire to remain, at least publicly, a party elder operating above the fray. The Obamas remain prodigious fundraising draws and popular surrogates at large campaign events for Democratic candidates.


According to an Associated Press survey, Harris already has secured the public support of a majority of delegates to the Democratic National Convention, which begins August 19 in Chicago. The Democratic National Committee expects to hold a virtual nominating vote that would, by August 7, make Harris and a yet-to-be-named running mate the official Democratic ticket.


Biden endorsed Harris within an hour of announcing his decision last Sunday to end his campaign amid widespread concern about the 81-year-old president's ability to defeat Trump. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, House Minority Whip Jim Clyburn, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton followed in the days after.


The Obamas, however, trod carefully as Harris secured the delegate commitments, made the rounds among core Democratic constituencies and raised more than $120 million. The public caution tracks how the former president handled the weeks between Biden's debate debacle against Trump and the president's eventual decision to end his campaign: Obama was a certain presence in the party's maneuvers, but he operated quietly.


Barack Obama's initial statement after Biden's announcement did not mention Harris. Instead, he spoke generically about coming up with a nominee to succeed Biden: "I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges," the former president wrote.


Both Obamas campaigned separately for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020, including large rallies on the closing weekends before Election Day. They delivered key speeches at the Democrats' convention in 2020, a virtual event because of the coronavirus pandemic. The former president's speech was especially notable because he unveiled a full-throated attack on Trump as a threat to democracy, an argument that endures as part of Harris' campaign.

## US arrests cartel leaders 'El Mayo' Zambada and son of 'El Chapo'

date: 2024-07-26, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, a longtime leader of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, and Joaquín Guzmán López, a son of another infamous cartel leader, were arrested by U.S. authorities in Texas on Thursday, the U.S. Justice Department said.


A leader of the powerful Sinaloa cartel for decades alongside Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán, Zambada is one of the most notorious drug traffickers in the world and known for running the cartel's smuggling operations while keeping a lower profile.


A Mexican federal official told The Associated Press that Zambada and Guzmán López arrived in the United States on a private plane and turned themselves in to authorities. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized discuss the matter.


The U.S. government had offered a reward of up to $15 million for information leading to the capture of Zambada, who eluded authorities for decades.


Zambada and Guzmán López oversaw the trafficking of "tens of thousands of pounds of drugs into the United States, along with related violence," FBI Director Christopher Wray said, adding that now they will "face justice in the United States."


"Fentanyl is the deadliest drug threat our country has ever faced, and the Justice Department will not rest until every single cartel leader, member, and associate responsible for poisoning our communities is held accountable," Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.


Mexican authorities didn't immediately comment on the arrests.




U.S. officials have been seeking Zambada's capture for years, and he has been charged in a number of U.S. cases. He was charged in February in the Eastern District of New York with conspiring to manufacture and distribute the synthetic opioid. Prosecutors said he was continuing to lead the Sinaloa cartel, "one of the most violent and powerful drug trafficking organizations in the world."


Zambada, one of the longest-surviving capos in Mexico, was considered the cartel's strategist, more involved in day-to-day operations than his flashier and better-known boss, "El Chapo" Guzmán, who was sentenced to life in prison in the U.S. in 2019 and is the father of Guzmán López.


Zambada is an old-fashioned capo in an era of younger kingpins known for their flamboyant lifestyles of club-hopping and brutal tactics of beheading, dismembering and even skinning their rivals. While Zambada has fought those who challenged him, he is known for concentrating on the business side of trafficking and avoiding gruesome cartel violence that would draw attention.


In an April 2010 interview with the Mexican magazine Proceso, he acknowledged that he lived in constant fear of going to prison and would contemplate suicide rather than be captured.


"I'm terrified of being incarcerated," Zambada said. "I'd like to think that, yes, I would kill myself."


The interview was surprising for a kingpin known for keeping his head down, but he gave strict instructions on where and when the encounter would take place, and the article gave no hint of his whereabouts.


Zambada reputedly won the loyalty of locals in his home state of Sinaloa and neighboring Durango through his largess, sponsoring local farmers and distributing money and beer in his birthplace of El Alamo.


Although little is known about Zambada's early life, he is believed to have gotten his start as an enforcer in the 1970s.


By the early 1990s, he was a major player in the Juarez cartel, transporting tons of cocaine and marijuana.


Zambada started gaining the trust of Colombian traffickers, allegiances that helped him come out on top in the cartel world of ever-shifting alliances. Eventually he became so powerful that he broke off from the Juarez cartel, but still managed to keep strong ties with the gang and avoided a turf war. He also developed a partnership with "El Chapo" Guzman that would take him to the top of the Sinaloa Cartel.


Zambada's detention follows some important arrests of other Sinaloa cartel figures, including one of his sons and another son of "El Chapo" Guzmán, Ovidio Guzmán López. Zambada's son pleaded guilty in U.S. federal court in San Diego in 2021 to being a leader in the Sinaloa cartel.




In recent years, Guzman's sons have led a faction of the cartel known as the little Chapos, or "Chapitos" that has been identified as a main exporter of fentanyl to the U.S. market.


They were seen as more violent and flamboyant than Zambada. Their security chief was arrested by Mexican authorities in November.


Ovidio Guzmán López was arrested and extradited to the U.S. last year. He pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges in Chicago in September.


Mike Vigil, former head of international operations for the DEA, said Zambada's arrest is important but unlikely to have much impact on the flow of drugs to the U.S. Joaquín Guzmán López was the least influential of the four sons who made up the Chapitos, Vigil said.


"This is a great blow for the rule of law, but is it going to have an impact on the cartel? I don't think so," Vigil said.


"It's not going to have a dent on the drug trade because somebody from within the cartel is going to replace him," Vigil said.

## US presidential election energizes fast-growing Indian American community

date: 2024-07-26, from: VOA News USA

washington — U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris' meteoric rise to the top of the Democratic Party's presidential ticket has energized many Indian Americans, raising the fast-growing community's political profile and sparking widespread excitement.


Harris, who is of Indian and Jamaican descent, appears set to become the first female presidential nominee of color after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race on Sunday. But the fervor isn't solely about her nomination.


Many Indian Americans, regardless of political leanings, are equally electrified to see other notable figures of Indian descent in the national spotlight: Usha Vance, the wife of Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance, as well as former presidential candidates Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy.


"I'm very proud that Indian Americans are making it on every stage," said Shaker Narasimhan, chair and founder of AAPI Victory Fund, a super PAC focused on mobilizing Asian American and Pacific Islander voters and supporting Democratic candidates.




Narasimhan recalled being on a call with about 130 people when news broke that Biden had dropped his presidential bid and endorsed Harris.


"Everything lit up, literally: the chats, the DMs, the phones," Narasimhan said. "But it was all with excitement, not wonderment, like, 'Wow.' It was like, 'Oh my God, let's go,' This is just the opportunity of a lifetime, as far as I'm concerned, for us to show our muscles."


The enthusiasm cuts across the political spectrum. Priti Pandya-Patel, co-founder of the New Jersey Republican Party's South Asia Coalition, said the community is buzzing about the prospect of Usha Vance becoming the country's first Indian American second lady.




"I think it's just a proud moment to see our community actually being out there and being noticed," Pandya-Patel said. "I think that is definitely getting our Indian community very excited."


5 million in US


Indian Americans are one of the fastest-growing immigrant communities, surging more than tenfold since the early 1990s.


Today, there are roughly 5 million people of Indian descent living in the United States, making them the largest Asian ethnic group and the second-largest immigrant group after Mexicans.


While Indian Americans vote Democratic more than any other Asian group, roughly 20% identify as Republican.


The Indian American community has traditionally been perceived as politically less active than some other ethnic groups. However, there are indications of growing political engagement within the community.


A recent survey of Asian Americans, including those of Indian descent, found that 90% intended to vote in the November election even though 42% had not been contacted by either party or candidate.


The Asian American Voter Survey, of nearly 2,500 voters, was conducted between April 4 to May 26 by several Asian American groups.


"So that suggests a potential gap in engagement," said Suhag Shukla, co-founder and executive director of the non-partisan Hindu American Foundation.


Shukla said the election presents a "tremendous opportunity" for the Indian American community as well as the two major political parties.


"I think Indian Americans need to recognize their power, especially because many of us do live in either purple states or purple districts," Shukla said in an interview with VOA, referring to battleground states in the U.S. presidential election. "On the flip side, I think that it's a real opportunity for the parties to do not just a checkmark or a checkbox-type outreach, but genuine outreach. Have town halls. Have listening sessions."


Spokespeople for the Harris and Trump campaigns did not respond to questions about their community outreach efforts.


Both campaigns mobilize voters through grassroots organizations.


Deepa Sharma, deputy director of South Asians for Harris and a delegate to next month's Democratic National Convention, said her group is "working closely with people on the ground who will knock on doors, will do phone bank and outreach to this community."


Indian Americans comprise less than 1% of U.S. registered voters, according to a 2020 study by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. But almost one-third live in closely contested battleground states such as Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.


That puts them in a position to sway the outcome of the November election, said Chintan Patel, executive director of Indian American Impact, a progressive group.


"The South Asian American population far exceeds the margin of victory in the closest elections in these states," Patel said.


Voter turnout steadily climbing


In 2020, the Biden-Harris ticket carried more than 70% of the Indian American vote, according to Patel, adding that support for Harris is likely to edge higher this year.


"She has drawn considerable support from the South Asian American community because she has consistently shown up and fought for our values, fought for our issues," Patel said.


Earlier this year, Harris spoke at Indian American Impact's "Desis Decide" summit, where she credited Indian Americans and Asian Americans with helping to get two Democratic senators elected in 2020 and 2021.


Patel said voter turnout among South Asian Americans has been steadily climbing in recent years. In 2020, for example, more than 70% of registered South Asian American voters turned out to vote in Pennsylvania, he said.


"I think they're going to be instrumental in delivering the White House this November," Patel said.


Similar predictions by groups such as Muslim Americans have sometimes failed to materialize.


But Narasimhan said turnout could be boosted with the right voter mobilization strategy, adding that voter education is key.


"Just because you're a citizen doesn't mean you can vote, you have to register," Narasimhan said. "Teaching people the basic rudimentaries of what's early voting, what's absentee balloting, what's going to the polls, navigating the system is critical, and we have to do that basic education."


On the Republican side, activists are betting that Trump's close ties to India's Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi will translate into votes for the former president.




"Trump has been friendly to India and that makes a big difference," Pandya-Patel, the Republican activist in New Jersey, said.


Whether Indian American support for Trump is rising remains unclear.


In the recent Asian American Voter Survey, 29% of Indian Americans said they intended to vote for Trump, largely unchanged from four years ago.


Trump has called Modi a "true friend." In 2019, he and Modi addressed a joint rally in Houston, Texas, that attracted more than 50,000 people, many supporters of the Indian prime minister. At the "Howdy, Modi!" rally, Trump called Modi "one of America's greatest, most devoted and most loyal friends."


Pandya-Patel said the rally boosted Indian American support for Trump, whose friendship with Modi, she added, is a key reason many Indian Americans back him.


Shukla of the Hindu American Foundation said there is a perception among some Indian Americans that the Democratic Party is not "a Hindu-friendly party."


That may partly explain a recent "shift" in Indian American party affiliation, she said.


In the Asian American Voter Survey, the number of Indians who identify as Democrats fell from 54% in 2020 to 47% in 2024, while those identifying with the Republican Party rose from 16% to 21%.


Anang Mittal, a Virginia-based commentator who previously worked for House Speaker Mike Johnson, said the apparent shift reflects less a "sea change" than shifting political attitudes.


"I think the country as a whole is sort of shifting towards Republicans because of the larger issues that are plaguing this election," Mittal said.

## Netanyahu’s speech to Congress seen as unlikely to shift US policy on Israel-Hamas war

date: 2024-07-26, from: VOA News USA

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech on Wednesday to Congress highlighted US partisan divisions on his conduct of the war against the Hamas terror group, and some of his differences with President Joe Biden on how best to secure Israel’s future. VOA’s Michael Lipin looks at how Netanyahu’s address and Biden’s decision last weekend not to run for reelection may affect US policy on the Israel-Hamas war in the coming months.

## White House backs phased-in cease-fire in Gaza

date: 2024-07-26, from: VOA News USA

White House — The Biden administration is hopeful over a deal to reach a cease-fire and free hostages held in Gaza, where war has raged for more than nine months after Hamas’ stunning October 7 attack on Israel.


VOA spoke to John Kirby, White House national security spokesperson, about the deal and more, in this interview with VOA's White House Correspondent Begum Ersoz on Thursday.


The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.


VOA: Does the administration accept a cease-fire deal only with phase one, that does not guarantee any way forward for the other phases of the deal? What stands in the way of a deal? And what are the sticking points?


KIRBY: The whole purpose of the proposal is that you get to phase one, you get a six-week ceasefire, get some hostages out and you begin the negotiations on phase two. That’s the whole purpose of this proposal. What we want to do is to get to phase one, get the six weeks started. …I will not get into the details and negotiate in public. But we believe the gaps are narrow enough, that with compromise and leadership on both sides could be closed.


VOA: Is the administration concerned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might be using this visit to the U.S. to bolster his own domestic political standing?


KIRBY: I think it's important that the American people had a chance to hear directly from the prime minister with comments [before the U.S. Congress] on Capitol Hill. And we obviously look forward to any opportunity we have, including the one today, to sit down and discuss these issues in a private setting. We also believe it was important that the prime minister hear directly from the families of the American hostages and understand their anxiety, their fear, their desire to get their loved ones home. I won’t speak for the domestic considerations of the prime minister, that’s for him to speak to, but it's pretty clear that the Israeli people also want to see those hostages returned. They want their loved ones back too.


VOA: Netanyahu also had talks with Vice President Kamala Harris. As the presumptive nominee for the Democratic party, to what extent she will follow the same trajectory as the Biden administration?


KIRBY: I'm not going to speculate about the future. Those are the questions for the vice president. Because what I can tell you, without question, is that she has been a full partner in the pursuit of the policies that this administration has made clear are important to us with respect to the Middle East and the war in Gaza. She has been a full partner and had conversations with Israeli counterparts on her own. She's been involved in virtually every conversation that the president has had with the prime minister.


VOA: Some NATO officials express concerns about an arms race with the axis of Russia-China-Iran-North Korea – and some say it has already helped Russia reconstitute its forces and capabilities more quickly. How potent is the Russian-Chinese-Iranian-North Korean axis? And do you see their cooperation expanding?


KIRBY: We have certainly watched with concern the burgeoning defense relationships between Russia and China and between Russia and North Korea. The way that it's manifested itself, particularly in Ukraine – Chinese companies now providing components for some Russian systems North Koreans providing artillery shells and ballistic missiles. Obviously, that's of concern to us. And we have and will continue to take the appropriate action to make sure these countries are held accountable for what they're doing in terms of supporting the war in Ukraine.


VOA: The Taliban claim Afghanistan is a victim of the destructive activities of groups with operations in neighboring countries and in the region. They warn that if the world neglects this, it could face a dangerous outcome. Does the U.S. perceive or sense any potential threat from Afghanistan?


KIRBY: First of all, we don't recognize the Taliban as the governing authority of Afghanistan. They made some commitments when they took over Kabul. They have not met those commitments. If they want legitimacy on the world stage, if they want to be taken seriously, they need to start making good on some of those commitments. They do have internal security issues, particularly an ongoing terrorist threat inside Afghanistan. And that is something that they're going to have to reconcile with. But the idea of playing victim here after they forcibly took over governance in Afghanistan rings pretty hollow to the international community.


VOA: During the NATO summit, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that the approach of Western allies fuel the fire in the war in Ukraine instead of bringing about peace. Any reaction to that?


KIRBY: All I can tell you is that everything that President Biden has been doing since the beginning of this illegal aggression by Russia and unprovoked war has been to put Mr. Zelenskyy and Ukrainians in the best position possible, a position of strength, so that if and when they're ready to negotiate an end to this war, they can do it, knowing they've been supported by the United States and the international community. We all want to see this war end. And it's worth reminding people that the war could end tomorrow if Putin did the right thing and got his troops the hell out of Ukraine. So we make no apologies, none, whatsoever about what we're trying to do to make sure that Ukraine can find a way to end this war on terms that are acceptable to them.

## Washington warns adversaries: US politics not a sign of weakness

date: 2024-07-25, from: VOA News USA

washington  — U.S. diplomats and military officials rejected concerns that recent — and sudden — changes to the American political landscape are a sign of weakness, warning America’s adversaries Thursday against trying to seek any sort of advantage.


“They should think again,” said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller, briefing reporters.


“They should be disabused of the notion that we are anything but focused on the national security challenges that the country faces,” he added. “That includes responding to our adversaries when appropriate.”


At the Pentagon, officials insisted that whatever challenges U.S. adversaries might have in store, the U.S. military is ready.


“As to whether or not our adversaries are testing us at this particular time, they're always testing us,” said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.


“It's just a nature of who they are and what they do,” he told reporters. “I don’t think that this particular point in time is any different.”


The warnings from Washington come less than a week after U.S. President Joe Biden announced he would no longer seek reelection, instead endorsing fellow Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris to run against former president and Republican Party nominee Donald Trump.


In an address from the White House late Wednesday to explain his decision to quit the race with just more than 100 days to go until the presidential election, Biden spoke in stark terms about the future of the country.


“Nothing — nothing — can come in the way of saving our democracy,” Biden said.


“America is going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division,” he added. “We have to decide: Do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy?”




Adding to the public concerns, the U.S. military announced just before Biden’s speech that, for the first time, Russian and Chinese long-range strategic bombers flew a joint training mission, coming within 350 kilometers of the northwestern U.S. state of Alaska.




Other officials have also warned of emboldened U.S. adversaries.


FBI Director Christopher Wray on Wednesday told lawmakers that Iran still seeks retribution against Trump and some of his advisers for the January 2020 killing of former Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani.


"We need to recognize the brazenness of the Iranian regime, including right here in the United States," he said, while declining to share details of a reported assassination plot against Trump.


“I expect there will be more coming on that," he said.




Others have voiced concerns about the actions of Iranian proxy forces, like the ongoing attacks by Yemen’s Houthis on international shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, or attacks by Iranian-backed militias on U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria.




“We are taking away capability from the Houthis,” said the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General CQ Brown Jr., speaking to reporters Thursday at a Pentagon briefing.


“But at the same point, it's going to take more than just a military operation,” he said. “This is an engagement with the international community, but also the [U.S.] interagency to use the various tools to put pressure on the Houthis to cease this.”


At the State Department, spokesperson Miller said no matter the challenge, U.S diplomats will be up to the task.


“The president has made it incredibly clear to the secretary and the rest of the national security team that he expects them to be focused for this next six months, that he expects them to advance the foreign policy objectives that he laid out from the outset of the administration and we have put into place over the course of the last three and a half years,” he said.


And should any adversary seek to weaken the U.S., the Pentagon’s Austin said, the military will be waiting.


“I think we'll continue to see this going forward,” he told reporters. “But again, we have the world's greatest military, most capable military, and we will continue to protect this nation.”

## OpenAI beta tests SearchGPT search engine

date: 2024-07-25, from: OS News

Normally I&#8217;m not that interested in reporting on news coming from OpenAI, but today is a little different &#8211; the company launched SearchGPT, a search engine that&#8217;s supposed to rival Google, but at the same time, they&#8217;re also kind of not launching a search engine that&#8217;s supposed to rival Google. What? We’re testing SearchGPT, a prototype of new search features designed to combine the strength of our AI models with information from the web to give you fast and timely answers with clear and relevant sources. We’re launching to a small group of users and publishers to get feedback. While this prototype is temporary, we plan to integrate the best of these features directly into ChatGPT in the future. If you’re interested in trying the prototype, sign up for the waitlist. ↫ OpenAI website Basically, before adding a more traditional web-search like feature set to ChatGPT, the company is first breaking them out into a separate, temporary product that users can test, before parts of it will be integrated into OpenAI&#8217;s main ChatGPT product. It&#8217;s an interesting approach, and with just how stupidly popular and hyped ChatGPT is, I&#8217;m sure they won&#8217;t have any issues assembling a large enough pool of testers. OpenAI claims SearchGPT will be different from, say, Google or AltaVista, by employing a conversation-style interface with real-time results from the web. Sources for search results will be clearly marked &#8211; good &#8211; and additional sources will be presented in a sidebar. True to the ChatGPT-style user interface, you can keep &#8220;talking&#8221; after hitting a result to refine your search further. I may perhaps betray my still relatively modest age, but do people really want to &#8220;talk&#8221; to a machine to search the web? Any time I&#8217;ve ever used one of these chatbot-style user interfaces -including ChatGPT &#8211; I find them cumbersome and frustrating, like they&#8217;re just adding an obtuse layer between me and the computer, and that I&#8217;d rather just be instructing the computer directly. Why try and verbally massage a stupid autocomplete into finding a link to an article I remember from a few days ago, instead of just typing in a few quick keywords? I am more than willing to concede I&#8217;m just out of touch with what people really want, so maybe this really is the future of search.

## Two threads, one core: how simultaneous multithreading works under the hood

date: 2024-07-25, from: OS News

Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) is a feature that lets a processor handle instructions from two different threads at the same time. But have you ever wondered how this actually works? How does the processor keep track of two threads and manage its resources between them? In this article, we’re going to break it all down. Understanding the nuts and bolts of SMT will help you decide if it’s a good fit for your production servers. Sometimes, SMT can turbocharge your system&#8217;s performance, but in other cases, it might actually slow things down. Knowing the details will help you make the best choice. ↫ Abhinav Upadhyay Some light reading for the (almost) weekend.

## US, Taiwan, China race to improve military drone technology

date: 2024-07-25, from: VOA News USA

washington — This week, as Taiwan was preparing for the start of its Han Kuang military exercises, its air defense system detected a Chinese drone circling the island. This was the sixth time that China had sent a drone to operate around Taiwan since 2023.


Drones like the one that flew around Taiwan, which are tasked with dual-pronged missions of reconnaissance and intimidation, are just a small part of a broader trend that is making headlines from Ukraine to the Middle East to the Taiwan Strait and is changing the face of warfare. 


The increasing role that unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, play and rising concern about a Chinese invasion of democratically ruled Taiwan is pushing Washington, Beijing and Taipei to improve the sophistication, adaptability and cost of drone technology.


'Hellscape' strategy


Last August, the Pentagon launched a $1 billion Replicator Initiative to create air, sea and land drones in the "multiple thousands," according to the Defense Department's Innovation Unit. The Pentagon aims to build that force of drones by August 2025.


The initiative is part of what U.S. Admiral Samuel Paparo recently described to The Washington Post as a "hellscape" strategy, which aims to counter a Chinese invasion of Taiwan through the deployment of thousands of unmanned drones in the air and sea between the island and China.


"The benefits of unmanned systems are that you get cheap, disposable mass that's low cost. If a drone gets shot down, the only people that are crying about it are the accountants," said Zachary Kallenborn, a policy fellow at George Mason University. "You can use them at large amounts of scale and overwhelm your opponents as well as degrade their defensive capabilities."


The hellscape strategy, he added, aims to use lots of cheap drones to try to hold back China from attacking Taiwan.


Drone manufacturing supremacy


China has its own plans under way and is the world's largest manufacturer of commercial drones. In a news briefing after Paparo's remarks to the Post, it warned Washington that it was playing with fire. 


"Those who clamor for turning others' homeland into hell should get ready for burning in hell themselves," said Senior Colonel Wu Qian, spokesperson for the Chinese defense ministry.


"The People's Liberation Army is able to fight and win in thwarting external interference and safeguarding our national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Threats and intimidation never work on us," Wu said.




China's effort to expand its use of drones has been bolstered, analysts say, by leader Xi Jinping's emphasis on technology and modernization in the military, something he highlighted at a top-level party meeting last week.


"China's military is developing more than 50 types of drones with varying capabilities, amassing a fleet of tens of thousands of drones, potentially 10 times larger than Taiwan and the U.S. combined," Michael Raska, assistant professor at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, told VOA in an email. "This quantitative edge currently fuels China's accelerating military modernization, with drones envisioned for everything from pre-conflict intel gathering to swarming attacks."


Analysts add that China's commercial drone manufacturing supremacy aids its military in the push for drone development. China's DJI dominates in production and sale of household drones, accounting for 76% of the worldwide consumer market in 2021.


The scale of production and low price of DJI drones could put China in an advantageous position in a potential drone war, analysts say.


"In Russia and Ukraine, if you have a lot of drones – even if they're like the commercial off-the-shelf things, DJI drones you can buy at Costco – and you throw hundreds of them at an air defense system, that's going to create a large problem," said Major Emilie Stewart, a research analyst at the China Aerospace Studies Institute.


China denies it is seeking to use commercial UAV technology for future conflicts.


"China has always been committed to maintaining global security and regional stability and has always opposed the use of civilian drones for military purposes," Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA. "We are firmly opposed to the U.S.'s military ties with Taiwan and its effort of arming Taiwan."


Drone force


With assistance from its American partners, pressure from China and lessons from Ukraine, Taiwan has been pushing to develop its own domestic drone warfare capabilities.




The United States has played a pivotal role in Taiwan's drone development, and just last week it pledged to sell $360 million of attack drones to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office, or TECRO, Taiwan's de facto embassy in Washington.


"Taiwan will continue to build a credible deterrence and work closely with like-minded partners, including the United States, to preserve peace and stability in the region," TECRO told VOA when asked about the collaboration between Taipei and Washington. "We have no further information to share at this moment."


The effort to incorporate drones into its defense is crucial for Taiwan, said Eric Chan, a senior nonresident fellow at the Global Taiwan Institute.


"The biggest immediate effects of the U.S. coming into this mass UAV game is to give Taiwan a bigger advantage to be able to, first, detect their enemy and, second, help them build a backstop to their own capabilities as well," Chan said.


With the potential for China to consider using drones in an urban conflict environment, Taiwan is recognizing the importance of stepping up its counter-drone defense systems.


"After multiple intrusions of Chinese drones in outlying islands, the Taiwan Ministry of Defense now places great emphasis on anti-drone capabilities," said Yu-Jiu Wang, chief executive of Tron Future, an anti-drone company working with the Taiwanese military.


The demand is one that Wang said his company is willing and ready to fill.

## Climate Tech Investors Aren’t Too Worried About Trump

date: 2024-07-25, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mjk3NDMwMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4MjQ0NzYzMn0.3Bpd03bA-URrDuJWcUFahq2nBATOaA_SjrS0uu6BnzE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Plenty has <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/joe-biden-dropping-out-legacy" target="_self"><u>changed</u></a> in the <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/kamala-harris-climate-record" target="_self"><u>race</u></a> for the U.S. presidency over the past week. One thing that hasn’t: Gobs of public and private funding for climate tech are still on the line. If Republicans regain the White House and Senate, tax credits and other programs in the Inflation Reduction Act will become an easy target for legislators looking to burnish their cost-cutting (and lib-owning) reputations. The effects of key provisions getting either completely tossed or seriously amended would assuredly ripple out to the private sector. </p><p>You would think the possible impending loss of a huge source of funding for clean technologies would make venture capitalists worry about the future of their business model. And indeed, they are worried — at least in theory. None of the clean tech investors I’ve spoken with over the past few weeks told me that a Republican administration would affect the way <em><em>their</em></em> firm invests — not Lowercarbon Capital, not Breakthrough Energy Ventures, not Khosla Ventures, or any of the VCs with uplifting verbs: Galvanize Climate Solutions, Generate Capital, and Energize Capital. </p><p>Numerous investors did say, however, that they thought a Republican-controlled White House and perhaps Congress would affect the investment landscape overall. “The real answer is, it will impact,” Rajesh Swaminathan, a partner at Khosla Ventures, told me. “I don’t expect everybody that came in when the going was great to remain when and if the going gets tough with any kind of administration shift,” Juan Muldoon, a partner at the climate software VC Energize Capital, told me. </p><p>A Trump presidency puts $1 trillion in overall energy investments at risk, according to <a href="https://www.woodmac.com/press-releases/2024-press-releases/us-november-election-results-could-decelerate-energy-transition-with-%241-trillion-in-energy-investment-on-the-line/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a May report</u></a> from energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Much of this depends on whether Trump would take a scalpel or a hammer to IRA incentives, which is difficult to predict. Republican rhetoric is often extreme — <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ed4b352b-5c06-4f8d-9df7-1b1f9fecb269" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gut the IRA</u></a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/09/trump-epa-plan-environment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gut the Environmental Protection Agency</u></a>, maximize fossil fuel production. If actions align with words, climate tech investors ought to have plenty of reasons to be fearful, as the startups they support often owe part of their success to government grants and incentives. </p><p>As it stands, there’s widespread agreement that mature technologies like solar and wind will survive and potentially even thrive no matter the changing political tides. But tech that’s yet to come down the cost curve could surely see less investment. This includes electric vehicles, which Trump has alternately <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/trump-desantis-elon-musk-evs" target="_self"><u>derided</u></a> and <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-ev-pivot-elon-musk" target="_self"><u>praised</u></a>, though this isn’t really the domain of VCs. Newer technologies that benefit from the <a href="https://rhg.com/research/tech-neutral-tax-credits-electric-power/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tech-neutral</u></a> clean electricity investment and production tax credits could be at risk, especially energy storage in any form, as <a href="https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/H.R.-3938-Bill-Text.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the GOP has already introduced a bill</u></a> that would eliminate these credits. Tech for hard-to-decarbonize industrial sectors such as steel, cement and chemicals production could also take a hit, as emergent solutions are often simply much pricier than business-as-usual. </p><p>Some cleantech does benefit from bipartisan support. This includes nuclear — both fission and fusion — as well as technologies that stand to enrich the oil and gas industry, such as <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/geothermal-energy-bill-new-mexico" target="_self"><u>advanced geothermal</u></a> and <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/news/featured-story/potential-geologic-hydrogen-next-generation-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>geologic hydrogen</u></a>, both of which require drilling expertise. And considering the largest direct air capture deal to date is Occidental Petroleum’s <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/occidentals-big-buy-may-change-course-of-150-billion-market/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$1.1 billion acquisition</u></a> of Carbon Engineering, DAC, as well as point source carbon capture and storage, could also grow under Trump, as <a href="https://www.api.org/news-policy-and-issues/carbon-capture-storage" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the oil and gas industry</u></a> essentially views CCS as a pathway towards the continued production of fossil fuels. </p><p>The rest of the hydrogen industry is a jump ball. Green hydrogen made from renewable-powered electrolyzers is expensive and the <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>proposed strict rules</u></a> that would allow it to qualify for the most generous tax credit are <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/hydrogen-tax-credit-rules" target="_self"><u>likely goners</u></a>. But a fossil-fuel based hydrogen economy is certainly an option — although not one that will <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-treasury" target="_self"><u>do much for the climate</u></a>. </p><p>Essentially, though, a number of investors and policy wonks told me that they simply don’t expect the GOP’s bark to match its bite when it comes to completely repealing or seriously altering many of the IRA’s key provisions, instead trusting that legislators will recognize the law’s economic benefits, even if they’re not advertising them.</p><p>Although the first Trump administration was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks-list.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>undoubtedly disastrous</u></a> for climate policy, it’s true that many of Trump’s more extreme ambitions never materialized. His <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/budget-fy2020.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>budget proposals</u></a> regularly recommended major funding cuts to the EPA as well as the Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and called for eliminating key DOE agencies like the Loan Programs Office and the energy tech-focused ARPA-E. But Congress ultimately rejected all these proposals. Funding for both <a href="https://www.epa.gov/planandbudget/budget" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the EPA</u></a> and <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/explorer/agency" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>EERE</u></a><a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/agency/department-of-energy?fy=2017" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u> </u></a>trended upwards, as did funding for clean energy research and development more broadly. </p><p>But the IRA didn’t exist then, and now that it does, the bill has become a major recipient of Republican ire. “Precedent tells you it might not be as drastic as you think,” Ben Brenner, senior vice president at the climate-focused government affairs and advisory firm Boundary Stone Partners, told me. “But the environment is very target rich now.”</p><p>Brenner noted that the 45X advanced manufacturing production tax credit, for instance, has helped incentivize <a href="https://us.qcells.com/blog/qcells-north-america-completes-dalton-factory-expansion/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the expansion</u></a> of the largest solar manufacturing facility in the U.S. in Dalton, Georgia, Representative Marjorie Taylor-Greene’s territory. Were Republicans to bring it up for full or partial repeal, Brenner thinks results would fall along partisan lines. “If we’re banking on the fact that Marjorie Taylor Greene is going to vote with Democrats on this, we’re fooling ourselves, right? That is not a real viable political strategy.” </p><p>In the end, elected officials are responsible to voters. You might think that, because IRA benefits are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-opinion-biden-ira-sends-green-energy-investment-republican-districts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>largely flowing to red states</u></a>, that will lead to a groundswell of citizen support, but Brenner told me that’s a risky assumption to make. “Wow, it would be nice to think, in theory, that people respond to political incentives in that way,” he said. But “there’s a plenty broad and big enough body of data to show that isn’t necessarily how people react politically.”</p><p>That matters for venture capitalists, because while they might view themselves as insulated from the whims of government, <a href="https://impactalpha.com/venture-capital-investors-in-climate-tech-are-closer-to-government-than-they-might-want-to-admit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a 2023 analysis</u></a> by ImpactAlpha shows how interconnected the ecosystems are. The analysis, which <a href="https://co-investors.climatefinancetracker.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>groups climate tech investors</u></a> into clusters based on who they frequently co-invest with, found that two of the most central climate “investors” in the network are the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy, which provide grants to climate-focused startups. It also showed that government grants markedly increase a startup’s chance of survival and ability to raise additional capital in early funding rounds.</p><p>If government can’t be a reliable partner to private industry, Aliya Haq, vice president of U.S. policy and advocacy at Breakthrough Energy, told me, “the private sector can’t move forward. Companies can’t figure out what facilities they can build, investors don’t know what actually makes sense to put money into.” (Breakthrough Energy is the umbrella organization for the climate tech VC firm Breakthrough Energy Ventures.) </p><p>On an individual level, though, many investors beg to differ, saying that as accelerative as government support can be, they invest in companies that can weather the inevitable vagaries of politics. “The most important climate investing is investing in assets that are long lived, and those things have to be durable across administrations,” Jonah Goldman, head of external affairs and impact at the sustainable infrastructure investment firm Generate Capital, told me.</p><p>That was a common refrain. “We’ve invested under a Republican president, a Democratic president,”<em> </em>Muldoon told me. “When we talk about a transition, it needs to span changes in political regimes.” </p><p>Clay Dumas, a founding partner at Lowercarbon Capital who used to work in the Obama White House, agreed. “If you were depending on a big premium to sell your products at scale, you were in trouble before the IRA, and you’re going to be in trouble no matter who is president next year,” he told me. </p><p>At the same time, there’s no denying that investment is down. <a href="https://www.ctvc.co/a-weak-11-3bn-start-to-2024-climate-tech/?ref=ctvc-by-sightline-climate-newsletter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>A recent report</u></a> from the market intelligence firm Sightline Climate indicated that climate tech funding in the first half of 2024 fell to 2020 levels, which aligns with a downturn in the <a href="https://dealroom.co/guides/global" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>VC market at large</u></a>. The assumption is that it’s at least partially due to investors taking a “wait-and-see” approach ahead of November, although other factors such as high interest rates and continued inflation could also be playing a role. The landscape has been especially tough for startups that have already raised a few rounds, as it now takes about 2.5 times longer to raise a Series B as it did in 2021, when the climate tech market was white hot. </p><p>“Those emerging technologies absolutely need government partnership to be able to get across the Valley of Death, to be able to scale, to be able to compete on a level playing field with fossil fuels,” Haq told me.<em> </em></p><p>Even if government does pull way back, Muldoon told me that other sources of funding could step in — universities, private research organizations, family offices and other forms of philanthropic dollars might turn to support climate tech. Still though, he admits that “it doesn’t necessarily fill the void.”</p><p>But Haq and many of the investors I spoke with are hanging onto the belief that there won’t necessarily be a void to fill — that the benefits of government investment in climate tech will prevail in the face of deep partisan divides, giving private investors the confidence they need to keep the money coming.</p><p>“I hold out hope that there’s enough rationality still left in politics, despite the messaging but in the reality of policymaking, that it doesn’t matter what color your shirt is,” Haq told me. “What matters is whether or not there are jobs in your district, whether there is strong U.S. competitiveness, whether the communities in your state have a strong tax base.”</p><p>Fingers crossed. </p>

## Video game performers to strike over artificial intelligence concerns

date: 2024-07-25, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — Hollywood's video game performers voted Thursday to go on strike, throwing part of the entertainment industry into another work stoppage after talks for a new contract with major game studios broke down over artificial intelligence protections. 


The strike — the second for video game voice actors and motion capture performers under the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists — will begin at 12:01 a.m. Friday. The move comes after nearly two years of negotiations with gaming giants, including divisions of Activision, Warner Bros. and Walt Disney Co., over a new interactive media agreement. 


SAG-AFTRA negotiators say gains have been made over wages and job safety in the video game contract, but that the studios will not make a deal over the regulation of generative AI. Without guardrails, game companies could train AI to replicate an actor's voice, or create a digital replica of their likeness without consent or fair compensation, the union said. 


Fran Drescher, the union's president, said in a prepared statement that members would not approve a contract that would allow companies to "abuse AI." 


"Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live — and work — with, we will be here, ready to negotiate," Drescher said. 




A representative for the studios did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. 


The global video game industry generates well over $100 billion in profit annually, according to game market forecaster Newzoo. The people who design and bring those games to life are the driving force behind that success, SAG-AFTRA said. 


"Eighteen months of negotiations have shown us that our employers are not interested in fair, reasonable AI protections, but rather flagrant exploitation," said Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee Chair Sarah Elmaleh. 


Last month, union negotiators told The Associated Press that the game studios refused to "provide an equal level of protection from the dangers of AI for all our members" — specifically, movement performers. 


Members voted overwhelmingly last year to give leadership the authority to strike. Concerns about how movie studios will use AI helped fuel last year's film and television strikes by the union, which lasted four months. 


The last interactive contract, which expired November 2022, did not provide protections around AI but secured a bonus compensation structure for voice actors and performance capture artists after an 11-month strike that began October 2016. That work stoppage marked the first major labor action from SAG-AFTRA following the merger of Hollywood's two largest actors unions in 2012. 


The video game agreement covers more than 2,500 "off-camera (voiceover) performers, on-camera (motion capture, stunt) performers, stunt coordinators, singers, dancers, puppeteers, and background performers," according to the union. 


Amid the tense interactive negotiations, SAG-AFTRA created a separate contract in February that covered indie and lower-budget video game projects. The tiered-budget independent interactive media agreement contains some of the protections on AI that video game industry titans have rejected.

## Intel: Raptor Lake faults excessive voltage from microcode, fix coming in August

date: 2024-07-25, from: OS News

In what started last year as a handful of reports about instability with Intel&#8217;s Raptor Lake desktop chips has, over the last several months, grown into a much larger saga. Facing their biggest client chip instability impediment in decades, Intel has been under increasing pressure to figure out the root cause of the issue and fix it, as claims of damaged chips have stacked up and rumors have swirled amidst the silence from Intel. But, at long last, it looks like Intel&#8217;s latest saga is about to reach its end, as today the company has announced that they&#8217;ve found the cause of the issue, and will be rolling out a microcode fix next month to resolve it. ↫ Ryan Smith at AnandTech It turns out the root cause of the problem is &#8220;elevated operating voltages&#8221;, caused by a buggy algorithm in Intel&#8217;s own microcode. As such, it&#8217;s at least fixable through a microcode update, which Intel says it will ship sometime mid-August. AnandTech, my one true source for proper reporting on things like this, is not entirely satisfied, though, as they state microcode is often used to just cover up the real root cause that&#8217;s located much deeper inside the processor, and as such, Intel&#8217;s explanation doesn&#8217;t actually tell us very much at all. Quite coincidentally, Intel also experienced a manufacturing flaw with a small batch of very early Raptor Lake processors. An &#8220;oxidation manufacturing flaw&#8221; found its way into a small number of early Raptor Lake processors, but the company claims it was caught early and shouldn&#8217;t be an issue any more. Of course, for anyone experiencing issues with their expensive Intel processors, this will linger in the back of their minds, too. Not exactly a flawless launch for Intel, but it seems its main only competitor, AMD, is also experiencing issues, as the company has delayed the launch of its new Ryzen 9000 chips due to quality issues. I&#8217;m not at all qualified to make any relevant statements about this, but with the recent launch of the Snapdragon Elite X and Pro chips, these issues couldn&#8217;t come at a worse time for Intel and AMD.

## California governor issues executive order for removal of homeless encampments

date: 2024-07-25, from: VOA News USA

Sacramento, California — California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order Thursday to direct state agencies on how to remove homeless encampments, a month after a Supreme Court ruling allowing cities to enforce bans on sleeping outside in public spaces.


Newsom's order is aimed at the thousands of tents and makeshift shelters across the state that line freeways, clutter shopping center parking lots and fill city parks. The order makes clear that the decision to remove the encampments remains in local hands.


The order comes after a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this summer allowing cities to enforce bans on sleeping outside in public spaces. The case was the most significant on the issue to come before the high court in decades and comes as cities across the country have wrestled with the politically complicated issue of how to deal with a rising number of people without a permanent place to live and public frustration over related health and safety issues.


Newsom's administration wrote in support of cities' argument that previous rulings, including one that barred San Francisco from clearing encampments until more shelter beds were available, have prevented the state from solving a critical problem.


"There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part," Newsom said in a statement.


While Newsom cannot order local authorities to act, his administration can apply pressure by withholding money for counties and cities.


California is home to roughly one-third of the nation's population of homeless people, a problem that has dogged Newsom since he took office. Newsom touted that his administration has spent roughly $24 billion aimed at cleaning up streets and housing people but acknowledged the stubbornness of the issue. Newsom's administration has also come under fire recently after a state audit found that the state didn't consistently track whether the huge outlay of public money actually improved the situation.


Newsom has worked hard to address the issue. He threw all of his political weight behind a ballot measure earlier this year to allow the state to borrow nearly $6.4 billion to build 4,350 housing units, which passed with a razor-thin margin.


The order comes as Republicans have stepped up their criticisms of California and its homelessness crisis as Vice President Kamala Harris — a former California district attorney, attorney general and senator — launches her presidential campaign. Harris entered the race over the weekend after President Joe Biden's announced that he would not seek reelection. Newsom himself has presidential ambitions.


The timing of the executive order is "curious," said California political analyst Brian Sobel, but he doubts Newsom's move would have much impact on Harris' campaign.


"Harris' problem isn't in California, because California is a done deal," he said. "Where she needs to do well on issues like this are in swing states."


Rather, the order is a logical step for Newsom, who called himself the state's "homeless czar" and made homelessness a signature policy issue the last few years, said Wesley Hussey, a political science professor at California State University, Sacramento.

 

"I don't think it's being motivated by the presidential race as much as it's definitely something that Newsom cared a lot about," Hussey said. "If you're going to put it in a political context of the election, this isn't going to magically fix the problem."


Newsom's decision have garnered praises from local elected officials and business groups, who said they were left with no options to address homeless encampments before the Supreme Court's ruling. San Francisco Mayor London Breed recently said the city will start an "aggressive" campaign to clear encampments across the city in August. Her office noted that the governor's order does not affect the city's operations.


"I applaud Governor Newsom's emphasis on urgency," Kathryn Barger, a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors said in a statement. "He rightfully points out that local government remains at the helm of homeless encampment removals. Cities have an obligation to develop housing and shelter solutions in tandem with support services provided by County government."


Homeless people and their advocates say the sweeps are cruel and a waste of taxpayer money. They say the answer is more housing, not crackdowns.


Under Newsom's direction, state agencies — including state parks and the Department of Transportation — would be required to prioritize clearing encampments that pose safety risks, such as those camping along waterways. Officials should give advance notice to vacate, connect homeless people to local services and help store their belongings for at least 60 days. Local cities and counties are urged to adopt similar protocols.

## US official unfazed by Russian-Chinese flyby off coast of Alaska

date: 2024-07-25, from: VOA News USA

washington — The appearance of two Russian and two Chinese long-range, strategic bombers in the skies off of coastal Alaska may have been a first, but it did not catch the United States off-guard.


U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters Thursday the appearance of the Russian and Chinese aircraft "was not a surprise" and that at no time did the bombers pose a threat to the United States.


"We have very good surveillance capabilities," Austin said during a rare news conference at the Pentagon. "We closely monitored these aircraft, tracked the aircraft, intercepted the aircraft, which demonstrates that our forces are at the ready all the time." 


And if Russia and China fly more similar missions in the future, Austin said he has every confidence that U.S. forces will be prepared.


"We are at the ready. We will always be at the ready," he said. "If there is a challenge or a threat to the United States of America, your troops will be at the ready and they will do the right thing."


NORAD tracks aircraft


The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) first shared word of the Russian and Chinese military activity late Wednesday.


NORAD said it tracked two Russian TU-95 bombers and two Chinese H-6 bombers operating in the U.S. Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) — a stretch of international airspace where planes must be identified — off the coast of the northwestern state of Alaska.


A statement said U.S. and Canadian fighter jets were sent to intercept the Russian and Chinese planes, and that at no time did the Russian or Chinese pilots enter U.S. or Canadian sovereign airspace.


"This Russian and PRC activity in the Alaska ADIZ is not seen as a threat, and NORAD will continue to monitor competitor activity near North America and meet presence with presence," it said.


Flight was joint patrol, say Russia and China


Russia and China on Thursday described the flight as a joint patrol over the Chukchi and Bering seas in the north Pacific.


"During the flight, Russian and Chinese crews cooperated in the new area of joint operations during all stages of the air patrol," the Russian ministry said in a statement, describing the exercise as "part of the implementation of the military cooperation plan for 2024."


Russian officials said the entire flight lasted five hours and that the bombers were at times escorted by Russian fighter jets, emphasizing that at no time did the bombers violate U.S. or Canadian airspace.


A spokesperson for the Chinese military said the patrol was designed to improve coordination between the Chinese and Russian militaries, and said it was the eighth joint air patrol since 2019.


The U.S., however, said the Russian-Chinese air patrol was the first to approach the area around Alaska.


"This is the first time we've seen those two countries fly together like that," Austin told reporters, adding the Russian and Chinese bombers never got closer than about 320 kilometers from the Alaskan coast.


The U.S. defense secretary declined to comment on the timing of the Russian-Chinese air patrol, though he said, "you could probably guess that things like that have probably been planned well in advance."




Earlier this week, the Pentagon issued its new Arctic defense strategy, which called for increased investment and increased cooperation among the U.S. and its Arctic allies to counter both Russian and Chinese activity.


The U.S. and its NATO allies have also raised concerns about growing cooperation between Russia and China, along with Iran and North Korea, as Moscow has sought support for its war in Ukraine.




U.S. and Western officials have repeatedly accused China of playing a critical role in sustaining Russia's military by sending Russia raw materials and so-called dual-use components needed to produce advanced weapons and weapons systems.


"There is no time to lose," a NATO official told VOA earlier this month, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the need to counter the growing defense cooperation.


"This must be a key priority for all our allies, because it is not just about spending more," the official said. "It is also on getting those capabilities."


Information from the Associated Press and Reuters was used in this report.

## North Korean charged in ransomware attacks on US hospitals

date: 2024-07-25, from: VOA News USA

Kansas City, Kansas — A man who officials say worked for one of North Korea's military intelligence agencies has been indicted for his alleged involvement in a conspiracy to hack American health care providers, federal prosecutors announced Thursday.


A grand jury in Kansas City, Kansas, indicted Rim Jong Hyok, who is accused of laundering ransom money and using the money to fund additional cyberattacks on defense, technology and government entities around the world. The hack on American hospitals on other health care providers disrupted the treatment of patients, officials said.


"While North Korea uses these types of cybercrimes to circumvent international sanctions and fund its political and military ambitions, the impact of these wanton acts have a direct impact on the citizens of Kansas," said Stephen A. Cyrus, an FBI agent based in Kansas City.


Online court records do not list an attorney for Hyok.


Justice Department officials said an attack on a Kansas hospital, which they did not identify, happened in May 2021 when hackers encrypted the medical center's files and servers. The hospital paid about $100,000 in Bitcoin to get its data back.


The department said it recovered that ransom as well as a payment from a Colorado health care provider affected by the same Maui ransomware variant.


The Justice Department has brought multiple criminal cases related to North Korean hacking in recent years, often alleging a profit-driven motive that differentiates the activity from that of hackers in Russia and China.


In 2021, for instance, the department charged three North Korean computer programmers in a broad range of global hacks, including a destructive attack targeting an American movie studio, and in the attempted theft and extortion of more than $1.3 billion from banks and companies.


Investigators said Hyok has been a member of the Andariel Unit of the North Korean government's Reconnaissance General Bureau, a military intelligence agency. Hyok allegedly conspired to use ransomware software to conduct cyberespionage hacks against American hospitals and other government and technology entities in South Korea, and China.

## US economic growth increased last quarter to a healthy 2.8% annual rate

date: 2024-07-25, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The nation’s economy accelerated last quarter at a strong 2.8% annual pace, with consumers and businesses helping drive growth despite the pressure of continually high interest rates.


Thursday’s report from the Commerce Department said the gross domestic product — the economy’s total output of goods and services — picked up in the April-June quarter after growing at a 1.4% pace in the January-March period. Economists had expected a weaker 1.9% annual pace of growth.


The GDP report also showed that inflation continues to ease, though still remaining above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. The central bank’s favored inflation gauge rose at a 2.6% annual rate last quarter, down from 3.4% in the first quarter of the year.


Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation increased at a 2.9% pace. That was down from 3.7% from January through March.


The latest figures should reinforce confidence that the U.S. economy is on the verge of achieving a rare “soft landing,” whereby high interest rates, engineered by the Fed, tame inflation without tipping the economy into a recession.


Helping to boost last quarter's expansion was consumer spending, the heart of the U.S. economy. It rose at a 2.3% annual rate in the April-June quarter, up from a 1.5% pace in the January-March period. Spending on goods, such as cars and appliances, increased at a 2.5% rate after falling at a 2.3% pace in the first three months of the year.


Business investment was up last quarter, led by a 11.6% annual increase in equipment investment. Growth also picked up because businesses increased their inventories. On the other hand, a surge in imports, which are subtracted from GDP, shaved about 0.9 percentage point from the April-June growth.


Despite last quarter’s uptick, the U.S. economy, the world’s largest, has cooled in the face of the highest borrowing rates in decades. From mid-2022 through 2023, annualized GDP growth had topped 2% for six straight quarters. In last year’s final two quarters, GDP expanded by robust rates of 4.9% and 3.4%.


Fed officials have made clear that with inflation edging toward their 2% target level, they’re prepared to start cutting interest rates soon, something they’re widely expected to do in September.


“This is a perfect report for the Fed,” Olu Sonola, head of economic research at Fitch Ratings, said of Thursday’s GDP numbers. “Growth during the first half of the year is not too hot, inflation continues to cool, and the elusive soft-landing scenario looks within reach.”


The state of the economy has seized Americans’ attention as the presidential campaign has intensified. Though inflation has slowed sharply, to 3% from 9.1% in 2022, prices remain well above their pre-pandemic levels.


This year’s economic slowdown reflects, in large part, the much higher borrowing rates for home and auto loans, credit cards and many business loans resulting from the Fed’s aggressive series of interest rate hikes.


The Fed’s rate hikes — 11 of them in 2022 and 2023 — were a response to the flare-up in inflation that began in the spring of 2021 as the economy rebounded with unexpected speed from the COVID-19 recession, causing severe supply shortages. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 made things worse by inflating prices for the energy and grains the world depends on. Prices spiked across the country and the world.


Economists had long predicted that the higher borrowing costs would tip the United States into recession. Yet the economy kept chugging along. Consumers, whose spending accounts for roughly 70% of GDP, kept buying things, emboldened by a strong job market and savings they had built up during the COVID-19 lockdowns.


The slowdown at the start of this year was caused largely by two factors, each of which can vary sharply from quarter to quarter: A surge in imports and a drop in business inventories. Neither trend revealed much about the economy’s underlying health.

## FreeBSD as a platform for your future technology

date: 2024-07-25, from: OS News

Choosing an operating system for new technology can be crucial for the success of any project. Years down the road, this decision will continue to inform the speed and efficiency of development.&#160;But should you build the infrastructure yourself or rely on a proven system? When faced with this decision, many companies have chosen, and continue to choose, FreeBSD. Few operating systems offer the immediate high performance and security of FreeBSD, areas where new technologies typically struggle. Having a stable and secure development platform reduces upfront costs and development time. The combination of stability, security, and high performance has led to the adoption of FreeBSD in a wide range of applications and industries. This is true for new startups and larger established companies such as Sony, Netflix, and Nintendo. FreeBSD continues to be a dependable ecosystem and an industry-leading platform. ↫ FreeBSD Foundation A FreeBSD marketing document highlighting FreeBSD&#8217;s strengths is, of course, hardly a surprise, but considering it&#8217;s fighting what you could generously call an uphill battle against the dominance of Linux, it&#8217;s still interesting to see what, exactly, FreeBSD highlights as its strengths. It should come as no surprise that its licensing model &#8211; the simple BSD license &#8211; is mentioned first and foremost, since it&#8217;s a less cumbersome license to deal with than something like the GPL. It&#8217;s philosophical debate we won&#8217;t be concluding any time soon, but the point still stands. FreeBSD also highlights that it&#8217;s apparently quite easy to upstream changes to FreeBSD, making sure that changes benefit everyone who uses FreeBSD. While I can&#8217;t vouch for this, it does seem reasonable to assume that it&#8217;s easier to deal with the integrated, one-stop-shop that is FreeBSD, compared to the hodge-podge of hundreds and thousands of groups whose software all together make up a Linux system. Like I said, this is a marketing document so do keep that in mind, but I still found it interesting.

<p>From the BBC World Service: The stock market sell-off is spreading from the U.S. to Asia and Europe. There have been declines across the board, but companies specializing in AI and semiconductor chips have been hit especially hard. Part of it has to do with expectations of additional trade restrictions from the U.S. on chip trade with China. Then, smaller brands are competing against fashion giants to deck out this year&#8217;s Olympic athletes.</p>

During GE’s second quarter earnings call yesterday, CEO Scott Strazik and Vice President of Investor Relations Michael Lapides said the company had identified a “material deviation” at one of its factories in Canada and would “re-inspect all of the blades that we have made for offshore wind.” At a public meeting in Nantucket last night, Roger Martella, GE Vernova’s chief sustainability officer, said there were two issues at play. The first was the manufacturing issue — basically, the adhesives applied to the blade to hold it together did not do their job. The second was quality control. “The inspection that should have caught this did not,” he said. Two dozen turbines have been installed as part of the Vineyard Wind project so far, with 72 blades total. GE Vernova has not responded to requests for clarification about how many of them originated at the Canada facility, <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/vineyard-wind-answers?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ygkWMx7ig1_53E0FhCWukhxmdhiKVXVQMyuhI3hAebhLKiQWquH5UkaaOLi9RJR5U2lWe" rel="noopener" target="_self">reported Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo</a>.

The automaker reported adjusted earnings of 46 cents per share, far below analysts’ expectations of 68 cents per share.

That includes expanding its hybrid portfolio and prioritizing smaller, more affordable EVs. He said Ford “must do a much better job in educating our customers” about the advantages of owning an EV. “Overall, the EV journey has been humbling,” he said, “but it has forced us to get even more fit as a company.”

	Firefighters are battling hundreds of wildfires in Canada’s Alberta province, one of which is nearing a crucial oil pipeline. The Trans Mountain Pipeline carries 890,000 barrels of oil per day from Edmonton to Vancouver. Its operator is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/canadas-imperial-oil-reduces-non-essential-staff-kearl-wildfires-spread-2024-07-24/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ygkWMx7ig1_53E0FhCWukhxmdhiKVXVQMyuhI3hAebhLKiQWquH5UkaaOLi9RJR5U2lWe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reportedly</a> using sprinklers to protect the pipeline, which was still operating normally yesterday. Some oil producers with operations in Canada’s Fort McMurray oil sands region have pulled staff as a precaution and reduced production. “While wildfires have already forced some producers to curtail production, these fires still threaten a large amount of supply,” ING Group analysts said.
</p><h3>5. Study: Tree bark removes methane from atmosphere</h3><p>
	Microbes living in tree bark are surprisingly effective at removing methane from the atmosphere, according to a new <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07592-w?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ygkWMx7ig1_53E0FhCWukhxmdhiKVXVQMyuhI3hAebhLKiQWquH5UkaaOLi9RJR5U2lWe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> published in the journal <em><em>Nature</em></em>. Up until now, soil was the only known “terrestrial sink” for methane, a potent but short-lived greenhouse gas that’s responsible for about one third of the global warming since the pre-industrial age. But the research suggests tree bark may be just as effective as soil when it comes to methane removal. Trees are already climate champions because of their ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere, and the authors think these new findings boost their overall climate contribution <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/07/240724123005.htm?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ygkWMx7ig1_53E0FhCWukhxmdhiKVXVQMyuhI3hAebhLKiQWquH5UkaaOLi9RJR5U2lWe#:~:text=from%20the%20atmosphere.-,Tree%20bark%20surfaces%20play%20an%20important%20role%20in%20removing%20methane,a%20surprising%20additional%20climate%20benefit." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by about 10%</a>.

## Some US states purge Chinese companies from investments amid tensions with China

date: 2024-07-25, from: VOA News USA

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — As state treasurer, Vivek Malek pushed Missouri's main retirement system to pull its investments from Chinese companies, making Missouri among the first nationally to do so. Now Malek is touting the Chinese divestment as he seeks reelection in an August 6 Republican primary against challengers who also are denouncing financial connections to China.


The Missouri treasurer's race highlights a new facet of opposition to China, which has been cast as a top threat to the U.S. by many candidates seeking election this year. Indiana and Florida also have restricted their public pension funds from investing in certain Chinese companies. Similar legislation targeting public investments in foreign adversaries was vetoed in Arizona and proposed in Illinois and Oklahoma.


China ranks as the world's second-largest economy behind the U.S.


Between 2018 and 2022, U.S. public pension and university endowments invested about $146 billion in China, according to an analysis by Future Union, a nonprofit pro-democracy group led by venture capitalist Andrew King. The report said more than four-fifths of U.S. states have at least one public pension fund investing in China and Hong Kong.


"Frankly, there should be shame — more shame than there is — for continuing to have those investments at this point in time," said King, who asserts that China has used intellectual property from U.S. companies to make similar products that undercut market prices.


"You're talking a considerable amount of money that frankly is competing against the U.S. technology and innovation ecosystem," King said.


But some investment officials and economists have raised concerns that the emerging patchwork of state divestment policies could weaken investment returns for retirees.


"Most of these policies are unwise and would make U.S. citizens poorer," said Ben Powell, an economics professor who is executive director of the Free Market Institute at Texas Tech University.


The National Association of State Retirement Administrators opposes state-mandated divestments, saying such orders should come only from the federal government against specific companies based on U.S. security or humanitarian interests.




The U.S. Treasury Department recently proposed a rule prohibiting American investors from funding artificial intelligence systems in China that could have military uses, such as weapons targeting. In May, President Joe Biden blocked a Chinese-backed cryptocurrency mining firm from owning land near a Wyoming nuclear missile base, calling it a "national security risk."


Yet this isn't the first time that states have blacklisted particular investments. Numerous states, cities and universities divested from South Africa because of apartheid before the U.S. Congress eventually took action. Some states also have divested from tobacco companies because of health concerns.


Most recently, some states announced a divestment from Russia because of its war against Ukraine. But that has been difficult to carry out for some public pension fund administrators.


The quest to halt investments in Chinese companies comes as a growing number of states also have targeted Chinese ownership of U.S. land. Two dozen states now have laws restricting foreign ownership of agricultural land, according to the National Agricultural Law Center at the University of Arkansas. Some laws apply more broadly, such as one facing a legal challenge in Florida that bars Chinese citizens from buying property within 16 kilometers of military installations and critical infrastructure.


State pension divestment policies are "part of a broader march toward more confrontation between China and the United States," said Clark Packard, a research fellow for trade policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. But "it makes it more challenging for the federal government to manage the overall relationship if we've got to deal with a scattershot policy at the state level."


Indiana last year became the first to enact a law requiring the state's public pension system to gradually divest from certain Chinese companies. As of March 31, 2023, the system had about $1.2 billion invested in Chinese entities with $486 million subject to the divestment requirement. A year later, its investment exposure in China had fallen to $314 million with just $700,000 still subject to divestment, the Indiana Public Retirement System said.


Missouri State Treasurer Malek tried last November to get fellow trustees of the Missouri State Employees' Retirement System to divest from Chinese companies. After defeat, he tried again in December and won approval for a plan requiring divestment over a 12-month period. Officials at the retirement system did not respond to repeated questions from The Associated Press about the status of that divestment.


In recent weeks, Malek has highlighted the Chinese divestment in campaign ads, asserting that fentanyl from China "is drugging our kids" and vowing: "As long as I'm treasurer, they won't get money from us. Not one penny."


Two of Malek's main challengers in the Republican primary — state Rep. Cody Smith and state Sen. Andrew Koenig — also support divestment from China.


Koenig said China is becoming less stable and "a more risky place to have money invested."


"In China, the line between public and private is much more blurry than it is in America," Smith said. "So I don't think we can fully know that if we are investing in Chinese companies that we are not also aiding an enemy of the United States." 


A law signed earlier this year by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis requires a state board overseeing the retirement system to develop a plan by September 1 to divest from companies owned by China. The oversight board had announced in March 2022 that it would stop making new Chinese investments. As of May, it still had about $277 million invested in Chinese-owned entities, including banks, energy firms and alcohol companies, according to an analysis by Florida legislative staff.


Florida law already prohibits investment in certain companies tied to Cuba, Iran, Sudan, Venezuela, or those engaged in an economic boycott against Israel.


In April, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs vetoed a bill that would have required divestment from companies in countries determined by the federal government to be foreign adversaries. That list includes China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia and Venezuela.


Hobbs said in a letter to lawmakers that the measure "would be detrimental to the economic growth Arizona is experiencing as well as the State's investment portfolio."

## Former Trump NSC official explains his vision for ending war in Ukraine

date: 2024-07-25, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Retired Army Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg, who was chief of staff on former President Donald Trump’s national security council, spoke with VOA about his vision for ending the war in Ukraine.


Kellogg says he is not a formal adviser to the former president and has not presented his plan to Trump, but it is one of the options that he could consider if he is elected in November.


Kellogg also served as the national security adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence in the Trump administration. He now co-chairs the Center on American Security at America First Policy Institute, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group.


The Ukraine strategy was published back in May by AFPI as part of their An America First Approach to U.S. National Security, edited by Fred Fleitz, who also served as chief of staff at the National Security Council during Trump's presidency and co-wrote with Kellogg the chapter on the Russia-Ukraine war.


It suggests that the U.S. should begin a formal policy "to seek a cease-fire and negotiated settlement of the Ukraine conflict." The U.S. would continue to arm Ukraine to deter Russia from attacking during or after a deal is reached, but under the condition that Kyiv agrees to enter into peace talks with Russia.


To persuade Russia to participate in the negotiations, the U.S. and other NATO partners would delay Ukraine's membership in the alliance for an extended period in exchange for a "comprehensive and verifiable deal with security guarantees."


They write that Ukraine will not be asked to give up its ambition to regain all land seized by Russia, but Kyiv should agree to use diplomatic means only and realize that it might take a long time to regain all the territories. The strategy proposes to use the partial lifting of sanctions on Russia to encourage the Kremlin to take steps toward peace and establish levies on Russian energy imports to fund Ukraine's reconstruction.


The interview with Kellogg, recorded on July 18 at the Republican convention in Milwaukee, has been edited for brevity and clarity.


VOA: Can you tell a little bit about the plan? I think it's the most detailed paper coming publicly from Republican and Republican-affiliated groups.


Retired Army Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg: We've said very clearly in our paper that Ukraine has fought valiantly. They are very well led. We think the Russians did clearly an unwarranted invasion of a sovereign state and this must be addressed. President Trump, to his credit, said in the very first debate when he was asked by one of the commentators, Dana Bash, do the Russians basically get to keep the territories? He said no, not at all. He said not once, he did it twice.


So, there's a negotiation, you are going to figure out what your starting points are going to be. You want to make sure that Ukrainians are not put at the position when they're operating from weaknesses, but from strength. So, the question is how do you do that? And how you put all the pieces and parts in place? Nobody is ever saying that: "Oh, we just have to make Ukrainians to give up land and give it to Russia." Look when you look at your losses, the losses in Ukraine alone, depending on who you talk to, you're talking between 100,000 and 130,000 deaths. That's enormous because when I look at [Russia’s losses] they have had three times that. The United States of America lost 60,000 in the Vietnam war. That was a 20-year war we went away from. The Russians, then the Soviets, lost 15,000 in Afghanistan and walked away from it.


If the Ukrainians say no and the Russians say no, then they can do it in a different way. But I think you started to ask yourself questions is this what's best for Ukraine as a nation? I don't care about Russia. I care about Ukraine.


Let’s say a year and a half ago the Russians turn their heels and if the West had provided the equipment that [Ukrainian] President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy asked for, then you probably could have finished the job. You could have gotten into the Sea of Azov through Kherson, splitting them in half, and that is what you wanted to do. So, I blame this administration and the West to a degree for not supporting Ukraine when they should have.


VOA: The Biden administration is saying that they want to put Ukraine in the position of strength before it can negotiate with Russia. You are suggesting pretty much the same, right?


Kellogg: No, that’s a false statement. Have the United States given Ukraine a support of F-16s? No. Did we provide long-range fires early for the Ukrainians to shoot in Russians? No. Did we provide permission for them to shoot deep into Russia? No. Did the United States provide them the armored capabilities they needed? We gave 31 tanks. Thirty-one tanks is not even a battalion in the United States army. So, they talk about it, but it didn't really happen.


VOA: Ukrainian officials might be cautious about entering into the negotiations with Russians because it might send a signal to their partners that they don't need military aid anymore.


Kellogg: You have to give more arms to them because you can't trust the Russians. You just have to do it, and the question is, do you do this before Europe tires, Americans tire, Ukrainians tire? Two and a half years -- that's a long war and the destruction is enormous. Sometimes you have to look at what we call in America the long game. And that is security guarantees, financial support and military support. We have to bring that to the American people, you know, President Biden has only talked to American people one time. You got to talk to them a lot. President Biden has only talked to [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin one time. When I was with President Trump, he was talking to him 17 different times. It doesn’t mean he likes him. But you have to talk to your adversary.


VOA: Why would Russians want to negotiate?


Kellogg: You need to give them reasons to negotiate. You can give an extreme reason and say, OK, you've got to get back all the land from Ukraine. Maybe, short-term you tell Ukraine, we're not going to support you coming to NATO, but we give you a bilateral security agreement.


VOA: The U.S. and Ukraine have just signed a security agreement.


Kellogg: That was not a defense agreement. A defense agreement should be ratified by the Senate. What you have to do is to come up with a peace agreement like we've done with Korea, we did years ago with Taiwan.


VOA: But what is the contingency plan if Russia doesn’t abide by the agreement.


Kellogg: That is part of negotiation. That's where both sides draw the red lines. That's where both sides make the determination: this is what we're going to do or not do.


VOA: Ukraine already tried that signing the Minsk agreements with Russia.


Kellogg: Minsk agreements worked very well, didn't they? They're lousy. They didn't do anything because nobody trusted anybody, and nobody worked together. You had Minsk 1, failed; Minsk 2, failed. Budapest memorandum, failed. So, you have to have some kind of degree of confidence and security.


VOA: One of the reasons why the negotiations in Istanbul broke down was that Russians demanded Ukraine’s demilitarization, a smaller army.


Kellogg: Yes. And this is an unacceptable demand. And you don't walk into negotiating with unacceptable demands. But you have to have an ability, we call it an interlocutor. An interlocutor is somebody who can sit down and actually negotiate with both parties. It can be Trump, President Trump believes he can do it, but you also have to look at who else is out there. President [Recep Tayyip] Erdogan of Turkey, do you think he could do it? No, he's not going to do it. [Chancellor Olaf] Scholz from Germany, you think he will do it? No, he is not going to do it. [President Emmanuel] Macron from France, he tried but hasn't done it. Well, now they had a change in government in Britain. So that's gone away. You know, I don't know maybe [Klaus] Iohannis, [the president] of Romania. Maybe he could do it, but you have to have somebody that both sides could talk to.


President Trump is talking to both parties. And President Biden is not. Now the option is quite clear: If Ukraine doesn't want to negotiate, fine, but then accept the fact that you can have enormous losses in your cities and accept the fact that you will have your children killed, accept the fact that you don't have 130,000 dead, you will have 230,000–250,000. Demographically, what does that do to the country?


You have to accept the fact that maybe the threat will remain on Kyiv, you have to accept the fact that Kharkiv will have more damage or do you want to say this is time maybe we take a pause and figure out how to push the Russians out of there so that they don't get territorial gain. And how do you have a long-term peace agreement?


Let's use NATO as an example. NATO has already said they're not going to support Ukraine going into NATO until the war is over. That's the reality and that's where you need somebody to stand as a negotiator and say no, this is where we want to go.


The size of this war is not appreciated in the West. That is the largest war in Europe since World War II, it is between the two largest countries in Europe. The losses have been horrific.


It is too great of a country, and I've been there. I have been to Izyum, I've been to Kharkiv and I've seen what Russians did to it. There's no love for Russians. There's a support for sovereignty. Figure out a way does not mean we say give up land.


VOA: The other reason why the negotiations in Istanbul broke down is because it became known what happened in Bucha. It means that if Ukraine allows Russia to continue occupying any of its lands, it condemns the people who live there. ...


Kellogg: Who is saying to give up land?


VOA: Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance alluded to that.


Kellogg: J.D. Vance was just nominated as the vice president last night. Until that, he was just a senator, one of 100. Yeah, you can say a lot of things in the Senate. When you speak for an administration, things change.

## Black Boxes

date: 2024-07-25, from: Ed Summers blog, Inkdroid

<p>
One of the primary reasons I’ve resisted using machine learning models
in my professional work is that they always appear to me in the guise of
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box">black box</a>.
</p>
<p>
A black box is a metaphor used to talk about some computational process
which has known inputs and outputs, but whose internal workings are not
known. It’s an idea that goes back to the beginnings of cybernetics and
modern computing.
</p>
<p>
Computer professionals are trained to distinguish between the <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/model-explainability-aws-ai-ml/interpretability-versus-explainability.html">interpretability
and explainability</a> of machine learning models. But at the end of the
day our ability to understand and adequately communicate how and why
these models work are <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence">active
areas of research</a>.
</p>
<p>
Of course, our ability to understand is constrained because the details
of some models are guarded as business secrets. But more and more we are
seeing documentation efforts increase transparency about how “open
source” models are built. We’ve seen significant efforts to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence_Act">regulate</a>
how they are used and by who. But it’s important to recognize that even
these “Glass Boxes” don’t explain <em>why</em> some of the models work.
</p>
<p>
And that’s the <em>glass half full</em> version.
</p>
<p>
The <em>glass half empty</em> version is that <em>we do understand</em>
how these models work, if you define “we” as <em>someone</em>, or some
set of people, somewhere. The past isn’t evenly distributed too.
</p>
<p>
For a given model <em>someone</em> knows what software was used to build
it–because someone installed it right? Someone made choices about what
algorithms and data structures were used. Someone knows what data was
used to train it because they collected it and fed it in. Someone knows
what data was not fed in, and (maybe) how that biases the model. Someone
knows how much money was spent training and using the model because the
electricity bill got paid.
</p>
<p>
But these systems are very complex that these <em>someones</em> are
almost certainly not the same people. They may not work in the same
organizations. They may not be willing, or even able, to communicate
these things to you, even if you could find them.
</p>
<p>
This is why Nick Seaver says that algorithmic systems are in fact
<em>culture</em>, which require ethnographic methods to understand <span
class="citation" data-cites="Seaver:2017">(<a href="#ref-Seaver:2017"
role="doc-biblioref">Seaver, 2017</a>)</span>.
</p>
<p>
I got my start as a professional programmer when the World Wide Web was
being built in the mid-1990s. I didn’t have a computer science degree,
but I was fortunate to be able to lean on the modest programming
experience I got in high school (BASIC, Pascal and Fortran) to learn a
new language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl">Perl</a> and
apply it. I didn’t become a .com millionaire, but it helped pay the
rent. I felt lucky, and in truth I was. I was already a participant in a
network of privilege.
</p>
<p>
Perl had lots of features for working with text, which leant itself to
be useful in web applications. It had an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source</a> culture
that encouraged the sharing of “modules” on <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPAN">CPAN</a> that extended the
language to do things like talk to databases, or work with specific data
formats, or thousands of other things. I loved the attention to detail
in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_Perl">Camel
Book</a> about how the language was built and evolved. I knew that the
<a href="https://xkcd.com/378/">real programmers</a> had written the
Perl interpreter in C. I didn’t really know C that well, but I knew
other people did, and understood that (in theory) I could too. It was
all a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_matter_of_programming">simple
matter of programming</a>, as they say.
</p>
<p>
But the reality was, I didn’t know the details of some of the open
source Perl modules I installed and used. I <em>trusted</em> that the
authors did. I didn’t know how some of the Perl language primitives were
coded in C, but I learned from experience using them, while in
conversation with other programmers, and knew that someone else
somewhere did understand. I participated in the culture of programming
in Perl.
</p>
<p>
The scary thing for me about generative AI is that I don’t have any
meaningful trust relationships with the people who know parts of the
answers to why/how it works. At a fundamental level I don’t know if it
is even theoretically possible to know. Not only that, I have an active
<em>mistrust</em> of some of the organizations that are trying to
convince professionals that this is The New Way, because they stand to
gain so much, while workers and consumers stand to gain so little, and
the environment stands to lose so much more.
</p>
<p>
But, if I’m being generous, perhaps it appears that way because it’s not
my culture?
</p>
<p>
It’s important to recognize that all of us experience some aspect of
computing as a black box. Whether it is using a model from HuggingFace,
an ATM, an app on our phone, or ChatGPT. I think the important question
to ask is how do we participate in its the creation and use of this
technology?
</p>
<p>
Can we open the black box? Can we open the other black boxes we find
inside? Do we know other people who can? What do they say? What is the
culture of this black box? Do I want to be a part of it? Why? Why not?
What choices do I have? What about others?
</p>
<p>
I no longer program in Perl, but I still marvel at how <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall">Larry Wall</a> practiced
computing as a culture.

## Biden speaks, with hope and wistfulness, of decision to leave race

date: 2024-07-25, from: VOA News USA

washington — After three days of silence over his stunning decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, U.S. President Joe Biden took to prime time television Tuesday to give Americans, and the world, an explanation in a speech that was at times hopeful, at times determined, and at times wistful.


Biden spoke of his five decades in public office, touted his presidential record of domestic and political achievements – but then called for energetic new leadership to face tomorrow’s challenges.



"I revere this office,” said Biden, his hands resting on the glossy, hulking Resolute Desk, the gold-brocade drapes of the Oval Office framing his sloping shoulders. “But I love my country more.”




“Nothing – nothing – can come in the way of saving our democracy,” he said. “That includes personal ambition. So, I decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It’s the best way to unite our nation. You know, there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. There's also a time and a place for new voices. Fresh voices. Yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now.”


Biden also thanked Vice President Kamala Harris, who has taken to the campaign trail with his endorsement and enough delegate pledges to net the nomination. He described her as "experienced," "tough," and "capable" but added: “the choice is up to you.”


He did not name-check his Republican opponent in the race. But analysts say Biden’s stark warnings all point to one man.


“He talked about polarization,” said Jennifer Mercieca, a professor of communication and journalism at Texas A&M University. “He talked about violence and political violence. Those are all things that harken back to Donald Trump and his presidency. He talked about the threats facing the nation when he first took office, January 2021. And so that was certainly about Donald Trump. But yeah, this wasn't a place for him to talk about Donald Trump. It wasn't a place for him to give a campaign speech.”


Biden’s job now, he said, will focus on domestic challenges like civil rights and voter freedom, gun safety reforms, the quest to end cancer and Supreme Court reform. He also cited the various challenges the U.S. faces abroad, with wars raging in Gaza and Ukraine and China becoming more emboldened in the Indo-Pacific.


It’s those foreign fires, analysts say, that are likely to concern voters who were already worried about Biden’s future.


“That's really the concern I think people will have, which is: How does a lame duck president deal with foreign policy crises?” said Thomas Schwartz, a history professor at Vanderbilt University.


That question may be answered as soon as Thursday, when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits the White House in what administration officials told reporters Wednesday is an attempt to stitch up the first phase of a longer cease-fire deal that will end the brutal nine-month conflict in Gaza.


In a sign that foreign leaders may be hedging their bets in this electric American election cycle, the Israeli leader is also holding two other meetings while in the U.S., with Harris and Trump.


But for the final act of this presidency, Joe Biden remains the protagonist on America’s biggest stage. The ending, analysts say, is a classic.


“What has stopped Joe Biden is the thing that has stopped every human being since the beginning of time, and that is, we age,” said Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at the policy and research firm Third Way. “And it got to the point where I feel he could do the job, but he couldn't convince the American people that he could do the job.”




But this could also be a triumphant moment for the 81-year-old president, who was widely thanked by Democrats for making the decision to step aside.


”In some ways,” Kessler said, “he's like an athlete that is going to make the Hall of Fame and is retiring and gets the cheers from the crowds, finally, for a long, 50-year, tremendous career.”


Biden clearly understood that this address would be a dramatic peak. So, he used his final words to break the fourth wall, with a message as old as America:


“The great thing about America,” he said, “is here, kings and dictators do not rule, the people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands.”

## Surprise Yellowstone geyser eruption highlights little-known hazard at park

date: 2024-07-25, from: VOA News USA

BILLINGS, Montana — A surprise eruption of steam in a Yellowstone National Park geyser basin that sent people scrambling for safety as basketball-sized rocks flew overhead has highlighted a little-known hazard that scientists hope to be able to predict someday.


The hydrothermal explosion on Tuesday in Biscuit Basin caused no injuries as dozens of people fled down the boardwalk before the wooden walkway was destroyed. The blast sent rocks, steam, water and dirt high into the air, according to a witness and a scientist who reviewed video footage of the event.


It came in a park teeming with geysers, hot springs and other hydrothermal features that attracts millions of tourists annually. Some, like the famous Old Faithful, erupt like clockwork and are well understood by the scientists who monitor the park's seismic activity.


But the type of explosion that happened this week is less common and understood, and potentially more hazardous given that it occurs without warning.


"This drives home that even small events — and this one in the scheme of things was relatively small, if dramatic — can be really hazardous," said Michael Poland, lead scientist at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory. "We've gotten pretty good at being able to understand the signs that a volcano is waking up and may erupt. We don't have that knowledge base for hydrothermal systems like the one in Yellowstone."


Monitoring system


Poland and other scientists are trying to change that with a fledgling monitoring system that was recently installed in another Yellowstone geyser basin. It measures seismic activity, deformations in the Earth's surface and low-frequency acoustic energy that could signal an eruption.


The hydrothermal explosions are believed to result from clogged passageways in the extensive natural plumbing network under Yellowstone, Poland said. A clog could cause the heated, pressurized water to turn into steam instantly and explode.


Tuesday's explosion came with little warning.


Witness Vlada March, who captured widely circulated video of the explosion, said steam started rising in the Biscuit Basin "and within seconds, it became this huge thing. ... It just exploded and became like a black cloud that covered the sun."


March's tour guide, Isaac Fisher, told The Associated Press that he heard a hiss coming from Cliff Pool and told his group it was unusual. It looked like a geyser erupting 60 to 70 feet (18 to 21 meters) into the air for a few seconds and then, "Ba-boom!" he said.


"You felt the shock wave hit your chest and vibrate the bones in your chest," he said. "The explosion was so significant, you felt your feet shaking. You felt the boardwalk shake and you felt everything shaking."




He estimated the whole event lasted about 25 seconds as the debris plume climbed to about 100 meters (328 feet) into the air.


"I cannot believe nobody got hurt," Fisher said. "There were rocks whizzing over our heads that were the size of basketballs."


March's mother, who was closest to the eruption, pulled her hoodie over her head and face and wasn't injured, Fisher said.


Some of the rocks hurled into the air measured about a meter (3.3 feet) across, said Poland.


Slumbering volcano


Yellowstone encompasses the caldera of a huge, slumbering volcano that shows no sign of erupting anytime soon but provides the heat for the national park's famous geysers, hot springs, mud pots and various other hydrothermal features. While far less common than geyser eruptions, hydrothermal explosions happen often enough in Yellowstone to be studied — and to be a safety concern.


Scientists don't know if they'll be able to devise a way to predict the blasts, Poland said.


For a geologist, seeing one in person is a payday. That's what happened in 2009, when Montana Tech geology professor Mike Stickney and several other geologists were nearby when one happened close to the scene of Tuesday's blast in the Biscuit Basin.


"It was very sudden and without any detectable warning, just standing on the boardwalk there. It was just was one 'whoosh' and it was done. No one saw it coming," Stickney said.


Though it didn't register on a sensitive seismometer at Old Faithful a couple miles (3.2 kilometers) away, he estimated the recent explosion was 10 times bigger.


In May, after scientists found a crater a few feet (1-2 meters) wide in the Norris Geyser Basin 18 miles (29 kilometers) north of Biscuit Basin, they consulted acoustic and seismic data from the basin's new monitoring system and determined a hydrothermal explosion happened April 15, just a few days before roads opened for spring tourist season.


The data included no obvious precursors, however, that could potentially be used to develop a warning system.


Long-term study of where hydrothermal explosions and other ground disruptions can happen in Yellowstone is a focus of University of Wyoming geology professor Ken Sims, who has used ground-penetrating radar and other techniques to identify problem areas.


The information is critical to building roads and bridges in Yellowstone, he said.


"Whenever you build in a super active system like that, you have to pay attention to what's going on," Sims said.


A detection system takes time and money to develop, with monitoring stations that can cost roughly $30,000 each.


Yet even if explosions such as the recent one in Yellowstone could be predicted, there's no feasible way to prevent them, said Poland.


"One of the things people ask me occasionally is, 'How do you stop a volcano from erupting?' You don't. You get out of the way," Poland said. "For any of this activity, you don't want to be there when it happens."

## Wildfire smoke chokes parts of Canada and western US

date: 2024-07-25, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — Fires burning in California, Oregon, Arizona, Washington and other western states, as well as Canada, have filled the skies in regions of the western U.S. with smoke and haze, forcing some affected areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories.


As of Wednesday morning, there were 79 large active wildfires across the country being managed that have burned 1,431,460 acres (579,292 hectares), according to the National Interagency Fire Center.


Evacuation orders are in effect for 15 fires in the Northwest, where fires continue to show active to extreme behavior. Communities near several fires in California, the Northern Rockies and the Great Basin are also under evacuation orders.


Where are the big fires?


Oregon has 31 large active fires that have burned 791,653 acres (320,371 hectares). The Durkee Fire, the largest active blaze in the U.S., was burning near the Oregon-Idaho border and was 0% contained as of Wednesday morning and had burned nearly 400 square miles (1,036 square kilometers). The Cow Valley, Falls and Lone Rock fires, the next largest, have collectively seared some 404,404 acres (163,657 hectares).


There are 12 active large wildfires in both California and Arizona. In the Golden State, the Lake Fire in Santa Barbara has scorched 38,664 acres (15,647 hectares) and was 90% contained; the 2024 SQF Lightning Complex in Tulare has burned 31,309 acres (12,670 hectares) and was 7% contained; and the Shelly Fire in Siskiyou County that's charred 15,656 acres (6,336 hectares) was 62% contained. Hot, dry and windy conditions have increase fire activity in some areas, including the Hill Fire in northern California.


The Black Fire east of Phoenix is the largest in Arizona, followed by the Romero Fire west of Dudleyville.


The Pioneer Fire in Washington is the largest in the state at 30,667 acres (12,410.5 hectares). In Montana, the Deadman Fire in Rosebud County grew to 19,982 acres (8,086 hectares) and was 95% contained.


In Canada, there are about 430 active wildfires in British Columbia and 177 in neighboring Alberta, including two that led to the evacuation of up to 25,000 visitors and residents of Canadian Rockies' largest national park.


Fuels and fire behavior advisories were in effect for California, Nevada, Southeast and Central Oregon, Southern Idaho and the Utah and Arizona Strip.


What areas are under air quality alerts?


Unhealthy air pollution from wildfires have triggered air quality alerts and advisories in regions of the western U.S.


The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality issued air quality alerts for the eastern counties of Harney, Malheur, Grant, Baker and Morrow until further notice. Unhealthy air was reported in cities of Bend and La Pine today and forecaster for tomorrow, with smoke expected to continue degrading air quality in La Pine after Thursday. Smoke from the Durkee Fire was choking the air in Boise, Idaho and beyond. An air quality warning was in effect for the entire region on Wednesday.


In Idaho, air quality advisories were sent out to the central counties of Ada, Canyon, Gem, Owyhee, Payette and Washington.


In north central Washington, the Colville Reservation, all of Chelan County, plus the Methow Valley down to Brewster in Okanogan County were under air quality alerts until further notice.


And in Canada, authorities issued an air quality advisory for Calgary, Alberta due to the wildfire smoke. The government agency called it high risk and said children and the elderly should avoid outdoor physical exertion.


How do I stay safe from wildfire smoke?


Wildfire smoke can cause unhealthy air quality in areas many miles away from fires. To stay safe, the South Coast Air Quality Management District recommends people start by learning about air quality conditions and forecasts in their area.


Those with an air conditioning system should change filters often, with high-efficiency filters labeled "MERV13" or higher being the most effective at removing smoke particles. Portable HEPA air purifiers also help.


To limit exposure to unhealthy air quality, people should stay indoors with windows and doors closed. Avoid heavy exertion outdoors, using fans or swamp coolers that take air from outside, all wood-burning appliances, and lighting candles and incense.


If you need to be outside in smoky conditions, a respirator mask such as an N-95 or P-100 can offer some protection.


Lastly, know your risks. Some people, such as children and those with heart or lung issues, can be more sensitive to moderate to unhealthy air quality.

## Democrats poised to virtually nominate Harris and running mate by August 7

date: 2024-07-25, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — Democratic National Convention delegates can make Vice President Kamala Harris their presidential nominee — and even start approving her yet-to be-named running mate — in online voting beginning next week, as the party races to coalesce around a new top of its ticket heading into November.


The convention's rules committee on Wednesday passed a proposal where delegates from around the country will be able to vote on potential presidential nominees to replace President Joe Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid last weekend.


But Harris is the only major Democrat to announce publicly that she's seeking the nomination, meaning she'll almost-certainly be approved in a single round of virtual balloting beginning August 1 — some 18 days before the party's convention opens in Chicago.


Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison referenced the unprecedented shakeup in the presidential race left by Biden's bowing out, telling a virtual meeting of the convention's rulemaking arm, "In the darkness of night, we see our brightest stars."


The plan was approved after more than 90 minutes of online discussion that featured little objection. The final vote to pass the full set of convention's rules was 157-3.


They require Harris, and any other potential Democrat willing to challenge her, to submit 300 electronic signatures from convention delegates, not more than 50 of whom can be from the same state, by the evening of July 30.


If multiple candidates qualify, it could spark multiple rounds of voting over several days. But, if Harris is the only candidate, voting would begin August 1. Delegates voting "uncommitted," or for another candidate who hasn't qualified under the rules, will have their choices converted simply to "present."


Delegates will receive ballots via secure email. The process will be designed not only to formally nominate Harris, but to eventually do the same for her vice presidential selection prior to August 7 — giving her a tight window to pick a running mate.


Who she might choose is unclear. Early favorites include Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, but potentially half a dozen other candidates are being considered.


Biden dropped out of the race last weekend and endorsed Harris, and hundreds of Democratic members of Congress and governors, as well as leading labor unions and activist organizations have since backed her to replace him. An Associated Press survey of delegates to the convention also revealed that the vice president has the support of well more than the 1,976 delegates she'll need to win on a first ballot.


That doesn't automatically make her the nominee, though, and the party is pushing ahead with the virtual voting process because it says it can't wait until the convention starts to formally choose its nominee. It blames a deadline to appear on the Ohio ballot stating that candidates must be selected by August 7.


Ohio state lawmakers there have since changed that, but the modification doesn't take effect until September 1 — and DNC attorneys warn that waiting until after the initial deadline to determine a presidential nominee could prompt legal challenges.


"Our party remains steadfast to an open, fair and transparent nominating process," said Minyon Moore, chair of the Democratic convention. "We will do this right."

## Missouri high court blocks release of man whose conviction was overturned

date: 2024-07-25, from: VOA News USA

ST. LOUIS, missouri — The Missouri Supreme Court has blocked the immediate release of a man whose murder conviction was overturned — just as the man was about to walk free.


A St. Louis Circuit Court judge had ordered Christopher Dunn to be released by 6 p.m. CDT Wednesday and threatened the prison warden with contempt if Dunn remained imprisoned. But the attorney general has been fighting his release.


Corrections Department spokeswoman Karen Pojmann said Dunn was signing paperwork to be released when the Missouri Supreme Court issued a stay, blocking his freedom. His wife was en route to pick him up.


St. Louis Circuit Judge Jason Sengheiser's decision to release Dunn came after he overturned Dunn's murder conviction Monday, citing evidence of "actual innocence" in the 1990 killing. He ordered Dunn's immediate release then, but Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey appealed, and the state Department of Corrections declined to release him.


St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore filed a motion Wednesday urging the judge to immediately order Dunn's freedom.


"The attorney general cannot unilaterally decide to ignore this court's order," Gore wrote.




A court filing said an attorney for the Department of Corrections told a lawyer in Gore's office that Bailey advised the agency not to release Dunn until the appeal played out. When told it was improper to ignore a court order, the Department of Corrections attorney "responded that the attorney general's office is legal counsel to the DOC and the DOC would be following the advice of counsel."


On Wednesday, Sengheiser said the prison in Licking had until 6 p.m. CDT to release Dunn, or he would hold an order for the warden to be held in contempt of court.


"Barring a new court order that supersedes the current court order, Mr. Dunn will be released before 6 p.m.," Missouri Corrections Department spokeswoman Karen Pojmann said in an email to The Associated Press, later texting that she expected him to be released in about an hour.


"It shouldn't be this hard," said Dunn's attorney, Tricia Rojo Bushnell, the executive director of the Midwest Innocence Project.


'Over the moon'


Dunn's wife told the AP she couldn't believe the news.


"I'm over the moon," Kira Dunn said as she headed to the prison.


"We're so grateful to the judge. We're so grateful that he didn't allow his ruling to be disrespected that way and he put his foot down and said, 'You will respect the rule of law and you will respect a court order.' "


She said her husband looks forward to being freed after decades of longing to embrace his family for as long as he wants and having "a say in his own life."


"He wants to just feel free ground against his feet. He wants to walk barefoot. He wants to open and close doors as he chooses. He wants to select the temperature of his shower. He wants to go out in the middle of the night and look at the stars and just sit there. And, he wants to sleep in a real bed," she said.


Dunn's situation is similar to what happened to Sandra Hemme.


The 64-year-old woman spent 43 years in prison for the fatal stabbing of a woman in St. Joseph in 1980. A judge on June 14 cited evidence of "actual innocence" and overturned her conviction. She had been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to the National Innocence Project, which worked to free Hemme.




But appeals by Bailey — all the way up to the Missouri Supreme Court — kept Hemme imprisoned at the Chillicothe Correctional Center. During a court hearing Friday, Judge Ryan Horsman said that if Hemme wasn't released within hours, Bailey himself would have to appear in court with contempt of court on the table. She was released later that day.


Judicial scolding


The judge also scolded Bailey's office for calling the Chillicothe warden and telling prison officials not to release Hemme after he ordered her to be freed on her own recognizance.


Dunn was convicted of first-degree murder in the 1990 shooting of Ricco Rogers, 15. Gore's office examined the case and filed a motion in February seeking to vacate the guilty verdict.


After weighing the case for nearly two months, Sengheiser issued a ruling that cited "a clear and convincing showing of 'actual innocence' that undermines the basis for Dunn's convictions, because in light of new evidence, no juror, acting reasonably, would have voted to find Dunn guilty of these crimes beyond a reasonable doubt."


Lawyers for Bailey's office said at the hearing that initial testimony from two boys at the scene who identified Dunn as the shooter was correct, even though they recanted as adults.


A Missouri law adopted in 2021 lets prosecutors request hearings when they see evidence of a wrongful conviction. Although Bailey's office is not required to oppose such efforts, he also did so at a hearing for Lamar Johnson, who spent 28 years in prison for murder. Another St. Louis judge ruled in February 2023 that Johnson was wrongfully convicted, and he was freed.


Another hearing begins August 21 for death row inmate Marcellus Williams. Bailey's office is opposing the challenge to Williams' conviction, too. Timing is of the essence: Williams is scheduled to be executed September 24.


St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell filed a motion in January to vacate the conviction of Williams for the fatal stabbing of Lisha Gayle in 1998. Bell's motion said three experts determined that Williams' DNA was not on the handle of the butcher knife used in the killing.


Steven Puro, professor emeritus of political science at St. Louis University, said Bailey is in a highly competitive race for the attorney general position, with the primary quickly approaching on August 6.


"Bailey is trying to show that he is 'tough on crime,' which is a very important Republican conservative position. Clearly, he's angering members of the judicial system that he will have to argue before in the future. But he's making the strategic notion that he needs to get his name before the voters and try to use that to win the primary election."


'Court has to be obeyed'


Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and chief justice, concurred with Puro's observation, saying the handling of the case appears to be influenced by politics, also noting that the primary is quickly approaching.


"Does August 6 have anything to do with it?" he asked.


"If there's a finding of actual innocence and there's no case left, then that's all," Wolff said. "Then it seems to me that it's just whatever he believes and whatever his political instincts tell him to do. But one of the things is that no matter what your beliefs are, if a court orders something to happen, it's not your purview to say no. The court has to be obeyed."

## Re-introducing Participation Reports to encourage best practices in open metadata

date: 2024-07-25, from: Crossref Blog

<p>We’ve just released an update to our <a href="http://crossref.org/members/prep" target="_blank">participation report</a>, which provides a view for our members into how they are each working towards best practices in open metadata. Prompted by some of the signatories and organizers of the <a href="https://barcelona-declaration.org/" target="_blank">Barcelona Declaration</a>, which Crossref supports, and with the help of our friends at <a href="https://www.cwts.nl/" target="_blank">CWTS Leiden</a>, we have fast-tracked the work to include an updated set of metadata best practices in participation reports for our members. The reports now give a more complete picture of each member’s activity.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-mean-by-participation">What do we mean by ‘participation’?</h2>
<p>Crossref runs open infrastructure to link research objects, entities, and actions, creating a lasting and reusable scholarly record. As a not-for-profit with over 20,000 members in 160 countries, we drive metadata exchange and support nearly 2 billion monthly API queries, facilitating global research communication.</p>
<p>To make this system work, members strive to provide as much metadata as possible through Crossref to ensure it is openly distributed throughout the scholarly ecosystem at scale rather than bilaterally, thereby realizing the collective benefit of membership. Together, our membership provides and uses a rich nexus of information— known as <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus">the research nexus</a>—on which the community can build tools to help progress knowledge.</p>
<p>Each member commits to certain terms, such as keeping metadata current, updating links for their DOIs to redirect to, linking references and other objects, and preserving their content in perpetuity. Beyond this, we also encourage members to register as much rich metadata as is relevant and possible.</p>
<p>Creating and providing richer metadata is a key part of participation in Crossref; we’ve long encouraged a more complete scholarly record, such as through <a href="https://metadata2020.org" target="_blank">Metadata 20/20</a>, and through supporting or leading initiatives for specific metadata, like open citations (I4OC), open abstracts (I4OA), open contributors (<a href="https://orcid.org" target="_blank">ORCID</a>), and open affiliations (<a href="https://ror.org" target="_blank">ROR</a>).</p>
<h2 id="which-metadata-elements-are-considered-best-practices">Which metadata elements are considered best practices?</h2>
<p>Alongside basic bibliographic metadata such as title, authors, and publication date(s), we encourage members to register metadata in the following fields:</p>
<div class="shortcode-divwrap ">
<span><figure><a href="https://crossref.org/members/prep/5401"><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/prep-2024.png"

<p>Example participation report for Crossref member University of Szeged</p>
</figcaption>
</figure></span>
</div>
<h4 id="references">References</h4>
<p>A list of all the references used by a work. This is particularly relevant for journal articles but the references can include any type of object, including datasets, versions, preprints, and more. Additionally, we encourage these to be added into <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/principles-practices/best-practices/relationships/">relationships</a>, where relevant.</p>
<h4 id="abstracts">Abstracts</h4>
<p>A description of the work. These are particularly useful for discovery systems that will promote the work, and are often used in downstream analyses such as for detecting integrity issues.</p>
<h4 id="contributor-ids-orcid">Contributor IDs (ORCID)</h4>
<p>All authors should be included in a work’s metadata, ideally alongside their verified ORCID identifier.</p>
<h4 id="affiliations--affiliation-ids-ror">Affiliations / Affiliation IDs (ROR)</h4>
<p>Members are able to register contributor affiliations as free text, but we are encouraging everyone to add ROR IDs for affiliations as the recommended best practice, as this differentiates and avoids mistyping. These two fields have newly been added to the participation reports interface in the most recent update.</p>
<h4 id="funder-ids-ofr">Funder IDs (OFR)</h4>
<p>Acknowledging the organization(s) that funded the work. We encourage the inclusion of <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/funder-registry/">Open Funder Registry</a> identifiers to make the funding metadata more usable. This will evolve into <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/open-funder-registry-to-transition-into-research-organization-registry-ror/">an additional use case for ROR</a> over time.</p>
<h4 id="funding-award-numbers--grant-ids-crossref">Funding award numbers / Grant IDs (Crossref)</h4>
<p>A number or identifier assigned by the funding organization to identify the specific award of funding or other support such as use of equipment or facilities, prizes, tuition, etc. The <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/grant-linking-system/">Crossref Grant Linking System</a> includes a unique persistent link that can be connected with outputs, activities, people, and organizations.</p>
<h4 id="crossmark">Crossmark</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/crossmark/">Crossmark service</a> gives readers quick and easy access to the current status of a record, including any corrections, retractions, or updates, via a button embedded on PDFs or a web article. Openly adding corrections, retractions, and errata is critical part of publishing, and the button provides readers with an easy in-context alert.</p>
<h4 id="similarity-check-urls">Similarity Check URLs</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/similarity-check/">Similarity Check service</a> helps editors to identify text-based plagiarism through our collective agreement for the membership to access to Turnitin’s powerful text comparison tool, iThenticate. Specific fill-text links are required to participate in this service.</p>
<h4 id="license-urls">License URLs</h4>
<p>URLs pointing to a license that explains the terms and conditions under which readers can access content. These links are crucial to denote intended downstream use.</p>
<h4 id="text-mining-urls">Text mining URLs</h4>
<p>Full-text URLs that help researchers in meta-science easily locate your content for text and data mining.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-participation-report">What is a participation report?</h2>
<p>Participation reports are are a visualization of the data representing members’ participation to the scholarly record which is available via our open REST API. There’s a separate participation report for each member, and each report shows what percentage of that member’s metadata records include 11 key metadata elements. These key elements add context and richness, and help to open up members work to easier discovery and wider and more varied use. As a member, you can use participation reports to see for yourself where the gaps in your organization’s metadata are, and perhaps compare your performance to others. Participation reports are free and open to everyone - so you can also check the report for any other members you are interested in.</p>
<p>We first <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/321-its-lift-off-for-participation-reports/">introduced</a> participation reports in 2018. At the time, Anna Tolwinska and Kirsty Meddings wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Metadata is at the heart of all our services. With a growing range of members participating in our community—often compiling or depositing metadata on behalf of each other—the need to educate and express obligations and best practice has increased. In addition, we’ve seen more and more researchers and tools making use of our APIs to harvest, analyze and re-purpose the metadata our members register, so we’ve been very aware of the need to be more explicit about what this metadata enables, why, how, and for whom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of that still rings true today. But as the research nexus continues to evolve, so should the tools that intend to reflect it. For example, in 2022, we removed the <em>Open references</em> field from participation reports after <a href="blog/amendments-to-membership-terms-to-open-reference-distribution-and-include-uk-jurisdiction/">a board vote to change our policy and update the membership terms</a> meant that <em>all</em> references deposited with Crossref would be open by default. And now we’ve expanded the list of fields again, adding coverage data for contributor affiliation text and ROR identifiers.</p>
<h2 id="putting-it-in-practice">Putting it in practice</h2>
<p>To find out how you measure up when it comes to participation, type the name of your member organization into the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/" target="_blank">search box</a>. You may be surprised by what you find—we often speak to members who thought they were registering a certain type of metadata for all their records, only to learn from their participation report that something is getting lost along the way.</p>
<p>You can only <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/maintaining-your-metadata/updating-your-metadata/">address</a> gaps in your metadata if you know that they exist.</p>
<p>More information, as well as a breakdown of the now 11 key metadata elements listed in every participation report and tips on improving your scores, is available in our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/reports/participation-reports/">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>And if you have any questions or feedback, come talk to us on the <a href="https://community.crossref.org/" target="_blank">community forum</a> or request a metadata Health Check by emailing the <a href="mailto:feedback@crossref.org?subject=Participation%20reports%20and%20metadata%20health%20checks">community team</a>.</p>
