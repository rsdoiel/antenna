If the Democrats want 10 or 20 percent of Republican voters they should stop blaming men for things they don’t control. I know people don’t want to hear this, but what if preserving democracy depends on you listening.

At this late stage the NYT should announce that they realize this election is the last gasp for American democracy, and they played a big role in taking it down, and in penance they are shutting down, possibly permanently. If democracy survives, they might come back, begging forgiveness.

## Solving the mystery of ARM7TDMI multiply carry flag

date: 2024-10-23, from: OS News

The processor in the Game Boy Advance, the ARM7TDMI, has a weird characteristic where the carry flag is set to a &#8220;meaningless value&#8221; after a multiplication operation. What this means is that software cannot and should not rely on the value of the carry flag after multiplication executes. It can be set to anything. Any value. 0, 1, a horse, whatever. This has been a source of memes in the emulator development community for a few years &#8211; people would frequently joke about how the implementation of the carry flag may as well be&#160;cpu.flags.c = rand() &#38;amp; 1;. And they had a point &#8211; the carry flag seemed to defy all patterns; nobody understood why it behaves the way it does. But the one thing we did know, was that the carry flag seemed to be&#160;deterministic. That is, under the same set of inputs to a multiply instruction, the flag would be set to the same value. This was big news, because it meant that understanding the carry flag could give us key insight into how this CPU performs multiplication. And just to get this out of the way, the carry flag’s behavior after multiplication isn’t an important detail to emulate at all. Software doesn’t rely on it. And if software&#160;did&#160;rely on it, then screw the developers who wrote that software. But the carry flag is a meme, and it’s a really tough puzzle, and that was motivation enough for me to give it a go. Little did I know it’d take&#160;3 years&#160;of on and off work. ↫ bean machine Please don&#8217;t make me understand any of this.

## bhyve on FreeBSD and VM live migration: quo vadis?

date: 2024-10-23, from: OS News

When I think about bhyve Live Migration, it’s something I encounter almost daily in my consulting calls. VMware’s struggles with Broadcom’s licensing issues have been a frequent topic, even as we approach the end of 2024. It’s surprising that many customers still feel uncertain about how to navigate this mess. While VMware has been a mainstay in enterprise environments for years, these ongoing issues make customers nervous. And they should be – it’s hard to rely on something when even the licensing situation feels volatile. Now, as much as I’m a die-hard FreeBSD fan, I have to admit that FreeBSD still falls short when it comes to virtualization – at least from an enterprise perspective. In these environments, it’s not just about running a VM; it’s about having the flexibility and capabilities to manage workloads without interruption. Years ago, open-source solutions like KVM (e.g., Proxmox) and Xen (e.g., XCP-ng) introduced features like live migration, where you can move VMs between hosts with zero downtime. Even more recently, solutions like SUSE Harvester (utilizing KubeVirt for running VMs) have shown that this is now an essential part of any virtualization ecosystem. ↫ gyptazy FreeBSD has bhyve, but the part where it falls short, according to gyptazy, is the tool&#8217;s lack of live migration. While competitors and alternatives allow for virtual machines to be migrated without downtime, bhyve users still need to shut down their VMs, interrupt all connections, and thus experience a period of downtime before everything is back up and running again. This is simply not acceptable in most enterprise environments, and as such, bhyve is not an option for most users of that type. Luckily for enterprise FreeBSD users, things are improving. Live migration of bhyve virtual machines is being worked on, and basic live migration is now supported, but with limitations. For instance, only virtual machines with a maximum of 3GB could be migrated live, but that limit has been raised in recent years to 13 to 14GB, which is a lot more palatable. There are also some issues with memory corruption, as well as some other issues. Still, it&#8217;s a massive feat to have live migration at all, and it seems to be improving every year. The linked article goes into much greater detail about where things stand, so if you&#8217;re interested in keeping up with the latest progress regarding bhyve&#8217;s live migration capabilities, it&#8217;s a great place to start.

## Qualcomm announces Snapdragon 8 Elite flagship smartphone SoC

date: 2024-10-23, from: OS News

At the Snapdragon Summit today, Qualcomm is officially announcing the Snapdragon 8 Elite, its flagship SoC for smartphones. The Snapdragon 8 Elite is a major upgrade from its predecessor, with improvements across the board. Qualcomm is also changing its naming scheme for its flagship SoCs from Snapdragon 8 Gen X to Snapdragon X Elite. ↫ Pradeep Viswanathan at Neowin It&#8217;s wild &#8211; but not entirely unexpected &#8211; how we always seem to end up in a situation in technology where crucial components, such as the operating system or processor, are made by one, or at most two, companies. While there are a few other smartphone system-on-a-chip vendors, they&#8217;re mostly relegated to low-end devices, and can&#8217;t compete on the high end, where the money is, at all. It&#8217;s sadness. Speaking of our mobile SoC overlords, they seem to be in a bit of a pickle when it comes to their core business of, well, selling SoCs. In short, Qualcomm bought Nuvia to use its technology to build the current crop of Snapdragon X Elite and Pro laptop chips. According to ARM, Qualcomm does not have an ARM license to do so, and as such, a flurry of lawsuits between the two companies followed. ARM is now cancelling certain Qualcomm ARM licenses, arguing specifically its laptop Snapdragon X chips should be destroyed. What we&#8217;re looking at here is two industry giants engaged in very public, and very expensive, contract negotiations, using the legal system as their arbiter. This will eventually fizzle out into a new agreement between the two companies with renewed terms and conditions &#8211; and flows of money &#8211; but until that dust has settled, be prepared for an endless flurry of doomerist news items about this story. As for us normal people? We don&#8217;t have to worry one bit about this legal nonsense. It&#8217;s not like we have any choice in smartphone chips anyway.
