Swedish automaker Volvo has rolled out its last diesel-powered passenger
vehicle, after a 45-year relationship with the powertrain and cranking
out millions of oil-burning cars. Between 2012 and 2016, diesel
accounted for half of the company’s global sales. But those days are
over now as the company moves toward an all-electric future.

id="texas-migrant-arrest-law-on-hold-for-now-under-latest-court-ruling">Texas’
Migrant Arrest Law on Hold for Now Under Latest Court Ruling</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW ORLEANS — A Texas law that allows the state to arrest and deport
migrants suspected of illegally entering the U.S. will remain on hold
for now, a federal appeals court ruled.</p>
<p>The 2-1 ruling late Tuesday from a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals followed a March 20 hearing by a three-judge
panel of the court. It’s just the latest move in a seesaw legal case
over Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s strict new immigration law that is
not yet ended.</p>
<p>The Justice Department has argued that Texas’ law is a clear
violation of federal authority and would create chaos at the border.
Texas has argued that President Joe Biden’s administration isn’t doing
enough to control the border and that the state has a right to take
action.</p>
<p>Judge Andrew Oldham, an appointee of former President Donald Trump
and a former aide to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, dissented with the majority
decision.</p>
<p>Oldham wrote that the Biden administration faced a high bar to take
sovereign power that Texas has to enforce a law its people and leaders
want. The judge predicted the same 2-1 split when the merits of the case
are considered while the legal challenge plays out.</p>
<p>“There is real peril in this approach. In our federal system, the
State of Texas is supposed to retain at least some of its sovereignty,”
Oldham wrote. “Its people are supposed to be able to use that
sovereignty to elect representatives and send them to Austin to debate
and enact laws that respond to the exigencies that Texans experience and
that Texans want addressed.”</p>
<p>The law was in effect for several hours on March 19 after the U.S.
Supreme Court cleared the way. But the high court didn’t rule on the
merits of the case. It instead sent the case back to the 5th Circuit,
which then suspended enforcement while it considered the latest
appeal.</p>
<p>The latest ruling keeps the block in place.</p>
<p>Spokespersons for Abbott and state Attorney General Ken Paxton did
not immediately return phone calls for comment Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>The law signed by Abbott allows any Texas law enforcement officer to
arrest people suspected of entering the country illegally, but that
brief window while the law was in effect revealed that many sheriffs
were unprepared, unable or uninterested in enforcing SB4 in the first
place.</p>
<p>Sheriff Thaddeus Cleveland of Terrell County, which touches more than
50 miles (80 kilometers) of border, said during a gathering of about 100
sheriffs at the state Capitol last week said there’s no practical way
for him to enforce the law.</p>
<p>Cleveland said he has no way to transport people, the county jail has
space for just seven people and the closest port of entry is a drive of
more than 2 1/2 hours away.</p>
<p>Smith County Sheriff Larry Smith, president of the Texas Sheriff’s
Association, said the law will have little effect in his jurisdiction in
East Texas, which is closer to Louisiana and Oklahoma than Mexico which
is nearly 400 miles (644 kilometers) away.</p>
<p>Once in custody, migrants could either agree to a Texas judge’s order
to leave the U.S. or be prosecuted on misdemeanor charges of illegal
entry. Migrants who don’t leave could face arrest again under more
serious felony charges.</p>
<p>Texas did not announce any arrests during the brief time the law was
previously in effect. Authorities have offered various explanations for
how they might enforce the law. Mexico has said it would refuse to take
back anyone who is ordered by Texas to cross the border.</p>
<p>The law is considered by opponents to be the most dramatic attempt by
a state to police immigration since an Arizona law more than a decade
ago that was partially struck down by the Supreme Court. Critics have
also said the Texas law could lead to civil rights violations and racial
profiling.</p>
<p>Supporters have rejected those concerns, saying arresting officers
must have probable cause, which could include witnessing the illegal
entry or seeing it on video. They also say that they expect the law
would be used mostly in border counties, though it would apply
statewide.</p>

Trial Date Set for Ex-Official Accused of Killing Vegas Journalist</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LAS VEGAS, NEVADA — A Nevada judge tentatively set an August 5 trial
date for a former Las Vegas-area elected official accused of killing an
investigative journalist.</p>
<p>But she acknowledged that more time might be needed to finish
searching the slain reporter’s computers for possible evidence.</p>
<p>Robert Telles, a former Democratic county administrator of estates,
has pleaded not guilty to stabbing Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter
Jeff German to death in September 2022.</p>
<p>Telles, 47, has remained jailed since his arrest days after German’s
body was found. Telles and his lawyer, Robert Draskovich, say he wants
his murder trial to start as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Clark County District Court Judge Michelle Leavitt decided two weeks
ago that a March 18 date was unrealistic. She agreed with prosecutors on
Tuesday that August might also be too soon, but she said it was
important to have a date to work toward.</p>
<p>Progress in the case stalled while arguments went to the state
Supreme Court about opening German’s cellphone and computers, possibly
exposing confidential information that is protected from disclosure
under state and federal law.</p>
<p>Review-Journal employees are now reviewing those files, and attorneys
say it might take months to finish.</p>
<p>German, 69, was found stabbed outside his home months after he wrote
articles in 2022 that were critical of Telles and his managerial conduct
while he was in elected office.</p>

development for an industry that had been bogged down by inflation,
higher borrowing costs and supply-chain woes,”
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=99d0232575&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>
<em>Bloomberg</em>. The seven projects in total have the potential to

<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Deadly Baltimore bridge collapse halts coal shipments
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Six people are presumed dead after Baltimore’s Francis
Scott Key Bridge collapsed yesterday. The search continues for their
remains. The disaster has halted the flow of ships in and out of the
Port of Baltimore indefinitely, and this could have knock-on economic
effects. It’s already throwing the U.S. coal market for a loop,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0c8c2eca2c&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported
Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin</a>. The port plays a pivotal role in the
energy trade, as it is the second largest coal export facility in the
country. One coal shipping executive told <em>Bloomberg</em> the
disruption could last more than a month. Shares of Consol Energy, which
ships more than 10 million tons of coal annually through a terminal at
the Port of Baltimore, were down 7% yesterday. In terms of its effects
on the overall energy market, the port’s indefinite closure could be
mild and may actually result in lower energy prices in the Northeast, as
coal that would have been exported becomes, essentially, stranded
stateside, Greg Brew, an analyst at the Eurasia Group, told Zeitlin. But
even this effect may be muted, Brew explained, because the weather is
warming up with the end of winter, meaning there’s less demand on
natural gas for heating.

Prices dropped slightly later in the day, but the overall trend is not
good: Cocoa has more than tripled in cost over the past year,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=31a4ff8030&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to</a> CNBC. Two countries in West Africa – Ivory Coast and Ghana –
produce around two-thirds of the world’s cocoa beans. Heavy rainfall
followed by dry heat in the region has hurt crop yields, and many
farmers are abandoning the trade for other crops. “It rains outside of
the rainy seasons now,” one cocoa plantation owner in Ghana
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=719ee3426c&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told
the <em>FT</em></a>. “Dry seasons are hotter than they used to be.”
Consumers could start to feel the pinch soon in the form of smaller
chocolate bars for higher prices. Dark chocolate, which has a high cocoa
content, will likely see the biggest price hike.

<li>Western U.S. hydropower dips due to drought
</h3>
<p>
The amount of hydropower generated in the western U.S. plummeted last
year because of drought,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=8e95933ec9&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to</a> the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Eleven states –
Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming,
California, Oregon, and Washington – produce nearly 60% of the nation’s
hydroelectricity. Between October 1, 2022, and September 30, 2023, they
produced 141.6 million megawatthours (MWh) of hydropower, 11% below the
year prior, and the smallest amount since 2001. Drought and heat waves
meant less rainfall and rapidly melting snowpack in the Pacific
Northwest. Hydropower in Washington fell by 23% compared to the year
before. California, on the other hand, saw hydropower grow thanks to
repeated atmospheric rivers, but not enough to make up for the overall
regional deficit. The EIA forecasts that western hydropower production
will fall by another 12% this year. <em>The Verge </em>succinctly
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=973bde353f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a>
why a drop in hydropower is bad for the planet: “Drought reduces the
amount of clean energy available from hydroelectric dams. To avoid
energy shortfalls, utilities wind up relying on fossil fuels to make up
the difference. That leads to more of the greenhouse gas emissions
causing climate change, which makes droughts worse.”

<li>Wisconsin utilities pledge to use union labor to build clean energy
infrastructure
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Wisconsin’s major utilities this week announced a
commitment to employing local union workers to build clean energy
projects. The state is embarking on a major renewables expansion,
including new solar installations, onshore wind, and battery storage.
The projects will require about 19,000 construction jobs, and the
biggest power providers in the state – Alliant Energy, Madison Gas &amp;
Electric, WEC Energy Group, and Xcel Energy – say they’ll rely on
workers from five labor unions to fill those roles. The pledge “reflects
the power of the federal Inflation Reduction Act’s tax incentives for
large-scale renewable energy
projects,”<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=5022d5a9c9&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
wrote Karl Ebert at the <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em></a>. “The
IRA provides additional incentives for projects that are built with
union labor or pay the local prevailing wage.”

<h2 id="infinite-mac-turning-to-the-dark-side">Infinite Mac: turning to
the dark side</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>About a year ago I came across the Previous emulator – it appeared to
be a faithful simulation of the NeXT hardware and thus capable of
running NeXTStep. While including it in Infinite Mac would be
scope-creep, NeXT’s legacy is in many ways more relevant to today’s
macOS than classic Mac OS. It also helped that it’s under active
development by its original creator (see the epic thread in the NeXT
Computers forums), and thus a modern, living codebase. Previous is the
fifth emulator that I’ve ported to WebAssembly/Emscripten and the
Infinite Mac runtime, and it’s gotten easier. As I’m doing this work,
I’m developing more and more empathy for those doing Mac game ports –
some things are really easy and others become yak shaves due to the
unintended consequences of choices made by the original developers.
Previous is available on multiple platforms and has good abstractions,
so overall it was a pretty pleasant experience. ↫ Mihai Parparita By
porting previous to WebAssembly/Emscripten, Infinite Mac now offers
access to a whole slew of NeXTSTEP releases, from the earliest known
release to the last one from 1997. There’s also a ton of applications
added to make the experience feel more realistic. This makes Infinite
Mac even more useful than it already was, ensuring it’s one of the best
and easiest ways to experience old macOS and now NeXTSTEP releases
through virtual machines (real ones, this time), available in your
browser. I’ll be spending some time with these new additions for sure,
since I’ve very little experience with NeXTSTEP other than whatever I
vicariously gleamed through Steven Troughton-Smith‘s toots on the
subject over the years. Mihai Parparita is doing incredibly important
work through Infinite Mac, and he deserves credit and praise for all
he’s doing here.</p>

<p>Seven years ago, on 27 March 2017, Apple introduced one of the most
fundamental changes in its operating systems since Mac OS X 10.0 Cheetah
was released 16 years earlier. On that day, those who updated iOS to
version 10.3 had their iPhone’s storage silently converted to the first
release of Apple File System, APFS. Six months later, with the release
of macOS 10.13 High Sierra on 25 September, Mac users followed suit. ↫
Howard Oakley The migration from HFS+ to APFS is still an amazing feat
for Apple to have pulled off. Hundreds of millions devices converted
from one filesystem to another, and barely anyone noticed – no matter
how you look at it, that’s an impressive achievement, and the engineers
who made it possible deserve all the praise they’re getting.</p>

Vulnerability in Saflok’s RFID-Based Keycard Locks</h2>

devastating</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Today, Ian Carroll, Lennert Wouters, and a team of other security
researchers are revealing a hotel keycard hacking technique they call
<a href="https://unsaflok.com/">Unsaflok</a>. The technique is a
collection of security vulnerabilities that would allow a hacker to
almost instantly open several models of Saflok-brand RFID-based keycard
locks sold by the Swiss lock maker Dormakaba. The Saflok systems are
installed on 3 million doors worldwide, inside 13,000 properties in 131
countries. By exploiting weaknesses in both Dormakaba’s encryption and
the underlying RFID system Dormakaba uses, known as MIFARE Classic,
Carroll and Wouters have demonstrated just how easily they can open a
Saflok keycard lock. Their technique starts with obtaining any keycard
from a target hotel—say, by booking a room there or grabbing a keycard
out of a box of used ones—then reading a certain code from that card
with a $300 RFID read-write device, and finally writing two keycards of
their own. When they merely tap those two cards on a lock, the first
rewrites a certain piece of the lock’s data, and the second opens it…

We’re looking after Patches, my brother-in-law’s dog, “for the long
weekend” (until next Tuesday). He hasn’t met Gidget before, and got
himself bapbapbapped when he tried to give her a customary canine
friendly greeting (sniffing her bum). Gidget was FURIOUS! After some
time apart they settled down, though. Patches took a nap, and Gidget
decided beating him up could be deferred in favour of just watching him
like a hawk, and now they’re <em>both</em> snoozing peacefully on the
couch. What a relief 😅

Climate Startup Is Building the World’s Biggest Airplane</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Radia is a $1 billion climate tech startup with an unusual pitch: It is
trying to build the world’s largest airplane. Its proposed aircraft, the
Radia Wind Runner, would be as long as a football field, nearly as wide
as a New York city block, and capable of carrying 12 times the volume of
a Boeing 747. Such a plane could ferry massive wind-turbine blades,
unlocking what the company calls “gigawind” — the ability to build
offshore-sized wind turbines on land.
</p>
<p>
Why is that important? Because the larger the wind turbine, the more
electricity that it generates — and the less wind it needs to work with.
Radia says that its “gigawind” farms could profitably go into places
with slower wind speeds, such as the Northeast or Mississippi Delta.
They could also be built in the existing Wind Belt, potentially doubling
current output.
</p>
<p>
In this week’s episode, Rob and Jesse talk to Radia’s chief executive
officer, Mark Lundstrom. (Jesse’s consulting firm did some research for
Radia while it was in stealth mode, in 2020 and 2023.) We discuss why
the world needs a bigger plane, how such a new aircraft gets licensed,
and why massive wind turbines could be such a big deal for renewable
electricity. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, executive editor of
Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a Princeton professor of energy systems
engineering.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>I’m here in the mechanical and aerospace
engineering department at Princeton, so we’ve got a lot of students
excited about new aerospace applications. I have a six-year-old kid, as
well, and he’s also excited about anything that goes fast and is big, so
I’m sure he’ll get excited about the eventual Lego kit for the
WindRunner that we’ll have to get out in the world. But talk through the
size of this aircraft compared to, say, something we’re used to, like a
737 or more conventional aircraft. <br/> <br/> <strong>Mark Lundstrom:
</strong>Sure. So before understanding the size, one has to understand
the fundamental mission requirements. And so the goal, Radia’s goal is
to be able to move up to a 105 meter long object that could weigh up to
75 tons. Now we can also move multiple smaller blades, so two 95s, or
three 85s, or four 75s. So the vehicle is quite versatile. <br/> <br/>
In terms of sheer size, it’s about 12 times the volume of a 747. So it’s
very, very large compared to the 747. It’s about nine times the volume
of the Antonovs. And yet what’s very different about it — <br/> <br/>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> And the Antonov, that’s the largest plane
built to date, right? <br/> <br/> <strong>Lundstrom:</strong> Yes, the
largest volumetric plane right now. There’s about 14 or 15 of them left
in the world, usually Russian or Ukrainian operated. <br/> <br/>
<strong>Robinson Meyer:</strong> I was going to say, I remember the
biggest plane in the world being destroyed right at the beginning of the
Ukraine War and was wondering how that compared to the to the WindRunner
vehicle. <br/> <br/> <strong>Lundstrom:</strong> So the Antonov 225,
there was one of them. WindRunner is six times bigger in volume than
that airplane was, and it’s nine times bigger in volume than the
remaining Antonov 124s that are still out there. And so, and what’s
additionally unusual about it, in addition to the size, is its ability
to land on dirt. <br/> <br/> <strong>Meyer: </strong>Wow. <br/> <br/>
<strong>Lundstrom:</strong> Things like Antonovs, 747s, etc., they need
to land on about 9,000 feet of steel reinforced concrete, typically. And
we designed the WindRunners so we could land on relatively short dirt
strips, so just over a mile of a semi-prepared field. And that allows us
to bring the payload into a wind farm, and be able to get a very large
aircraft out of the wind farm. It’s probably the first time that an
aircraft has been designed to optimize around volume, as opposed to
mass. <br/> <br/> Usually when an aircraft design team starts off,
they’ll start off thinking about how much mass has to be moved. We
really started off thinking about how much volume has to be moved. So
there are aircraft that move larger mass than the WindRunner. There’s
absolutely no aircraft that comes close to moving larger volumes and
being able to land that volume on a relatively short dirt strip.

<p>Friends, Ronna McDaniel’s tenure at NBC lasted four days. It ended
last night, after network anchors and reporters blasted NBC’s decision

Lottery Streak Ends: Someone Wins $1.12B Mega Millions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DES MOINES, Iowa — Someone in New Jersey overcame the odds Tuesday
night and won the $1.12 billion Mega Millions jackpot, breaking a
winless streak that dated to last December.</p>
<p>The numbers drawn were: 7, 11, 22, 29, 38 and 4. The winning ticket
was sold in New Jersey, according the the Mega Millions website.</p>
<p>Until the latest drawing, no one had matched all six numbers and won
the Mega Millions jackpot since Dec. 8. That amounted to 30 straight
drawings without a big winner.</p>
<p>It’s tough to win the Mega Millions jackpot because the odds are so
long, at 1 in 302.6 million.</p>
<p>The prize is the eighth largest in U.S. lottery history.</p>
<p>The $1.12 billion jackpot is for a winner who is paid through an
annuity, with an initial payment and then 29 annual payments. Most
winners choose a cash payout, which would be $537.5 million.</p>
<p>The next big U.S. lottery drawing will be Wednesday night for an
estimated $865 million Powerball jackpot. No one has won that prize
since New Year’s Day, making for 36 drawings without a winner.</p>
<p>Mega Millions is played in 45 states plus Washington, D.C., and the
U.S. Virgin Islands. Powerball also is played in those states as well as
Washington, D.C., the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.</p>

id="top-us-officials-warn-israels-gallant-against-invading-rafah">Top US
Officials Warn Israel’s Gallant Against Invading Rafah</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Top Biden administration officials urged Israeli Defense
Minister Yoav Gallant to abandon plans to invade the southern Gaza city
of Rafah, where more than 1.4 million Palestinian civilians seek safety,
as U.S.-Israel tensions brew over Israel’s conduct in its six-month-old
war against Hamas.</p>
<p>In meetings Monday and Tuesday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and
Secretary of State Antony Blinken reaffirmed U.S. support for Israel’s
right to defend itself while reiterating opposition to Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu’s planned ground offensive to target Hamas in Gaza’s
southernmost city on the border with Egypt.</p>
<p>“Our goal [is] to help Israel find an alternative to a full-scale and
perhaps premature military operation that could endanger the over 1
million civilians that are sheltering in Rafah,” a senior U.S. defense
official told reporters Tuesday, briefing on the condition of anonymity
under ground rules set by the Pentagon.</p>
<p>A major ground operation in Rafah would further jeopardize the
welfare of Palestinian civilians, State Department spokesperson Matthew
Miller said on Monday. He added that Blinken underscored to Gallant that
“alternatives exist” that would both better ensure Israel’s security and
protect Palestinian civilians.</p>
<p>Amid a looming famine in Gaza, Austin warned of the “humanitarian
catastrophe” in the Palestinian enclave, describing civilian casualties
as “far too high” and aid deliveries as “far too low.” His remarks
echoed Blinken’s calls for Israel “to immediately surge and sustain”
more aid.</p>
<p>The Netanyahu government has denied accusations by international aid
agencies and the United Nations that Israel is blocking aid and
provoking famine in Gaza as part of its strategy to root out Hamas.</p>
<p>Similar admonitions were likely being conveyed by White House
national security adviser Jake Sullivan. In a sign of potentially
complicated talks, Sullivan’s meeting with Gallant, originally scheduled
for Monday, was extended an extra day.</p>
<p>“They believed it was important to continue the conversation,” said
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.</p>
<p>Sullivan told reporters last week that President Joe Biden himself
had warned Netanyahu an invasion in Rafah would be a mistake and urged
him to have a “coherent and sustainable strategy” to defeat Hamas.</p>
<p>‘Don’t do it’</p>
<p>Netanyahu insists that the goal of “total victory” against Hamas
cannot be achieved without going into Rafah, where Israel says there are
four Hamas battalions composed of thousands of fighters.</p>
<p>Initially, the Biden administration said they would not support a
Rafah offensive without sufficient protection of civilians.</p>
<p>Now, they’re telling Israel, “Don’t do it,” said Aaron David Miller,
senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and
former U.S. negotiator in Middle East peace talks.</p>
<p>“It’s not now a question of making sure that the population is
somehow safeguarded,” he told VOA. “They just don’t want the Israelis to
do it.”</p>
<p>Despite the pressure piled on Gallant this week, the decision on
Rafah would have to be taken by the Israeli War Cabinet, whose members
in addition to Gallant include Netanyahu and Benny Gantz, former
minister of defense and deputy prime minister, as well as two observers
— opposition politician Gadi Eisenkot and Ron Dermer, Netanyahu’s close
adviser.</p>
<p>Gallant’s meetings have been the main high-level consultation
mechanism between the U.S. and its ally, as Netanyahu abruptly canceled
plans for a visit by a separate Israeli delegation.</p>
<p>That was done in protest of Washington’s abstention at the U.N. that
allowed the adoption of a Security Council resolution demanding an
immediate cease-fire in Gaza and the release of hostages held by
Hamas.</p>
<p>Netanyahu accused the U.S. of shifting from its prior position of
conditioning the cease-fire call on the release of hostages, which the
administration denies.</p>
<p>More weapons</p>
<p>Gallant, a security hawk who supports a ground operation in Rafah,
had aimed to use his Washington visit to ramp up the transfer of
American weapons. In remarks ahead of his meeting with Austin, he said
he wants to “ensure Israel’s military edge and capabilities.”</p>
<p>Israel needs U.S. arms not only for the campaign in Gaza but also to
prepare for further escalation in the north of the country with
Hezbollah in Lebanon, said Brian Finucane, senior adviser for the U.S.
Program at the International Crisis Group. Since the Oct. 7 Hamas
attacks, the two sides have exchanged fire through thousands of rocket
and missile launches.</p>
<p>“The U.S. has real leverage here,” Finucane told VOA. “The best-case
scenario would be if the U.S. actually did use its abundant leverage,
both unilaterally and multilaterally, to try to bring about a
cease-fire.”</p>
<p>While Biden has begun using his diplomatic leverage by abstaining at
the U.N., he is unlikely to condition or restrict military aid to Israel
as he aims to keep the conflict from spreading.</p>
<p>“The last thing he should want to do is to send an unmistakable
signal to Hezbollah and Iran that we’re not prepared to back the
Israelis, if, in fact, there is an escalation in the Israeli northern
border,” said Miller.</p>
<p>The most fundamental goal for Biden right now, he said, is reaching a
deal in the cease-fire negotiations in Qatar. Hamas says it will release
hostages only as part of a deal that would end the war, while Israel
says it will discuss only a temporary pause.</p>
<p>US arms for Israel</p>
<p>The U.S. has committed to provide Israel with nearly $4 billion a
year in aid through 2028, most of it in the form of military assistance.
Approximately $3.3 billion per year is given under the Foreign Military
Financing program, funds that Israel must use to purchase U.S. military
equipment and services.</p>
<p>Since the Gaza war began, the administration has quietly delivered
more than 100 separate foreign military sales to Israel. The arms
transfers were processed without public debate because the
administration broke up the sales packages in amounts below the
threshold that requires them to notify Congress, according to a defense
official who spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity to discuss a
sensitive military matter.</p>
<p>Under pressure from Democratic lawmakers, last month the White House
released a National Security Memorandum requiring the U.S. secretary of
state to “obtain credible and reliable written assurances” from foreign
governments that U.S. weapons are used in accordance with international
and humanitarian law.</p>
<p>Gallant delivered Israel’s required written assurances ahead of the
deadline on Sunday. Under the memorandum, the State Department has until
early May to formally assess and report to Congress whether those
assurances are “credible and reliable.” Without it, Biden has the option
of suspending further U.S. arms transfers.</p>
<p>So far, Biden has not indicated any willingness to do so. In his call
with Netanyahu last week, the president “didn’t make threats,” Sullivan
said. “Each of them recognizes that we are at a critical moment in this
conflict.”</p>

<h2 id="plasma-5-the-early-years">Plasma 5: the early years</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>With KDE’s 6th Mega Release finally out the door, let’s reflect on
the outgoing Plasma 5 that has served us well over the years. Can you
believe it has been almost ten years since Plasma 5.0 was released? Join
me on a trip down memory lane and let me tell you how it all began. This
coincidentally continues pretty much where my previous retrospective
blog post concluded. ↫ Kai Uwe It took them a few years after the
release of Plasma 5.0, but eventually they won me over, and I’m now
solid in the KDE camp, after well over a decade of either GNOME or
Cinnamon. GNOME has strayed far too much away from just being a
traditional desktop user interface, and Cinnamon is dragging its heels
with Wayland support, but luckily KDE has spent a long time now clearing
up so many of the paper cuts that used to plague them every time I tried
KDE. That’s all in the past now. They’ve done a solid job cleaning up a
lot of the oddities and inconsistencies during Plasma 5’s lifecycle, and
I can’t wait until Fedora 40 hits the streets with Plasma 6 in tow. In
the desktop Linux world, I feel KDE and Qt will always play a little bit
of second fiddle to the (seemingly) much more popular GNOME and GTK+,
but that’s okay – this kind of diversity and friendly competition is
what makes each of these desktops better for their respective users. And
this is the Linux world, after all – you’re not tied down to anything
your current desktop environment does, and you’re free to switch to
whatever else at a moment’s notice if some new update doesn’t sit well
with you. I can’t imagine using something like macOS or Windows where
you have to just accept whatever garbage they throw at you with nowhere
to go.</p>

expands Long Term Support to 12 years starting with Ubuntu 14.04
LTS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today, Canonical announced the general availability of Legacy
Support, an Ubuntu Pro add-on that expands security and support coverage
for Ubuntu LTS releases to 12 years. The add-on will be available for
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS onwards.  Long term supported Ubuntu releases get five
years of standard security maintenance on the main Ubuntu repository.
Ubuntu Pro expands that commitment to 10 years on both the main and
universe repositories, providing enterprises and end users alike access
to a vast secure open source software library. The subscription also
comes with a phone and ticket support tier. Ubuntu Pro paying customers
can purchase an extra two years of security maintenance and support with
the new Legacy Support add-on. ↫ Canonical blog Assuming all of this
respects the open source licenses of the countless software packages
that make up Ubuntu, this seems like a reasonable way to offer quite a
long support lifecycle for those that really need it. Such support
doesn’t come free, and it I think it’s entirely reasonable to try and
get compensated for the work required in maintaining that level of
support for 10 or 12 years. If you want this kind of longevity from your
Linux installation without paying for it, you’ll have to maintain it
yourself. Seems reasonable to me.</p>

Aims to Tap Domestic Lithium Supply Without Chinese Products</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Energy
announced a record conditional loan of $2.26 billion to tap the largest
known lithium reserves in North America. The loan is an important step
in an effort by the U.S. government to reduce reliance on China for the
metal used to make batteries.</p>
<p>Analysts, however, say that it may be too late to move away from
reliance on China completely when it comes to metal processing and the
production of batteries.</p>
<p>The DOE’s Loan Programs Office (LPO) says the funds, if approved
after review, will help the Lithium Americas Corp. construct a lithium
carbonate processing plant at the Thacker Pass mine project in Humboldt
County, Nevada.</p>
<p>The LPO says the project would help “secure reliable, sustainable
domestic supply chains for critical materials, which are key to reaching
our ambitious clean energy and climate goals and reducing our reliance
on economic competitors like China.”</p>
<p>Lithium Americas Corp. on its official website says battery materials
could be “completely sourced and manufactured in the U.S., bringing down
the overall carbon footprint, transport costs and supply chain
risks.”</p>
<p>The LPO says lithium carbonate from Thacker Pass could eventually
support the production of batteries “for up to 800,000 electric vehicles
(EVs) per year, saving 317 million gallons of gasoline per year.”</p>
<p>Although the U.S. has made pioneering and groundbreaking
contributions to the development of the lithium ion battery, industry
experts say lithium processing and EV battery production is dominated
today by China.</p>
<p>“Parts of our key supply chains, including for clean energy, are
currently over concentrated in China,” said U.S. Treasury Secretary
Janet Yellen in prepared remarks March 2 when she visited a U.S. lithium
processing facility in Chile, which holds the world’s largest reserves
of the metal.</p>
<p>“This makes America more vulnerable to shocks in China, or whatever
country dominates production, from natural disasters to macroeconomic
forces, to deliberate actions such as economic coercion.”</p>
<p>A report last year by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development said China increased restrictions on its exports of critical
minerals ninefold between 2009 and 2020.</p>
<p>Data from the U.S. Geological Survey shows the output and scale of
lithium mines in Australia and Argentina far exceed China’s. In 2022,
Australia’s lithium mine output was more than three times China’s.</p>
<p>Refining, processing still issues</p>
<p>But industry experts say while Western countries have poured a lot of
investment into developing raw minerals, they have paid little attention
to refining and processing, areas in which China dominates.</p>
<p>Ellen R. Wald, a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council
Global Energy Center, tells VOA, “Lithium is not useful just as it is.
You have to refine it to make what’s used in the batteries. And that’s
really where China controls the supply chain because almost all of the
refining for lithium that creates it into the substance that can be used
to make batteries is done in China.”</p>
<p>According to the Chatham House, Chinese companies accounted for about
72% of global lithium refining capacity in 2022.</p>
<p>China also dominates much of the global market for battery-related
equipment, leaving limited options for U.S. companies that want to
showcase their domestic production credentials.</p>
<p>American Battery Factory Inc., or ABF, is an emerging battery
manufacturer that says it is “the first network of entirely U.S.-owned
vertical manufacturing, supply chain and R&amp;D for Lithium Iron
Phosphate battery cells in the United States.”</p>
<p>But to secure custom automation equipment and machinery for use in
its first large-scale rechargeable battery factory in Tucson, Arizona,
it has formed a partnership with Lead Intelligent Equipment, a Chinese
company.</p>
<p>Dependent on China</p>
<p>In an article in January, Wald said China is in a good position to
restrict access to lithium-ion batteries to certain countries or
companies as it wishes, and if the U.S. military suddenly finds itself
in need of more specialized batteries, the Pentagon may not be able to
obtain them.</p>
<p>In February 2022, China announced sanctions against Lockheed Martin,
the manufacturer of the F-35 fighter jet, and Raytheon Technologies, the
world’s largest missile manufacturer. Although China did not specify the
details of the sanctions, it is generally considered to be a possible
threat to cut off the Western countries’ supply of critical
minerals.</p>
<p>Wald told VOA, “The U.S. defense industry is basically dependent on
China for these specialized batteries that they need in all of their
drones and their surveillance systems and all sorts of things.”</p>
<p>David Whittle, adjunct professor in resource engineering at the
Department of Civil Engineering at Monash University in Australia, told
VOA even if “the world develops a robust, independent supply chain for
lithium, up to the point of battery chemical production, at present,
China would still be the largest customer for those chemicals, since it
is the largest cell manufacturer, the largest battery pack manufacturer,
the largest E.V. manufacturer and the largest market for E.V.s.”</p>
<p>The Thacker Pass lithium mine is located at the southern end of the
McDermitt Caldera, and is considered to be one of the largest in the
world.</p>
<p>The record loan to Lithium Americas Corp. is the largest such loan
the U.S. has offered for the development of a lithium mine project since
the country stepped up its efforts to build a domestic supply chain for
critical minerals in recent years.</p>
<p>The Thacker Pass lithium project is not expected to start production
until 2028, and even then, Wald said, that goal may be too ambitious.
The mine plans to extract lithium from clay, but Wald says it has never
been mined in this way on a commercial scale. In addition, the mine is
in a remote and sparsely populated location, requiring the company to
build housing for workers and their families and to reassess its
environmental impact.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, Wald said creating a secure supply chain is
not impossible for the U.S.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s too late,” Wald said. “Will they be able to
compete with China globally? Probably not. But can we create non-Chinese
sustainable and secure supply chains? Yeah, we can do it.”</p>
<p>Whittle said Western countries being “resilient to challenges from
China” can’t mean “isolated from China” anymore, but resilience is still
possible.</p>
<p>The DOE’s LPO said while their announcement shows intent to give the
loan, the company must first satisfy certain technical, legal,
environmental and financial conditions before the funds will be
released.</p>

Slam Apple CEO Tim Cook for Laudatory Remarks in China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Tim Cook, CEO of the American technology giant Apple, is
facing criticism at home over laudatory remarks he made about China
during a recent visit to try to boost sagging iPhone sales in the
lucrative market. </p>
<p>Cook was in Shanghai for the opening of China’s largest Apple retail
store on Friday and met with Chinese political and business people. He
praised China for being “so vibrant and so dynamic,” in remarks widely
quoted by state media and Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua
Chunying. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The new Apple store took seven years and cost over 80 million yuan
(roughly $11.1 million) to build. It is said to be the second largest in
the world and the largest in Asia, and it is staffed by about 150
people. </p>
<p>Thursday evening, at least 12 hours before the scheduled opening, a
long line had formed in front of the store. Some media said the crowds
were “as bustling as New Year’s Eve.” </p>
<p>In addition to showing their loyalty to the brand by purchasing Apple
products, the opening day crowds rushed to take photos with Cook, who
was in the store at the event.</p>
<p>Dan Ives, a technology analyst on Wall Street, said on X, formerly
Twitter, that Cook’s trip to China shows that Apple will continue to
attach importance to the Chinese market.</p>
<p>“Apple is actually increasing its investments and retail footprint in
China the past year,” he said, “and to this point Cook has been in China
since last week on an important visit to lay the groundwork on Apple’s
future in China. Cook reaffirming China strategy.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chinese media reported on Monday that Apple will cooperate with
Chinese technology company Baidu to provide artificial intelligence
capabilities to the iPhones sold in China this year. Baidu has not
verified the report. </p>
<p>However, not all Chinese love Apple. A viral video clip on Chinese
social media shows a middle-aged Chinese woman in yellow clothes, a
baseball cap and a mask yelling at the people who queued up at the new
Apple store the night before its opening, “You worship and favor foreign
things.”  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She also said Apple’s business expansion in China is “because of scum
like you who are willing to pay for it.” </p>
<p>A person in the line said, “Do you know how many jobs Apple brings to
China every year?”  </p>
<p>The woman replied, “No need, we have our own Huawei!” </p>
<p>The drama reflects the challenges Apple is facing in China. IPhone
shipments in China fell about 33% in February from a year earlier,
according to official data, marking a second consecutive month of lower
shipments. </p>
<p>In January, the company shipped a total of roughly 5.5 million units,
or about 39% fewer handsets than in the prior year, according to China
Academy of Information and Communications Technology figures. </p>
<p>Frank Lee, a senior partner of Blue Ocean Capital in Beijing, said
that most Chinese iPhone users have a good experience with Apple
products, so they remain loyal to the brand. However, there is a clear
trend of declining sales of Apple products due to competition with
Chinese domestic brands. </p>
<p>Lee told VOA, “I think Apple’s opening of a store in Shanghai will
play a certain role in [boosting] its sales in China, but it cannot
fundamentally reverse the overall slow decline trend of iPhones in
China.” </p>
<p>However, Cook expressed his confidence in the Chinese market. He told
the Chinese media, “I love the people and the culture [of China]. Every
time I come here, I’m reminded that anything is possible here.” </p>
<p>Cook’s remarks have been criticized as glorifying the Chinese
government’s arrogant treatment of private enterprises. </p>
<p>Jonathan Eyal, associate director of the Royal United Services
Institute for Defense and Security Studies in the U.K., wrote on X,
“‘Everything is possible’ in China, says Apple’s Tim Cook. Including
being arrested and expropriated. And losing the market at a stroke of a
bureaucratic pen.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Theresa Fallon, director at the Centre for Russia Europe Asia
Studies, wrote, “Apple chief Tim Cook’s obsequious praise for China …
unlikely to reverse the tide and CCP mandates that government officials
can’t use Apple phones.”  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bloomberg reported last year that a growing number of Chinese
government agencies and state-owned enterprises were ordering employees
not to bring iPhones and other foreign-brand phones to the workplace.
China’s Foreign Ministry did not confirm the report. </p>
<p>Some observers believe Cook’s remarks were not sincere. In recent
years, Apple has expanded its production in India. Last year, iPhones
made in India appeared for the first time in the first batch of iPhone
15 models released globally. </p>
<p>However, others say China is irreplaceable to the global supply
chain. They noted that Apple has faced challenges in efficiency since
its supplier Foxconn moved production lines to India in the past couple
of years. </p>
<p>Noah Smith, an American current affairs columnist, wrote, “LOLLLLLLL
meanwhile he’s shifting production out of China as fast as he can.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some critics of Cook are more serious. Sophie Richardson, former
China director at Human Rights Watch, said, “.@tim_cook, about
those”vibrant” and “dynamic” #crimesagainsthumanity committed by your
#China govt hosts…?“  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Eli Friedman, associate professor of global labor and work at Cornell
University, said the past mutually beneficial relationship between
Beijing and American companies is no longer playing a diplomatic
role. </p>
<p>He wrote, “Throwing Apple some treats will not help stabilize the
U.S.-China relationship, I promise.” </p>

Billion Mega Millions Drawing Nears, Followed by $865 Million Powerball
Prize</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DES MOINES, Iowa — Another day, another giant lottery jackpot. </p>
<p>Next up is an estimated $1.12 billion Mega Millions prize on Tuesday
night, enticing players who hope to win the eighth-largest prize in U.S.
lottery history even though no one has won the jackpot since December 8,
2023. That is 30 consecutive drawings without a jackpot winner.</p>
<p>Miss out on that drawing? No problem. There will be a drawing
Wednesday night for an estimated $865 million Powerball jackpot. No one
has won that prize either since New Year’s Day, making for 36 drawings
without a winner. </p>
<p>For both games, the long drought of jackpots is no accident. The
games have long odds specifically to create large jackpots that will
generate lots of interest and sales. </p>
<p>For Mega Millions, the odds are 1 in 302.6 million, and for Powerball
they are 1 in 292.2 million. </p>
<p>The $1.12 billion Mega Millions prize is for a sole winner who
chooses to be paid through an annuity over 30 years. A winner who opts
for a cash payout would get $537.5 million. </p>
<p>Those winnings would be subject to federal taxes, and some states
also tax lottery winnings. </p>
<p>Mega Millions is played in 45 states plus Washington, D.C., and the
U.S. Virgin Islands. Powerball also is played in those states as well as
Washington, D.C., the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.</p>

<p>COLUMBIA, MISSOURI — U.S. President Joe Biden has won Missouri’s
primary, the state Democratic Party announced. </p>
<p>Biden’s win was not in doubt; he has already beaten his major
competitors. But the primary races are still closely watched by insiders
for turnout and signs of protest voters. </p>
<p>Saturday’s primary was the Missouri Democratic Party’s first
party-run presidential contest since a new law took effect in August
2022. </p>
<p>The party says about 20,000 voters participated. </p>
<p>Missouri Republicans opted to hold a caucus this year, which former
President Donald Trump won. </p>
<p>Lawmakers have failed to reinstate the state-run primary despite
calls to do so by both state Republican and Democratic party
leaders.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Republicans in Washington do not have a great track record executing
themed policy weeks. Consider the Trump administration’s original 2017
Infrastructure Week, which had the misfortune of
<a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/trump-health-care-policy-energy-week/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">coinciding</a>
with former FBI Director James Comey’s live testimony before the Senate
Intelligence Committee. Or take the Infrastructure Week scheduled a few
months after that, which Trump famously

by blaming “both sides” for the white supremacist-initiated violence in
Charlottesville. Or take the Infrastructure Week
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/us/politics/coronavirus-infrastructure-week-timeline.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">after
<em>that</em> one</a>, when — well, you get it.

Past attempts at holding an Energy Week haven’t fared much better, and
unless you’re an incredibly close reader of procedural political news,
it’s possible you missed that last week was an Energy Week, too.

On the surface, Energy Week 2024 didn’t offer much worth paying
attention to, which could also explain the absence of headlines. The
House used the occasion to vote on four energy-related bills that have
no chance of surviving in the Democrat-controlled Senate: H.R. 1023
(passed 209-204), which would repeal the Inflation Reduction Act’s $27
billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund; H.R. 1121 (passed 229-188, with
15 Democratic
“<a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202493" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">yeas</a>”),
which prevents the president from imposing a moratorium on fracking
without the authorization of Congress; H.R. 6009 (passed 216-200), a
Lauren Boebert-sponsored bill that would block the Interior’s update of
oil and gas leasing regulations; and H.R.7023 (passed 213-205), which
chips away at Clean Water Act rules. The House also passed two
non-binding resolutions, one that “denounces the harmful, anti-American
energy policies of the Biden administration” and another that condemns

<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/carbon-tax-2025" target="_self">carbon
tax</a>, which saw 10
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/epa-rules-biden" target="_self">vulnerable
Democrats</a> join Republicans voting in favor of it.
</p>
<p>
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called these efforts
“<a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&v=931401285439407" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bogus
and nasty</a>,” so it seems pretty clear these bills are destined to die
somewhere between the House and Senate chambers, and the left mostly
laughed them off. California Democratic Representative Scott Peters
<a href="https://scottpeters.house.gov/2024/3/rep-peters-calls-out-house-gop-energy-week-as-political-theatre" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">slammed</a>
Energy Week as an “unserious messaging exercise.” The Environmental
Defense Fund called the week a
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/green-groups-plot-counterattack-for-gop-energy-week/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">waste</a>.
Longtime Hill commentator Jamie Dupree treated the affair to an eye roll
<a href="https://jamiedupree.substack.com/p/energy-week-features-bills-already" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in
his Substack</a>, noting that three of the bills voted on last week —
H.R. 1121, H.R. 1023, and H.R. 1141 — were <em>already approved </em>by
the House as part of the Lower Energy Costs Act (H.R. 1) last spring.
</p>
<p>
House Republican Leader Steve Scalise seemed to acknowledge this overlap
in a recent
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/qa-scalise-talks-ira-repeal-evs-and-hopes-for-trump/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview
with <em>E&amp;E News</em></a>, complaining that H.R. 1 has languished
in the Senate “for about a year now” — though, as Dupree points out, the
bill
<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1/all-actions?s=1&r=1&q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22HR1%22%7D" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">never
actually got sent</a> by the House to the upper chamber, a delay for
which “I can’t get any Republicans on Capitol Hill to give me a straight
answer,” Dupree wrote.
</p>
<p>
In other words, Energy Week appears to be a classic case of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/esg-hearing-congress-oversight-weird" target="_self">political
theater</a>. But that doesn’t mean it was all meaningless. It’s always
worth asking who, exactly, is all the song and dance for?
</p>
<p>
It may not have been another unfortunate policy-week coincidence that
Energy Week lined up perfectly with CERAWeek, the energy summit held in
Houston, where the head of Saudi Aramco called the phase-out of oil and
gas a
“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/19/climate/ceraweek-saudi-fantasy-energy-transition.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fantasy</a>.”
<a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/energy-policy/2024/03/18/what-to-watch-during-energy-week" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">What
was not included</a> on the Energy Week slate is also revealing — for
instance, Washington Republican Cathy McMorris Rodgers’ hydropower
permitting bill. Perhaps it was excluded because it would have
represented an
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/permitting-reform-transmission-nepa-geothermal" target="_self">actual
attempt at policy-making</a>, which is not what Energy Week was all
about?
</p>
<p>
Danielle Butcher Franz, the CEO of the American Conservation Coalition’s
Action Fund, told me in an emailed statement that she thinks
“Congressional Republicans were right to celebrate American energy and
push for domestic energy production” last week. But she also expressed
disappointment over the party missing a “critical opportunity to
demonstrate that American energy is clean energy,” and called the
dismissal of climate change by some of the Republican members
“frustrating and unproductive.” Butcher Franz added, for example, that
expanding nuclear energy, building more energy projects, and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/chinese-ev-cars-biden" target="_self">beating
China</a> could have been “conservative approaches” to lowering
emissions that nevertheless were absent from the slate of energy bills.
</p>
<p>
Energy Week wasn’t entirely pointless as a policymaking exercise,
though. Sure, it was largely a wink to
<a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2023/10/12/speaker-scalise-oil-industry-says-yes-please-00121197" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">donors</a>,
but it also marked a show of alignment on priorities at a time when
<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/mike-johnson-gop-house-implosion" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Republicans’
ability to get things done</a> could reasonably make fossil fuel
interests nervous. That Energy Week’s bills also align with the goals of
the Heritage Foundation-authored
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self">playbook
for a Republican presidency</a> is further reassurance that the party is
pursuing policies aimed at reducing barriers to new leasing and drilling
rather than repeating
<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/23/oil-gas-execs-unhappy-biden-trump-00148597" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
chaos</a> of the previous administration. It’s organized. It’s
intentional. It’s setting the stage.
</p>
<p>
Of course, none of this will matter if Democrats and
<a href="https://www.brianfitzpatrick.com/issues/protecting-our-environment/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">climate-moderate
Republicans</a> win elections this year. But if that <em>doesn’t</em>
happen, well — we might end up looking back at Energy Week and wondering
how we ever missed it.

Faces Gag Order in New York Hush Money Criminal Case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Donald Trump on Tuesday was hit with a judge’s gag order
sought by prosecutors in his upcoming criminal trial involving hush
money paid to a porn star, restricting him from publicly commenting
about witnesses and court staff. </p>
<p>Ahead of the former U.S. president’s trial, which is scheduled to
begin April 15 in the New York state court, Justice Juan Merchan granted
a request for the order made last month by Manhattan District Attorney
Alvin Bragg’s office. </p>
<p>The prosecution sought an order blocking Trump from “making or
directing others to make” statements about witnesses concerning their
role in the case and from commenting on court staff and prosecutors
other than Bragg himself. </p>
<p>Silencing Trump was necessary because of his “longstanding history of
attacking witnesses, investigators, prosecutors, judges and others
involved in legal proceedings against him,” prosecutors said.  </p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers argued that a gag order would violate his right to
free speech under the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment, leaving him
defenseless against attacks by political opponents over the case. </p>
<p>Merchan separately ruled on March 7 that jurors were to remain
anonymous except to Trump, his lawyers, prosecutors and a handful of
others, after prosecutors highlighted Trump’s history of publicly
deriding trial jurors and grand jurors. </p>
<p>Bragg’s case is one of four criminal indictments the Republican
presidential candidate faces, with Trump pleading not guilty in all the
cases and portraying them as politically motivated. </p>
<p>It could be the only case to reach trial before his expected Nov. 5
rematch with President Joe Biden. </p>
<p>Trump pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business
records to hide reimbursements to his former lawyer Michael Cohen for a
$130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels to buy her silence before
the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she claimed to have had with
Trump a decade earlier. </p>
<p>Trump has denied having the encounter with Daniels, whose real name
is Stephanie Clifford.  </p>
<p>The requested gag order was similar to restrictions a federal judge
imposed last year in a criminal case over Trump’s efforts to overturn
his 2020 election loss to Biden. </p>
<p>Trump also faces state criminal charges in Georgia over his push to
reverse the 2020 results, and federal criminal charges in Florida over
his handling of sensitive government documents after leaving the White
House in 2021.  </p>
<p>In a separate civil fraud case brought by New York Attorney General
Letitia James, another New York state judge fined Trump $15,000 last
year for twice violating a gag order against publicly talking about
court staff.  </p>
<p>Trump is appealing a $454.2 million judgment in that case for
misstating the values of his family real estate company’s properties to
dupe lenders. On March 25, a midlevel state appeals court paused that
judgment as long as Trump posts a smaller $175 million bond within 10
days.</p>

Baltimore Bridge Collapse Is Throwing the U.S. Coal Market for a
Loop</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-26, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p>
The Port of Baltimore — currently closed to container traffic thanks to
the
<a href="https://www.wbaltv.com/article/baltimore-bridge-collapse-key-bridge/60303975" target="_blank">collapse
of the Francis Scott Key Bridge</a> early Tuesday morning — plays a
pivotal role in the energy trade, but not for anything that the Biden
administration would like to talk about. It’s not some major nexus for
clean energy components (although many cars go in and out of it), or
even the liquefied natural gas that the U.S. proudly ships to Europe
(that’s about 80 miles south at the Cove Point in Lusby, Maryland).
</p>
<p>
Instead, what’s flowing through Baltimore is coal.
</p>
<p>
The Port of Baltimore is the second largest coal export facility in the
U.S. About 20% of U.S. the country’s coal exports ran through the port
in 2022,
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=MD" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to the Energy Information Administration</a>. In the first nine months
of 2023, the most recent period for which data is available, about 20
million short tons of coal traveled through the port, a
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/coal/production/quarterly/pdf/t13p01p1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">20%
jump</a> from the same period in 2022. (At the Port of Virginia, about
150 nautical miles to the south, that figure was 26 million short tons,
up just 6% from the beginning of 2022.)
</p>
<p>
U.S. coal
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/coal/production/quarterly/pdf/qcr-all.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">largely
went to Europe and Asia</a>, with big jumps in exports to Indonesia and
Vietnam. The biggest recipients of U.S. coal are India, South Korea,
China, and the Netherlands, where coal is shipped for transport across
Europe.
</p>
<p>
The projected block up of coal exports could last more than a month, one
coal shipping executive
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-26/baltimore-bridge-collapse-will-likely-block-coal-exports-for-weeks?utm_content=asia&utm_source=twitter&cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-asia&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_medium=social" target="_blank">told
</a><em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-26/baltimore-bridge-collapse-will-likely-block-coal-exports-for-weeks?utm_content=asia&utm_source=twitter&cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-asia&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_medium=social">Bloomberg</a></em>.
While it’s still unknown exactly how long the port will be closed to
container traffic, the effect of the collapse is already visible in the
stock prices of coal companies that use the port.
</p>
<p>
Shares of Consol Energy, for instance, which ships more than 10 million
tons of coal annually through a terminal at the Port of Baltimore, are
down 7% for the day. Consol’s coal comes from mines in southeastern
Pennsylvania and southern West Virginia, where it’s then shipped by rail
to Baltimore. Shares of one rail company that services the terminal,
Norfolk Southern, dipped in early trading Tuesday but were flat Tuesday
afternoon, while shares in CSX, the other rail company that serves
Consol’s terminal, were down 2%.<br/><br/>“We do not have a definitive
timeline of when vessel access or normal operations will resume,” Consol
<a href="https://investors.consolenergy.com/2024-03-26-CONSOL-Energy-Issues-Notice-on-Francis-Scott-Key-Bridge-Collapse-in-Baltimore,-MD" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said
in a statement Tuesday</a>. “We are looking at all available options to
us to minimize or address direct and indirect impacts to the Company and
its operations.”
</p>
<p>
In terms of its effects on the overall energy market, the port’s
indefinite closure could be mild and may actually result in lower energy
prices in the Northeast, as coal that would have been exported becomes,
essentially, stranded stateside, Greg Brew, an analyst at the Eurasia
Group, told me. But even this effect may be muted, Brew explained,
because the weather is warming up with the end of winter, meaning
there’s less demand on natural gas for heating.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>“That can’t be too affected by more cheap coal sitting
around,” Brew said.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>The port is also a major throughway for imports and exports
of cars, with around 750,000 cars
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-ford-will-reroute-baltimore-shipments-after-bridge-collapse-2024-03-26/" target="_blank">going

Sanctions Assad Supporters Over Drug Trafficking</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned 11 people and
companies on Tuesday it said were involved in illicit financial
transfers and drug smuggling in support of the government of Syrian
president Bashar al-Assad. </p>
<p>Many of those sanctioned were involved in the trade of the highly
addictive amphetamine captagon, which is illegally trafficked throughout
the Middle East and Europe, the Treasury Department said in a
statement.  </p>
<p>Syria has become the world’s leading producer of the powerful drug,
and its trade has helped bolster the Assad’s government’s coffers during
the country’s long-running civil war. </p>
<p>“The revenue from the illicit Captagon trade has become a major
source of income for the Assad regime, the Syrian armed forces, and
Syrian paramilitary forces,” the Treasury Department said in a
statement.  </p>
<p>Those sanctioned include a Syrian national called Taher al-Kayali,
who allegedly operates a company that purchased vessels to smuggle
captagon and hashish.  </p>
<p>Maya Exchange Company, another Syria-based firm, is alleged to have
facilitated “millions” of dollars of illicit transactions to benefit the
Syrian government.  </p>
<p>“The Assad regime continues to employ a variety of schemes to evade
sanctions and sustain its longstanding campaign of repression against
its own citizens,” Treasury under secretary for terrorism and financial
intelligence Brian Nelson said in a statement.  </p>
<p>This includes “trafficking in illegal drugs, exploiting currency
exchanges, and leveraging seemingly legitimate businesses,” he
continued. </p>
<p>“The United States remains committed to holding accountable those who
seek to support this illicit financial activity at the expense of the
Syrian people,” he added.</p>

data science space. It is easy to understand why — it seems to be
ubiquitous, present everywhere, it’s human-readable, it’s less verbose

import adventures</a>, I was left with a shipping container in my yard.
These engineering wonders are great for many uses outside of merely
transferring goods around the world, with one of the most common
secondary uses being watertight storage units. That seemed like a great
idea to put to use for all of my electric “toys”. Between my electric
bikes, e-motorcycles, e-ATVs, electric tractors, and a few other things
I’m probably forgetting, having a weather-sealed, solar-powered off-grid
charging shed would be a big benefit. And if I could add an
air-conditioning unit to keep the machines from baking in the sun (and
function as a dehumidifier at the same time), then all the better. As it
turned out, the project was a lot easier than I expected. Here’s how I
did it.

calculated that natural disasters resulted in insured losses of $108
billion in 2023, marking the fourth consecutive year of losses exceeding
$100 billion. As <em>Bloomberg</em>

“only about 40% of economic losses globally are insured, meaning the
total economic losses are much higher.”<br/> <br/> The main reason
losses were so high was the sheer frequency with which “medium severity”
disasters occurred. These are events that cost between $1 billion and $5
billion, and they’re on the rise. Severe thunderstorms (also called
severe convective storms, or SCS) have become “the second largest
loss-making peril” behind tropical cyclones. The Midwest accounted for
the highest percentage of insured losses from severe thunderstorms in
the U.S. last year:

published in the journal <em>Sustainable Cities and Society</em>. The
research is the first demonstration of how paints made to reflect the
sun’s heat actually perform in the real world. For the study,
researchers at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University covered
surfaces such as walls, rooftops, and pavements in an industrial
neighborhood in Singapore. They found those surfaces were up to 2
degrees Celsius cooler than uncoated areas during the hottest time of
the day, and that this helped pedestrians feel 1.5 degrees cooler. “This
is a minimally intrusive solution for urban cooling that has an
immediate effect,”

<p>date: 2024-03-26, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/26/maddow.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I
don’t usually watch Maddow on Monday nights. I lost my faith in her when
she went after Facebook a few years ago, not that Facebook didn’t
deserve her attention, but her arguments while condemning them were
exaggerated. I knew the facts, she left out important details.
</p>
<p>
She steered viewers into believing things that weren’t true. Didn’t
exactly lie, but pretty close. I figured if she does that for stories I
know, then she’s probably doing it other times when I wasn’t so well
informed.
</p>
<p>
But the
<a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/03/25/knicks-donte-divincenzo-franchise-record-pistons-nba/">Knicks</a>
were blowing out the Pistons on the next channel over, and I had tuned
in Jen Psaki, who as luck would have it, at the exact moment I switched,
was explaining how the fact that she served in the Biden Administration
before joining MSNBC was very different from the controversy over Ronna
McDaniel, who Maddow went on to explain was basically a terrorist and
traitor and Trump co-conspirator (not just an enabler), and not in a war
that was over, but one that was still being fought, and not
insignificant because this fascist movement has control of one of the
two major parties in the US and McDaniel was instrumental in that. There
are good arguments that she should be in a prisoner of war camp, not
employed by one of America’s major news networks.
</p>
<p>
That NBC hired McDaniel as a contributor says something awful about
Maddow’s employer. And Maddow, if she has any details on that, isn’t
saying what they are.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/26/cartoonChicken.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I’ve
had this problem with other reporters in the past whose owners were
caught up in some controversy that made them newsworthy. The reporters
refused to cover it, or even be a source for others who were. This is
where journalism goes wrong imho. Maddow <i>should</i> know the details,
and if she does, she is obligated to share them, because they are
significant, and go to how much trust any of us should give to any news
coming to us from NBC. Maybe she has to quit to do that, and if so, go
ahead and quit. Because the shadow it casts over everything touched by
NBC, which includes MSNBC and Maddow is just too freaking long. It’s
similar to the “news” she reported on Facebook, except now instead of
steering us to believe lies, she’s holding it back, and instead of it
being about one very powerful social media company, it’s about the
future of the government of the US. And maybe she doesn’t know, as
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/21810-it-is-difficult-to-get-a-man-to-understand-something">Upton
Sinclair</a> once said: “It is difficult to get a [person] to understand
something, when [their] salary depends on [them] not understanding it.”
</p>
<p>
I don’t blame Maddow for liking her job. But as a reporter, there are
more and more reasons not to trust her and esp to not trust the company
that employs her. When it was obvious she wasn’t going to tell us the
story behind McDaniel’s hiring, or even name the people responsible for
it, I switched back to the Knicks, where at least I think I understand
who they are and what they’re trying to do.

Shares of former President and presumptive Republican nominee Donald
Trump’s social media company start trading Tuesday morning under the
ticker symbol DJT. Initial public offerings can often bounce on their
inaugural day, which could boost Trump’s wealth — on paper. But first:
some numbers on a critical Baltimore bridge that collapsed overnight.
We’ll also analyze Indigenous household finances and hear about a dip in
sales at casual restaurant chains like Olive Garden.

Andrew Appel shepherded a
<a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2024/03/18/suggested-principles-for-state-statutes-regarding-ballot-marking-and-vote-tabulation/">public
comment</a>—signed by twenty election cybersecurity experts, including
myself—on best practices for ballot marking devices and vote tabulation.
It was written for the Pennsylvania legislature, but it’s general in
nature.
</p>
<p>
From the executive summary:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We believe that no system is perfect, with each having trade-offs.
Hand-marked and hand-counted ballots remove the uncertainty introduced
by use of electronic machinery and the ability of bad actors to exploit
electronic vulnerabilities to remotely alter the results. However, some
portion of voters mistakenly mark paper ballots in a manner that will
not be counted in the way the voter intended, or which even voids the
ballot. Hand-counts delay timely reporting of results, and introduce the
possibility for human error, bias, or misinterpretation…
