<p>date: 2024-11-25, from: National Archives, Pieces of History blog</p>
<p>Long before the President of the United States pardoned a turkey to
celebrate Thanksgiving, the President of Congress issued proclamations
encouraging its celebration. We at the National Archives have written a
lot about the history of Thanksgiving as a federal holiday, often
focusing on Thanksgiving proclamations under the U.S. Constitution or
the aforementioned Presidential turkey …

Bluesky. Next idea is that AWS or Digital Ocean offer a one-click
install of a personal Bluesky. For many years I advocated Amazon offer
Twitter-as-a-service. Now it’s even easier and more urgent. We need to
desiloize this finally.</p>

<p>date: 2024-11-25, from: Advent of Computing</p>
<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">
The Z4, completed by Konrad Zuse in 1945, is a computer with a wild
story. It was made from scrounged parts, survived years of bombing
raids, moved all around Berlin, and eventually took refuge in basements
and stables. In this episode we will follow the Z4’s early days, and
look at how it fits into the larger picture of Zuse’s work. Along the
way there is looting, rumors, and even… IBM!

<p>date: 2024-11-24, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti</p>
<p>
A reader asked me how they’d become a Documentation Engineer, because
they saw I got hired as one and felt curious about what it takes to get
there. This inevitably got me thinking about job titles and the
evolution of tech writing, two topics that are quite central to this
blog. Let me begin with the short answer: As a tech writer you’ll have
to wear many hats, but you’ll always be a technical writer. Depending on
your preferences, some hats will be more comfortable than others. Docs
Engineer is one of those.
