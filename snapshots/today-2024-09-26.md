## FBI seizes New York City mayor's phone ahead of expected unsealing of indictment

date: 2024-09-26, from: VOA News USA

New York — FBI agents entered the official residence of New York City Mayor Eric Adams and seized his phone early Thursday morning, hours before an indictment detailing criminal charges against the Democrat was expected to be made public.


Adams was indicted by a grand jury on federal criminal charges that remain sealed, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.


"Federal agents appeared this morning at Gracie Mansion in an effort to create a spectacle (again) and take Mayor Adams phone (again)," Adams' lawyer, Alex Spiro, said in a statement, adding that the mayor had not been arrested. "They send a dozen agents to pick up a phone when we would have happily turned it in."


Federal law enforcement agents were seen entering the mayor's Manhattan residence at dawn Wednesday, with several vehicles bearing federal law enforcement placards parked outside.


The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan has declined to comment on the investigation. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment. A spokesperson for the mayor did not immediately respond to questions Thursday morning.


In a video speech released Wednesday night, Adams vowed to fight any charges against him, claiming he had been made a "target" in a case "based on lies."


"I will fight these injustices with every ounce of my strength and my spirit," he said.


It was not immediately clear what laws Adams is accused of breaking or when he might have to appear in court.


The indictment caps off an extraordinary few weeks in New York City, as federal investigators have homed in on members of Adams' inner circle, producing a drumbeat of raids, subpoenas and high-level resignations.


Federal prosecutors are believed to be leading multiple, separate inquiries involving Adams and his senior aides, relatives of those aides, campaign fundraising and possible influence peddling of the police and fire departments.


In the last two weeks alone, the city's police commissioner and head of the school's system have announced their resignations.


FBI agents had seized Adams' electronic devices nearly a year ago as part of an investigation focused, at least partly, on campaign contributions and Adams' interactions with the Turkish government. Because the charges were sealed, it was unknown whether they dealt with those same matters.


In early September, federal investigators seized devices from his police commissioner, schools chancellor, two deputy mayors and other trusted confidantes both in and out of City Hall.


All have denied wrongdoing.

## Oxfam: 'Oligarchy' of super-rich undermining cooperation to tackle poverty, climate change

date: 2024-09-26, from: VOA News USA

London — As world leaders gather for the annual United Nations General Assembly in New York this week, the charity Oxfam says they are being undermined by what it calls a “global oligarchy” of the super-rich who exert considerable control over the global economy – and who it blames for exacerbating problems like extreme inequality and climate change.




“Today, the world’s richest 1% own more wealth than 95% of humanity. The immense concentration of wealth, driven significantly by increased monopolistic corporate power, has allowed large corporations and the ultrarich who exercise control over them to use their vast resources to shape global rules in their favor, often at the expense of everyone else,” the Oxfam report says.


The charity says international cooperation on issues like climate change and poverty is failing due to extreme economic inequality.


“The wealth of the world's five richest men has doubled since the start of this decade. And nearly five billion people have got poorer,” said Nabil Ahmed, the director of economic and racial justice at Oxfam America, in an interview with VOA.


Fair taxes


The report urges fairer taxation of large corporations and the ultra-wealthy.


“We live in a world in which mega-corporations… are paying next to or little to no tax basically. Not like the small businesses, not like the rest of us,” Ahmed said.


“It's such a phenomenal lost opportunity because we know governments, rich and poor, across the world need to claw back these revenues to be able to invest in their people, to be able to meet their rights,” he added.


Oxfam praises a campaign led by Brazil, which currently holds the presidency of the G20, to impose a 2% minimum tax on the world’s richest billionaires. Brazil’s government claims it would raise up to $250 billion from about 3,000 individuals, to pay for healthcare, education and tackling climate change.


A report by the French economist Gabriel Zucman, commissioned by Brazil, suggests billionaires currently pay the equivalent of 0.3% of their wealth in taxes.


The plan is backed by other members including South Africa, Spain and France. However, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen spoke against the move at a G20 meeting in July.


“Tax policy is very difficult to coordinate globally and we don't see a need or really think it's desirable to try to negotiate a global agreement on that. We think that all countries should make sure that their taxation systems are fair and progressive,” Yellen told reporters.


Private debt


Oxfam says tax revenues in the global south meanwhile are increasingly spent on servicing debt to private creditors like banks and hedge funds.


“This shift has exacerbated the debt crisis, further entrenching “debtocracy.” Compared with official creditors, private entities issue debt with shorter maturities and higher, more volatile interest rates,” the Oxfam report says.


Vaccines


The charity also accuses large pharmaceutical companies of shaping rules over intellectual property rights to benefit their shareholders. Oxfam says that during the COVID-19 pandemic, this meant poorer nations struggled to access coronavirus vaccines, such as the mRNA vaccine made by Pfizer.


“Its negative impacts are most harshly felt by countries in the Global South, which bear the brunt of “artificial rationing,” where pharmaceutical corporations keep drug costs — and thus profits — high by limiting generic manufacturing, while simultaneously failing to invest in research and development for priority diseases in the Global South deemed less profitable,” Oxfam said.


Responding to VOA, Pfizer highlighted an open letter written by the company’s chairman Albert Bourla in 2021, in which he said the company had created a tiered pricing structure and had offered its mRNA coronavirus vaccine at cost price or for free to poorer nations. However, Bourla said that many richer countries moved faster to purchase the available doses.


“When we developed our tiered pricing policy, we reached out to all nations asking them to place orders so we could allocate doses for them. In reality, the high-income countries reserved most of the doses,” Bourla wrote.


Pfizer’s chairman also warned that losing intellectual property rights could “disincentivize” anyone else from taking a big financial risk in developing such vaccines, a view echoed by other large pharmaceutical giants.

Previous studies have indicated that carbon storage declines in these conditions.

## Harris promises tax breaks, investments for US manufacturers

date: 2024-09-26, from: VOA News USA

PITTSBURGH  — U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said on Wednesday she would offer tax credits to domestic manufacturers and invest in sectors that will "define the next century," as she detailed her economic plan to boost the U.S. middle class.


Speaking at the Economic Club of Pittsburgh in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, the Democratic candidate in the November 5 presidential election said she would give tax credits to U.S. manufacturers for retooling or rebuilding existing factories and expanding "good union jobs," and double the number of registered apprenticeships during her first term.


Harris also promised new investments in industries like bio-manufacturing, aerospace, artificial intelligence and clean energy.


Harris' speech, which lasted just under 40 minutes, did not detail how these policies would work. She highlighted her upbringing by a single mother, in contrast with former President Donald Trump, the wealthy son of a New York real estate developer.


"I have pledged that building a strong middle class will be the defining goal of my presidency," Harris said, adding that she sees the election as a moment of choice between two "fundamentally different" visions of the U.S. economy held by her and her Republican opponent, Trump.


The vice president and Trump are focusing their campaign messaging on the economy, which Reuters/Ipsos polling shows is voters' top concern, as the election approaches.


The divide between rich and poor has grown in recent decades. The share of American households in the middle class, defined as those with two-thirds to double that of median household income, has dropped from around 62% in 1970 to 51% in 2023, Pew Research shows. These households' income has also not grown as fast as those in the top tier.


Harris said she was committed to working with the private sector and entrepreneurs to help grow the middle class. She told the audience that she is "a capitalist" who believes in "free and fair markets," and described her policies as pragmatic rather than rooted in ideology.


Harris in recent months has blunted Trump's advantage on the economy, with a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Tuesday showing the Republican candidate with a marginal advantage of 2 percentage points on "the economy, unemployment and jobs," down from an 11-point lead in late July.


Trump discussed his economic plan in North Carolina on Wednesday and said Harris' role as vice president gave her the chance now to improve the economic record of the Biden administration.


"Families are suffering now. So if she has a plan, she should stop grandstanding and do it," he said. While Trump has proposed across-the-board tariffs on foreign-made goods -- a proposal backed by a slim majority of voters -- Harris is focusing on providing incentives for businesses to keep their operations in the U.S.


Boosting American manufacturing in industries such as semiconductors and bringing back jobs that have moved overseas in recent decades have also been major goals for Biden. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act -- all passed in 2021 and 2022 -- fund a range of subsidies and tax incentives that encourage companies to place projects in disadvantaged regions.

## Hurricane Helene is expected to hit Florida as a major storm, strike far inland

date: 2024-09-26, from: VOA News USA

TALLAHASSEE, Florida  — An enormous Hurricane Helene swamped parts of Mexico on Wednesday as it churned on a path forecasters said would take it to Florida as a potentially catastrophic storm with a surge that could swallow entire homes, a chilling warning that sent residents scrambling for higher ground, closed schools, and led to states of emergency throughout the Southeast.


Helene's center was about 735 kilometers southwest of Tampa, Florida, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said, and the hurricane was expected to intensify and accelerate as it crosses the Gulf of Mexico toward the Big Bend area of Florida's northwestern coast. Landfall was expected sometime Thursday evening, and the hurricane center said by then it could be a major Category 4 storm with winds above 208 kph.


Tropical storm conditions were expected in southern Florida on Wednesday night, spreading northward and encompassing the rest of Florida as well as Georgia and South Carolina through Thursday night. The storm was moving north at 19 kph with top sustained winds of 140 kph Wednesday evening.


Helene could create a life-threatening storm surge as high as 6.1 meters in parts of the Big Bend region, forecasters said. Its tropical storm-force winds extended as far as 555 kilometers from its center.


The fast-moving storm's wind and rain also could penetrate far inland: The hurricane center posted hurricane warnings well into Georgia and tropical storm warnings as far north as North Carolina, and it warned that much of the Southeast could experience prolonged power outages, toppled trees and dangerous flooding.




"Just hope and pray that everybody's safe," said Connie Dillard, of Tallahassee, as she shopped at a grocery store with thinning shelves of water and bread before hitting the highway out of town. "That's all you can do."


One insurance firm, Gallagher Re, is expecting billions of dollars in damage in the U.S. Around 18,000 linemen from out of state staged in Florida, ready to help restore power. Airports in St. Petersburg, Tallahassee and Tampa were planning to close on Thursday, and 62 hospitals, nursing homes and assisted living facilities evacuated their residents Wednesday.


Georgia activated 250 National Guard soldiers for rapid deployment. State game wardens, foresters and Department of Correction teams will help provide swift-water rescues and other emergency responses.


State meteorologist Will Lanxton said tropical storm-force winds are expected throughout Georgia. Lanxton said metro Atlanta hasn't seen sustained tropical storm winds since Hurricane Irma in 2017.


"I think we're going to see some significant power outages, probably nothing like we've seen, because it's 159 counties wide," said James Stallings, director of the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency.


In Tallahassee, where stations started to run out of gas, 19-year-old Florida A&M student Kameron Benjamin filled sandbags with his roommate to protect their apartment before evacuating. Their school and Florida State shut down.


"This hurricane is heading straight to Tallahassee, so I really don't know what to expect," Benjamin said.


As Big Bend residents battened down their homes, many saw the ghost of 2018's Hurricane Michael. That storm rapidly intensified and crashed ashore as a Category 5 that laid waste to Panama City and parts of the rural Panhandle.


On Wednesday, the National Weather Service posted an urgent warning for residents along Apalachee Bay: "There is a danger of catastrophic and unsurvivable storm surge for Apalachee Bay," it said. "Storm surge may begin to arrive as early as late Wednesday night ahead of the winds. This forecast, if realized, is a nightmare surge scenario for Apalachee Bay. Please, please, please take any evacuation orders seriously!"


"People are taking heed and hightailing it out of there for higher ground," said Kristin Korinko, a Tallahassee resident who serves as the commodore of the Shell Point Sailboard Club, on the Gulf Coast about 48 kilometers south of Tallahassee.


For toughened Floridians who are used to hurricanes, Robbie Berg, a national warning coordinator for the hurricane center, advised: "Please do not compare it to other storms you may have experienced over the past year or two."


Helene is forecast to be one of the largest storms in breadth in years to hit the region, said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. He said since 1988, only three Gulf hurricanes were bigger than Helene's predicted size: 2017's Irma, 2005's Wilma and 1995's Opal.


Areas 160 kilometers north of the Georgia-Florida line can expect hurricane conditions. More than half of Georgia's public school districts and several universities canceled classes.


And for Atlanta, which is under a tropical storm watch, Helene could be the worst strike on a major Southern inland city in 35 years, said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd.


"It's going to be a lot like Hugo in Charlotte," Shepherd said of the 1989 storm that struck the North Carolina city, knocking out power to 85% of customers as winds gusted above hurricane force.




Landslides were possible in southern Appalachia, with catastrophic flooding predicted in the Carolinas and Georgia, where all three governors declared emergencies. Rainfall is possible as far away as Tennessee, Kentucky and Indiana.


Parts of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula were under hurricane warnings as Helene wound between it and the western tip of Cuba and into the Gulf of Mexico. The storm formed Tuesday in the Caribbean, and it flooded streets and toppled trees as it passed offshore and brushed the resort city of Cancun.


In Cuba, authorities moved cattle to higher ground and medical brigades went to communities often cut off by storms. The government preventively shut off power in some communities as waves as high as 5 meters slammed Cortes Bay. In the Cayman Islands, schools remained closed as residents pumped water from flooded homes.


In the U.S., federal authorities positioned generators, food and water, along with search-and-rescue and power restoration teams.


Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that Helene could be as strong as a Category 4 hurricane when it makes landfall. The state was providing buses to evacuate people in the Big Bend region and taking them to shelters in Tallahassee.


But near Florida's center, outside Orlando, Walt Disney World said its only closures Thursday would be the Typhoon Lagoon water park and its miniature golf courses.


Helene is the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-average Atlantic hurricane season this year because of record-warm ocean temperatures.


In the Pacific, former Hurricane John reformed Wednesday as a tropical storm and was strengthening as it threatened areas of Mexico's western coast. Officials posted hurricane warnings for southwestern Mexico.


John hit the country's southern Pacific coast late Monday, killing at least two people, triggering mudslides, and damaging homes and trees. It grew into a Category 3 hurricane in a matter of hours and made landfall east of Acapulco. It reemerged over the ocean after weakening inland.

## PostgreSQL 17 Released!

date: 2024-09-26, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>The <a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL Global Development Group</a>
today announced the release of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/release-17.html">PostgreSQL 17</a>,
the latest version of the world's most advanced open source database.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL 17 builds on decades of open source development, improving its
performance and scalability while adapting to emergent data access and storage
patterns. This release of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> adds
significant overall performance gains, including an overhauled memory management
implementation for vacuum, optimizations to storage access and improvements for
high concurrency workloads, speedups in bulk loading and exports, and query
execution improvements for indexes. PostgreSQL 17 has features that benefit
brand new workloads and critical systems alike, such as additions to the
developer experience with the SQL/JSON <code>JSON_TABLE</code> command, and enhancements to
logical replication that simplify management of high availability workloads and
major version upgrades.</p>
<p>"PostgreSQL 17 highlights how the global open source community, which drives the
development of PostgreSQL, builds enhancements that help users at all stages of
their database journey," said Jonathan Katz, a member of the PostgreSQL core
team. "Whether it's improvements for operating databases at scale or
new features that build on a delightful developer experience, PostgreSQL 17
will enhance your data management experience." </p>
<p>PostgreSQL, an innovative data management system known for its reliability,
robustness, and extensibility, benefits from over 25 years of open source
development from a global developer community and has become the preferred open
source relational database for organizations of all sizes.</p>
<h3>System-wide performance gains</h3>
<p>The PostgreSQL <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/routine-vacuuming.html">vacuum</a>
process is critical for healthy operations, requiring server instance resources
to operate. PostgreSQL 17 introduces a new internal memory structure for vacuum
that consumes up to 20x less memory. This improves vacuum speed and
also reduces the use of shared resources, making more available for your
workload.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL 17 continues to improve performance of its I/O layer. High
concurrency workloads may see up to 2x better write throughput due to
improvements with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/wal-intro.html">write-ahead log</a>
(<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/wal-intro.html">WAL</a>) processing.
Additionally, the new streaming I/O interface speeds up sequential scans
(reading all the data from a table) and how quickly
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-analyze.html"><code>ANALYZE</code></a> can update
planner statistics.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL 17 also extends its performance gains to query execution.
PostgreSQL 17 improves the performance of queries with <code>IN</code> clauses that use
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/indexes-types.html#INDEXES-TYPES-BTREE">B-tree</a>
indexes, the default index method in PostgreSQL. Additionally,
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/brin.html">BRIN</a> indexes now support
parallel builds. PostgreSQL 17 includes several improvements for query planning,
including optimizations for <code>NOT NULL</code> constraints, and improvements in
processing <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/queries-with.html">common table expressions</a>
(<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/queries-with.html"><code>WITH</code> queries</a>). This
release adds more SIMD (Single Instruction/Multiple Data) support for
accelerating computations, including using AVX-512 for the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-bitstring.html"><code>bit_count</code></a>
function.</p>
<h3>Further expansion of a robust developer experience</h3>
<p>PostgreSQL was the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-92-released-1415/">first relational database to add JSON support (2012)</a>,
and PostgreSQL 17 adds to its implementation of the SQL/JSON standard.
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-SQLJSON-TABLE"><code>JSON_TABLE</code></a>
is now available in PostgreSQL 17, letting developers convert JSON data into a
standard PostgreSQL table. PostgreSQL 17 now supports <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-CREATION-TABLE">SQL/JSON constructors</a>
(<code>JSON</code>, <code>JSON_SCALAR</code>, <code>JSON_SERIALIZE</code>) and
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-json.html#SQLJSON-QUERY-FUNCTIONS">query functions</a>
(<code>JSON_EXISTS</code>, <code>JSON_QUERY</code>, <code>JSON_VALUE</code>), giving developers other ways of
interfacing with their JSON data. This release adds more
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-SQLJSON-PATH-OPERATORS"><code>jsonpath</code> expressions</a>,
with an emphasis of converting JSON data to a native PostgreSQL data type,
including numeric, boolean, string, and date/time types.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL 17 adds more features to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-merge.html"><code>MERGE</code></a>,
which is used for conditional updates, including a <code>RETURNING</code> clause and the
ability to update <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-createview.html">views</a>.
Additionally, PostgreSQL 17 has new capabilities for bulk loading and data
exporting, including up to a 2x performance improvement when exporting large rows
using the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-copy.html"><code>COPY</code></a> command.
<code>COPY</code> performance also has improvements when the source and destination
encodings match, and includes a new option, <code>ON_ERROR</code>, that allows an import to
continue even if there is an insert error.</p>
<p>This release expands on functionality both for managing data in partitions and
data distributed across remote PostgreSQL instances. PostgreSQL 17 supports
using identity columns and exclusion constraints on
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/ddl-partitioning.html">partitioned tables</a>.
The <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/postgres-fdw.html">PostgreSQL foreign data wrapper</a>
(<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/postgres-fdw.html"><code>postgres_fdw</code></a>), used
to execute queries on remote PostgreSQL instances, can now push <code>EXISTS</code> and
<code>IN</code> subqueries to the remote server for more efficient processing.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL 17 also includes a built-in, platform independent, immutable
collation provider that's guaranteed to be immutable and provides similar
sorting semantics to the <code>C</code> collation except with <code>UTF-8</code> encoding rather than
<code>SQL_ASCII</code>. Using this new collation provider guarantees that your text-based
queries will return the same sorted results regardless of where you run
PostgreSQL.</p>
<h3>Logical replication enhancements for high availability and major version upgrades</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/logical-replication.html">Logical replication</a>
is used to stream data in real-time across many use cases. However, prior to
this release, users who wanted to perform a major version upgrade would have to
drop <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/logical-replication-subscription.html#LOGICAL-REPLICATION-SUBSCRIPTION-SLOT">logical replication slots</a>, which requires resynchronizing data
to subscribers after an upgrade. Starting with upgrades from PostgreSQL 17,
users don't have to drop logical replication slots, simplifying the upgrade
process when using logical replication.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL 17 now includes failover control for logical replication, making it
more resilient when deployed in high availability environments. Additionally,
PostgreSQL 17 introduces the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/app-pgcreatesubscriber.html"><code>pg_createsubscriber</code></a>
command-line tool for converting a physical replica into a new logical replica.</p>
<h3>More options for managing security and operations</h3>
<p>PostgreSQL 17 further extends how users can manage the overall lifecycle of
their database systems. PostgreSQL has a new TLS option, <code>sslnegotiation</code>, that
lets users perform a direct TLS handshakes when using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-Layer_Protocol_Negotiation">ALPN</a>
(registered as <code>postgresql</code> in the ALPN directory). PostgreSQL 17 also adds the
<code>pg_maintain</code> <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/predefined-roles.html">predefined role</a>,
which gives users permission to perform maintenance operations.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/app-pgbasebackup.html"><code>pg_basebackup</code></a>, the
backup utility included in PostgreSQL, now supports incremental backups and adds
the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/app-pgcombinebackup.html"><code>pg_combinebackup</code></a> 
utility to reconstruct a full backup. Additionally,
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/app-pgdump.html"><code>pg_dump</code></a> includes a new
option called <code>--filter</code> that lets you select what objects to include when
generating a dump file.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL 17 also includes enhancements to monitoring and analysis features.
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-explain.html"><code>EXPLAIN</code></a> now shows the
time spent for local I/O block reads and writes, and includes two new options:
<code>SERIALIZE</code> and <code>MEMORY</code>, useful for seeing the time spent in data conversion
for network transmission, and how much memory was used. PostgreSQL 17 now
reports the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/progress-reporting.html#VACUUM-PROGRESS-REPORTING">progress of vacuuming indexes</a>,
and adds the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/view-pg-wait-events.html"><code>pg_wait_events</code></a>
system view that, when combined with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-PG-STAT-ACTIVITY-VIEW"><code>pg_stat_activity</code></a>,
gives more insight into why an active session is waiting.</p>
<h3>Additional Features</h3>
<p>Many other new features and improvements have been added to PostgreSQL 17 that
may also be helpful for your use cases. Please see the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/release-17.html">release notes</a> for a
complete list of new and changed features.</p>
<h3>About PostgreSQL</h3>

## Biden reaches out to Africa at UN General Assembly

date: 2024-09-25, from: VOA News USA

new york — President Joe Biden is turning to Africa in the sunset of his presidency. In the space of one day, in front of world leaders, he elevated Sudan's conflict to a priority, announced he would travel to Angola and endorsed adding two seats for African countries to the U.N. Security Council.


In his valedictory speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, Biden made several brief overtures to the African continent — reminding world leaders of the evils of South Africa’s apartheid regime, calling for an end to Sudan’s grueling conflict and citing urgency in combating an mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.


But these two short lines may have the most weight:


“The U.N. needs to adapt to bring in new voices and new perspectives,” he said. “That’s why we support reforming and expanding the membership of the U.N. Security Council.”


For years, African leaders have called for a seat at this table. But critics point out that Washington does not support a critical privilege enjoyed by the current permanent members of the Security Council: veto power.


Cameron Hudson, a senior fellow in the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says African nations are puzzled by Biden’s position.


“This is really, I think, an unfinished project of his, probably more words than reality,” he told VOA. The fact that Biden supported council membership for them but not veto power "has left Africans scratching their heads."


John Fortier, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said it mattered that Biden used this platform to call for an end to Sudan’s raging 17-month conflict, but he doubted whether that call would provoke action.


Trying to elevate issue


“This is one of the conflicts that is serious but has not been getting world attention, and I think his pointing to it is really to elevate it in world consciousness but not yet to really know how we're going to see an end to this,” Fortier said.


This conflict has displaced millions of people and sparked a near-famine. And so, analysts say, it matters that the American president is putting pressure on the warring parties.


“I think Biden genuinely wants to alleviate the humanitarian crisis and resolve the conflict in Sudan,” said Daniel Volman, director of the African Security Research Project, in an email to VOA. “But I think he is reluctant to press countries like Egypt and the [United Arab] Emirates that are arming the generals, because they are key allies during the Gaza war.


“Also, Biden is being driven by pressure from some members of Congress to take stronger and more effective action. I think he will take some limited action, like the new funds for humanitarian aid just announced, but I don't think this will yield significant results.”


And finally, Biden’s off-camera announcement that he will visit Angola next month allows him to keep his promise to visit the continent. But again, Hudson wondered how this long-delayed visit would land.


“Coming, as it does, at the very tail end of his administration, without much to, I think, really celebrate in terms of his involvement in Africa, I think the visit will ring rather hollow,” Hudson said.


Biden has four months left in his presidency.

## Climate Week Is an AI Lovefest

date: 2024-09-25, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY4ODE0OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2OTg3ODMzNX0.jvR4fuhA-g-zlduZ2kozsZg0YhbhqbwqE6TlMRdVAHI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">There’s a simple and well-supported story to tell about the projected growth in electricity demand coming from data centers, population growth, and new factories, i.e. that it will boost the fossil fuel industry. When faced with the need for more electricity generation, utilities will simply build more natural gas power plants, and market overseers will act to ensure that aging <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/elgin-natural-gas-pjm" target="_self"><u>gas</u></a> and <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/coal-gas-plant-retirements" target="_self"><u>coal plants</u></a> don’t get shut down. Some version of this story is already playing out in Arizona, the Southeast, and the Mid-Atlantic.</p><p>Many green activists are understandably wary of the data center boom, seeing it as a “unique opportunity for fossil fuel interests to get in while the getting is still good and turn a digital and industrial boom into yet another gas boom,” as the Natural Resources Defense Council said of Georgia, where a 15-times increase in projected electricity demand has Georgia Power scrambling for more fossil fuels.</p><p>However this is not the story I’ve been hearing this week in New York City, where thousands of government officials, climate activists, celebrities, investors, and executives have descended for the annual meeting-and-panel extravaganza that is Climate Week. For the Biden Administration officials, clean energy executives, and technological visionaries flitting between sponsored events, data center load growth is,<a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004343.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> </a>as John F. Kennedy might have put it in one of his <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004343.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>frequent flights of amateur Chinese linguistics</u></a>, a danger and opportunity mixed into one.</p><p>“This can be a good-news story. The sky doesn’t necessarily need to be falling,” Kelly Sanders, assistant director for energy systems innovation at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said during a panel discussion hosted by the think tank Third Way, referring to load growth from manufacturing and data centers. “This could actually be good for clean energy.”</p><p>And <em><em>very good</em></em> for anyone who can promise to deliver said clean energy, even if it’s years in the future. During a “fireside chat” at Geothermal House, a day-long summit on geothermal energy sponsored by Project InnerSpace, a geothermal nonprofit, Mike Schroepfer, the former CTO of Meta who is now a climate venture investor, said the demand for power from AI was “the best news ever.” He argued that having companies with big power needs and deep pockets was <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/ai-additionality-framework" target="_self"><u>much better for clean energy development</u></a> than having a stagnant grid that’s just trying to replace dirty power plants. </p><p>Among those in the same rah-rah camp, the general idea is that energy-hungry data centers can help get new clean energy sources like advanced geothermal through the project finance "valley of death" so they can eventually deliver affordable, clean power to the rest of us. “For the first time in history, demand for clean energy outstrips supply,” said Ally Yost, a senior vice president at Commonwealth Fusion Systems, during a panel discussion in New York City. “Those that have access to that clean power will be in a very profitable situation.”</p><p>“AI is a gift for fusion,” added Clay Dumas, a partner at Lowercarbon Capital, a Commonwealth investor. He even conceded that the skyrocketing demand was a “gift for fission,” from which fusion advocates are typically at pains to distinguish themselves. “There’s an intense interest and demand for clean electrons,” he said, referencing the recent deal to bring back a<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/microsoft-three-mile-island-nuclear-constellation" target="_self"> <u>shuttered reactor at Three Mile Island</u></a>, alongside a power purchase agreement with Microsoft.</p><p>That investors and executives at fusion companies were talking about meeting projected load growth is a good sign of how heady the financial and technology prospects have gotten for anyone who has a good story to tell (and some capital). Fusion’s claim to be the holy grail of energy has passed over time from aspiration to irony and back again,<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/fusion" target="_self"> <u>thanks to billions piled into the industry in the past few years</u></a>.</p><p>This combination of dreaminess and realism prevailed at Commonwealth’s event, where Dumas said that when he first invested in the company, “there was an exciting story of how fusion or a company like CFS could provide 5, 10, 20% of the world’s primary energy and could become the biggest company in the history of capitalism,” Dumas said. (Perhaps not surprisingly, several former SpaceX employees work at Commonwealth.) Now the focus is on getting a power plant developed with technology that the industry insists will be ready to go online on a reasonable timeframe — something more like a decade than the standard 20 or 30 years.</p><p>But whether you’re splitting atoms or fusing them, the demand for clean power from data centers is coming in months and years, not decades. OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman reportedly<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-24/openai-pitched-white-house-on-unprecedented-data-center-buildout" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> </a>told the White House he <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-24/openai-pitched-white-house-on-unprecedented-data-center-buildout" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wants to build 5-gigawatt data centers</u></a>, which would take the equivalent of five large nuclear reactors to power. Even <em><em>re</em></em>starting an existing fission plant takes at least three years, while building a new one using existing typically takes around … well no one knows because there are no plans currently to do so.<br/><br/>“People are not going to be patient” if new clean power can’t be developed quickly, Juliann Edwards, the founder and chief executive of The Nuclear Company, told me this week. “They're going to go build more gas plants.”</p><p>Kathleen Barrón, the chief strategy officer at Constellation, the country’s leading nuclear energy providers, said during the panel hosted by Third Way that conversations about new nuclear are “starting to happen,” and that the most important part of that process is coming up with a reasonable cost estimate. “Once you know what it costs, you can figure out what contributions will be,” she said, referring to the nasty problem of how to split up the expense among various stakeholders, including the government. Barrón pointed out that the second reactor at Vogtle was almost a third cheaper than the first — meaning that maybe the nuclear industry has a chance of getting a handle on costs. In the meantime, owners of existing plants will be happy to reopen and expand what they can, picking up generous incentives all along the way.</p><p>Edwards told me she’s been speaking with potential offtakers like Amazon and Meta, utilities, independent power producers, and investors in pursuit of having “binding contracts” for new plants by late 2026. But the hyperscalers committed to using clean power will need more than that. </p><p>Lucia Tian, a former official at the Department of Energy’s Loan Program Office who now heads of clean energy and decarbonization technologies at Google, estimated that Google’s clean energy needs would be largely served from existing renewable technologies “that we can deploy at scale,” which, paired with storage, would get the company to around 80% of its needs. “But in order to get that last 20%, we need a suite of technologies including nuclear, long-duration energy storage, fossil generation with carbon capture and storage.”</p><p>Behind each of these promising technologies is a unique deployment issue. Geothermal might work in the western United States only, for instance, and even then not before the late 2020s. As for nuclear, outside of reopening shuttered plants and uprating existing ones, Tian said, “the reality that everyone recognizes” is that if “I sign a deal today” for a small modular reactor or the <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/the-nuclear-company-reactors" target="_self"><u>existing AP1000 design</u></a>, “it’s not going to come online before 2030.” This leaves “a strong role for CCS,” she added, referring to using natural gas with carbon capture and storage, an approach strongly encouraged by <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/epa-power-plant-rules-gas" target="_self"><u>new Environmental Protection Agency rules for gas plants</u></a>, but one that is by no means widespread today.</p><p>Making progress on a technology that’s been in development for decades and still involves extracting and burning a fossil fuel doesn’t quite meet the futuristic moment the data center and artificial intelligence boom has created in the present.</p><p>“Every day someone asks, <em><em>can’t you foot the billion dollar risk of a nuclear reactor?</em></em>” Tian said. The future will have to wait a bit longer, but the data centers are coming now.</p>

## US House Speaker wants Ukraine's ambassador fired over Zelenskyy ammunition plant visit

date: 2024-09-25, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The Republican Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives demanded on Wednesday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy fire his ambassador to the United States over Zelenskyy's trip this week to a factory in Pennsylvania.


"I demand that you immediately fire Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova," Speaker Mike Johnson wrote in a letter to Zelenskyy.


Johnson released the letter a day before Zelenskyy was due to visit the U.S. Capitol in Washington for meetings with lawmakers. Johnson was not expected to meet with the Ukrainian leader.


The Ukrainian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


Some Republicans have been fuming over Zelenskyy's visit earlier in his weeklong trip to the United States to an ammunition plant in President Joe Biden's hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is one of the swing states seen as crucial to victory in the November 5 presidential election.


During the trip, Zelenskyy also met with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Senator Bob Casey and U.S. Representative Matt Cartwright, who are all Democrats.


Biden's vice president, Kamala Harris, is the Democratic candidate running against Republican former President Donald Trump in the race for the White House.


"The facility was in a politically contested battleground state, was led by a top political surrogate for Kamala Harris, and failed to include a single Republican because — on purpose — no Republicans were invited," Johnson wrote.


"The tour was clearly a partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats and is clearly election interference," he said.


The Republican-led House Oversight Committee had already announced that it would investigate whether Zelenskyy's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris' campaign.


It is common practice for governors to meet with foreign leaders who travel to their states. In July, Zelenskyy visited a factory in Utah and was hosted by that state's Republican governor, Spencer Cox.

## US Congress passes temporary bill to avoid government shutdown

date: 2024-09-25, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Congress on Wednesday passed a temporary measure that keeps government agencies funded into December, avoiding a shutdown for now while punting final spending decisions until after the Nov. 5 election.


The Senate approved the measure by a vote of 78-18 shortly after the House easily approved it. The bill generally funds agencies at current levels through Dec. 20. But an additional $231 million was included to bolster the Secret Service after the two assassination attempts against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Money was also added to aid with the presidential transition, among other things.


The bill now goes to President Joe Biden's desk to be signed into law.


“This bipartisanship is a good outcome for America,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said moments before the vote. “I hope it sets the tone for more constructive, bipartisan work when we return in the fall.”


House Speaker Mike Johnson billed the measure as doing “only what's absolutely necessary," a statement directed at members of his own conference concerned about spending levels.


Still, it was a no-go for some Republicans, which forced House Republican leadership to rely on Democratic votes to pass the bill through a process that requires at least two-thirds support from voting members. Johnson said the only alternative to the continuing resolution at this stage would have been a government shutdown.


“It would be political malpractice to shut the government down," Johnson said. "I think everyone understands that.”


The House floor was largely empty during debate on the measure. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, was the lone critic speaking out, saying, “We end up in a vicious circle every year, the same vicious circle.”


Lawmakers in both chambers are anxious to return to their home states and districts to campaign, smoothing the path for passage of a temporary funding fix. But more arduous fiscal negotiations await them at the end of the year.


Under terms of a previous deal to avoid a federal default and allow the government to continue paying its bills, spending for defense and nondefense programs would rise 1% next year.


The Senate has been charting a course to go above that level, while House Republicans have been voting for steep cuts to many nondefense programs, and they have attached policy mandates to the spending bills that Democrats overwhelmingly oppose. So a final agreement will be difficult to reach.


In the meantime, the temporary bill will mostly fund the government at current levels, with a few exceptions like the funding infusion for the Secret Service.


The $231 million for the Secret Service does come with strings attached. It's contingent upon the agency complying with congressional oversight. The bill also allows the Secret Service to spend its allocations faster if needed.


“Everybody understands that's critically important right now,” Johnson said of the Secret Service money.


Trump thanked lawmakers for the extra Secret Service funding at a campaign event Wednesday. He had earlier called on Republicans not to move forward on a spending bill without also including a requirement that people provide proof of citizenship when registering to vote. That legislation failed in the House last week.


In a recent letter, the Secret Service told lawmakers that a funding shortfall was not the reason for lapses in Trump’s security when a gunman climbed onto an unsecured roof on July 13 at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and opened fire. But acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr., also made clear the agency had “immediate needs” and that he’s talking to Congress.


“The Secret Service has asked for this additional funding. It's absolutely essential as they deal with the increased threat environment,” said Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee.


The continuing resolution is needed because Congress is nowhere close to completing work on the dozen annual appropriations bills that fund much of the federal government. The House has passed five of the 12 bills, mostly along party lines. The Senate has passed zero.


Republicans blame the current impasse on Senate Democrats for not putting the dozen appropriations bills on the Senate floor for a vote, where they then could be reconciled with the House bills during negotiations. But Democrats counter that House Republicans are acting in bad faith, bogging the process down by undercutting an agreement that former Speaker Kevin McCarthy negotiated with the White House over spending caps for the 2024 and 2025 budget years.


Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democratic member of the House Appropriations Committee, said her party will accept nothing less than the 1% increase specified in that agreement. Also, if Republicans seek more than that for defense, there must be “dollar for dollar parity for nondefense," she said.


“We know where we have to end up. And it is my hope that this bill will provide the bipartisan momentum needed to get there,” DeLauro said.


The White House called on both chambers to pass the stopgap bill, while cautioning that it did not provide adequate funding to help communities recover from natural disasters and failed to include enough funding for health care provided through the Department of Veterans Affairs.


Johnson warned that when the new extension expires in December, he will not support a massive, catchall bill to fund the government, referred to as an omnibus, so another stopgap may be needed that would allow the new president and Congress to have the final say on fiscal year 2025 spending levels.


“I have no intention of going back to that terrible tradition,” Johnson said.


Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, urged House Republicans not to “follow the loudest voices on the far right” in the spending negotiations for the full-year bill.


“You cannot strike a deal to govern with people who do not really want to govern," Murray said.

## The EV Charging Problem Is Getting Worse

date: 2024-09-25, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY4NTgwNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2OTY0NTU3OX0.SJUm7ySvirQJmvs9PI6l3yzi8otV2IXFhejt3Nl_F_g/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Last year, a great <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-supercharger-ford-gm" target="_blank">streamlining of electric vehicle charging infrastructure</a> looked imminent. One by one, the major automakers committed to using the North American Charging Standard, or NACS, which was formerly Tesla’s proprietary plug. The moves would allow EV drivers of all stripes to use Tesla’s Supercharger network and would move the industry toward a single standard where things worked seamlessly. Earlier this month, GM joined the ranks of Ford and Rivian in having its vehicles officially able to visit nearly 18,000 Supercharger stations. </p><p>All of the GM vehicles built up to this point, however, carry the previous charging standard for non-Tesla EVs. You know what that means: dongles. </p><p>Drivers in combustion cars choose between regular, plus, and premium gas, but they don’t worry that they’ll pull into a station and the pump won’t fit their car. EVs, meanwhile, still have to deal with a mess of competing plug standards and confusing customer interfaces at charging stations. This situation is the inescapable result of a fast-moving, fledgling industry, yes. But the complexity is an annoyingly sticky barrier to EV adoption.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/lexus/gm-nacs-adapter-tesla-superchargers-released" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>adapter</u></a> necessary to make a GM EV work with a Tesla plug, for instance, <em><em>is</em></em> available. But there’s a waiting list, and the piece costs $225 — effectively a $225 early adopter penalty for buying your EV back before everyone agreed on how to cooperate. When Ford transitioned to NACS earlier this year, it had difficulty extracting enough adapters from Tesla to meet the demand, dragging out the process for months for some of its EV drivers. GM <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sashalekach/2024/06/20/tesla-supercharger-adapters-delayed-for-all-general-motors-evs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>had been slated</u></a> to join the Supercharger network months earlier and could not because of the dongle delays.</p><p>Not all the eligible cars just <em><em>work</em></em>, either. After GM electric vehicles were welcomed to Tesla Superchargers, it turned out that lots of Chevrolet Bolts made in 2019 and 2020 (when they were the best-selling non-Tesla EVs) <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/734169/chevy-bolt-supercharging-dealer-service/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>needed to visit the dealership</u></a> for a software update before they could link up with a Tesla plug.</p><p>Software patches and dongles may be an annoyance, a kind of Band-Aid to make two systems that weren’t meant to work together play nice, but at least a quick fix is possible. A bigger issue for streamlining charging stations is that the locations of charging ports on EVs themselves are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/11g9xf3/charge_port_side/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>far from standardized</u></a>. </p><p>All Tesla models have ports in the rear on the driver’s side; Supercharging stations are typically built for drivers to back in and then find the appropriate cord right next to their charging port. A Chevy Bolt’s port, however, is found on the driver’s side but on the front. A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ioniq5/comments/tejw4h/hate_the_charge_port_location/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Hyundai Ioniq 5’s</u></a> is in the back, but on the <em><em>passenger side</em></em>. When Rivian revealed the R2 and R3 designs, their ports were on the passenger side rear because the brand thought that location would fit into its existing network of chargers and make it easier to plug into street-side plugs. Then came an outcry from fans distraught at how difficult it would be to use a Tesla Supercharger if the port were on the wrong side and the cable had to wrap all the way around the back of the vehicle. <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/729686/rivian-r2-charge-port-location/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Rivian changed its mind</u></a>.</p><p>Thank goodness for that, because the situation at Superchargers is poised to get messy. I’ve been to ones where Tesla plugs were available, but I could not park my Model 3 within reach of one because other EVs parked incorrectly in order to plug in. Tesla’s lead engineer for the Cybertruck had to <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/09/18/tesla-throws-cold-water-on-supercharger-extension-cords/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>warn</u></a> people not to use extension cords at Superchargers since that might lead to electrical shorts.</p><p>Some relief is on the way. In the coming years, most car companies will build the NACS standard into their electric vehicles, negating the need for expensive adapters and dongles. With so much emphasis on using the Supercharger network, it’s likely the brands will feel pressure to follow Rivian’s lead and just put the port where Tesla puts it.</p><p>But then there’s the last piece of the puzzle: the interface. Tesla beat the competition at charging not only by building a bigger and far more reliable network, but also by inventing a seamless way to pay for electricity: When you plug in, the system knows it’s your car and charges the credit card on file. Non-Tesla drivers are beginning to experience this convenience when they stop at the Supercharger.</p><p>Competing systems, though, rely on a variety of phone apps that may or may not work, especially in places with spotty cell coverage. Tech companies are trying to solve this problem with, you guessed it, AI. Revel, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/18/nyregion/revel-mopeds-nyc-e-scooter.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>used to offer</u></a> rentable mopeds around New York City, has tried to reposition itself as an EV charging company. It just partnered with a computer vision company to <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/734331/revel-ev-charging-juice-ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announce</u></a> a kind of facial recognition system for your car so that the charging station knows it’s you.</p><p>Of course, one could just copy Tesla’s idea and have the charging cord auto-identify each vehicle, or even simply install a camera to read the car’s license plate instead of overcomplicating the basic task of IDing a car. But those solutions don’t use the magic technology of the moment.</p>

## The Grudge Match Over Maine’s Plans for Offshore Wind

date: 2024-09-25, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY4NjA5MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNjM4MDYwNH0.zGqK4ttk9G_Z4xAuiUS9yoNiZG8mDYlqcD7p6Tdkkos/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">The future of floating offshore wind in America rests on a feud between YIMBY state officials and a government whistleblower over a bucolic island off the coast of Maine. I have no clue who will win. </p><p>Floating offshore wind is Maine’s best bet for wind power in deeper stretches of ocean, far away from beach views, coastal properties, and valuable fishing grounds. The tech — which other countries have tried to deploy but is still unproven at large commercial scale — offers a hypothetical panacea for the sorts of conflicts that often stymie offshore wind, and other states are looking to it as a solution for these thorny issues, <a href="https://calmatters.org/environment/2024/07/california-offshore-wind-plan-approved/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>including California</u></a>. </p><p>But Maine has chosen to construct its floating offshore wind turbine assembly site at Sears Island, a naturalist tourist destination in Penobscot Bay. Conservationists in New England have fought for <a href="https://www.bangordailynews.com/2024/03/02/midcoast/midcoast-environment/history-failed-developments-sears-island-maine-wind-port-joam40zk0w/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a long time</u></a> to preserve the island, an incredibly biodiverse ecosystem rich with wetlands, from the Maine Department of Transportation, which over decades has attempted to use a section of the island for various forms of infrastructure, including an industrial port. </p><p>Now that this longstanding conflict has become intertwined with the cause of carbon reduction, it is pitting an older generation of eco-warriors against a younger breed of climate activists, as well as local unions eager to get in on energy transition jobs. Unfortunately for Maine regulators, one of the old heads opposing this project is Kyla Bennett, a former wetlands permitting staffer at the Environmental Protection Agency who stopped a previous effort by the Maine Department of Transportation to build a port at Sears Island in the 1990s. </p><p>At EPA, Bennett determined that <a href="https://peer.org/kyla-bennett-from-whistleblower-to-whistleblower-defender/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>constructing the port</u></a> would’ve been illegal under the Clean Water Act because of the sheer proliferation of obvious wetlands. When political officials interceded and reassigned her to a different job, she blew the whistle on them — and won, winning back her post. The port permits were also denied. </p><p>Bennett is now a key organizer for Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, an organization that represents whistleblowers doing environmental protection work in government. And she’s making it a hobby horse to, again, <a href="https://peer.org/maine-poised-to-repeat-eco-mistakes-sears-island/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>stop Sears Island</u></a> from becoming a port — even if it’s in the name of developing technology that could stem the tide of climate change. </p><p>“It’s déjà vu. It’s really disturbing to me that it’s back and we have to do this all over again,” she told me. </p><p>The facility has to go <em><em>somewhere</em></em> because, well, the technicians and researchers need a place to build these turbines, and Maine has claimed that no port existing today on the East Coast fits the precise spacing and resource needs. Habib Dagher, a University of Maine professor who leads the consortium plotting a U.S. offshore wind industry, told me constructing a port for assembly is “critical” to near-term success. </p><p>Yet there <em>is</em> another option. Moffat and Nichols, the engineering firm that studied port locations for Maine regulators, <em><em>did</em></em> conclude <a href="https://www.spragueenergy.com/mack-point/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Mack Point</u></a>, an existing import terminal on the coast of the Penobscot owned by Sprague Energy, would also fit the bill. Sprague is proposing to pay for a large expansion of Mack Point to take this floating offshore wind business off of Sears Island. Not only does it already have existing rail infrastructure and a long history of working in energy and construction but crucially, the engineering firm also found that siting the assembly facility there would shave years off the permitting and construction timetable for making floating offshore wind a reality.</p><p>Legally, this alternative matters, and federal regulators will decide who wins this fight. Maine regulators are expected to submit paperwork to begin the permitting process under the National Environmental Policy Act for building the assembly site at Sears Island in the coming weeks. As they do so, they will be required to explain how this plan offers the “least environmentally damaging practicable alternative” under environmental law. And Bennett is confident their claims will not pass muster in court, if not with career EPA staff.</p><p>“It cannot be legally permitted,” she confessed. “We will sue them.” </p><p>So I sought out to answer this pesky question: Why is Maine trying to build this crucial infrastructure for the energy transition in a place with activist resistance, and where even its own consultants have said the process would take longer? </p><p>State regulators, politicians, and supporters of the Sears Island plan have a few reasons. First off, Maine Governor Janet Mills has bemoaned that to use Mack Point would require leasing the property from Sprague, which would mean a recurring cost to taxpayers. There are also size issues — the Maine Department of Transportation claims there simply wouldn’t be enough space at Mack Point for researchers and, eventually, industry to do their work. </p><p>“We know there would be environmental impacts at both the Mack Point and Sears Island sites,” Paul Merrill, director of communications for the Maine Department of Transportation, told me in an email Monday evening. “The bottom line is that the port Maine needs simply doesn’t fit at Mack Point. Sprague has a financial interest in development on Mack Point. Our goal is to develop a port that is in the best interest of the public.”</p><p>Merrill did acknowledge the new proposal for Sears Island would be located on “the same part of the island that was discussed for development in the 1990s.” </p><p>Sprague denies the logistical issues with building the port at Mack Point and told me issues Maine regulators are easily resolved. The company has begun campaigning to win key stakeholders to its side, publishing op-eds and meeting with environmental advocates. On September 12, Sierra Club’s Maine chapter hosted a virtual event with a Sprague executive, Jim Theriault, about how the port selection “needs to be considered carefully.” When I spoke to Theriault this week, he told me that Sierra Club members were asking the same question I was. </p><p>“At the end of the day, we’d be reusing an industrial site, and we’d relocate what we do to other parts of the terminal,” he said. “I’ll make myself available to anybody that wants to talk.” </p>

## Battery Fears Hit Nebraska and New York

<strong>1. Cass County, Nebraska</strong> — Local permits for a 260+ megawatt NextEra solar project have been stalled for at least two months, we can exclusively report.
</p><ul>
<li>The Cass County Planning Commission held a <a href="https://www.casscountyne.gov/utility/openPDF/cacone/Special_Meeting_agenda_-_September_23__2024_-_NextEra_Energy_Solar_application_for_Cass_County.pdf?alt=media" target="_blank"><u>special meeting Monday</u></a> on NextEra’s application for the project. Meeting minutes aren’t public yet and a record of the gathering may not be public until at least next week, but staff in the county zoning office confirmed with me on the phone that commissioners tabled the application for 60 days.</li>
<li>Why was it tabled? According to one anti-NextEra attendee’s post to Facebook, it was NextEra’s desire to add battery storage to the project. “Voters and commission members jumped all over him about [how] unsafe these lithium ion batteries are and, if they catch on fire, how they are nearly impossible to extinguish,” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/stopsolarfarms/permalink/1740759476692146/?rdid=DybTSvBJz1rxHFN4&share_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fshare%2Fp%2FDuwe3gRmH7KCsfJD%2F" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wrote</u></a> Dave Begley of Omaha, Nebraska. “The Commission tabled the application over concerns about batteries.” </li>
<li>Cass County has restricted solar development before, passing <a href="https://chsprowl.org/3170/news/cass-county-commissioners-vote-on-solar-project/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an ordinance</u></a> in 2023 with property distance requirements. A NextEra project developer <a href="https://energynews.us/2023/06/30/arrival-of-large-scale-solar-projects-in-nebraska-met-with-resistance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told <em>Energy News Network</em></u></a> last year 40%-50% of the acreage it has leased for the project would be for setbacks from roads, drainage, and trees. </li>
<li>This upper-middle class, white, and conservative community outside of Omaha is also predicted to be a relatively difficult place to build a renewable energy project, based on Heatmap Pro’s modeling of polling, demographic, and economic data. Strong opposition to battery storage, in particular, was likely:</li></ul><hr/><ul>

## CrowdStrike executive apologizes to Congress for July global tech outage

date: 2024-09-25, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — An executive at cybersecurity company CrowdStrike apologized in testimony to Congress for sparking a global technology outage over the summer. 


"We let our customers down," said Adam Meyers, who leads CrowdStrike's threat intelligence division, in a hearing before a U.S. House cybersecurity subcommittee Tuesday. 


Austin, Texas-based CrowdStrike has blamed a bug in an update that allowed its cybersecurity systems to push bad data out to millions of customer computers, setting off a global tech outage in July that grounded flights, took TV broadcasts off air and disrupted banks, hospitals and retailers. 




"Everywhere Americans turned, basic societal functions were unavailable," House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green said. "We cannot allow a mistake of this magnitude to happen again." 


The Tennessee Republican likened the impact of the outage to an attack "we would expect to be carefully executed by a malicious and sophisticated nation-state actor." 


"We're deeply sorry and we are determined to prevent this from ever happening again," Meyers told lawmakers while laying out the technical missteps that led to the outage of about 8.5 million computers running Microsoft's Windows operating system. 


Meyers said he wanted to "underscore that this was not a cyberattack" but was, instead, caused by a faulty "rapid-response content update" focused on addressing new threats. The company has since bolstered its content update procedures, he said. 


The company still faces a number of lawsuits from people and businesses that were caught up in July's mass outage.

## Do Community Benefit Agreements Actually Work?

date: 2024-09-25, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY4NjIzMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyOTU4Njg1Nn0.232LH79aQiwVow0-7ortWAPWVX7GafZkJpUll_ixokE/image.jpg?width=900&height=410&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">This week I spoke with Matilda Krieder, a researcher at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, about a database she and her colleagues <a href="https://windexchange.energy.gov/projects/community-benefit-agreements" target="_blank"><u>released this week</u></a> showing how onshore and offshore wind developers use community benefit agreements – a form of compact aimed at improving local benefits from projects. We talked about whether communities really see the agreements as helpful or if there’s a better way.<br/></p>
<p>The following is an abridged version of our conversation edited for clarity and space: </p>
<p><strong>How much have you heard from people concerned that community benefit agreements are a form of financial influence or a false promise where they don’t receive real benefits?</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>I haven’t heard very much about the not-receiving end of things — and the reason I’ll say that is at least on the land-based wind side, an actual community benefit agreement is pretty uncommon. The vast majority of the time it’s just donations. And that, I think, is less likely to have the false promise thing because developers are handing over a one-time check, so there’s not really a perception that it won’t come to fruition. </p>
<p><strong>So walk me through what your research shows with respect to how effective community benefit agreements are in assuaging local opposition to a project?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately my research is not super helpful there. Because we didn’t look at failed projects, I don’t think I can say anything about whether [community benefit agreements] help or not. </p>
<p>But the existing literature that other people have done is not really positive on the connection between community benefits and improving community perception of projects, which is really interesting to me because I think people in the U.S. are really buying into it. Especially for offshore wind. So much pressure is being put on community benefits agreements as the thing that’ll change everything. And I support developers giving them, even if it doesn’t change anything, because it’s a net good. But I do wonder if developers or anybody setting regulations are reading what’s been studied. If so, I don’t know if they’d be putting all their eggs in this basket. </p>
<p><strong>Okay then what if you walked me through the benefits you’ve found, at least in wind? </strong></p>
<p>So it’s very different from offshore wind to land-based wind. In offshore wind, we’re seeing huge amounts of money, especially in the communities that host cable landings for the projects, because that’s the only point in offshore wind where the local government has any way to stop or change the way the project is developed. The cable landing is where you’re seeing $150 million [contributions]. And that hasn’t been happening long enough to measure the impacts of school funding or taxes over time. </p>
<p>The agreements that are more likely to be impactful are the ones that are more specific. I point to the Salem offshore wind terminal as a positive example because it’s such specific funding. You can tell they did the work to understand what the community’s priorities were and they directed funding to those areas. </p>
<p>In terms of land-based wind, it would be up to who you talk to. I’ve talked to county commissioners who’ve spoken really positively about the things that would be considered small potatoes. Not millions of dollars but directed funding in a specific way that met the community’s priorities and that changed people’s perception of the project. That’s a very small sample size, so you can’t identify a trend there, but I think it has potential. </p>
<p>I’m starting to view the donation side more positively than a lot of people too because a community benefit agreement most of the time is going to the local government, [and] a lot of people distrust their local government. </p>
<p><strong>So instead, donations directly to services instead of county or local governments? </strong></p>
<p>Yeah. That’s just a function of how in agreements, 95% of the funding goes to a local government. And people may not ever know what happens to it after that. It’s less visible. </p>
<p><strong>What are you hearing from communities about community benefit agreements then? </strong></p>
<p>I hear, <em><em>how do we get one? </em></em>The problem is, it’s still entirely in the developers’ hands so sometimes I feel a bit limited in the advice I can give to get one. It kind of comes down to what leverage you have with a developer. </p>

## China 'firmly opposes' proposed ban on connected vehicles

date: 2024-09-25, from: VOA News USA

Washington — On Wednesday, China’s commerce ministry said it “firmly opposes” the United States’ proposed ban on the sale of connected vehicles that use Chinese or Russian software and hardware technology. 


Most new vehicles are considered to be “connected” because they can share data with other vehicles and infrastructure with the help of onboard software, hardware and internet access.  


The U.S. warns that data collected by Chinese or Russian software in connected and autonomous vehicles could pose a threat to national security. 


A spokesperson from China’s Ministry of Commerce said the proposed U.S. ban has no “factual basis, violates the principles of market economy and fair competition, and is a typical protectionist act.”   


“China urges the United States to stop its wrong practice of generalizing national security, immediately revoke the relevant restrictions, and stop its unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies,” according to a ministry statement. 


The proposed rule is the latest example of the deteriorating relationship between Washington and Beijing.   


In February, the Biden Administration said it would probe Chinese cars that pose a risk to national security. The U.S. Department of Commerce said it opened the probe because vehicles “collect large amounts of sensitive data on their drivers and passengers (and) regularly use their cameras and sensors to record detailed information on U.S. infrastructure.” 


The Biden Administration also implemented a 100% tariff on Chinese-made EVs earlier this month, citing unfair business practices and the potential for Chinese EVs to flood international markets. 


The new proposed prohibition on connected vehicles applies both to the software and hardware that link vehicles to the outside world. It did not specify which manufacturers are likely to be impacted by the rule, which will be finalized after a 30-day period for public comment.  


In a press release Tuesday, the Coalition for a Prosperous America, or CPA, voiced its support for the proposed ban. 


“For years, the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] has aggressively pursued global dominance in the automotive industry building tremendous overcapacity to dominate their home market and to displace auto manufacturing worldwide,” said the CEO of CPA, Michael Stumo. 


“The Commerce Department’s proposed ban on this technology is an important measure to protect our automotive sector and secure Americans’ sensitive information,” he added. 


China’s commerce ministry also condemned the U.S. on Wednesday for its newly proposed ban and tariffs implemented earlier this month, saying Washington placed "high tariffs on Chinese cars, restricted participation in government procurement, and introduced discriminatory subsidy policies."  


“Now, on the grounds of so-called national security, it [Washington] has slandered Chinese connected car software, hardware and complete vehicles as 'unsafe' and restricted their use in the United States,” a ministry statement said. 


Some information for this report came from  Agence France-Presse.

## What happened to the Japanese PC platforms?

date: 2024-09-25, from: OS News

The other day a friend asked me a pretty interesting question: what happened to all those companies who made those Japanese computer platforms that were never released outside Japan? I thought it’d be worth expanding that answer into a full-size post. ↫ Misty De Meo Japan had a number of computer makers that sold platforms that looked and felt like western PCs, but were actually quite different hardware-wise, and incompatible with the IBM PC. None of these exist anymore today, and the reason is simple: Windows 95. The Japanese platforms compatible enough with the IBM PC that they could get a Windows 95 port turned into a commodity with little to distinguish them from regular IBM PCs, and the odd platform that didn&#8217;t use an x86 chip at all &#8211; like the X68000 &#8211; didn&#8217;t get a Windows port and thus just died off. The one platform mentioned in this article that I had never heard of was FM Towns, made by Fujitsu, which had its own graphical operating system called Towns OS. The FM Towns machines and the Towns OS were notable and unique at the time in that it was the first operating system to boot from CD-ROM, and it just so happens that Joe Groff published an article earlier this year detailing this boot process, including a custom bootable image he made. Here in the west we mostly tend to remember the PC-98 and X86000 platforms for their gaming catalogs and stunning designs, but that&#8217;s like only remembering the IBM PC for its own gaming catalog. These machines weren&#8217;t just glorified game consoles &#8211; they were full-fledged desktop computers used for the same boring work stuff we used the IBM PC for, and it truly makes me sad I don&#8217;t speak a single character of Japanese, so a unique operating system like Towns OS will always remain a curiosity for me.

## OpenBSD now enforcing no invalid NUL characters in shell scripts

date: 2024-09-25, from: OS News

Our favorite operating system is now changing the default shell (ksh) to enforce not allowing invalid NUL characters in input that will be parsed as parts of the script. ↫ Undeadly.org As someone who doesn&#8217;t deal with stuff like this &#8211; I rarely actively use shell scripts &#8211; it seems kind of insane to me that this wasn&#8217;t the norm since the beginning.

## Why FEMA Is Teaming Up with the NFL

date: 2024-09-25, from: Heatmap News

<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> Large hail stones pelted Oklahoma City • A month’s worth of rain fell over 24 hours in parts of England, with more rain on the way • A wildfire is raging near the capital of Ecuador, which is experiencing the worst drought in six decades.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Biden touts his climate legacy at Climate Week</h3><p>
	President Biden touted his administration's climate legacy yesterday at the Bloomberg Global Business forum as part of Climate Week. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kkc-jCet3lA&ab_channel=CNBC&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--CvNGZhyGfchpqpPFlwncL8Xdb7l5BFE2Hpm5WlzvTNRkhKPivmMnuUcm3jyhmvdFjp2eY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">speech</a> was a comprehensive list of his climate and clean energy accomplishments, starting with the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden called the most significant climate law ever passed in the history of the world. “We were told it couldn’t get done but we did it,” he said. He tied climate policy to economic growth and job creation. “In just two years since the Inflation Reduction Act, we’ve created more than 330,000 clean energy jobs,” he said. Some other crowd pleasers from the speech:
</p><ul>
<li>Companies have announced “nearly $1 trillion of investments in U.S. clean energy manufacturing over the last three years.”</li>
<li>The U.S. is on track to “add more electric capacity this year than in the last two decades, and 96% of that will be clean energy.”</li>
<li>“American solar panel manufacturing is up four times what it was four years ago.” </li>
</ul><p>
	Biden closed his remarks with a warning that former President Donald Trump would undo much of this progress if elected again in November. He urged the business leaders in the room to keep the momentum going. “It’s a perfect time to go big. The market for clean energy is booming … I’m doing my part and I’m calling on other companies and the capital in the room to invest more and do more. Now’s the time. We can do this. We really can. We owe it to our children.”
</p><h3>2. Evacuations begin ahead of Hurricane Helene</h3><p>
	Tropical Storm Helene is <a href="https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2024-09-25-hurricane-tropical-storm-helene-forecast-florida-southeast?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--CvNGZhyGfchpqpPFlwncL8Xdb7l5BFE2Hpm5WlzvTNRkhKPivmMnuUcm3jyhmvdFjp2eY" target="_blank">forecast</a> to <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?start&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--CvNGZhyGfchpqpPFlwncL8Xdb7l5BFE2Hpm5WlzvTNRkhKPivmMnuUcm3jyhmvdFjp2eY#contents" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">strengthen</a> into a large, major hurricane later today and make landfall on Florida’s Gulf Coast tomorrow.

</p><h3>3. NFL and FEMA partner to turn football stadiums into disaster shelters</h3><p>
	The NFL and the Federal Emergency Management Agency are partnering to make football stadiums available as emergency disaster shelters year-round, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/09/25/nfl-stadium-shelters-disasters-fema/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--CvNGZhyGfchpqpPFlwncL8Xdb7l5BFE2Hpm5WlzvTNRkhKPivmMnuUcm3jyhmvdFjp2eY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> <em>The Washington Post</em>. The NFL reportedly approached FEMA with the idea three years ago. “It just made perfect sense,” said FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell. “We have all of these existing venues. How do we better coordinate during these blue sky days to better understand what they bring to the table and what we can use them for in the future?” Three stadiums are already on board: New York’s MetLife Stadium, Pittsburgh’s Acrisure Stadium, and Tampa’s Raymond James Stadium. The <em><em>Post</em></em> reported that L.A.’s SoFi Stadium is expected to sign on soon, and Criswell hopes the MLB and other sports leagues will also join the initiative.
</p><h3>4. Study: Europe must balance ‘ambition with adaptability’ to meet climate goals</h3><p>
	European Union emissions targets “often lack the flexibility necessary for effective decarbonization at the national level,” according to a <a href="https://www.carbonfreeeurope.org/modelling?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--CvNGZhyGfchpqpPFlwncL8Xdb7l5BFE2Hpm5WlzvTNRkhKPivmMnuUcm3jyhmvdFjp2eY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> released today by Third Way’s Carbon-Free Europe and Evolved Energy Research. By mapping existing clean energy infrastructure for each member state “down to each kilometer,” the researchers found that “hitting sector- and tech-specific deployment targets does not necessarily equate to hitting emissions targets,” Lindsey Walter, the co-founder of the Carbon-Free Europe initiative, told Heatmap.
</p><p>
	For example, the report found that EU policy needs to be more aggressive in deploying solar energy, while other 2030 targets, such as clean hydrogen, are likely to outpace demand as the transport and industry uses continue to develop and petroleum refineries, one of the primary uses today, are in decline. By looking more deeply at various net-zero pathways for each member state, the report proposes a “more flexible framework” for keeping countries competitive via individualized net-zero strategies. “Ultimately, we think the future energy mix will be determined strictly by economics,” Walter said. “What our study is finding is that land use trade-offs will likely be just as big — if not a bigger — factor in the ultimate energy mix in Europe.” Particularly in countries like the U.K., France, and Italy, there is the potential for significant on- and off-shore wind and solar in some of the models: “We’re not talking about building the next 10 wind or solar farms — we’re talking about the next 1,000,” Walter went on. “And it is quite significant when you look at it on the ground.”
</p><h3>5. Climate change contributed to recent European floods</h3><p>
	In case there was any doubt, researchers from World Weather Attribution <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-and-high-exposure-increased-costs-and-disruption-to-lives-and-livelihoods-from-flooding-associated-with-exceptionally-heavy-rainfall-in-central-europe/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--CvNGZhyGfchpqpPFlwncL8Xdb7l5BFE2Hpm5WlzvTNRkhKPivmMnuUcm3jyhmvdFjp2eY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that climate change contributed to the severity of the heavy rain and flooding that Storm Boris brought to central Europe this month. The group analyzed climate models and historical data and found that human-caused climate change has made rainfall events like these twice as likely and 20% more intense since the pre-industrial era. The rain was “by far the heaviest ever recorded” in the area, and left at least 24 people dead. “Yet again, these floods highlight the devastating results of fossil fuel-driven warming,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-25/climate-change-made-europe-s-deadly-floods-worse-and-more-likely?srnd=green&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--CvNGZhyGfchpqpPFlwncL8Xdb7l5BFE2Hpm5WlzvTNRkhKPivmMnuUcm3jyhmvdFjp2eY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Joyce Kimutai, a researcher at Imperial College London and one of the contributors to the report.
</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p>
<em>“A lot of energy performance improvements to houses right now are on sale, and they're going to be on sale until the end of the decade.”</em> –Eric Werling, former national director of the Department of Energy’s Zero Energy Ready Homes program, <a href="https://heatmap.news/decarbonize-your-life/energy-efficient-renovation?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--CvNGZhyGfchpqpPFlwncL8Xdb7l5BFE2Hpm5WlzvTNRkhKPivmMnuUcm3jyhmvdFjp2eY" rel="noopener" target="_self">speaking to Heatmap’s Katie Brigham</a> about the benefits of home weatherization.

## Secret Service failures before Trump rally shooting were 'preventable,' Senate panel finds

date: 2024-09-25, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Multiple Secret Service failures ahead of the July rally for former President Donald Trump where a gunman opened fire were "foreseeable, preventable, and directly related to the events resulting in the assassination attempt that day," according to a bipartisan Senate investigation released Wednesday. 


Similar to the agency's own internal investigation and an ongoing bipartisan House probe, the interim report from the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee found multiple failures on almost every level ahead of the Butler, Pennsylvania shooting, including in planning, communications, security and allocation of resources. 


"The consequences of those failures were dire," said Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, the Democratic chairman of the Homeland panel. 




Investigators found that there was no clear chain of command among the Secret Service and other security agencies and no plan for coverage of the building where the shooter climbed up to fire the shots. Officials were operating on multiple, separate radio channels, leading to missed communications, and an inexperienced drone operator was stuck on a help line after his equipment wasn't working correctly. 


Communications among security officials were a "multi-step game of telephone," Peters said. 




The report found the Secret Service was notified about an individual on the roof of the building approximately two minutes before shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire, firing eight rounds in Trump's direction less than 150 yards from where the former president was speaking. Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, was struck in the ear by a bullet or a bullet fragment in the assassination attempt, one rallygoer was killed and two others were injured before the gunman was killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper. 


Approximately 22 seconds before Crooks fired, the report found, a local officer sent a radio alert that there was an armed individual on the building. But that information was not relayed to key Secret Service personnel who were interviewed by Senate investigators. 


The panel also interviewed a Secret Service counter-sniper who reported seeing officers with their guns drawn running toward the building where the shooter was perched, but the person said they did not think to notify anyone to get Trump off the stage. 


The Senate report comes just days after the Secret Service released a five-page document summarizing the key conclusions of a yet-to-be finalized Secret Service report on what went wrong, and ahead of a Thursday hearing that will be held by a bipartisan House task force investigating the shooting. The House panel is also investigating a second assassination attempt on Trump earlier this month when Secret Service agents arrested a man with a rifle hiding on the golf course at Trump's Florida club. 


Each investigation has found new details that reflect a massive breakdown in the former president's security, and lawmakers say there is much more they want to find out as they try to prevent it from happening again. 


"This was the result of multiple human failures of the Secret Service," said Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, the top Republican on the panel. 


The senators recommended that the Secret Service better define roles and responsibilities before any protective event, including by designating a single individual in charge of approving all the security plans. Investigators found that many of the people in charge denied that they had responsibility for planning or security failures, and deflected blame. 


Advance agents interviewed by the committee said "that planning and security decisions were made jointly, with no specific individual responsible for approval," the report said. 


Communication with local authorities was also poor. Local law enforcement had raised concern two days earlier about security coverage of the building where the shooter perched, telling Secret Service agents during a walk through that they did not have the manpower to lock it down. Secret Service agents then gave investigators conflicting accounts about who was responsible for that security coverage, the report said. 


The internal review released last week by the Secret Service also detailed multiple communications breakdowns, including an absence of clear guidance to local law enforcement and the failure to fix line-of-sight vulnerabilities at the rally grounds that left Trump open to sniper fire and "complacency" among some agents. 


"This was a failure on the part of the United States Secret Service. It's important that we hold ourselves to account for the failures of July 13th and that we use the lessons learned to make sure that we do not have another failure like this again," said Ronald Rowe Jr., the agency's acting director, after the report was released. 


In addition to better defining responsibility for events, the senators recommended that the agency completely overhaul its communications operations at protective events and improve intelligence sharing. They also recommended that Congress evaluate whether more resources are needed. 


Democrats and Republicans have disagreed on whether to give the Secret Service more money in the wake of its failures. A spending bill on track to pass before the end of the month includes an additional $231 million for the agency, but many Republicans have said that an internal overhaul is needed first. 


"This is a management problem plain and simple," said Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the top Republican on the Homeland panel's investigations subcommittee.

	It’s potentially one of the most important — but least understood — provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, and it’s finally out in the world. Last month, the Environmental Protection Agency spent $27 billion to set up new green banks across the country.
</p><p>
	These new lending institutions could direct billions of dollars to supercharging decarbonization nationwide, financing new solar farms, geothermal projects, EV chargers, and more. They’ll also recycle their funding indefinitely, meaning they will likely last longer than any other provision in the law.
</p><p>
	On this week’s show, Rob and Jesse bring you a user’s guide to these new green banks and what they might mean for decarbonization. The episode features two conversations: First, Rob speaks with Jahi Wise, the former director for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund program at the Environmental Protection Agency.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins:</strong> We’ve talked for a long time about this “<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/rivian-earnings-r2-release" target="_self"><u>valley of death</u></a>” that companies face as they reach that scale-up phase where they’re coming out of the phase where they’re trying to just prove the technology works and de-risk it and into the phase where they have to deploy at scale and need project financing for that, or they need to build factories to get to economies of scale to produce their product at a competitive cost. And that burns a lot of capital, both, direct equity investment in the company and project finance and loans to get projects built and online. Is that the real gap that you’re seeing right now?<br/>
<br/>
	It seems like we’ve had such a big wave of venture capital coming into this space over the last few years that there are a lot of really well capitalized companies through series A or B, but now they’re … you know, if they were stood up two, three, four years ago, now they’re coming into this new phase. Is that where you’re trying to position your fund? And maybe more broadly, the green banks that were supported by GGRF?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dawn Lippert: </strong>Yes — I think, overall, yes. And it’s nuanced. So what we’re seeing is, we published a report earlier this year that there’s essentially this financing gap, if you can think of it that way, or the valley is at least $150 billion, where companies are going from exactly what you said of venture capital-backed and then need other kinds of financing.<br/>
<br/>
	And then on the other side of the gap, there’s actually a lot more financing than ever.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah, tons. Infrastructure funds and others, right?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lippert: </strong>Yes, absolutely. And so it’s really about building this bridge and being really smart about that. So I would say there’s a couple of things. One is that we see three main issues to crossing the bridge. One is capital. We’ve talked about that, and I’ll talk about a little bit more. The second is project expertise — companies going from technology companies to project companies. I would say that’s one of the key things that we see as being a real challenge and also a huge opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
	And Rob, you talked about talent coming into this space. That tidal wave really changed in 2018 when the skies turned orange over San Francisco. We just saw so much talent coming in from tech, and it just hasn’t stopped. It really kept flowing. But this project expertise of operational expertise — how you develop, how you permit and get entitlements, how you structure the financing, but also just do the actual construction of projects — we need to build so many things. That’s where we see a huge need. And we did a recent analysis with our partners at Vibrant Data Labs and found that only about less than 30% of companies in climate right now have project expertise or deep project expertise on their team to build stuff.<br/>
<br/>
	So that’s a place where Elemental has leaned in a ton where we were dropping CFOs and fractional CFOs and developers and residents and all kinds of folks to help fill that gap. But there’s a huge amount of work that needs to be done there. </blockquote><div class="horizontal-rule"></div><p>This episode of Shift Key is sponsored by …</p><p><strong>Watershed</strong>’s climate data engine helps companies measure and reduce their emissions, turning the data they already have into an audit-ready carbon footprint backed by the latest climate science.

## Helene becomes hurricane, is expected to intensify as it moves toward Florida

date: 2024-09-25, from: VOA News USA

TALLAHASSEE, Florida — Helene became a hurricane Wednesday after rapidly strengthening in the Caribbean Sea and moved north along Mexico's coast on a path toward the U.S., leading residents to evacuate, schools to close, and officials to declare emergencies in Florida and Georgia. 


The storm's center was near Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Wednesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said, and it was expected to intensify and grow in size as it crosses the Gulf of Mexico. Heavy rainfall was forecast for the southeastern U.S. starting Wednesday, with a life-threatening storm surge along the entire west coast of Florida, according to the center. 


The storm is so large that rural areas roughly 145 kilometers (90 miles) north of the Georgia-Florida line are under a hurricane warning. And states as far inland as Tennessee, Kentucky and Indiana could see rainfall. 


"You are going to have a major hurricane plowing inland, and storms take a little time to decay once they're inland," said Brian McNoldy, an environmental researcher at the University of Miami. 


Forecasters warned of possible tornadoes Wednesday night in western Florida and southern Alabama and said the tornado risk would increase Thursday, expanding across Florida and into Georgia and South Carolina. 




Helene is expected to become a major hurricane — a Category 3 or higher, with winds above 177 kph (110 mph) — on Thursday, the day it's set to reach Florida's Gulf Coast, according to the hurricane center. The center issued hurricane warnings for part of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and Florida's northwestern coastline, where large storm surges of up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) were expected. 


Will Marx hunkered down Wednesday in his double-wide mobile home 21 kilometers (13 miles) inland in Crawfordville, Florida. The 64-year-old retiree put extra jugs of water in his freezer as he watched people move boats and RVs out of the storm's projected path. 


"We will know tomorrow, I guess," he said. 


Mexico is still reeling from former Hurricane John battering its other coast. John hit the country's southern Pacific coast late Monday, killing two people, blowing tin roofs off houses, triggering mudslides and toppling scores of trees, officials said Tuesday. 


John grew into a Category 3 hurricane in a matter of hours Monday and made landfall about 128 kilometers (80 miles) east of the resort city of Acapulco, near the town of Punta Maldonado, with maximum sustained winds of 193 kph (120 mph) before weakening to a tropical storm after moving inland. 


Helene, which formed Tuesday in the Caribbean, is expected to move over deep, warm waters, fueling its intensification. The hurricane was about 810 kilometers (503 miles) southwest of Tampa, Florida, and had sustained winds of 130 kph (81 mph), according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. Forecasters said it is expected to become a major hurricane with its center making landfall in the Big Bend area of Florida's northwestern coast as soon as late Thursday. 


Mara Lezama, the governor of the coastal state of Quintana Roo, shared photos of rain-swept streets and videos of the normally placid, turquoise waters off the island of Cozumel being whipped into angry waves that broke over the seawall. In Cancun, heavy waves threatened to worsen the resort city's problem with beach erosion. 


Tropical storm warnings were in effect for the upper Florida Keys, southern Florida and the northeast coast of Florida and were extended northward Wednesday morning to Altamaha Sound, Georgia. A tropical storm watch was in effect for the South Carolina coast north of the South Santee River to Little River Inlet. 


Hurricane watches, which are a step down from warnings, were also in effect for parts of western Cuba and Florida, including the Tampa Bay area, the hurricane center said. 




Several counties on Florida's west and northwestern coasts have issued evacuation orders, and schools planned to close or reduce hours. Gas stations in the Tallahassee area started to run out of gas Monday, and water and other supplies flew from supermarket shelves. 


President Joe Biden declared an emergency in Florida, and federal authorities positioned generators, food and water, along with search-and-rescue and power restoration teams. 


Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who already issued an emergency for most of the state's counties, said Wednesday that 12 health care facilities have evacuated. He urged people to prepare immediately. 


Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also declared an emergency in his state. The hurricane warning area included Valdosta, a city of 55,000. Helene approached barely a year after Hurricane Idalia inflicted more than $6 million in damage to 1,000 homes and other property. 


In western Cuba, authorities moved cattle to higher ground and seven medical brigades were dispatched to communities usually cut off by storms. Helene was expected to dump heavy rain on the western part of an island already struggling with severe water shortages and chronic power outages. 


The Cayman Islands were recovering after they were lashed Tuesday with heavy rains and big waves. The strong winds knocked out power in some areas, while heavy rain and waves as high as 3 meters (10 feet) unleashed flooding. Schools on the islands remained closed Wednesday as flood warnings continued and residents pumped water out of their flooded homes. 


Helene is the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1. Since 2000, eight major hurricanes have made landfall in Florida, according to Philip Klotzbach, a Colorado State University hurricane researcher. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-average Atlantic hurricane season this year because of record-warm ocean temperatures.

## US Congresswoman Kamlager-Dove condemns inaction on Sudan conflict

date: 2024-09-25, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Fifty Democratic members of Congress sent a letter to President Joe Biden in late August requesting more humanitarian assistance for Sudan and calling on the U.S. to do more to help end the conflict. Leading the effort is U.S. Representative Sydney Kamlager-Dove of California, who told VOA in a recent interview that she is concerned that international partners aren’t doing enough to support humanitarian aid delivery to families affected by the conflict.


“Famine has erupted. Deaths are happening every day, and the warring parties are working together, in my opinion, to prevent the delivery of humanitarian aid,” she told VOA. “It is unconscionable. And it is inhumane.”


Without more aggressive leadership by the U.S., she said, the conflict risks international neglect amid the war Ukraine and an expanding conflict in the Middle East.


The following has been edited for length and clarity.


VOA: Your colleagues have joined you to raise awareness about Sudan. A lot of Sudanese who spoke to us say the world has forgotten them. How do you feel about their sentiments?


U.S. Representative Sydney Kamlager-Dove: I am disheartened to hear that, but I understand why they would say it, and that is exactly why I wrote this letter and encouraged my colleagues to sign on. Fifty Democratic members of Congress signed with me, to ask this administration to do more. We want them to raise awareness of this war. Get [U.S.] Secretary [of State Anthony] Blinken out in front. We want to rally our international partners to also take this more seriously and pledge more dollars to help with the support around humanitarian aid delivery. Because if we are not taking the lead on this, then it will signal to the rest of the world that this is not important and of course it is.


VOA: What about international attention? Are you getting that?


Kamlager-Dove: No, we're not getting [international attention.] I have my own suspicions that people just don’t care, or don’t respect the continent of Africa. I think that is wildly ignorant. And we know with forces like China and Russia working to compete against us [the U.S.], and to dismantle democracies, we know that there are other agents and actors playing in this war as well. That is why it is incumbent upon us to take the lead and call for more aid and call for more discussions.


VOA: What about America’s foreign policy and its resources? Where does it go? I mean, I know that the war in Ukraine and Gaza is shifting attention.


Kamlager-Dove: Thankfully, we have an administration that is trying to engage. They finally got a special envoy, [Former U.S. Representative Tom Perriello], to Sudan. You know, a year too late, but he needs to be supported with more resources and more staff. It is very important that Secretary Blinken shows his face more on the continent and reminds folks that this administration cares.


VOA: The U.N. made an appeal for humanitarian assistance. They were projecting $2.7 billion and only 37% of that was received. What should be done to get pledges from donor countries?


Kamlager-Dove: Well, I do think we have to make a concerted effort to ask the international community to pledge more. It is important to give more, but if those resources are thwarted because you have bad actors keeping humanitarian aid from the people and the civilians that need it the most, then it doesn't matter.


VOA: The U.S. government slapped sanctions on both sides in Sudan — the Rapid Support Forces [RSF] and some leaders of the Sudan Armed Forces [SAF]. And it appears like these sanctions are not biting hard because the two belligerent forces have decided not to sign any cease-fire. Are there other instruments of diplomacy in the toolbox that is yet to be used to bring pressure on these two groups?


Kamlager-Dove: Well, it is certainly unfortunate that neither party wants to show up to the negotiating table. It's very hard to come to a resolution when you don't even sit at the table. The other thing that is unfortunate is even if you have sanctions, you know, if you’re still able to buy guns and get the weapons into the country, then obviously you need different kinds of teeth and authority. I think we should be looking at the folks who are supplying the arms to the forces, because that is as important as sanctioning both SAF and RSF. If you don’t stop the flow of arms, what are you really doing?


VOA: When Perriello testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he mentioned that those aiding the war in Sudan must be held accountable, or the U.S.'s efforts will be in vain. How do you respond to that?


Kamlager-Dove: I wholeheartedly agree. We have an obligation to focus on what is happening in the Sudan. But I want to say I'm grateful that he was actually able to show up. You know, we have not had a full committee hearing in the Foreign Affairs Committee on Africa since the beginning of this term.


VOA: The last time we heard about funding [for Sudan] was 2017. And just a month ago, nongovernmental organizations, international aid agencies are saying Darfur is on the verge of famine, there's famine already there. … If you are given an opportunity to speak directly to the people who are making decisions on where aid money should go, what would you tell them?


Kamlager-Dove: I would say the world is watching and the world is waiting. And every moment that you do not sit at the table and find a way, using any quiver that you have in your toolbox every day you wait is a day that someone dies in the Sudan. And this is not something that I am willing to keep in my heart. And this is not something that the United States should let happen. So, get off your tuchus (rear end) and find a way to bring about a cease-fire, and to make sure that humanitarian aid is able to get to the Sudan.


This Q&A originated in VOA’s English to Africa Service.

## Trump pledges sweeping tariffs, says they will keep jobs in US

date: 2024-09-25, from: VOA News USA

SAVANNAH, Ga.  — Donald Trump on Tuesday pledged to stop U.S. businesses from shipping jobs overseas and to take other countries' jobs and factories by relying heavily on sweeping tariffs to boost auto manufacturing — despite warnings that domestic consumers would pay more and a lack of specifics about how his plans would work.


"I want German car companies to become American car companies. I want them to build their plants here," Trump declared during a speech in Savannah, Georgia.


Trump added that, if elected, he'd put a 100% tariff on every car imported from Mexico and that the only way to avoid those charges would be for an automaker to build the cars in the U.S.


His ideas, if enacted, could cause a huge upheaval in the American auto industry. Many automakers now build smaller, lower-priced vehicles in Mexico — facilitated by a trade agreement Trump negotiated while president — or in other countries because their profit margins are slim. The lower labor costs help the companies make money on those vehicles.


German and other foreign automakers already have extensive manufacturing operations in the U.S., and many now build more vehicles here than they send. BMW, for instance, has an 8 million-square-foot campus in South Carolina that employs 11,000 people building more than 1,500 SUVs per day for the U.S. and 120 export markets. Mercedes and Volkswagen also have large factories here.


If German automakers were to increase production here, they likely would have to take it from factories in Germany, which then would run below their capacity and be less efficient, said Sam Abuelsamid, principal research analyst for Guidehouse Insights.


"It makes no sense," he said.


Trump proposes 'new American industrialism' — without specifics


Trump has proposed using tariffs on imports and other measures to boost American industry — even as economists have cautioned that U.S. consumers would bear the costs of tariffs and other Trump proposals like staging the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.


The former president laid out a broad array of economic proposals during a speech in the key swing state of Georgia, promising to create a special ambassador to help lure foreign manufacturers to the U.S. and further entice them by offering access to federal land.


Additionally, he called for lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate from 21% to 15%, but only for companies that produce in the U.S. Harris, the Democratic nominee, wants to raise the corporate tax rate to 28%. It had been 35% when Trump became president in 2017, and he later signed legislation lowering it.


"We're putting America first," Trump said. "This new American industrialism will create millions and millions of jobs."


Trump also suggested wiping away some environmental regulations to boost energy production, saying America has "got the oil, it's got the gas. We have everything. The only thing we don't have is smart people leading our country."


Tuesday's series of economic proposals raised a lot of questions, but the former president hasn't given specific answers on his ideas, which could substantially affect their impact and how much they cost. He has not specified, for example, whether his U.S.-focused corporate tax cuts would apply to companies that assemble their products domestically out of imports.


Trump also suggested he would use a newly created envoy, and his own personal efforts, to recruit foreign companies. But he had a spotty record in the White House of attracting foreign investment. In one infamous case, Trump promised a $10 billion investment by Taiwan-based electronics giant Foxconn in Wisconsin, creating potentially 13,000 new jobs, that the company never delivered.


His calls to offer federal land, meanwhile, might clash with Bureau of Land Management restrictions on foreign entities looking to lease lands. It also wasn't clear whether companies from China would be excluded, given Trump's longtime accusations that China is hurting American business.

## Man who staked out Trump at golf course charged with attempted assassination

date: 2024-09-25, from: VOA News USA

washington — A man who authorities say staked out Donald Trump for 12 hours on his golf course in Florida and wrote of his desire to kill him was indicted Tuesday on an attempted assassination charge. 


Ryan Wesley Routh had been initially charged with two federal firearms offenses. The upgraded charges contained in a five-count indictment reflect the Justice Department's assessment that he methodically plotted to kill the Republican nominee, aiming a rifle through the shrubbery surrounding Trump's West Palm Beach golf course on an afternoon Trump was playing on it. Routh left behind a note in which he described his intention, prosecutors said. 


Court records show the case has been assigned to Aileen Cannon, a Trump-appointed federal judge who generated intense scrutiny for her handling of a criminal case charging Trump with illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. She dismissed that case in July, a decision now being appealed by special counsel Jack Smith's team. 


The attempted assassination indictment had been foreshadowed during a court hearing Monday in which prosecutors successfully argued for the 58-year-old Routh to remain behind bars as a flight risk and a threat to public safety. 


They alleged that he had written of his plans to kill Trump in a handwritten note months before his September 15 arrest in which he referred to his actions as a failed "assassination attempt on Donald Trump" and offered $150,000 for anyone who could "finish the job." That note was in a box that Routh had apparently dropped off at the home of an unidentified witness months before his arrest. 


The person opened the letter, took a photograph of the front page of the letter, addressed "Dear World," and contacted law enforcement after the attempted assassination. 


Prosecutors also said Routh kept in his car a handwritten list of venues in August, September and October at which Trump had appeared or was expected to be present. 


The charge of attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate carries a potential life sentence in the event of a conviction.  


The potential shooting was thwarted when a member of Trump's Secret Service protective detail spotted a partially obscured man's face and a rifle barrel protruding through the golf course fence line, ahead of where Trump was playing.  


The arrest came two months after Trump was shot and wounded in the ear in an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The Secret Service has acknowledged failings leading up to that shooting but has said that security worked as it should have to thwart the potential attack in Florida. 


The initial charges Routh faced in a criminal complaint accused him of illegally possessing his gun in spite of multiple felony convictions and with possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. It is common for prosecutors to bring preliminary and easily provable charges upon an arrest and then add more serious offenses later as the investigation develops.

## Former executive gets 2 years in prison for role in FTX fraud

date: 2024-09-25, from: VOA News USA

new york — Caroline Ellison, a former top executive in Sam Bankman-Fried's fallen FTX cryptocurrency empire, was sentenced to two years in prison on Tuesday after she apologized repeatedly to everyone hurt by a fraud that stole billions of dollars from investors, lenders and customers. 


U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan said Ellison's cooperation was "very, very substantial" and "remarkable." 


But he said a prison sentence was necessary because she had participated in what might be the "greatest financial fraud ever perpetrated in this country and probably anywhere else" or at least close to it. 


He said in such a serious case, he could not let cooperation be a get-out-of-jail-free card, even when it was clear that Bankman-Fried had become "your kryptonite." 


"I've seen a lot of cooperators in 30 years here," he said. "I've never seen one quite like Ms. Ellison."




She was ordered to report to prison on November 7. 


Ellison, 29, pleaded guilty nearly two years ago and testified against Bankman-Fried for nearly three days at a trial last November. 


At sentencing, she emotionally apologized to anyone hurt by the fraud that stretched from 2017 through 2022. 


"I'm deeply ashamed with what I've done," she said, fighting through tears to say she was "so so sorry" to everyone she had harmed directly or indirectly. 


She did not speak as she left Manhattan federal court, surrounded by lawyers. 


In a court filing, prosecutors had called her testimony the "cornerstone of the trial" against Bankman-Fried, 32, who was found guilty of fraud and sentenced to 25 years in prison. 


In court Tuesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon called for leniency, saying her testimony was "devastating and powerful proof" against Bankman-Fried. 


The prosecutor said Ellison's time on the witness stand was very different from Bankman-Fried, who she said was "evasive, even contemptuous, and unable to answer questions directly" when he testified. 


Attorney Anjan Sahni asked the judge to spare his client from prison, citing "unusual circumstances," including her off-and-on romantic relationship with Bankman-Fried and the damage caused when her "whole professional and personal life came to revolve" around him. 


FTX was one of the world's most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, known for its Superbowl TV ad and its extensive lobbying campaign in Washington before it collapsed in 2022. 


U.S. prosecutors accused Bankman-Fried and other executives of looting customer accounts on the exchange to make risky investments, make millions of dollars of illegal political donations, bribe Chinese officials, and buy luxury real estate in the Caribbean. 


Ellison was chief executive at Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency hedge fund controlled by Bankman-Fried that was used to process some customer funds from FTX. 


As the business began to falter, Ellison divulged the massive fraud to employees who worked for her even before FTX filed for bankruptcy, trial evidence showed. 


Ultimately, she also spoke extensively with criminal and civil U.S. investigators. 


Sassoon said prosecutors were impressed that Ellison did not "jump into the lifeboat" to escape her crimes but instead spent nearly two years fully cooperating. 


Since testifying at Bankman-Fried's trial, Ellison has engaged in extensive charity work, written a novel, and worked with her parents on a math enrichment textbook for advanced high school students, according to her lawyers. 


They said she also now has a healthy romantic relationship and has reconnected with high school friends she had lost touch with while she worked for and sometimes dated Bankman-Fried from 2017 until late 2022.
