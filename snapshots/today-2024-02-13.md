## Germany goes on defense

date: 2024-02-13, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Earlier this morning, the Senate approved a $95 billion aid package for Israel and Ukraine. Meanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says Europe&#8217;s defense industries must switch toward arms productions. Manufacturers are struggling to meet demand for ammunition, as the war in Ukraine continues and fears of what another Donald Trump presidency could mean for U.S.-Europe security ties are renewed. Also: inflation lingers, and Airbnb adds yet another fee.</p>

## Clouds Over The Mines

date: 2024-02-13, from: David Rosenthal's blog

In early December 2022 when I wrote skeptically about the economics of Bitcoin mining in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/12/foolish-lenders.html"><i>Foolish Lenders</i></a> the Bitcoin "price" was around $17K. It has now climbed 153% to around $43K and, below the fold I am still posting skeptically about the economics of mining.<br />

The first clue that the future for miners is clouded comes in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-07/bitcoin-btc-price-outlook-clouded-by-falling-miner-reserves-before-halving"><i>Bitcoin Outlook Clouded by Falling Miner Reserves Ahead of April’s Halving</i></a> by Sidhartha Shukla and David Pan:<br />
<blockquote>
Bitcoin miners are getting a jump on an anticipated decline in revenue from the so-called halving in April, when the blockchain’s network protocol will reduce rewards for verifying transactions by half.<br />
<br />
Miner reserves — unsold Bitcoin held in digital wallets associated with the companies — have dropped by 8,400 tokens since the start of 2024 to 1.8 million, a level last seen in June 2021, according to data compiled by CryptoQuant. Analysts said the decrease indicates miners are selling tokens.
</blockquote>
The somewhat misleading graph of the miners HODL-ings actually shows only a 2% drop in the number of BTC from the peak in August 2022. But the "value" of those HODL-ings has risen 75% from $44.8B to $78.5B.
One way of looking at it is that the mining industry started August 2022 with 1.865M BTC and, in the 18 months since mined 821,250 BTC for a total of 2,686,250 but they now have only 1.825M BTC so they must have sold 861,250, or about 5% more than they mined.
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-07/bitcoin-btc-price-outlook-clouded-by-falling-miner-reserves-before-halving">Nevertheless</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
  “Miners have begun to sell more of their coins to bolster balance sheets and fund growth capex ahead of tougher times for margins when block rewards are halved in April,” said Matthew Sigel, head of digital-asset research at VanEck. “After the halving, scale will matter even more.”
</blockquote>
Before the great EFT pump, it was generally believed that the frantic efforts to pump BTC over $30K suggested that the mining industry's break-even point was around $30K. On 6<sup>th</sup> October BTC was $26K and the hash rate was around 412M TH/s. Lets assume that the industry was breaking even at BTC=$30K and a hash rate of 412MTH/s, so the industry's costs were covered by 45K BTC/month or $1.35B/month. Assuming the increase in efficiency is roughly cancelled by less efficient operators entering, the hash rate is now 527 TH/s and so costs are around $1.73B. But income is around $1.94B/month so margins are around 12%.<br />
<br />
After the halvening, income is 22.5K BTC/month. At BTC=$43K, this is $968K/month or 56% of current costs. To maintain a 12% margin, costs need to be cut to $852K/month, or 49% of current costs. Alternatively, if costs stay the same, the Bitcoin "price" needs to increase to $86 in April.<br />
<br />
The industry isn't going to halve its costs in the next three months, and even massive printing of unbacked Tether isn't going to double the BTC "price", so "tougher times for margins"  are certainly among the clouds overhead.<br />

I am not the only skeptic. Short-seller J Capital Research investigated Hut 8, a large public miner, and on January 18<sup>th</sup> published <a href="https://www.jcapitalresearch.com/uploads/2/0/0/3/20032477/2024_01_18_hut.pdf"><i>The Coming HUT Pump and Dump</i></a>. As the chart shows, it was effective. The report featured a list of 22 different red flags, focused mainly on the recent merger between Hut 8 (HUT) and U.S. Bitcoin Corp. (USBTC) and asking:<br />
<blockquote>
Why then did HUT pay $745 mln to acquire this company and its planned payments?
</blockquote>
This is a good question, given <a href="https://www.jcapitalresearch.com/uploads/2/0/0/3/20032477/2024_01_18_hut.pdf">that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
One person highly familiar with USBTC told us, “without the merger, [USBTC] would have done a structured bankruptcy.”
</blockquote>
It wasn't as if Hut 8 didn't have <a href="https://www.jcapitalresearch.com/uploads/2/0/0/3/20032477/2024_01_18_hut.pdf">problems of its own</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Hut 8’s North Bay mining facility has been non-operational for an extended period of time, and problems at its Drumheller facility “have been causing miners to fail.”
</blockquote>
And the result of the merger is a <a href="https://www.jcapitalresearch.com/uploads/2/0/0/3/20032477/2024_01_18_hut.pdf">company that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
has an industry-low efficiency rate and, post halving, will produce Bitcoin at a loss of close to $20,000 per Bitcoin at current spot prices.
</blockquote>
In other words, the merged company can barely make money now and cannot survive when the industry's income is halved in less than 3 months. This all looks like rats leaving the sinking ship with whatever they can carry. An impression reinforced by David Pan in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-07/bitcoin-miner-hut-8-hut-ceo-exits-three-weeks-after-short-seller-allegations"><i>Bitcoin Miner Hut 8 CEO Exits Three Weeks After Short-Seller Allegations </i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Hut 8 Corp., one of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies, named Asher Genoot to succeed Jaime Leverton as chief executive officer, three weeks after a short-seller released a report critical of its recent merger.<br />
<br />
The transition is effective immediately. Genoot served as the chief operating officer and the president of US Bitcoin Corp. Miami-based US Bitcoin, which has large-scale mining facilities across the US including Texas, completed its merger with then-Canadian miner Hut 8 in late 2023.<br />
<br />
The leadership transition comes amid increasing competition among the miners, a Bitcoin code update set to drastically reduce mining revenue in two months as well as the Jan. 18 report from short-seller J Capital Research alleging the merged company was a “pump and dump” waiting to happen. Hut 8 has disputed the claim.
</blockquote>
Genoot has <a href="https://www.jcapitalresearch.com/uploads/2/0/0/3/20032477/2024_01_18_hut.pdf">allegedly</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
abandoned several failed start-ups.
</blockquote>
His co-founder was USBTC's CEO and is now HUT's CSO/director <a href="https://www.jcapitalresearch.com/uploads/2/0/0/3/20032477/2024_01_18_hut.pdf">and</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
is a 30-year-old used-car salesman from Vancouver whose history is littered with involvement in SEC-defined pump-and-dumps, sporting share-price declines of 83%,
</blockquote>
The key inputs for profitable mining are low-cost power and state-of-the-art chips to use it as effficently as possible. Clouds are gathering over both of them.<br />
<br />
As regards access to cheap electricity, utilities are increasingly reluctant to provide it. Take, for example, 
<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/canada/crypto-mining-company-loses-bid-to-force-bc-hydro-to-provide-power/ar-BB1hPaZE"><i>Crypto mining company loses bid to force BC Hydro to provide power
</i></a> by Darryl Greer of The Canadian Press:<br />
<blockquote>
A cryptocurrency firm has lost a bid to force BC Hydro to provide the vast amounts of power needed for its operations, upholding the provincial government's right to pause power connections for new crypto miners. <br />
<br />
Conifex Timber Inc., a forestry firm that branched out into cryptocurrency mining, had gone to the B.C. Supreme Court to have the policy declared invalid.<br />
<br />
But Justice Michael Tammen ruled Friday that the government's move in December 2022 to pause new connections for cryptocurrency mining for 18 months was "reasonable" and not "unduly discriminatory."<br />
<br />
BC Hydro CEO Christopher O'Riley had told the court in an affidavit that the data centres proposed by Conifex would have consumed 2.5 million megawatt-hours of electricity each year. 
</blockquote>
In the US, David Pan's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-01/bitcoin-miners-in-us-consume-up-to-2-3-of-nation-s-electricity"><i>US Bitcoin Miners Use as Much Electricity as Everyone in Utah </i></a> shows that regulators are starting to worry:<br />
<blockquote>
Bitcoin miners in the US are consuming the same amount of electricity as the entire state of Utah, among others, according to a new analysis by the US Energy Information Administration. And that’s considered the low end of the range of use.<br />
<br />
Electricity usage from mining operations represents 0.6% to 2.3% of all the country’s demand in 2023, according to the report released Thursday. It is the first time EIA has shared an estimate. The mining activity has generated mounting concerns from policymakers and electric grid planners about straining the grid during periods of peak demand, energy costs and energy-related carbon dioxide emissions.<br />
<br />
“This estimate of U.S. electricity demand supporting cryptocurrency mining would equal annual demand ranging from more than three million to more than six million homes,” the report said.
</blockquote>
Globally, this increase in demand is part of a bigger picture that is concerning, as Eamon Farhat reports in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-24/cryptocurrency-ai-electricity-demand-seen-doubling-in-three-years"><i>Electricity Demand at Data Centers Seen Doubling in Three Years</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Global electricity demand from data centers, cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence could more than double over the next three years, adding the equivalent of Germany’s entire power needs, the International Energy Agency forecasts in its latest report.<br />
<br />
There are more than 8,000 data centers globally, with about 33% in the US, 16% in Europe and close to 10% in China, with more planned. In Ireland, where data centers are developing rapidly, the IEA expects the sector to consume 32% of the country’s total electricity by 2026 compared to 17% in 2022. Ireland currently has 82 centers; 14 are under construction and 40 more are approved.<br />
<br />
Overall global electricity demand is expected to see a 3.4% increase until 2026, the report found. The increase, however, will be more than covered by renewables, such as wind, solar and hydro, and all-time high nuclear power.
</blockquote>
The first step towards stricter regulation is information collection which, as Kristoffer Tigue reports in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/large-cryptocurrency-miners-in-us-now-have-to-report-energy-use-to-government/"><i>Large cryptocurrency miners in US now have to report energy use to government</i></a> has started:<br />
<blockquote>
The Biden administration is now requiring some cryptocurrency producers to report their energy use following rising concerns that the growing industry could pose a threat to the nation’s electricity grids and exacerbate climate change.<br />
<br />
The Energy Information Administration announced last week that it would start collecting energy use data from more than 130 “identified commercial cryptocurrency miners” operating in the US. The survey, which started this week, aims to get a sense of how the industry’s energy demand is evolving and where in the country cryptocurrency operations are growing fastest.<br />
<br />
“As cryptocurrency mining has increased in the United States, concerns have grown about the energy-intensive nature of the business and its effects on the US electric power industry,” the EIA said in a new report, following the announcement. “Concerns expressed to EIA include strains to the electricity grid during periods of peak demand, the potential for higher electricity prices, as well as effects on energy-related carbon dioxide emissions.”

Bitcoin is not nearly as decentralized as advocates claim. It appears a third of the industry is in Texas and thus subject to both US regulators and concerns about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/25/technology/bitrush-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-china.html">Chinese</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/us/bitcoin-mines-china-united-states.html">ownership</a>.  Turner Wright reports that <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-hash-rate-drops-freezing-texas"><i>Bitcoin hash rate drops by 34% amid freezing temperatures in Texas</i></a>:
<blockquote>
A sudden freeze in Texas may have contributed to a 34% drop in the Bitcoin hash rate, as some miners were forced to curtail operations amid demand on the state’s energy grid.<br />
<br />
Beginning on Jan. 14, temperatures in many parts of Texas dropped below freezing for one of the first times since a massive ice storm in February 2023. According to data from YCharts, the total Bitcoin network hash rate fell from more than 629 exahashes per second (EH/s) on Jan. 11 to roughly 415 EH/s on Jan. 15 — a 34% drop. The analytics site reported the hash rate increased to more than 454 EH/s on Jan. 16 as temperatures in Austin briefly rose above freezing during the day.

It isn't just that Texas has maybe a third of the industry, it is also that the US industry is growing much faster than anywhere else. Figures from Luxor Logistics show that in 2023 the US consumed <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-08/bitcoin-mining-why-ethiopia-is-attracting-chinese-crypto-miners">nearly two-thirds of all new mining rigs</a>. The figures come from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-08/bitcoin-mining-why-ethiopia-is-attracting-chinese-crypto-miners"><i>Chinese Bitcoin Miners Find a New Crypto Haven in Ethiopia</i></a> by David Pan and Fasika Tadesse:<br />
<blockquote>
Ethiopia has emerged as a rare opportunity for all firms that mine the original cryptocurrency, as climate change and power scarcity fuel a backlash against the $16 billion-a-year industry (at Bitcoin’s current price) elsewhere. But it holds special appeal for Chinese companies, which once dominated Bitcoin mining but have struggled to compete with local rivals in Texas, the current hub.<br />
</blockquote>
The haven isn't without its own <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-08/bitcoin-mining-why-ethiopia-is-attracting-chinese-crypto-miners">clouds</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
It is also a risky gamble, for the companies and Ethiopia alike. A succession of developing countries like Kazakhstan and Iran initially embraced Bitcoin mining, only to turn on the sector when its energy use threatened to fuel domestic discontent. China’s reign as the epicenter of Bitcoin mining came to an abrupt end in 2021, when the government banned it. Dozens of companies were forced to leave.<br />
<br />
Ethiopian officials are wary of the controversy that accompanies Bitcoin mining, according to industry executives who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing government relations. Even after new generation capacity came online, almost half the population live without access to electricity, making mining a delicate topic. At the same time, it represents a potentially lucrative source of foreign-exchange earnings.<br />
...<br />
The reliance on abundant power is also a major vulnerability because it can put miners in competition for electricity with factories and households, exposing them to political backlash.<br />
<br />
When Kazakzstan imposed fresh curbs and taxes on miners, “it basically killed the industry,” said Hashlabs co-founder Alen Makhmetov. Two years after the clampdown, his 10-megawatt facility there is still sitting idle.<br />
<br />
And in an era when rising temperatures wreak havoc around the world, Bitcoin mining is increasingly seen as a contributor to global warming that doesn’t serve any productive purpose — even though miners have claimed they’re increasingly tapping clean energy. A study by United Nations University published in October estimated that two-thirds of the electricity used for Bitcoin mining in 2020 and 2021 was generated using fossil fuels.
</blockquote>
Developing countries aren't the only ones where miners face "domestic discontent". <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/03/us/bitcoin-arkansas-noise-pollution.html"><i>Anxiety, Mood Swings and Sleepless Nights: Life Near a Bitcoin Mine</i></a> by Gabriel J.X. Dance reports on an example in Arkansas:<br />
<blockquote>
The Arkansas Data Centers Act, popularly called the Right to Mine law, offers Bitcoin miners legal protections from communities that may not want them operating nearby. Passed just eight days after it was introduced, the law was written in part by the Satoshi Action Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Mississippi whose co-founder worked in the Trump administration rolling back Obama-era climate policies.
</blockquote>
The law <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/03/us/bitcoin-arkansas-noise-pollution.html">ins't popular</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
A furious backlash has some lawmakers considering a statewide ban.
</blockquote>
The Satoshi Action Fund <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/03/us/bitcoin-arkansas-noise-pollution.html">over-reached</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Despite efforts to build bipartisan support, the Satoshi fund has succeeded predominantly in red states. But in Arkansas, where the state legislature is dominated by Republicans, it is conservatives who have led calls to repeal the law, including Senator Bryan King, a poultry farmer whose district includes a property purchased by one of the companies tied to the Chinese government. He said it was not fair that the Bitcoin operators received special protections under the law, which shields them from “<a href="https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Home/FTPDocument?path=%2FACTS%2F2023R%2FPublic%2FACT851.pdf">discriminatory industry specific regulations and taxes</a>,” including noise ordinances and zoning restrictions.
</blockquote>
At least the Ethiopian mines don't emit much CO2, they run on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-08/bitcoin-mining-why-ethiopia-is-attracting-chinese-crypto-miners">hydropower</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The opening of the GERD project increased Ethiopia’s installed generation capacity to 5.3 gigawatt, 92% of which comes from hydropower, a renewable energy source.<br />
<br />
Once GERD is fully completed, Ethiopia’s generation capacity will double, according to Ethiopian Electric Power. It charges Bitcoin miners a fixed rate of 3.14 US cents per kilowatt hour for electricity drawn from substations, Marketing and Business Development Director Hiwot Eshetu said in an interview.<br />
<br />
While that’s similar to the average in Texas, rates in the Lone Star State can swing wildly, Luxor’s Vera said, making profits there less predictable. In Ethiopia, the price will fall once miners connect directly to power plants, according to Hiwot.
</blockquote>
But if the utility can make money selling power to the mines right by the dam they have little incentive to build out the grid than could get the power to the unserved half of the population.<br />
<br />
As regards the longer-term issue of access to state-of-the-art chips, it is important to note that the best mining chips are sold by Bitmain, a Chinese company, but manufactured at TSMC in Taiwan. There are two major risks here. The first is that the US appears determined to prevent China <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/18/tech/us-china-chip-export-curbs-intl-hnk/index.html">importing leading-edge chips</a> and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/02/asml-halts-hi-tech-chip-making-exports-to-china-reportedly-after-us-request">equipment to make them</a>. China remains at least a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/china-close-to-shipping-5nm-chips-despite-western-curbs/">generation and a half</a> behind TSMC and Samsung, and reportedly has poor yields on its leading-edge process. These restrictions could well prevent Chinese mining companies acquiring leading-edge rigs, and might cause TSMC problems in fab-ing Bitmain products.<br />
<br />
Second, there is the looming threat of a Chinese blockade or even invasion of Taiwan. Of course, difficulties for Bitcoin miners are hardly the major impact if these threats are made good. One might think that, even if supplies of new mining chips were cut off, existing rigs would continue working. In the short term they would, but there is a long history of <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/05/generally-accepted-accounting-principles.html">rigs being obsolete</a> after <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.105901">about 18 months</a>. So they aren't designed or operated for longevity.<br />

## How NASA Uses Simple Technology to Track Lunar Missions

date: 2024-02-13, from: NASA breaking news

NASA is using a simple but effective technology called Laser Retroreflective Arrays (LRAs) to determine the locations of lunar landers more accurately. They will be attached to most of the landers from United States companies as part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Service (CLPS) initiative. LRAs are inexpensive, small, and lightweight, allowing future lunar orbiters [&#8230;]

## US Inflation Slows as Price Pressures Ease Gradually

date: 2024-02-13, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Annual inflation in the United States cooled last month yet remained elevated in the latest sign that the pandemic-fueled price surge is gradually and fitfully coming under control. 


Tuesday's report from the Labor Department showed that the consumer price index rose 0.3% from December to January, up from a 0.2% increase the previous month. Compared with a year ago, prices are up 3.1%. 


That is less than the 3.4% figure in December and far below the 9.1% inflation peak in mid-2022. 


The latest reading is well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target at a time when public frustration with inflation has become a pivotal issue in President Joe Biden's bid for re-election. 


Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, so-called core prices climbed 0.4% last month, up from 0.3% in December and 3.9% over the past 12 months. Core inflation is watched especially closely because it typically provides a better read of where inflation is likely headed. The annual figure is the same as it was in December. 


Biden administration officials note that inflation has plummeted since pandemic-related supply disruptions and significant government aid sent it soaring three years ago. And a raft of forward-looking data suggests that inflation will continue to cool. 


Still, even as it nears the Fed's target level, many Americans remain exasperated that average prices are still about 19% higher than they were when Biden took office. 


The mixed data released Tuesday could reinforce the caution of Fed officials, who have said they're pleased with the progress in sharply reducing inflation but want to see further evidence before feeling confident that it's sustainably headed back to their 2% target. Most economists think the central bank will want to wait until May or June to begin cutting its benchmark rate from its 22-year-high of roughly 5.4. 


The Fed raised its key rate 11 times from March 2022 to July of last year in a concerted drive to defeat high inflation. The result has been much higher borrowing rates for businesses and consumers, including for mortgages and auto loans. Rate cuts, whenever they happen, would eventually lead to lower borrowing costs for many categories of loans. 


In the final three months of last year, the economy grew at an unexpectedly rapid 3.3% annual rate. There are signs that growth remains healthy so far in 2024. Businesses engaged in a burst of hiring last month. Surveys of manufacturing companies found that new orders rose in January. And services companies reported an uptick in sales.

This is what I imagine we all yearn for, for someone to really know us before we die. Okay if it can't be other people, at least let it be a machine. Something like preserving a brain. Wouldn't it be great to know that when you're gone, the essential you, even if it doesn't include your consciousness, persists? You could visit a person like you visit a website. This is just evolutionary, and it's obviously going to happen.

Today would be the perfect day to ski at Belleayre or Hunter, if you can get out of NYC where all the snow is falling. I have work to do and was planning on skiing tomorrow, expecting 8 inches of fresh snow. We're not getting much from this storm in the Catskills, NYC is getting the brunt. And any day you can't get here from the city means not many people on the mountain. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

## Pluralistic: Kelly Link's "Book of Love" (13 Feb 2023)

date: 2024-02-13, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links Kelly Link's "Book of Love": A deceptively quirky tale with rusty razors at its core. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading. Kelly Link's "Book of Love" (permalink) Kelly Link is one of science fiction's most important writers, a master of the short story to rank with the likes of Ted Chiang. For a decade, Kelly's friends have traded whispers that she was working on a novel &#8211; a giant novel &#8211; and the rumors were true and the novel is glorious and you will love it: https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/book-of-love-9781804548455/ https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/239722/the-book-of-love-by-kelly-link/ It's called The Book of Love and it's massive &#8211; 650 pages! It is glorious. It is tricky. If you've read Link's short stories (which honestly, you must read), you know her signature move: a bone-dry witty delivery, used to spin tales of deceptive whimsy and quirkiness, disarming you with daffiness while she sets the hook and yanks. That's the unmistakeable, inimitable texture of a Kelly Link story: deft literary brushstrokes, painting a picture so charming and silly that you don't even notice when she cuts you without mercy. Turns out that she can quite handily do this for hundreds of pages, and the effect only gets better when it's given space to unfold. Hard to tell you about this one without spoilers! But I'll tell you this much. It's a story about three teenaged friends who return from death and find themselves in the music room at their high school, face to face with their mild-mannered music teacher, Mr Anabin. Anabin explains what's happened in frustratingly cryptic &#8211; and very emphatic &#8211; terms, but is interrupted when a sinister shape-shifting wolf enters the music room. This is Bogomil, and whenever he speaks, Mr Anabin turns his back &#8211; and vice versa. Anabin and Bogomil appear to be rivals, and Bogomil may or may not have been the keeper of the land of the dead from which the three have escaped. There's also a forth, a tattered shade who's been dead so long they don't remember who they are or anything about themselves. Bogomil would like to take the four back to the deadlands, but Anabin proposes a contest and Bogomil agrees &#8211; but no one explains the contest or its rules (or even its stakes) to the four dead teenagers. That's the wind up. The pitch that follows is flawless, a long and twisting mystery about friendship, love, queerness, rock-and-roll, stardom, parenthood, loyalty, lust and duty. There's a terrifying elder god of Lovecraftian proportions. There are ghosts upon ghosts. There are ancient grudges. There are sudden revelations that come from unexpected angles but are, in retrospect, perfectly set up. More than anything, there are characters. It's impossible not to love Link's characters, despite (because of) their self-destructive choices and their impossible dilemmas. They are so sweet, but they are also by turns mean and spiteful and resentful, like the pinch of salt that transforms a caramel from inedible spun sugar into something that bites even as it delights. These characters, so very likable, are often dead or at death's door, and that peril propels the story like an unstoppable locomotive. From the very start, it's clear that some of them can't survive to the end, and Link is merciless in making you root for all of them, even though this means rooting against them all. This, in turn, creates moments of toe-curling, sublime horror. Link has built a complex machine with more moving parts than anyone has any business being able to keep track of. And yet, each of these parts meshes flawlessly with all the others. The book ends with such triumphant perfection that it lingers long after you put it down. I can't wait to read this one again.

## Everybody Is Mad About Biden’s Offshore Lease Plans

<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> New York City is expecting six inches of snow • Intense flooding has been recorded across Oman • Parts of southeastern Australia are facing the worst bushfires in four years. </em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Oil industry and environmentalists are mad about Biden’s offshore lease plans </h3><p>
<strong></strong>The Biden administration’s decision to dramatically reduce the number of offshore drilling lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico is proving to be unpopular with the oil industry <em>and</em> environmentalists. The plan is to hold just three lease sales between 2025 and 2029, a record low and far below the 47 proposed during the Trump administration. This week both the American Petroleum Institute (the fossil fuel industry’s <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=43be28c71b&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">biggest</a> trade group) and Earthjustice (an environmental group) filed separate lawsuits over the plan “in a sign of the political tightrope policymakers must walk when rulemaking in the U.S. climate and energy sector,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=7564261d7a&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a> the <em>Financial Times.</em> The oil group wants more lease sales, and accused the government of forcing Americans to rely on foreign energy sources; Earthjustice wants fewer lease sales (or none at all) and said the administration was ignoring public health impacts for frontline communities. “The oil and gas industry is already sitting on 9mn acres of undeveloped leases. They certainly are not entitled to more,” said Brettny Hardy, an Earthjustice attorney.

The China All-Solid-State Battery Collaborative Innovation Platform (CASIP) includes six of the top 10 global battery makers, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=ef2872959a&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> Peter Johnson at <em>Electrek</em>, including would-be rivals BYD and CATL. Solid-state batteries are “a kind of holy-grail technology,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=32609529d3&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a> Patrick George at <em>Heatmap</em>. They can cut charging times and increase EV range compared to lithium-ion batteries, so carmakers are eager to bring a solid-state battery to market. But mass production is still very difficult. The Chinese project “pools academia and industry leaders,” Johnson said, and “could revolutionize the EV market.”
</p><h3>3. Study chronicles 30 years of ice melt on Greenland</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Over the last three decades, Greenland has lost about <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d2cc5c3591&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">11,000 square miles</a> of its ice cover due to global warming, according to a new <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=94e3785d06&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> published in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. The researchers, from the University of Leeds, analyzed high resolution satellite images to understand historical melting trends. They found that as the ice disappears, plants are spreading – the amount of land with some vegetation on it more than doubled in three decades. Greenland is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world. The melting ice creates a feedback loop – exposed rock absorbs more heat, therefore raising the temperature of the land. And the permafrost is melting, too, releasing carbon dioxide and methane.

</p><h3>4. China’s emissions could peak sooner than expected</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Experts think China’s greenhouse gas emissions will peak earlier than originally anticipated, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=c778fbbe4f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> The turning point could even come this year. China is the biggest annual greenhouse gas emitter, but it is rapidly scaling up renewable energy. Just last year its solar power capacity increased by 55%, “more than 500 million solar panels and well above the total installed solar capacity of the U.S.,” the <em>Journal</em> report explained. And it installed more wind energy than the rest of the world combined. “An early peak would have a lot of symbolic value and send a signal to the world that we’ve turned a corner,” said Jan Ivar Korsbakken, a senior researcher at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research.
</p><h3>5. Debate rages on over hypothetical Category 6 hurricanes</h3><p>
	Two climate scientists have sparked debate in their field by <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=1e45a87676&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggesting</a> the Saffir-Simpson Wind Scale, which is used to determine a hurricane’s category, is insufficient in describing the risks posed by stronger storms in the age of climate change. The scale currently goes from 1 to 5, but Michael Wehner of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and James Kossin of the First Street Foundation pondered whether a Category 6 was needed. This was more than a week ago, and the debate is still going. The main objection from other climate experts is that adding a new category “increases the chance of people underestimating the risks from storms that are lower than the highest category,” ABC News <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=6bc27c77aa&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a>. After all, the category only focuses on wind speed and doesn’t tell residents much about other deadly hazards like storm surge and rainfall, which account for most storm-related deaths. “It is not evident how having an additional category on the Saffir-Simpson wind scale would improve preparation or decisions,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=c81c7edd18&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> AccuWeather chief meteorologist Jon Porter.
</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p>

## Molly White Reviews Blockchain Book

date: 2024-02-13, updated: 2024-02-12, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Molly White&#8212;of &#8220;<a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/">Web3 is Going Just Great</a>&#8221; fame&#8212;<a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/review-read-write-own-by-chris-dixon/">reviews</a> Chris Dixon&#8217;s blockchain solutions book: <a href="https://readwriteown.com/"><i>Read Write Own</i></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In fact, throughout the entire book, Dixon fails to identify a <em>single</em> blockchain project that has successfully provided a non-speculative service at any kind of scale. The closest he ever comes is when he speaks of how &#8220;for decades, technologists have dreamed of building a grassroots internet access provider&#8221;. He describes one project that &#8220;got further than anyone else&#8221;: Helium. He&#8217;s right, as long as you ignore the fact that Helium was providing LoRaWAN, not Internet, that by the time he was writing his book Helium hotspots had long since passed the phase where they might generate even enough tokens for their operators to merely break even, and that the network was pulling in somewhere around $1,150 in usage fees a month despite the company being valued at $1.2 billion. Oh, and that the company had widely lied to the public about its supposed big-name clients, and that its executives have been accused of hoarding the project&#8217;s token to enrich themselves. But hey, a16z sunk millions into Helium (a fact Dixon never mentions), so might as well try to drum up some new interest!...</p></blockquote>

## Stormy Times Ahead

date: 2024-02-13, from: Dan Rather's Steady

I noticed Donald Trump will spend more time in front of a judge this week than in front of potential voters. It&#8217;s his new normal. Trump&#8217;s schedule looks like a litigious hellscape. And his calendar for the foreseeable future is more of the same. It&#8217;s all so antithetical to my belief about what kind of person should lead our great nation.

<p>I don’t climb, I am not a climber, I don’t have interest in becoming one. I do happen to have a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ivanmoreale/">brother</a> though. And he’s a climber. And if you know anything about climbers is that they’re a bit obsessed with the sport. And as a result of that I’m becoming a climber by proximity. I have absolutely no intention of practicing the sport but I do enjoy watching it as a sport and I also enjoy consuming content related to it. Mainly because climbers climb in gorgeous places and I love nature. Anyway my brother also happens to be a graphic designer and it was only a matter of time before the two things collided. Well, it finally happened: <a href="https://621.design">621.design</a></p>
<figure class="m-o" data-template="with"><div class="m-m"><img class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/on-climbing-and-design/c7954b39fd-1707814510/621.jpg" style="aspect-ratio:1000 / 1333"></div></figure>
<p>The first series of climbing inspired t-shirts are available to be purchased after WAY TOO LONG! I’m already tired of hearing about this project but I’m happy that they’re finally out in the wild. Just to be clear, I am not involved with this. I’m just doing my part and let you know that these exist because who knows, maybe some of you out there are into climbing.</p>
<p>Now, I do have one of those T-shirts sitting on my desk this very moment. It’s the <a href="https://621.design/products/climb">Climb</a>, size L. If you want it, you can sign up to my <a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">One a Month</a> and then send me a message. I’m gonna send it to the first one who claims it and will throw in something else at random in the package. No drugs I promise you. I might add a book in there or maybe a stick from the woods. Still don’t know but there’s going to be something.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="https://621.design">621.design</a>, also on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/621.design/">Instagram </a>. Go tell my brother that these took WAY TOO LONG to come out.</p>

## Meta says risk of account theft after phone number recycling isn't its problem to solve

<p>Not really pleased with how today&rsquo;s scene is going. I feel like I had good ideas for it two weeks ago, but I didn&rsquo;t write it then, because I still hadn&rsquo;t finished the previous scenes 😖 Now I&rsquo;m scrambling a bit – &ldquo;Oh, this bit of dialogue was in it, right?&rdquo; and it just doesn&rsquo;t feel cohesive. In future I need to take notes, no matter how much I think I&rsquo;m &ldquo;just about&rdquo; to reach a scene, anyway.</p>

## Saving all your GitHub Stars to Pinboard

date: 2024-02-13, from: Conor O'Niell's blog, Cross Dominant

Over the past 18 months or so, I&rsquo;ve been replacing various IFTTT and Low-Code functions with my own code running either in GitHub Actions or AWS Lambda. The latest one is a simple function to save all my latest GitHub Stars to Pinboard once an hour.
This way, no matter what IFTTT/Zapier/etc decide to change this month, I don&rsquo;t have to change anything. Some of my Serverless functions have been running for years with no updates required.

## Biden Forms Task Force to Address Mishandling of Classified Documents During Presidential Transitions

date: 2024-02-13, from: VOA News USA

washington — President Joe Biden on Monday launched a task force aimed at addressing the "systemic" problem of mishandling classified information during presidential transitions, days after a Justice Department special counsel’s sharply critical report said he had done just that.


The Presidential Records Transition Task Force will study past transitions to determine best practices for safeguarding classified information from an outgoing administration, the White House said. It will also assess the need for changes to existing policies and procedures to prevent the removal of sensitive information that by law should be kept with the National Archives and Records Administration.


The report from special counsel Robert Hur listed dozens of sensitive documents found at Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware, and at his former Washington office. The papers were marked as classified or later assessed to contain classified information.


The majority of the documents, Hur's report stated, appeared to have been mistakenly removed from government offices, though he also detailed some items that Biden appeared to knowingly retain. He concluded that criminal charges were not warranted in the matter.


“I take responsibility for not having seen exactly what my staff was doing,” Biden said last week after Hur's report was released. He added that “things that appeared in my garage, things that came out of my home, things that were moved were moved not by me but my staff.”


First findings


Biden aides first discovered some of the documents as they cleared out the offices of the Penn-Biden Center in Washington in 2022, and more were discovered during subsequent searches by Biden's lawyers and the FBI.


Biden promptly reported the discoveries to federal authorities, which prompted the special counsel probe. By contrast, former President Donald Trump is accused of resisting efforts to return classified government records that he moved to his Florida residence before leaving office in 2021 and of obstructing the investigation into them in a separate special counsel investigation.




In even the best of circumstances, presidential transitions can be chaotic as records of the outgoing administration are transferred to the National Archives and thousands of political appointees leave their jobs to make way for the incoming administration.


Officials of multiple administrations have said there is a systemic problem with mishandling of classified information by senior government officials, particularly around transitions, magnified by rampant overclassification across the government.


Former Vice President Mike Pence turned over some classified documents discovered at his home last year. And several times a year, former officials from all levels of government discover they possess classified material and turn it over to the authorities.


“Previous presidential transitions, across administrations stretching back decades, have fallen short in ensuring that classified presidential records are properly archived at NARA,” the White House said. “In light of the many instances that have come to light in recent years revealing the extent of this systemic issue, President Biden is taking action to strengthen how administrations safeguard classified documents during presidential transitions and to help address this long-standing problem going forward.”


Hur’s report said many of the documents recovered at the Penn Biden Center in Washington, in parts of Biden’s Delaware home and in his Senate papers at the University of Delaware were retained by “mistake.”


Subjects of documents


Biden could not have been prosecuted as a sitting president, but Hur’s report states that he would not recommend charges against Biden regardless. Investigators did find evidence of willful retention of a subset of records found in Biden’s Wilmington, Delaware, house, including in a garage, office and basement den, but not enough to suggest charges. The files pertain to a troop surge in Afghanistan during the Obama administration that Biden had vigorously opposed. He kept records that documented his position, including a classified letter to Obama during the 2009 Thanksgiving holiday.


Biden also retained his personal notebooks after leaving the vice presidency, some of which investigators found contained classified information, though other officials have kept similar documents as their personal property.


“President Biden takes classified information seriously – he returned the documents that were found, he fully cooperated with the investigation, and it concluded that there was no case," said Ian Sams, a spokesperson for the White House counsel's office. "Now he is taking action to help strengthen future transitions to better prevent classified documents from being accidentally packed up and removed from the government, like we have seen with officials from every administration for decades.”


The task force will be led by Katy Kale, deputy administrator of the General Services Administration, who was assistant to the president for management and administration during the Obama administration, the post that oversees the human resources and document retention functions at the White House.


The panel will include representatives from the White House, General Services Administration, NARA, the National Security Council and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.


The task force is to produce its recommendations ahead of the next presidential transition. It is set to operate independently from the White House Transition Coordinating Council, which is chaired by the White House chief of staff and required by law to be stood up six months before any presidential election.

## Oscar Nominees From Films 'Oppenheimer,' 'Barbie' Gather for Luncheon

date: 2024-02-12, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES  — The casts of "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer" gathered Monday for the annual Academy Award nominees' luncheon along with other Oscar hopefuls coming together for photos, hugs and congratulations. 


The luncheon is a warm, feel-good, egalitarian affair where little-known first-time nominees in categories like best animated short get to rub shoulders and share tables with acting nominees like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. 


Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie, whose snubs for best director and best actress, respectively, for "Barbie" caused a major stir, were both present for the nominations they did get and were all smiles before lunch. 




Gerwig, nominated for adapted screenplay, was surrounded by selfie-seekers as soon as she entered the ballroom. 


Robbie, up for best picture as a "Barbie" producer, beamed nearby as she hugged and chatted with a woman who got one of the best actress spots, Sandra Hüller of "Anatomy of a Fall." 


The centerpiece of the event in Beverly Hills, California, is a class photo of the entire group of nominees. Nearly all of them usually attend, both as part of the Oscars experience and as part of their unspoken campaigns for votes. 


Before the luncheon began, nominees including Cillian Murphy, a favorite for best actor for "Oppenheimer," and Da'Vine Joy Randolph, a favorite for best supporting actress for "The Holdovers," made the rounds of media outlets whose reporters are set up in cabanas around the Beverly Hilton pool. 


Steven Spielberg, nominated for best picture as a producer of "Maestro," chatted with a small group on the patio. 




Less famous nominees packed into the ballroom and posed for group pictures.


They'll later be seated for a vegetarian menu of king oyster mushrooms and wild mushroom risotto.


The event is also a chance for the leadership of the Academy, including President Janet Yang to give speeches and address their prominent members in person.


She used last year's luncheon to address what she called the Academy's "inadequate" response to Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at the previous year's ceremony. 


Yang's remarks this year had a much lighter tone, and dealt with more banal matters, like the timing of the Oscars ceremony.


"In case any of you have been in a nominations haze, we are starting an hour earlier this year," she said.


When she saw surprise around the room she said, "Ooh, some people didn't know! I'm glad I reminded you!"


She drew groans when she added that the Oscars come on the first day of daylight-saving time.

## Biden Campaign Joins TikTok, Despite Security Concerns

date: 2024-02-12, from: VOA News USA

washington — President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign Monday defended its new TikTok account as a vital way to boost its appeal with young voters, even as his administration continued to raise security concerns about whether the popular social media app might be sharing user data with China’s communist government.


The campaign's inaugural post featured the president being quizzed on Sunday's Super Bowl — and included a reference to the latest political conspiracy theory centering on pop superstar Taylor Swift.


“The president’s TikTok debut last night — with more than 5 million views and counting — is proof positive of both our commitment and success in finding new, innovative ways to reach voters in an evolving, fragmented and increasingly personalized media environment,” Biden reelection deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty said in a statement.


At the White House, though, national security communications adviser John Kirby said that “there are still national security concerns about the use of TikTok on government devices, and there’s been no change to our policy not to allow that.”


Kirby referred most questions about TikTok to the Biden campaign and ducked a more general query about whether it was wise to use the app at all. He said the potential security issues "have to do with concerns about the preservation of data and potential misuse of that data and privacy information by foreign actors.”


Both the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, could share user data — such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers — with that country's authoritarian government. Biden in 2022 signed legislation banning the use of TikTok by the federal government’s nearly 4 million employees on devices owned by its agencies, with limited exceptions for law enforcement, national security and security research purposes.


Separately, the secretive and powerful Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has been reviewing the app for years while trying unsuccessfully to force TikTok ownership to divest from its parent company. The White House said Monday the review was continuing.


With 150 million U.S. users, TikTok is best known for quick snippets of viral dance routines. But Senator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, posted on X that Biden’s campaign is “bragging about using a Chinese spy app even though Biden signed a law banning it on all federal devices.”


The Biden campaign said it had been mulling establishing a TikTok account for months and had ultimately done so at the urging of youth activists and organizations, who argued that the app was key to reaching young voters.


The campaign said it was using a separate cellphone to engage on TikTok to isolate the app from other work streams and communications, including emails. The campaign said it was taking additional steps but declined to name them, citing security concerns.


White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said she wasn't in contact with the campaign and had no advance warning that its TikTok account was going live.

## US Defense Secretary to Take Part in Key Ukraine Meeting Despite Hospitalization

date: 2024-02-12, from: VOA News USA

pentagon — Doctors for U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are expressing optimism that he will be able to resume his normal duties Tuesday and then virtually attend a critical meeting on Ukraine the next day despite a second emergency hospitalization following treatment for prostate cancer.


Austin was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Sunday for what the Pentagon described as “an emergent bladder issue.”


On Monday, doctors said he underwent a nonsurgical procedure under general anesthesia and will be closely monitored overnight, even though they expected a “successful recovery.”


"A prolonged hospital stay is not anticipated. We anticipate the secretary will be able to resume his normal duties tomorrow,” they said in a statement late Monday. “His cancer prognosis remains excellent.”


Austin, 70, had been scheduled to fly to Brussels on Tuesday for an in-person meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) and also a meeting of NATO defense ministers. But the Pentagon canceled those plans earlier Monday and announced the meeting on Ukraine would now be done virtually.


The defense secretary “currently intends to participate in the virtual UDCG,” Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder told reporters.


But Ryder added that Austin “will remain flexible depending on his health care status.”


In addition to Austin, Joint Chiefs Chairman General CQ Brown will also take part in the virtual meeting on Ukraine, as will Assistant Secretary of Defense Celeste Wallander.


Wallander will also travel to Brussels to represent the U.S. at the NATO ministerial meeting along with Ambassador Julianne Smith, the U.S. permanent representative to NATO.  


The meetings of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group and NATO defense ministers come at a critical time.


Ukraine has been fending off waves of intensified Russian drone and missile attacks despite running low on critical munitions, while the U.S. has not sent any military aid to Ukraine since late December, when funding ran out.  Efforts since then by U.S. lawmakers to approve additional aid for Kyiv have so far stalled. 




The U.S. defense secretary was diagnosed with prostate cancer late last year and has been criticized for keeping secret his diagnosis, surgery and subsequent hospitalization because of complications from the procedure. 


This time, the Pentagon said Austin’s aides informed the White House even before he left for the hospital. Congress and the Joint Chiefs chairman were also notified of the developments. 


Austin also transferred control of the department to Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks.


Despite the latest hospitalization, the White House on Monday voiced confidence in Austin’s ability to lead the Defense Department.


President Joe Biden is “not at all” concerned about Austin’s hospitalization impacting his leadership, White House national security communications adviser John Kirby told reporters.


When Austin first returned to work at the Pentagon earlier this month, he apologized for keeping his cancer diagnosis a secret.


“The news shook me. ... Frankly, my first instinct was to keep it private,” Austin told reporters.  “I apologize to my teammates and to the American people.”


“We did not handle this right. And I did not handle this right. I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis. I should have also told my team and the American public, and I take full responsibility,” he added.


Upon being diagnosed with prostate cancer earlier in December, he went to a hospital for a surgical procedure on December 22. 


Austin was readmitted January 1 and spent two more weeks in the hospital after experiencing extreme pain and being admitted to the intensive care unit.


Biden and other key leaders weren't informed of Austin’s diagnosis until more than a week after he’d been readmitted to the hospital.


Austin's lack of disclosure prompted changes in federal guidelines and triggered an internal Pentagon review and an inspector general review into his department’s notification procedures. 


VOA Pentagon Correspondent Carla Babb contributed to this report.

## Just give me some truth

<p>I just found myself writing in a <a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C3RBrhlJfgb">tweet on Threads</a> that the news industry has contempt for its readers that AI tools don't have. </p>
<p>Actually the AIs also have a way better attitude about the truth than Wikipedia does (yes I know Wikipedia is a Ouija board, that the very worst people control).</p>
<p>We weren't worried about the rise of fascism and the destruction of our ecology, but we were worried about preserving jobs for supposed truth-tellers who think we deserve garbage and don't disappoint. </p>

## Trump Asks Supreme Court to Delay Election Interference Trial, Claims Immunity

date: 2024-02-12, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — Former President Donald Trump is asking the Supreme Court to extend the delay in his election interference trial, saying he is immune from prosecution on charges he plotted to overturn his 2020 election loss.


His lawyers filed an emergency appeal with the court Monday, just four days after the justices heard Trump's separate appeal to remain on the presidential ballot despite attempts to kick him off because of his efforts following his election loss in 2020.


"Without immunity from criminal prosecution, the Presidency as we know it will cease to exist," Trump's lawyers wrote, repeating arguments that have so far failed in federal courts.


The filing keeps on hold what would be a landmark criminal trial of a former president while the nation's highest court decides what to do. It met a deadline to ask the justices to intervene that the federal appeals court in Washington set when it rejected Trump's immunity claims and ruled the trial could proceed.


The Supreme Court's decision on what to do, and how quickly it acts, could determine whether the Republican presidential primary front-runner stands trial in the case before the November.




There is no timetable for the court to act, but special counsel Jack Smith's team has strongly pushed for the trial to take place this year. Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly sought to delay the case. If Trump were to defeat President Joe Biden, he could potentially try to use his position as head of the executive branch to order a new attorney general to dismiss the federal cases he faces or even seek a pardon for himself.


The Supreme Court's options include rejecting the emergency appeal, which would enable U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to restart the trial proceedings in Washington's federal court. The trial was first scheduled to begin early March. 


The court also could extend the delay while it hears arguments on the immunity issue. In that event, the schedule the justices might set could determine how soon a trial might begin, if indeed they agree with lower court rulings that Trump is not immune from prosecution. 


In December, Smith and his team had urged the justices to take up and decide the immunity issue, even before the appeals court weighed in. "It is of imperative public importance that Respondent's claim of immunity be resolved by this Court and that Respondent's trial proceed as promptly as possible if his claim of immunity is rejected," prosecutors wrote in December. 


Trump's legal team has ascribed partisan motives to the prosecution's push for a prompt trial, writing in December that it "reflects the evident desire to schedule President Trump's potential trial during the summer of 2024 — at the height of the election season."


Now it's up to a court on which three justices, Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, were appointed by Trump when he was president. They have moved the court to the right in major decisions that overturned abortion rights, expanded gun rights and ended affirmative action in college admissions.


But the Supreme Court hasn't been especially friendly to Trump on legal matters directly concerning the former president. The court declined to take up several appeals filed by Trump and his allies related to the 2020 election. It also refused to prevent tax files and other documents from being turned over to congressional committees and prosecutors in New York.


Last week, however, the justices did seem likely to end the efforts to prevent Trump from being on the 2024 ballot. A decision in that case could come any time.


The Supreme Court has previously held that presidents are immune from civil liability for official acts, and Trump's lawyers have for months argued that that protection should be extended to criminal prosecution as well. 


Last week, a unanimous panel of two judges appointed by President Joe Biden and one by a Republican president sharply rejected Trump's novel claim that former presidents enjoy absolute immunity for actions that fall within their official job duties. It was the second time since December that judges have held that Trump can be prosecuted for actions undertaken while in the White House and in the run-up to Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.


The case was argued before Judges Florence Pan and J. Michelle Childs, appointees of Biden, a Democrat, and Karen LeCraft Henderson, who was named to the bench by President George H.W. Bush, a Republican.


The case in Washington is one of four prosecutions Trump faces as he seeks to reclaim the White House. He faces federal charges in Florida that he illegally retained classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate, a case that was also brought by Smith and is set for trial in May.


He's also charged in state court in Georgia with scheming to subvert that state's 2020 election and in New York in connection with hush money payments made to porn actor Stormy Daniels. He has denied any wrongdoing.

## Is Offshore Wind Out of the Woods?

A variety of companies involved in the business, from developers to turbine manufacturers told analysts and investors about how bad it was when it came time to report their full-year earnings. Orsted,<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/orsted-earnings-bad-us-2023" target="_self"> the Danish energy company</a>, told investors last week that it would have been $2 billion in the black if it were not for its U.S. business; instead it was $3 billion in the red.<strong> </strong>The head of General Electric’s renewables business, meanwhile, told analysts that offshore wind was “challenging” in 2023 and reported a $1.1 billion loss. And BP, after one executive called the offshore wind market “fundamentally broken” <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bp+fundamentally+broken&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS940US940&oq=bp+fundamentally+broken&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyCQgAEEUYORigATIGCAEQRRg80gEIMzY5OGowajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#:~:text=U.S.%20offshore,bp%2Dlow%2Dca..." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">last fall</a>, said this month that it had written down its offshore wind investments by <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/bp-backs-away-from-us-offshore-wind/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$1.1 billion</a> and was also getting out of a joint venture with Norwegian wind energy giant Equinor.<br/><br/>But that could very well be the worst of it. “We are bullish [on] Offshore Wind value creation given most 2023 issues were related to new US market and cyclical pressures rather than structural challenges,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a report earlier this month. Or to put it another way, 2023 was a weird  — and very expensive — year.</p><p>The contracts that fell through in the past year, the analysts said, “relate to a specific vintage of projects, which secured revenues in a lower cost environment in 2018-2021” — that is, they were written for a world without the huge run up in costs due to Covid-era inflation and supply chain issues. “Looking ahead, we believe most of these issues have been addressed,” the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.<del></del></p><p>For another thing, offshore wind still plays a key role in several states’ climate policies, particularly in the Northeast. Whatever issues around costs and contracting might still exist, state governments have incentives to work around them. Now, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/new-york-lures-back-offshore-wind-builders-burnt-by-cost-hikes-2024-02-01/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analysts and advocates predict</a>, contracts will be written with today’s cost environment in mind, making it easier to share costs to connect projects to the grid. “A number of states like New York have now adopted mechanisms that help de-risk projects,” Fred Zalcman, director of the New York Offshore Wind Alliance, told me.</p><p>If all goes well, New York and other states’ decision not to go forward on some contracts due to cost disagreements with developers will only delay the projects — it was the contracts that were the problem, not the projects themselves. Those same developers can rebid for a new, more comfortable deal.</p><p>Later this month, New York is expected to award new contracts as part of a new program to fast track procurement following regulators’ refusal to adjust existing contracts for higher costs; both Orsted and Equinor submitted <a href="https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/All-Programs/Offshore-Wind/Focus-Areas/Offshore-Wind-Solicitations/2023-Solicitation" target="_blank">new bids</a> for their Sunrise and Empire Wind projects. Earlier this year, New Jersey, where Orsted had previously cancelled two projects, <a href="https://www.nj.gov/bpu/newsroom/2023/approved/20240124.html" target="_blank">awarded contracts</a> for more than 3 gigawatts of new capacity , and Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island — all three of which have had offshore wind deals fall through or not go forward because of high costs — decided to <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/new-england-state-agreement-offshore-wind-procurement/695603/" target="_blank">coordinate to bid</a> on future offshore wind projects.<br/></p><p>Even after the industry’s <em>annus horribilis</em>, utility-scale projects off the coast of New York and Massachusetts are now producing power, expanding the industry past its small-scale existence off Rhode Island and Virginia. 2024 “will be a period for the industry to basically reboot,” Zalcman told me. “We have a number of procurements in process and planned that should hopefully more than compensate for the attrition in the pipeline.”</p><p>It is, unfortunately, worth mentioning that even if these projects continue to move forward, neither <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/07/new-york-energy-climate-goals-00139979the" target="_blank">ambitious states like New York</a> nor the Biden administration — whose 30 GW by 2030 goal analysts have, for months, thought was essentially unattainable — are likely to meet their development timelines. <strong><em></em></strong></p><p>If 2023 was the year of failure for offshore wind, 2024 might at least be the year of failing better.<br/></p>

## Is Nuclear Energy Having a Renaissance?

date: 2024-02-12, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTQzNTQ0My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcwODc2NjY2Mn0.4uJBV1WCIqO5JLhXxHse1tc5kHVkL_SiafkCmG0DwDs/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	For a while there, nuclear energy looked like it was on its way out. After taking off post-World War II, it lost momentum toward the dawn of the 21st century, when sagging public support and mounting costs led to 
	<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40720249" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dozens of cancellations</a> in the U.S. and drove the rate of new proposals off a cliff. <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=57280" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Only a few</a> reactors have been built in the U.S. this century; the most recent, Georgia Power’s Plant Vogtle units 3 and 4, were years behind schedule and billions of dollars <a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-power-nuclear-reactor-vogtle-9555e3f9169f2d58161056feaa81a425" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">over budget</a>. Vogtle-3 came online last summer, with Vogtle-4 — which was delayed even further by an <a href="https://www.augustachronicle.com/story/news/environment/2023/10/06/startup-of-unit-4-nuclear-reactor-at-plant-vogtle-delayed-to-2024/71088605007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">equipment malfunction</a> — expected to follow early this year.
</p><p>
	It’s funny how time works, though. With 
	<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/biden-offer-1-5-billion-222449405.html" target="_blank">demand for reliable zero-carbon energy</a> rising, a new wave of nuclear developers is trying to recapture some of the industry’s long-lost momentum. They’re entering the race to net-zero with big ambitions — and much smaller reactor designs. Whether you’re wondering about the <a href="#how-did-us-nuclear-energy-become-what-it-is-today">state of the U.S. nuclear power sector,</a> <a href="#what-are-advanced-nuclear-reactors">what’s new</a> about <a href="#what-role-will-nuclear-power-play-in-the-future">new nuclear</a>, where the <a href="#what-about-nuclear-waste">nuclear waste is going</a>, and of course, <a href="#is-nuclear-power-safe">whether it’s safe</a>, read on.
</p><p>
	Let’s 
	<a href="#how-do-nuclear-plants-work">start with the basics</a>.
</p><h2 class="rm-anchors" id="how-do-nuclear-plants-work">How do nuclear plants work?</h2><p>
	Nuclear reactors generate electricity using a process called 
	<a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fission</a>. Inside the reactor’s core, a controlled chain reaction splits unstable <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/materials/fuel-cycle-fac/ur-enrichment.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">uranium</a>-235 into smaller elements; that process releases heat — <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/nuclear-101-how-does-nuclear-reactor-work" target="_blank">a lot of heat</a>.
</p><p>
	The reactors in today’s U.S. nuclear fleet fall into two categories: boiling water reactors and pressurized water reactors. Each 
	<a href="https://www.world-nuclear.org/uploadedFiles/org/WNA/Publications/Nuclear_Information/Pocket%20Guide%20Reactors.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">circulates water</a> through the reactor core to manage the temperature and prevent meltdowns, and both use the heat produced by fission to create steam that powers turbines and thereby generates electricity. The main difference is in the details: Boiling water reactors use their coolant water to produce electricity directly, by capturing the steam, whereas pressurized water reactors keep their coolant water in a separate system that’s under enough pressure to prevent the water from turning to steam.
</p><p>
	Some experimental reactors and newer commercial designs use different cooling systems, but we’ll get into those later. Lastly, while nuclear energy is not considered renewable, in the sense that it relies on a finite resource (enriched uranium) for fuel, it 
	<em>is</em> a zero-emission energy source.
</p><h2 class="rm-anchors" id="how-did-us-nuclear-energy-become-what-it-is-today">How did U.S. nuclear energy become what it is today?</h2><p>
	The sector emerged in the late 1950s and expanded rapidly over the next several decades. At its peak, the country’s nuclear fleet included 
	<a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/us-nuclear-industry.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">112 reactors</a> — a number that has declined to about 90 today. Most of the surviving plants were <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=30972" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">built between</a> 1970 and 1990.
</p><p>
	The shrinkage has partly to do with the nuclear disarmament movement, which arose during the Cold War and grew to encompass nuclear power development, as well. (As it happens, much of the present day environmental movement has its roots in anti-nuclear activism.) Then there was the partial nuclear meltdown at Three Mile Island in 1979, which intensified existing public opposition to nuclear energy projects. That growing pushback, combined with reduced growth in electricity demand and the significant up-front investments nuclear plants required, caused some projects to be scrapped and fewer to be proposed. The Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 seemed to confirm everyone’s worst fears.
</p><p>
	Interest began to reemerge in the U.S. in the early 2000s as the budding public awareness of climate change cast doubt on the future viability of fossil fuels, but the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident quashed 
	<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nuclear-power-looks-to-regain-its-footing-10-years-after-fukushima/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">many of those plans</a>. The last U.S. nuclear plant to start up before Vogtle-3 entered construction in 1973 but was suspended for <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=57280" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two decades</a> before its completion in 2016.
</p><h2 class="rm-anchors" id="what-is-nuclears-role-in-the-current-energy-system">What’s nuclear power’s role in the current energy system?</h2><p>
	As of 2022, 18.2% of U.S. electricity came from the country’s remaining nuclear reactors, according to 
	<a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">federal data</a>. That’s less than we’ve seen in decades.
</p><p>
	The share of nuclear power on the grid has been slowly dwindling as aging reactors are shut down and other resources — mainly natural gas and renewables — have taken on a greater proportion of the country’s electricity-generating burden. The share of electricity from renewables 
	<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=55960" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">surpassed energy from nuclear</a> for the first time in 2021; in 2022, renewables contributed 21.3% of U.S. electricity.
</p><p>
	Like coal and gas plants (and renewables when paired with sufficient storage), nuclear provides 
	<a href="https://www.epa.gov/power-sector/electric-power-sector-basics" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">baseload power</a> — meaning it sends electricity onto the grid at a consistent, predictable rate — as opposed to sources like wind and solar on their own, which provide intermittent supply. Electric utilities depend heavily on nuclear plants and other baseload resources to match supply with continuously fluctuating demand, accommodating the variability of wind and solar without sending too much or too little power onto the grid, which would cause power surges or blackouts.
</p><h2 class="rm-anchors" id="is-nuclear-power-safe">Is nuclear power safe?</h2><p>
	Generating electricity using nuclear fission remains a divisive issue that cuts across partisan lines. In the inaugural Heatmap Climate Poll, nuclear came in a 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/americans-love-solar-and-want-it-on-their-roofs" target="_blank">distant last</a> among clean energy sources people feel comfortable having in their communities.
</p><center><iframe aria-label="Grouped Columns" data-external="1" frameborder="0" height="560" id="datawrapper-chart-PoDmf" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/PoDmf/2/" style="border: none;" title="I would welcome into my community ..." width="680">
</iframe></center><p>
	Some major environmental groups like the 
	<a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/nuclear-free" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sierra Club</a> and <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/tag/nuclear/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Greenpeace</a> maintain that the risk of serious disasters at nuclear power plants poses an unacceptable risk to communities and ecosystems. Others, including the <a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/who-we-are/how-we-work/policy/clean-energy-climate-policy-economic-benefits/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nature Conservancy</a>, view it as a reliable low-carbon energy resource that’s — crucially — available to us today, while promising but immature options such as long-duration energy storage are still catching up.
</p><p>
	Historically, nuclear has caused 
	<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/which-power-sources-are-most-deadly-hint-not-solar-and-wind" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">far fewer fatalities</a> than fossil fuels, which generate all kinds of toxic, potentially deadly pollution — and that’s without factoring in their contribution to climate change and its associated disasters.
</p><p>
	The companies now hoping to pioneer a new generation of nuclear reactors in the U.S. say their designs incorporate the 
	<a href="https://www.iaea.org/bulletin/ensuring-the-safety-of-nuclear-installations-lessons-learned-from-the-fukushima-daiichi-accident" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lessons learned</a> from the accidents in Chernobyl and Fukushima, putting even more safeguards in place than the fleet of reactors operating across the country today. (There’s still a <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/advanced-isnt-always-better" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">debate</a> over whether the proposed reactors will actually be safer, though.)
</p><h2 class="rm-anchors" id="what-about-nuclear-waste">What about nuclear waste?</h2><p>
	Spent uranium fuel is radioactive, and will remain radioactive for a very long time. As a result, there’s still a lot of disagreement about where that waste should go.
</p><p>
	The federal government tried in the early 2000s to create a national repository in Nevada’s Yucca Mountain, but the project was stopped by intense local and regional opposition. The Western Shoshone, a tribe whose members have long 
	<a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/nuclear-frontline-communities" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">faced exposure</a> to radioactive fallout from nearby nuclear tests, <a href="https://guides.library.unr.edu/yuccamountain/timeline2000-2016" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sued</a> the federal government in 2005. Harry Reid, a former U.S. Senator from Nevada who served as Majority Leader from 2007 to 2015, also <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/237845-reids-exit-removes-obstacle-to-yucca-nuclear-waste-site/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fought against</a> the repository.
</p><p>
	In the absence of a central repository, the waste produced by nuclear plants is usually stored in deep 
	<a href="https://www.nrc.gov/waste/spent-fuel-storage/pools.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">water pools</a>, which keep the spent fuel cool, or in steel casks onsite to keep the radiation from escaping into the surrounding environment.
</p><p>
	If a repository eventually opens, some existing waste will likely be moved out of 
	<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nuclear-waste-is-piling-up-does-the-u-s-have-a-plan/#:~:text=Without%20a%20geologic%20repository%2C%20there,radioactive%20material%20from%20the%20environment." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">temporary storage</a> and relocated there.
</p><h2 class="rm-anchors" id="why-arent-more-nuclear-plants-being-built">Why aren’t more traditional nuclear plants being built nowadays?</h2><p>
	In short, the concrete behemoths that have long been the norm in the U.S. are really, really expensive to build. They also — like the two new 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/where-nuclear-reactors-built-small-cost" target="_blank">Vogtle reactors</a> — have a tendency to go way over their deadlines and budgets. That makes the electricity nuclear plants generate <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/html/epa_08_04.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">particularly expensive</a>.
</p><p>
	The vast majority of U.S. coal plants were built during the 
	<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=30812" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">same few decades</a> as most of the country’s nuclear reactors. But when utilities started to face more pressure to reduce their carbon emissions, toppling coal’s reign over the power sector, utilities wound up <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/business/energy-environment/renewable-energy-natural-gas.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">preferring to build</a> cheaper — and, at least at the time, less controversial — natural gas power plants over nuclear power plants.
</p><p>
	But public opinion is beginning to shift. About 57% of American adults favor building new nuclear power, a 
	<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/18/growing-share-of-americans-favor-more-nuclear-power/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pew Research Center survey</a> found last year, compared with 43% in 2016. Though support is higher among Republicans than Democrats, it’s on the rise within both parties.
</p><h2 class="rm-anchors" id="what-are-advanced-nuclear-reactors">What are advanced nuclear reactors, and how are they different?</h2><p>
	Today’s electric grid is a far cry from the 20th-century grid that traditional nuclear reactors were built for, and the new reactor models that are making the most headway 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/where-nuclear-reactors-built-small-cost" target="_self">reflect those changes</a>. In general, these designs are smaller, cheaper (at least on paper), and more flexible than those already in operation.
</p><p>
	Unlike traditional reactors, which generally require a lot of custom fabrication to be completed at the project site, small modular reactors — such as the ones being developed by NuScale Power — have components that are meant to be made in a factory, assembled quickly wherever they’ll operate, and combined with other modules as needed to increase power output. Fast reactors (so-named for their highly energized neutrons), like Bill-Gates-fronted TerraPower’s Natrium design, circulate coolants other than water through the core. (Natrium uses liquid sodium.)
</p><p>
	Advocates of next-generation nuclear power are optimistic that the first such reactors will come online before the end of the decade. Several of the leading proposals have run into financial and logistical troubles over the last couple of years, however. In November, NuScale 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/nuscale-small-modular-reactor-nuclear-costs-inflation" target="_self">canceled its flagship project</a> at the Idaho National Laboratory. It had been on track to be the first commercial small modular reactor built in the U.S. but was thwarted by rising costs, which caused too many expected buyers of its electricity to pull their support.
</p><h2 class="rm-anchors" id="nuclear-power-outside-the-us">What’s going on with nuclear power outside the U.S.?</h2><p>
	Nuclear’s image is recovering globally, too. Some of the companies working on demonstration reactors in the U.S. have been outspoken about wanting to see their designs supplant fossil fuels and provide abundant energy all over the world. Meanwhile, many countries are devoting plenty of their own resources to nuclear power.
</p><p>
	Japan, which shuttered its sizable nuclear fleet in the aftermath of the Fukushima accident, is slowly bringing some of its nuclear capacity back online. In December, Japanese regulators 
	<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/worlds-biggest-nuclear-plant-japan-resume-path-towards-restart-2023-12-27/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lifted an operational ban</a> on the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant, the largest nuclear plant in the world.
</p><p>
	Nuclear power is also enjoying renewed popularity in parts of Europe, including France and the U.K. In France, where the long-dominant technology has faltered in recent years, a 
	<a href="https://www.power-technology.com/news/france-has-laid-out-ambitious-nuclear-plans-but-challenges-remain/?cf-view" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">half-dozen</a> new nuclear power plants are in the works, and even more small modular reactors could follow. The U.K. is also planning a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/11/uk-government-sets-out-plans-for-biggest-nuclear-power-expansion-in-70-years" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new wave</a> of nuclear development.
</p><p>
	Elsewhere, including in Germany, nuclear hasn’t found the same traction. After delaying the closure of its 
	<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/nuclear-reactors-germany-invest-gas-power-plants-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">last three</a> nuclear reactors amid natural gas shortages caused by the war in Ukraine, Germany closed the reactors last spring, eliciting a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/15/europe/germany-nuclear-phase-out-climate-intl/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mixed reaction</a> from environmental groups.
</p><p>
	Meanwhile, China has close to 23 gigawatts of nuclear capacity under construction — the “<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/chinas-wildly-complex-energy-transition-explained-in-8-charts" target="_blank">largest nuclear expansion in history</a>,” Jacopo Buongiorno, a professor of nuclear science and engineering at MIT, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/30/how-china-became-king-of-new-nuclear-power-how-us-could-catch-up.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>CNBC</em></a> last year.
</p><h2 class="rm-anchors" id="what-role-will-nuclear-power-play-in-the-future">What role will nuclear play in the energy mix of the future?</h2><p>
	It’s still early days for most of the world’s next-generation nuclear reactors. With even the most promising designs largely unproven, there’s plenty of uncertainty about where today’s projects will ultimately lead. That makes it tricky to predict what role nuclear power will play in the energy transition over the coming decades.
</p><p>
	There’s plenty of interest in building more capacity, however. In December, at COP28, the U.S. and 24 other countries — including Japan, Korea, France and the UK — 
	<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/cop28-countries-launch-declaration-triple-nuclear-energy-capacity-2050-recognizing-key" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">signed on to a goal</a> of tripling global nuclear energy capacity by 2050 in order to stay on track to reach net-zero emissions by then. Nuclear plants could also be an important source of carbon-free energy for <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/the-nuclear-hydrogen-conundrum" target="_blank">producing green hydrogen</a>, a nascent industry that got a major boost from <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_blank">tax credits</a> under the Inflation Reduction Act.
</p><p>
	But the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s most recent capacity forecast projects that the total amount of electricity from the country’s nuclear plants 
	<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=56160" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">will decline</a> in the coming decades — representing just 13% of net <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/us-nuclear-industry.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">power generation</a> by 2050.

## NASA Solar Sail Technology Passes Crucial Deployment Test

date: 2024-02-12, from: NASA breaking news

By Wayne Smith In his youth, NASA technologist Les Johnson was riveted by the 1974 novel “The Mote in God’s Eye,” by Jerry Pournelle and Larry Niven, in which an alien spacecraft propelled by solar sails visits humanity. Today, Johnson and a NASA team are preparing to test a similar technology. NASA continues to unfurl [&#8230;]

## US Seizes Boeing 747 Iran Illegally Sold to Venezuelan Firm

date: 2024-02-12, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — The U.S. government has seized a Boeing 747 cargo plane that officials say was previously sold by a sanctioned Iranian airline to a state-owned Venezuelan firm in violation of American export control laws.


The Justice Department said Monday that the American-built plane had arrived in Florida and would be disposed of.


The plane had earlier been transferred from Iranian airline Mahan Air — which officials have alleged provides support for Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force — to Emtrasur, a Venezuelan cargo airline and subsidiary of a state-owned firm that had previously been sanctioned by the United States. Officials said the sale, done without U.S. government authorization, violated export control laws and improperly benefited Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.


Mahan Air has for years been subject to U.S. government restrictions on its business.


"The Justice Department is committed to ensuring that the full force of U.S. laws deny hostile state actors the means to engage in malign activities that threaten our national security," Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen, the head of the department's national security division, said in a statement.


The plane was detained in June 2022 by Argentine law enforcement, and U.S. officials moved several weeks later to take possession of it. Argentina officially transferred custody of the plane to the U.S. on Sunday, officials said.


The Justice Department said the plane would now be "prepared for disposition," though it did not elaborate.


The Justice Department has identified the registered captain of the plane as an ex-commander for the Revolutionary Guard. Officials also cited a flight log they say was recovered that shows additional flights after the transfer to Emtrasur to locations including Moscow, Caracas and Tehran — all without U.S. government approval.


Mahan Air has denied any ties to the aircraft, and Venezuela has demanded that Argentine authorities release the plane.


On Sunday, members of a Venezuelan-led, left-leaning alliance condemned Argentina for its role in the plane being seized by the U.S., characterizing the actions as "theft." The Bolivarian Alliance of the Peoples of Our America — Peoples' Trade Treaty argued that the actions violate international law.


"This aggression is another consequence of the unilateral coercive measures imposed by the government of the United States that threaten the sovereignty of Venezuela and violate the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter and International Law," the group, commonly known as the Alba Alliance, said in a statement.


The alliance was created in 2004 by Venezuela and Cuba in a bid to counter U.S. influence in the region. Nicaragua, Bolivia and some Caribbean nations are among its current members.

## Defense Secretary Cancels Travel Plans After Hospitalization

date: 2024-02-12, from: VOA News USA

washington  — The Pentagon has canceled plans for U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to travel to Brussels for key meetings on Ukraine and for talks with NATO allies, just a day after he was hospitalized again for complications after prostate cancer surgery.


A U.S. defense official tells VOA that the meetings on Ukraine through the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, set for Wednesday, will now be held virtually.


There is no word yet on whether Austin will participate in that meeting, or on how the Defense Department will handle a NATO defense ministers meeting scheduled for Thursday.


Monday’s decision to cancel the trip comes less than 24 hours after defense officials announced Austin was back in the hospital with what the Pentagon described as “an emergent bladder issue.”


Officials at Walter Reed Military Medical Center said Sunday that Austin was admitted to the hospital’s critical care unit “for supportive care and close monitoring” after undergoing tests. 


“At this time, it is not clear how long Secretary Austin will remain hospitalized,” the officials said in a statement. “The current bladder issue is not expected to change his anticipated full recovery. His cancer prognosis remains excellent.” 


Due to the most recent hospitalization, Austin transferred control of the department to Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks.  


Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder said the White House, Congress and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had been notified of the developments.  


Austin was diagnosed with prostate cancer late last year and has been criticized for keeping secret his diagnosis, surgery and subsequent hospitalization due to complications from the procedure.  


Following his return to the Pentagon, the 70-year-old Austin apologized for his handling of the situation.


“The news shook me. ... Frankly, my first instinct was to keep it private,” he told reporters.  “I apologize to my teammates and to the American people.”  


“We did not handle this right. And I did not handle this right. I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis. I should have also told my team and the American public, and I take full responsibility,” he added.


Upon being diagnosed with prostate cancer earlier in December, he went to a hospital for a surgical procedure on December 22. 


Austin was readmitted January 1, and spent two more weeks in the hospital after experiencing extreme pain and being admitted to the intensive care unit. 


President Joe Biden and other key leaders were only informed of Austin’s diagnosis more than a week after he’d been readmitted to the hospital.  


Austin's lack of disclosure prompted changes in federal guidelines and triggered an internal Pentagon review and an inspector general review into his department’s notification procedures.   


Pentagon correspondent Carla Babb contributed to this report.

## Dealing with North Korean Threats of War

date: 2024-02-12, updated: 2024-02-12, from: RAND blog

On January 10, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un abandoned decades of seeking peaceful Korean unification. He seems likely to escalate because of serious internal problems and because his Cold War approach of provocations has failed to achieve his external objectives. Has Kim really decided to go to war?

## Consumers Have Fewer Choices as Brands Prune Their Offerings

date: 2024-02-12, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — How much choice is too much?


Apparently for Coca-Cola, it's about 400 different types of drinks.


That's why the beverage company recently decided to discontinue half of them, shedding brands like Tab, Zico coconut water, Diet Coke Fiesty Cherry and Odwalla juices but still leaving about 200 others to choose from.


It's a move that other businesses are making as well, reducing the variety of offerings from mayonnaise to cereals to cars and instead focusing on what they think will sell best.


Stew Leonard’s, a supermarket chain that operates stores in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey, now has 24 cereal flavors or types, down from 49 in 2019. Edgewell Personal Care Co., the maker of Schick razors and Banana Boat suntan lotion, has trimmed certain varieties of its anti-bacteria wipes Wet Ones, among others. And Dollar General, based in Goodlettsville, Tennessee, used to stock six different kinds of mayonnaise on its shelves and is now looking to drop a couple of them.


“The consumer is not going to know the difference,” Todd J. Vasos, CEO of Dollar General, told analysts in December. “Actually, it’s going to make her life a little simpler when she goes to the shelf.”


Just a year ago, Kohl's store in Clifton, New Jersey had tables stacked high with sweaters and shirts in a rainbow of colors as well as dress racks crammed with a wide assortment of styles. Now, it boasts a more edited approach — tables have slim piles of knit shirts that focus on fewer colors, and many dress racks have been reduced to just three or four styles.


Under its new CEO Tom Kingsbury, Kohl's has been cutting back on the colors and variations of sweaters, jeans and other items, while sending their buyers into the New York market more frequently to bring in fresh trendy merchandise.


“We would go out, and we would buy a lot of goods and it would come in 12, 14 months later, and it didn’t perform very well,” Kingsbury told analysts in a call in November. “We're going to be using the marketplace, so that we can react to the business quickly, getting into trends.”


Some customers like the changes so far.


“It’s pretty organized,” said Kimberly Ribeiro, 30, who was at the Kohl's store on a recent Friday. “If it’s not so cluttered, then you don’t get overwhelmed.”


Even in the auto world, shoppers are finding fewer choices. Both General Motors and Ford have been touting how they are limiting the number of option combinations customers can get on their vehicles to reduce manufacturing and purchasing complexity.




That's a reversal from a few years ago when there was an explosion of choices, encouraged in part by online shopping that paid no mind to space constraints. But that didn't always lead to sales, so companies started pruning selections a year or two before the pandemic.


During the pandemic, the pruning only accelerated, with companies focusing on necessities as they wrestled with supply chain clogs. But even after the pandemic, when goods began moving freely again, many businesses decided less was better and justified the limited selection by asserting shoppers don't want so much choice. It's also more profitable for companies because they're not carrying over as many leftovers that need to be discounted.


Overall, new items accounted for about 2% of products in stores in 2023 across categories such as beauty, footwear, technology and toys, down from 5% of items in 2019, says market-research firm Circana.


Eric O’Toole, president of Edgewell’s North America division, noted the pandemic presented “a really valuable stimulus” for reassessing assortment.


“We avoid jumping on fads, as the supply chain and retailer costs required to support  


getting to shelf typically don’t generate a return in the end," O'Toole said. "A tighter,  


more curated portfolio supports healthy profit management.”


Many think they're doing shoppers a favor, with studies showing that fewer choices, not lots of variety, encourage shoppers to buy more.


In 2000, psychologists Sheena Lyengar and Mark Lepper published a study that showed limited selection is better for the shopper. In their experiment, Lyengar and Lepper found consumers were 10 times more likely to purchase jam on display when the number of jams available was cut down from 24 to 6 even though they were more likely to stop at the display offering more selection. Subsequent studies have confirmed this phenomenon. 


“Retailers are recognizing that they have to be respectful of shoppers' time,” said Paco Underhill whose company, Envirosell, studies consumer behavior.


Still, retailers can't just slash products willy-nilly, said David Berliner, who leads the business restructuring and turnaround practice at BDO.


“You want to make these cuts so they’re not even aware of it, and you want the store to still look full," Berliner said. “If you do it too much, you might scare some away."

## Yellen to Visit Pittsburgh, Detroit to Tout Biden's Economic Wins

date: 2024-02-12, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will travel to the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Michigan this week as part of an election-year push aimed at showcasing what she calls "the strongest economic comeback of our lifetimes."


Yellen will visit Pittsburgh on Feb. 13 and Detroit on Feb. 14 for events with elected officials and community leaders focused on the Biden administration's efforts to lower health care costs, support small businesses and boost economic opportunity, the Treasury said.


The trips build on Yellen's visits to Illinois and Wisconsin in January and other states such as Nevada and North Carolina last year. But the administration's marketing efforts have failed to convince the American public, according to recent polls.


A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showed President Joe Biden is running six percentage points behind Republican front-runner former President Donald Trump, with voters focused on immigration challenges, Biden's age and are still unhappy about the economy despite big improvements since he took office in 2021.


Yellen has counseled patience in the past, arguing that the shock caused by the COVID pandemic left lingering concerns, while expressing confidence about improving consumer sentiment.


"Over the past three years, the Biden administration has driven the strongest economic comeback of our lifetimes," Yellen said in a speech to be given at the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday. She will also meet with Democratic Senator Bob Casey, a strong supporter of Biden.


She will hail strong economic growth in the U.S., a quicker and more rapid cooling of inflation than in other advanced economies, and the continued strength of the labor market.


With unemployment below 4% and household median wealth up 37% between 2019 and 2022 — the largest three-year increase on record — Americans now had more purchasing power, she said.


In Detroit, whose economic recovery has lagged behind other cities somewhat, Yellen will speak at a joint event with Governor Gretchen Whitmer, meet with Senator Debbie Stabenow and local business leaders, and give a speech focused on small businesses.


Detroit has seen economic advances, but other Midwestern counterparts have higher numbers of workers earning a living wage, according to University of Michigan economists.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-02-12, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

The SuperBowl last night was an excellent sports game. I didn't like all the bullshit, but it was good sport. However it's all about gambling. I bet it's ruining a lot of lives. A way of sucking the last pennies from people who are already struggling. And it's so easy, just get an app for your phone, add your credit card, and give them all your money.

## Trump Appears at Federal Court in Florida for Closed Hearing in His Classified Documents Case

date: 2024-02-12, from: VOA News USA

Fort Pierce, Florida — Seeking to turn legal problems into political gain, former President Donald Trump arrived Monday to a crowd of supporters at a federal courthouse in Florida for a closed hearing in the criminal case charging him with mishandling classified documents.


In the latest mixing of court appearances into Trump's election-season calendar, supporters with signs and flags assembled outside a courthouse barricade as a Trump campaign message to allies with the subject line of “I'm in court. Again!” warned that unspecified opponents “want me arrested” and “erased from the ballot.”


The message underscored anew his team's strategy of politicizing his four criminal prosecutions, including in the battleground state of Florida, where he faces dozens of felony counts accusing him of hoarding highly classified records at his Mar-a-Lago estate and obstructing FBI efforts to get them back.


Monday’s court date was scheduled as a procedural hearing, closed to the public, to discuss the procedures for handling classified evidence in the trial currently set for May 20. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon set arguments in the morning from defense lawyers and in the afternoon from prosecutors, each outside of the other's presence.


“Defense counsel shall be prepared to discuss their defense theories of the case, in detail, and how any classified information might be relevant or helpful to the defense,” Cannon wrote in scheduling the hearing.


The closed hearing comes as prosecutors have also revealed that a prospective government witness has received threats over social media that are now the subject of federal investigation.


Trump's motorcade arrived at the courthouse in Fort Pierce shortly after 9 a.m. Supporters outside held signs with messages including “Trump 2024” and “Florida is Trump Country.”


The hearing is one of several voluntary court dates that Trump has attended in recent weeks — he was present, for instance, at appeals court arguments last month in Washington — as he looks to demonstrate to supporters that he intends to fight the criminal prosecutions he faces while also seeking to reclaim the White House this November.


Trump faces charges in Atlanta and Washington related to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. He's also charged in state court in New York in connection with hush money payments made to porn actor Stormy Daniels. He has denied any wrongdoing.

## Humans Are Pushing Migratory Species to Extinction

date: 2024-02-12, from: Heatmap News

<em><strong>Current conditions: </strong>A freak hail storm hit Abu Dhabi • Beaches in Trinidad and Tobago are black after a massive oil spill • It will be another wet week in California.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>
1. Study: Many migratory species face extinction
</h3><p>
<strong></strong>One in five migratory species are at risk of extinction, and humans are mostly to blame, according to a grim <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d708e2ee08&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new United Nations report</a>. The State of the World’s MIgratory Species report from the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (CMS) is the first to study the many creatures – from elephants to butterflies to birds – that travel thousands of miles every year to breed, eat, or find new climates. The report examined 1,189 of these species and found some 44% are in population decline. Perhaps the most shocking takeaway is the dire state of the world’s migratory fish species: Ninety-seven percent are facing extinction. Migratory reptiles are also in trouble, with 70% threatened. Overexploitation and habitat loss due to human activity are the largest pressures contributing to these losses. “These animals are, first and foremost, part of the ecosystems where they’re found,” CMS executive secretary Amy Fraenkel <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=4c4d93c5ff&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> CNN. “And we have a lot of evidence showing that if you remove these species, if they decline, it will have impacts on the ecosystems where they’re found, and not in a positive way.” Protecting migrating animals can be a challenge because it requires cross-border cooperation.

2. Another big U.S. oil merger will create Permian Basin drilling giant
</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Diamondback Energy announced a $26 billion deal to buy Endeavor Energy Resources, the largest private oil company in America’s biggest oil field, the Permian Basin. The deal catapults Diamondback to the third spot on the list of the region’s largest oil and gas producers. This is “the latest in a flurry of large-scale merger and acquisition activity in the U.S. shale patch as companies look to snap up the best remaining drilling acreage,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e7530daccb&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a> the <em>Financial Times</em>.

3. Study raises new concerns about ocean current tipping point

Climate researchers have long worried that global warming could someday cause the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) to slow or stop. This would trigger major shifts in regional climates and devastate ecosystems, but such an event has always been hard to predict, and most forecasts saw it occuring centuries in the future, if at all. For this new study, researchers used a supercomputer to run through potential warming scenarios and were able to trigger a collapse in the model AMOC, confirming there is indeed a point at which the system breaks down. While the team couldn’t pinpoint when this collapse could happen, they <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=1802e6613f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">say</a> the findings suggest “we are moving in the direction of the tipping point.” If AMOC <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=77e1c01249&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were to shut down</a>, parts of Europe, North America, and Asia could see temperatures drop, the southern hemisphere could warm, and Atlantic sea levels could rise by a meter, all within a short timespan that would make adaptation almost impossible, <em>The Guardian</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=48ce816896&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.

They are no longer exposed to fuel costs. Producers can focus on the health of the plants/animals, and truly optimize the material inputs such as fertilizers, chemicals, and feeds.” It mentions reduced CO2 emissions, too, but only briefly, suggesting John Deere thinks the key to encouraging farmers to swap out their legacy equipment is to focus on operational improvements rather than environmental benefits.

The film, which hits theaters in July, isn’t a remake of the 1996 <em>Twister</em>, but more of a follow up.

## Forcing AI on developers is a bad idea that is going to happen

<h4>We’ve still got time to make it better before it does</h4> <p><strong>Opinion</strong>  There is a thing that companies do, a pathological behavior that makes customers unhappy and makes things worse in general.

## Biden Says He Is Pushing for Six-Week Gaza Pause

date: 2024-02-12, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden said on Monday that the United States was pushing for a six-week pause in the fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza as a steppingstone toward a longer cease-fire.


Biden and Jordan's King Abdullah spoke after the two longtime allies held talks in the White House residence. Their discussions covered a daunting list of challenges, including a looming Israeli ground offensive in southern Gaza and the threat of a humanitarian calamity among Palestinian civilians.


Biden, who has shown increasing exasperation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for not heeding his advice, said the United States was working with allies in the region on a deal to pause the fighting to allow Gaza hostages to be freed and the flow of humanitarian assistance to increase.




The deal would start with a pause in fighting of at least six weeks, during which officials could try "to build something more enduring," Biden said.


Taking the lectern after Biden spoke, Abdullah renewed his appeal for a broad cease-fire.


"We cannot stand by and let this continue," he said. "We need a lasting cease-fire now. This war must end."


The meeting came as Biden has become increasingly vocal in his demand that Israel not undertake a ground offensive in Gaza's southern city of Rafah without a plan to protect Palestinian civilians.


Biden spoke with Netanyahu on Sunday, and the White House said he stressed that "a military operation in Rafah should not proceed without a credible and executable plan for ensuring the safety of and support for the more than 1 million people sheltering there."


Before embarking on a tour of Western capitals, Abdullah participated in an airdrop of humanitarian aid to Gaza, a move that highlighted his kingdom's role in pushing Israel to stop restricting efforts to fend off illness, hunger and starvation in the enclave.


Biden's team has been trying to negotiate a pause in the fighting in order to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas since the Palestinian militant group that governs Gaza launched an attack in southern Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people.


Palestinian health officials estimate that more than 28,000 people in Gaza have been killed in Israel's offensive against Hamas fighters.

## Housekeeping

date: 2024-02-12, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>First housekeeping post of 2024. Hope you all had a great beginning of the year. As usual, a couple of things in no particular order:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://peopleandblogs.com">People and Blogs</a> is about to hit 25 interviews. There’s 52 weeks in a year so we’re almost half way through year one. I’m happy to see that people are enjoying the series. Makes me so happy.</li>
<li>Running Minimalissimo is fun. I’ve already coded a few things for the site—a <a href="https://minimalissimo.com/articles/books-and-a-new-navigation">new navigation</a>, a new <a href="https://minimalissimo.com/articles/stream">stream</a> section and also a new books page—and I have plenty of other things I want to do.</li>
<li>My <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/one-a-month">one a month experiment</a> is a tiny success. Kind people are still out there and I think it’s important to try support a more sane web in a sustainable way.</li>
<li>I’m hosting the <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/indieweb-carnival-digital-relationships">IndieWeb Carnival this month</a>. You can find the first 15 submissions at the link above and you have time until February 28th to send yours.</li>
<li>I’m redesigning my blog. It’s not a true redesign, it will feel very familiar if you visited this site over the past 5 or 6 years. Structure will stay pretty much the same but I felt the need to tweak a few things here and there. I’m also going to reintroduce a web font. I was in my 20s the last time I used one on this site. Gonna be fun.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s all I have for this February housekeeping. As always my inbox is open if you want to get in touch. Have a great day.</p>

## February 11, 2024 

date: 2024-02-12, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

On February 12, 1809, Nancy Hanks Lincoln gave birth to her second child, a son: Abraham. Abraham Lincoln grew up to become the nation&#8217;s sixteenth president, leading the country from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865, a little over a month into his second term. He piloted the country through the Civil War, preserving the concept of American democracy. It was a system that had never been fully realized but that he still saw as &#8220;the last, best hope of earth&#8221; to prove that people could govern themselves.

## NYC Imposing Curfew at More Migrant Shelters Following Recent Violent Incidents

date: 2024-02-12, from: VOA News USA

New York — New York is expanding a curfew to additional migrant shelters after violent incidents attributed to migrant shelter residents gained national attention in recent weeks.


Mayor Eric Adams' administration will impose an 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew at 20 migrant shelters starting Monday, after initially placing the restrictions at four other locations, spokesperson Kayla Mamelak said Sunday.


The curfew impacts about 3,600 migrants, with the largest of the emergency centers housing nearly 1,000 migrants in Long Island City, Queens, according to a listing provided by the mayor's office.


City officials initially placed a curfew on four shelters last month in response to neighborhood complaints.


Mamelak said the curfews are in line with restrictions already in place at NYC's traditional homeless shelters and allow for "more efficient capacity management" of migrants in the city's care.




"New York City continues to lead the nation in managing this national humanitarian crisis, and that includes prioritizing the health and safety of both asylum seekers in our care and New Yorkers who live in the communities surrounding the emergency shelters we manage," she said in an emailed statement.


The additional curfews come after a spate of migrant-related violence and crime has prompted increasingly dire rhetoric from city and police officials.


A 15-year-old teen from Venezuela was arrested Friday for opening fire in Times Square while fleeing from police after being stopped by security for suspected shoplifting. The shooting injured a tourist from Brazil.


A video showing a group of migrants brawling with police in Times Square last month also went viral and led to several arrests.


The total of 24 migrant shelters now subject to the restrictions represents a fraction of the more than 200 such facilities the city operates to house some 66,000 newly arrived asylum seekers.
