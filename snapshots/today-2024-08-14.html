<p>If you don’t buy the
<a href="https://this.how/newRulesForJournalists/">new rules for
journalism</a> because the liars will tell lies about you, the
journalist – well, you get that either way, no matter what you do, so I
don’t see the problem. And if you want people to trust you, you’ve got
to tell the truth. Your reputation gets destroyed by their lies if you
pass them through. Doctors <s>can</s> must tell you to stop smoking to
save your life and the tobacco companies will accuse them of lying or
whatever and some people (such as myself, earlier in life) will continue
to smoke. You still have to do what’s right if you want people to trust
you.</p>

<p>
Starbucks has hired Brian Niccol to become its new CEO following a slump
in the company’s sales in Q3. Niccol took over Chipotle in 2018, and
Chipotle’s stock price has shot up 700% under his tenure. Before that,
Niccol led a brand revamp at Taco Bell. We’ll hear more. Then, consumer
inflation is easing toward the Federal Reserve’s target, and Montreal
makes a bet on nightlife by permitting all-night drinking.

<h2 id="harris-makes-me-proud">Harris makes me proud</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-14, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I am so impressed with how well the new Democratic Party is running this
campaign. Latest innovation, they’re going to do at least one public
rally during the convention, so everyone can be part of the celebration,
and I plan to watch every minute of it. What I don’t want to witness is
what the journalists try to provoke. I’ve been to two DNCs and later
heard what they were talking about on CNN, and my god they invented
crises that simply didn’t exist. Who’s going to have time to call them
out because no one at the convention is watching TV.
</p>
<p>
I heard on a podcast yesterday that it’s weird that Harris is polling as
well as the
<a href="https://www.advisorperspectives.com/commentaries/2021/11/23/the-generic-ballot-what-to-know-why-its-so-important">generic</a>
Democrat, which they felt was odd because she’s not a white man, which
made me think that in 2024, she is the face of the Democratic Party.
Obama and Hillary Clinton knocked down those barriers, and now it would
feel strange if the candidate at the top of the ticket were not
interracial and female.
</p>
<p>
I’m proud that my country has nominated such an attractive group of
talented people with such fierce competence and humility. For these
moments I wish I had a new graphic to put in the margin to symbolize the
United States. We’re strong, and we win, and when we don’t we get back
up and fight. Uncle Sam is a great symbol. But we’ve yet to create the
interracial and female version that symbol.
</p>
<p>
One more thing, there are a lot of white male voters to be courted and
welcomed back into the fold. Trump has had the advantage there, but it
doesn’t have to be that way. A hand reached out in brotherhood could
turn this election into the kind of landslide we need to cleanse our
political system its flirtation with fascism.

id="judge-rejects-trumps-latest-demand-to-step-aside-from-hush-money-criminal-case">Judge
rejects Trump’s latest demand to step aside from hush money criminal
case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Donald Trump has lost his latest bid for a new judge in
his New York hush money criminal case as it heads toward a key ruling
and potential sentencing next month. </p>
<p>In a decision posted Wednesday, Judge Juan M. Merchan declined to
step aside and said Trump’s demand was a rehash “rife with inaccuracies
and unsubstantiated claims” about the political ties of Mercan’s
daughter and his ability to judge the historic case fairly and
impartially. </p>
<p>It is the third time that the judge has rejected such a request from
lawyers for the former president and current Republican nominee. </p>
<p>All three times, they argued that Merchan, a state court judge in
Manhattan, has a conflict of interest because of his daughter’s work as
a political consultant for prominent Democrats and campaigns. Among them
was Vice President Kamala Harris when she ran for president in 2020. She
is now her party’s 2024 White House nominee. </p>
<p>A state court ethics panel said last year that Merchan could continue
on the case, writing that a relative’s independent political activities
are not “a reasonable basis to question the judge’s impartiality.” </p>
<p>Merchan has repeatedly said he is certain he will continue to base
his rulings “on the evidence and the law, without fear or favor, casting
aside undue influence.” </p>
<p>“With these fundamental principles in mind, this Court now reiterates
for the third time, that which should already be clear — innuendo and
mischaracterizations do not a conflict create,” Merchan wrote in his
three-page ruling. “Recusal is therefore not necessary, much less
required.” </p>
<p>But with Harris now Trump’s Democratic opponent in this year’s White
House election, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche wrote in a letter to the judge
last month that the defense’s concerns have become “even more
concrete.” </p>
<p>Prosecutors called the claims “a vexatious and frivolous attempt to
relitigate” the issue. </p>
<p>Messages seeking comment on the ruling were left with Blanche. The
Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>Trump was convicted in May of falsifying his business records to
conceal a 2016 deal to pay off porn actor Stormy Daniels to stay quiet
about her alleged 2006 sexual encounter with him. Prosecutors cast the
payout as part of a Trump-driven effort to keep voters from hearing
salacious stories about him during his first campaign. </p>
<p>Trump says all the stories were false, the business records were not
and the case was a political maneuver meant to damage his current
campaign. The prosecutor who brought the charges, Manhattan District
Attorney Alvin Bragg, is a Democrat. </p>
<p>Trump has pledged to appeal. Legally, that cannot happen before a
defendant is sentenced. </p>
<p>In the meantime, his lawyers took other steps to try to derail the
case. Besides the recusal request, they have asked Merchan to overturn
the verdict and dismiss the case altogether because of the U.S. Supreme
Court’s July ruling on presidential immunity. </p>
<p>That decision reins in prosecutions of ex-presidents for official
acts and restricts prosecutors in pointing to official acts as evidence
that a president’s unofficial actions were illegal. Trump’s lawyers
argue that in light of the ruling, jurors in the hush money case should
not have heard such evidence as former White House staffers describing
how the then-president reacted to news coverage of the Daniels
deal. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, Merchan set a September 16 date to rule on the
immunity claim, and September 18 for “the imposition of sentence or
other proceedings as appropriate.” </p>
<p>The hush money case is one of four criminal prosecutions brought
against Trump last year. </p>
<p>One federal case, accusing Trump of illegally hoarding classified
documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, was dismissed last month.
The Justice Department is appealing. </p>
<p>The others — federal and Georgia state cases concerning Trump’s
efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss — are not positioned to go to
trial before the November election.</p>

2024-08-14 Web applications
</h1>
<p>
For my own peace of mind, I have resolved to no longer think of websites
as “websites”. Instead, there are <em>web documents</em> and <em>web
applications</em>. I find it easier to accept to use a browser like
Firefox like a virtual computer for web applications. Many of the
websites these days are in fact web applications.
</p>
<p>
There’s no point in railing against web applications. I like to write
web applications! And I use many of them myself, too. Things like
<a href="Face_Generator">Face Generator</a>, <a href="Text_Mapper">Text
Mapper</a> or <a href="Hex_Describe">Hex Describe</a> are impossible to
do as documents. In an emergency, you could have a form that then
generates a PDF to download, maybe? But is that really preferable? I
don’t think so.
</p>
<p>
And don’t get me started on writing native graphical user-interface
applications. It takes so much energy to get it right. It gives me a
headache. I tried. Take a look at
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/gridmapper-local.git/">Gridmapper
with Common Lisp and SDL2</a>, if you want. Compare it with regular
<a href="Gridmapper">Gridmapper</a>. Is that really preferable? I don’t
think so.
</p>
<p>
And the reverse is also not cool. I wrote a text user interface tool to
generate maps, which can then be downloaded as SVG files. Give
<a href="Hex_Populate">Hex Populate</a> a try, it works over SSH. Is
that really preferable? I don’t think so.
</p>
<p>
I’ve tried Gemtext for a long time. I was very much into
<a href="Gemini">Gemini</a>. But these days I no longer think it’s the
answer. It’s like a piece of performance art: the doing of it is a
statement. People who step into it are confounded, their beliefs
challenged. It’s good art! It’s interesting technology. But it’s not a
replacement for <em>web applications</em>. It’s not even a good format
for <em>web documents</em>! I want inline emphasis – bold, italics, code
– and accessible tables with captions and cell navigation, and
row-spans, and column-spans. I tried writing code that translated
Wikipedia tables into ASCII tables to be used as pre-formatted text in
Gemtext. It’s hard to do well with the sizing of columns, the line
wrapping in cells, the limited space available in a terminal, and when
you’ve solved all of that, it’s still hell for people with bad eye-sight
or cognitive problems trying to understand what they’re seeing. It’s
terrible. You could of course do away with all tables. But is that
really preferable? I don’t think so.
</p>
<p>
And so… there’s that bifurcation in the road. For this site, for most of
the pages that I think of as <em>web documents</em>, I write (or
generate) HTML that doesn’t require fonts or scripts. If one uses
browsers such as eww, links2, w3m, lynx or dillo, it should just work. I
wasn’t going to convert the corporate web, anyway.
</p>
<p>
I still serve my site as Gemini and Gopher. But I do it as a political
statement, as a piece of performance art.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, I swallow my pride and

<li>IRA has helped create more than 334,000 new jobs
</h3>
<p>
Ahead of the upcoming two-year anniversary of the Inflation Reduction
Act, the nonprofit Climate Power released a new report analyzing the
economic impact of the clean energy investments made possible by the
legislation. The topline takeaway: Since August 2022, 646 clean energy
projects have been either announced or advanced, creating 334,565 new
jobs. Battery manufacturing projects account for the largest share of
the new projects, followed by solar projects and EV facilities.

</p>
<p>
Most of the new projects are located in five states (Michigan, Texas,
Georgia, California, and South Carolina) and in congressional districts
represented by Republicans in the House of Representatives. These
districts alone have seen the creation of 190,727 new jobs and more than
$286 billion in clean-energy investment. Projects in low-income
communities have brought $114 billion in investment to those areas and
created more than 134,000 jobs. The report notes that clean energy jobs
tend to pay more, and that most of them do not require a four-year
degree, “meaning they’re accessible to all Americans.” Aside from
highlighting the “clean energy boom,” the report warns that a second
Trump presidency could halt the progress.

<li>Vineyard Wind can resume ‘limited activites’ at wind farm, but no

<p>
Just a little update on the situation at the Vineyard Wind 1 site off
the coast of Massachusetts, where activity has been paused since July
because of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/vineyard-wind-answers" rel="noopener" target="_self">a
broken turbine blade</a>: Following a safety consultation, the Bureau of
Safety and Environmental Enforcement has told Vineyard Wind it
<a href="https://nantucket-ma.gov/3259/Week-5-August-12---18" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">can
resume some limited activities</a>, like installing turbine towers and
nacelles (the container at the top of the tower where the generator,
gearbox, and other key components are located). But it cannot install
any new turbine blades, or resume power production. Vineyard Wind and
the blade’s manufacturer, GE Vernova, this week did some
<a href="https://www.vineyardwind.com/press-releases/2024/8/9/incident-response-and-action-plan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“controlled
cutting”</a> on the damaged turbine to prevent more debris from falling
into the ocean. Now they’re looking ahead to next steps, like removing
the blade root and figuring out what to do with the big pieces of debris
that fell to the seabed. Before the incident, the partially-constructed
commercial offshore wind farm was already sending power to the grid.

<p>
Climate change is making forest fires more frequent and more
destructive,
<a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/global-trends-forest-fires" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to the World Resources Institute</a>. By examining data provided by
researchers at the University of Maryland, the WRI concluded that the
area consumed by fire annually has grown by 5.4% each year since 2001,
and “record-setting forest fires are becoming the norm.” In 2023 alone,
the amount of land affected by forest fires was 23% larger than the
previous record year. Most of the tree cover loss due to fires is
happening in the boreal forests, which is worrying because these forests
store between 30% and 40% of the world’s terrestrial carbon.

The growing number of fires is creating a climate feedback loop: More
burning releases more carbon dioxide which creates hotter and drier
conditions that are conducive to more fires, and on and on it goes.
Aside from emphasizing the need to rapidly curb greenhouse gas
emissions, the report calls for ending deforestation, and better
wildfire risk management.

In a
<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ad6018" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paper</a>
published in the journal<em> Environmental Research Letters</em>,
scientists say the rate of global warming – that is how quickly the
planet is heating up – looks like it will slow in the coming decades. In
2025, the rate of warming is expected to be about .38 degrees Fahrenheit
each decade, but this will fall to an increase of .27 degrees Fahrenheit
per decade by 2050. Those estimates are based on current mitigation
policies, and the researchers say the rate could slow even more if we
curb fossil fuel emissions more aggressively. There are a lot of caveats
and moving parts here, and the researchers are upfront about this,
noting that factors like El Niño, fluctuations in aerosol emissions, and
the fact that “climate damage may show a non-linear response to amounts
of climate change” could render their projections inaccurate.
Nonetheless, “various analyses suggest that under current mitigation
policies we are at or near a time of peak anthropogenic carbon
emissions.”

becomes a hurricane after brushing past Puerto Rico</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Tropical Storm Ernesto has become a hurricane
after brushing past Puerto Rico late Tuesday as officials closed
schools, opened shelters and moved dozens of the U.S. territory’s
endangered parrots into hurricane-proof rooms.</p>
<p>Forecasters issued a hurricane watch for the U.S. and British Virgin
Islands as well as the tiny Puerto Rican islands of Vieques and Culebra,
which are popular with tourists.</p>
<p>The storm moved over the U.S. Virgin Islands on Tuesday night. After
passing Puerto Rico, it is expected to move into open waters and be near
Bermuda on Friday.</p>
<p>Heavy rains began pelting Puerto Rico, and strong winds churned the
ocean into a milky turquoise as people rushed to finish securing homes
and businesses.</p>
<p>“I’m hoping it will go away quickly,” said José Rodríguez, 36, as he
climbed on the roof of his uncle’s wooden shack in the Afro-Caribbean
community of Piñones on Puerto Rico’s north coast to secure the business
famous for its fried street food.</p>
<p>Ernesto was about 60 miles (95 kilometers) east-northeast of San
Juan, Puerto Rico late Tuesday night. It had maximum sustained winds of
65 mph (100 kph) and was moving northwest at 17 mph (28 kph).</p>
<p>“We are going to have a lot of rain,” Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro
Pierluisi said as he urged people to be indoors by early Tuesday
evening.</p>
<p>He activated the National Guard as crews across the island visited
flood-prone areas and older residents as part of last-minute
preparations. Meanwhile, Department of Natural Resources officials who
work at breeding centers for the island’s only remaining native parrot,
the Puerto Rico Amazon, moved them indoors.</p>
<p>Ernesto Rodríguez with the National Weather Service warned that the
storm’s trajectory could change as it approaches Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>“We should not lower our guard,” he said.</p>
<p>As intermittent rain pelted Puerto Rico’s northeast, residents in
Piñones tried to squeeze in a couple more hours of work.</p>
<p>María Abreu, 25, prepared fried pastries stuffed with shrimp, crab,
chicken and even iguana meat as she waited for customers.</p>
<p>“They always come. They buy them in case the power goes out,” she
said.</p>
<p>Down the road, Juan Pizarro, 65, picked nearly 100 coconuts from palm
trees swaying in the strong breeze. He had already secured his
house.</p>
<p>“I’m ready for anything,” he said.</p>
<p>Forecasters have warned of waves of up to 20 feet (six meters),
widespread flooding and possible landslides, with six to eight inches
(15-20 centimeters) of rain forecast for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands, and up to 10 inches (25 centimeters) in isolated areas. Puerto
Rico has six reservoirs that already were overflowing before the
storm.</p>
<p>Officials in Puerto Rico warned of widespread power outages given the
crumbling electric grid, which crews are still repairing after Hurricane
Maria razed it in September 2017 as a Category 4 storm.</p>
<p>Juan Saca, president of Luma Energy, a private company that operates
the transmission and distribution of power in Puerto Rico, urged people
to report blackouts: “Puerto Rico’s electrical system is not
sufficiently modernized to detect power outages.”</p>
<p>Outages also were a concern in the neighboring U.S. Virgin Islands
for similar reasons, with blackouts reported on St. Thomas and St. John
on Monday.</p>
<p>“Don’t sleep on this,” said U.S. Virgin Islands Gov. Albert Bryan
Jr., whose administration announced early Tuesday that it was closing
all schools.</p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency echoed those warnings,
saying residents in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands “should be
prepared for extended power outages.”</p>
<p>Early Tuesday, Ernesto drenched the French Caribbean island of
Guadeloupe, where officials closed several main roads and warned that
the quality of potable water would be affected for several days.
Meanwhile, the storm downed a couple of trees in Antigua, and knocked
out power to most of the island. Ernesto also forced the cancellation of
dozens of flights to and from Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Ernesto is the fifth named storm of this year’s Atlantic hurricane
season.</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an
above-average Atlantic hurricane season this year because of record warm
ocean temperatures. It forecast 17 to 25 named storms, with four to
seven major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher.</p>

<p>date: 2024-08-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS — Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, one of the progressive
House members known as the “Squad” and a sharp critic of how Israel has
conducted the war in Gaza, has won her primary race in Minnesota.</p>
<p>Omar successfully defended her Minneapolis-area 5th District seat
against a repeat challenge from former Minneapolis City Council member
Don Samuels, a more centrist liberal whom she only narrowly defeated in
the 2022 primary.</p>
<p>Speaking to supporters in Minneapolis, Omar echoed some of the themes
of the Harris-Walz presidential campaign.</p>
<p>“We run the politics of joy,” she said. “Because we know it is joyful
to fight for your neighbors. … We know it is joyful to make sure housing
is a human right. We know it is joyful to fight for health care to be a
human right. We know it is joyful to want to live in a peaceful and
equitable world.”</p>
<p>Omar avoided the fate of two fellow Squad members. Rep. Cori Bush
lost the Democratic nomination in her Missouri district last week, and
Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York lost his primary in June. Both faced
well-funded challengers and millions of dollars in spending by the
United Democracy Project, a super political action committee affiliated
with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which appeared to sit
out the Minnesota race.</p>
<p>Samuels had criticized Omar’s condemnation of the Israeli
government’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war. While Omar has also
criticized Hamas for attacking Israel and taking hostages, Samuels said
she’s one-sided and divisive. He also stressed public safety issues in
Minneapolis, where a former police officer murdered George Floyd in
2020.</p>
<p>Samuels said he was “very disappointed” with his loss.</p>
<p>“What I was hoping is that a strong ground game and an attention to
the details of folks who felt left out would trump an overwhelming
superiority in dollars,” he said in an interview. “Clearly money matters
a little more in politics than I had hoped.”</p>
<p>Omar reported raising about $6.2 million. Samuels raised about $1.4
million.</p>
<p>Omar will face Republican Dalia Al-Aqidi, an Iraqi American
journalist and self-described secular Muslim who calls Omar
pro-Hamas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, conservative populist and former NBA player Royce White
defeated Navy veteran Joe Fraser in Minnesota’s primary election for the
Republican nomination to challenge Democratic U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar in
November.</p>
<p>And former federal prosecutor Joe Teirab, supported by former
President Donald Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson and the National
Republican Congressional Committee, won a contested GOP primary for
Minnesota’s 2nd District seat held by Democratic Rep. Angie Craig.</p>
<p>His opponent, defense attorney Tayler Rahm, won the endorsement at
the district convention with support from grassroots conservatives.</p>
<p>While Rahm announced in July that he was suspending his campaign and
would instead serve as a senior adviser for Trump’s Minnesota campaign,
he remained on the ballot.</p>
<p>Teirab will face Craig in what’s expected to be Minnesota’s most
competitive House race in November.</p>
<p>“Tonight’s definitive results send a clear message that Republicans
are united and ready for change,” Teirab said in a statement. “We are
ready to support candidates who will strengthen our economy, secure the
border, and restore safety in our communities.”</p>
<p>Craig issued a statement calling him “a guy who recently moved to the
district because he saw a political opportunity.”</p>
<p>“He’s a guy who has spent months doing anything to win the support of
Washington Republicans,” Craig said. “And he’s a guy who has made it his
life’s mission to take away reproductive freedoms from families and give
those decisions to politicians.”</p>
<p>In the U.S. Senate race, White — an ally of imprisoned former Trump
aide Steve Bannon and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones — shocked many
political observers when he defeated Fraser at the party convention for
the GOP endorsement.</p>
<p>White’s social media comments have been denounced as misogynistic,
homophobic, antisemitic and profane. His legal and financial problems
include unpaid child support and questionable campaign spending,
including $1,200 spent at a Florida strip club after he lost his primary
challenge to Omar in 2022. He argues that, as a Black man, he can
broaden the party’s base by appealing to voters of color in the
Minneapolis-St. Paul area and others disillusioned with establishment
politics.</p>
<p>Following his win, White said in a post on the social platform X:
“Bring it on commies… The People Are Coming.”</p>
<p>Democratic leaders denounced him as a far-right extremist.</p>
<p>“While Royce White’s language and policies seek to divide
Minnesotans, Senator Amy Klobuchar is focused on bringing people
together to get things done, and she is consistently ranked as one of
the most bipartisan and effective legislators in the Senate,” Ken
Martin, the state Democratic Party chair, said in a statement. “The
choice this November could not be more clear.”</p>
<p>Fraser said earlier that White’s confrontational style and message
won’t attract the moderates and independents needed for a competitive
challenge against Klobuchar, who’s seeking a fourth term. He said he
offered a more mainstream approach, stressing fiscal conservativism, a
strong defense, world leadership and small government. Fraser has also
highlighted his 26 years in the Navy, where he was an intelligence
officer and served a combat tour in Iraq.</p>
<p>Neither had anywhere near the resources that Klobuchar has. White
last reported raising $133,000, while Fraser took in $68,000. Klobuchar,
meanwhile, has collected about $19 million this cycle and has more than
$6 million available to spend on the general election campaign. She
faced only nominal primary opposition.</p>
<p>Another clash between establishment and grassroots Republicans played
out in western Minnesota’s 7th District. Trump-backed GOP Rep. Michelle
Fischbach, considered one of the most conservative members of Congress,
defeated small businessman Steve Boyd. Boyd ran to her right on a
religious platform and blocked her from getting endorsement at the
district convention. Boyd reported spending $170,000, while Fischbach
spent over $1 million.</p>
<p>Among the legislative primaries on the ballot Tuesday, Democrats
picked former state Sen. Ann Johnson Stewart to face Republican Kathleen
Fowke in a high-stakes race that will determine not only which party
controls the state Senate, but whether Democrats maintain their narrow
“trifecta” control of both chambers and the governor’s office. Democrats
used that power to pass an ambitious agenda over the last two years that
helped put Gov. Tim Walz on the radar of Vice President Kamala Harris
before she picked him to be her running mate.</p>
<p>It will be the only state Senate seat in the November ballot. The
seat in the western Minneapolis suburbs had been held by Democrat Kelly
Morrison, who will face Republican Tad Jude for Minnesota’s 3rd
Congressional District seat.</p>

Treasury’s No. 2 Official Wants Permitting Reform</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-14, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzE3MTE4OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMjY0MjUyMn0.cOlqi7DMzK-UplZ6w6Gq4XuN2tdcMjVf6L0ObEzl9Do/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Two years ago this week, President Joe Biden signed the Inflation
Reduction Act, the largest investment in clean energy and climate
mitigation in American history. It contained roughly two dozen new or
expanded tax credits that will — if the forecasts bear out — provide
hundreds of billions of dollars in funding over the next decade. The
administration is now rushing to finalize those provisions before the
November election.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps no official has been more central to setting up those tax
credits than
<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/Wally-Adeyemo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Wally
Adeyemo</u></a>, the deputy secretary of the U.S. Treasury Department.
He is also the Treasury’s No. 2 official and chief operating officer.
Adeyemo has led the agency’s effort to implement the climate law,
overseeing a group of tax lawyers and political appointees who are
critical to the legislation’s ultimate success. He joins Shift Key this
week to help us kick off our second season and talk about how the effort
to implement the climate law is going, what could stand in its way, and
why he wants some kind of permitting reform.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer:</strong> So obviously, one of the huge risks for
investors is that the IRA is repealed, in part or in full, in the next
Congress. And we know, just as a fact, that Congress is going to have to
do something on taxes. Next Congress, the Trump tax cuts are expiring,
there’s going to be, there’s interest in doing something with a child
tax credit. It’s going to really come down to who has control of the two
chambers. <br/> <br/> How are you thinking about, as a Democratic
administration, protecting the IRA going into a very ambiguous 2025
environment, and how are companies who you talk to thinking through that
quite large political risk around the threat of repeal next year?<br/>
<br/> <strong>Wally Adeyemo: </strong>So maybe I’ll break it down into
two different types of tax credits, the business tax credits and the
consumer-oriented tax credits. When it comes to business tax credits, as
you both know from following this for a while, those don’t usually go
away. Because ultimately, what happens is that, for these businesses,
they do a fairly good job of making clear to members how those tax
credits are tied to jobs that end up being in their districts. <br/>
<br/> One of the things that I’m proudest of is, when you look at the
dispersion of projects tied to the IRA throughout the country, it puts
us in a place where a number of people who voted for — and even, in some
cases, many who didn’t vote for — the IRA now have significant projects
being funded by the IRA happening in their districts, that they’re
hiring people based on IRA-related projects, and it’s driving real
economic activity. So when it comes to these business tax credits, my
sense is that there’s going to be a case for keeping them, independent
from the climate goals, which they’re helping to achieve because of the
fact that they’re creating jobs in these districts that are helping to
power those local economies. <br/> <br/> On the consumer tax credits —
and just today, I think we’re speaking on August 7, we put out a report
about more than 3 million Americans claiming a set of consumer-oriented
credits to help install things like solar panels on their homes, and
heat pumps. And on these credits — they existed before the IRA. And
frankly, what we did with the IRA was, we further incentivized people
and created some flexibility within these credits. <br/> <br/> These
credits existed in the last administration. They’ve existed during the
Obama administration. So the reality is that for some of these
consumer-oriented credits and some of the business-oriented credits,
they had both existed in Republican administrations. There have been
Republicans who have supported them. For example, when you think about
the wind credits, there have been a number of senators from the Midwest,
both Democrats and Republicans, who have been huge advocates for them
because they matter to their district. <br/> <br/> So from my
standpoint, the most important thing we can do to preserve the IRA is to
make sure that we get these rules done as quickly as possible, so that
not only businesses but individuals start to rely on them. They help,
from my standpoint, address the climate crisis that we face. But from
the standpoint of consumers, they help lower their cost. And the report
we put out today showed that for some consumers installing a heat pump,
for example, it lowered the cost of utilities by up to $3,000 a year.
The more that happens, the more people who take advantage of it, the
more likely that those tax credits are going to remain. And I think
that’s also true for the business tax credit. So that’s the strategy,
and I think that it’s one that’s been borne out by other business and
consumer tax credits in the past.

approves $20 billion in weapons sales to Israel amid threat of wider
Middle East war</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. has approved $20 billion in arms sales to
Israel, including scores of fighter jets and advanced air-to-air
missiles, the State Department announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>Congress was notified of the impending sale, which includes more than
50 F-15 fighter jets, Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles, or
AMRAAMs, 120 mm tank ammunition and high explosive mortars and tactical
vehicles and comes at a time of intense concern that Israel may become
involved in a wider Middle East war.</p>
<p>However, the weapons are not expected to get to Israel anytime soon,
they are contracts that will take years to fulfill. Much of what is
being sold is to help Israel increase its military capability in the
long term, the earliest systems being delivered under the contract
aren’t expected until the 2026 timeframe.</p>
<p>“The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is
vital to U.S. national interests to assist Israel to develop and
maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability. This proposed sale
is consistent with those objectives,” the State Department said in a
release on the sale.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has had to balance its continued support for
Israel with a growing number of calls from lawmakers and the U.S. public
to curb military support there due to the high number of civilian deaths
in Gaza. It has curbed one delivery of 2,000-pound weapons amid
continued airstrikes by Israel in densely populated civilian areas in
Gaza.</p>
<p>The contracts will cover not only the sale of 50 new aircraft to be
produced by Boeing. It will also include upgrade kits for Israel to
modify its existing fleet of two dozen F-15 fighter jets with new
engines and radars, among other upgrades. The jets comprise the biggest
portion of the $20 billion in sales with the first deliveries expected
in 2029.</p>

Iran-backed attack injured 8 US troops in Syria</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>pentagon — Eight U.S. service members in Syria were injured in a
drone attack by Iranian-backed militants last week, Pentagon press
secretary Major General Pat Ryder said on Tuesday. </p>
<p>Tuesday marked the first time that the Pentagon blamed Iranian
proxies for Friday’s attack.  </p>
<p>“We assess that it was conducted by Iranian-backed militia, but we’re
still digging into the specifics,” Ryder said in response to a question
from VOA at a Pentagon briefing. </p>
<p>Ryder told reporters the service members had been treated for smoke
inhalation and traumatic brain injury. Three of the injured troops have
returned to duty, he added.  </p>
<p>Earlier, the U.S. military said several American and coalition
personnel had been wounded in a drone attack late Friday at Rumalyn
Landing Zone in eastern Syria but stressed that “none of the injuries
are life threatening.” </p>
<p>The United States has about 900 troops in Syria and 2,500 in
neighboring Iraq to advise and assist local forces working to prevent a
resurgence of the Islamic State terror group in the region.  </p>
<p>The drone strike in Syria marked the second time this month that U.S.
military personnel in the Middle East had been injured in attacks. Five
Americans were injured in a rocket attack against al-Asad air base
August 5 in Iraq, with three transported to Landstuhl Regional Medical
Center in Germany for further care, according to deputy Pentagon press
secretary Sabrina Singh.  </p>
<p>Iranian-backed militias have launched dozens of attacks against U.S.
forces in the region since Israel began its military campaign in Gaza in
response to Hamas’ deadly October 7 terror attacks.</p>

<h2 id="democrats-are-energized-but-can-harris-win">Democrats are
energized, but can Harris win?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Since replacing President Joe Biden as the Democratic
presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris has quickly
consolidated power and energized a campaign that many Democrat leaders
had worried about.</p>
<p>Meeting no meaningful challenge from other Democrats, Harris secured
votes to be the nominee from 4,567 delegates — 99% of the participating
delegates — in a virtual call earlier this month. </p>
<p>The campaign, together with the Democratic National Committee and
other joint fundraising committees, raised a historic $310 million in
July, dwarfing the tally for the Republican nominee, former President
Donald Trump, in the same month. More than $200 million of Harris’ haul
came during the first week of her candidacy. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We’ve seen a groundswell of support. The type of grassroots support
– organizing and fundraising — that wins elections,” said Kevin Munoz, a
Harris campaign spokesperson.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The campaign’s optimism is reflected in the polls. After another
series of very strong surveys in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin,
Harris now has a 55% chance of winning, said election data analyst Nate
Silver.</p>
<p>Silver gave Biden a 27% chance of winning when he was the Democratic
nominee.</p>
<p>However, the Trump campaign insists that the fundamentals of the race
have not changed.</p>
<p>“The Democrats deposing one Nominee for another does NOT change
voters discontent over the economy, inflation, crime, the open border,
housing costs not to mention concern over two foreign wars,” Trump
campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio said in a memo.</p>
<p>Harris’ “honeymoon” will soon end, he said. “While the public polls
may change in the short run and she may consolidate a bit more of the
Democrat base, Harris can’t change who she is or what she’s done.”</p>
<p>While the fundamentals have not changed, they were “being obstructed
by concern about Biden’s age and cognitive abilities,” said Larry
Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for
Politics.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump is as unpopular as ever, and now he has an opponent who
is much more appealing,” he told VOA. “Democrats are back in the
game.”</p>
<p>Battleground states</p>
<p>In the United States, elections are not determined by winning the
popular vote but by winning Electoral College votes, which are allotted
to each state roughly in proportion to its population. In all but two
states, the candidate getting the most votes in a state gets all its
Electoral College votes.</p>
<p>Harris’ team has been investing heavily in campaign infrastructure,
opening offices, recruiting new staff and enlisting tens of thousands of
volunteers in what is considered battleground or swing states that could
help determine the 2024 electoral victory — Michigan, Wisconsin,
Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia. </p>
<p>In 2020, those seven states were won by a margin of 3 percentage
points or less. Currently, Harris is polling slightly ahead but still
within the polling margin of error in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Trump
is ahead in Michigan, Nevada, Arizona and North Carolina. He is leading
by more than the polling error margin in Georgia.</p>
<p>Both Trump and Harris will be hard-pressed to win without
Pennsylvania, said Democratic strategist Julie Roginsky. Pennsylvania
has 19 Electoral College votes, the most of any swing state.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“They can each afford to lose it but would have to run the table in
most, if not all, of the other swing states, which include Arizona,
Wisconsin, Georgia, Michigan and North Carolina,” Roginsky told
VOA. </p>
<p>A candidate needs to secure at least 270 out of the 538 electoral
college votes to win. Ultimately, it comes down to winning more
Electoral College votes than your opponent, however you make that math
happen, said Kelly Dittmar, associate professor of political science at
Rutgers University-Camden.</p>
<p>“Winning swing states with a high number of Electoral College votes,
such as Michigan and Pennsylvania — both states where Democrats have
recently won statewide and where Biden won in 2020 — is one solid path
toward [Harris] achieving success,” Dittmar told VOA. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Michigan, a state with a large population of Arab Americans,
Harris will need to convince the more than 100,000 people, angry over
the Biden administration’s staunch support for Israel, who wrote
“uncommitted” on their primary ballots. Thirty members of the so-called
Uncommitted National Movement have earned delegate spots at the
Democratic National Convention in Chicago next week.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harris also inherits opposition from the “Abandon Biden” movement
over the same cause.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We are saying do not vote for those who are supporting or endorsing
what’s happening currently in Gaza,” Hudhayfah Ahmad, the campaign’s
media representative, told VOA. “Quite frankly, that applies to both
Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.” </p>
<p>Inflation and immigration </p>
<p>While Democrats’ enthusiasm has soared, Harris must deal with voters’
frustration over high inflation, a problem that Republicans blame on the
Biden-Harris administration.</p>
<p>Trump previously held a commanding lead among voters on key economic
issues, with various polls showing Americans think they will be better
off financially under Trump than Biden. </p>
<p>However, a survey conducted for the Financial Times and the
University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business published this week
found that 41% trust Trump to be better at handling the economy, while
42% believe Harris would be better – a figure up seven points from
Biden’s numbers in July.</p>
<p>Immigration is another weak spot for Biden, and by extension Harris.
The Trump campaign has sought to paint her as the nation’s “Border Czar”
responsible for the “invasion” of Central American migrants crossing
into the United States from the border with Mexico.</p>
<p>Her campaign is now aiming to present their candidate as someone who
is pro-immigration but tough in enforcing the law, by highlighting
Harris’ life story as the daughter of immigrants and experience as a
former attorney general of California, the state with the largest number
and share of immigrants.</p>
<p>“I was attorney general of a border state,” Harris said at a recent
rally in Arizona, a swing state where immigration is a top concern for
voters. “I went after the transnational gangs, the drug cartels and
human traffickers. I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won.”</p>
<p>Will she win in November? </p>
<p>In such a tight race in an ever-changing political environment,
analysts have avoided saying that any candidate’s path to victory is
clear.</p>
<p>The Harris campaign said they believe this will be a very close
election, decided by a very small number of voters, in just a few
states.</p>
<p>Even with this momentum, said Harris campaign spokesperson Munoz, “we
are the underdogs in this race, and we’re taking nothing for
granted.”</p>

Army analyst pleads guilty to selling military secrets to China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — A U.S. Army intelligence analyst on Tuesday pleaded
guilty to charges of conspiring to sell military secrets to China, the
Department of Justice said. </p>
<p>Korbein Schultz was charged in March with conspiracy to disclose
national defense information, exporting defense articles and technical
data without a license, and bribery of a public official. </p>
<p>Schultz, who held top secret clearance, conspired with an individual
who lived in Hong Kong — who he suspected of being associated with the
Chinese government — to collect national defense information, including
classified information and export-controlled technical data related to
U.S. military weapons systems, in exchange for money, according to
charging and plea documents.  </p>
<p>“Governments like China are aggressively targeting our military
personnel and national security information and we will do everything in
our power to ensure that information is safeguarded from hostile foreign
governments,” FBI Executive Assistant Director Robert Wells said in a
statement.  </p>
<p>Before he was arrested, Schultz sent dozens of sensitive and
restricted, but unclassified, military documents, the Department of
Justice said. </p>
<p>A document discussing the lessons learned by the Army from the
Russia-Ukraine war that it would apply in a defense of Taiwan, documents
relating to Chinese military tactics, and a document relating to U.S.
military satellites were among the items collected and sent by
Schultz. </p>
<p>Schultz was paid about $42,000 for the information, according to the
department.  </p>
<p>“By conspiring to transmit national defense information to a person
living outside the United States, this defendant callously put our
national security at risk to cash in on the trust our military placed in
him,” Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen said. </p>
<p>Schultz is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 23, 2025.</p>

strikes $150M blow against cancer in campaign to slash deaths</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — President Joe Biden on Tuesday visited Louisiana’s
infamous “Cancer Alley” to strike at what he identified as a top
priority of his dwindling presidency: announcing $150 million in
research funding toward the goal of dramatically reducing cancer deaths
in the United States.</p>
<p>The Cancer Moonshot is an initiative close to Biden’s heart. Both he
and first lady Jill Biden have had brushes with skin cancers. And in
2015, an aggressive brain cancer took the life of their eldest son,
Beau.</p>
<p>“We’re moving quickly,” Biden said of the initiative, which has a
goal of reducing the U.S. cancer death rate by at least half by 2047.
“Because we know that all families touched by cancer are in a race
against time.”</p>
<p>Cancer is the second-biggest cause of death worldwide. The National
Cancer Institute predicts that 2 million Americans will be diagnosed
this year with the immune-mediated disease, which can manifest in
organs, bone marrow and blood and which comes in hundreds of different
varieties.</p>
<p>“Cancer touches us all,” the first lady said. “When Joe and I lost
our son to brain cancer, we decided to turn our pain into purpose. We
wanted to help families like ours so that they won’t have to experience
this terrible loss, and as president, Joe has brought his own relentless
optimism to the Biden Cancer Moonshot to end cancer as we know it. It’s
ambitious, but it’s also within our reach – maybe not yet, but one day
soon.”</p>
<p>Biden launched the initiative when he was vice president. Since he
restored the program as president, the research agency he created has
invested more than $400 million in the cause.</p>
<p>Cancer advocates praised the move but stressed the need for long-term
engagement.</p>
<p>“We’ve made tremendous strides in how we prevent, detect, treat and
survive cancer, but there is still much work to be done to improve the
lives of those touched by this disease,” said Dr. Karen E. Knudsen, CEO
of the American Cancer Society and the American Cancer Society Cancer
Action Network.</p>
<p>“Cancer cases are estimated to hit an all-time high this year, and we
cannot relent in driving forward public policies that will address
this,” Knudsen said. “Funding more researchers across the country
focused on more effective and innovative treatments will bring us closer
to future cancer breakthroughs and ending cancer as we know it, for
everyone.”</p>
<p>And cancer is often compounded by environmental causes – such as
those in the 140-kilometer (85-mile) stretch of communities between
Baton Rouge and New Orleans, home to a string of major fossil fuel and
petrochemical operations.</p>
<p>Karl Minges, associate dean in the School of Health Sciences at the
University of New Haven, told VOA that while the disease itself doesn’t
discriminate, social factors often make it hit harder in lower-income
communities.</p>
<p>“Any time that money from the federal government and publicity is put
on a topic, I think it’s something that has the ability to actually make
a significant difference,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>And, he said, the fact that this federal money is going toward
research institutions – and not private pharmaceutical companies – means
the lessons learned can be shared well beyond the United States.</p>
<p>“The U.S. is always on sort of the cutting edge with regard to
[research and development] of new drugs and treatments and
methodologies,” he said.</p>
<p>“But by giving the money to the institutes, it’s sort of available as
public funding for researchers to access, and anytime that’s the case,
there’s an imperative, whether it’s a clinical trial or it’s a an
observational study, that the results are in the public domain, so that
can be then subsumed by other countries outside of the United States who
face similar issues,” Minges said.</p>

<h2 id="rooftop-solar-has-a-big-but-surprising-racial-disparity">Rooftop
Solar Has a Big — But Surprising — Racial Disparity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzE3MDMyOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MjcxOTQ0Nn0.ma5oQ39uIGbh8LucM-x22wv_BQx4m2Mcz1-KU8vj-5U/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Higher-income people are more likely to have solar panels on their
roofs.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/ira-tax-credit-data" target="_blank">This
fact</a> has underlined the nature of home solar adoption and is
responsible for any number of state, local, and now federal programs to
give lower-income people access to solar power, either through
subsidizing their own solar panels or letting them “subscribe” to solar
power generated elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
While this seems like an obviously sensible solution — the upfront cost
of solar can be around $15,000 to $20,000, and you typically need to own
a single family home to get it — it’s not quite as simple as those with
more money are more likely to get solar. When the University of Texas
economist Jackson Dorsey and Derek Wolfson looked at data provide by the
solar marketplace EnergySage, they found that, yes, those with higher
incomes are more likely to buy solar — but also that what solar
installers offered them and what they paid for it varied depending on
the demographics of the surrounding area.
</p>
<p>
“Econ 101, there’s usually two possible reasons why you might have lower
quantities in a market. One would be demand is lower, and the other
would be supply is lower,” Dorsey told me when I asked what had
motivated his research. While the data about high-income demand for
energy transition products like solar panels or electric vehicles is
plentiful, there had been less attention paid to supply-side reasons for
the disparities.
</p>
<p>
Dorsey and Wolfson looked at hundreds of thousands of bids for solar
installation placed in EnergySage’s 15 largest markets, including much
of urban California, New York City, Washington, D.C. and metro areas in
Florida, where prospective solar buyers are able to pick among bids from
installers. Unsurprisingly, lower-income buyers were less likely to
purchase home solar, received fewer bids overall, and, because they were
likely seeking smaller systems, paid more per watt than wealthier
buyers. (The researchers were able to match data from EnergySage with
census data to extract demographic information about potential customers
along with their location.)
</p>
<p>
What did stand out, however, is that
<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32814" target="_blank">Black
households in particular got fewer bids</a> and paid notably higher
prices, a disparity that could not be explained entirely by differences
in income. Low-income households were more likely to be in an area with
a lower cost of living, and therefore didn’t necessarily face higher
overall project costs because prices for <em>everything</em> tended to
be lower.
</p>
<p>
Black households, on the other hand, received fewer bids <em>and
then</em> face higher prices. “If you look at Black vs. white
households, Black households get about 8% higher prices,” Dorsey told
me. “On a $20,000 system, that would be $1,600.”
</p>
<p>
The reason, he determined, is not so much that installers don’t want to
serve people they know are Black. It’s that they don’t want to serve
neighborhoods they know are majority Black.
</p>
<p>
Dorsey put the difference down to “some kind of perceived higher cost of
doing business.” Part of it could be explained by installers setting up
shop in areas where they think they’ll find higher demand for their
services — high-income ones — and so Black neighborhoods, which are more
likely to be low-income, may be literally farther away and more
expensive to serve. According to the data Dorsey and Wolfson collected,
there are three installers within 10 miles of white households on
average, compared to two installers on average for Black households.
</p>
<p>
There could also, Dorsey said, “be some implicit preference that they
don’t want to go to those neighborhoods.” In the paper, Dorsey and
Wolfson write that “some sellers may prefer to serve certain households
or neighborhoods either because of intolerant views, crime rates, or
other variables correlated with household demographic
characteristics.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
While the study didn’t get into remediation, fixing the income side of
things should be fairly straightforward, Dorsey told me. “Just making
prices lower or financing terms more comparable [to high income
households] should be fairly effective,” he said.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The sociogeographic side of things will be trickier to address. “That
might suggest a supply side policy might be effective,” Dorsey said,
“like giving installers incentives to locate in or serve communities
that are getting fewer bids and facing higher prices.”
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Policymakers and solar advocates are very aware of the
income and race disparities in solar adoptions and have come up with a
slew of policies to try and narrow them<strong>. </strong>California,
which has long been the epicenter of rooftop solar (with the most
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-18-severin-borenstein" target="_self">attendant
controversy</a> over how its incentives are designed), has a program
that
<a href="https://www.csd.ca.gov/Pages/Low-Income-Weatherization-Program.aspx" target="_blank">subsidizes
low-income households</a> that want to install solar and incentives for
affordable multifamily buildings to install solar<strong>.
</strong><strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong></strong>The
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/solar-for-all-ira" target="_self"><u>Environmental
Protection Agency’s $7 billion Solar For All</u></a> program also
supports states, tribes, and non-profits with programs to reach
low-income households. “The program will help unlock new markets for
residential solar in areas that have never seen this kind of investment
before,” an EPA spokesperson told Heatmap in an emailed statement. “Much
of the program will fund solar projects to benefit multi-family and
affordable housing, as well as community solar projects, bringing the
benefits of clean energy to households that may not have had access to
it before.”
</p>
<p>
Another favored solution for getting solar access to those who wouldn’t
otherwise have it is
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/community-solar-basics" target="_blank">community
solar</a>, where households “subscribe” to small-scale solar
installations and then get credits on their utility bill as if they had
physically installed solar in their homes.
</p>
<p>
The share of community solar capacity that serves low-to-moderate income
consumers has
<a href="https://www.woodmac.com/press-releases/2024-press-releases/us-community-solar-market-to-break-14-gwdc-of-cumulative-capacity-by-2029/" target="_blank">grown</a>
from 2% in 2022 to 12% this year, according to data from Wood Mackenzie
and the Coalition for Community Solar Access, and they project it will
continue to grow to 25% in 2025.<br/> <span></span>
</p>
<p>
The Inflation Reduction Act also includes an “adder” for community solar
projects that serve lower income consumers that boosts existing
subsidies by 10 to 20 percentage points. These community solar projects
are “already seeing impact and projects on the ground,” Molly Knoll,
vice president of policy for CCSA, told me.
</p>
<p>
EnergySage’s chief executive, Charlie Hadlow, said in a statement that
the company is “working diligently to ensure every eligible shopper gets
three to seven quotes on our platform,” and that “we welcome more
installers to sign up on our platform and are actively seeking them out,
with a deliberate focus on underserved areas.” He said consumers
typically save 20% using EnergySage compared to what they might get on
their own, and that the company also has
<a href="https://www.energysage.com/shop/community-solar/" target="_blank"><u>a
marketplace for community solar</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
All that said, Dorsey is skeptical that “installing panels at individual
rooftop” is even
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-five-rooftop-solar" target="_blank">the
best way to decarbonize</a>. “If you want to cost-effectively reduce
emissions, it’s not clear to me rooftop solar is the way to do it as
opposed to utility-scale or community solar,” he said.

gets tons of performance fixes, new FAT driver from FreeBSD, and a lot
more</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>There’s a new Haiku activity report, and it’s a big one. A lot of
bottlenecks and performance issues were addressed recently, and the list
is too long and detailed for me to cover everything. Haiku developer
Waddlesplash does a great job in this report detailing the various
things he worked on to solve some of these bottlenecks and performance
issues, and they cover everything from speeding up the readv and writev
I/O calls, fixing an issue with the kernel’s device_manager lock,
improving ELF symbol lookup by implementing the DT_GNU_HASH hash table,
and much more. As part of working on these performance issues,
Waddlesplash also fixed up Haiku’s CPU time profiler. Haiku has a
built-in CPU time profiler (just called profile.) Unfortunately, it’s
been rather broken for years, regularly outputting data that was either
empty or just didn’t make any sense. In order to use it to try and track
down some of the other bottlenecks, I spent a bunch of time fixing
various bugs in it, as well as the debugger support code that it relies
on to function, including to stack trace collection, buffer flushing,
symbol lookup, scheduler callbacks, image load reporting, and more. I
also implemented userspace-only profiling (ignoring kernel stack frames
entirely), fixed some output buffer sizing issues, and fixed a race
condition in thread resumption that also affected strace. While it isn’t
perfect, it’s much better than before, and can now be used to profile
applications and the kernel to see where CPU time is being spent; and
notably it now checks the thread’s CPU time counters to detect if it
“missed” profiling ticks, and if so how many. ↫ Haiku’s website Beyond
these performance fixes, there’s a ton of other improvements and fixes,
from better handling of HiDPI displays in HaikuDepot, improvements to
CharacterMap, fixing subtitles in MediaPlayer, and tons more. Of course,
there’s the bevy of driver fixes, including a major overhaul of the FAT
driver, which was still largely based on old, original BeOS code because
Be used the FAT driver as sample code. Haiku’s FAT driver is now based
on FreeBSD’s FAT driver, which addressed a whole slew of issues. This
isn’t even all of it – there’s so much more in this month’s activity
report, so definitely head on over and give it a read.</p>

<p>It’s been busy in the world of hobby and teaching/learning operating
systems these past few months, and today we’ve got another one – SpecOS.
SpecOS is a 64 bit operating system kernel for x86-64 processors, still
in quite early stages, written in (questionable quality) C. It is (not
very) powerful. This used to be 32 bit, but has been transferred to a 64
bit operating system. It uses a monolithic kernel, because I like having
everything in one place. This may take some inspiration from other
operating systems, but it is not UNIX based. ↫ SpecOS GitHub page It’s
got the basics covered with PS/2 keyboard and VGA support, a real-time
clock driver, a basic hard disk driver, and physical and virtual memory
management, among other things. We’re clearly looking at a hobby
project, and the author is very clear about that. A virtual machine is
highly advised, as running it on real hardware is… Well, you’re on your

American member of Congress Ilhan Omar faces repeat primary
challenge</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Minneapolis, Minnesota — Democratic U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar,
one of the progressive House members known as the “Squad” and a sharp
critic of how Israel has conducted the war in Gaza, is trying to avoid
the fate of two of her closest allies when Minnesota holds its primary
elections Tuesday.</p>
<p>Omar is defending her Minneapolis-area 5th District seat against a
repeat challenge from former Minneapolis City Council member Don
Samuels, a more centrist liberal whom she only narrowly defeated in the
2022 primary.</p>
<p>In the main statewide race on the ballot, conservative populist and
former NBA player Royce White is facing a more conventional Republican
candidate, Navy veteran Joe Fraser, for the right to challenge
Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two newcomers are in a bitter fight for the Republican
nomination to challenge Democratic Representative Angie Craig in
November in the mostly suburban 2nd District.</p>
<p>Omar’s fellow Squad member Representative Cori Bush lost the
Democratic nomination in Missouri last week. Representative Jamaal
Bowman of New York lost his primary in June. The only charter member not
facing a primary challenge is Representative Ayanna Pressley of
Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Both Bush and Bowman faced well-funded challengers and millions of
dollars in spending by the United Democracy Project, a super political
action committee affiliated with the American Israel Public Affairs
Committee, which appears to be sitting out the Minnesota race.</p>
<p>But Omar isn’t taking victory for granted. Omar reported spending
$2.3 million before the 2022 primary. In the same period this year, she
reported raising about $6.2 million. Samuels has raised about $1.4
million.</p>
<p>Omar — a Somali American and Muslim — came under fire from the
Jamaican-born Samuels and others in her first term for comments that
were widely criticized for invoking antisemitic tropes and suggesting
Jewish Americans have divided loyalties. This time, Samuels has
criticized her condemnation of the Israeli government’s handling of the
Israel-Hamas war.</p>
<p>While Omar has also criticized Hamas for attacking Israel and taking
hostages, Samuels says she’s one-sided and divisive.</p>
<p>The winner in the overwhelmingly Democratic district will face
Republican Dalia Al-Aqidi, an Iraqi American journalist and
self-described secular Muslim who calls Omar pro-Hamas and a terrorist
sympathizer.</p>
<p>In the U.S. Senate race, White — an ally of imprisoned former Donald
Trump aide Steve Bannon and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones — shocked
many political observers when he defeated Fraser at the party convention
for the Republican endorsement.</p>
<p>White’s social media comments have been denounced as misogynistic,
homophobic, antisemitic and profane. His legal and financial problems
include unpaid child support and questionable campaign spending,
including $1,200 spent at a Florida strip club after he lost his primary
challenge to Omar in 2022. He argues that, as a Black man, he can
broaden the party’s base by appealing to voters of color in the
Minneapolis-St. Paul area and others disillusioned with establishment
politics.</p>
<p>Fraser has said White’s confrontational style and message won’t
attract the moderates and independents needed for a competitive
challenge to Klobuchar, who’s seeking a fourth term. He said he offers a
more mainstream approach, stressing fiscal conservativism, a strong
defense, world leadership and small government. Fraser has also
highlighted his 26 years in the Navy, where he was an intelligence
officer and served a combat tour in Iraq.</p>
<p>Neither has anywhere near the resources that Klobuchar has. White
last reported raising $133,000, while Fraser has taken in $68,000.
Klobuchar, meanwhile, has collected about $19 million this cycle and has
more than $6 million available to spend on the general election
campaign.</p>
<p>Craig is preparing for what’s expected to be Minnesota’s most
competitive House race in November. Vying to challenge her are former
federal prosecutor Joe Teirab and defense attorney Tayler Rahm. Teirab
has the support of Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson and the National
Republican Congressional Committee. He was better funded than Rahm, who
won the endorsement at the district convention with support from
grassroots conservatives.</p>
<p>While Rahm announced in July that he was suspending his campaign and
would instead serve as a senior adviser for Trump’s Minnesota campaign,
he will still be on the ballot and didn’t fully pull the plug on his
campaign.</p>

id="serena-an-experimental-operating-system-for-32bit-amiga-computers">Serena:
an experimental operating system for 32bit Amiga computers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>Serena is an experimental operating system based on modern design
principles with support for pervasive preemptive concurrency and
multiple users. The kernel is object-oriented and designed to be
cross-platform and future proof. It runs on Amiga systems with a 68030
or better CPU installed. One aspect that sets it aside from traditional
threading-based OSs is that it is purely built around dispatch queues
somewhat similar to Apple’s Grand Central Dispatch. There is no support
for creating threads in user space nor in kernel space. Instead the
kernel implements a virtual processor concept where it dynamically
manages a pool of virtual processors. The size of the pool is
automatically adjusted based on the needs of the dispatch queues and
virtual processors are assigned to processes as needed. All kernel and
user space concurrency is achieved by creating dispatch queues and by
submitting work items to dispatch queues. Work items are simply closures
(a function with associated state) from the viewpoint of the user. ↫
Serena GitHub page Serena is a remarkably advanced concept, and since it
runs in an Amiga emulator just fine, there’s no need for real hardware,
which is becoming ever harder to come by. It has its own unique file
system, the executable file format is Atari ST GemDos (for now), and it
has its own shell. It comes with a variety of drivers and services for
your basic needs like keyboard and mouse input, a basic graphics
drivers, a VT52 and VT100 series compatible interactive console, a
floppy disk driver, and much more. Anyone can load up WinUAE and try
SerenaOS out – it’s available under the MIT license.</p>

Come on.
</p>
<p>
Still, sometimes you can see flashes of his former self, such as last
night when Trump appeared in a

with Elon Musk on Twitter, the social media platform now a year into its
own
<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90927580/elon-musk-twitter-rebrand-x-bad-idea" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rocky
rebrand</u></a> as X. Musk’s justification for the call was to give
listeners “a feel for what Donald Trump is like in a conversation” in a
non-adversarial setting (as if Trump doesn’t do
<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/04/20/biden-trump-mainstream-media-interviews" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>friendly

<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-cybertruck" target="_self"><u>all

a decent opportunity to hear Trump speak about policy without the usual
teleprompter.

<p>

Dumbest Climate Conversation of All Time</u></a>” — Trump and Musk also
touched on the problems facing the buildout of nuclear energy.
</p>
<p>
Here is the relevant part of the conversation (I’ve omitted some of the
exchange in brackets, but you can read the whole 61-page transcript
<a href="https://turboscribe.ai/transcript/share/4422534834081521519/HWE18owsC2u8E5u2HpZNikyBdermlV2YSwGlTEPKJJw/donald-trump-and-elon-musk-full-transcript-august-12-2024-https-x-com-i-spaces-1nakepnklwoxl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>

</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Trump:</strong> You know, the one thing that I don’t understand
is that people talk about global warming, or they talk about climate
change, but they never talk about nuclear warming. And for me, that’s an
immediate problem because you have, as I said, five countries where you
have major nuclear and, you know, probably some others are getting there
and that’s very dangerous. […]<br/> <br/> <strong>Musk: </strong>Yeah,
and actually, there’s the bad side of nuclear, which is a nuclear war,
very bad side. But there’s also, I think — nuclear electricity
generation is underrated. And it’s actually, you know, people have this
fear of nuclear electricity generation, but it’s actually one of the
safest forms of electricity generation. […]<br/> <br/>
<strong>Trump:</strong> Maybe they’ll have to change the name. The name
is just, it’s a rough name. There are some areas, like when you see what
happened — bad branding, the branding problem. We’ll have to rebrand it.
We’ll have to give it a good name. We’ll name it after you or something.
</blockquote>
<p>
Let’s say right off the bat, they are getting into some real stuff here.
Nuclear war is, indeed, “very bad”! To give Trump credit on the branding
front, too, “nuclear warming” is a pretty creative way of saying “a mass
detonation of atomic bombs that ends all life on Earth.” (And possibly a
clever play on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_winter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>nuclear
winter</u></a>.)
</p>
<p>
Perhaps more importantly, though, nuclear is the largest source of
carbon-free energy in the U.S. is generally considered
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/make-or-break-clean-energy#:~:text=7.-,Natrium%20Reactor,-Heatmap%20Illustration/TerraPower" target="_self"><u>crucial
to balancing out</u></a> intermittent renewables as the grid
decarbonizes and electricity demand
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/advanced-nuclear-data-centers">blows
up</a>. Talking about nuclear in a serious way will be important — which
is tricky if you buy that it has “a rough name.”
</p>
<p>
Not everybody does, of course. <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em>’s Steve Hou
<a href="https://x.com/stevehouf/status/1823301594491851144" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>disputed
Trump’s theory (on Musk’s X, no less)</u></a>, “Nuclear doesn’t have a
branding problem. It has a NIMBY problem that everyone’s ok with it in
theory as long as the nuclear plant’s in someone else’s neighborhood.”
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/08/05/majority-of-americans-support-more-nuclear-power-in-the-country/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Most
Americans</u></a> support nuclear power — more than offshore oil and gas
drilling, fracking, or coal mining. It’s the rare issue both Democrats
and Republicans
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/advance-act-nuclear" target="_self"><u>can
agree on</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
But that doesn’t mean nuclear <em><em>doesn’t </em></em>have a branding
problem. Why else would Americans
<a href="https://heatmap.news/americans-love-solar-and-want-it-on-their-roofs#:~:text=but%20ever%2Dcontroversial%20%E2%80%94-,nuclear%20power%20plant,-was%20the%20only" target="_self"><u>not
want a nuclear plant</u></a> in their backyard if not for anxiety about
radiation (or, relatedly, the Soviet unsightliness of cooling towers)?
Trump went on in his conversation with Musk to cite the 2011 Fukushima
nuclear accident in Japan and, seemingly, Chernobyl (“in Russia, where
they had a problem, where they, you know, a lot of bad things happened”)
as the reasons why Americans are, in his opinion, rightfully jittery
about nuclear energy.
</p>
<p>
Musk pushed back on Trump’s examples, asserting that nuclear energy is
“not as scary as people think” and that “Hiroshima and Nagasaki were
bombed, but now they’re, like, full cities again.” Seeing as Musk
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/08/elon-musk-donald-trump-interview-x/679450/?utm_campaign=galaxy-brain&utm_content=20240813&utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=Galaxy+Brain" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mostly
just let Trump say stuff</u></a> during their conversation, his moment
of objection is telling: Trump’s distrust of nuclear energy suggests
possible policy implications that
<a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2024/02/06/nuclear-is-fusing-republicans-and-democrats-00139822" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>people
on the right</u></a> might not like. (Trump has expressed far more
enthusiasm, however, for
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025#:~:text=It%20will%20use%20science%20to%20create%20weapons%20of%20war%20%E2%80%94%20and%20basically%20nothing%20else" target="_self"><u>building
up our nuclear arsenal</u></a>.)
</p>
<p>
Many in climate communications or the nuclear industry have thought long
and hard about how to make nuclear energy more palatable to the public,
with strategies ranging from creating
<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90951504/jones-knowles-ritchie-rebrands-nuclear-power" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>imagery
invoking the atom</u></a> (rather than the more obvious and ominous
hourglass-shaped cooling tower) to
<a href="https://www.constellationenergy.com/newsroom/2024/former-miss-america-grace-stanke-begins-career-as-nuclear-engineer-and-advocate-at-constellation.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hiring
Miss America as an industry advocate</u></a>. Last fall, John Marshall,
the CEO and founder of the Potential Energy Coalition, explained on a
podcast that his group had found the term
“<a href="https://www.nei.org/news/2023/fissionary-episode-6-john-marshall" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>new
nuclear</u></a>” tests as less intimidating to the public.
</p>
<p>
So sure, we may need something like a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/culture/reddy-kilowatt" target="_self"><u>Reddy
Kilowatt</u></a> of nuclear energy to improve messaging. That’s where
Trump’s creativity runs out, though. As Heatmap’s own polling suggests,
rebranding nuclear power as “Musk power” will
<a href="https://heatmap.news/elon-musk-is-alienating-future-tesla-buyers-heatmap-poll-finds" target="_self"><u>probably
</u><u><em><em>not</em></em></u><u> help</u></a>.

id="poland-signs-10-billion-deal-for-us-apache-attack-helicopters">Poland
signs $10 billion deal for US Apache attack helicopters</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Warsaw, POLAND — Poland on Tuesday signed a $10 billion deal to buy
96 Apache attack helicopters from U.S. manufacturer Boeing in an upgrade
to the country’s military capabilities.</p>
<p>Poland has sharply accelerated the modernization of its armed forces
since Russia’s full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine in 2022.</p>
<p>“This is the landmark purchase by Poland for its armed forces of … 96
state-of-the-art AH-64E Apache attack helicopters,” Defense Minister
Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz told reporters.</p>
<p>“Today we are taking a milestone in the transformation and equipping
of the army,” he added, speaking at the Inowroclaw air base, where the
Apaches are to be stationed.</p>
<p>The deal is the latest in a string of contracts signed by Poland with
the United States in recent days.</p>
<p>On Friday, Warsaw announced a deal to buy hundreds of AIM-120C AMRAAM
air-to-air missiles. On Monay there was a contract to build 48 launchers
for the U.S.-designed Patriot air defense systems.</p>
<p>Poland, a staunch ally of Ukraine, has announced it would spend more
than 4% of its annual economic output on defense this year — twice
NATO’s target of 2%.</p>
<p>The Ukraine war has also solidified the relationship between the
United States and Poland, a country on NATO’s eastern flank that sees
Washington as one of its main allies.</p>
<p>The Apache helicopter sale was approved last year by the U.S. State
Department and Congress.</p>
<p>The deal “changes the face of the Polish army’s operations and
complements” previous purchases, Kosiniak-Kamysz said, pointing notably
at the Abrams tanks that Poland bought in the past years.</p>
<p>According to the Polish government, the Apaches are designed to work
with the tanks.</p>
<p>“For the Abrams, the Apache is an essential element,” Kosiniak-Kamysz
said.</p>
<p>In 2022, Poland bought 250 Abrams tanks in a modern M1A2 variant,
which are expected to be delivered later this year. It will be the first
country outside the United States with the tanks.</p>
<p>The attack helicopter agreement also envisages providing the Polish
army with maintenance equipment, technical and training support, flight
simulators and spare parts.</p>
<p>“Offset, purchase, leasing, pilot training, technology, armament — it
was all negotiated together. It’s a historic day for helicopter
aviation,” Deputy Defense Minister Pawel Bejda said.</p>
<p>“These $10 billion are the insurance of our country, the insurance of
our freedom,” Bejda added, saying that the Apaches would serve the
Polish efforts to “deter those who have evil intentions.”</p>
<p>The first U.S.-made helicopters are to be delivered in 2028, but some
Polish pilots have already begun training on them.</p>
<p>The Apaches will replace outdated Russian Mi-24 helicopters.</p>

<h2 id="ezra-klein-and-nate-silver">Ezra Klein and Nate Silver</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I had another morning of driving around so I listened to a bunch of
podcasts about how the campaign is going, all good news for Democrats
which of course makes me happy. The last podcast I listened to was
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-nate-silver.html">Ezra
Klein’s interview with Nate Silver</a>. I only listened to the first 20
minutes because I ran out of time. I may pick it up later on my
afternoon walk (it’s a gorgeous day in the mountains).
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/13/trafficUptight.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">They
talked about their bond as old school bloggers. I didn’t know either of
them when they were starting out, which is kind of sad – most of the
bloggers I heard from in that period were mad at me the way they are mad
at Elon Musk now. Both Silver and Klein campaigned for Biden to step
aside, which I felt it was inappropriate – for Silver who was/is a
trusted polling analyst, and Klein who is a columnist for the NYT. I had
already listened to Klein’s interview with Nancy Pelosi. But I really
don’t like that both of them crossed a line I felt they had no business
crossing, becoming an advocate rather than a journalist. I can’t thikn
about either of them without thinking about that. But I listened anyway,
because I’m interested in both, and esp the combination.
</p>
<p>
The discussion was interesting and even agreeable until Klein asked
Silver about his relationship with Peter Thiel. I had read that Silver
was connected to Thiel in some way. Before they moved on neither
commented on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawker#Hulk_Hogan_sex_tape">Thiel’s
funding</a> of the Hulk Hogan lawsuit that destroyed Gawker. I don’t
know how they can both, for their careers, which depend on free speech,
still have a kind word for Thiel. I never liked Gawker, they made fun of
me, and others, in horrific ways, that weren’t even based on facts, the
kind of bullshit pre-teens make up about people when they can’t think of
anything else to say. Even though they hurt me, embarrassed me, aroused
my hate, even if I had the kind of money Thiel has, I never in a million
years would use that money to destroy them.
</p>
<p>
Thiel’s wealth is a weapon aimed at all our freedom. This is something
imho that has to at least be <i>mentioned</i> when a journalist talks
about Thiel, and neither of them did. I guess they feel safe from
Thiel’s attacks, perhaps because they have adjusted their writing so as
to never risk offending him, which totally undermines their integrity,
if so. A good way to prove that’s not true would be to never mention him
without saying his behavior the Hulk Hogan vs Gawker was reprehensible.
</p>
<p>
I still listened, even though they provoked my ire in a very fundamental
way. I’d be interested in hearing from them, as a fellow old school
blogger, if they justify Thiel’s funding of the Hogan lawsuit and if so,
how. But I expect that both of them consider themselves in an elite
class and wouldn’t deign to explain themselves, or the truth is
something they don’t want disclosed. Either way, to be blogger-blunt,
they both suck.
</p>
<p>
Update: I listened to more of the interview. I think these guys need to
get out more. The reason Harris is having such a strong response is that
we the voters are desperate to not have another term for Trump. We
understand the stakes in the election. You always try to reduce it to
numbers, when the facts are available at a more human level. The reason
we love Kamala is born of desperation. Stop talking to each other, you
already know why we care, because underneath it all <i>you</i> care
because you’re human and you come from America too. And btw about VCs, I
know a lot about them, I’m assuming at some point Klein will leave the
NYT to make millions with Thiel, and I imagine Silver is already doing
that, but you both have the disease. You assume great money makes people
interesting. It can make them dangerous.

<h2 id="chrome-ios-browser-on-blink">Chrome iOS browser on Blink</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>Earlier this year, under pressure from the European Union, Apple was
finally forced to open up iOS and allow alternative browser engines, at
least in the EU. Up until then, Apple only allowed its own WebKit engine
to run on iOS, meaning that even what seemed like third-party browsers –
Chrome, Firefox, and so on – were all just Safari skins, running Apple’s
WebKit underneath (with additional restrictions to make them perform
worse than Safari). Even with other browser engines now being allowed on
iOS in the EU, there’s still hurdles, as Apple requires browser makers
to maintain two different browsers, one for the EU, and another one for
the rest of the world. It seems the Chromium community is already
working on bringing the Chromium Blink browser engine to iOS, but
there’s still a lot of work to be done. A blog post by the open source
consultancy company Igalia digs into the details, since they are
contributing to the effort. While they’ve got the basics covered, it’s
far from completed or ready for release. We’ve briefly looked at the
current status of the project so far, but many functionalities still
need to be supported. For example, regarding UI features,
functionalities such as printing preview, download, text selection,
request desktop site, zoom text, translate, find in page, and touch
events are not yet implemented or are not functioning correctly.
Moreover, there are numerous failing or skipped tests in unit tests,
browser tests, and web tests. Ensuring that these tests are enabled and
passing the test should also be a key focus moving forward. ↫ Gyuyoung
Weblog I don’t use iOS, nor do I intend to any time soon, but the coming
availability of browser engines that compete with WebKit is going to be
great for the web. I’ve heard from so many web developers that Safari on
iOS is a bit of a nightmare to support, since without any competition on
iOS it often stagnates and lags behind in supporting features other
browsers already implemented. With WebKit on iOS facing competition,
that might change. Now, there’s a line of thought that all this will do
is make Chrome even more dominant, but I don’t think that’s going to be
an issue. Safari is still the default for most people, and changing
defaults is not something most people will do, especially not the
average iOS user. On top of that, this is only available in the EU, so I
honestly don’t think we have to worry about this any time soon, but
obviously, we do have to remain vigilant.</p>

Last night at the New England Godot user group I did an impromptu talk
on bringing Godot to the iPad.
</p>
<p>
One topic that I went on for a while was how the smaller screen display
had forced me to either redesign or eliminate plenty of configurable
options in Godot.
</p>
<p>
For starters, almost every Editor tunable option had been removed. I
didn’t see any reason to keep them.

<p>
Someone did point out “40 inch displays are barely enough space for me”.
Made me wonder of the sanity of the effort :-)

Heatmap polling</a> conducted in April found the top concern both
Democrats and Republicans have with renewable energy projects in their
areas is the harm those facilities could inflict on wildlife. Notably,
almost half of all Democrats said consequences for wildlife from
projects would elicit “strong concern” from them. Other big concerns for
Republicans such as reliability during extreme weather and land use
factors received nowhere near the same level of Democratic agreement.
The polling result underscores a real vulnerability that energy projects
labeled “clean” can face when a would-be host community is faced with
information indicating they may produce pollution or harm to the

There is a sliver of good news though: Last year’s estimated death toll
of 47,690 was lower than the 60,000 heat-related deaths recorded in
2022, and could have been 80% higher if it weren’t for our growing
knowledge of how to protect vulnerable populations, especially the
elderly. “We see that since 2000, the minimum mortality temperature –
the optimum temperature with the lowest mortality risk – has been
gradually warming on average over the continent, from 15ºC in 2000-2004
to 17.7ºC in 2015-2019,” said Elisa Gallo, researcher at ISGlobal and
lead author of the study. “This indicates that we are less vulnerable to
heat than we were at the beginning of the century, probably as a result
of general socio-economic progress, improvements in individual behavior,
and public health measures such as the heat prevention plans implemented
after the record-breaking summer of 2003.”

<p>
An analysis from The Economist looks at people who feel “left behind” in
America — those who got the short end of globalization and
deindustrialization, people who took the biggest hits in recent decades
from not having advanced education — and shows that that group has been
seeing economic improvement under the Trump and Biden administrations.
Plus, Harris and Trump look to nix federal taxes on tips, and consumers
expect inflation to become less of a problem.

id="millions-of-campaign-dollars-aimed-at-tilting-school-voucher-battle-are-flowing-into-state-races">Millions
of campaign dollars aimed at tilting school voucher battle are flowing
into state races</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Millions of dollars are being spent this year to
steer voters toward candidates for Republican-led Legislatures who not
only support school vouchers, but will become key figures in
implementing school choice programs in states across the U.S.</p>
<p>Most recently, national pro-voucher advocates declared victory after
spending more than $4.5 million in Tennessee’s primary election to
defend and elect legislative candidates they claim will support school
choice proposals in 2025 when state lawmakers are slated to return to
the Capitol to enact policy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at least $14.8 million was spent by similar advocacy
groups in the Texas primary election earlier in May to oust and replace
voucher opponents. In Idaho, hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent
on candidates who both opposed and supported school vouchers in the
rural mountain-west state.</p>
<p>The spending spree is backed by the nation’s most high-profile
voucher influencers, including the School Freedom Fund, a pro-voucher
group tied to Club for Growth; the American Federation for Children,
which was founded by former Trump administration Education Secretary
Betsy DeVos; and Americans for Prosperity, the Koch family’s well-heeled
free-market group.</p>
<p>Their focus is often on primary elections because in
Republican-dominated states, primaries are seen as the most competitive
hurdle to getting elected.</p>
<p>“Make no mistake — if you call yourself a Republican and oppose
school freedom, you should expect to lose your next primary,” said David
McIntosh, president of the School Freedom Fund, said in a statement
shortly after Tennessee’s primary election. “As we continue to hear from
different governors, we plan on repeating our results from Tennessee and
Texas across the country. The school freedom revolution is just
beginning.”</p>
<p>Thirty-two states have implemented some sort of voucher program in
the U.S., and some have been in place for decades, often with strict
income requirements or narrowly tailored for students with
disabilities.</p>
<p>Yet, over the years, there’s been a noticeable push among Republican
leaders to make available taxpayer-funded vouchers, or scholarships that
can follow a child regardless of income to any public or private school.
About a dozen states now have such programs. But proposals are being
considered in many more, with varying degrees of legislative
support.</p>
<p>Idaho, Tennessee and Texas all weighed sweeping school voucher
proposals over the past year, but faced resistance not only from
Democrats — who don’t hold as much political power — but also Republican
members wary of directing public education dollars away from their
districts.</p>
<p>Tennessee’s Republican Gov. Bill Lee was forced to abandon his plans
for universal school choice earlier this year after divisions inside the
GOP-controlled Statehouse failed to come to a consensus on key
specifics.</p>
<p>The failure prompted Lee to break with his previous stance of
remaining quiet during GOP primary elections and instead publicly pick
favorites this year in a handful of legislative races.</p>
<p>Additionally, outside groups like Club for Growth, American
Federation for Children, Americans for Prosperity Action, and others
poured $4.5 million across 16 House and Senate legislative races. Three
of the open primaries saw almost a million dollars spent in each of the
races.</p>
<p>Club for Growth spent the majority of the money, pouring $3.6 million
across five races and ultimately winning four of those seats.</p>
<p>Lee didn’t endorse any opponents of a sitting Republican incumbent,
but he did throw support behind candidates in four open legislative
seats — three of which were successful.</p>
<p>The modest gains for Lee’s cause came at a big political cost.</p>
<p>After Lee endorsed Sen. Jon Lundberg, this year’s voucher bill
sponsor, former President Donald Trump backed Lundberg’s opponent, Bobby
Harshbarger, son of U.S. Rep. Diane Harshbarger. After Harshbarger was
declared the winner, Trump swiped at Lee on social media, calling him a
RINO, or “Republican in Name Only” even though he endorsed Lee in his
2022 reelection.</p>
<p>Lee has so far brushed aside the criticism, and instead released a
statement declaring that Republican primary voters “sent a clear
message: It’s time to deliver school choice for Tennessee families.”</p>
<p>Focusing solely on primary voters may be a winning strategy to
securing key state level races, but it comes at a cost of electing
candidates who may not represent the average voter, said John Geer, a
political science professor at Vanderbilt University.</p>
<p>“A very small proportion of the Tennessee voting public is driving
these outcomes, that’s not good for democracy,” he said.</p>
<p>In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott also touted major wins for
voucher advocates in the aftermath of the state’s runoff primary
election in May.</p>
<p>Months prior, back in late 2023, a group of House Republicans joined
Democrats to help defeat a school voucher bill — delivering a blow to
one of Abbott’s top legislative priorities.</p>
<p>Similar to the playbook used in Tennessee, Abbott and national
voucher groups pivoted to ousting voucher opponents in the primary
election in order to secure a legislative victory in 2025.</p>
<p>Club for Growth ultimately took credit for removing 10 GOP incumbents
who had opposed Abbott’s voucher push after targeting 14 races in
primary and runoff election. Club for Growth reported spending $8.8
million and Abbott spent at least $6 million between the primary and
runoff elections.</p>
<p>“The Texas legislature now has enough votes to pass school choice,”
Abbott posted after the runoff election.</p>
<p>And in Idaho, four anti-school voucher Republican incumbents lost
their reelection bids after the American for Children PAC spent more
than $300,000 to promote school choice candidates.</p>
<p>During the 2022 election cycle, the organization spent $9 million on
state legislative races to support school choice friendly candidates but
CEO Tommy Schultz promised to spend “at least $10 million” this
year.</p>
<p>“To date, AFC and its affiliates have deployed more than $9 million
in state legislative primary elections across the country, and we will
spend millions more in the general election to advance school choice
policies for American families,” Schultz said in a statement to AP.</p>

<h2 id="indieweb-carnival-rituals">IndieWeb Carnival: Rituals</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Ritual, &lt;em&gt;a sequence of activities involving gestures, words, actions, or revered objects.&lt;/em&gt; Nothing in my life fits that definition.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
That’s it, that was my entry for this month’s IndieWeb Carnival on the
topic of Rituals. See you next month!
</p>
<p>
I’m just kidding. Well, I’m partly kidding. I’m serious when I say that
I don’t have anything that fits that definition in my life. I’d love to,
but I don’t. I’ve always been fascinated by rituals and strict routines.
And believe me when I say that I tried to implement them in my life many
many times before but always failed. I tried it with my meditation
routine, with my reading habits, and with my sleeping schedule. Nothing
sticks and introducing a ritual so far has been close to impossible. I
don’t know why. I’m just bad at living a structured life even though I’d
love to. But I think that’s mostly because I’m not really happy with the
life I’m currently living and settling into a routine is hard when you
know, deep down, that you want to change everything.
</p>
<p>
That said, rituals are awesome. There’s something deeply enjoyable in
seeing someone performing something in a very ritualistic way. Which is
why I always enjoyed things like the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_tea_ceremony">Japanese
tea ceremony</a>. This idea of doing something the same way over and
over again is very appealing to me. And who knows, maybe one day I’ll
manage to do the same myself.

<h1 id="2024-08-11-serving-bare-git-on-the-web">
2024-08-11 Serving bare git on the web
</h1>
<p>
In the old days, I used <code>cgit</code> to render my git repositories
on the web. It’s simple to set up since it’s a CGI script. This is ideal
for URLs that get very few hits. When nobody is requesting the URL, the
CGI script isn’t running and no resources are being used. When a URL is
requested, however, the CGI script loads, the interpreter loads, the
libraries load, the script executes… It’s an expensive end-point! And
you know how it is. The web is full of leeches and bad bots, crawlers
and idiots. Having an expensive end-point means it needs protection.
</p>
<p>
For I while I thought that <code>legit</code> was the answer. It was
nice and fast and all that. But recently, <code>git clone</code> no
longer worked. It calls <code>git upload-pack</code> as an intermediate
workaround for
<a href="https://github.com/go-git/go-git/issues/1062">#1062</a>. This
was failing for some reason, however. I tinkered with it for a while but
didn’t get anywhere.
</p>
<p>
Then I started thinking about
<a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Sandra">@Sandra</span></a>’s post on
<a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/hosting-git-repos">hosting git
repos</a>. I made some changes to my Apache config and now <code>git
clone</code> works again.
</p>
<p>
The key is that you need a <code>post-update</code> hook that calls
<code>git update-server-info</code>. Each git repository already comes
with a <code>post-update.sample</code> hook containing the necessary
code, so I needed to loop over all the bare repositories I had and
rename the example hook.
</p>
<p>
Using the Fish shell:
</p>
<pre><code>for d in *.git
    sudo -u git mv $d/hooks/post-update.sample $d/hooks/post-update
end
</code></pre>
<p>
Sadly, this is not good enough.
</p>
<p>
In order to generate an <code>index.html</code> file for every
repository, I need a hook that regenerates it. If you know how to
determine whether regeneration can be skipped, I’d love to hear how to
that.
</p>
<p>
This hook also updates or adds the <code>AddDescription</code> lines I
need.
</p>
<p>
I prepared a hook that I wanted to install in every repository and saved
it as <code>~/post-update</code>.
</p>
<p>
This is what it looks like, using the Fish shell:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish

git update-server-info

# create index.html
set branch (git branch --show-current)
set template (cat /home/git/.readme.html | string collect)
set title (basename (pwd))
set body (git show $branch:README.md | cmark --to html | string collect)
printf &quot;$template&quot; &quot;$title&quot; &quot;$body&quot; &quot;$title&quot; &gt; index.html

# update description
set description (cat description)
sed --in-place=~ --expression &quot;/ $title/d&quot; /home/git/.htaccess
printf &quot;AddDescription \&quot;$description\&quot; $title\n&quot; &gt;&gt; /home/git/.htaccess
</code></pre>
<p>
(I need the title twice, once for the title and once for the reminder on
how to clone.)
</p>
<p>
I turn Markdown into HTML using <code>cmark</code>. Common Mark is the
closest we have to a standard, I guess.
</p>
<p>
The template <code>/home/git/.readme.html</code> looks like this:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;format-detection&quot; content=&quot;telephone=no&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;%s&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
html { max-width: 70ch; padding: 1ch; margin: auto; }
body { hyphens: auto; }
    &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;nav&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://src.alexschroeder.ch/&quot;&gt;Source code repositories&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/nav&gt;
    &lt;main&gt;
%s&lt;/main&gt;
    &lt;footer&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Clone&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;pre&gt;
&lt;mark&gt;git clone https://src.alexschroeder.ch/%s&lt;/mark&gt;
      &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/footer&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
So now I needed to distribute the <code>post-update</code> hook to every
repository and run it once. I wrote yet another Fish script,
<code>~/recreate-index</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
for d in /home/git/*.git
    echo $d
    cd $d
    cp ~/post-update hooks/
    chown git:git hooks/post-update
    chmod 775 hooks/post-update
    sudo -u git git hook run post-update
end
</code></pre>
<p>
I’m currently hosting 95 repositories according to <code>ls -d
/home/git/*.git | wc -l</code>. Some of these don’t have a
<code>README.md</code> file. Should I ever touch them again, I’ll have
to investigate.
</p>
<p>
Now, for the Apache web server – I changed my site to the following:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:443&gt;
    ServerAdmin alex@alexschroeder.ch
    ServerName src.alexschroeder.ch
    Include conf-enabled/blocklist.conf
    SSLEngine on
    DocumentRoot /home/git
   &lt;Directory /home/git&gt;
        Options Indexes
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
The <code>/home/git</code> directory has an <code>.htaccess</code> file
that starts out containing the following:
</p>
<pre><code>HeaderName .top.html
IndexOptions SuppressIcon SuppressSize FancyIndexing HTMLTable IgnoreCase
IndexOrderDefault Descending Date
IndexHeadInsert &quot;&lt;meta name=\&quot;viewport\&quot; content=\&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1\&quot;&gt;&quot;
IndexOptions Charset=UTF-8
</code></pre>
<p>
The <code>.top.html</code> file contains a fragment to add to the top of
the index:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
body { max-width: 80ch }
table { overflow-x: auto }
td { padding: 0.5ex 1em 0 0; white-space: nowrap }
td:nth-child(3) { white-space: wrap }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Source code repositories&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Hello!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I'm Alex Schroeder.
  These are my source code repositories. You can find out more about me on
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexschroeder.ch/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;. There, you'll also find a page
  listing ways to &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexschroeder.ch/view/Contact&quot;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As for the git repositories, you should be able to clone them as they are.
  For example:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
  git clone https://src.alexschroeder.ch/oddmu.git
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

<strong>2024-08-12</strong>. I wondered about links from the README to
local files. Right now, linking to images and files hosted in the same
repository doesn’t work since they don’t exist in the raw repository.
The question then becomes, as far as I am concerned, whether this README
is supposed to speak to developers or end-users? If it is for
developers, then pictures, screenshots, PDF files and all of that don’t
need to be linked from the repository. If you are interested in these
things, do a <code>git clone –depth 1</code> and investigate locally.
</p>
<p>
If the repository is for the end users, however, things are harder. The
<code>post-update</code> hook should extract all the local files linked
to from the README. Something like the following, perhaps:
</p>
<pre><code>for file in (printf &quot;%s\n&quot; $body | /home/oddmu/oddmu links - | egrep -v '^(https?:|mailto:|/)')
    set dir (dirname $file)
    if test ! -d $dir
        mkdir -p $dir
    end
    echo $file; sudo -u git git show $branch:$file &gt; $file
end
</code></pre>
<p>
This uses <a href="oddmu">oddmu</a> to extract the links from a Markdown
file, creates the necessary directories and checks out the files.
</p>
<p>
But if the files are no longer linked from the README, they are not
deleted. If a directory is linked from the README (I have done this!
🤦), the checkout won’t work.
</p>
<p>
I think the better way forward is to move this information elsewhere.
The README is not the documentation.
</p>
<p>
And with that, I think I did it! Serving git repositories from static
files. A single directory per project containing the bare git data and a
single <code>index.html</code> file. No more gazillion end points for
crawlers to lose themselves.

<h2 id="elon-musk-interview-of-trump-marred-by-technical-issues">Elon
Musk interview of Trump marred by technical issues</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s
interview with billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk finally got underway
on Musk’s social media platform X on Monday evening, following a lengthy
delay caused by technical problems that kept many users from accessing
the live stream.</p>
<p>Musk, who has endorsed Trump, began the event at 8:42 p.m., more than
40 minutes after the scheduled start time. He blamed the difficulties on
a distributed denial-of-service attack, in which a server or network is
flooded with traffic in an attempt to shut it down, though his claim was
not confirmed.</p>
<p>More than 1.3 million people were listening about 45 minutes into the
conversation, according to a counter on X.</p>
<p>Trump sought to turn the problems into a positive, congratulating
Musk on the number of people trying to tune in.</p>
<p>The former president sounded at times as if he had a lisp, many
listeners on X pointed out. Some said it made him sound like a cartoon
character, others suggested it could be due to audio compression
issues.</p>
<p>The technical issues recalled a similar event on X in May 2023, when
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suffered a chaotic start to his bid for
the Republican presidential nomination due to glitches on the
platform.</p>
<p>At the time, Trump mocked DeSantis on his own, social media platform,
Truth Social. “My Red Button is bigger, better, stronger, and is working
(TRUTH!)” Trump posted, “Yours does not.”</p>
<p>Ahead of Monday’s event, Musk had written: “Am going to do some
system scaling tests tonight &amp; tomorrow in advance of the
conversation.” X did not respond to requests for details or evidence of
the alleged cyberattack.</p>
<p>Musk spent much of the early part of the interview lauding Trump for
his bravery during the attempt on his life on July 13, when his ear was
struck by a bullet.</p>
<p>Musk, the world’s richest person, announced his support for Trump
shortly after the shooting. He backed Democratic President Joe Biden in
2020 but has tacked rightward since.</p>
<p>Trump said he plans to return to Butler, Pennsylvania, the site of
the attack, for a rally in October.</p>
<p>As the conversation unfolded, Trump delivered his usual mix of
grievances, exaggerated claims and personal attacks, with Musk offering
occasional encouragement.</p>
<p>Trump claimed without evidence that Russia would not have invaded
Ukraine if he were still president and praised Russian President
Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim
Jong Un — all authoritarian strongmen — as at the “top of their
game.”</p>
<p>He also expressed anger that Vice President Kamala Harris had been
swapped in for Biden on the Democratic ticket.</p>
<p>“She hasn’t done an interview since this whole scam started,” Trump
said, claiming falsely that Biden dropping off the ticket was a “coup.”
Trump had been leading Biden in many polls of battleground states likely
to be critical to the outcome of the Nov. 5 election but is now trailing
Harris in some of the same states.</p>
<p>In an interview that was light on policy detail, Trump also appeared
to praise Musk for firing workers.</p>
<p>“You’re the greatest cutter. I mean, I look at what you do. You walk
in, you just say: ‘You want to quit?’ They go on strike — I won’t
mention the name of the company — but they go on strike. And you say:
‘That’s OK, you’re all gone.’”</p>
<p>Trump back on X</p>
<p>The interview provided an opportunity for Trump to seize the
limelight at a time when his campaign is facing new headwinds.</p>
<p>Harris has erased Trump’s lead in opinion polls and energized
Democratic voters with a series of high-energy rallies since she
replaced Biden as the party’s candidate three weeks ago. Her momentum
could get another boost from the Democratic National Convention next
week in Chicago.</p>
<p>Trump returned to X, formerly known as Twitter, with a series of
posts on Monday for the first time in a year, reviving an account that
had served as a main method of communication in previous campaigns and
his four years in the White House, including his followers’ Jan. 6,
2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>Trump’s access to his account, <span class="citation"
data-cites="realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</span>, was restored a
month into Musk’s ownership of X after being suspended by the platform’s
previous owners following the Jan. 6 attack, citing concerns he would
incite violence.</p>
<p>Trump frequently posts on his Truth Social platform, which was
launched in February 2022, but his posts there reach a much smaller
audience than on X.</p>
<p>Musk backs Trump</p>
<p>Musk, who heads electric car company Tesla, has echoed Trump’s false
claims about voter fraud and Biden’s immigration policies.</p>
<p>Musk has started an external super PAC spending group to support
Trump’s campaign. The political action committee is now under
investigation in Michigan for possible violations of state laws on
gathering voter information.</p>
<p>Trump, a longstanding critic of electric vehicles, shifted gears
after Musk’s endorsement.</p>
<p>“I’m for electric cars. I have to be, because Elon endorsed me very
strongly. So I have no choice,” Trump said at an early August rally.</p>
<p>United Auto Workers President Shawn Fein, campaigning in support of
Harris, called Trump a “sellout.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration has worked to popularize electric vehicles
through tax breaks and other support as part of its broader goal of
reducing carbon emissions blamed for climate change.</p>
<p>Republicans in Congress, including Trump’s running mate Senator JD
Vance, have opposed those subsidies.</p>

id="judge-rules-rfk-jr.-not-a-state-resident-cant-be-on-new-york-ballot">Judge
rules RFK Jr. not a state resident, can’t be on New York ballot</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ALBANY, N.Y. — A judge ruled Monday that independent presidential
candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s name should not appear on New York’s
ballot, saying that he falsely claimed a New York residence on
nominating petitions despite living in California.</p>
<p>Kennedy’s lawyers quickly vowed to appeal ahead of the Aug. 15
deadline. If the judge’s ruling is upheld, it would not only keep
Kennedy off the ballot in New York but could also lead to challenges in
other states where he used an address in New York City’s suburbs to
gather signatures.</p>
<p>The ruling came after a North Carolina judge decided earlier Monday
that Kennedy can remain on that state’s ballot following a separate
challenge on different grounds.</p>
<p>Judge Christina Ryba, in her 34-page decision, said the rented
bedroom Kennedy claimed as his home in the state wasn’t a “bona fide and
legitimate residence, but merely a ‘sham’ address that he assumed for
the purpose of maintaining his voter registration” and furthering his
political candidacy.</p>
<p>“Given the size and appearance of the spare bedroom as shown in the
photographs admitted into evidence, the Court finds Kennedy’s testimony
that he may return to that bedroom to reside with his wife, family
members, multiple pets, and all of his personal belongings to be highly
improbable, if not preposterous,” the judge wrote.</p>
<p>Ryba said evidence submitted in trial showed Kennedy had a
“long-standing pattern” of borrowing addresses from friends and
relatives so he could maintain his voter registration in New York State
while actually residing in California.</p>
<p>“Using a friend’s address for political and voting purposes, while
barely stepping foot on the premises, does not equate to residency under
the Election Law,” the judge wrote. “To hold otherwise would establish a
dangerous precedent and open the door to the fraud and political
mischief that the Election Law residency rules were designed to
prevent.”</p>
<p>Clear Choice Action, the Democrat-aligned political action committee
that backed the legal challenge, said the ruling makes it clear that
Kennedy “lied about his residency and provided a false address on his
filing papers and candidate petitions in New York, intentionally
misleading election officials and betraying voters’ trust.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed on behalf of several voters in the state, claims
Kennedy’s state nominating petition falsely listed a residence in
well-to-do Katonah while actually living in the Los Angeles area since
2014, when he married “Curb Your Enthusiasm” actor Cheryl Hines.</p>
<p>Kennedy, who led a New York-based environmental group for decades and
whose namesake father was a New York senator, argued during the trial
that he has lifelong ties to New York and intends to move back.</p>
<p>During the trial, which ran for less than four days, Kennedy said he
currently rents a room in a friend’s home in Katonah, about 65
kilometers north of midtown Manhattan, though has only slept in that
room once due to his constant campaign travel.</p>
<p>The 70-year-old candidate testified that his move to California a
decade ago was so he could be with his wife, and that he always planned
to return to New York.</p>
<p>Barbara Moss, who rents the room to Kennedy, testified that he pays
her $500 a month. But she acknowledged there is no written lease and
that Kennedy’s first payment wasn’t made until after the New York Post
published a story casting doubt on Kennedy’s claim that he lived at that
address.</p>
<p>The judge also heard from a longtime friend of Kennedy’s who said the
candidate had regularly been an overnight guest at his own Westchester
home from 2014 through 2017, but was not a tenant there as Kennedy had
claimed.</p>
<p>Attorneys representing several New York voters grilled Kennedy in
often heated exchanges as they sought to make their case, pointing to
government documents including a federal statement of candidacy with a
California address, and even a social media video in which Kennedy talks
about training ravens at his Los Angeles home.</p>
<p>“Kennedy’s testimony that none of the furniture, bedding and other
decorative items in the spare bedroom belonged to him, as well as his
testimony that his wife and family, his extensive book collection, and
his wide assortment of domestic and exotic pets all remained in
California, was further compelling evidence that Kennedy lacks the
necessary physical presence and intent to remain” at the Katonah
address, the judge wrote in her ruling.</p>
<p>Kennedy has the potential to do better than any independent
presidential candidate in decades thanks to his famous name and a loyal
base. Both Democrat and Republican strategists have expressed concerns
that he could affect their candidate’s chances.</p>
<p>Kennedy’s campaign has said he has enough signatures to qualify in a
majority of states, but his ballot drive has faced challenges and
lawsuits in several.</p>
<p>Kennedy has told reporters that getting knocked off the ballot in New
York could lead to lawsuits in other states where his campaign listed
the same address.</p>
<p>After the trial ended Thursday, Kennedy argued that people who signed
his petitions deserve a chance to vote for him.</p>
<p>“Those Americans want to see me on the ballot. They want to have a
choice,” he said.</p>

investigating after Trump campaign says it was hacked by Iran</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. FBI said on Monday it was investigating after
Donald Trump’s presidential campaign said its internal communications
were hacked and the campaign blamed the Iranian government.</p>
<p>The former president said on Saturday that Microsoft had informed his
campaign that Iran had hacked one of its websites. Trump said Iran was
“only able to get publicly available information.”</p>
<p>The FBI is also investigating an alleged hack targeting advisers to
the campaign of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris,
The Washington Post reported on Monday.</p>
<p>The FBI began the investigation in June, when Biden was still running
for president, suspecting that Iran was behind the attempts to steal
data from two U.S. presidential campaigns, the newspaper said, citing
sources.</p>
<p>The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for
comment. Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee after Biden
withdrew his bid last month.</p>
<p>The Iranian government has denied that it hacked the Trump
campaign.</p>
<p>Trump’s campaign has pointed to a report on Friday by Microsoft
researchers that indicated that Iranian government-linked hackers tried
breaking into the account of a “high-ranking official” on a U.S.
presidential campaign in June.</p>
<p>The report added that the hackers took over an account belonging to a
former political adviser and then used it to target the official. It did
not provide further details on the targets’ identities.</p>
