it plan to defrost? Plus, the secret to using AI well at work may

id="west-eyes-new-measures-after-passage-of-hong-kong-security-law">West
Eyes New Measures After Passage of Hong Kong Security Law</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Taipei, Taiwan — Hong Kong’s adoption of a second national security
law Tuesday is being criticized by foreign governments, while some
business figures say the law will hasten foreign businesses’ departure
from the city.</p>
<p>The United Nations, the United States, the United Kingdom and the
European Union expressed concern about the ambiguous language in the law
and its speedy adoption, which was completed in less than two weeks.</p>
<p>U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk warned that the
vague provisions in the bill, also known as Article 23, could lead to
the criminalization of freedom of expression, freedom of peaceful
assembly and the right to receive and impart information, which are all
rights protected under international human rights law.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department said passage of Article 23 could
accelerate the closing of a once-open society, adding that the U.S. is
analyzing the potential impact of the law.</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the law has failed to
“provide certainty for international organizations, including diplomatic
missions” operating in Hong Kong, and it will foster “the culture of
self-censorship” that is now dominating the social and political
landscape in the city.</p>
<p>Apart from reiterating concerns about the law’s potential impact on
Hong Kong people’s basic rights and freedom, the EU said the bill’s
increased penalties, extraterritorial reach and partial retroactive
applicability are “also deeply worrying.”</p>
<p>Despite the international criticism, Hong Kong Chief Executive John
Lee hailed the passage of Article 23 as “a historic moment for Hong
Kong,” while the Chinese government expressed “full support” of the
development.</p>
<p>Rights activists call for sanctions</p>
<p>While they welcome the concerns expressed by foreign governments,
some human rights activists urged democratic countries to respond with
more forceful measures.</p>
<p>“With the enactment of the Article 23 legislation, now is the time to
impose sanctions on officials like Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee,”
said Benedict Rogers, the CEO of U.K.-based nongovernmental organization
Hong Kong Watch.</p>
<p>Since Hong Kong implemented the controversial national security law
and detained dozens of pro-democracy activists and politicians in 2020,
the U.S. is the only country that has imposed sanctions on Hong Kong and
Chinese officials, 24 of them in all.</p>
<p>Rogers said since the U.K. doesn’t want to damage trade relations
with China, the British government remains reluctant to impose sanctions
on Chinese officials over the deteriorating conditions in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>“[While] they imposed sanctions on some Chinese officials over the
human rights violations in Xinjiang, they haven’t done anything similar
on Hong Kong,” he told VOA by phone.</p>
<p>While the U.S. has introduced some tools to counter China’s
tightening control over Hong Kong — including sanctions, new legislation
to ban the export of certain items to Hong Kong and the elimination of
Hong Kong’s special status — some observers urged Washington to roll out
more forceful measures following the passage of the Article 23.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot that Congress and the administration can do, including
issuing additional sanctions against people responsible for the
implementation of the two national security laws and advancing other
existing legislations related to Hong Kong,” Samuel Bickett, a
Washington-based human rights activist, told VOA by phone.</p>
<p>In a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken Thursday,
leaders of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China and the House
Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party urged him to consider
imposing new sanctions against officials responsible for undermining
freedom and rule of law in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>They also vowed to advance the Hong Kong Economic Trade Office
Certification Act and the Transnational Repression Policy Act through
Congress. Once passed, the two bills would require Hong Kong to shut
down its trade offices in the U.S. and allow the U.S. government to
impose sanctions against Chinese or Hong Kong officials responsible for
launching transnational repression against dissidents in the U.S. </p>
<p>Laws’ effect on immigration, business</p>
<p>Apart from adopting more forceful measures against the Hong Kong and
Chinese governments, Bickett and Rogers think democratic countries
should introduce new immigration measures to accommodate the growing
number of Hong Kong citizens leaving the city. According to statistics
from Bloomberg, around 500,000 people have left Hong Kong since
2021.</p>
<p>While the U.K. has introduced an immigration program for holders of
British Overseas Passports from Hong Kong, which was recently extended
to more young people, Rogers hopes other countries, including the U.S.
and those in Europe, can create similar programs tailored for Hong
Kongers.</p>
<p>“I would like to see the EU and the U.S. offer some options so Hong
Kongers who don’t qualify for the U.K.’s immigration scheme can have
alternative options,” he said.</p>
<p>Since the Article 23 legislation uses vague language to define
espionage and theft of state secrets, some analysts say foreign
businesses may face serious challenges when conducting due diligence
investigations or seeking information.</p>
<p>“This could be a big blow to banks and financial institutions, and it
will further discourage investors from coming to Hong Kong since access
to information is now further restricted,” Eric Lai, an expert on Hong
Kong’s legal system at Georgetown Center for Asian Law, told VOA by
phone.</p>
<p>Some analysts say the growing uncertainty in the business environment
would lead more foreign businesses to consider leaving Hong Kong.</p>
<p>“Article 23 will hasten the departure of international businesses
unless the Hong Kong government quickly establishes guard rails
constricting the operational boundaries of the new law,” Andrew Collier,
managing director of Orient Capital Research, told VOA in a written
response.</p>

id="biden-to-tout-government-investing-8.5-billion-in-intels-computer-chip-plants-in-four-states">Biden
to Tout Government Investing $8.5 Billion in Intel’s Computer Chip
Plants in Four States</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The Biden administration has reached an agreement to
provide Intel with up to $8.5 billion in direct funding and $11 billion
in loans for computer chip plants in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and
Oregon. </p>
<p>President Joe Biden plans to talk up the investment on Wednesday as
he visits Intel’s campus in Chandler, Arizona, which could be a decisive
swing state in November’s election. He has often said that not enough
voters know about his economic policies and suggested that more would
support him if they did know. </p>
<p>Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the deal reached through her
department would put the United States in a position to produce 20% of
the world’s most advanced chips by 2030, up from the current level of
zero. The United States designs advanced chips, but its inability to
make them domestically has emerged as a national security and economic
risk. </p>
<p>“Failure is not an option — leading-edge chips are the core of our
innovation system, especially when it comes to advances in artificial
intelligence and our military systems,” Raimondo said on a call with
reporters. “We can’t just design chips. We have to make them in
America.”</p>
<p>The funding announcement comes amid the heat of the 2024 presidential
campaign. Biden has been telling voters that his policies have led to a
resurgence in U.S. manufacturing and job growth. His message is a direct
challenge to former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican
nominee, who raised tariffs while in the White House and wants to do so
again on the promise of protecting U.S. factory jobs from China. </p>
<p>Biden narrowly beat Trump in Arizona in 2020 by a margin of 49.4% to
49.1%. </p>
<p>U.S. adults have dim views of Biden’s economic leadership, with just
34% approving, according to a February poll by The Associated Press-NORC
Center for Public Affairs. The lingering impact of inflation hitting a
four-decade high in 2022 has hurt the Democrat, who had a 52% approval
on the economy in July 2021. </p>
<p>Intel’s projects would be funded in part through the bipartisan 2022
CHIPS and Science Act, which the Biden administration helped shepherd
through Congress at a time of concerns after the pandemic that the loss
of access to chips made in Asia could plunge the U.S. economy into
recession.  </p>
<p>When pushing for the investment, lawmakers expressed concern about
efforts by China to control Taiwan, which accounts for more than 90% of
advanced computer chip production. </p>
<p>Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat up for reelection this year,
stressed that his state would become “a global leader in semiconductor
manufacturing” as Intel would be generating thousands of jobs. Ohio has
voted for Trump in the past two presidential elections, and Brown in
November will face Republican Bernie Moreno, a Trump-backed businessman
from Cleveland. </p>
<p>Wednesday’s announcement is the fourth and largest so far under the
chips law, with the government support expected to help enable Intel to
make $100 billion in capital investments over five years. About 25% of
that total would involve building and land, while roughly 70% would go
to equipment, said Pat Gelsinger, CEO of Intel. </p>
<p>“We think of this as a defining moment for the United States, the
semiconductor industry and for Intel,” said Gelsinger, who called the
CHIPS Act “the most critical industrial policy legislation since World
War II.” </p>
<p>The Intel CEO said on a call with reporters that he would like to see
a sequel to the 2022 law in order to provide additional funding for the
industry. </p>
<p>Biden administration officials say that computer chip companies would
not be investing domestically at their expected scale without the
government support. Intel funding would lead to a combined 30,000
manufacturing and construction jobs. The company also plans to claim tax
credits from the Treasury Department worth up to 25% on qualified
investments. </p>
<p>The Santa Clara, California-based company will use the funding in
four different states. In Chandler, Arizona, the money will help to
build two new chip plants and modernize an existing one. The funding
will establish two advanced plants in New Albany, Ohio, which is just
outside the state capital of Columbus. </p>
<p>The company will also turn two of its plants in Rio Rancho, New
Mexico into advanced packaging facilities. And Intel will also modernize
facilities in Hillsboro, Oregon. </p>
<p>The Biden administration has also made workforce training and access
to affordable childcare a priority in agreements to support companies.
Under the agreement with the Commerce Department, Intel will commit to
local training programs as well as increase the reimbursement amount for
its childcare program, among other efforts.</p>

Today, we’re bringing you a very ESG-focused podcast. First, Texas is
pulling $8.5 billion from the country’s biggest asset manager,
BlackRock, which the state’s school fund says is hostile to the fossil
fuel industry. It’s a pushback against ESG investing, in which
environmental, social and corporate governance issues factor into
decision-making. Then, a new paper says climate resilience is an
investment opportunity for big-time institutional investors. We delve
in.

Automatic Toll Booths by Obscuring License Plates</h2>

on a variety of techniques drivers are using to obscure their license
plates so that automatic readers can’t identify them and charge tolls
properly.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Some drivers have power-washed paint off their plates or covered them
with a range of household items such as leaf-shaped magnets,
Bramwell-Stewart said. The Port Authority says officers in 2023 roughly
doubled the number of summonses issued for obstructed, missing or
fictitious license plates compared with the prior year.
</p>
<p>
Bramwell-Stewart said one driver from New Jersey repeatedly used what’s
known in the streets as a flipper, which lets you remotely swap out a
car’s real plate for a bogus one ahead of a toll area. In this instance,
the bogus plate corresponded to an actual one registered to a woman who
was mystified to receive the tolls. “Why do you keep billing me?”
Bramwell-Stewart recalled her asking…

its new SUV, the R2 — a $45,000 family hauler that will get more than
300 miles in range. It also debuted the R3 and R3X hatchbacks, which
entranced online car nerds.

These new Rivian models are sleek and important, but they won’t go on

In this week’s episode, Rob and Jesse discuss Rivian’s quest to survive,
how electrification is creating new vehicle categories, and the coolest

that things in the sea tend to evolve into crabs. There’s lots of
animals that look like crabs in the sea that are not true crabs, so to
speak, because the crab is like a very successful bottom dweller form
factor. And so animals that do not start as crabs, once they fill the
same ecological niche as crabs, will wind up looking like crabs after
you know 10 million, 15 million years.<br/><br/> To remember another
guy, I have been thinking also a lot of the — again, if you’re not
driving, Google this — the 1990s Toyota Previa, which was a kind of, it
was a minivan that was like a half oval. It was kind of pill shaped. And
again, the wheels were right at the front and right at the back. It was
a more successful car, you’ll see it, it was the iconic 90s Toyota
minivan. <br/> <br/> And I do feel like, to some degree, the whole car
market is undergoing this process of carcinization, where what is
actually the vehicle that people want the most, especially families want
the most, is a minivan. But minivans are not seen as cool or rugged, and
so the whole car market is like trying to generate a vehicle that is as
close to the Previa as possible but does not look like a mini— You know,
it’s not actually, but to some degree I feel like we keep evolving
minivans again and again. <br/> <br/> If you think about the history of
what the family car has been, where it was a station wagon in the 70s
and 80s, then it was a minivan. Now it’s this crossover SUV thing. <br/>
<br/> <strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah, because they make a lot of
sense.<br/> <br/> <strong>Meyer: </strong>Those are, broadly, very
similar cars. They’re very similar, right? They let you seat two to
three kids and they give you a lot of space in the back. But as fashion
changes and what’s cool, we have to keep redesigning that form factor
for just what’s trendy at the moment. But we’re just dancing around this
common design.<br/> <br/> <strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah, it’s really
interesting. There’s such a funny love hate relationship out there with
minivans. I mean, they are incredibly useful cars, right? But it’s so
hard culturally. It’s so hard to be like, <em>Oh, I got a minivan, I
gotta drive a minivan now</em>. I turned 40 this year, so I’m right
there. I grew up—<br/> <br/> <strong>Meyer: </strong>You’re closer to
your midlife crisis than I am here.<br/> <br/> <strong>Jenkins:</strong>
—in a household with, originally, when I was first born, they had two
Volkswagen bugs. And then as we, my sister and I grew up and we needed
more space, both my parents traded in their bugs for Volkswagen
minibuses. So we had the Volkswagen bus. And it was like the best family
car growing up, right? Because we could all camp in it. Like, you know,
we could throw the back seat down and put a mattress there. One of us
could sleep on the floor, the middle seats. All my friends would fit
inside it for trips to the beach. You know, it was just a super useful
vehicle. <br/> <br/> And of course that, you know, that sort of design
atrophied out in terms of the mass market. People still buy them to
convert for campers and things like that, like the Volkswagen California
and other kinds of models like that in the van segment. But it’s
interesting, the ID.4 Buzz is coming back to the market in the U.S. this
year, as well. It’s the sort of rebirth of theVolkswagen microbus, and
I’m really curious to see how it does because it’s a cool design. It’s a
very retro forward, right? Which is very similar to how the R3 looks,
I’d say. <br/> <br/> I’ll come back to that in a minute. But I’m really
curious to see how it sells. I know my family’s been really interested
in it, waiting for it to come out and see what it actually looks like in
real life, and maybe test drive it and see if it’s something we might
want in the future. But I would love to see more in that category,
right? The van.<br/> <br/> And you know, the SUV is really just trying
to imitate a van with rugged looks that you really don’t need. If you
just admit it, you just want a minivan.<span></span>

weaknesses former president Trump is bringing to the 2024 presidential
contest. Trump, who is the only person still in the Republican race, won
all five of today’s Republican races. But the results showed that his
support is soft. Results are still coming in, but as I write this,
former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, who has suspended her

DeSantis—who has also suspended his campaign—picked up votes, and “none

<h2 id="how-texas-plans-to-arrest-migrants-would-work">How Texas’ Plans
to Arrest Migrants Would Work</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>McALLEN, Texas — A law that would allow Texas law enforcement to
arrest migrants suspected of illegally entering the U.S. is back on
hold.</p>
<p>The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals late Tuesday issued an order
preventing its enforcement, just hours after the Supreme Court allowed
the strict new immigration law to take effect.</p>
<p>The Justice Department is challenging the law, saying Texas is
overstepping the federal government’s immigration authority. Texas
argues it has a right to take action over what the governor has
described as an “invasion” of migrants on the border.</p>
<p>Here’s what to know:</p>
<p>Who can be arrested? </p>
<p>The law would allow any Texas law enforcement officer to arrest
people suspected of entering the country illegally. Once in custody,
migrants could either agree to a Texas judge’s order to leave the U.S.
or be prosecuted on misdemeanor charges of illegal entry. Migrants who
don’t leave could face arrest again under more serious felony
charges.</p>
<p>Arresting officers must have probable cause, which could include
witnessing the illegal entry or seeing it on video. </p>
<p>The law cannot be enforced against people lawfully present in the
U.S., including those who were granted asylum or who are enrolled in the
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.</p>
<p>Critics, including Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, fear
the law could lead to racial profiling and family separation.</p>
<p>American Civil Liberties Union affiliates in Texas and some
neighboring states issued a travel advisory a day after Gov. Greg Abbott
signed the law. The advisory warns of a possible threat to civil and
constitutional rights when passing through Texas. </p>
<p>Abbott has rejected concerns over profiling. While signing the bill,
he said troopers and National Guard members at the border can see
migrants crossing illegally “with their own eyes.”</p>
<p>Where would the law be enforced? </p>
<p>The law can be enforced in any of Texas’ 254 counties, including
those hundreds of miles from the border. </p>
<p>But Republican state Rep. David Spiller, the law’s author, has said
he expects most arrests would occur within 80 kilometers of the
U.S.-Mexico border. Texas’ state police chief has expressed similar
expectations.</p>
<p>Some places are off-limits. Arrests cannot be made in public and
private schools, places of worship, or hospitals and other health care
facilities, including those where sexual assault forensic examinations
are conducted.</p>
<p>It is unclear where migrants ordered to leave might go. The law says
they are to be sent to ports of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border, even
if they are not Mexican citizens. However, Mexico’s government said
Tuesday it would not accept the return of any migrants to its territory
from the state of Texas.</p>
<p>Is the law constitutional? </p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s decision did not address the constitutionality of
the law.</p>
<p>The Justice Department, legal experts and immigrant rights groups
have said it is a clear conflict with the U.S. government’s authority to
regulate immigration.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge David Ezra, an appointee of former President
Ronald Reagan, agreed in a 114-page order. He added that the law could
hamper U.S. foreign relations and treaty obligations.</p>
<p>Opponents have called the measure the most dramatic attempt by a
state to police immigration since a 2010 Arizona law — denounced by
critics as the “Show Me Your Papers” bill — that was largely struck down
by the U.S. Supreme Court. Ezra cited the Supreme Court’s 2012 Arizona
ruling in his decision.</p>
<p>Texas has argued that the law mirrors federal law instead of
conflicting with it. </p>
<p>What is happening on the border? </p>
<p>Arrests for illegal crossings along the southern border fell by half
in January from record highs in December. Border Patrol officials
attributed the shift to seasonal declines and heightened enforcement by
the U.S. and its allies. The federal government has not yet released
numbers for February.</p>
<p>Texas has charged thousands of migrants with trespassing on private
property under a more limited operation that began in 2021.</p>
<p>Tensions remain between Texas and the Biden administration. In the
border city of Eagle Pass, Texas, National Guard members have prevented
Border Patrol agents from accessing a riverfront park.</p>
<p>Other Republican governors have expressed support for Abbott, who has
said the federal government is not doing enough to enforce immigration
laws. Other measures implemented by Texas include a floating barrier in
the Rio Grande and razor wire along the border.</p>

<h2 id="china-not-russia-still-tops-list-of-threats-to-us">China, Not
Russia, Still Tops List of Threats to US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Russia’s war in Ukraine — portrayed by top U.S.
officials as posing a danger to the United States itself — still trails
China when it comes to long-term threats to America’s security,
according to a top Pentagon official.</p>
<p>The warning from Ely Ratner, the Defense Department’s assistant
secretary for Indo-Pacific security affairs, comes in testimony prepared
for a hearing Wednesday by the House Armed Services Committee on
security challenges in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>“The PRC [People’s Republic of China] continues to present the most
comprehensive and serious challenge to our national security,” Ratner is
set to tell lawmakers, according to a copy his opening statement
obtained by VOA.</p>
<p>“The PRC remains the only country with the will and increasingly the
capability to dominate the Indo-Pacific region and displace the United
States,” Ratner warns, adding, “the PRC is pursuing its revisionist
goals with increasingly coercive activities in the Taiwan Strait, the
South and East China seas, along the Line of Actual Control with India,
and beyond.”</p>
<p>This is not the first time Ratner has addressed the growing threat
from Beijing.</p>
<p>In October he called out China’s military for what he described as a
“sharp increase” in risky behavior in the East and South China seas.</p>
<p>Ratner also cautioned, separately, that China’s leaders were
“increasingly turning to the PLA [People’s Liberation Army] as an
instrument of coercion.”</p>
<p>Additionally, the Pentagon’s annual China Military Power report said
that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing faster than expected,
while Beijing is building out the infrastructure needed for a further
expansion of its nuclear forces.</p>
<p>China has responded to such allegations by accusing the U.S. of
“hyping up” the threat.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin issued a warning of
his own, emphasizing the threat from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>“The United States stands by Ukraine because it’s the right thing to
do,” Austin told a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in
Ramstein, Germany. “But we also stand by Ukraine because it’s crucial to
our own security.”</p>
<p>“The United States would face grave new perils in a world where
aggression and autocracy are on the march and where tyrants are
emboldened and where dictators think that they can wipe out democracy
off the map,” he said.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence officials argued recently that the threats from
Russia and China are linked, and that Russia’s war has served to
embolden China’s leadership.</p>
<p>Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told lawmakers earlier
this month that Beijing has managed to get long-sought concessions from
Moscow in exchange for support for Russia’s war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>And CIA Director William Burns said Russian success in Ukraine could
“stoke the ambitions of the Chinese leadership in contingencies ranging
from Taiwan to the South China Sea.”</p>
<p>Ratner is set to tell U.S. lawmakers Wednesday that the Defense
Department is working to strengthen key alliances in the Indo-Pacific
and develop what he calls a “regional force posture” including Japan,
South Korea, the Philippines and Australia.</p>
<p>He is also set to testify that the Pentagon’s proposed 2025 budget is
placing a priority on investments in air, sea and undersea power, as
well as in modernizing U.S. nuclear forces with an eye toward Beijing’s
own military modernization efforts.</p>

id="biden-trump-notch-wins-other-races-offer-hints-on-national-politics">Biden,
Trump Notch Wins; Other Races Offer Hints on National Politics</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio — As Joe Biden and Donald Trump moved closer to a
November rematch, primary voters around the country on Tuesday urged
their favored candidate to keep up the fight and worried about what
might happen if their side loses this fall.</p>
<p>There was little suspense about Tuesday’s results as both candidates
are already their parties’ presumptive nominees. Trump easily won
Republican primaries in Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Kansas and Ohio.
Biden did the same except in Florida, where Democrats had canceled their
primary and opted to award all 224 of their delegates to Biden.</p>
<p>Instead, the primaries and key downballot races became a reflection
of the national political mood. With many Americans unenthusiastic about
2024’s choice for the White House, both Biden and Trump’s campaigns are
working to fire up their bases by tearing into each other and warning of
the perils of the opponent.</p>
<p>Those who did turn out to vote Tuesday seemed to hear that.</p>
<p>Pat Shackleford, an 84-year-old caregiver in Mesa, Arizona, said she
voted for Trump in Arizona’s primary to send the former president a
message.</p>
<p>“I wanted to encourage him that the fight has been worthwhile, that
more of us are behind him than maybe the media tells you,” Shackleford
said.</p>
<p>Jamie and Cassandra Neal, sisters who both live in Phoenix, said they
were unenthusiastic Biden supporters until they saw the vigor the
president brought to his State of the Union speech. It fired them up for
the coming election.</p>
<p>“Beforehand it was like, ‘Well, he’s the only decent one there,’”
said Cassandra Neal, 42. “After his address it was like, ‘OK, let’s do
it!’”</p>
<p>Jamie Neal, 45, said Biden had been “way too nice” before and needed
to match Trump, whom she described as “vicious.”</p>
<p>“I hate to say it, sometimes you need to equal the lowness to get the
person out,” she said. “Sometimes you have to fight fire with fire.”</p>
<p>In Ohio’s Republican Senate primary, Trump-backed businessman Bernie
Moreno defeated two challengers, Ohio Secretary of State Frank Frank
LaRose and Matt Dolan, whose family owns the Cleveland Guardians
baseball team.</p>
<p>Moreno and Trump appeared together Saturday at a rally where Trump
praised his endorsed candidate as a “warrior” and ramped up his dark
rhetoric, saying that were he not to be elected, “it’s going to be a
bloodbath for the country.” His campaign insists he was referring to the
auto industry and not the country as a whole.</p>
<p>In the final days of the campaign, The Associated Press reported on
Thursday that in 2008, someone with access to Moreno’s work email
account created a profile on an adult website seeking “Men for 1-on-1
sex.” The AP could not definitively confirm that it was created by
Moreno himself. Moreno’s lawyer said a former intern created the account
and provided a statement from the intern, Dan Ricci, who said he created
the account as “part of a juvenile prank.”</p>
<p>Questions about the profile have circulated in GOP circles for the
past month, sparking frustration among senior Republican operatives
about Moreno’s potential vulnerability in a general election, according
to seven people who are directly familiar with conversations about how
to address the matter. They requested anonymity to avoid running afoul
of Trump and his allies.</p>
<p>Trump and Biden have for weeks been focused on the general election,
aiming their campaigns lately on states that could be competitive in
November rather than merely those holding primaries.</p>
<p>Trump, a Florida voter, cast his ballot at a recreation center in
Palm Beach on Tuesday and told reporters, “I voted for Donald
Trump.”</p>
<p>Trump and Biden are running on their records in office and casting
the other as a threat to America. Trump, 77, portrays the 81-year-old
Biden as mentally unfit. The president has described his Republican
rival as a threat to democracy after his attempt to overturn the 2020
election results and his praise of foreign strongmen.</p>
<p>Those themes were evident Tuesday at some polling locations.</p>
<p>“President Biden, I don’t think he knows how to tie his shoes
anymore,” said Trump supporter Linda Bennet, a resident of Palm Beach
Gardens, Florida, not far from the former president’s Mar-a-Lago
resort.</p>
<p>Even as she echoed Trump’s arguments about Biden, she criticized
Trump’s rhetoric and “the way he composes himself” as “not presidential
at all.” But she said the former president is “a man of his word,” and
she said the country, especially the economy, felt stronger to her under
Trump’s leadership.</p>
<p>In Columbus, Ohio, Democrat Brenda Woodfolk voted for Biden and
shared the president’s framing of the choice this fall.</p>
<p>“It’s scary,” she said of the prospect that Trump could be in the
Oval Office again. “Trump wants to be a dictator, talking about making
America white again and all this kind of crap. There’s too much hate
going on.”</p>
<p>Bennet and Woodfolk agreed that immigration is one of their top
concerns, though they offered different takes on why.</p>
<p>“This border thing is out of control,” said Bennet, the Republican
voter. “I think it’s the government’s plot or plan to bring these people
in to change the whole dynamic for their benefit, so I’m pretty
peeved.”</p>
<p>Woodfolk, the Democrat, said she doesn’t mind immigrants “sharing”
opportunities in the U.S. but worried it comes at the expense of “people
who’ve been here all their lives.”</p>
<p>Trump and Republicans have hammered Biden on the influx of migrants
crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in recent years, seeking to capitalize
on the issue well beyond border states. Biden has ratcheted up a
counteroffensive in recent weeks after Senate Republicans killed a
migration compromise they had negotiated with the White House,
withholding their support only after Trump said he opposed the deal.
Biden has used the circumstances to argue that Trump and Republicans
have no interest in solving the issue but instead want to inflame voters
in an election year.</p>
<p>For the last year, Trump has coupled his campaign with his legal
challenges, including dozens of criminal counts and civil cases in which
he faces more than $500 million in fines.</p>
<p>His first criminal trial was scheduled to start Monday in New York on
allegations he falsified business records to cover up hush money
payments. But a judge delayed the trial for 30 days after the recent
disclosure of new evidence that Trump’s lawyers said they needed time to
review.</p>
<p>Speaking outside his polling place with a voter’s sticker affixed to
his lapel, Trump insisted the cases against him were political and
defended himself against criticism of his attacks a day earlier on
Jewish Democrats, in which he alleged they hate Israel and their own
religion. Democratic leaders on Tuesday criticized his comments as
promoting antisemitic tropes about having divided loyalties.</p>
<p>Standing next to him was former first lady Melania Trump, who didn’t
have on a sticker. She has rarely appeared in public with Trump since he
launched his third bid for the White House.</p>
<p>Asked if she would campaign with him, she replied: “Stay tuned.”</p>

Muslim Groups Plan to Boycott White House Ramadan</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — American Muslims outraged by President Joe Biden’s
support of Israel say they will not take part in White House Ramadan and
Eid celebrations this year as they continue to demand that the
administration push for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza.</p>
<p>Should an invitation come, it’s “widely understood” that American
Muslim community leaders and organizations will decline, said Robert
McCaw, director of the Government Affairs Department at the Council on
American-Islamic Relations, CAIR.</p>
<p>“This decision is due to the administration’s failure to address
Muslim community demands for an immediate and permanent cease-fire,”
McCaw told VOA. “And its refusal to stop supplying manufactured weapons
to Israel, which are being used in a genocide against our Palestinian
brothers and sisters in Gaza.”</p>
<p>Amid media reports that the administration is considering scaling
back Ramadan events at the White House, press secretary Karine
Jean-Pierre said no celebration related to the holy month has been
announced.</p>
<p>“We understand that it is a painful time for a number of
communities,” she told VOA during her press briefing Monday. Senior
White House officials have met with members of the Arab, Muslim and
Palestinian communities “to talk about their views, to voice their
concerns, and we welcome that,” she added.</p>
<p>The suffering of the Palestinian people “will be front of mind for
many” Muslims this Ramadan, President Joe Biden said in a statement
marking the beginning of the month. “It is front of mind for me.”</p>
<p>Since taking office, Biden has continued the decadeslong White House
tradition of hosting Muslim community leaders that began with President
Bill Clinton in 1996. Both Republican and Democratic presidents have
hosted iftar dinner during Ramadan or an Eid al Fitr reception to mark
the end of fasting after the month.</p>
<p>But this year, in addition to potentially facing the embarrassment of
a massive boycott, the White House would likely want to avoid scenes
where Biden is shouted at and heckled by pro-Palestinian protesters.
Several of them have disrupted his campaign events around the
country.</p>
<p>Outrage over Gaza is also affecting Nowruz, the Persian New Year
celebrated by diaspora groups of varying ethnicity and religious
affiliation from countries beyond Iran, including Iraq, Afghanistan,
India, Pakistan, Turkey, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and
Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>Nowruz this year overlaps with Ramadan. And instead of inviting
hundreds of people to a reception as the administration has done in the
past, this weekend the White House will be hosting a “Nowruz Open House
tour.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure if the president himself would participate,” said
Jawaid Kotwal, board member of the Afghan American Foundation. “So it’s
way different. A watered-down, downgraded version of the typical Nowruz
celebrations that we had in the White House.”</p>
<p>Kotwal told VOA that he personally declined the invitation but his
organization will “look for any avenue to continue to have engagement
with any occupant of the White House.”</p>
<p>The White House has not responded to requests for further details on
its Nowruz or Ramadan plans.</p>
<p>In his statement marking Nowruz, Biden said the war has “inflicted
terrible suffering on the Palestinian people,” and vowed to “continue to
lead international efforts to get more humanitarian assistance to
them.”</p>
<p>Clouded by controversy</p>
<p>This year is not the first time Ramadan at the White House is clouded
with controversy. In his first year in office, President Donald Trump,
who campaigned on banning Muslims from entering the United States and
signed multiple executive orders restricting immigration from
Muslim-majority countries, did not host a Ramadan event.</p>
<p>In 2018 and 2019, Trump welcomed diplomats from Muslim-majority
nations to the White House for iftar, but American Muslim organizations
and lawmakers were not on the guest list. At the time, American Muslim
groups said they would have declined had they been invited.</p>
<p>Some American Muslims boycotted Biden’s virtual Eid celebrations in
May 2021 as hostilities escalated between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. More
than 260 Palestinians were killed in that round of violence, according
to the United Nations.</p>
<p>That death toll is a fraction of the more than 31,000 Palestinians
killed since Israel launched its military campaign in response to the
Hamas October 7 attacks that took at least 1,200 lives in Israel and
more than 240 people hostage. The level of anger felt now by American
Muslims, Arabs and wide swaths of Biden’s Democratic base is also
exponentially higher.</p>
<p>The community, including those who work in the administration, would
feel “gaslit” by a White House Ramadan event this year, said Tariq
Habash, a Palestinian American and former policy adviser at the
Department of Education who resigned in protest in January.</p>
<p>“You can’t in one hand try and show solidarity and understanding and
then in the other hand supply an unrestricted amount of weapons and
military funding to an extremist government that is intent on the
indiscriminate bombing and killing of civilians,” Habash told VOA.</p>
<p>The White House said it has actively engaged with Arab and Muslim
Americans since the October 7 Hamas attack. Some in the community have
refused to meet with administration officials.</p>

Africa Accuses US Congress of Adding it to a New ‘Axis of Evil’ Over
Israel Genocide Case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — South Africa seeks to limit the damage to its relations
with Washington caused by its legal challenge to Israel’s assault on
Gaza, a South African official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Naledi Pandor, who is South Africa’s minister of international
relations and cooperation, is in Washington seeking to sway members of
the U.S. Congress from a proposed law that would further strain U.S.
ties to Africa’s most vibrant democracy and a major mining, banking and
manufacturing hub.</p>
<p>“I think there’s an attempt to take up punitive action against South
Africa, this sort of axis of evil notion that’s very much part of the
political culture,” Pandor said in response to a question from VOA at
South Africa’s embassy in Washington.</p>
<p>In December, South Africa filed an application to institute
proceedings against Israel at the United Nations’ top court. Pretoria
argues that Israel’s actions in Gaza are “genocidal in character,” and
aim to “destroy Palestinians in Gaza.”</p>
<p>In March, South Africa requested further measures from the
International Court of Justice, accusing Israel of weaponizing
starvation by preventing humanitarian aid from reaching the sealed-off
exclave.</p>
<p>Israel’s government has denounced the case, and the White House told
VOA in January it considers it “meritless.”</p>
<p>The case has since inspired a bipartisan push in the U.S. Congress
for legislation mandating a full review of the bilateral relationship
with South Africa. The draft bill, filed by Republican Representative
John James and Democratic Representative Jared Moskowitz, claims that
the actions of South Africa’s long-ruling African National Congress “are
inconsistent with its publicly stated policy of nonalignment in
international affairs.”</p>
<p>“South Africa has been building ties to countries and actors that
undermine America’s national security and threaten our way of life
through its military and political cooperation with China and Russia and
its support of U.S.-designated terrorist organization Hamas,” James said
in a statement when he introduced the bill in February. “We must examine
our alliances and disentangle from those who remain willing to work with
our adversaries.”</p>
<p>Pandor, who also met with think tanks and spoke publicly while in
Washington, said she intended to remind members of Congress of the value
of South Africa, on its own and as a gateway to the continent.</p>
<p>“We believe that any action to diminish the relationship would be
most unwise,” she said, in response to another question from VOA.
“Because these are two key democracies in the regions in which we
exist.”</p>
<p>She said she believes the relationship between the United States and
South Africa can help to promote peace and democracy on the African
continent — and to support the agenda of development in Africa —
“because I can’t imagine how initiatives directed at greater trade and
development would become operational if the institutional capacity of
South Africa is not utilized.”</p>
<p>South Africa is also a major beneficiary of the African Growth and
Opportunity Act, which offers duty-free U.S. market access to 32 African
nations. Congress must vote on whether to extend the program beyond
2025.</p>
<p>VOA asked Pandor whether the high-stakes diplomatic pushback has been
worth it.</p>
<p>“What I do know is if there’s a struggle underway, the longer you
take to address the demands of a struggle, the more violent and vicious
the struggle becomes,” she replied. “So, the sooner you address peace
and negotiations, the greater the opportunity for everybody to enjoy
peace and security. This is the lesson of South Africa.”</p>
<p>And VOA asked analyst Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East
program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, if South
Africa’s case had done anything to stop the conflict between Israel and
Hamas.</p>
<p>“I don’t think South Africa has reframed this conflict. I don’t think
South Africa has really changed the direction at this point,” he said.
“But it’s a thread that runs through it — this concern that South Africa
has history which makes it especially sensitive to issues of
discrimination and genocide. … It certainly added an element to
conversation that wasn’t there until South Africa pushed it as
aggressively as it did.”</p>
<p>Pandor, a veteran member of the long-ruling African National
Congress, stressed that Pretoria’s problem is not with the White House.
She told VOA she had not sought meetings with President Joe Biden or
Secretary of State Antony Blinken during her Washington visit.</p>
<p>“The executive understands [South Africa] far more than Congress,”
she said.</p>
<p>When asked what she’d tell Biden, Pandor’s answer was short.</p>
<p>“Cease-fire,” she said. “Now.”</p>

<h2 id="how-to-write-a-qml-effect-for-kwin">How to write a QML effect
for KWin</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>In order solve that problem, we started looking for some options and
the most obvious one was QtQuick. It’s a quite powerful framework and
it’s already used extensively in Plasma. So, in Plasma 5.24, we
introduced basic support for implementing kwin effects written in QML
and even added a new overview effect. Unfortunately, if you wanted to
implement a QtQuick-based effect yourself, you would still have to write
a bit of C++ glue yourself. This is not great because effects that use
C++ are a distribution nightmare. They can’t be just uploaded to the KDE
Store and then installed by clicking “Get New Effects…”. Furthermore,
libkwin is a fast moving target with lots of ABI and API incompatible
changes in every release. That’s not good if you’re an effect developer
because it means you will need to invest a bit of time after every
plasma release to port the effects to the new APIs or at least rebuild
the effects to resolve ABI incompatibilities. This has been changed in
Plasma 6.0. In Plasma 6, we’ve had the opportunity to address that pesky
problem of requiring some C++ code and also improve the declarative
effect API after learning some lessons while working on the overview and
other effects. So, enough of history and let’s jump to the good stuff,
shall we? ↫ Vlad Zahorodnii Making it easier to write things like Plasma
widgets and Kwin effects is always desirable, and making them easier to
distribute is only icing on the cake.</p>

id="trump-urges-us-supreme-court-to-endorse-absolute-immunity-for-ex-presidents">Trump
Urges US Supreme Court to Endorse ‘Absolute Immunity’ for
Ex-Presidents</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Donald Trump’s legal team on Tuesday filed a U.S.
Supreme Court brief in his bid for criminal immunity, arguing that a
former president enjoys “absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for
his official acts.”</p>
<p>The case is to be argued before the justices on April 25.</p>
<p>Trump has appealed a lower court’s rejection of his request to be
shielded from the criminal case being pursued by Special Counsel Jack
Smith because he was serving as president when he took the actions at
the center of the case. Trump is charged with trying to overturn his
2020 election loss.</p>
<p>The filing advances arguments similar to ones Trump’s lawyers
previously have made and echoes statements he has made on the campaign
trail as he seeks to regain the presidency.  </p>
<p>Trump, the first former president to be criminally prosecuted, is the
Republican candidate challenging Democratic President Joe Biden in the
Nov. 5 U.S. election. Biden defeated Trump in 2020.</p>
<p>Smith was appointed by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland in
November 2022. In August 2023, Smith brought four federal criminal
counts against Trump in the election subversion case, including
conspiring to defraud the United States, obstructing the congressional
certification of Biden’s electoral victory and conspiring to do so, and
conspiring against the right of Americans to vote.</p>
<p>In a filing to the justices in February, Smith sought to make the
case against presidential immunity.</p>
<p>“The nation has a compelling interest in seeing the charges brought
to trial,” Smith said in the filing, adding that “the public interest in
a prompt trial is at its zenith where, as here, a former president is
charged with conspiring to subvert the electoral process so that he
could remain in office.”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s decision to hear arguments on Trump’s immunity
bid next month postponed the trial, giving him a boost as he tries to
delay prosecutions while running to regain the presidency. Trump has
three other pending criminal cases. He has pleaded not guilty in all
four cases, seeking to paint them as politically motivated.</p>
<p>Trump last October sought to have the charges dismissed based on his
claim of immunity. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan rejected that claim
in December.  </p>
<p>On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit on Feb. 6 ruled 3-0 against Trump’s immunity claim, rejecting
his bid for “unbounded authority to commit crimes that would neutralize
the most fundamental check on executive power - the recognition and
implementation of election results.”</p>
<p>The case once again thrusts the nation’s top judicial body, whose 6-3
conservative majority includes three justices appointed by Trump, into
the election fray.</p>
<p>Trump and his allies made false claims that the 2020 election was
stolen and devised a plan to use false electors to thwart congressional
certification of Biden’s victory. Trump also sought to pressure
then-Vice President Mike Pence not to allow certification to go forward.
Trump’s supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a bid
to prevent the certification.</p>
<p>If Trump regains the presidency, he could seek to use his powers to
force an end to the prosecution or potentially pardon himself for any
federal crimes.</p>

<h2 id="john-romero-doesnt-believe-in-prototypes">John Romero doesn’t
believe in prototypes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
A couple weeks ago I joined
<a href="https://social.lol/@tylersticka/112005607463887992">a
conversation about John Romero and prototypes</a>.
<a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/the-possibility-bridge/">Tyler
posted some thoughts about Romero’s autobiography</a>,
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@matthiasott/112005791745972036">Matthias
shared a quote from a Tim Ferris podcast</a> where Romero chided
prototypes, and Matthias looped me in because I love prototypes.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
No prototypes. Just make the game. Polish as you go. Don’t depend on
polish happening later. Always maintain constantly shippable code.<br />
– John Romero,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzqdZAYcwfY">Strange Loop
2002</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A quick internet conversation changed the course of my week a bit. After
that short exchange I dove in and listened to podcasts, watched a
handful of talks, and read an entire
<a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/doom-guy-life-in-first-person-john-romero/18230638?ean=9781419758119">autobiography</a>…
and I’m still shocked that John Romero doesn’t believe in prototypes.
</p>
<h2>
id Software is synonymous with speed
</h2>
<p>
To understand Romero’s perspective you need to understand the ethos of
id Software. id Software was –to borrow a gaming term– a “Press W”
company, meaning they tend to plow through all obstacles to keep forward
momentum. As Romero recounts in his biography, they prioritized speed
above all other design principles.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Speed in gameplay
</li>
<li>
Speed in development
</li>
<li>
Speed in using the latest tech
</li>
<li>
Speed in heavy metal MIDI soundtracks
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Romero and Carmack were also prolific developers.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Romero#Games">Romero has
over 100 titles to his name</a> and in 1991 they released 15 games! And
they did this while simultaneously pioneering 3D video game graphics for
Wolfenstein 3D (1992) and DOOM (1993). How did they maintain such
velocity?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Good division of labor.</strong> Carmack worked on the game
engine, Romero on the level design, and Tom Hall did the art.
</li>
<li>
<strong>They lived together.</strong> I’m not advocating for workplace
cohabitation, but I think you need to acknowledge the contextual
environment.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Knew the hardware.</strong> Carmack and Romero were intimately
familiar with the limitations of the hardware they were developing
against which made porting games to other platforms (Commodore, Amiga,
etc) a lot more predictable.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Always rewriting</strong>. They were always rewriting using the
latest tech. Take an existing title and use the latest graphic
capabilities, take an existing title and make it with the latest engine,
rinse and repeat.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Built internal tools.</strong> Romero built internal tools to
speed up level design:
<a href="https://keenwiki.shikadi.net/wiki/TED5">TEd</a> (a text-based
level editor), <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/DoomEd">DoomEd</a>,
and <a href="https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/QuakeEd">QuakeEd</a>. Romero
frequently talks about making DOOM levels in a single night.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Predictable scope.</strong> While the underlying graphics or
physics engine might change dramatically, the formula for the scope of
the game (number episodes, levels, weapons, and types of enemies) stayed
nearly the same so you could repeat processes, reduce code churn, and
avoid surprise hardware limitations.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That formula gave the team a lot of shots on goal. To use another sports
metaphor, that’s a lot of reps. id Software was crunch time all the
time. Abiding in that breakneck thrill ride enabled them to create
groundbreaking, industry-defining titles like DOOM and Quake.
</p>
<h2>
Back to prototypes and the lack thereof…
</h2>
<p>
Okay. Back to the main plot. John Romero doesn’t like prototypes…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“No prototypes. Just make the game. Polish as you go.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Speed is great, but process effects outcomes. In Romero’s own words
“Don’t depend on polish happening later” which is something those of us
in tech know all too well. You’re probably going to run up against
“<a href="https://devopedia.org/iron-triangle">the Iron Triangle</a>” at
some point.
</p>
<p>
I’m not trying to throw shade – I will never be as successful as id
Software – but here’s a side-by-side of two similar side-scroller games.
</p>
<figure>
<div class="gallery"
style="display:grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: var(--fluid-pad, 1.5vw); max-width: 640px;">
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/mario.png" alt="Super Mario Bros (1985)">
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/keen.png" alt="Commander Keen (1990)"></p>
</div>
</figure>
<p>
One is a game from a company that prioritizes prototyping and using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpei_Yokoi#Lateral_Thinking_with_Withered_Technology">withered
technology</a> (Super Mario Bros, 1985), the other is a clone of that
game from a company that prioritizes shipping quick on the latest
hardware (Commander Keen, 1990). This isn’t an attempt to strip the game
of its technical achievements, bringing Nintendo-like games to the PC,
but there’s a palpable difference between the two; one is timeless and
one is timely. While a myriad of skill, staffing, and technology factors
contribute to the
difference<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>,
I believe the biggest delta comes down to pressing the publish button
too early.
</p>
<p>
There’s a
<a href="https://www.acriticalhit.com/solved-miyamoto-quote-late-game-bad-forever">famously
misattributed</a> quote that seems apropos here…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“A delayed game is eventually good. A bad game is bad forever.”<br /> –
Siobahn Beeman, often misattributed to Shigeru Miyamoto
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Who cares if some “<a href="https://arc.net/l/quote/brzalrzi">not
spectacular</a>” graphics slipped out the door? That game, Commander
Keen, was successful. id Software was successful. Over and over. From my
perspective that comes down to the sheer volume of ideas they shipped,
that continuous practice, and their novel shareware distribution model
coinciding with the explosion of the internet and the PC. You need to be
responsive and reactive to that wave and if there’s a commitment to
release a new product every month, then I wouldn’t recommend a thinking
tool like prototypes under those limitations either.
</p>
<p>
Do I –without evidence– believe they actually did prototype a bit? Yes.
I think in the sense of experimenting with level design or evaluating
community mods, they could cheaply explore new ideas with low effort
thanks to their level editor tools. All those throwaway ideas amount to
some level of what I’d call prototyping. But I take Romero’s point that
they didn’t believe in prototyping, they were working on the product,
not an idea, and could have hit publish at any point in the process.
</p>
<p>
So I’ll concede that maybe with a pair of once-in-a-generation talent, a
perfect mixture of group workaholism, a breakneck cadence, all living in
the same house, a convergence of new technologies, quality internal
tools, the explosion of the home computer industry, an original and
extremely violent IP that appealed to the Metallica generation, and over
a hundred shots on goal… you too might be able to capture lightning in a
bottle and create a smash hit like “the entire concept of 3D video
games”…
</p>
<p>
… but for the rest of us there’s prototypes.

<p class="drop-caps">
If there was ever any question that Donald Trump would be the 2024
Republican nominee, there isn’t anymore. Since he vacated the White
House in 2021, the former president has silenced
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/first-republican-2024-debate-climate-change" target="_self">numerous
rivals</a> within his party — most recently ending Nikki Haley’s
campaign in a Super Tuesday
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/05/super-tuesday-trump-biden-results" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">near-sweep</a>
— as well as
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/04/1230453714/supreme-court-trump-colorado-ballot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">legal
challenges</a> to his ability to run for federal office, leaving him the
last Republican candidate standing. And if
<a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-biden" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">current
general election polls</a> are any indication, Trump isn’t slowing down
as he turns his attention to unseating President Joe Biden.
</p>
<p>
The Trump vs. Biden rematch will serve in part as a referendum on the
latter’s climate agenda — namely, the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/the-inflation-reduction-act-remains-astonishing" target="_self">Inflation
Reduction Act</a>, the landmark climate legislation enacted in 2022. In
the years since the IRA’s passage, Republicans have
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/2024-election-climate-trump" target="_self">become
savvier</a> in their attacks on climate change, honing their rhetoric
and misinformation about EVs, the energy transition, and climate science
more broadly. The Heritage Foundation even published an extensive
playbook for how, exactly, Trump should
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self">dismantle
most of the progress on the green transition</a>.
</p>
<p>
The stakes are consequential, to say the least: One recent estimate by
<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-trump-election-win-could-add-4bn-tonnes-to-us-emissions-by-2030/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CarbonBrief</a>
found that a Trump reelection would add an extra 4 billion tons of
carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030 compared to a Biden reelection. That
is enough to “negate – twice over – all of the savings from deploying
wind, solar, and other clean technologies around the world over the past
five years,” the report said.
</p>
<p>
With the climate agenda on the line, Heatmap is keeping a running list
of Trump’s climate-related statements on the campaign trail. We’ve
looked at his rallies, TV appearances, and social media comments, and
compiled a list of his most frequent and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-ev-charging" target="_blank">glaringly
inaccurate</a> claims since he vacated the White House in January 2021.
</p>
<p>
If you’re looking for just the new stuff — on whether infrastructure for
charging electric vehicles will <a href="#3-trillion">bankrupt</a> the
U.S. economy (spoiler alert: it won’t), on whether we’re sending
“<a href="#tar">tar</a>” up into the atmosphere (nope), and that
infamous <a href="#bloodbath">bloodbath</a> comment (actually about EVs)
— you can find those via these helpful links.
</p>
<p>
While some of his musings (okay, fine, a lot of them) might be laughably
absurd, others might be something you’ve wondered about yourself. To
help you better separate fact from fiction, we’ve added context and
explanation to each quote, along with a bottom-line determination of the
remark’s facticity.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, this list is a work in progress and will be regularly updated
and added to in the coming months, so if you’re ever in doubt, know that
you can find the answer somewhere in here. For ease of navigation, we’ve
broken things down into sections:

well-being — as well as
<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/stephen-colbert-trump-climate-gaffe-b2483334.html" target="_blank">a
late-night bit by Stephen Colbert</a>. While <strong>it’s unclear
exactly what Trump was going on about</strong>, we <em>can</em> get a
few things straight:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
“Clime” is usually used as a geographic term to refer to a
<em>particular</em> region’s climate. As in, “<em>We left New York for
the warmer climes of Florida.” </em>The Oxford Learner’s Dictionary says
its use is usually “literary or humorous.”
</li>
<br/>
<li>
“Climate” refers to weather patterns in a given area, taken as a whole.
“When scientists talk about climate, they’re often looking at averages
of precipitation, temperature, humidity, sunshine, wind, and other
measures of weather that occur over a long period in a particular
place,”
<a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/weather-vs-climate" target="_blank">NOAA
explains</a>. (A 30-year window is pretty typical when speaking about a
place’s climate.)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And just for good measure, “weather” differs from “climate” or “clime”
in that it refers to short-term meteorological events in a specific
place. So while the <em>weather</em> on a given day, week, or month can
be unseasonably cold, the overall <em>climate</em> can still be warming.
</p>
<blockquote>
<em>“You know they don’t call it global warming so much now, they call
it climate change because it wasn’t working … Global warming wasn’t
working when it was cooling. So now they call it climate change, that
takes care of everything.”</em>
[<a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1732231225895432458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1732231225895432458%7Ctwgr%5E382b4d715f43b24d62c3fe54ba69a436836e41a6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-35245541441656720993.ampproject.net%2F2312012346000%2Fframe.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dec. 5,

<p>
<strong>Fact check: </strong>The term “climate change” was initially
popularized by Republicans. In a
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/02/us/a-call-for-softer-greener-language.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2002
memo</a>, Republican pollster Frank Luntz urged President George W. Bush
to drop the phrase “global warming” in favor of “climate change” since
the former sounds more “frightening” and “has catastrophic
communications attached to it,” while “climate change sounds a more
controllable and less emotional challenge.”
</p>
<p>
That said, <strong>scientists generally prefer the term “climate
change”</strong> for pretty much exactly the reason Trump highlighted
here — because it encompasses phenomena caused by the increase in CO2 in
our atmosphere that don’t manifest as warming, like ocean acidification.
For the record: Global warming doesn’t mean that the weather will
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/east-west-flood-blizzard-storm" target="_self">never
get cold</a>, just that it will get <em>less</em> cold on average, over
time. In fact,
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00498-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research</a>
shows that the cold parts of the globe are warming much, much faster
than the rest.

<p>
<strong>Fact check</strong><strong>: That’s … true, actually.</strong>
“When the atmosphere warms, that means it can hold more water,” Matthew
Rodell, the deputy director of Earth sciences for hydrosphere,
biosphere, and geophysics at NASA,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/03/14/climate/extreme-weather-climate-change.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who
has made an extensive study of extreme drought and deluges</a>, told me.
That means there will be both more droughts <em>and </em>more rainfall,
even though the two phenomena might appear at a glance to contradict
each other.
</p>
<p>
“On the drought side of things, when the air is warmer, more water can
evaporate — can be pulled out of the land and out of the plants, into
the air, and then transported away,” Rodell explained. “So you have,
basically, more water being net removed from an area.” But water in the
air has to return to Earth, eventually, in the form of more — and often
extreme — rainfall.
</p>
<p>
Shouldn’t those two extremes effectively balance each other out? As
Rodell put it to me, “Floods and droughts are both catastrophes.” During
a drought, crops die and wells go dry. And while extreme rainfall might
refill an aquifer, “if it’s at the point of being extreme and there’s a
flood,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/libya-floods-storm-daniel-derna" target="_self">that’s
not good, either</a>.” Think about Libya, where extended heavy rains in
the summer of 2023 broke through dams and inundated towns, killing 4,300
people, displacing an estimated 44,800 more, and causing
<a href="https://www.trtafrika.com/africa/libya-allocates-dollar446m-for-post-flood-repairs-14939356" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">over
$60 million in damage</a>.
</p>
<p>
One last thing to mention here: While our ability to determine the
precise contribution of climate change to individual extreme weather
events is improving rapidly, that is, in some ways, beside the point.
Rodell explained that “in terms of the frequency, and looking at all
these events together and how they’ve changed over time, we’re seeing
that they’re increasing in number and severity in correlation with
global warming. That doesn’t mean you can say any particular event is
100% by global warming, but, I mean — statistically, it’s <em>extremely
unlikely</em> that this is just a coincidence.”

<p>
<strong>Fact check: While it’s true that the climate has always changed,
it hasn’t always changed like <em>this</em>.</strong> The rapid rise in
both atmospheric carbon dioxide <em>and </em>observed average surface
temperature since the Industrial Revolution can only be credited to
humans, and specifically to the burning of fossil fuels, which release
CO2, a heat-trapping gas. There is now
near-universal<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
scientific consensus</a> that the warming we’re witnessing has been
caused by human activity.
</p>
<p>
“The most popular climate myths are the ones that are simple and easy to
say,” as John Cook, a senior research fellow at Melbourne University’s
School of Psychological Sciences who’s made a
<a href="https://youtu.be/JuUz2AwoSko?list=PL1xbdG-NAkB1fAyNAWErM4uEXyduldiew&t=750" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">specialty</a>

<a href="https://youtu.be/H5kejSYPD7U" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">climate
disinformation</a>, told me. “It’s the single-cause fallacy, thinking
that only one thing can cause natural causes. But you can have other
things like human activity that also drive climate change,” Cook added.
</p>
<p>
Start digging into this kind of logic and it quickly falls apart. For
example, Trump’s argument is that the climate has changed naturally in
the past; therefore, it must be changing naturally now, as well. But,
Cook told me, the same logic could also be used to argue, <em>People
have died of cancer in the past; therefore, cigarettes don’t cause
cancer now</em>.

<strong>Fact check:</strong> For starters, <strong>Trump’s numbers are
orders of magnitude off the mark. </strong>The oceans are on track to
rise <em>3.5 feet to 7 feet</em> along America’s coastlines by 2100 —
well ahead of Trump’s schedule — according to
<a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/hazards/sealevelrise/sealevelrise-tech-report.html#:~:text=About%202%20feet%20(0.6%20meters,the%20end%20of%20this%20century." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an
independent assessment</a> conducted by federal scientific agencies.
Even if global carbon emissions had peaked in 2020
(<a href="https://www.iea.org/news/global-co2-emissions-rebounded-to-their-highest-level-in-history-in-2021https://www.iea.org/news/global-co2-emissions-rebounded-to-their-highest-level-in-history-in-2021" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">which
we know they did not</a>) and declined relatively rapidly thereafter,
the oceans would <em>still</em> probably rise more than 3 feet worldwide
by 2300 compared to their 2000 levels,
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-02985-8/tables/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">researchers
have found,</a> because so much heat is already trapped in the climate
system.
</p>
<p>
According to the
<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM_final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">latest
scientific report</a> from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, “sea level rise greater than 15 meters,” or 49 feet, by
the year 2300 “cannot be ruled out” in a high-emissions scenario.
</p>
<p>
While unlikely, 49 feet of sea-level rise would be catastrophic. Large
swaths of lower Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens would be completely
submerged, with waves lapping at the walls of Yankee Stadium and Citi
Field. The southern half of Florida would vanish (bye-bye, Mar-a-Lago!).
Countries like the Netherlands and Bangladesh would, literally,
disappear from the map.
</p>
<p>
As for that supposedly new oceanfront property Trump is so excited
about, scientists expect some

States by 2050 — not to mention that globally, some <em>230 million

<strong>Fact check:</strong> The U.S. will not “under any circumstances”

<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66197366" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vowed</a>
in front of Congress last year. The situation is, however — and
unsurprisingly — <strong>more complicated than that</strong>.
</p>
<p>
At COP28 last year, the U.S. pledged $17.5 million to the U.N.’s “loss
and damage” fund, which is intended to help developing countries recover
from future climate disasters. While some outlets — including

<strong>Fact check:</strong> China, India, and Russia are all Paris

international climate mitigation efforts, <strong>that hardly means the
U.S. shouldn’t try to be cleaner</strong>.
</p>
<p>
But let’s take Trump at face value here. When asked to assess if the
Paris Agreement gives an unfair advantage to nations like China and
India, law professor Daniel Bodansky at the Arizona State University
College of Law pointed out
<a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/politics/politifact/2021/01/27/fact-check-paris-climate-agreement-easier-china-india-than-united-states/4276557001/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to
<em>USA Today</em></a> that “the United States is the second biggest
emitter of greenhouse gases in the world and has higher per capita
emissions than either China or India. It is misleading to point the
finger at China and India and label them as the real polluters.”
</p>
<p>
What about the bad air flowing to us “from Asia,” then? This isn’t total
nonsense. For one thing, we <em>do</em> all share the same atmosphere;
that’s kind of the whole point of the global movement to stop climate
change. But more concretely, yes, researchers have found that pollutants
from China can make their way to the Western U.S.
</p>
<p>
Here’s where it gets awkward: “An estimated 36% of manmade sulfur
dioxide, 27% of nitrogen oxide, 22% of carbon monoxide, and 17% of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_carbon" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">black

About a fifth of each of these was associated with products exported to

<p>
<strong>Fact check:</strong> If you ever want to feel ridiculous, try
asking a scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration if windmills are making whales “a little batty.”
</p>
<p>
NOAA actively studies how “sound, vessel, and other human activities”
impact marine life, Lauren Gaches, the director of NOAA Fisheries Public
Affairs, told me over email. “At this point, <strong>there is no
scientific evidence that noise resulting from offshore wind site
characterization surveys could potentially cause mortality of
whales</strong>,” she said.
</p>
<p>
An ongoing “unusual mortality event” for humpback whales has resulted in
200 whale deaths between 2016 and June 2023 along the Atlantic coast
from Maine to Florida — that much is true. But “there are no known links
between recent large whale mortalities and ongoing offshore wind
surveys,” Gaches told me.
<a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/marine-life-distress/frequent-questions-offshore-wind-and-whales" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NOAA’s
fact page</a> on whales and offshore wind explains that of “roughly 90
whales examined, about 40% had evidence of human interaction, either
ship strike or entanglement.”
</p>
<p>
There has been some chatter about underwater surveying work disrupting
whales, which
<a href="https://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/mar/mcbem-2014-01/other/mcbem-2014-01-submission-seismic-airgun-en.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">may
be true</a> in the case of oil and gas surveys, which use seismic air
guns to penetrate deep into the ocean floor. The surveying equipment
used for offshore wind is, by contrast, used in 15-second bursts and
limited to a specific area, “so the likelihood of an animal encountering
and coming right into that sound beam is quite low,” Erica Staaterman,
the deputy director for the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s Center
for Marine Acoustics, said on

NOAA-hosted call with the press</a> early last year.
</p>
<p>
As Ben Laws, the deputy chief of NOAA’s Permits and Conservation
Division in the Office of Protected Resources, said on the same call,
“There is no information that would support any suggestion that any of
the equipment that’s being used in support of wind development for these
site characterization surveys could directly lead to the death of a
whale.”

But the context here is extremely important. Jason Ryan, a spokesperson

that, for the most part, bird deaths due to wind turbines do “not have
population-level impacts.”
</p>
<p>
There are exceptions, such as an infamous wind farm in California’s
Altamont Pass built in 1981 that “just happened to be in a place that
was really heavily used by golden eagles,” Grove told me. Because golden
eagle populations were already very low, having
<a href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/protecting_birds_of_prey_at_altamont_pass/pdfs/factsheet.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">100
or so</a> killed a year by turbines was “unsustainable.” Even in a case
like this, though, it behooves one to look at the whole picture: “They
found it was a few individual turbines that were causing the damage,”
Grove said. These days, around 60 golden eagles a year are killed in
Alameda County,

Alameda Post</em> reports</a>, and the operating company must pay steep
penalties for eagle deaths.
</p>
<p>
What’s more, “climate change is one of the greatest threats birds face,
with
<a href="https://www.audubon.org/climate/survivalbydegrees" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two-thirds
of North American species</a> at risk of extinction due to our warming
planet,” Jon Belak, senior manager of science and data analysis at The
National Audubon Society, told me in a statement. “We need to build more
wind and solar facilities to help slow the rise in global temperatures
and protect birds and their habitats from a changing climate.”
</p>
<p>
Wind farms may not have population-level impacts on birds, but fracking
does — “the onset of shale oil and gas production reduces subsequent
bird population counts by 15%,” even after accounting for factors like
weather and other land-use changes, according to one just-published,
peer-reviewed study.

<strong>Fact check:</strong> “I mean, <strong>it’s possible with any mix
of generation that if supply and demand aren’t equal, your TV will go
out</strong>. That’s just physics,” Kyri Baker, an assistant professor
of engineering at the University of Colorado, told me when I asked her
if Trump’s scenario had any merit. In other words, a power outage could
happen whether your electricity is coming from coal or natural gas or
anything else. The difference, she said, is that “wind is by nature
variable, intermittent. But it’s also not reliant on fuel like natural
gas or coal plants or even nuclear plants are.”
</p>
<p>
What happens on days when there is no wind? “Grids are extremely
regulated,” Baker explained to me. “There’s so many layers of redundancy
that aim <em>specifically</em> to not have [an outage] happen.” A grid
is made up of diverse electricity sources (for my visual learners,

as well as measures like offline backup generators, which can kick in if
need be, so service isn’t disrupted.
</p>

Battery storage is another huge part of this equation. While they’re
still fairly cutting-edge as climate technology goes, high-capacity

Of the energy sources we’re currently used to, nuclear is usually cited
as having the highest levelized cost of electricity — that is, it has

Peaker plants — gas-powered plants that run just during times of peak

<strong>Fact check:</strong> “That question is actually a little bit
tricky,” Baker, the assistant professor of engineering at the University

<strong>Fact check:</strong> “<strong>There actually are no operating
Chinese-owned EV factories in Mexico</strong>,” Ilaria Mazzocco, a
senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and
an expert on Chinese climate policy, told me. “So this is very
preemptive at this point.”
</p>
<p>
But it is also, probably, only a matter of time: BYD, which last year
passed Tesla as the world’s No. 1 EV maker, is reportedly
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/02/27/byd-no-plans-sell-evs-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">scouting
plant locations in Mexico</a>, and could confirm plans as soon as the
second half of 2024. That has made U.S. automakers justifiably nervous.
As Robinson Meyer
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/chinese-ev-cars-biden" target="_self">previously
wrote for Heatmap</a>, “BYD recently advertised an

plug-in hybrid</a> targeted at the Chinese market … Even doubling its
price with tariffs would keep it firmly among [the United States’] most
affordable new vehicles.”
</p>
<p>
In Mazzocco’s opinion, this isn’t wholly a bad thing — “there’s a point
of value to competition that we shouldn’t forget” — and the threat of
cheap Chinese EVs has already driven American

But “EVs have encapsulated everybody’s fears of competition with China,”
Mazzocco said. The rude awakening has been that they are “actually
better at something than the Americans are.” As a result, Biden and
Trump are jostling to look tougher on Beijing ahead of the election,
especially since big auto manufacturing states like Michigan and Ohio
could potentially decide control of the White House. Biden has already
ordered the Commerce Department to investigate the potential national
security threat of Chinese-made EVs, which currently make up only about
2% of EV imports; Polestar became the

<p>
<strong>Fact check:</strong> $3 trillion is a huge number, and it is
also <strong>very inaccurate in this case</strong>. While there are
valid concerns about the Biden administration’s high-speed
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/02/18/epa-electric-vehicles-car-rules/" target="_blank">electric
vehicle push</a>, Trump almost certainly got his “$3 trillion” price tag
from the <em>total</em> cost of
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/22/business/biden-infrastructure-spending.html" target="_blank">the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law</a>, which aims to address significantly
more than just the country’s EV-charging infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
In fact, the BIL earmarks a comparatively small $7.5 billion for the
development of 500,000 public charging stations, although even this is a
“generational-level investment,” Noah Barnes, the communications
director of the Electrification Coalition, told me. With just a fraction
of $3 trillion, the U.S. will be able to jumpstart the “national network
of EV chargers that will be necessary to power the next generation of
vehicles and end our dependence on oil from countries that don’t share
our values.”
</p>
<p>
But what would it cost to build and operate <em>all</em> the charging
booths necessary to meet the current federal target of zero-emission
cars making up half of new vehicle sales by 2030? A 2022 report from
<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/building-the-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-america-needs" target="_blank">McKinsey
&amp; Company estimated</a> that the U.S. will need “1.2 million public
EV chargers and 28 million private EV chargers” by 2030 to meet Biden’s
zero-emission sales goals. Those public chargers would cost about $38
billion, including the hardware, planning, and installation. Wrap in the
cost to residences, workplaces, and depots, and the total cost of public
and private charging installation approaches $97 billion. In a separate
analysis, AlixPartners, a consulting firm,
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/us-ev-charging-system-a-priority-under-bidens-2-trillion-infrastructure-plan.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a>
that it would take $50 billion to build the charging infrastructure to
meet the 2030 zero-emission vehicle goal in the U.S., and $300 billion
worldwide.
</p>
<p>
Needless to say, though, there are a thousand billions in a trillion, so
whatever way you cut it, it certainly would not cost the U.S. $3
trillion to build enough charging stations to accommodate zero-emission
vehicles.

<strong>Fact check:</strong> Trump has repeatedly slammed the Biden
administration for supposedly wanting to switch to “all-electric” tanks.
<strong>This is mostly false</strong>, though it has its roots in the
Army’s
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2022/02/10/army-military-green-climate-strategy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first-ever
climate strategy</a>, released early last year. In it, the Army stated
that it aims to electrify all noncombat vehicles by 2035 and some
tactical vehicles by 2050.
</p>
<p>
The reason the Army wants to go electric isn’t because of some woke
environmentalist agenda, though. “The primary reason the Army wants to
electrify its fighting vehicles is to reduce wartime casualties,”
<a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/us-armys-electric-tanks-on-hold-as-battery-technology-develops" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Bloomberg</em>
writes</a>. “An all-electric fleet would mean personnel wouldn’t have to
go on dangerous refueling missions that draw combat forces away from
fighting the enemy … [and] electric vehicles are also much quieter and
harder to spot on enemy surveillance systems because they generate so
little heat.”
</p>
<p>
Trump has also slammed the Air Force for
<a href="https://www.safie.hq.af.mil/Programs/Climate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its
climate action plan</a>, although the roots of his claim that Biden
wants to make jet fighters green by “losing 15% efficiency” are much
less clear. He may be referring to the Air Force’s

strategic reasons, since the Air Force reports 30% of the casualties in

<p>
<strong>Fact check: This is wrong in a number of ways.</strong> Let’s
take it from the top: First, Biden did not block the export of liquified
natural gas to other countries; he temporarily paused the approval of
new licenses to export LNG, including 17 that had been in the, er,
pipeline. The United States is already the top exporter of LNG in the
world, with output expected to double by the end of the decade from
projects that are already licensed and under construction. The LNG
licensing pause “will not impact our ability to continue supplying LNG
to our allies in the near-term,” the Biden administration has said;
current exports have been more than enough to meet Europe’s needs so
far, even accounting for the war in Ukraine.
</p>
<p>
The permitting process will resume once the Department of Energy has
updated its criteria for determining whether new LNG export terminals
are in the “public interest” once their climate impacts are considered.
</p>
<p>
Now, about those climate impacts: It’s true that natural gas burns
“cleaner” than coal, producing about 40% less carbon dioxide (and about
30% less than oil). But natural gas is also largely composed of methane,
“a climate-altering super pollutant,” Jeremy Symons, an environmental
and political analyst and strategist, told Heatmap.
</p>
<p>
While methane breaks down more quickly in the atmosphere than CO2, it
also traps more heat — about 80 times more heat over the course of 20
years. The process of liquifying natural gas not only requires
additional energy, it also introduces new opportunities for methane to
leak, adding to the fuel’s climate impacts. Once all those leaks have
been quantified, argues Cornell University researcher Robert Howarth,
LNG is not only not beneficial to the environment, it’s actually worse
than other fossil fuels. Howarth’s paper has not yet been peer-reviewed,
and some have questioned his conclusions in the past. But there’s no
question that building new LNG facilities will lock the U.S. into
producing planet-warming fuel for years to come.
</p>
<p>
LNG certainly isn’t “good for the environment” of the people who live
near fracking sites and export terminals, either, where health issues
are rampant. In addition to methane, LNG plants release volatile organic
compounds, which have been linked to higher instances of cancer, asthma,
and birth defects.

<p>
<strong>Fact check: </strong>Trump made these remarks after winning the
New Hampshire primary — and <strong>t</strong><strong>hey’re
wrong</strong>. For one thing, while energy <em>is</em> expensive in the
Granite State, New Hampshire’s Department of Energy says its energy
costs are
<a href="https://www.energy.nh.gov/energy-information/energy-new-hampshire" target="_blank">the
fifth-highest</a> in the lower 48.
</p>
<p>
There’s an even bigger fallacy in Trump’s statement, though: that
drilling can quickly lower energy prices. For one thing, oil from new
leases
<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/5-reasons-why-the-united-states-cant-drill-its-way-to-energy-independence/" target="_blank">doesn’t
hit the market</a> for at least four years, according to the Government
Accountability Office. (Offshore drilling takes even longer since
building the rigs alone can take two to three years.) As
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/19/1086925726/gas-prices-oil-crude-drilling" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NPR
explains</a>, there are also operational limits; drilling new wells is
“not as simple as turning a spigot and watching oil gush out.”
</p>
<p>
Much to the dismay of environmentalists, the Biden administration has
also been <a href="#drill">keeping pace</a> with Trump’s historic
drilling. In fact, as of 2024, the U.S. is producing more domestic crude
than
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=MCRFPUS2&f=M" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at
any point during Trump’s presidency</a>.
</p>
<p>
But even with all this new domestic crude, the U.S. is still susceptible
to fluctuations in the global price of oil. That’s partially because the
U.S. imports a different kind of oil than it exports — what those in the
trade call light, sweet crude, compared to the gunkier, heavy crude most
U.S. refineries are set up for. Reconfiguring refineries to handle the
light crude oil “could underserve some product markets and idle (or even
strand) the hundreds of billions of dollars invested in refinery
conversion capacity,” the American Petroleum Institute
<a href="https://www.api.org/news-policy-and-issues/blog/2018/06/14/why-the-us-must-import-and-export-oil" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warns</a>.
Plus, it would also take even more time.
</p>
<p>
All that means that the U.S. is stuck relying on importing and exporting
oil <em>even if </em>domestic production ramps up even more than it
already has. And that, in turn, means we’re at the mercy of fluctuations
in global energy costs, which remain out of the White House’s singular
control.
</p>
<p>
One more thing to note: “The oil industry can decide to produce more oil
whenever it wants,” the Center for American Progress, a liberal public
policy think tank,
<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/5-reasons-why-the-united-states-cant-drill-its-way-to-energy-independence/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explains</a>,
noting that the oil industry is sitting on

than 9,000</a> approved — but unused — drilling permits on federal
lands.” This is the base of
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/oil-companies-record-profits-2022-exxon-chevron/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
criticism</a> that the oil industry is raking in “unprecedented profits”

<p>
<strong>Fact check:</strong> As someone who lives in a New York City
apartment, I would absolutely describe my dishwasher as “precious and
dear,” so that part is true. It is also true that,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/dishwashers-biden-conservatives-culture-war" target="_self">as
I explained last year</a>, rules proposed by the Biden administration
call for new dishwashers imported and made in the U.S. to use 34% less
water, or no more than 3.3 gallons, during their default cycles by 2027.
But <strong>it is not true that those dishwashers don’t work</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Energy-efficient dishwashers <em>can </em>take a long time to clean your
dishes; many cycles last more than two hours and some up to three. The
reason for this is pretty straightforward: In order to achieve the same
level of cleanliness as old, water- and energy-inefficient dishwashers,
new water- and energy-efficient dishwashers
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyOHcNcovYA&ab_channel=ApplianceVideo.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">need
to swish around longer</a>.
</p>
<p>
But the “default cycles” are the <em>only</em> dishwasher mode the

take less time, are still allowed on dishwashers sold in the U.S. and

<strong>Fact check: It’s really gas furnace systems that are,
technically speaking, dated.</strong> Gas furnaces were considered
<a href="https://cycleairfilters.com/blogs/all-about-hvac/history-of-the-forced-air-gas-furnace#:~:text=In%20the%201920s%20and%201930s,for%20their%20efficiency%20and%20reliability." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state-of-the-art</a>
in the 1920s and 1930s, while heat pump technology — which works by
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQaycSD5GWE&ab_channel=BCHydro" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">transferring</a>,
rather than generating, heat from indoors to outdoors and vice versa —
<a href="https://texascooppower.com/heat-pumps-are-back-and-worth-a-look/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">took
off in the 1970s</a> as a response to surging oil prices. Heat pumps can
be up to five times more efficient than fossil-fuel furnaces, according
to electrification advocacy group Rewiring America, which means that at
least 70% of people could save money on their energy bills by switching
from fossil fuel heaters, the group estimates.
</p>
<p>
The cost of a heat pump itself
<a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/reviews/hvac/heat-pump-cost" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">varies
widely</a> depending on size (how much house it has to heat), type
(geothermal vs. air source), and efficiency, then when you add in
factors like the cost to refit you existing HVAC system and the cost of
labor, well,
<a href="https://www.blocpower.io/posts/heat-pump-installation-cost-2023-prices-guide" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it
adds up</a>. While heat pumps aren’t cheap, they do at least serve as
both a furnace <em>and</em> an air conditioner, two appliances for the
price of one, an investment that can pay back over time, Rewiring
America said.

a 2013 regulation about how much water can flow out of a showerhead.
“Manufacturers [had not demanded] the rollback,”

showers came from Trump himself, who complained that the conservation
standards led to low water pressure and a dissatisfying shower
experience.” With four or five or more nozzles, as Trump had allowed,
“you could have 10, 15 gallons per minute powering out of the
showerhead, literally probably washing you out of the bathroom,” Andrew

<p>
You
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change-wind-solar-electric-vehicles-energy" target="_self">won’t
hear me say this often</a>, but Donald Trump kind of sort of has a
point.
</p>
<p>
On Monday, the former president and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self">presumed
Republican nominee</a> rebutted headlines that claimed he’d predicted a
“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/16/us/politics/trump-speech-ohio.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">‘bloodbath’
if he loses</a>” the November election. To be sure, “bloodbath” isn’t a
word you want to throw around when you’re
<a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/02/supreme-court-donald-trump-trial-january-6.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accused
of</a> architecting the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. One could probably even
make the
<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/evaaym/is-trump-really-playing-3d-chess-we-asked-the-masters" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">three-dimensional
chess</a> case that Trump <em>intentionally</em> used the word to
trigger coverage of his comments.
</p>
<p>
Whatever the case may be, he posted Monday on
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/us/politics/trump-blood-bath-auto-industry.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Truth
Social</a> that the Fake News Media “pretended to be shocked at my use
of the word BLOODBATH even though they fully understood that I was
simply referring to” — that is, electric vehicles from China.
</p>
<p>
Trump’s full comment came during a rally in Dayton, Ohio, over the
weekend and
<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-rally-in-ohio" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">read
as follows</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
To China, if you’re listening — President Xi, you and I are friends, but
he understands the way I deal. Those big monster car manufacturing
plants that you are building in Mexico right now, and you think you are
going to get that, not hire Americans, and you’re going to sell the car
to us — no. We are going to put a 100% tariff on every single car that
comes across the lot and you’re not going to be able to sell those cars
if I get elected. Now, if I don’t get elected, it’s going to be a
bloodbath for the whole — that’s going to be the least of it. It’s going
to be a bloodbath for the country. That’ll be the least of it. But
they’re not going to sell those cars.
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>Aaaand</em> here’s where my defense of Trump runs out. While he’s
correct about some in the media taking his “bloodbath” remark out of
context, “there actually are no operating Chinese-owned EV factories in
Mexico,” Ilaria Mazzocco, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies and an expert on Chinese climate policy, told
me.
</p>
<p>
Trump’s remarks are “not particularly surprising,” though, “in the sense
that this topic has become politicized very rapidly,” Mazzocco added.
Fear is growing in
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ford-gm-stellantis-byd" target="_self">Detroit</a>
and in
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/chinese-ev-cars-biden" target="_self">Washington,
D.C.</a> that inexpensive Chinese-branded EVs could make their way to
the U.S. from
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/02/27/byd-no-plans-sell-evs-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">yet-to-be-built
plants</a> in Mexico, hurting American automakers whose EVs can’t
compete at that lower price point yet. As Robinson Meyer
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/chinese-ev-cars-biden" target="_self">wrote
for Heatmap</a>, the booming Chinese automaker BYD “recently advertised
an
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/663595/byd-seagull-ev-priced-11400-usd-gets-10000-orders-first-day/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$11,000
plug-in hybrid</a> targeted at the Chinese market … Even doubling its
price with tariffs would keep it firmly among [the United States’] most
affordable new vehicles.”
</p>
<p>
Mazzocco said this isn’t wholly a bad thing — “there’s a point of value
to competition that we shouldn’t forget.” The threat of cheap Chinese
EVs has already driven American
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-18/chinese-ev-affordability-frightens-ford-gm-us-automakers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">automakers
including Ford</a> to reassess their
<a href="https://heatmap.news/cheap-evs-gm-bolt-volvo-ex30" target="_self">electric
lineups</a>. That’s a plus since Ford’s smaller and more affordable cars
would not only
<a href="https://heatmap.news/cheap-evs-gm-bolt-volvo-ex30" target="_self">fill
a gap in the U.S. EV market</a>, they’d also address the fact that
electric vehicles need to get “cheaper everywhere … if we are to fight
climate change,” Meyer has pointed out.
</p>
<p>
But! It’s also an election year. “EVs have encapsulated everybody’s
fears of competition with China,” Mazzocco reminded me. It’s been a
particularly rude awakening to realize that Beijing is “actually better
at something than the Americans are.” In the face of this reality, both
Biden and Trump have been fighting to look tougher than the other on
China, especially in big auto states like Michigan, where Trump has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-ev-charging" target="_self">likewise
slammed EVs at his rallies</a>, and Ohio, which could potentially decide
control of the White House.
</p>
<p>
Biden has already ordered the Commerce Department to investigate the
potential national security threat of Chinese-made EVs, which currently
make up only about 2% of EV imports to the U.S. in the form of Polestar,
the
<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/09/01/china-electric-car-vehicle-polestar-ev-us-economy-climate-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first
Chinese-owned</a> EV company to make moves in the U.S. last year, but
<a href="https://jalopnik.com/volvo-is-done-propping-up-struggling-polestar-1851215514" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hardly
one that’s thriving</a>.
</p>
<p>
The truth is, there’s plenty to debate regarding what America and its
automakers should do about the rise of Chinese EVs. When doing so,
however — <em>ahem</em>, Mr. Former President — it’s always better to
have your facts straight.

<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I love books. I love reading books but I also love books as objects. And if you’re a designer—or passionate about design—chances are, you also love books. There’s something about the book, as an object, that managed to survive across all the various societal and technological changes.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
In the 2010s, during the peak iPad era, people thought paper books were
doomed. What’s the point of printing something when you can get
hundreds, or even thousands of books inside a single device? And I’ll be
honest with you, I went through that phase myself. For years I was only
reading on an iPad. And it was great. Until it wasn’t.
</p>
<p>
There’s something about a printed book that technology can’t replace. I
can’t tell you exactly why but I’m sure you know what I’m talking about.
Reading a book, handling a book, smelling the ink and the paper, seeing
it age over time, those are things that can’t be reproduced in the
digital space.
</p>
<p>
I love books. I love when people pour their hearts and souls into
creating great books. And I’m not just talking about the writing. Or the
photographing. Or the illustrating. I’m talking about caring about the
book itself, as an object.
</p>
<p>
That’s one of the reasons why I keep buying every book
<a href="https://shop.specialprojects.jp">Craig Mod makes</a>. The man
knows how to make great books. And you can feel it. You can instantly
tell he loved the process as soon as you pick up one of his books.
</p>
<p>
I never had to make a book myself. I designed a few, back when I was
studying graphic design more than a decade ago. But I did experience
firsthand what it means to care about creating a great book. That’s
because I watched Carl and my brother working together to create the
first volume of the
<a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/selection-architecture">Minimalissimo
Selection</a> series. The final product is an incredibly simple object
but creating simple objects is painfully hard.

</div>
<figcaption>
If you’re into minimalism and architecture this is a book for you
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Before websites like Minimalissimo were a thing, you had to buy books to
find visual inspiration. And now you have books created as a result of
years of curation of those same websites. From ink, to pixel, and back
to ink.
</p>
<p>
The iPad didn’t manage to kill books the same way smartphones didn’t
manage to kill traditional photography. The more we digitize the world
the more analogue, physical objects become important. And as creators,
it’s important to care about creating quality objects. Because as they
say if is worth doing at all, is worth doing well.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
A final note about the lovely book Carl made. It was a limited run and
there won’t be a second edition. But,
<a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/selection-architecture">there
are still copies left so if you want one I suggest you act fast</a>.
Carl was also kind enough to set up a 25% discount for the readers of
this site. Just use the <code>SELECTION25</code> code at checkout.
</p>
<p>
Also, if you love books, and coffee, and great filmmaking, Antonio
Carusone created an amazing promotional video for the book that I’ll
embed down below.

id="ex-trump-aide-navarro-reports-to-prison-to-serve-contempt-sentence">Ex-Trump
Aide Navarro Reports to Prison to Serve Contempt Sentence</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MIAMI, FLORIDA — Peter Navarro, Donald Trump’s former White House
trade advisor, reported to a Florida prison on Tuesday to begin serving
a four-month sentence for contempt of Congress.</p>
<p>Navarro, 74, is the highest-ranking former member of the Trump
administration to spend time behind bars for actions stemming from the
former Republican president’s efforts to overturn the results of the
2020 election.</p>
<p>Navarro was found guilty of two counts of contempt in September for
refusing to comply with a subpoena to testify before the congressional
panel that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol
by Trump supporters.</p>
<p>Navarro, a Harvard-educated economist, had asked the U.S. Supreme
Court to allow him to remain free while appealing his conviction, but
Chief Justice John Roberts rejected his last-ditch request on
Monday.</p>
<p>Navarro, the architect of the “Green Bay Sweep,” a plot to block
Congress from certifying the 2020 election results, will serve his
sentence at a minimum-security federal prison in Miami.</p>
<p>He spoke to reporters in a parking lot before turning himself in.</p>
<p>“I am the first senior White House advisor in the history of our
republic that has ever been charged with this alleged crime,” Navarro
said. “When I walk in that prison today, the justice system, such as it
is, will have done a crippling blow to the constitutional separation of
powers and executive privilege.”</p>
<p>He claimed to be a victim of “partisan weaponization of our justice
system.”</p>
<p>“Every person who has taken me on this road to that prison is a
friggin’ Democrat and a Trump hater,” Navarro said, adding that he will
“walk proudly in there and do my time.”</p>
<p>“I will gather strength from this: Donald John Trump is the nominee
for the Republican presidential campaign,” he said.</p>
<p>Navarro refused to appear for a deposition before the House of
Representatives committee that investigated the January 6 attack on
Congress and declined to supply documents to the panel.</p>
<p>He was convicted of contempt by a federal jury in Washington after a
two-day trial.</p>
<p>Navarro is the second close Trump ally to be convicted of contempt of
Congress for defying subpoenas from the House committee.</p>
<p>Steve Bannon, one of the masterminds behind Trump’s 2016 presidential
campaign, was also found guilty of contempt of Congress.</p>
<p>Bannon was sentenced to four months in prison in January but remains
free pending an appeal.</p>
<p>Trump was scheduled to go on trial in Washington on March 4 on
charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the election won by
Democrat Joe Biden.</p>
<p>His trial has been put on hold, however, until the Supreme Court
hears Trump’s claim that as a former president, he is immune from
criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has scheduled arguments in the immunity case for
April 25.</p>
<p>Trump, 77, was impeached for a second time by the House after the
Capitol riot — he was charged with inciting an insurrection — but was
acquitted by the Senate.</p>

Moving to 24/7 Clean Electricity Is Going to Be Really, Really Hard</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTcyMDEyMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MTgxNDUzNX0.X3ZUgpThQ9EUcxaEmb563b05SQE7C84yclKfZNsRSZQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Today, if a company claims to run on “100% clean power,” that generally
means it’s adding up its electricity use for the entire year, then
offsetting any fossil fuel-generated electricity through the purchase of
renewable energy certificates, a.k.a. RECs. So a New York-based firm
using natural gas to power its data center at night can offset that
dirty power by purchasing RECs generated by a California-based solar
farm in the middle of the day, so long as energy production and
procurement happen within the same year.
</p>
<p>
We call this system “annual matching,” and it may not be much longer for
this world.
</p>
<p>
The U.S. Treasury Department
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_blank">announced
in December</a> that, to qualify for the most generous subsidies under
the Inflation Reduction Act’s hydrogen production tax credit, clean
hydrogen must be produced using a relatively new source of carbon-free
electricity generated within the <em>same hour</em> it’s used and in
roughly the same location. The hourly matching requirement, which will
take effect in 2028, could compel utilities, grid operators, energy
producers and consumers to adopt new systems for clean energy
accounting, ultimately laying the groundwork for a 24/7 clean
electricity market that extends far beyond the hydrogen sector.
</p>
<p>
Energy system experts generally hailed the move, and not just because
without it, electricity-hungry hydrogen production could potentially do
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/hydrogen-additionality-climate" target="_self">more
harm</a> to the climate than good. Annual matching, also, is no longer
serving its original purpose of incentivizing the buildout of new
renewables. When wind and solar were more expensive than fossil fuels,
developers could make up the cost difference by selling annually-matched
RECs. But today, wind and solar are often the cheapest energy options
available.
</p>
<p>
That’s not to say everyone was in favor of hourly matching, however.

Democrats</a> say that moving to hourly matching in the next four years
could not only prove too logistically challenging, but also lead to
infeasibly high costs for clean hydrogen that will
<a href="https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/why-45v-may-knock-one-green-hydrogen-project-off-the-map" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hamper
the growth</a> of the emerging industry. More than a year of furious
lobbying, public commenting, and punditry over the future of America’s
nascent hydrogen industry
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-treasury" target="_self">hinges</a>
on this question: Can we pull off verifiable 24/7 clean energy?
</p>
<p>
There’s an emerging ecosystem of companies trying to help do just that.
Granular Energy is a European startup creating software to help
utilities and power suppliers move toward 24/7 energy matching by
telling them where and when clean energy is most needed. “When you get
down to the hourly level,” Natalie Valentin, Granular’s commercial lead
for North America, told me, “it can help drive investment in the types
of technologies — whether it’s battery storage, clean firm generation,
or renewable generation.”
</p>
<p>
Utilities and power suppliers generally have hourly generation data on
hand, Valentin said. It’s just that the energy attribution certificates
they receive from
<a href="https://www.leveltenenergy.com/post/intro-renewable-energy-certificates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tracking
systems and registries</a> for renewable energy credits don’t usually
include this information. “This data is very readily available,” she
told me. “What we’re helping to do is put it into a tool that creates
transparency, it streamlines the operations, it has that audit trail
that’s preventing any double counting.”
</p>
<p>
Granular links the information from energy certificates with the utility
or power provider’s internal metering data to provide an hour-by-hour
snapshot of the supplier’s energy mix. That then gives energy suppliers
the ability to offer hourly-matched green power programs to their
customers.
</p>
<p>
All of this would be simpler if electricity customers had insight into
their hourly electricity usage in the first place, or if the tracking
systems provided suppliers with time-matched certificates upfront. But
as it stands, most customers
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/247-hourly-matching-electricity#:~:text=could%20participate%20in.-,What%20Are%20Some%20of%20the%20Barriers%20to%20Purchasing%20Electricity%20Generated%20to%20Match%20Hourly%20Electricity%20Use%3F,-Because%20buying%20and" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">don’t
have meters</a> that provide this level of detail, making it difficult
for them to understand where their energy is coming from. And out of the
nation’s
<a href="https://resource-solutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Tracking-System-Map.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">10
renewable energy credit</a> tracking systems and registries, seven don’t
report hourly information.
</p>
<p>
The three that do include the nation’s largest grid operator,
<a href="https://insidelines.pjm.com/pjm-eis-to-produce-energy-certificates-hourly/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PJM</a>,
the nonprofit
<a href="https://www.mrets.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Midwest
Renewable Energy Tracking System</a>, and the North American Renewables
Registry. Seattle-based LevelTen Energy is aggregating the data from
these three entities to create a new marketplace for buying, selling,
and managing hourly-matched energy certificates, to be launched later
this year in regions where hourly tracking exists. The platform is
called the
<a href="https://www.leveltenenergy.com/alliance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Granular
Certificate Trading Alliance</a> (unrelated to Granular Energy, though
the company is a supporter of the initiative), and LevelTen is building
it in partnership with the Intercontinental Exchange, a tech company
that operates global financial exchanges.
<a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/microsoft-google-others-partner-with-levelten-to-create-first-marketplace-for-24-7-clean-energy/#:~:text=LATEST%20NEWS-,Microsoft%2C%20Google%2C%20others%20partner%20with%20LevelTen%20Energy%20to%20create%20first,for%2024%2F7%20clean%20energy&text=A%20growing%20number%20of%20organizations,energy%20to%20power%20their%20operations." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google
and Microsoft</a> are also partners; each has announced plans to move to
hourly matching by 2030.
</p>
<p>
“We’re looking to provide an end-to-end experience so people can
indicate, here’s where we have demand,” explained Katie Soroye, a
LevelTen executive. Crucially, the platform will also ensure that hourly
matching certificates are retired once they’re purchased to prevent
double-counting.
</p>
<p>
The hope is that the seven tracking systems that lack hourly matching
capabilities will soon be either persuaded or mandated to develop them,
leading to a country-wide granular certificate marketplace — something
the clean hydrogen tax rules were designed to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_self">help
expedite</a>. Once the mandate is finalized, the
<a href="https://resource-solutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Readiness-for-Hourly-U.S.-Renewable-Energy-Tracking-Systems.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Center
for Resource Solutions found</a>, most of the tracking systems could
phase in hourly matching within two years.
</p>
<p>
That doesn’t mean they’re eager to make the change, with many citing
cost, low demand, and in some cases lack of data availability and
confusion over how to handle a more complex dataset as top concerns with
hourly matching. Cost is also a major concern for the hydrogen industry
overall.
</p>
<p>
“To the extent that 24/7 works, it has to increase hydrogen prices,”
said Aaron Bergman, a fellow at the nonprofit research group Resources
for the Future, although he acknowledged that hourly matching is also
likely to reduce emissions. “Now, I think what’s challenging is, is that
going to be enough to interfere with the ability to really start
building out green hydrogen?”
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://cleanpower.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ACP_Green_Hydrogen_Deployment_Brief.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The
American Clean Power Association</a> thinks so. Its members estimate “a
20-150% price premium for hourly matched hydrogen production” because
electrolyzers, the devices used to make clean hydrogen, will only be
able to operate when clean electricity is available. The trade group
recommends waiting until 2032 to implement hourly matching, saying this
will give the market more time to mature and lower prices through
economies of scale.
</p>
<p>
The whole industry is hardly aligned on this question. Seven companies,
including the world’s largest hydrogen producer, filed a
<a href="https://hystorenergy.com/hydrogen-industry-support-of-strong-45v-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">joint
letter</a> with Treasury officials before the draft rules were released
urging them to require 24/7 hourly matching by 2028. “Hourly matching
will catalyze cutting-edge, flexible electrolyzer technologies and
establish a flourishing and world-leading domestic U.S. advanced
electrolyzer manufacturing base,” the letter said.
</p>
<p>
The rule-making process will continue with a public hearing scheduled
for
<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/03/04/2024-04304/section-45v-credit-for-production-of-clean-hydrogen-section-48a15-election-to-treat-clean-hydrogen" target="_blank">later
this month</a>. But assuming the hourly-matching requirement stays, it
will certainly add momentum to what’s become a movement for 24/7 clean
electricity. Even the U.S. federal government has
<a href="https://www.fedcenter.gov/programs/eo14057/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">committed</a>
to sourcing 100% of their facility’s electricity from carbon-free
sources, half of which will be hourly matched by 2030.
</p>
<p>
“Time is ticking,” said Bergman. “It’s really standing up something that
is relatively new in a relatively short period of time.” Some degree of
delays and logistical roadblocks may prove inevitable. But, he said, “it
certainly can be done.”

<p>You know those modal screens that interrupt your groove when you are
surfing? There are no laws forcing websites to use them. They use them
because they choose to. ↫ Bite code! Cookie banners are not only not
required, they’re not even needed, and most implementations you
encounter today are illegal anyway. You can use session cookies and
anonymous stats cookies without needing any user approval. Companies
like to use these cookie banners because they want to make you mad at
the law, not at them for tracking you up the wazzoo, and people who
actually do know better trot out the cookie banners to enrage you at the
government instead of at the corporations exploiting you. EU law only
states that if a website wants to track you, they have to let you know.
That’s it. Seems very reasonable to anyone who isn’t a corporatist.</p>

Thankfully, pig butchering scams are getting attention. Three weeks
after I posted
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/02/tracing-pig-butchers.html"><i>Tracing
The Pig Butchers</i></a>, John M. Griffin and Kevin Mei posted
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235"><i>How
Do Crypto Flows Finance Slavery? The Economics of Pig
Butchering</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Through blockchain addresses used by ‘‘pig butchering’’ victims, we
trace crypto flows and uncover methods commonly used by scammers to
obfuscate their activities, including multiple transactions, swapping
between cryptocurrencies through DeFi smart contracts, and bridging
across blockchains. The perpetrators interact freely with major crypto
exchanges, sending over 104,000 small potential inducement payments to
build trust with victims. Funds exit the crypto network in large
quantities, mostly in Tether, through less transparent but large
exchanges—Binance, Huobi, and OKX. These criminal enterprises pay
approximately 87 basis points in transaction fees and appear to have
recently moved at least $75.3 billion into suspicious exchange deposit
accounts, including $15.2 billion from exchanges commonly used by U.S.
investors. Our findings highlight how the ‘‘reputable’’ crypto industry
provides the common gateways and exit points for massive amounts of
criminal capital flows. We hope these findings will help shed light on
and ultimately stop these heinous crimes.

Their Figure 9 shows the flow of funds over time into the
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">scammer’s
wallets at exchanges</a>. This is how they estimated the $75.3B; their
extremely conservative estimate is $35.1B, and their liberal estimate is
$237.6B. Note the huge ~$45B increase from January 2021 to January 2023,
partly driven by the cryptocurrency boom, and the slowing until January
2024. Presumably the ETF pump will accelerate the rate.<br /> <br />
Below the fold, some commentary on this and other recent
developments.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> Note that
these numbers are <i>flows</i> not the total revenue for the scammers,
there is some double-counting involved as scammers move funds between
their accounts at these exchanges. The $15.2B is likely much closer to
revenue, because the scammers generally don’t want to move significant
sums <i>into</i> Western exchanges.<br /> <br /> Griffin and Wei start
their tracing from a collection of the wallet addresses which the
scammers used to
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">receive
funds from victims</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
We start with 3,256 Ethereum addresses, 770 Bitcoin addresses, and 702
Tron addresses. Most addresses are used ten or more times, and 28% of
addresses are used more than one hundred times. Of these initial sets,
Ethereum addresses receive $5.8 billion in funds, compared to $389
million for Tron and $373 million for Bitcoin. Given that the Ethereum
addresses represent approximately 88% of the total funds, we begin by
examining Ether (ETH, the native cryptocurrency on Ethereum) and token
(commonly known as ERC-20 tokens) transactions on the Ethereum
blockchain.
</blockquote>
<br /> They then follow the way the scammers try to
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">obscure
their activites</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
We trace victim funds in bulk and follow their paths to centralized
exchange deposit addresses from January 2020 to February 2024. Figure 1
plots the resulting network for a three percent sample of nodes from the
traced network and highlights many features.
</blockquote>
This reveals four main points:<br />
<ul>
<li>
The
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">sources
of the funds</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
First, the figure shows how crypto often originates from large exchanges
where investors commonly have accounts (Coinbase, Crypto.com, and
Binance) and flows into the network.
</blockquote>
The victims need to convert fiat into cryptocurrency using well-known,
trusted exchanges.
</li>
<li>
Where the scammers
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">move
the funds next</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Second, funds are often swapped for Tether (known as USDT) through
Tokenlon.
</blockquote>
Tokenlon is not a mixer, similar to
<a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/tornado-hit-by-the-department-of-justice">Tornado
Cash</a>, but “a relatively obscure decentralized exchange”. The
scammers’ goal is partly to obscure their tracks but also to avoid the
volatility of cryptocurrencies by converting to stablecoins at the first
opportunity.
</li>
<li>
The scammers need to
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">find
an off-ramp to fiat</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Third, after circulating through various hops in the network, crypto
exits the system through centralized exchange deposit addresses.
</blockquote>
Even stablecoins won’t by the Lambo, so the scammers have to get their
loot to somewhere that can convert it to fiat.
</li>
<li>
Which exchanges are
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">useful
off-ramps</a>?<br />
<blockquote>
Fourth, transactions in amounts above $100,000 and in particular $1
million commonly transfer funds to deposit addresses on Binance, Huobi,
and OKX.
</blockquote>
Obviously, they are the offshore exchanges that lack effective KYC/AML,
and in particular the one that
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-21/binance-ceo-zhao-to-plead-guilty-in-us-settlement-wsj">pled
guilty</a>.
</li>
</ul>
Note that this research contrasts with the tracing efforts I discussed
in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/02/tracing-pig-butchers.html"><i>Tracing
The Pig Butchers</i></a>, which traced flows starting from a few victim
reports. This research both starts from a much larger collection of
victim reported addresses, and uses network analysis techniques to
identify a much larger set of scammer wallet addresses. Thus it is
understandable that
<a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-53/">Molly White is
skeptical</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
But the $75 billion number was certainly a surprise, and it’s hit
mainstream outlets including
<a href="https://time.com/6836703/pig-butchering-scam-victim-loss-money-study-crypto/"><i>Time</i></a>.
I have to say I have some doubts about the number, particularly given
other estimates have been in the low billions, but regardless, it’s
clear that the pig butchering issue in crypto is a multi-billion dollar
problem.
</blockquote>
But there are good reasons why Griffin and Wei would come up with much
larger numbers for <i>revenue</i> than earlier tracing efforts; they are
looking at a much larger fraction of the total scammer network. Zeke
Faux’s article in
<a href="https://time.com/6836703/pig-butchering-scam-victim-loss-money-study-crypto/"><i>Time</i></a>
starts:<br />
<blockquote>
Pig-butchering scammers have likely stolen more than $75 billion from
victims around the world, far more than previously estimated, according
to a new study.
</blockquote>
That is not what the paper says.
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">It
says they</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
recently moved at least $75.3 billion into suspicious exchange deposit
accounts
</blockquote>
The paper points out that the $75.3B in <i>flows</i> includes some
amount of
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">double-counting</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
If a network sent funds from say OKX to Binance, it would lead to the
double-counting of funds. Additionally, the funds may be due to other
activities of the criminal networks. … We examine the sources of funds
that later enter into these potential scammer deposit addresses and find
that $40.2 billion of the $75.3 billion can be attributed to exchanges.
</blockquote>
It is unlikely that all this movement from one exchange to another is
between scammer accounts, so $35.1B is a conservative estimate.<br />
<br /> The scammers do send small amounts to
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">exchange
deposit wallets</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Across all exchanges, the scammer network initiated 104,460 deposits to
centralized exchanges for amounts below $10,000, most commonly in small
amounts clustering at round numbers, such as $100, $200 or $500. The
transaction patterns mirror the characteristics of inducement payments
in pig butchering scams, which are small payments from scammers to
victims used to build trust. … We find 83% of potential inducement
payments are sent from addresses used in more than ten transactions,
suggesting limited monitoring by crypto exchanges.
</blockquote>
There is a reason for “limited monitoring by crypto exchanges”. The 87
basis points the authors find on movements of $75.3B is $655M in fees
over 4 years, enough to motivate turning a blind eye.<br /> <br />

The left and right nodes are scammer wallets. The right node is a
“collection node” that converts victim payments to Tether and aggregates
them for onward transmission in larger amounts.<br /> <br /> Their next
step was to find other flows into the collection node, as shown in
Figure 2b. Even this one step into the network produces a large number
of scammer wallet addresses, the addresses to which other victims were
directed to send funds. By identifying these wallets the authors
generate a huge number of additional “victim reports”.<br /> <br />

Tracing the flows out of the collection nodes produces an enormous
number of other scammer wallets, shown in Figure 2c, as the funds are
shuffled around to obfuscate the flows.<br /> <br /> The off-ramps are
at exchanges, so the authors need to find the
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">scammers
deposit addresses</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Since scammers are unlikely to return large sums of stolen funds, we
consider deposit addresses that receive more than $100,000 as more
likely to be scammer deposit addresses. These addresses are rarely
associated with Western exchanges, but are common within Binance, Huobi,
and OKX, as well as exchanges such as Kucoin, Bitkub, and MXC. The
common feature of these exchanges is that they have loose KYC procedures
and are perceived to be outside of U.S. jurisdiction. To more fully
understand the scope of the network, we apply “deposit address
clustering” by tracking addresses that send funds into these deposit
addresses and finding other recipient deposit addresses associated with
the same user. To avoid capturing payments made by criminals for things
like inducement payments, we exclude all connections below $100,000 and
only consider direct connections.
</blockquote>
This is where the $75.3B number comes from; it is the total inflow into
deposit addresses at offshore exchanges believed to be controlled by
scammers. Note again the potential for double-counting if scammers move
funds between these exchanges. Deposit address clustering was published
by Friedhelm Victor in
<a href="https://fc20.ifca.ai/preproceedings/31.pdf"><i>Address
clustering heuristics for Ethereum</i></a> (Section 5.1):<br />
<blockquote>
To credit the assets to the correct account, exchanges typically create
so-called deposit addresses, which will then forward received funds to a
main address. As these deposit addresses are created per customer,
multiple addresses that send funds to the same deposit address are
highly likely to be controlled by the same entity. … The forwarded
amount is often slightly less than what was received, as the exchange
has to pay for the transaction costs. In most cases, deposit addresses
are EOAs [Externally Owned Accounts], but they can also be smart
contracts. When depositing tokens on the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken
for example, users are instructed to send them to a given smart contract
address, identical versions of which have been mass deployed in advance.
This makes it trivial to identify all identical token deposit contracts
deployed by Kraken. They are designed to forward received tokens
automatically, thereby passing on the transaction costs to the user.

Victor’s Figure 1 shows how this works. Wallets 0x2 and 0x3 deposit to
the same deposit address at exchange A, so they have the same account at
exchange A. Wallet 0x4 shares an account with 0x3 at exchange B, so all
three are the same entity.<br /> <br /> By analyzing the network graph
they discover using these techniques, Griffin and Wei draw the following
conclusions about
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">money
laundering</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Scammers extensively recirculate and swap funds across different
addresses and cryptocurrencies. These transactions incur costs, but may
help obfuscate the true source of their funds. We estimate that
transaction costs for a network of this scale total to 87 basis points
as a portion of outflows to exchange deposit addresses. In contrast,
Soudijn and Reuter (2016) find costs of 7-16% to move physical Euro
bills from Europe to Columbia and money laundering commission estimates
range from 4-12% (US Treasury Department, 2002) and 10-20% (US Treasury
Department, 2007). Cryptocurrencies thus appear to be a much more
cost-effective channel for moving illicit funds across borders. In
total, scammer swap transactions may constitute more than 58% of
Tokenlon transactions since 2022. We observe large inflows from
potentially Chinese victims in 2020; however, after the Chinese
financial authorities banned cryptocurrency trading in late 2021, there
appears to be a dramatic decrease in Chinese victims and a shift to
US-based victims. Overall, in the set of addresses touched by the
criminals, we find $1.172 trillion dollars of volume, 84% of which is in
Tether.
</blockquote>
Griffin and Wei
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">conclude</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This project highlights how large-scale tracing of tainted funds can
help expose and understand criminal financial activity that can
hopefully be used as a roadmap in other criminal contexts. There are
several other practical implications of our study. First, organized or
“legitimate” crypto exchanges serve as the on- and off-ramps for
billions of dollars in criminal proceeds. Users with a crypto exchange
account should realize that crypto exchange users are frequent targets
of scams, and their funds are just a quick transfer away from being
irreversibly lost—a risk that is far less prevalent for traditional
investment accounts. Second, our findings indicate that the large
players in the crypto space are likely not sufficiently protecting their
customers from scams. Third, the Ethereum network appears to drastically
reduce barriers for illicit financial flows of transnational organized
crime. Fourth, romance scammers prefer the stablecoin Tether over other
cryptocurrencies and the Ethereum network over Bitcoin. Fifth,
decentralized exchanges also serve as large swapping points to exchange
crypto and obfuscate funds. Crypto hedge funds and users (many based in
the U.S. and Europe) who might purport to engage in “arbitrage” or
“liquidity trading” (PWC, 2023) may simply be making profits by
facilitating low-cost money laundering. Finally, the large centralized
crypto exchanges located in jurisdictions with opaque regulatory
environments (Binance, Huobi, OKX, and others) seem to be preferential
potential exit points that can further finance extremely large amounts
of criminal activities. Such activity has continued as of February 16,
2024, despite recent crackdowns.

false and misleading. “With Tether, every action is online, every action
is traceable, every asset can be seized and every criminal can be
caught,” Ardoino said in a statement. “We work with law enforcement to
do exactly that.”<br /> <br /> Tether has cooperated with authorities in
some cases to freeze accounts tied to fraud. But often by the time the
crime is reported, the scammers have already cashed out.
</blockquote>
This is more obfuscation from Tether. The paper clearly demonstrates
that the scammers rapidly convert their takings to stablecoins,
overwhelmingly Tether, and that they are able to use offshore exchanges
as their off-ramps.

<h2 id="austin-us-free-world-will-not-let-ukraine-fail">Austin: US, Free
World ‘Will Not Let Ukraine Fail’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Ramstein, Germany   — Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin says the
United States remains determined to provide Ukraine with the resources
it needs to fight Russian aggression, even as a U.S. Congress has yet to
approve new funding for Ukraine.</p>
<p>“The United States will not let Ukraine fail. This coalition will not
let Ukraine fail, and the free world will not let Ukraine fail,” Austin
said at the start of this month’s Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting
in Germany.</p>
<p>This is Austin’s first international trip since he was hospitalized
on January 1 due to complications from surgery to treat his prostate
cancer in late December. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) brings
together officials from more than 50 nations to coordinate their Ukraine
efforts.</p>
<p>The U.S. has contributed about $44 billion in security assistance to
Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in February 2022, with allies and
partners also committing more than $44 billion in that time frame.</p>
<p>But the U.S. military has run out of congressionally approved funds
for replenishing its weapons stockpiles sent to Ukraine, and leadership
in the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives has so far
refused to bring new aid for Ukraine up for a vote.</p>
<p>“There isn’t a way that our allies can really combine forces to make
up for the lack of U.S. support,” according to a senior defense
official, who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity ahead of
the UDCG.</p>
<p>Not only is the U.S. military out of funds for Ukraine, the Defense
Department has a funding shortfall from its efforts to provide military
support to Ukraine that will grow to least $12 billion by the end of the
fiscal year without additional funding from Congress, according to
officials. The Pentagon previously acknowledged a funding shortfall of
about $10 billion for U.S. military weapons needed to replace those
already sent to Ukraine.</p>
<p>In addition to the $10 billion shortage for weapons replenishment,
U.S. Army Europe and Africa currently has overspent its budget by about
$500 million as it continues to pay for the training of Ukrainians and
other Ukraine support mission necessities out of pocket, Col. Martin
O’Donnell, the public affairs director for the Army’s forces across
those two continents, told VOA.</p>
<p>That shortfall will grow to at least $2 billion by the end of the
fiscal year without supplemental funding from Congress, he added.</p>
<p>Ukrainian forces have continued to fight back against Russian forces
in the east while inflicting considerable damage to Russian forces in
the Black Sea and downing Russian warplanes. However, Moscow— with the
help of North Korea and Iran — has drastically ramped up its defense
production capacity, forcing Ukraine to retreat from some battles due to
ammunition shortages, the senior defense official added.</p>
<p>“Ukraine is heavily outgunned on the battlefield. We’ve received
reports of Ukrainian troops rationing or even running out of ammunition
on the front lines,” said the official.</p>
<p>Austin on Tuesday thanked members of the group for digging deeper to
get vital security assistance to Ukraine, praising the Czech Republic
for recently procuring 800,000 artillery shells for Kyiv. He also
highlighted Germany, France, Denmark and Sweden for their new
contributions.</p>
<p>Last week, the United States announced its first new round of
military aid for Ukraine since late December, in what defense officials
called an “ad hoc” package made possible through U.S. Army procurement
savings.</p>
<p>The military assistance package is valued at up to $300 million and
will provide Ukraine with immediate air defense, artillery and anti-tank
capabilities, along with more ammunition for HIMARS rocket launchers and
155-mm artillery rounds. But officials say it is unclear if there will
be future procurement savings to produce another extraordinary package
of aid.</p>
<p>“This is not a sustainable solution for Ukraine. We urgently need
congressional approval of a national security supplemental,” the senior
defense official said.</p>
<p>The emphasis on ammunition and air defense will likely be as strong
as ever during this UDCG meeting. Officials say Ukraine’s forces need
interceptors for a variety of their air defense systems, which they have
been running out of as they try to defend against wave upon wave of
attacks from Russia.</p>
<p>Coalition leadership group</p>
<p>To better organize how the UDCG provides Kyiv with military weapons
and equipment, the group’s members have formed capability coalitions to
identify ways to increase Kyiv’s efficiency and cut costs.</p>
<p>Defense officials say Secretary Austin will convene a meeting of the
leads and co-leads of all the capability coalitions for the first time
on Tuesday during a special coalition leadership group session.</p>
<p>Air Force capability is co-led by the United States, Denmark and the
Netherlands. The armor capability is co-led by Poland and Italy. The
artillery capability is co-led by France and the United States.
De-mining is co-led by Lithuania and Iceland. Drone capability is co-led
by Latvia and the United Kingdom. Information technology is co-led by
Estonia and Luxembourg. Integrated air and missile defense capabilities
are co-led by Germany and France, and maritime security is co-led by the
United Kingdom and Norway.</p>
<p>Critics like Sean McFate, a professor at Syracuse University and
author of “The New Rules of War,” told VOA the international community
is putting its money into expensive military aid that falls short in
modern warfare.</p>
<p>“It’s not conventional warfare that beat back Russia’s blitz. It was
Ukrainian guerrilla warfare,” he said. “Ukraine was winning the
unconventional fight. But then in fall of 2022, they decided to go
conventional against Russia, which was strategically silly.”</p>
<p>McFate added that giving Ukraine more conventional war weapons was,
in his view, “the strategic definition of insanity.”</p>
<p>Instead, he said Ukraine and its allies needed to think about
unconventional ways where they can leverage their power to defeat
Russia, such as guerilla operations and more direct actions deep inside
Russia to build on the Russian population’s unfavorable opinions of the
war.</p>
<p>“Use your conventional forces to hold the line, but don’t invest them
to create an offensive which requires a lot more resources,” McFate told
VOA.</p>
<p>“M1A1 Abram tanks and F-16 fighter jets … will win tactical victories
on the battlefield, but we all know that you can win every battle, yet
lose the war, because wars are won on the strategic level, not at the
tactical level of warfare,” he said.</p>

Sports Illustrated’s buyer is keeping the print magazine around</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Sports Illustrated has a new publisher, which says it will keep
producing the magazine’s print editions. We’ll look into the value of a
print product in the digital age. But first, Congress still needs to
vote on a deal to keep the government funded until September. How likely
is it to pass? And later, streaming platform Showmax is ramping up
production and boosting a roster of African-made programs.

<h2 id="top-us-congressional-leaders-say-spending-deal-reached">Top US
Congressional Leaders Say Spending Deal Reached</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The top Republican and Democrat in the U.S. Congress on
Tuesday said they had reached a deal to keep the government funded
through the rest of the fiscal year that began in October, setting off a
race to pass it before a weekend shutdown deadline. </p>
<p>The last sticking point was funding for the Department of Homeland
Security, as a surge in migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border has become a
major issue in the election rematch between Democratic President Joe
Biden and his Republican predecessor Donald Trump. </p>
<p>Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and Democratic Senate Majority
Leader Chuck Schumer revealed the agreement in a pair of statements on
Tuesday morning. </p>
<p>The actual legislative text of the agreement, which must be finalized
before lawmakers can vote on it, is still being completed. Current House
rules require that lawmakers have three days to consider legislation
before bringing it to the floor. </p>
<p>The package was expected to cover about three-quarters of
discretionary government spending, due to come in at about $1.66
trillion for the fiscal year ending September 30. It contains funding
for functions that include the U.S. military, transportation, housing
and food safety. </p>
<p>But more fights lie ahead as the nation’s $34.5 trillion national
debt continues to grow. Biden and House Republicans earlier this month
laid out proposed budgets for the next fiscal year, which begins in
October, that offered sharply contrasting priorities. </p>
<p>Johnson so far has also refused to bring up for a vote a $95 billion
foreign security aid package that includes money that advocates say is
urgently needed for Ukraine in its war against Russia.  </p>
<p>The measure has been approved by the Senate with bipartisan support
and is thought to have significant backing in the House if members were
given a chance to vote.  </p>
<p>Democrats and Republicans in Congress have been fighting since early
last year on funding levels amid a push by hardline House Republicans to
cut more spending than had been agreed to in a bipartisan deal enacted
into law last June.</p>

<p>When they report on Trump’s financial situation they don’t take into
account that the property, golf courses, buildings, etc are all
mortgaged beyond the max, that’s what the NY trial was about, him lying
about values for the purpose of getting loans on the property. So his
equity in these investments is probably 0 or even negative (because of
the fraud). No one is going to loan him anything on the properties,
because he has no equity, and the story they tell about New York state
liquidating his assets, there almost certainly is nothing to liquidate.
Anyone who owns a home and has a mortgage can understand this, it works
the same way even if the property is much more valuable than a family
home. I asked jokingly what his credit rating must be, but it’s a good
question to ask, would help regular people relate to the situation.</p>

energy deployment in the U.S. will grow dramatically by 2050, so long as
developers can bring down costs. The DOE says geothermal could account
for up to a third of the additional clean energy the country will need
by 2050 to hit President Biden’s emissions targets and meet growing
electricity demand, <em>E&amp;E News</em>
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0f89f71c95&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a>.
Geothermal energy harnesses the heat from beneath the Earth’s surface
for around-the-clock clean energy. Innovations in drilling technology
are expected to bring the price of geothermal power down from $100 per
megawatt-hour to as low as $60 per megawatt-hour by 2030, which would
put it roughly in line with other energy sources, the DOE said. And new
geothermal sites will need to be tapped: The report said 18 states will
likely have geothermal operations by 2050, up from seven now.

that “top oil executives took to the stage … to vocally oppose calls for
a quick move away from fossil fuels.” “We should abandon the fantasy of
phasing out oil and gas, and instead invest in them adequately,” said
Amin Nasser, CEO of Saudi Aramco. His remarks were reportedly met with
applause and echoed by leaders from Shell, Petrobras, and Exxon Mobil.
Petrobras CEO Jean Paul Prates warned rushing the energy transition will
create a “crisis that we will never forget.” Meg O’Neill, CEO of
Woodside Energy, said the debate had become too “emotional,” and claimed
the market for clean fuel technologies is some decades away. U.S. Energy
Secretary Jennifer Granholm pushed back, pointing to projections showing
oil and gas peaking demand by 2030, and called the transition “an
undeniable, inevitable, and necessary realignment of the world’s energy
system.”

<li>Harvard pulls the plug on solar geoengineering experiment

a plan to conduct what would have been one of the first solar
geoengineering experiments in the stratosphere. Solar geoengineering –
also known as “solar radiation management” – involves reflecting
sunlight back into space by spraying aerosols into the stratosphere in
an attempt to cool temperatures on Earth. It has long been a somewhat
fringe idea among scientific circles – a sort of option of last resort –
but interest has grown as global emissions climb and the Earth gets
hotter. While most solar geoengineering research has happened in labs,
Harvard’s Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment (SCoPEx) was
going to launch a high-altitude balloon to release aerosols and observe
their behavior. But the project was controversial from the start and
encountered multiple delays. In the end its lead investigator walked
away. “The platform developed for SCoPEx is expected to be repurposed
for basic scientific research in the stratosphere unrelated to solar
geoengineering,” the university said in a

<p>Developing great products is something like the NBA which they always
say is a business, esp when a player you love is traded. Happened
recently with a point guard, Immanuel Quickley, traded from Knicks to
Raptors. He wasn’t the only heart of the Knicks, but he was one of them.
He has a competitive grace you don’t see very often. Quickley was one of
those guys you knew would be the starting point guard on some NBA team,
he was that good. But he was unlikely to get there on the Knicks, so we
can be happy for him because he is the starting point guard on the
Raptors, but we lost something important there. But the business side,
if done well, opens the door for bigger love. I love watching the Knicks
win they way they are winning now. That’s what I want from developing
software. I want to create a global team of truly independent
developers, filling the void left by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation">predation</a> of the
silos. There won’t even be a business model for much of what we do, but
there will be lots of teamwork and lots of fun, because the best
accomplishment is when we do it as a team. We’re going to play a game we
started to play in the mid-90s, and somewhere somehow forgot we could
still play it. We can. I am old now, I feel it, I can’t produce end-user
software much longer, but I don’t want to leave until we have this thing
rebooted.</p>

13 is the end of the FreeBSD version</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>Bad news from BSD land – the oldest vendor of BSD systems is changing
direction away from FreeBSD and toward Linux. NAS vendor iXsystems has
been busy this year, but apart from some statements in online user
communities, it hasn’t been talking about the big news. Back in 2022, we
covered TrueNAS CORE 13, the new release of its FreeBSD-based turnkey OS
for NAS servers, and in that article we mentioned its new product, the
Debian-based TrueNAS SCALE, aimed at providing storage for Kubernetes
users. Now it seems the company is betting its future on that
Linux-based product, meaning the end is in sight for the FreeBSD
offering. ↫ Liam Proven at The Register Very sad to read, as more
monoculture is not exactly great, but at the same time, from a corporate
perspective, it’s also not entirely unexpected to focus on the server
operating system with by far the widest industry support. I hope the
fork mentioned in the article gains some steam, because having
competition in this space is crucially important.</p>

Today, tech’s darling is artificial intelligence. Like social media, it
has the potential to change the world in many ways, some favorable to
democracy. But at the same time, it has the potential to do incredible
damage to society…

Carbon Removal Startup Is Eyeing a Major Price Milestone</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTc2MjU5MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyMTIwNzczNH0.tgYnLh4V54HUWoemJ5hX0M-ljUPwnl7PDPOU7F37jsc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Pretty much every startup that’s building machines to suck carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere and stash it underground has claimed it will
be able to get its costs down to less than $100 per ton — eventually.
</p>
<p>
But a new contender in the race, a San Francisco-based company called
Spiritus, is making a compelling case that it could get there faster. On
Tuesday, Spiritus announced plans to build its first direct air capture,
or “DAC” project in central Wyoming, nicknamed Orchard One. The company
will start small but ultimately wants to expand the facility to capture
2 million tons of CO2 per year.
</p>
<p>
Achieving that scale at the sub-$100 price point would be
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/secretary-granholm-launches-carbon-negative-earthshots-remove-gigatons-carbon-pollution" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">game-changing
for direct air capture</a>, which is still far too expensive to be a
viable climate solution. Most companies in the field are cagey about
revealing their current costs, but the industry-average price is
<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/08/how-to-get-direct-air-capture-under-150-per-ton-to-meet-net-zero-goals/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">believed
to be between $600 and $1,000</a> per ton.
</p>
<p>
So what makes Spiritus different? Here are three reasons we’ll be
keeping an eye on the company.
</p>
<h3>
It’s making use of a potentially … fruitful new material
</h3>
<p>
Spiritus’ project will not look anything like the
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/oced/DACHubs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">industrial-style
shipping containers full of fans</a> that have become the defining form
factor for DAC plants. The company’s central innovation is a squishy
white ball that founder Charles Cadieu describes as an artificial lung.
</p>
<p>
“While it looks kind of simple, it’s actually a breakthrough material
that has an incredible amount of surface area,” he told me over Zoom,
while holding one up and squeezing it like a stress relief toy. “And it
has holes all over it that allow the CO2 to go right inside.” Though
it’s about the size of a tennis ball, its branch-like interior structure
has a surface area equivalent to a tennis <em>court</em>, he said.
</p>

</p>
<p>
The ball is made of a proprietary material that selectively attracts CO2
molecules. As air wafts through it, CO2 sticks to its interior surfaces
like a magnet. Spiritus will manufacture millions of these balls, lay
them out on trays, and stack the trays on tree-like rigs — hence the
name Orchard One. Concept images depict a small colony of cylindrical
structures that will house the trays, almost like miniature
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_City" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wilco
towers</a>, sprouting up amid the Wyoming sagebrush.

</p>
<p>
After a few hours exposed to the elements, the balls, which Spiritus
prefers to call “fruits,” will be full of carbon. The company will then
transfer them to a separate chamber and apply heat, causing them to
expel the CO2. That stream of carbon will be compressed and delivered to
an underground CO2 storage well, while the fruits will be returned to
their towers to live the same day over and over again.
</p>
<h3>
It requires a lot less energy
</h3>
<p>
Though the concept is somewhat whimsical, the company is making serious
claims about its cost and performance. The biggest expenses for direct
air capture projects are materials and energy, and Spiritus has made
significant improvements on both fronts. Cadieu told me they can
manufacture their sorbent for a tenth of the cost of other, “state of
the art sorbents that are out there today,” and that “furthermore, it’s
10 times as effective” at capturing carbon. In other words, Spiritus
claims it can capture more carbon from the air at a time, using fewer,
cheaper materials than other methods.
</p>
<p>
Since the capture part of the process is passive, the company doesn’t
need to use energy-intensive fans to filter the air. Also, the
temperature required for the second step, where heat is applied to the
balls to release the CO2, is lower than 212 degrees Fahrenheit — low
enough to be generated using electricity. Cadieu said Spiritus plans to
procure energy from renewable sources so that the entire process has
net-negative greenhouse gas emissions.
</p>
<p>
Spiritus isn’t the only company with a low-cost sorbent and passive
capture method. Notably, the DAC process
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/heirloom-carbon-microsoft-removal" target="_self">pioneered
by Heirloom</a>, which opened its first commercial-scale plant in
California last year, shares those features, but it requires much higher
temperatures — 1,650 degree Fahrenheit — to isolate the captured carbon.
</p>
<p>
Though Spiritus still has to prove this all works as promised in the
real world, the company has earned an early vote of confidence from
Frontier, the coalition of tech companies with a $1 billion fund to help
carbon removal scale. Last year, Frontier
<a href="https://frontierclimate.com/writing/fall-2023-purchases" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">paid
Spiritus $500,000</a> to buy its first 713 removal credits, each of
which represents a ton of carbon that will be permanently sequestered
underground. (The money is more of a development grant than anything
indicative of the company’s costs.)
</p>
<p>
“We look for companies that learn and iterate quickly, and we were
impressed by what we saw from Spiritus when they applied,” Joanna
Klitzke, the procurement and ecosystem strategy lead at Frontier, told
me. “And actually, since then, the team has made really strong
improvements and steady progress on both their sorbent and their process
performance.”
</p>
<p>
According to the company’s application for funding from Frontier,
Spiritus estimates that for the first phase of Orchard One — when the
project is capturing less than 2,000 tons per year — its levelized cost
per ton of carbon will be about $149, not including the cost of burying
the carbon underground. By phase two, at a scale of about 500,000 tons
per year, it expects to get that cost down to less than $100. And by
phase three, at the full scale of 2 million tons per year, it expects to
achieve sub-$75 capture.
</p>
<p>
Cadieu told me the company is already in talks with large buyers to
purchase carbon removal from Orchard One for “far less” than the per-ton
price Frontier paid.
</p>
<h3>
It’s following the three rules of real estate: location, location,
location
</h3>
<p>
Spiritus doesn’t expect to have phase one of the project up and running
until 2026. But it already has a running start. The land lease is locked
down, the underground pore space where the company will inject the
captured carbon has been identified, and a monitoring well is already
scheduled to be drilled — according to its Frontier application.
</p>
<p>
Wyoming has proved to be a relatively welcoming place for this emerging
industry. Orchard One is joining another direct air capture plant
already under development in the southwest part of the state called
<a href="https://www.carboncapture.com/project-bison-wy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Project
Bison</a>. Cadieu gave three reasons the project landed there: There’s a
local workforce with relevant experience from the oil and gas industry,
the state has the ideal geology to trap the captured carbon underground,
and Wyoming has been at the forefront of developing clear regulations
for carbon sequestration. It was one of the first states to gain
authorization from the Environmental Protection Agency to permit carbon
storage wells, and as of December had already permitted three. Another
advantage in Wyoming is abundant renewable energy from wind farms.
</p>
<p>
Spiritus has yet to reveal exactly where in Wyoming Orchard One will be
built, but Cadieu told me he has been in close contact with officials at
the town, county, and state levels, and that the reception has been
enthusiastic. He said the project will create “hundreds of jobs during
construction” and “many dozens of jobs” when the facility is operating,
and that the company will deliver a portion of its profits back into the
community.

<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: Old Vintage Computer Research</p>
<p>We got it in 1983, I think, so it only took me about 41 years to get
around to it. This Tomy Tutor isn’t a replacement system I secondarily
acquired, nor is it a Ship of Theseus Frankenstein rebuild. This is my
<em>actual</em> first computer, in its original case, on its original
components, with the Federated Group sticker still on the original box.
And it still works.</p>

Now, why so long? Well, for one thing, it was only supposed to be a
training wheels computer because a full Commodore 64 system would have
cost too much, but my folks wanted to see whether we’d take to a home
computer and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N8AzoDzQhM">His
High Holy Munificence Fred R. Rated</a> was blowing these babies out for
a song by then. The receipt has long since disappeared, though $99
sounds about right plus maybe around $40 or so for a joystick, cassette
deck and some cartridges, compared to somewhere between $200 and $300
for the recently discounted 64 — which didn’t include anything else. (It
tells you something about our family finances at the time when a C64 was
too <em>expensive</em>.) I immediately started writing my own BASIC
programs on it in its perverse little BASIC dialect and when my folks
indeed saved up and bought us a C64 system the next year (complete with
1702 monitor and 1541 disk drive), I refused to use it. In
<s>retaliation</s> my best interests, my parents forcibly relocated the
Tomy to storage and I went on to do even bigger things on the Commodore,
making it, not the Tutor, the defining computer of my childhood. That’s
why there’s still
<a href="/2023/05/refurb-weekend-commodore-128dcr.html">a Commodore
128DCR on my desk</a>.
<p>
<p>The other reason is that there was never really a simple way to do
it. Even when I found out what CPU was actually inside (incredibly a
16-bit TMS 9995, an evolved version of the TMS 9900 in the Texas
Instruments 99/4 and 99/4A), there was never a Tomy assembler, and other
than its small amount of scratchpad RAM (256 bytes) the entirety of the
Tutor’s 16K of memory is tied up in the 9918ANL VDP video chip. That
sort of architecture was typical for the family, but that also means
that almost everything is stored in non-executable VDP RAM, so short of
burning your own cartridge EPROMs there’s no way to actually create and
run a machine language program on the Tutor. The first flashcart for the
Tutor didn’t exist until around 2016 and it was still all ROM;
furthermore, while the 99/4A could have its CPU-addressable RAM expanded
(as well as the 99/8, its unreleased successor to which the Tomy Tutor
is closely related), there wasn’t ever a Tutor RAM expansion cartridge
either until very recently. But now there are multiple homebrew options
even for obscure home computers like this one, and at last I’ve got my
own assembly language program finally running on it.</p>

And it’s all done with its own, better I/O routines (if I do say my own
better self) as a basis for bigger projects. But first, a little tour of
the Tutor itself, and then we’ll dig in.
<p>
<p><a name='more'></a></p>
Texas Instruments’ home computer series, including the famous TI 99/4A,
was the logical consequence of TI’s “one company, one computer
architecture” policy. Indeed, the 1976 TMS 9900 CPU was basically their
16-bit 990 minicomputer architecture in an ungainly 64-pin DIP chip
package and quite possibly (the only alternative is the General
Instrument CP1600) the first single chip 16-bit microprocessor
commercially available. It was fabbed in NMOS on a 4.5 micron process
with about 8,000 transistors and initially topped out at a respectable
3MHz, though its pervasively microcoded architecture required sometimes
large cycle counts per instruction. The 9918 video display processor in
the original 99/4 evolved with a new bitmap mode to become the 9918A in
the 99/4A, and, outlasting its originator, was one of the most common
video chips of the early home computer era (Sord, MSX, CreatiVision/Dick
Smith Wizzard, ColecoVision/Coleco ADAM, and many, many more). The
original 99/4 was the winning design of three internal home system
efforts in 1979, but was derided for its “calculator” keyboard, lack of
lower case and a high MSRP; the upgraded 99/4A débuted in 1981 with an
improved keyboard, better video, more expansion options and a lower
price.
<p>
But TI was first and foremost in the chip business, and at the time was
the largest semiconductor manufacturer on the planet. TI realized that
the physical size of the CPU was harming its commercial viability —
though TI’s dubious management decisions were just as big a factor — and
developed more conventional 40-pin versions, first as microcontrollers
with on-board RAM and ROM, then with more typical 8-bit data buses. The
most advanced of these was the TMS 9995 which had a few extra opcodes, a
primitive pre-fetch facility, 256 bytes of on-chip RAM (we’ll get to why
this is notable when we discuss assembly language programming) and an
internal decrementer for timing and event counting. It was noticeably
faster than the 9900 and TI planned to implement it in its next
generation of home computers, the low-end black and white 99/2 intended
to compete against systems like the ZX-81 and Timex Sinclair 1000, and
the high-end 99/8 with more memory, built-in peripherals and a larger
keyboard.
<p>
<p>Before that could happen, however, TI got deep in the weeds against
their old nemesis Commodore under Jack Tramiel and ended up cancelling
both the 99/2 and 99/8 in 1983 (exiting the home computer market
completely in 1984), though not before there were spinoffs. It’s not
clear how Japanese toy manufacturer Tomy got involved but in 1982 Tomy
adapted the in-development 99/8 architecture using the same 9995 CPU and
9918A VDP into their own home computer in Japan, manufactured by
Matsushita (Panasonic) under contract. This computer was called the Tomy
Pyuuta (ぴゅう太, also variously romanized as the Tomy Pyuta or Tomy
Pyūta).</p>

<p>The Pyuuta wasn’t, and wasn’t intended as, a 99/8 clone. Unlike the
99/8’s higher-end aspirations, the Pyuuta was targeted explicitly at
younger children, using a friendly yet durable large plastic case and
spill-resistant rubber Chiclet keys. For cartridges Tomy licensed some
of Konami’s arcade games like Frogger and Scramble and created a few of
their own, and for peripherals they provided game controllers (included)
and a cassette recorder (optional) for saving your work. Eventually
<a href="/2020/06/tfw-you-find-last-cartridge.html">they planned to
release</a> a modem, floppy disk, printer and speech synthesizer, all
presumably using TI’s reference designs except the printer which was a
modified Astor MCP-40 plotter.</p>

Although the basic BIOS was based on the TI’s and the title screen in
particular
<a href="https://4apedia.com/index.php?title=File:Main_TI_Startup_Screen.png">is
very similar</a>, Tomy prominently advertised it was a 16-bit system,
yet focused more on games and graphics than programming. Like the
unexpanded 99/4 and 99/4A, all of the included 16K RAM in the Pyuuta is
dedicated to the VDP, for which Tomy created a built-in paint program
and a highly constrained dialect of BASIC (“G-BASIC”) to manipulate
screen elements and sprites with katakana keywords. It ran using a
10.738635MHz 945/88 crystal divided by three for video (standard NTSC
315/88 3.579545MHz) and four for the CPU (945/352, 2.68465875MHz). The
processor clock speed was slower on paper than the 3MHz 9900 in the
99/4A which came off a 12MHz crystal, but the Pyuuta was nevertheless
faster because of the 9995’s efficiencies and a critical architectural
difference I’ll discuss shortly.
<p>
<p>The Pyuuta was a reasonable success in Japan and Tomy decided to
export it to other markets by translating the OS and G-BASIC to English.
This updated version was imported more or less directly by Adam Imports
UK as the Grandstand Tutor, but reviewers were displeased with G-BASIC’s
profound limitations and the machine was quietly withdrawn. As an
upgrade TI must have provided (unwittingly or otherwise) the code for TI
Extended BASIC to Tomy to port, since Tomy BASIC has similar to nearly
identical tokens, memory usage and syntax, and a full BASIC based on it
was released first as an add-on device for the Pyuuta and then built-in
to the next generation system Tomy themselves intended to sell in the
United States. This was the Tomy Tutor in 1983.</p>

Tomy USA hired <i>Real People</i> host Sarah Purcell as their
spokeperson, who touted the computer as a system so easy to use that
kids could teach themselves how to use it (it’s true: I did!). She
wasn’t as high-profile as TI’s Bill Cosby, but she was hardly unknown to
the target demographic(’s parents), and she hadn’t committed any
criminal offenses either. Unfortunately their otherwise promising
marketing campaign was most notable for the most frequent use of the
word “real” in a single pamphlet, as well as a five-day
kick-the-tires-for-free deal which was about as successful as Apple’s
later “Test Drive a Macintosh” promotion. (NARRATOR: By which he means
it wasn’t.)
<p>
<p>Like the Pyuuta, Tomy prominently touted the Tutor’s 16-bit
processor, but provided no way to directly access it. A couple years
earlier the Tutor might have been a compelling system and one of the
“real” kids on the box even wrote me a few years back to mention he
rather enjoyed the games, but the video game crash was in full swing by
then and Tomy’s intentional toy aesthetic quickly became the kiss of

<p>Tomy apparently lost so much money on the Tutor that they ended up
producing very few peripherals for the system in either the United
States or Japan. This picture shows the complete setup in the United
States, namely a tape recorder with custom electronics, an Anglicized
version of those disc-based joy controllers which made the Intellivision
seem like a paragon of ergonomics, and a tough-as-nails single joystick
sold as the Joy Stick (insert joke here). And that was it. The floppy
disk drive, printer and speech synthesizer promised in both countries
never appeared as other than a single picture in the Purcell pamphlet,
the printer interface sold in Japan as part of the BASIC-1 add-on was
never sold abroad, and most critically the “TI Adaptor” — nothing less
than a Tomy rebadge of the
<a href="http://unige.ch/medecine/nouspikel/ti99/pebox.htm">TI
Peripheral Expansion Box</a> — that would have included additional
memory and storage options was vapourware too.</p>

<p>The Tutor was also not an exact copy of the Pyuuta either, although
the core silicon (the 9995 CPU, 9918A VDP video chip [9929A for PAL] and
SN76489 DCSG sound chip) is the same, primarily differing in the BIOS
ROM, the absence of a Japanese character set, the presence of Tomy
BASIC, and slightly different memory banking logic. The systems are
otherwise nearly totally compatible such that Japanese Pyuuta cartridges
will generally run on American or PAL Tutors and vice versa, language
support notwithstanding, with only one of the American cartridges — its
sole explicitly educational title — being specific to the United
States.</p>

<p>The Tutor, as with the Pyuuta before it, started with the TI 99/4A’s
title screen but with animation, scrolling the colour bars vertically.
It felt like a friendly computer from the moment you turned it on and
the larger 32x24 text cells actually reinforced that somewhat (plus
making it much easier to read on our little Panasonic colour TV).</p>

The Tutor menu, directly translated from the Japanese menu in the
Pyuuta, was also inspired by the TI’s menu, but instead uses a “pointer”
rather than selecting items by number. It was likewise very easy for a
child to grasp. On the Tutor, the GRAPHIC and BASIC modes are always
available as part of its sizeable 48K of built-in ROM. The CARTRIDGE
option only appears if a cartridge is detected, which we’ll talk about
in a moment.
<p>
<p>Unlike the TI 99/4A which used serially addressed “GROMs” for BASIC
and much other software (which on top of that can’t contain native code
and are necessarily written in an interpreted bytecode called GPL), all
of the Tutor ROMs and cartridges are directly connected to the bus and
therefore tremendously faster. Although Tomy BASIC is also based on GPL,
Tomy’s GPL dialect is a stripped-down variant specialized for this task,
and the program text is directly accessible like any other data in ROM.
All of this, plus the 9995’s prefetch, are why the Tutor’s (and
Pyuuta’s) slightly slower clocked CPU runs so much more swiftly in
practice than the 99/4A’s.</p>

<p>The Tutor’s GRAPHIC mode is a simple built-in paint program that
takes full advantage of the 9918A’s 256x192 bitmap mode, offering two
colours per line in each 8x8 cell — substantially better than systems
like the C64 or ZX Spectrum with two colours per <em>cell</em>. A little
rocket cursor moved with the arrow keys indicated the current location,
and when you were at the desired cell, you could then edit it using the
palette and the editing square on the lower right. GRAPHIC mode also
supported four large 16x16 sprites — to hide the 9918’s limitation of no
more than four sprites per scan line — which could be crudely moved or
animated by GBASIC programs (no hyphen in the English name).</p>

GBASIC, however, was so limited — barely any string support, small
program space, terse syntax and a couple severe bugs — that I spent most
of my early elementary life in Tomy BASIC. I wrote some games and some
simple utilities and saved them to tape, and I still have one of these
tapes, though I carelessly overwrote most of its contents later. Yet
despite its lineage as a descendant of TI Extended BASIC, Tomy BASIC
intentionally supported less than its ancestor, likely to keep
inquisitive kids like me in a memory-safe “sandbox.” There were commands
for sound, character graphics and some custom character shapes, but most
of these features were poorly documented (if at all), and there wasn’t
any supported facility for directly accessing bitmapped graphics or
sprites — let alone arbitrary reads and writes to VDP memory.
<p>
<p>Still, the “sandbox” concept ended up being unsuccessful because a
number of Tomy BASIC commands don’t bounds-check properly, and I
remember very clearly crashing it multiple times one day trying to
figure out how the <tt>COLOR</tt> keyword worked. (Alas, I was too young
at the time to realize the significance of what I’d done.) Such bugs
even facilitated a clever hack to enable sprites, though this hack
unsurprisingly has notable limitations, and there was no way to directly
access VDP registers for other features like high resolution or
40-column mode. BASIC was as much as you could do on a stock Tutor and
other than a small user group in the Los Angeles area I didn’t know
anyone else who had one. It wasn’t until several years later that I got
the Tutor back, and by then I was knee-deep in Commodore programming,
including handcoding 6502 machine language opcodes in the Epyx FastLoad
monitor. The Tutor had been fun but I could do more with the Commodore
64 and the 128 we got after that.</p>

Emulation came late to the Tutor both due to its obscurity and a
profound lack of hardware documentation. In 1998 yours truly wrote the
first Tutor “simulator,” which I christened Tutti, ironically for the
Commodore 64 so that it could be run anywhere a C64 emulator was
supported (back then I used C64S and later Frodo). It was designed to
mimic the Tutor’s look and feel using a character set I labouriously
drew by eye, a custom keyboard driver, raster interrupts for the 9918A’s
split screen modes, simple tone audio, and colour approximations with
the VIC-II’s palette. It had a fully functional title screen and menu
plus reasonably accurate looking but very primitive GRAPHIC, GBASIC and
BASIC modes. For its behaviour I manually figured out how fast things
ran and added delays and tweaks, and reverse-engineered the BASIC and
GBASIC editors. Surprisingly, a portion of Tutti is actually part of the
project we’ll do today, so hang onto it in the back of your head.
<p>
It took five more years for the first true Tomy Tutor emulator, namely
Ian Gledhill’s 2003 TutorEm with functional 9995 and 9918A emulation; it
was very slow, very buggy, incomplete and Windows-only, but it really
did work and finally opened the floodgates. Later that year MESS added a
driver written by Raphael Nabet in 0.70 that I helped beta-test and it
is still part of modern MAME. While I have since updated TutorEm and
made many fixes for my tape-enabled Tutti II emulator, we’ll use MAME
for debugging this entry because it is currently the only Tutor emulator
that handles cartridge ROMs.
<p>
<p>Tutti didn’t emulate the CPU because I didn’t know how its I/O worked
and it would have been impossible to execute code in any performant
fashion on the C64; even the relatively lightweight 6502-on-6502
emulator I maintain for
<a href="/2023/02/instruction-fusion-and-real-serial-port.html">the
KIM-1 KIMplement emulator</a> runs about 30 times slower or so than
actual. I had done a little playing around with TMS9900 assembly on the
99/4A using the Editor/Assembler cartridge (“module”) on a friend’s
machine, and I even had a basic 9900 programming book, so the 9995
wasn’t really an alien architecture to me — which makes a good
transition into talking about the CPU itself.</p>

</div>
The original TI-990 minicomputers supported multiprogramming in a
then-innovative fashion: most of their registers were actually stored in
RAM. The only CPU-internal registers are the program counter (PC), a
Workspace Pointer (WP) that indicated where in RAM the 16 registers (32
bytes) reside, and a Status (ST) register for flags. This meant that a
context switch could be as simple as merely changing the PC, WP and ST
registers to those of the new task. Though zero or direct pages on CPUs
like the 6502 or 6809 is a related concept, the 990 WP was more
versatile and indeed absolutely intrinsic to how the 990 operated. It
has a generally orthogonal instruction set for the time (<i>ceteris
paribus</i>), and aside from R0 not being valid as an index the
registers can be used for any general purpose, though certain
instructions are fixed to specific registers like R11 as a link register
for subroutine calls or R12 as the address for bit-serial I/O over the
Communications Register Unit bus. Byte operations exist but all word
accesses are aligned to even addresses.
<p>
For the TI 99/4 in 1979 (and later the 99/4A), TI determined that
designing a full 16-bit system around the 9900 would have required new
chips for its exclusively 16-bit bus, making the effort too expensive
for a home computer. TI solved this problem by devising
<a href="http://www.unige.ch/medecine/nouspikel/ti99/architec.htm">two
buses</a>. The most directly connected 16-bit bus hosted the lowest
level system ROM with the GPL interpreter plus 256 bytes of “scratchpad
RAM” which could store eight complete sets of registers, composed of two
128-byte 8-bit static RAMs wired as low and high bytes (the 9900 is
big-endian) which the CPU could access in parallel. SRAM was expensive,
however, so the remainder of the machine’s RAM was 16K of dynamic RAM
given to the VDP, which has its own DRAM refresh circuitry.
Unfortunately, although the VDP was on this 16-bit bus also, the VDP
only supported byte accesses and ignores the lower half of the word,
slowing DRAM reads further. Worse, everything else was behind the second
“multiplexed” 8-bit bus, where a small circuit stalled out the CPU on
reads until two 8-bit fetches could assemble the full 16 bits. While
this meant less expensive 8-bit parts could be used, the cost reduction
also cost a significant amount of performance.
<p>
The use of SRAM suggests that the 99/4 was originally intended to use a
different chip that had RAM on-die, where refresh circuitry wouldn’t
have been needed, but cost and market considerations apparently
prevailed. The intended CPU may have been something like the 1979
TMS9940 with an on-chip CRU, 2K of ROM, a decrementer and 128 bytes of
SRAM, or the later TMS9985 with 8K of ROM and 256 bytes of scratchpad,
though neither would have been ready in time for the 99/4. As mentioned
earlier, after the disadvantages of the 9900’s strict 16-bit data bus
became more acute TI moved the multiplex circuitry on-chip and exposed
only an 8-bit bus starting with the TMS9980 — but this also doubled
access time to its external scratchpad RAM, condemning it to
lower-performance applications
<a href="/2022/09/what-kim-1-really-needs-is-bubble.html">like TI’s
Silent 700 teletypes</a>. TI’s first attempt was to turn the 9940 into
the 9985 by adding the same multiplexer and bumping up the ROM and
scratchpad RAM, which were both internal and thus avoided the bus
problem. There was reportedly no market appetite for the 9985, so TI
removed the ROM and reduced instruction latency further by using
prefetch steps in the microcode which could be parallel with a preceding
ALU operation. This is the 9995, released in 1981.
<p>
(A digression: how do you use the 9900 to implement a language like C?
The simplest method is to just implement a stack, which is facilitated
on the 990/9900 by its support for post-increment addressing. This is in
fact the approach taken by
<a href="https://forums.atariage.com/topic/164295-gcc-for-the-ti/">the
GCC port for the TMS9900</a>, which treats the CPU more or less like a
modern CPU with a link register [usually R11], defines an ABI for
arguments and volatile/non-volatile registers, and reserves one of the
registers as the stack pointer, in this case R10. R10 is a 16-bit
register like all the others, so the stack can be as large as the
addressing space, a significant improvement over C-hostile architectures
like the 6502. Another way is to go “full Berkeley” and treat the WP as
a means to implement register windows, a la SPARC: the WP can be moved
to any word-aligned address, so a caller can move the WP down a few
notches, set up its arguments, call the routine, capture the return
value and set it back. However, the 9995 — and for that matter the stock
99/4(A) — doesn’t have CPU-addressable RAM other than the scratchpad, so
in the base configuration neither system would have much capacity for
function calls no matter how they were implemented. The Tomy BIOS gets
around this by simply moving the WP or individual registers around by
hand, which is space efficient, but also makes some individual routines
or subsections more difficult to use because there is no standard
calling convention.)
<p>
For our purposes, although the 9995 has a few extra instructions, we can
treat it in practical terms as a faster 9900. The main difference at the
assembly level is where the scratchpad RAM lives: since it’s external to
the 9900, its location is wherever it gets decoded (e.g., in the $8000
range in the 99/4A), but in the 9995 the internal RAM always occupies
$f000-$f0fb (for compatibility with the 9900 the last four bytes are
seen at $fffc to $ffff and serve as the NMI vector). The 9995 also has
an internal decrementer at $fffa but we won’t need to deal with that
right now for this particular project. The only other concern is that
the prefetch in the 9995 will affect self-modifying code if it changes
the very next instruction which our example doesn’t do either.
Otherwise, programming it is almost completely the same.
<p>
<p>The Tomy BIOS obviously has support routines for displaying text and
reading the keyboard, but we’re not going to use them for several
reasons: first, I’m not particularly conversant in them, second, we can
probably do it faster and more flexibly ourselves, third, it’s good
education, and fourth, they kind of suck. For input, while we can’t do
anything about the Tutor’s mushy Chiclets or its single SHIFT key, we
certainly can improve upon the BIOS’ terrible key rollover.
Additionally, the Tutor’s default character set is inconveniently
organized for modern applications: wile you can apparently use the
<tt>SCELL()</tt> (the Tomy equivalent of TI <tt>CALL HCHAR</tt>) command
to store characters by their ASCII value directly into VDP screen
memory, this is in fact an artifact of BASIC and not actually how the
glyphs are laid out in VDP RAM. We would like to organize our character
set to be <em>exactly</em> the same as true ASCII so that no translation
is needed, as well as support the 9918A’s 40 column text mode which the
Tutor BIOS never did. To do all of these things, we’ll devise our own
library.</p>

<p>The homebrew hardware we’ll use is all from TeamEurope (hi Klaus!),
who made one of the earliest Tutor flash multicarts. This is
<a href="https://team-europe.blogspot.com/2023/12/tomy-tutorpyuta-ram-cartridge-updated.html">his
newest unit</a> which is the only currently available CPU RAM expansion
for the Tomy Tutor and Pyuuta, providing 16K of CPU-accessible RAM in
two 8K ranges as well as multiple 32K ROMs accessible by DIP switch from
a 512K flash ROM. (This cartridge was actually conceived of first by
<a href="https://tms9918.hatenablog.com/entry/2018/01/18/211846">tanam</a>,
but this unit is an expansion of that design.) We’ll explore this device
more in <a href="/search/label/tomy%20tutor">a future entry</a>.
However, we don’t need the RAM nor the extra ROM capacity today and the
device additionally requires a passive I/O port adapter for those extra
addressing lines, so we’ll use one of his simpler items.</p>

<p>That simpler item is
<a href="https://team-europe.blogspot.com/2019/05/flashcartsmulticarts-for-tomy.html">this
one, his first</a>. It has every USA and Japanese cartridge ROM except
the very rare USA and Japanese Demonstration cartridges — with a little
luck I’m hoping to rectify that soon. It also lacks the later “3-D”
series (a misnomer, they weren’t 3D with the possible exception of
<i>Rescue Copter</i>) which require the extra addressing line for 32K
ROMs and are provided on a separate multicart.</p>

<p>The flash ROM itself is a socketed off-the-shelf 512K Microchip
Technology SST39SF040. These chips are end-of-life but they’re still
inexpensive and easy to find as DIPs or PLCCs, and by using Klaus’ board
I don’t need to make one of my own. For this I started with another DIP
39SF040 that I got cheaply since we won’t need to do too many insertion
cycles on the socket to get this simple program working. There is free
space in the default cartridge loadout for four more 16K ROM images and
we’ll use two of them.</p>

Pretty much any programmer will work for this. Since my daily driver is
a POWER9 Linux workstation, I use the open-source
<a href="https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/minipro">minipro</a> and this
older XGecu TL866-II+ (minipro has experimental support for the newer
T48 but the TL866-II+ is well-tested with it; unfortunately you can’t
trust many of the eBay and Amazon sellers to get you the older model).
<p>
For the cross-assembler, we’ll use
<a href="http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/">the AS
macroassembler</a>, which is multi-architecture, cross-platform,
open-source and has specific support for the 9995. It builds just fine
on any modern OS, including Linux and macOS. The macroassembler will
create an intermediate object which we then link with an included tool
into the final executable.
<p>
The Tomy machines place their VDP ports at $e000 and $e002 in the 9995’s
regular addressing space, while the keyboard and joy controllers (which
share keyboard lines) are on the CRU bus at $ec00 through $ec70 with
each group of eight lines separated by 16. The “little” 8K and “medium”
16K cartridges both are mapped to $8000-$bfff, where the Tutor expects
to see two $55 bytes at $8000. If these two $55 bytes are present, the
CARTRIDGE option is enabled in the menu, which triggers a jump to $8002.
(There are other ways to signal its presence, but this method is the
simplest and the one used by the majority of official Tomy cartridges.)
So we’ll start off with this:
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
        padding off

        ; vdp ports on the tutor
vdpwd   equ 0e000h
vdpwr   equ 0e002h
        ; CRU address for reading the keyboard
keycru  equ 0ec00h

        org 08000h

        ; cartridge signature word
        word 05555h
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The leading zeroes for these particular 16-bit values are a required
quirk of AS. Since we’re using all our own routines, we don’t want any
interference from the BIOS, so we’ll turn off all interrupts by setting
the interrupt mask to zero and load the WP with the lowest address of
the 9995’s built-in scratchpad RAM. (We’ll have more to say about
interrupts later.)
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
        limi 0
        lwpi 0f000h     ; don't even trust the Tomy OS here
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The Tomy Tutor BIOS gives us literally nothing to work with anyway:
before the cartridge is started, the registers are set to default values
and the entire VDP RAM is cleared. That means there’s no screen matrix
nor a character set, and we’ll have to write them to VDP RAM ourselves.
(The expectation is that you’d call the BIOS’ own utility routines to
set those up, and that’s indeed what regular Tomy cartridges do, but
we’re not going to do that here.) To make working with the VDP a bit
more convenient, we’ll construct a little utility subroutine.
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
vdpr    ; write to VDP registers
        ; MSB of r0: command nybble + value (8r = register,
        ; 4x = MSB VDP RAM for write, 0x = for read)
        ; LSB of r0: new register value (xx) or LSB of VDP RAM address
        ; the swapping around gives enough time for the VDP to operate,
        ; and we have no IRQs on, so nothing will interfere
        swpb r0
        movb r0, @vdpwr
        swpb r0
        movb r0, @vdpwr
        b *r11
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Recall that the 9918A only has an eight-bit data bus, so we must
communicate with it through byte-sized operations. This subroutine takes
a single 16-bit argument in r0 that either encodes an absolute VDP RAM
address for reading or writing, or encodes one of the eight VDP
registers and the byte to store in it. (Because of the way these
addresses are represented, i.e., either $4xxx to write or $0xxx to read,
a “super 9918A” would need to implement some sort of bankswitching
register to handle more than 16K. The only other supported RAM size for
the 9918A is 4K.) The LSB goes out on the bus first and the 9995 is
big-endian, so for each byte we swap them before sending it to the
9918A’s control register, exiting back to the caller through r11 as our
link register. As a happy convenience the swap operation takes just long
enough for the 9918A to handle the bus transaction and be ready for the
next. With that, we can set the following:
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
        ; register 0 turn off bitmap and external video
        li r0,08000h
        bl @vdpr
        ; register 1
        ; - 16K mode
        ; screen off

        ; (the only colours available for 40-column)
        li r0,087f2h
        bl @vdpr
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The locations for the screen table, colour table, character set, sprites
and so forth are encoded as
<a href="http://www.unige.ch/medecine/nouspikel/ti99/tms9918a.htm#Registers">multiples
of particular alignments</a>. For our character set, we’ll reorganize
the Tutti one to match ASCII order (I told you we’d be coming back to
that), add that to our binary and copy it in. We’re only using positions
32-127, so there is plenty of space for expansion if we want to add
graphics characters or an alternate font weight (for this purpose I just
added a reverse/inverse set). Once we set the VDP memory address, we can
just keep sending data to the data port as the VDP’s address internally
autoincrements with each write or read.
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
        ; load our font to >0000
        li r0,04000h
        bl @vdpr
        li r1,fontt
lup     movb *r1+,@vdpwd
        ci r1,fontt+00800h
        jne lup
</pre>
</div>
<p>
We go on to clear our screen in the same way (by storing the appropriate
number of space characters starting from the top left of screen memory),
then set the colour matrix (if 32 columns), print our character set and
display a welcome message in similar fashion.
<p>
Next, we want to accept keyboard input and echo it to the user. Despite
the rubbery nature of the keycaps themselves and their non-standard
layout, the keyboard matrix proper is actually pretty good quality: each
key independently sets a particular bit in the matrix and some quick
tests show there’s little to no shorting or ghosting. Reading it is a
simple matter of requesting every key bit in groups of eight from the
CRU at their specific addresses. However, like any keyboard handler,
we’ll need to properly debounce the keys, and this is where the Tomy
BIOS is particularly bad: if you type too quickly and multiple keys are
down as you transition from one keys to the next, the keyscan routine
will fail to make a match and the new key will be dropped. This makes
the Tutor’s already somewhat mushy keyboard even worse to type on, an
absolutely needless situation since the Tomy keyboard has all the
<em>hardware</em> requirements to implement N-key rollover and is only
let down by its <em>software</em>. The solution is to track each
individual key bit using the debounce matrix to filter out key bits we
already know were previously down. This is made a bit easier by the fact
there’s only one modifier key to watch (i.e., SHIFT), but the principles
are the same.
<p>
<div class="tx">

</pre>
</div>
<p>
The “keyzone” block is our current matrix followed by the debounce
matrix we’ll use to filter it. This section can be entered either from
<tt>keezc</tt> to blank the debounce matrix, falling through to
<tt>keez</tt> to read it. Reading from the CRU requires placing the CRU
address (a parallel addressing space) into R12 and asking for the needed
number of bits. We fetch in groups of eight bits which are in eight
locations stored 16 CRU bytes apart, keeping a running logical-OR (which
the 9900/9995 atypically calls <tt>soc</tt>/<tt>socb</tt> “Set Ones
Corresponding” for non-immediate arguments). If the value of the running
logical-OR was zero, then no key was pressed, we branch back to clear
the debounce, and go scan the matrix again.
<p>
The simplest case is where the current state of the matrix exactly
equals the last time (modulo the state of the SHIFT key). This can be
checked for by exclusive-ORing with the debounce matrix, masking off the
SHIFT bit. We then logical-OR all the resulting bits together and if
it’s zero again, we go back to scanning — but leave the debounce matrix
alone.
<p>

</pre>
</div>
<p>
This is the block of code we’d use to set up key repeat, which as
currently written this routine doesn’t support yet (an exercise for the
future). Otherwise, we need to filter the debounce to remove any keys
that are now <em>up</em>, filter the new matrix to remove any keys
already present in the debounce (which may give us another zero matrix
again, but our keyscan table doesn’t match an all zeroes matrix, so it’s
“fine”), and update the debounce matrix with the new bits that are down
while clearing the SHIFT flag. This heavily uses the oddball
<tt>szc</tt> instruction, which is an inverted logical-AND (though, like
<tt>soc</tt> and <tt>ori</tt>, there is a regular immediate
<tt>andi</tt> that is <em>not</em> inverted, a curious non-orthogonality
in the instruction set). I won’t show every store here but I’ll give the
overall flavour — there’s probably a more efficient way to do it than
I’ve done, but this is also pretty easy to follow conceptually:
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
        ; remove any bits in the debounce that aren't set currently
        mov @keyzone,r0
        inv r0
        szc r0,@keyzone+8       ; inverted and
        mov @keyzone+2,r0
        inv r0
        szc r0,@keyzone+10
[...]
        ; remove any bits in the new keyscan that were still set in debounce
        ; if we end up with a cleared keyscan, it doesn't matter since we
        ; won't be able to decode it anyway
        mov @keyzone,r0
        szc @keyzone+8,r0       ; inverted and
        mov r0,@keyzone
        mov @keyzone+2,r0
        szc @keyzone+10,r0
        mov r0,@keyzone+2

        ; update debounce, clearing shift
        ; add any new bits to debounce so they get masked off too

        mov r0,@keyzone+12
        mov @keyzone+6,r0
        soc @keyzone+14,r0
        andi r0,0fbffh
        mov r0,@keyzone+14
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Now with a clean set of keybits, we need to match them against a table.
I organized a table of four words representing the eight matrix bytes in
ASCII order so once you’ve found a matching set, the index into the
table is the result. This table is stored at label <tt>keytab</tt> and
looks like this:
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
[...]
        ; symbols and numbers, 32-64
        ; SPACE
        word 00000h, 00000h, 00000h, 08000h
        ; !
        word 00100h, 00000h, 00000h, 00400h
        ; "
        word 00200h, 00000h, 00000h, 00400h
        ; #
        word 00001h, 00000h, 00000h, 00400h
        ; $
        word 00002h, 00000h, 00000h, 00400h
[...]
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The Tutor does not have CONTROL or ALT keys, just SHIFT, nor does it
have a backspace or delete. This lets us redefine our special keys (the
cursor keys, MON and MOD) to generate indices in the control character
range. Our table turns MOD into ^C (consistent with its use in Tomy
BASIC as break), LEFT/UP/DOWN/RIGHT as ^H ^K ^M/CR ^L, RT (RETURN) as
^J/LF, and MOD as ^[/ESC. To round out other common ASCII points the
default keyboard doesn’t generate, ^I/TAB is encoded as SHIFT-SPACE,
backtick as SHIFT-UP, tilde as SHIFT-DOWN and ^?/DEL as SHIFT-LEFT. The
pipe and backslash characters remain represented by flat and
degree/handaku, which have the same ASCII value. The only key our matrix
table does not handle is LOCK, which would be <tt>word 00000h, 00000h,
00000h, 00200h</tt>. I’d probably implement this as a conventional CAPS
LOCK defaulting to up but we’ll exclude that from the logic for now.
Anything not matched in the table gets a result of 0.

<p>
Like the debounce comparator, this code XORs the current matrix value
against the current table entry; if it gets all zeroes, we have a match.
At the end the resulting character code is in R6 and R0.
Parenthetically, the 9900 has a <tt>inct</tt> instruction that
increments by two instead of just one with regular <tt>inc</tt>, useful
for skipping words (you can also use an instruction like <tt>c
<em>r1+,</em>r1+</tt> to increment by four in one word).
<p>
Because we left the VDP memory pointer at the end of our “hello world”
blurb, to print the character to the screen we could simply do <tt>swpb
r0</tt> to get it in the upper byte followed by <tt>movb r0,<span
class="citation" data-cites="vdpwd">@vdpwd</span></tt>. This doesn’t
scroll at the end as there’s no bounds-checking, and remember the Tutor
doesn’t have a backspace (control characters are simply printed as
blanks anyway), but it’s really really fast. However, we also want to
display a cursor for we’ll use our reversed space character, so we’ll
keep a rolling screen pointer in R7. We’ll additionally have RT clear
the screen and as a convenience use MON to bail out to the Tomy title.

</div>
<p>
The simplest way to go back to the title screen is to call the Tutor’s
reset vector, but paradoxically the 9900’s built-in <tt>rset</tt>
instruction is <em>not</em> what we want for this. There are a handful
of TI-990 holdovers called
<a href="https://www.unige.ch/medecine/nouspikel/ti99/tms9900.htm#External"><i>external
instructions</i></a> which were used for special context switching
operations, such as <tt>lrex</tt> to jump into front panel code.
However, on the 9900/9995, most of the instructions with the possible
exception of <tt>idle</tt> do nothing useful and in some cases could be
potentially harmful depending on what’s listening on the bus.
<p>
Instead, we’ll use the low memory vectors. 9900 vectors consist of a
pair of WP and PC words, with interrupt vectors starting at $0000. When
an interrupt is triggered, or a vector is branched to using the
<tt>blwp</tt> instruction, the WP and PC are loaded in order from those
words (instantly saving the previous code’s registers, assuming there is
no conflict) and the previous values of WP, PC and ST are placed in the
new R13, R14 and R15 respectively. The <tt>rtwp</tt> instruction then
reverses everything using those registers and thus returns to the prior
execution context. Theoretically the TMS9900 can support up to 16 levels
of interrupt, starting at $0000 with level 0 for resets through $003c
for level 15, though the 99/4 and 99/4A just wire everything to
interrupt level 1. In the 9900 memory map these vectors are followed by
XOP vectors for up to 16 software-defined opcodes via the <tt>xop</tt>
family of instructions.
<p>
However, the 9995 only implements seven distinct interrupt levels, two
of which are actually software interrupts (and one of those doesn’t even
work properly according to the manual errata). The highest level is
level 0, connected to the reset pin, followed by the <tt>mid</tt>
interrupt used for software opcodes, then NMIs, and then four numbered
interrupts consisting of an external interrupt (1) on the INT1 pin, a
not-reliably-functional arithmetic overflow interrupt (2), the on-chip
decrementer (3) and another external interrupt (4) on INT2. These have
their own vectors except for the MID interrupt and interrupt level 2
which share the same vector, and other than the NMI vector at $fffc all
the rest come from low memory as well.
<p>
In this particular regard, the Tutor is no different from the 99/4A: a
<tt>blwp 0</tt> will jump into the reset vector at $0000, just as if
you’d powered the machine on and allowing you to go back to the menu.
While the Tutor also uses the same reset vector values for levels 1 and
2, level 3 (the decrementer) runs normally to service its regular tasks
and the level 4 (external INT2 triggered) interrupt is used for
triggering on tape reads. On the other hand, the Tutor uses the entire
XOP vector range as part of a jump table, so it isn’t possible to use
any XOP instructions on the Tutor with the standard ROMs (the 99/4A at
least has
<a href="http://www.unige.ch/medecine/nouspikel/ti99/tms9900.htm#XOP">a
couple useful values there</a>). Anyway, all this is to say that a
simple <tt>blwp 0</tt> will be sufficient.
<p>
<p>That’s pretty much it, and we’re ready to assemble our first draft.
I’ll get to the code in a minute, but let’s test it in MAME with
<tt>mame tutor -skip_gameinfo -cart tello.rom</tt>. Our character set
and welcome message appear beautifully though typing is a bit …
messy.</p>

<p>The problem isn’t our code, it’s MAME’s default settings. You’ll find
the same mojibake occurs while typing in regular BASIC as well. I
mentioned that the keyboard matrix is shared with the joy controller
lines (though that’s actually useful because it allows you to read some
keys from GBASIC which wouldn’t ordinarily permit this), and because
MAME defines some keys for the controller, you can’t type normally with
the default keyboard settings. In my case, I have a Hyperkin Trooper 2
USB joystick I use for Tutor games because it has two buttons for SL and
SR, so I removed the key equivalents for the joy controllers and set it
to exclusively use the joystick. Now we can type normally.</p>

<p>And as hoped for, typing now flows beautifully. There is one more
issue we need to solve, though:</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjO6ve2aurIKxK0yia2DJVsAsG0_-kAoD-JHj6ABaTZTD1nLgI58-huJw-zFymd14LlvtguZgJSqjc3amEkG2sf4dUvXPL_KYYksUJqbYazvRem-J73uBhbL9DhmyUk_N3nk0TGDi9ziLk1kQ1x8kYRXxscBJtLjh4PyNYbcGq0MBXOcQpPx5Cz-nT6Oko/s792/mame40-1.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="630" data-original-width="792" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjO6ve2aurIKxK0yia2DJVsAsG0_-kAoD-JHj6ABaTZTD1nLgI58-huJw-zFymd14LlvtguZgJSqjc3amEkG2sf4dUvXPL_KYYksUJqbYazvRem-J73uBhbL9DhmyUk_N3nk0TGDi9ziLk1kQ1x8kYRXxscBJtLjh4PyNYbcGq0MBXOcQpPx5Cz-nT6Oko/s320/mame40-1.png"/></a>
</div>
<p>I mentioned we would like this to also support the 9918A’s 40 column
mode, something the Tutor BIOS doesn’t but would be very useful for
productivity applications (the Tutor has a lot of great games but it’s
time it achieved its potential, darn it). With a little tweaking we can
turn on the 40 column bit in VDP register 1 and adjust our message and
screen layout so everything ends up in the right place. However, the
9918A can’t display a 320-pixel-wide screen, so instead it displays a
240-pixel-wide screen using only the leftmost six columns of each
character cell. The cells are still eight bits wide in memory; the
rightmost two are simply not displayed. This sort of works for some of
the characters — lowercase in particular, which makes me wonder if this
was a consideration during the Tutor’s development — but clearly doesn’t
for others.</p>

I think we’re ready to try it on the real thing!
<p>
I used minipro to dump the current contents of the multicart ROM and
wrote up a little Perl script to do an inplace overwrite on the
resulting file with our new binaries. We generate two ROM files called
<tt>tello.rom</tt> (32 column) and <tt>tello40.rom</tt> (40 column),
which we splice in at locations 0x70000 and 0x74000 and then burn it to
flash.

<p>The multicart DIP settings for the 32-column version are (1=on) 00011
if you use those addresses. The first time I tried, the hello message
appeared but typing generated no output. This was because I had a

instead of <tt>movb r0,<span class="citation"

</div>
Let’s briefly finish our Tutor story. There are in fact two other
members of the Tutor/Pyuuta family, both domestic to Japan: the Pyuuta
Jr., a game console that came out between the Pyuuta and Tutor that
implemented GRAPHIC mode (but no GBASIC) and could play most cartridges
— but was entirely in English with no katakana support at all — and
this, the last and final Tutor, the Pyuuta Mark II (variously Pyuuta mk
II and Mark II). The mk II had proper keycaps with a rearranged layout
and used the American Tutor BIOS instead of the Pyuuta’s, with Tomy
BASIC (also the same as the American Tutor’s version) available as an
add-on cartridge. Notably, neither system supported a composite monitor,
only RF TV output, though they’re pretty easy to comp-mod. Both systems
have slight hardware differences from the Pyuuta and Tutor but both will
run all the same cartridge games, and they also don’t require special
hardware for 32K cartridges. Unfortunately, their English-only nature
probably didn’t endear them to their home markets and the mk II can’t
load Pyuuta tapes either (only US Tutor ones). Likely as a result, both
sold poorly, and Tomy exited the home computer market as well in 1984.
<p>
As for the 9995, in the end it was only ever implemented in three
systems: the Tutor/Pyuuta family, a PEB upgrade called the Myarc Geneve
9640 which was basically a new TI-compatible computer on a card, and the
<a href="http://powertrancortex.com/">Powertran Cortex</a>, a home and
business computer first built at TI in the United Kingdom that never got
released due to internal squabbles. Instead, its plans were published in
the Electronics Today International magazine and a company called
Powertran Cybernetics sold kits and fully assembled machines. The Cortex
ran at a full 3MHz, had 64K of chip RAM (with a memory mapper supporting
up to 1MB) and used a 16K PAL equivalent 9928/29 VDP for graphics,
though the more advanced Yamaha/Maplin V9938 could also be substituted
with up to 128K of VRAM. Floppy, serial and DMA were all supported along
with a built-in BASIC and multiple operating system options, even a
small
<a href="http://www.stuartconner.me.uk/mini_cortex/mini_cortex.htm#using_unix">v6
UNIX port called LSX</a>. Although popular with enthusiasts, it was an
obscure system then and now, and relatively few examples remain in
operation.
<p>
While the 9995 was a much more tractable chip than its ancestors, the
reliance of the 9900 series on RAM was what eventually stunted its
technological evolution. In the days when it was taped out, CPU die
space was expensive, so shifting register space onto cheaper RAM which
often ran at a similar speed was a logical alternative. Indeed, tricks
like 6502/6800 zero page are the same basic idea, using a special
expanse of memory with faster access and special addressing as if it
were CPU registers itself. As CPUs became substantially faster than
memory, however, this architectural quirk became more of a liability and
contemporary 16-bit CPUs like the Motorola 68000 and the Intel 8086 and
80286 eclipsed it. A chip like the 6502 only got away with it for as
long as it did because it was incredibly cheap and incredibly common and
even today still sells in quantity, neither advantage being one the 9900
or 9995 ever possessed. Today, modern CPUs have comparatively massive
register files and caches as proof that the 9900 idea was a dead end.
After the 99000 family, an upgraded 9900 with segmented memory only used
in TI’s last range of minicomputers, TI abandoned further development of
the architecture in 1983 for the TMS320 DSP series and the exceptionally
swift TMS32010, a much more popular (and, especially for a DSP, more
conventional) processor.

id="biden-to-host-japan-pm-kishida-philippines-president-marcos">Biden
to Host Japan PM Kishida, Philippines President Marcos</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden will host Japanese Prime Minister
Fumio Kishida and Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. for a White
House summit next month amid growing concerns about North Korea’s
nuclear program, provocative Chinese action in the South China Sea and
differences over a Japanese company’s plan to buy an iconic American
steel company.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in a statement on
Monday said the first-ever U.S.-Japan-Philippines leaders’ summit is an
opportunity to highlight the countries’ “growing economic relations, a
proud and resolute commitment to shared democratic values and a shared
vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific.”</p>
<p>The three leaders have no shortage of issues to discuss.</p>
<p>The announcement came as North Korea’s state media reported that
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a live-fire drill of
nuclear-capable “super-large” multiple rocket launchers designed to
target South Korea’s capital. The North Korean claim followed the South
Korean and Japanese militaries reporting on Monday that they had
detected North Korea firing multiple short-range ballistic missiles
toward waters off its eastern coast, adding to a streak of weapons
displays that have raised regional tensions.</p>
<p>The U.S.-Japan relationship is facing a rare moment of friction after
Biden announced last week that he opposes the planned sale of
Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel of Japan. Biden argued in
announcing his opposition that the U.S. needs to “maintain strong
American steel companies powered by American steelworkers.”</p>
<p>Nippon Steel announced in December that it planned to buy U.S. Steel
for $14.1 billion in cash, raising concerns about what the transaction
could mean for unionized workers, supply chains and U.S. national
security.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, long-running Philippines-Chinese tensions have come back
into focus this month after Chinese and Philippine coast guard vessels
collided in the disputed South China Sea.</p>
<p>The Chinese coast guard ships and accompanying vessels blocked the
Philippine coast guard and supply vessels off the disputed Second Thomas
Shoal and executed dangerous maneuvers that caused two minor collisions
between the Chinese ships and two of the Philippine vessels, Philippine
officials said.</p>
<p>A small Philippine marine and navy contingent has kept watch onboard
a rusting warship, the BRP Sierra Madre, which has been marooned since
the late 1990s in the shallows of the Second Thomas Shoal.</p>
<p>China also claims the shoal lying off the western Philippines and has
surrounded the atoll with coast guard, navy and other ships to press its
claims and prevent Filipino forces from delivering construction
materials to fortify the Sierra Madre in a decades-long standoff.</p>
<p>Close U.S.-Philippines relations were not a given when Marcos, the
son and namesake of the former Philippines strongman, took office in
2022.</p>
<p>But both Biden and Marcos have thrown much effort into strengthening
the historically- complicated relationship between the two countries,
with the two leaders sharing concerns about aggressive Chinese action
around the region.</p>
<p>A U.S. appeals court in 1996 upheld damages of about $2 billion
against the elder Marcos’ estate for the torture and killings of
thousands of Filipinos. The court upheld a 1994 verdict of a jury in
Hawaii, where he fled after being forced from power in 1986. He died
there in 1989.</p>
<p>The elder Marcos placed the Philippines under martial law in 1972, a
year before his term was to expire. He padlocked the country’s
congressional and newspaper offices, ordered the arrest of many
political opponents and activists and ruled by decree.</p>
<p>The younger Marcos made an official visit to Washington last year,
the first by a Philippine president in more than 10 years. The U.S. made
the announcement of Marcos’ coming trip to Washington as Secretary of
State Antony Blinken visited Manilla.</p>
<p>Jean-Pierre said that in addition to the leaders’ summit Biden will
hold one-on-one talks with Marcos. She said the leaders would discuss
efforts to expand cooperation on economic security, clean energy,
people-to-people ties, human rights and democracy.</p>
<p>Biden is set to honor Kishida a day before the leaders summit with a
state visit. The White House announced the state visit in January.</p>

id="qa-tiktok-owner-is-essentially-subsidiary-of-chinas-communist-party-us-lawmaker-says">Q&amp;A:
TikTok Owner Is Essentially ‘Subsidiary’ of China’s Communist Party, US
Lawmaker Says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill March 13
that, if enacted into law, would give ByteDance, the Chinese owner of
the TikTok social media app, 180 days to divest its U.S. assets or face
a ban over concerns about national security, including Beijing’s ability
to access Americans’ private information through the company</p>
<p>ByteDance denies it would provide such private data to the Chinese
government, despite reports indicating such information could be at
risk.</p>
<p>VOA sat down on the day the bill passed with Republican
Representative Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, chairman of the House
Appropriations subcommittee on state, foreign operations and related
programs, and co-chair of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus, to hear why
he supported the bill and why he’s calling for faster military support
for Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing claims as a breakaway
province that must one day reunite with the mainland, by force if
necessary.</p>
<p>This year marks the 45th anniversary of Congress’ enactment of the
Taiwan Relations Act, which outlines nondiplomatic relations between
Washington and Taipei in the wake of formal U.S. recognition of Beijing
as the government of China. The act states that the U.S. must provide
Taiwan with the means to defend itself.</p>
<p>This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.</p>
<p>VOA: The House just passed a bill that would require ByteDance to
divest TikTok. Did you support this bill?</p>
<p>U.S. Representative Mario Diaz-Balart: I absolutely did. … It has
strong bipartisan support. And there’s also been a lot of misinformation
about it. People say that it’s to ban TikTok. No, it’s basically saying
you have to divest from, in essence, being controlled by the Communist
Party of China.</p>
<p>We would have never allowed, during the Soviet empire, the Soviet
Union to control, to own, one of the major networks in the United States
- ABC, NBC, CBS. Why? Because it’s a threat to national security. In
this case, it’s even more dramatic because they [the Chinese] have
access not only to getting into people’s homes, but to actually get
information from the American people. And they’ve been pretty good and
very aggressive at doing that. And so TikTok needs to be divested.
That’s the least that we should be requiring, and if so, then they can
continue to function. But we cannot allow for this to function, getting
information from the American people to an entity that is in essence a
subsidiary of the Communist Party of China.</p>
<p>VOA: It is a consensus in Washington that if China invaded Taiwan, it
would trigger a domino effect that could be catastrophic for the U.S.
What are the most important actions the U.S. can take right now to
prevent that from happening?</p>
<p>Diaz-Balart: The key is to avoid China doing something stupid, to
avoid China being irresponsible in trying to intervene militarily with
Taiwan. … And the way to do that is to make sure that Taiwan has the
weaponry, everything it needs, so that China understands that trying to
invade Taiwan is a very, very bad proposition.</p>
<p>VOA: The Biden administration last month approved a package of
military equipment sales to Taiwan. Some analysts are worried this may
not be sufficient to counter China’s aggression in the region. Do you
think military sales to Taiwan are sufficient?</p>
<p>Diaz-Balart: I think military sales to Taiwan have to be done
quicker. We have to be more aggressive … not only, obviously, directly,
to help send the weaponry, sell the weaponry, and send the weaponry to
Taiwan, but we also have to keep up with our defense spending
domestically to keep the military industrial base alive and, well, with
what we’ve seen, for example, going on Ukraine, [that] has demonstrated
that we’re not where we need to be as far as our industrial base.</p>
<p>VOA: You visited Taiwan in January right after its election. What is
your key takeaway from that trip?</p>
<p>Diaz-Balart: Taiwan is a very vigorous democracy. The press is very
aggressive. That’s a good thing. … We made a point of obviously visiting
with the president and the vice president-elect, also with the outgoing
president. But we also met with the leadership of the other two parties,
because it’s important to demonstrate that we cherish and that we love
democracy and freedom. Taiwan is a beacon of freedom and democracy.</p>
<p>VOA: It is the bipartisan consensus to see China as one of the
biggest geopolitical challenges for the U.S. in the coming decades. What
should be the top priority the U.S. should tackle right now with
China?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Diaz-Balart: We have to be a little bit more serious about
understanding that China is a very dangerous player in the world. It is
the largest fascist dictatorship on the planet, and the wealthiest
fascist dictatorship on the planet. It has very ambitious goals. It has,
you know, we see the cyberattacks that have taken place in this country
that we know have come from Communist China. We also know that there
have been thousands upon thousands of men, military-age males, coming
from China across the southern border, which should frankly frighten all
of us. …</p>
<p>That means utilizing every diplomatic and economic tool at our
disposal to treat China as what it is: a growing threat to the United
States and to the world. And you see, for example, in the region, how
countries are very concerned about China’s aggressiveness, whether it’s
the Philippines or India or even Vietnam. So there’s a growing concern
in the world about this aggressive attitude of China. But we need to
take real steps to confront that in a way to avoid war.</p>
<p>VOA: You’re also the chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee on state, foreign operations and related programs. What
kind of role would you like to see U.S. international broadcasting
agencies like Voice of America play in countering Chinese Communist
Party propaganda?</p>
<p>Diaz-Balart: The Voice of America has been a key player for decades
in that cause of freedom and in getting real news, real information to
people who don’t have access to it because of censorship. And so I’ve
always been a strong supporter of it because of that. I think
information is key. The first thing that happens in a dictatorship is
that they close the ability for people to get real information, to get
real news. And if we can be helpful to have people around the world get
real information, real news, not only about what happens around the
world but also what even happens in their own country, I think that is a
service to humanity.</p>

Hosts First In-Person Ukraine Defense Contact Group of 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Ramstein, Germany — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Tuesday
that “Russia has paid a staggering cost” for President Vladimir Putin’s
war in Ukraine, as a U.S.-led group of more than 50 nations met in
Germany to coordinate their efforts to support Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Ukraine’s troops face harsh conditions and hard fighting, and
Ukraine’s civilians endure a constant barrage of Russian missiles and
Iranian drones,” Austin said as he opened the Ukraine Defense Contact
Group (UDCG) talks. “But Ukraine won’t back down, and neither will the
United States. So our message today is clear: The United States will not
let Ukraine fail. This coalition will not let Ukraine fail. And the free
world will not let Ukraine fail.”</p>
<p>Austin highlighted new aid packages from the Czech Republic, Germany,
France, Denmark and Sweden, calling them “investments in Ukraine’s just
battle against Russian aggression” as well as global security.</p>
<p>“Ukraine’s survival is on the line, and all of our security is on the
line,” Austin said.</p>
<p>While Ukrainian forces have continued to fight back against Russian
forces in the east and inflicted “considerable damage” to Russian forces
in the Black Sea, Russia — with the help of North Korea and Iran — has
drastically ramped up its defense production capacity, forcing Ukraine
to retreat from some battles due to ammunition shortages, according to a
senior defense official, who spoke to reporters on the condition of
anonymity ahead of the UDCG.</p>
<p>“Ukraine is heavily outgunned on the battlefield. We’ve received
reports of Ukrainian troops rationing or even running out of ammunition
on the front lines,” said the official.</p>
<p>The U.S. has contributed about $44 billion in security assistance for
Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in February 2022, with allies and
partners also committing more than $44 billion in that time frame.</p>
<p>But the U.S. military has run out of congressionally approved funds
for replenishing its weapons stockpiles sent to Ukraine, and leadership
in the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives has so far
refused to bring new aid for Ukraine up for a vote.</p>
<p>Last week, the United States announced its first new round of
military aid for Ukraine since late December, in what defense officials
have called an “ad hoc” package made possible through U.S. Army
procurement savings.</p>
<p>The military assistance package is valued at up to $300 million and
will provide Ukraine with immediate air defense, artillery and anti-tank
capabilities, along with more ammunition for HIMARS and 155-mm artillery
rounds. But officials say it is unclear if there will be future
procurement savings to produce another extraordinary package of aid.</p>
<p>“This is not a sustainable solution for Ukraine. We urgently need
congressional approval of a national security supplemental,” the senior
defense official said.</p>
<p>“There isn’t a way that our allies can really combine forces to make
up for the lack of U.S. support,” the official added.</p>
<p>The emphasis on ammunition and air defense will likely be as strong
as ever during this UDCG meeting.</p>
<p>“They need interceptors for a whole variety of their air defense
systems, and over time, they keep running out as they try to defend
against these wave upon wave of attacks that we’re seeing from Russia,”
the senior official said.</p>
<p>Coalition leadership group</p>
<p>To better organize how the UDCG provides Kyiv with military weapons
and equipment, the group’s members have formed capability coalitions to
identify ways to increase Kyiv’s efficiency and cut costs.    </p>
<p>Austin convened a meeting of the leads and co-leads of all the
capability coalitions for the first time Tuesday, during a special
coalition leadership group session.  </p>
<p>Air Force capability is co-led by the United States, Denmark and the
Netherlands. The armor capability is co-led by Poland and Italy. The
artillery capability is co-led by France and the United States.
De-mining is co-led by Lithuania and Iceland. Drone capability is co-led
by Latvia and the United Kingdom. Information technology is co-led by
Estonia and Luxembourg. Integrated air and missile defense capabilities
are co-led by Germany and France, and maritime security is co-led by the
United Kingdom and Norway.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Critics like Sean McFate, a professor at Syracuse University and
author of “The New Rules of War,” told VOA the international community
is putting its money into expensive military aid that falls short in
modern warfare.</p>
<p>“It’s not conventional warfare that beat back Russia’s blitz. It was
Ukrainian guerrilla warfare,” he said. “Ukraine was winning the
unconventional fight. But then in fall of 2022, they decided to go
conventional against Russia, which was strategically silly.”</p>
<p>McFate added that giving Ukraine more conventional war weapons was,
in his view, “the strategic definition of insanity.”</p>
<p>Instead, he said Ukraine and its allies needed to think about
unconventional ways where they can leverage their power to defeat
Russia, such as guerilla operations and more direct actions deep inside
Russia to build upon the Russian population’s unfavorable opinions of
the war.</p>
<p>“Use your conventional forces to hold the line, but don’t invest them
to create an offensive which requires a lot more resources,” McFate told
VOA.</p>
<p>“M1A1 Abram tanks and F-16 fighter jets … will win tactical victories
on the battlefield, but we all know that you can win every battle, yet
lose the war, because wars are won on the strategic level, not at the
tactical level of warfare,” he said.</p>

Interview: US Says North Korea Shipped 10,000 Containers of Munitions to
Russia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STATE DEPARTMENT — The United States disclosed Monday that North
Korea has dispatched at least 10,000 containers loaded with military
munitions to Russia in support of its war in Ukraine. This number
surpasses the 7,000 containers estimated by the South Korean defense
chief earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Jung Pak, the U.S. Senior Official for the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea (DPRK), told VOA on Monday that there have been at
least 10 instances where North Korean missiles have been used on the
battlefield in Ukraine.</p>
<p>She expressed deep concern about the increasing ties between Russia,
a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and the
DPRK.</p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, North Korea launched several ballistic missiles
into the sea for the first time in two months, as U.S. Secretary of
State Antony Blinken visited Seoul for the Summit for Democracy hosted
by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol.</p>
<p>Despite these “unfortunate” and “concerning” developments, Pak told
VOA the U.S. still assesses North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is not
currently planning an imminent attack on Washington’s allies, South
Korea and Japan.</p>
<p>The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.</p>
<p>VOA: North Korea has fired several ballistic missiles at a time when
South Korea is hosting the Summit for Democracy, and a few days after
the U.S. and South Korea finished their military exercises. Do you still
believe that a direct attack from North Korea against Japan and South
Korea is not imminent?</p>
<p>Jung Pak, U.S. Senior Official for the Democratic People’s Republic
of Korea: I still do. Ballistic missile launches are something that the
DPRK has been doing: 69 in 2022, several dozen last year. And this is
their latest set of launches. And it was unfortunate that they did it
when the secretary was in Seoul for the Summit for Democracy.</p>
<p>We still assess that DPRK’s leader, Kim Jong Un, is not looking at an
imminent attack or near-term attack. I think Kim Jong Un probably knows
what that would likely mean in response. But we are very concerned about
the level of activity, weapons advancements, and the increasing
alignment with Russia over the past couple of years.</p>
<p>VOA: Just to clarify, does the U.S. not see any signs of North Korea
planning some form of lethal military action against South Korea in the
coming months?</p>
<p>Pak: We’re always on the lookout for any kind of dangerous
activities. But I’ll also point out that these ballistic missile tests,
various cruise missile tests, and this hostile rhetoric coming out of
the DPRK, are of great concern to us. Regardless, we’re going to keep
trying to see where we can engage with the DPRK, because diplomacy is
the only way that we can get a sustained peace on the peninsula and
discuss the issue of denuclearization.</p>
<p>VOA: Also on Monday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un congratulated
Russian President Vladimir Putin for his reelection. Meanwhile, South
Korea’s defense chief says North Korea has supplied 7,000 containers
filled with munitions to Russia. Can you talk about the closer ties
between Moscow and Pyongyang?</p>
<p>Pak: It’s been a very concerning development to have a permanent
member of the U.N. Security Council openly flout the Security Council
resolutions that it signed up to, along with the rest of the
international community, and that they’re engaging in weapons transfers.
We know that there have been at least 10,000 containers that have gone
from DPRK to Russia. And DPRK is not doing this for free. There are
almost certainly things that DPRK wants in return. And we’re concerned
about what might be going to the other side.</p>
<p>We also worry about what the DPRK could be learning from Russia’s use
of these weapons and ballistic missiles on the battlefield, and how that
might embolden and/or help the DPRK even further advance their weapons
program. So, this is a really dangerous time.</p>
<p>VOA: Does the U.S. see new evidence that more ballistic missiles
provided by North Korea to Russia have been fired at targets in Ukraine
since 2024?</p>
<p>Pak: Yes, this is of course concerning to us, that we have a known
proliferator in the DPRK selling weapons to Russia, and to be able to
conduct their unlawful brutal attack on Ukraine, killing Ukrainian
people, destroying Ukraine infrastructure, and just destroying lives.
And so, we’re very much concerned about that.</p>
<p>There have been at least 10 instances where the DPRK missiles have
been used on the battlefield. So, we’re absolutely concerned about what
that means for proliferation going forward, and how this exacerbates the
situation.</p>
<p>VOA: Does the U.S. see further evidence that Russia has agreed to and
is helping North Korea with nuclear-capable missiles?</p>
<p>Pak: We think the DPRK is probably looking for ballistic missile
technologies, or other advanced technologies, or surface-to-air
missiles, or armored vehicles. We’ve observed a significant increase in
exchanges across military, leadership, economic, and cultural levels.
So, it’s pretty apparent that the two sides are getting closer and
closer together.</p>
<p>VOA: You have said there would have to be interim steps toward
ultimate denuclearization. Can you please elaborate on that? Is having
“interim steps” to denuclearizing North Korea an official U.S.
government policy?</p>
<p>Pak: Our policy is the same since we rolled out our policy review
back in the spring of 2021, which is that we are absolutely looking for
the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. And so that goal
has not wavered for us at all.</p>
<p>When we talk about “interim steps,” we’re making explicit what has
always been implicit: which is a complete denuclearization will not
occur overnight. So, there are valuable discussions that we can have
with the DPRK on reducing the potential for military risk, and other
substantive discussions as we work toward complete denuclearization.</p>
<p>VOA: Isn’t it a departure from seeking complete denuclearization?</p>
<p>Pak: It is not a departure. As I mentioned, this is not something
that’s going to happen overnight. There are going to have to be
substantial discussions that will need to take place.</p>
