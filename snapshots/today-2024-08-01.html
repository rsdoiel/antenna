<h2 id="a-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-for-mortgage-rates">“A light at
the end of the tunnel” for mortgage rates?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-01, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has set the stage for the central
bank’s first rate cut in four years — but we’ll still likely have to
wait a few weeks. Anticipation of a rate cut has already had ripple
effects across markets, including for mortgage rates. Then, there’s a
shortage of poll workers. What’s being done to boost hiring? Plus, the
Biden administration takes another crack at student loan relief.

<p>
“The number of digital news startup launches has been slowing since 2022
in Europe, Latin America, and North America, according to the new Global
Project Oasis report. Global Project Oasis, a research project funded by
the Google News Initiative that maps digital-native news startups
globally, cited economic challenges, slow growth, and political
conflicts as potential reasons for the drop.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This report is in-depth and fascinating. It seems obvious to me that
having more news sources with specific focuses is a really good thing,
but also that ensuring that they are sustainable is crucial. Many
journalistic outlets were created by journalists with business models as
almost an afterthought, so as certain kinds of funding dried up they
became less viable.
</p>
<p>
One thing that I really wish was present in this report: platform. What
was Substack’s influence here? Or Ghost’s? Are these WordPress shops?
How many of them were aided by Automattic’s Newspack, for example? These
details could also be revealing.
</p>
<p>
We need journalism that keeps us more informed, and it’s not a secret
that many of our incumbent outlets are not doing the job. A healthy news
startup ecosystem is one way we can get to a more informed voting
population and stronger democracies in our local communities,
nationally, and globally.

<h2 id="serpent-os-prealpha0-released">Serpent OS prealpha0
released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Serpent OS, a new Linux distribution with a completely custom package
management system written in Rust, has released its very very rough
pre-alpha release. They’ve been working on this for four years, and
they’re making some interesting choices regarding packaging that I
really like, at least on paper. This will of course appear to be a very
rough (crap) prealpha ISO. Underneath the surface it is using the moss
package manager, our very own package management solution written in
Rust. Quite simply, every single transaction in moss generates a new
filesystem tree (/usr) in a staging area as a full, stateless, OS
transaction. When the package installs succeed, any transaction triggers
are run in a private namespace (container) before finally activating the
new /usr tree. Through our enforced stateless design, usr-merge, etc, we
can atomically update the running OS with a single renameat2 call. As a
neat aside, all OS content is deduplicated, meaning your last system
transaction is still available on disk allowing offline rollbacks. ↫
Ikey Doherty Since this is only a very rough pre-alpha release, I don’t
have much more to say at this point, but I do think it’s interesting
enough to let y’all know about it. Even if you’re not the kind of person
to dive into pre-alphas, I think you should keep an eye on Serpent OS,
because I have a feeling they’re on to something valuable here.</p>

<h2 id="the-impact-of-ai-on-computer-science-education">The impact of AI
on computer science education</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Yesterday I highlighted a study that found that AI and ML, and the
expectations around them, are actually causing people to need to work
harder and more, instead of less. Today, I have another study for you,
this time focusing a more long-term issue: when you use something like
ChatGPT to troubleshoot and fix a bug, are you actually learning
anything? A professor at MIT divided a group of students into three, and
gave them a programming task in a language they did not know (FORTRAN).
One group was allowed to use ChatGPT to solve the problem, the second
group was told to use Meta’s Code Llama large language model (LLM), and
the third group could only use Google. The group that used ChatGPT,
predictably, solved the problem quickest, while it took the second group
longer to solve it. It took the group using Google even longer, because
they had to break the task down into components. Then, the students were
tested on how they solved the problem from memory, and the tables
turned. The ChatGPT group “remembered nothing, and they all failed,”
recalled Klopfer, a professor and director of the MIT Scheller Teacher
Education Program and The Education Arcade. Meanwhile, half of the Code
Llama group passed the test. The group that used Google? Every student
passed. ↫ Esther Shein at ACM I find this an interesting result, but at
the same time, not a very surprising one. It reminds me a lot of that
when I went to high school, I was part of the first generation whose
math and algebra courses were built around using a graphic calculator.
Despite being able to solve and graph complex equations with ease thanks
to our TI-83, we were, of course, still told to include our “work”, the
steps taken to get from the question to the answer, instead of only
writing down the answer itself. Since I was quite good “at computers”,
and even managed to do some very limited programming on the TI-83, it
was an absolute breeze for me to hit some buttons and get the right
answers – but since I knew, and know, absolutely nothing about math, I
couldn’t for the life of me explain how I got to the answers. Using
ChatGPT to fix your programming problem feels like a very similar thing.
Sure, ChatGPT can spit out a workable solution for you, but since you
aren’t aware of the steps between problem and solution, you aren’t
actually learning anything. By using ChatGPT, you’re not actually
learning how to program or how to improve your skills – you’re just
hitting the right buttons on a graphing calculator and writing down
what’s on the screen, without understanding why or how. I can totally
see how using ChatGPT for boring boilerplate code you’ve written a
million times over, or to point you in the right direction while still
coming up with your own solution to a problem, can be a good and helpful
thing. I’m just worried about a degradation in skill level and code
quality, and how society will, at some point, pay the price for
that.</p>

Energy Developers Eye Interest Rate Relief</h2>

<em><strong><em>Current conditions: </em></strong></em><em>192 people
are still missing after heavy rains set off a torrent of flash floods in
the Indian state of Kerala • Spain’s heat wave is believed to have
peaked after an observatory near Barcelona recorded an all-time high •
Temperatures in Antarctica soar to more than 50˚F above normal.</em>
</p>
<h2>
THE TOP FIVE
</h2>
<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>A September rate cut could bring relief to renewable energy
developers
</h3>
<p>
The Federal Reserve once again voted to hold interest rates steady at
5.3% but signaled that a rate cut could arrive as soon as September.
That rate cut would be music to the ears of renewable energy developers,
who have
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/fed-interest-rate-renewables" target="_self"><u>struggled
to cope</u></a> with higher borrowing costs. Compared to fossil fuels,
renewable energy is more vulnerable to interest rate changes because
upfront capital expenditures comprise a greater share of the total
project cost.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/federal-reserve-climate-change-inflation" target="_self"><u>As
Joel Dodge wrote for Heatmap in March</u></a>, high interest rates have
hit the offshore wind industry particularly hard, contributing to cost
overruns and even cancellations.
</p>
<p>
In a press conference on Wednesday, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell
cited “further progress” towards the Fed’s goal of 2% inflation. “A
reduction in our policy rate could be on the table” for the September
meeting, said Powell. Renewable developers will certainly hope so.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Senate energy permitting bill passes through committee
</h3>
<p>
The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee approved a bipartisan
energy permitting bill in a 15-4 vote on Wednesday. The bill has a
little something for everyone: sped-up permitting for renewable energy,
requirements for oil and gas leases, and LNG approval time limits. It’s
a joint effort by Republican Senator John Barrasso and Independent
Senator Joe Manchin, who effused that the bill’s passage marked “a
tremendous day for all of us.” Critics of the bill
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/permitting-deal-climate-opposition" target="_self"><u>include
over 360 environmental groups</u></a>, who view the fossil fuel
provisions as an affront to climate action. Three Democratic-caucusing
senators and one Republican senator have already signaled that they will
oppose the legislation. The White House has yet to weigh in, though
senior climate policymakers have
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/ceraweek-podesta-permitting-push-climate-kerry-lng-spat/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>previously
said</u></a> that permitting reform is necessary to unlock the benefits
of the Inflation Reduction Act.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Global battery investment declines for the first time this decade
</h3>
<p>
After growing for four years straight, global investment in batteries is
set to decline this year,
<a href="https://www.rystadenergy.com/news/global-battery-investments" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according
to analytics firm Rystad Energy</u></a>. The main culprit, Rystad says,
is a slump in the Chinese market, where industry consolidation and
supply chain constraints have put a damper on the firehose of investment
that marked 2021 and 2022. If the spending dip bears out, it could pose
challenges for the global EV industry. Sustained technological
improvements and cost declines – largely driven by Chinese investments –
have made EVs more affordable and driven their adoption in Asian and
Western markets alike.
</p>
<p>
What this means for the future of the battery industry is unclear, says
Duo Fu, Rystad’s vice president for battery market research. He noted
that “collaboration across the entire supply chain is crucial for the
industry’s health.”
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Grid-enhancing technology gets a raise
</h3>
<p>
TS Conductor closed a $60 million growth investment round,
<a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/ts-conductor-raises-60-million-from-industry-leading-investors-to-expand-us-production-of-high-capacity-power-lines-302207238.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
company announced on Wednesday</u></a>. The U.S.-based manufacturer of
advanced power lines plans to use the money to open a second production
facility, with its Southern California plant nearly at capacity. TS’s
power lines offer an upgrade on the traditional stock by decreasing line
losses, reducing sag, and accommodating up to triple the power during
peak generation hours.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/100-percent-clean-electricity-by-2035-study.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The
National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that transmission
capacity will have to nearly triple by 2035</u></a> if the U.S. is to
integrate the renewable energy required to meet its climate goals.
Transmission lines, however, are notoriously costly and time-intensive
to build. Grid-enhancing technologies like TS’s can
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/clean-energy-grid-reconductoring" target="_self"><u>ease
the burden</u></a> on new construction by allowing grid operators to
increase the capacity of their existing lines.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>BYD and Uber strike a deal
</h3>
<p>
Uber has announced that it will purchase 100,000 EVs from Chinese auto
company BYD as part of an effort to shift Uber’s fleet of vehicles to
electric. Uber drivers will be offered a host of discounts – on things
like leasing, charging, and maintenance – to encourage them to make the
jump to an EV. The vehicles will hit the streets first in Europe and
Latin America, with Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the Middle East
further down the road.
</p>
<p>
The deal comes as political leaders in the United States and Europe
scramble to stem the flow of low-cost Chinese EVs over worries that they
will outcompete Western manufacturers. In May, the Biden administration
announced that it would impose a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs, and
European lawmakers imposed their own tariff (albeit smaller) on the cars
in July.
</p>
<h2>
<span></span>THE KICKER
</h2>
<p>
<em><strong><em></em></strong></em>$120 billion — that’s the total cost
of natural disasters in the first half of 2024, according to German
insurance company Munich Re. It’s a slight decrease from the same period
last year, but still well above the average for the past three decades.

<h2 id="young-fencer-shows-ny-grit-on-paris-2024-stage">Young fencer
shows NY grit on Paris 2024 stage</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>EAUBONNE, France — Growing up in cutthroat New York gave Lauren
Scruggs the competitive mindset needed to claim an unexpected fencing
silver medal on her Olympic debut in Paris.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old Queens native shared the podium with fellow American
Lee Kiefer, who retained her Olympic title in the women’s individual
foil event gold medal bout on Sunday.</p>
<p>“I’ve grown up in New York my whole life. It can be kind of rough
sometimes,” Scruggs, the first Black American fencer to win an Olympic
medal in a women’s individual event, told Reuters.</p>
<p>“You develop a hard shell, and in terms of how that translates to my
fencing, I think it came out, that energy and that toughness.”</p>
<p>When Scruggs found herself neck-and-neck with then world No. 2
Arriana Errigo in the quarterfinals, she managed to score the last
touch, knocking out the Italian 15-14.</p>
<p>“I think that was my toughest bout of the day in terms of energy, and
going past my limits, and I have definitely New York to thank for that,”
said Scruggs, one of the rare Black fencers at the highest level.</p>
<p>“Fencing is predominantly white, I think for a multitude of reasons,
it’s just the history of the sport, and the lack of representation and
encouragement,” she explained.</p>
<p>“To have this accomplishment is a big deal for me, because when I was
younger I only had a few people to look up to in the sport, so to be
someone that little kids now can look up to is very special to me.”</p>
<p>They can draw inspiration from her impressive grit, which coach Sean
McClain described in the U.S. training venue in Eaubonne, in the
outskirts of Paris, saying that since she was eight, Scruggs only cared
about winning medals.</p>
<p>“And she’s maintained that distaste for losing her entire career,” he
said. “I really think in an event like the Olympics, it’s more about how
you compete.”</p>
<p>Expensive sport</p>
<p>Born in the U.S. to Jamaican immigrants, Scruggs grew up in Queens
with her mother and grandmother.</p>
<p>“I was in a single-parent household early on, so my family had to
basically cut some corners around here and there to support us,” said
Scruggs, whose brother was the first to get into fencing and inspired
her to take up the sport.</p>
<p>Now a college student at Harvard, where she trains every day, Scruggs
had to fight to make it into a “pretty expensive” sport.</p>
<p>“It was not easy growing up, trying to fence while being from where
I’m from, just income-wise,” she said.</p>
<p>“If you have the funds, it makes it a lot easier to pursue the sport
and feel comfortable asking that from your family.</p>
<p>“But if you’re coming from a lower-income background, it might push
you harder. And I think it’s what happened with me. I just wanted it
more than my peers.”</p>
<p>On paper, Scruggs did not have a big medal chance, but she showed her
mettle at the Grand Palais arena.</p>
<p>“Fencing skill wise, Lauren is on par with the better fencers in the
world, but she’s not better than them. What made the difference was that
competitiveness,” said McClain, who has also become Scruggs’
stepfather.</p>
<p>“That comes from my wife,” he added. “I knew it was possible, but I
didn’t really think Lauren was going to win a medal in her first
Olympics. But my wife did. She was like, she’d better win a medal. So
that’s where it comes from – that’s the fiery spirit!”</p>
<p>With Kiefer and alongside teammates Jackie Dubrovich and Maia
Weintraub, Scruggs will represent the U.S. against China on Thursday in
the quarterfinals of the women’s foil team event.</p>
<p>Scruggs is aiming for gold this time and is dreaming already of
qualifying for the next Games, which will take place in Los Angeles in
four years’ time.</p>
<p>“I can’t imagine myself not fencing,” she said. “It’s not even love,
it’s just a part of me. It’s connected to who I am,” she said.</p>

id="harris-says-trumps-false-claims-about-race-same-old-show-of-divisiveness-disrespect">Harris
says Trump’s false claims about race same old show’ of divisiveness,
disrespect</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris said Wednesday that former
President Donald Trump’s false assertions about her race were the “same
old show” as she emphasized the need for Black women to organize for his
defeat this November.</p>
<p>Addressing the Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority Inc. — one of “Divine Nine”
historically Black fraternities and sororities — in Houston, Harris told
the crowd, “When I look out at everyone here, I see family.”</p>
<p>She drew knowing chuckles from the audience as she mentioned Trump’s
comments earlier in the day at the annual meeting of the National
Association of Black Journalists. Trump said Harris, the first Black
woman and Asian American to serve as vice president, had in the past
promoted only her Indian heritage.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she
happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black. So, I
don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?” Trump said while addressing
the NABJ in Chicago.</p>
<p>Harris responded briefly during her address to the sorority, saying
Trump’s display was “the same old show: the divisiveness and the
disrespect.”</p>
<p>She added: “And let me just say, the American people deserve better.
The American people deserve better.”</p>
<p>“Our differences do not divide us, they are an essential source of
our strength,” Harris said.</p>
<p>Referencing the combative tone of Trump’s interview at the NABJ
convention, she said, “The American people deserve a leader who tells
the truth, a leader who does not respond with hostility and anger when
confronted with the facts.”</p>
<p>Harris is the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother,
both immigrants to the U.S. As an undergraduate, Harris attended Howard
University, one of the nation’s most prominent historically Black
colleges and universities, where she also pledged the historically Black
sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha. As a U.S. senator, Harris was a member of
the Congressional Black Caucus.</p>
<p>Speaking to Sigma Gamma Rho members, Harris said, “Our nation is
counting on you” to register people to vote and ensure they go to the
polls. “When we organize, mountains move,” she said.</p>
<p>Black Greek life is often seen as a lifelong involvement, leading
many members to return to regular gatherings — or “boulés” in the
organizations’ phrasing — that gather tens of thousands of members each.
Harris has attended three such events in the last month, including the
boulé for her own sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha.</p>
<p>The Divine Nine organizations, which are officially apolitical,
emphasize public service as a mission and have deep networks in
politics, business and media.</p>
<p>June Penny, 66, of Georgia, an attendee at Harris’ speech in Houston,
said Trump’s comments about Harris’ race reminded her of how he tried to
discredit then-President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>“I’m not surprised he would try to find something like that,” Penny
said.</p>
<p>She said Trump’s views don’t reflect the reality of race in the
country, noting, “I have biracial grandchildren” — her son-in-law is
white — “and the world views them as Black.”</p>
<p>More than 30 members of Congress are affiliated with a Black Greek
letter organization. Close advisers to President Joe Biden, including
Stephen Benjamin, Cedric Richmond and Keisha Lance Bottoms, are members
of Divine Nine organizations. Harris has welcomed such connections to
staff her operation and build her own network in Washington.</p>

<h2 id="china-sanctions-us-lawmaker">China sanctions US lawmaker</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — China issued sanctions on U.S. Representative Jim
McGovern, the sponsor of a bill advocating for a peaceful resolution of
the China-Tibet dispute China views Tibet as an “inseparable part of
China since ancient times,” despite supporters of the Tibetan Government
in Exile and the Dalai Lama saying that Tibet has historically been
independent.</p>
<p>Framed as a response to McGovern’s efforts to undermine Chinese
territorial sovereignty, the sanctions freeze the representative’s
Chinese assets, prohibit organizations or individuals in China from
engaging with him, and ban him and his family from entering Chinese
territory, according to a publication from Chinese state-media agency
Xinhua.</p>
<p>McGovern has no assets or business dealings in China, according to
The Associated Press.</p>
<p>McGovern’s Tibet-China Dispute Act, which passed through the House in
mid-June, gives the State Department increased authority to counter
Chinese disinformation about Tibet and promotes the resumption of talks
between Chinese leaders and the Dalai Lama. No such talks have occurred
since 2010.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden signed the legislation into law on July 12.</p>
<p>China stands accused of large-scale human rights abuses in Tibet,
which the congressman hoped to alleviate with this legislation.</p>
<p>McGovern’s office did not respond to a VOA request for comment.</p>
<p>In a statement released on June 12 when the bill passed the House,
McGovern said, “The People’s Republic of China has systematically denied
Tibetans the right to self-determination and continues to deliberately
erase Tibetan religion, culture, and language.”</p>
<p>“The ongoing oppression of the Tibetan people is a grave tragedy, and
our bill provides further tools that empower both America and the
international community to stand up for justice and peace,” he said.</p>
<p>Among the signees of the statement were House Foreign Affairs
Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, Senator Todd Young, McGovern and
Senator Jeff Merkley.</p>
<p>In a response, Chinese state-sponsored media Xinhua said the
Tibet-China Dispute Act “grossly interferes in China’s internal
affairs,” violates international law and distorts historical facts to
suppress China and encourage Tibetan separatist movements.</p>
<p>This is not the first time China has sanctioned a U.S. representative
for their involvement in an issue that threatens Chinese territorial
homogeneity. Over the last year, China has sanctioned both
Representative McCaul and former Representative Mike Gallagher over
their support for Taiwan.</p>

id="judge-oks-settlement-in-lawsuit-over-us-detention-of-iraqi-nationals">Judge
OKs settlement in lawsuit over US detention of Iraqi nationals</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DETROIT — A judge approved a settlement Wednesday in a 2017 lawsuit
that challenged the detention of Iraqi nationals who were targeted for
deportation during the Trump administration.</p>
<p>The agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE,
sets strict conditions for future detentions before any proposed
removals, the American Civil Liberties Union said.</p>
<p>“Too often, immigrants are locked up for months or years for
absolutely no reason other than they want what so many of us have
already: the chance to build a life in America. The settlement will make
it easier for them to do that,” ACLU attorney Miriam Aukerman said.</p>
<p>An email seeking comment from ICE was not immediately answered.</p>
<p>The lawsuit involved about 1,400 people, many of whom had been
allowed to stay in the U.S. for years, holding jobs and raising
families, because Iraq had no interest in taking them back.</p>
<p>That suddenly changed in 2017 when Iraq’s position apparently
shifted. ICE arrested people around the U.S., especially in southeastern
Michigan, and detained them based on old deportation orders. Some were
in custody for more than a year. Protesters filled streets outside the
federal courthouse in Detroit.</p>
<p>The ACLU argued that their lives would be at risk if they were
returned to their native country. The goal of the lawsuit was to suspend
deportations and allow people to at least return to immigration court to
make arguments about safety threats in Iraq.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith made key rulings in their favor.
Although those decisions were reversed by a higher court in 2018, there
were opportunities in the meantime to win release and get into
immigration court because of Goldsmith’s orders.</p>
<p>Some people were granted asylum or became U.S. citizens. Roughly 50
people who were being held by ICE decided to go back to Iraq, Aukerman
said.</p>
<p>“They were so distraught about being in detention, they just gave
up,” she said. “The vast majority remain in the United States. … What

arrests a former Green Beret over the failed 2020 raid into Venezuela to
remove Maduro</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CARACAS, Venezuela — A former U.S. Green Beret who in 2020 organized
a failed cross-border raid of Venezuelan army deserters to remove
President Nicolas Maduro has been arrested in New York on federal arms
smuggling charges.</p>
<p>A federal indictment unsealed this week in Tampa, Florida, accuses
Jordan Goudreau and a Venezuelan partner, Yacsy Alvarez, of violating
U.S. arms control laws when they allegedly assembled and sent to
Colombia AR-styled weapons, ammunition, silencers, night vision goggles
and other defense equipment requiring a U.S. export license.</p>
<p>Goudreau, 48, also was charged with conspiracy, smuggling goods from
the United States and unlawful possession of a machine gun, among 14
counts. Goudreau appeared in federal court following his Tuesday arrest
in Manhattan, but it was not clear a day later whether he would be
released from custody pending trial. He was being held at a federal
detention center in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Goudreau, a three-time Bronze Star recipient for bravery in Iraq and
Afghanistan, claimed responsibility in 2020 for the amphibious raid by a
ragtag group of soldiers that had trained in clandestine camps in
Venezuela’s neighbor Colombia. He said he and others were acting to
protect Venezuela’s democracy after Maduro’s 2018 reelection was
boycotted by the opposition and condemned as undemocratic by the U.S.
and dozens of other countries.</p>
<p>Two days before the incursion, The Associated Press published an
investigation detailing how Goudreau had been trying for months to raise
funds for the harebrained idea from the Trump administration,
Venezuela’s opposition and wealthy Americans looking to invest in
Venezuela’s oil industry should Maduro be removed.</p>
<p>While then-opposition leader Juan Guaidó was initially enthused by
the coup idea, signing an agreement with Goudreau to explore such an
option, little financial support arrived and the rural homes along
Colombia’s Caribbean coast that housed the would-be liberators suffered
from a lack of food, weapons and other supplies.</p>
<p>Despite the setbacks, the coup plotters went forward in a comical if
tragic way in what was widely ridiculed as the “Bay of Piglets,” in
reference to the 1961 Cuban fiasco. The group was easily mopped up by
Venezuela’s security forces, which had already infiltrated the group.
Two of Goudreau’s former Green Beret colleagues spent years in
Venezuela’s prisons until a prisoner swap last year with other jailed
Americans for a Maduro ally held in the U.S. on money laundering
charges.</p>
<p>The arrest comes as Maduro is once again facing pressure over his
increasingly authoritarian moves. Election authorities declared him the
winner of Sunday’s presidential vote but a growing chorus of nations
refuse to recognize the results, demanding Venezuela release individual
precinct tallies. The opposition has presented records from 80% of the
polling booths showing that its candidate, Edmundo González, defeated
Maduro by a two-to-one margin.</p>
<p>Prosecutors in their 22-page indictment of Goudreau documented the
ill-fated plot, citing text messages between the defendants about their
effort to buy military-related equipment and export it to Colombia, and
tracing a web of money transfers, chartered flights and large-scale
purchases.</p>
<p>One November 2019 message from Goudreau to an equipment distributor
said: “Here is the list bro.” It included AR-15 rifles, night-vision
devices and ballistic helmets, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>“We def need our guns,” Goudreau wrote in one text message, according
to the indictment. Prosecutors said he also identified a storage unit in
Phoenix where an unnamed associate — who the AP has learned was another
former Green Beret — would pick up the ammo.</p>
<p>In another message, prosecutors said, Alvarez asked Goudreau if she
would be “taking things” with her on an upcoming flight from the U.S. to
Colombia.</p>
<p>The equipment was shipped to Miami. Separately, Goudreau purchased
several components to assemble about 60 AR-type firearms. Prosecutors
said he also spent $90,000 on a used yacht — named Silverpoint,
according to AP reporting — that left U.S. waters in February 2020 with
Goudreau, an associate and several cans of ammunition, body armor plates
and magazines for AR-15 rifles.</p>
<p>A month later, Colombian police found at a checkpoint near the
Caribbean city of Santa Marta the stockpiled gear in the back of a car
hired by Alvarez. From there, the plot — or at least Goudreau’s
involvement in it — quickly unraveled.</p>
<p>Alvarez was an associate of a Venezuelan businessman who was so close
to the government of the late Hugo Chávez that he spent almost four
years in a U.S. prison for trying to cover up clandestine cash payments
to its allies.</p>
<p>Franklin Duran was also the owner of the Venezuela-registered Cessna
Citation II that was sometimes used to transport Alvarez and Goudreau,
an AP investigation found. Duran over two decades has had numerous
business ties with the socialist government of Venezuela, making him an
odd choice to help a band of would-be-mercenaries overthrow Maduro. He
was arrested in 2020 by Maduro for his involvement in the plot.</p>
<p>The U.S. indictment makes no mention of Duran but does say that in
furtherance of the conspiracy, Goudreau, Alvarez and unnamed others
traveled at least three times on a private airplane between Miami’s
Opa-Locka airport and the Colombian city of Barranquilla, where Alvarez
and Goudreau registered a Colombian affiliate of his Melbourne,
Florida-based company Silvercorp.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Goudreau’s main partner in the would-be coup,
Cliver Alcalá, a retired three-star Venezuelan army general, was
sentenced in Manhattan federal court to more than two decades for
providing weapons to drug-funded rebels in an unrelated case.</p>
<p>Goudreau attended the court proceedings and wrote a letter praising
Alcalá, as a freedom-loving patriot who deserved to have his sentence
reduced. But he refused then and on other occasions to speak to AP about
his role in the attempted coup. His attorney, Gustavo J. Garcia-Montes,
said his client is innocent but declined further comment.</p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department declined to comment. An attorney for
Alvarez, Christopher A. Kerr, told AP that Alvarez is “seeking asylum in
the United States and has been living here peacefully with other family
members, several of whom are U.S. citizens.”</p>
<p>“She will plead not guilty to these charges this afternoon, and as of
right now, under our system, they are nothing more than
allegations.”</p>
<p>If convicted, Goudreau and Alvarez face between 5 and 20 years in
prison for each of the violations in the indictment.</p>

id="new-yorkers-increasingly-seek-in-person-social-events-over-online-connections">New
Yorkers increasingly seek in-person social events over online
connections</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — Over 8 million people live in New York City and yet
lasting romantic relationships can still seem hard to come by.</p>
<p>Because of this, many singles in the city have ditched swiping on
dating apps for socializing in real life through in-person events such
as running clubs, reading parties and singles meetups.</p>
<p>In the early 2010s, dating apps such as Tinder and Hinge became a
prominent way to meet potential partners, and though they have produced
countless successful love stories, many New York City singles are
beginning to grow weary of them.</p>
<p>“I think there’s some disenchantment with dating apps overall. A
feeling like they’re an option, but maybe not the best option,” said
Kathryn Coduto, assistant professor of media science at Boston
University and dating researcher. “An in-person meeting, a group maybe,
where there’s similar interests, allows people to connect in person and
have that initial conversation without the phone as an
intermediary.”</p>
<p>Dating app fatigue paired with recent years of COVID-19 isolation has
contributed to a recent upward trend of in-person social events.
According to Eventbrite, in-person dating activities in the United
States saw a 42% increase in attendance from 2022 to 2023.</p>
<p>Amber Soletti, founder of in-person singles dating event company
Single and the City, has seen this trend, too, noting that her business
is up 67% in event attendance from a year ago.</p>
<p>“People have this app fatigue, this swipe fatigue,” Soletti said.
“They are ready to go back to in-person events and make authentic
connections with people in real life.”</p>
<p>This is exactly the goal of the viral Lunge Run Club, a running club
based in Manhattan targeted toward singles looking for love.</p>
<p>Founded earlier this year by Steve Cole and Rachael Lansing, the club
meets every Wednesday in Manhattan for a 5-kilometer run followed by
drinks at a bar. Lunge Run Club started with only 30 people and has
since taken the city by storm, raking in hundreds of attendees each
week.</p>
<p>The club encourages people to wear black if single and colors if
taken, hoping to take some of the mystery and fear out of in-person
dating events.</p>
<p>“People always use run clubs or recreational sports, anything like
that, as a way to meet people,” Lansing said. “We kind of just took away
that mask of, ‘I’m going and maybe I’ll meet someone’ and now it’s the
intentional, ‘I’m showing up. I’m wearing all black. I’m saying I’m
single. I’m looking to either meet some great friends or someone
special.’”</p>
<p>Lunge Run Club is not alone in its mission, but rather a part of a
movement of people seeking connection in one of the largest cities in
the world. Soletti’s Single and the City hosts speed dating events and
specialized singles mixers focused on shared interests, hobbies or even
physical characteristics, such as height.</p>
<p>“Having something in common is a great starting point for a
relationship, and that could be a friendship, but could also be a
romantic relationship,” Coduto said. “That makes a lot of sense when you
have something in common with someone, it gives you something to talk
about.”</p>
<p>While Lunge Run Club and Single and the City are specifically
marketed as dating scenes, other events are more broadly focused on
facilitating community in general.</p>
<p>In June 2023, Ben Bradbury, Tom Worcester, Charlotte Jackson and John
Lifrieri founded Reading Rhythms, “reading parties” during which people
meet at various venues to read and socialize, helping people build
community, friendships and possibly even more.</p>
<p>Bradbury explained how in-person interactions, such as those at
Reading Rhythms, can facilitate connection in a way that cannot always
be replicated online.</p>
<p>“Authentic connection, you can’t fake it when you’re in person. It’s
either authentic or it’s not,” Bradbury said. “I think people are really
enjoying that, that feeling of having people together and, also, just
remembering what it’s like to connect in person. I think society is
really wanting that right now.”</p>
<p>Despite not necessarily being advertised as a place to find romantic
love, Reading Rhythms has seen an outpouring of support and engagement
similar to Lunge Run Club and Single and the City’s events. Reading
Rhythms has hosted over 120 parties with 7,500 readers looking for an
in-person connection over a shared interest.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to feel someone’s energy when you just see them online. I
think with this day and age of social media, and curating our online
presence, you get one layer of who someone is,” said Nikki D’Ambrosio,
host and longtime participant of Reading Rhythms. “What I love about
Reading Rhythms is it’s not just, ‘Hi, my name is Nikki and this is what
book I’m reading.’ It’s really going deeper.”</p>
<p>From running to reading to speed dating, people are yearning for
in-person connection and New York City has countless opportunities to
offer.</p>

id="analysts-question-if-russian-political-prisoner-movements-signal-imminent-swap">Analysts
question if Russian political prisoner movements signal imminent
swap</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The movement inside Russia of several high-profile
political prisoners in recent days is fueling speculation that a
prisoner swap with Western countries may be close.</p>
<p>Lawyers and relatives of at least eight individuals say they seem to
have been moved from detention facilities across Russia. Those detained
had been jailed for criticizing the Kremlin or spreading what Moscow
views as false information about the Russian military.</p>
<p>At the same time, legal action by Belarus and Slovenia on foreign
nationals has added to speculation in Western media that a multicountry
swap, potentially involving Russia, the United States and Germany, may
be in the works.</p>
<p>Among those detained in Russia whose location is currently unknown
are former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan; British Russian activist and
journalist Vladimir Kara-Murza, who contributes to The Washington Post;
and Liliya Chanysheva, who worked closely with late opposition leader
Alexey Navalny.</p>
<p>Whelan is serving a 16-year prison sentence on espionage charges that
he denies. His lawyer told the Interfax news agency she cannot contact
him, adding, “There are rumors of a possible exchange.”</p>
<p>The Post reported late Wednesday that prison officials had confirmed
Kara-Murza had been moved from a prison colony but would not say where
he was taken. The columnist is serving a 25-year prison sentence after
being accused of treason because he criticized Russia’s war in
Ukraine.</p>
<p>While some analysts believe the disappearances may be a sign of an
imminent prisoner swap, others, like Russia expert Keir Giles, are more
skeptical.</p>
<p>“We need to bear in mind that the people that we see reported are
only the tip of the iceberg, and there are so many others that don’t get
that worldwide media attention,” Giles, who works at the British think
tank Chatham House, told VOA.</p>
<p>“To be disappeared within the system for a period of days or weeks or
even longer is not that unusual,” Giles added. “It’s hard to tell what
within the Russian prison system is deliberate cruelty and what is
simply the result of inefficiency and incompetence, but the net effect,
of course, on the victims is exactly the same.”</p>
<p>Navalny, for instance, was abruptly moved in secret from a prison in
central Russia to one above the Arctic Circle in December 2023. The move
took 20 days, Giles said. The opposition leader died at the prison in
February.</p>
<p>Russia’s Foreign Ministry and Washington embassy did not immediately
reply to VOA’s emails requesting comment for this story.</p>
<p>Other political prisoners missing this past week include German
Russian citizen Kevin Lik; opposition activist Ksenia Fadeeva; anti-war
artist Sasha Skochilenko; and critical politician Ilya Yashin.</p>
<p>The online Russian media outlet Agenstvo reported that at least six
special Russian government planes had flown to and from the regions
where some of these prisoners were located. VOA could not immediately
verify that.</p>
<p>Their disappearances come on the heels of other developments.</p>
<p>In Belarus on Tuesday, President Alexander Lukashenko unexpectedly
pardoned Rico Krieger, a German who had been sentenced to death on
terrorism charges. Belarus and Russia are close allies.</p>
<p>And on Wednesday, a Slovenian court sentenced two Russians to time
served for espionage and said they would be deported to Russia.</p>
<p>Sergei Davidis doesn’t think the timing can be a coincidence. He is
the head of the Political Prisoners Support Program and a member of the
board at the Russian human rights group Memorial.</p>
<p>Memorial’s co-chair, Oleg Orlov, is among the political prisoners to
recently vanish.</p>
<p>“It seems that there is no other reasonable explanation than
expectations of some swap,” Davidis told VOA from the Lithuanian
capital, Vilnius.  </p>
<p>He added that Russian President Vladimir Putin would need to pardon
those involved in any potential swap as a formality.</p>
<p>The Daily Beast reported that the swap would take place in Ankara,
Turkey, and that a “second part” would potentially occur in Doha.</p>
<p>Putin has previously signaled he would be willing to trade Wall
Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich for a Russian man named Vadim
Krasikov, who is serving a life sentence in Germany for killing a
Chechen dissident in Berlin.</p>
<p>Gershkovich is one of two American journalists imprisoned in Russia.
The other is Alsu Kurmasheva. Both were convicted in secret trials on
July 19 on charges that are widely viewed as bogus.</p>
<p>Russia state media, meanwhile, reported that four Russians jailed in
the United States had disappeared from a database of prisoners that the
U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons operates. It named them as Alexander
Vinnik, Maxim Marchenko, Vadim Konoshchenko and Vladislav Klyushin.</p>
<p>Commenting on remarks made by Putin earlier this year about a
possible swap for Gershkovich, Giles said, “It is not a process that is
pretending particularly hard to be legitimate. It’s just a
straightforward extortion.” </p>
<p>The United States and Russia have been engaging in prisoner swap
negotiations for months.</p>
<p>“The United States continues to be focused on working around the
clock to work to get our wrongfully detained American citizens home,”
State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told VOA at a
Wednesday press briefing.</p>
<p>When asked about any updates on a potential prisoner swap, Patel said
he had no updates.</p>
<p>Prisoner swaps are typically cloaked in secrecy.</p>
<p>Although the U.S. government has previously faced criticism for
exchanging legitimate Russian criminals for innocent Americans, hostage
advocate Diane Foley maintained that it is Washington’s duty to do
everything it can to protect its citizens.</p>
<p>“They need to have the moral clarity to recognize that their
citizen’s life is their responsibility. It’s their responsibility to do
all they can to prioritize that life,” Foley told VOA.</p>
<p>Foley founded the Foley Foundation after the abduction and killing in
Syria of her son, American journalist James Foley, in 2014. She says the
U.S. has made some improvements in assisting families, but the burden
still largely falls on relatives whose loved ones are unjustly held
abroad.</p>
<p>Since launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia has
cracked down hard on anything perceived as criticism of the Kremlin,
leading to the arrests of scores of activists and journalists. In late
2023, rights group Memorial estimated there were nearly 1,000 political
prisoners jailed in Russia.</p>
<p>The biggest prisoner swap since the Cold War occurred in 2010 and
included 14 people in total.</p>
<p>Some information in this report came from Reuters.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
More than any other form of zero-carbon energy, nuclear energy seems to
be stuck between its past and its future. There are currently
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=207&t=3#:~:text=As%20of%20April%2030%2C%202024,power%20reactors%20in%2028%20states." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>94
working reactors in the United States</u></a>, fewer than there were in
1990. With the country’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/biden-ai-electricity-demand" target="_blank">growing
energy needs</a> in mind, the federal government has made generous
incentives and tax credits available for constructing new nuclear power,
operating existing plants, and for re-opening shuttered plants. It has
also literally
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/advance-act-nuclear" target="_self"><u>rewritten
the rulebook</u></a> for nuclear power to encourage the development of
smaller advanced reactors that are supposed to be, eventually, cheaper
to build at scale.
</p>
<p>
But in the meantime, there’s the confused present.
</p>
<p>
Despite more reactors closing than opening in the past decade, nuclear
remains the largest source of carbon-free energy on the U.S. grid. Right
now, there are only a handful of reactor designs certified by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but no actual plans to build any more of
them. The two most recently built reactors in the U.S., Vogtle 3 and 4,
are both AP1000s, the latest version of the workhouse United States
nuclear design — massive light water reactors, the most common reactor
type, which use regular water as a coolant. (The other approved designs
include the ESBWR, a GE-Hitachi reactor, and the APR-1400 — both
versions of large, light-water reactors, both more likely to be built
overseas than at home.) The NRC has approved just one small modular
reactor design, but a recent attempt to actually build it for a
coalition of utilities
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/nuscale-small-modular-reactor-nuclear-costs-inflation" target="_self"><u>fell
through</u></a>.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The two reactors that have been built recently, Georgia’s Vogtle 3 and
4, were each delivered years behind schedule and billions of dollars
over budget. “So there was a feeling in the industry that we weren’t
going to build anymore AP1000s,” Jessica Lovering, co-founder and
executive director of the Good Energy Collective, told me. “And that was
a shame because we just got all this experience from doing this big
project.”
</p>
<p>
Lately, however, utilities have been asking a provocative question. What
if, instead of waiting for one of the many nascent advanced reactor
technologies to take off, we just … keep building AP1000s, instead?
</p>
<p>
Anyone who wants to build or buy new nuclear power might have a new
partner in The Nuclear Company, which wants to build a 6 gigawatt fleet
of reactors — to start — using “proven, licensed technology,” according
to the company’s public statements. Juliann Edwards, The Nuclear
Company’s chief development officer, wouldn’t specify which technology
in particular the company is planning on deploying, but she did tell me
it plans on doing so one after the other, in sequence, hoping to drive
down the massive price of building a new reactor. “We’re definitely
focused on fleet scale deployment,” Edwards said.<br/>
</p>
<p>
“Six has been this magic number that comes back again and again and
again,” Ted Nordhaus, founder and executive director of the Breakthrough
Institute told me. The Energy Policy Act of 2005, for instance, called
for 6,000 megawatts — a.k.a. 6 gigawatts — of new nuclear built with a
new production tax credit as an incentive, exactly what Edwards and crew
are planning to deliver.
</p>
<p>
The Nuclear Company won’t be designing or operating the reactors.
Instead, Edwards told me, “picture us as the front end as well as
throughput to operations. That’s ensuring that a project gets developed,
licensed, all the necessary environmental permits, interconnect
filings,” working with utilities that have licensed and permitted
development sites already lined up. The company is focusing particularly
on the big new sources of electricity demand — data centers and
manufacturing — which likely means it will concentrate its activities in
the East and Southeast. As far as areas where nuclear development has
already been approved, <em><em>Utility Dive
</em></em><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-nuclear-company-exits-stealth-to-deploy-standardized-6-gw-nuclear-fleet/721983/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>identified
sites in Florida and South Carolina</u></a> that are licensed for
AP1000, while others in Michigan and Virginia are authorized to use
GE-Hitachi reactors.
</p>
<p>
The reason having this fleet approach matters, Lovering told me, is that
building out a supply chain and getting the requisite investment is much
easier when everyone involved knows there’s going to be six reactors’
worth in the pipeline, and costs could fall as the reactors are
constructed. “If it was just a one-off project, I’d be much more
skeptical,” she said. “It’s always easier to get financing for a proven
project that’s already up and running.”
</p>
<p>
John Kotek, the head of public policy for the Nuclear Energy Institute,
concurred. He told me in an emailed statement that The Nuclear Company’s
business model “demonstrates the innovation needed to meet the demand
for clean, reliable nuclear energy.”
</p>
<p>
But there’s a reason much of the nuclear advocacy and policy community
has seen advanced reactors as
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/advanced-nuclear-data-centers" target="_self"><u>the
solution</u></a> to building out the scale of nuclear power needed to
help power a growing grid without carbon emissions. Nordhaus’
Breakthrough Institute is one of the biggest boosters of nuclear, with a
focus on reforming the regulatory system in order to make advanced
nuclear more economical.
</p>
<p>
“The market for a 1 gigawatt reactor is a very large public works
project,” Nordhaus said. “No one in the world has ever built one of
these things on spec. Instead, they’re typically built by national
energy companies, or, in the United States, by utilities who are able to
essentially charge their customers for the massive costs of
construction.”
</p>
<p>
While the nuclear industry has, with lots of intellectual and public
support from groups like Nordhaus’s Breakthrough, oriented its energies
toward advanced reactors, The Nuclear Company likely has fans in the
Department of Energy, which would really like to see more large reactors
getting built soon. “There’s a lot of energy right now, being driven in
part by [Secretary of Energy Jennifer] Granholm and [the Loan Programs
Office’s] Jigar [Shah], who are like, <em><em>We need to get nuclear
steel in the ground and get more AP1000s built</em></em>,” Nordhaus
said.
</p>
<p>
Granholm has called for a buildout of new nuclear “at a scale not seen
since the ’70s and ’80s.” The Department of Energy’s Loan Program
Office, meanwhile,
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/history" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
been supporting nuclear since its founding following the Energy Policy
Act of 2005</u>,</a> and Shah has
<a href="https://www.volts.wtf/p/nuclear-perhaps" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>scolded
utilities</u></a> and state regulators for demanding the government
essentially provide cost overrun insurance before they even think about
building a new AP1000, pointing to the incentives and loans available
from the feds.
</p>
<p>
Nordhaus, who called himself “skeptical” about The Nuclear Company’s
plans, told me that his goal was “to get technology to market that would
be feasible to build outside a vertically integrated market. I don’t see
how nuclear has a future in this country if you don’t do that.”
</p>
<p>
That’s Edwards’s goal, too. She’s confident that The Nuclear Company
could build even in restructured electricity markets where
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/where-nuclear-reactors-built-small-cost#:~:text=With%20gargantuan%20capital,into%20ratepayers%27%20bills." target="_self"><u>utilities
can’t tap their ratepayers</u></a> to build expensive new plants, she
told me. “We need to be able to get in a cycle where maybe we’re
breaking ground and by the late 2020s. And then we’re going into putting
neutrons on the grid by the mid 2030s.”

Carolina Supreme Court rules state death penalty including firing squad
is legal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>columbia, south carolina — South Carolina can execute death row
inmates by firing squad, lethal injection or the electric chair, the
state’s high court ruled Wednesday, opening the door to restart
executions after more than a decade.</p>
<p>All five justices agreed with at least part of the ruling. But two of
the justices said they felt the firing squad was not a legal way to kill
an inmate and one of them felt the electric chair is a cruel and unusual
punishment.</p>
<p>The state allowing inmates to choose from the three execution methods
is far from an effort to inflict pain but a sincere attempt at making
the death penalty less inhumane, Justice John Few wrote in the majority
opinion.</p>
<p>As many as eight inmates may be out of traditional appeals. It is
unclear when executions could restart or whether lawyers for death row
inmates can appeal the ruling.</p>
<p>Governor Henry McMaster said the justices interpreted the law
correctly.</p>
<p>“This decision is another step in ensuring that lawful sentences can
be duly enforced and the families and loved ones of the victims receive
the closure and justice they have long awaited,” he said in a
statement.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the death row inmates said they were reviewing the
94-page ruling before commenting.</p>
<p>South Carolina has executed 43 inmates since the death penalty was
restarted in the U.S. in 1976. Nearly all inmates have chosen lethal
injection since it became an option in 1995.</p>
<p>“Choice cannot be considered cruel because the condemned inmate may
elect to have the State employ the method he and his lawyers believe
will cause him the least pain,” Few wrote.</p>
<p>South Carolina hasn’t performed an execution since 2011. The state’s
supplies of drugs for lethal injections expired and no pharmaceutical
companies would sell more if they could be publicly identified.</p>
<p>Lawmakers authorized the state to create a firing squad in 2021 to
give inmates a choice between it and the old electric chair. The inmates
sued, saying either choice was cruel and unusual punishment prohibited
by the Constitution.</p>
<p>In spring 2023, the Legislature passed a shield law to keep lethal
injection drug suppliers secret and the state announced in September it
had the sedative pentobarbital and changed the method of lethal
injection execution from using three drugs to just one.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court allowed the inmates to add arguments that the
shield law was too secret by not releasing the potency, purity and
stabilization of lethal injection drugs.</p>
<p>South Carolina has 32 inmates on its death row. Four prisoners are
suing, but four more have also run out of appeals, although two of them
face a competency hearing before they could be executed, according to
Justice 360, an advocacy group for inmates.</p>
<p>The state said in its argument before the state Supreme Court in
February that lethal injection, electrocution and firing squad all fit
existing death penalty protocols.</p>
<p>“Courts have never held the death has to be instantaneous or
painless,” wrote Grayson Lambert, a lawyer for the governor’s
office.</p>
<p>But lawyers for the inmates asked the justices to agree with Circuit
Judge Jocelyn Newman, who stopped executions with the electric chair or
firing squad.</p>
<p>She cited the inmates’ experts, who testified at a trial that
prisoners would feel terrible pain whether their bodies were “cooking”
by 2,000 volts of electricity in the chair, built in 1912, or if their
hearts were stopped by bullets — assuming the three shooters were on
target — from the yet-to-be used firing squad.</p>
<p>On the shield law, the attorneys for the inmates said they need to
know if there is a regular supplier for the drug, which typically only
has a shelf life of 45 days, and what guidelines are in place to test it
and make sure it is what the seller claims.</p>
<p>Too weak a dose, and inmates may suffer without dying. Too strong,
and the drug molecules can form tiny clumps that would cause intense
pain when injected, according to court papers.</p>
<p>“No inmate in the country has ever been put to death with such little
transparency about how he or she would be executed,” Justice 360 lawyer
Lindsey Vann wrote.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the inmates did tell the justices in February that lethal
injection appears to be legal when it follows proper protocols, with
information about the drug given to the condemned in a manner that
matches what other states and the federal government use.</p>
<p>South Carolina used to carry out an average of three executions a
year and had more than 60 inmates on death row when the last execution
was carried out in 2011. Since then, successful appeals and natural
deaths have lowered the number to 32.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have sent only three new prisoners to death row in the
past 13 years. Facing rising costs, the lack of lethal injection drugs
and more vigorous defenses, they are choosing to accept guilty pleas and
life in prison without parole.</p>

<p>Tokyo — The United States this week moved to significantly strengthen
its alliances in the Indo-Pacific amid a perceived security threat from
China, including a major upgrade of the U.S. military command in
Japan.</p>
<p>Washington and Tokyo insist the changes are purely defensive, but
questions remain about the military readiness of the United States and
its allies if conflict erupts.</p>

Base outside the Okinawan capital, Naha, is America’s largest in the
Pacific region.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary
Lloyd Austin held so-called “2+2” talks with their Japanese counterparts
in Tokyo on Sunday and announced a major shift in defense relations.</p>
<p>“The United States will upgrade the U.S. Forces Japan to a joint
force headquarters with expanded missions and operational
responsibilities. This will be the most significant change to U.S.
Forces Japan since its creation and one of the strongest improvements in
our military ties with Japan in 70 years,” Austin told reporters.</p>
<p>“Our decision to move in this direction is not based upon any threat
from China. It’s based on our desire and our ability to work closer
together and to be more effective,” he said.</p>
<p>The upgraded military command is expected to be led by a three-star
general, with the possibility of a four-star general in future
leadership.</p>
<p>Analysts said it marked a profound change in the U.S. approach to its
forces in Japan.</p>
<p>“That means the Americans are serious. The Americans are really
serious about fighting a war [alongside] Japan. Against whom? I don’t
know. Whoever wants to change the status quo by force, we may have to
fight,” Kunihiko Miyake, president of the Tokyo-based Foreign Policy
Institute, told VOA.</p>
<p>The move is designed to complement Japan’s new Joint Operations
Command, which is due to launch in March 2025.</p>
<p>Grant Newsham, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Center for
Security Policy, welcomed the change.</p>
<p>“It’s a good first step … toward getting the Americans and the
Japanese in a position where they can actually fight together,” he told
VOA. “But what remains to be seen — and this is important — is how much
authority will it have? What units will be assigned to it? What
responsibility will it have in the event of a contingency?”</p>
<p>The U.S. and Japan also agreed to numerous other defense measures,
including joint missile development and the possible deployment of
American troops alongside Japanese forces in outlying islands.</p>
<p>Discussions also focused on so-called U.S. “extended deterrence” —
whether Washington would be willing to use its nuclear weapons to defend
Japan.</p>
<p>Japanese capabilities</p>
<p>Tokyo last year announced plans to double its defense spending to 2%
of its gross domestic product by 2027.</p>
<p>Newsham said the Japanese military needs huge investment in
recruitment, weapons and logistics.</p>
<p>“So, there’s a number of practical things that Japan needs to do to
be ready to fight a war. And then you ask yourself, ‘Well, how are you
going to actually link up with the Americans to fight? Have you done the
necessary planning and training so that you can just fall right in and
deal with a real-world contingency?’” he said.</p>
<p>There are fears that such a contingency is dangerously close. The
U.S. and Japan on Sunday labeled China the “greatest strategic
challenge” facing the region, amid Beijing’s rapid military buildup in
the disputed South China Sea and ongoing military exercises around
Taiwan.</p>
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has pledged to reunify the island with
China, and there is speculation he is planning to do so by force.</p>
<p>‘Lattice’ of alliances</p>
<p>In such a volatile region, U.S. officials say Washington is seeking
to interconnect its regional alliances with the United States and each
other, creating a “lattice” framework to protect Indo-Pacific
security.</p>
<p>There are limits to such cooperation, Miyake said.</p>
<p>“Of course, we cannot have a NATO-type collective alliance system,
because we have a different historical background. But what we needed to
have is multilayered security arrangements.”</p>
<p>The Philippines is emerging as a key U.S partner in the region.
Visiting Manila Tuesday alongside Austin, Blinken announced a $500
million military aid package for Manila, describing it as a
“once-in-a-generation investment to help modernize the Filipino armed
forces and coast guard.”</p>
<p>The “Quad” grouping of the United States, Japan, India and Australia
provides another layer of regional security. Foreign ministers of those
nations met in Tokyo on Monday, a day after the U.S.-Japan bilateral
meetings, and issued a joint statement calling for a “free and open”
Pacific.</p>
<p>The AUKUS alliance between the U.S., Australia and the United Kingdom
offers further scope for security coordination in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>But effective military alliances require more than agreements on
paper, Newsham said.</p>
<p>“For this so-called latticework of a range of alliances and
agreements that the Americans have tried to put together — well, with
whom can they do a real-world short notice operation? That means if you
had to go out and really do something for real, like fight, who could
they do it with? And that is a very, very short list. It’s pretty much
got nobody on it, except for the United States Navy and the Japanese
navy,” he said.</p>
<p>China checkmated?</p>
<p>Speaking to ABC News on July 6, U.S. President Joe Biden said the
network of alliances Washington had built in the Indo-Pacific region
were “checkmating” China. Newsham questioned that assertion.</p>
<p>“Look at Chinese operations around Taiwan. These are nonstop, almost
every day, and they’re getting closer and closer to Taiwan. They’re
surrounding Taiwan. And you might ask the Taiwanese if they think the
Chinese are checkmated,” Newsham said.</p>
<p>“Additionally, the Chinese and the Russians are doing more together
militarily than they ever have, circumnavigating Japan, getting close to
Alaska with nuclear-capable bombers. Well, the Chinese aren’t showing
any sign of having been checkmated. Their military buildup continues
unabated,” he said.</p>
<p>But the value of U.S. regional alliances — especially that with Japan
— shouldn’t be underestimated, said Miyake.</p>
<p>“Allies are the people or the countries who fight for you and bleed
for you. Who wants to fight against the Americans for the Chinese? I
don’t know. Even the Russians don’t want to do that,” Miyake said.</p>
<p>Beijing denies that it poses a threat to Indo-Pacific security. A
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson urged the U.S. and Japan to
abandon what it called a “Cold War mentality,” adding that the $500
million of U.S. military aid for the Philippines would increase
insecurity.</p>
<p>Russia on Wednesday said the U.S. and Japan appeared to be preparing
“for a large-scale armed conflict in the Asia-Pacific region.” Russian
Foreign Ministry deputy spokesperson Andrei Nastasin told reporters that
Moscow was consulting with China and North Korea on how best to
respond.</p>

what looks like one restaurant is actually dozens</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Restaurants are having a tough year, with high prices keeping customers
away. Cue some innovation. Today, we’ll visit Wonder on New York City’s
Upper West Side, which looks like a typical fast-food place from the
outside but is actually a startup serving dishes from multiple
restaurant brands. We’ll also learn more about Boeing’s space travel
business, corporate investments in AI and Microsoft’s calls for laws on
deepfake fraud.

id="biden-prods-congress-to-act-to-curb-fentanyl-from-mexico-as-trump-paints-harris-as-weak-on-border">Biden
prods Congress to act to curb fentanyl from Mexico as Trump paints
Harris as weak on border</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is prodding Congress to help him do
more to combat the scourge of fentanyl before he leaves office. </p>
<p>The Democratic administration is making the new policy push as
Republican former President Donald Trump steps up attacks against Vice
President Kamala Harris, painting her as Biden’s feckless lieutenant in
the battle to slow the illegal drugs and immigrants without
authorization coming into the United States from Mexico. </p>
<p>The White House on Wednesday announced a series of proposals from
Biden aimed at curbing the ongoing drug epidemic. These include a push
on Congress to pass legislation to establish a pill press and tableting
machine registry and enhance penalties against convicted drug smugglers
and traffickers of fentanyl. </p>
<p>Biden also wants to tighten rules on importers shipping small
packages into the United States, requiring shippers to provide
additional information to Customs and Border Protection officials. The
move is aimed at improving the detection of fentanyl precursor chemicals
that frequently find their way into the United States in relatively
low-value shipments that aren’t subject to customs and trade
barriers. </p>
<p>The president’s new efforts at combating fentanyl may also benefit
Harris, the likely Democratic nominee, as Trump and his surrogates are
trying to cast her as a central player in the Biden administration’s
struggles at the U.S.-Mexico border throughout his term. </p>
<p>“Still, far too many of our fellow Americans continue to lose loved
ones to fentanyl,” Biden said in a statement. “This is a time to act.
And this is a time to stand together — for all those we have lost, and
for all the lives we can still save.” </p>
<p>Biden said he will also sign a national security memorandum on
Wednesday aimed at improving the sharing of information between law
enforcement and federal agencies to improve understanding about the
flows of production and smuggling of the synthetic opioid that has
ravaged huge swaths of America. In the last five months, more than 442
million doses of fentanyl were seized at U.S. borders, according to the
White House. </p>
<p>The Trump campaign launched its first television ad of the general
election cycle on Tuesday, dubbing Harris the “border czar” and blaming
her for a surge in illegal crossings into the United States during the
Biden administration. After displaying headlines about crime and drugs,
the video brands Harris as “Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal.” </p>
<p>Border crossings hit record highs during the Biden administration but
have dropped more recently. </p>
<p>The Trump campaign has so far reserved $12.2 million in television
and digital ads through the next two weeks, according to data from the
media tracking firm AdImpact. </p>
<p>Biden tasked Harris early in his administration with addressing the
root causes of migration. Border crossings became a major political
liability for Biden when they reached historic levels. Since June, when
Biden announced significant restrictions on asylum applications at the
border, arrests for illegal crossings have fallen. </p>
<p>House Republicans passed a symbolic resolution last week criticizing
Harris’ work on the border on behalf of the Biden administration. </p>
<p>The White House reiterated its call on Congress to pass sweeping
immigration legislation that includes funding for more border agents and
drug detection machines at the border. GOP senators earlier this year
scuttled months of negotiations with Democrats on legislation intended
to cut back record numbers of illegal border crossings after Trump
eviscerated the bipartisan proposal. </p>
<p>The proposed pill-pressing registry floated by Biden aims to help law
enforcement crackdown on drug traffickers who use pill presses to press
fentanyl into pills. </p>
<p>Authorities say most illicit fentanyl is produced clandestinely in
Mexico, using chemical precursors from China. Synthetic opioids are the
biggest killers in the deadliest drug crisis the U.S. has ever seen. In
2014, nearly 50,000 deaths in the U.S. were linked to drug overdoses of
all kinds. By 2022, the total was more than 100,000, according to a
tally by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than
two-thirds of those deaths — more than 200 per day — involved fentanyl
or similar synthetic drugs. </p>
<p>Meeting with China</p>
<p>Meanwhile, administration officials and Chinese government officials
are expected to meet Wednesday to discuss efforts to curb the flow of
chemical precursors coming from China, according to a senior
administration official. </p>
<p>Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced at a November summit
in California that Beijing had agreed to press its chemical companies to
curtail shipments to Latin America and elsewhere of the materials used
to produce fentanyl. China also agreed to a resumption of sharing
information about suspected trafficking with an international
database. </p>
<p>But a special House committee focused on countering the Chinese
government in April issued a report that China still is fueling the
fentanyl crisis in the U.S. by directly subsidizing the manufacturing of
materials that are used by traffickers to make the drug outside the
country. </p>
<p>The official, who spoke under the condition of anonymity under ground
rules set by the White House, said China had taken “important steps,”
but there is much more to do.</p>

<h2 id="ai-causing-burnout-lower-productivity">AI causing burnout, lower
productivity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>Is machine learning, also known as “artificial intelligence”, really
aiding workers and increasing productivity? A study by Upwork – which,
as Baldur Bjarnason so helpfully points out, sells AI solutions and
hence did not promote this study on its blog as it does with its other
studies – reveals that this might not actually be the case. Nearly half
(47%) of workers using AI say they have no idea how to achieve the
productivity gains their employers expect. Over three in four (77%) say
AI tools have decreased their productivity and added to their workload
in at least one way. For example, survey respondents reported that
they’re spending more time reviewing or moderating AI-generated content
(39%), invest more time learning to use these tools (23%), and are now
being asked to do more work (21%). Forty percent of employees feel their
company is asking too much of them when it comes to AI. ↫ Upwork
research This shouldn’t come as a surprise. We’re in a massive hype
cycle when it comes to machine learning, and we’re being told it’s going
to revolutionise work and lead to massive productivity gains. In
practice, however, it seems these tools just can’t measure up to the
hyped promises, and in fact is making people do less and work slower.
There’s countless stories of managers being told by upper management to
shove machine learning into everything, from products to employee
workflows, whether it makes any sense to do so or not. I know from
experience as a translator that machine learning can greatly improve my
productivity, but the fact that there are certain types of tasks that
benefit from ML, doesn’t mean every job suddenly thrives with it. I’m
definitely starting to see some cracks in the hype cycle, and this study
highlights a major one. I hope we can all come down to earth again, and
really take a careful look at where ML makes sense and where it does
not, instead of giving every worker a ChatGPT account and blanket
demanding massive productivity gains that in no way match the reality on
the office floor. And of course, despite demanding massive productivity
increases, it’s not like workers are getting an equivalent increase in
salary. We’ve seen massive productivity increases for decades now, while
paychecks have not followed suit at all, and many people can actually
buy less with their salary today than their parents could decades ago.
Demands imposed by managers by introducing AI is only going to make this
discrepancy even worse.</p>

Earlier this month, the Department of Labor proposed a new rule that
would require employers to take steps — such as mandatory rest breaks
and illness prevention plans — to protect workers from extreme heat. A

popular, with 90% of respondents either “strongly” or “somewhat”
supporting the requirements.

Methane has long been recognized as a dangerous greenhouse gas,
shorter-lived in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, but more than 80
times more potent in its first 20 years there.

new paper</a> in <em>Frontiers in Science</em> finds that methane
emissions are growing at an alarming rate. Annual emissions in the 2020s
are clocking in at about 30 million tons more than during the previous
decade. While the study acknowledges there is no single reason for this,
the authors point to fossil fuel processing, livestock, and wetlands as
contributing factors. This spells trouble for the climate, particularly
over the next couple decades. “Reducing CO2 will protect our
grandchildren — reducing methane will protect us now,” one of the

on Tuesday. The reactor uses a modular design, allowing Kairos to
manufacture it in Albuquerque before shipping it to the construction
location, and employs fluoride salt cooling technology, a departure from
the light water cooling that is the norm in the U.S. nuclear industry.
In fact, the reactor was the first non-light water reactor to receive
construction approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in more
than 50 years when the agency issued it a permit last year. Kairos aims
to have the reactor operational in 2027.

<li>New climate change accounting standards
</h3>
<p>
The International Accounting Standards Board sets the norms for
companies in 140 jurisdictions — including the U.S., Canada, the E.U.,
and Japan — on how to record and report financial data. On Wednesday,
the Board proposed
<a href="https://www.ifrs.org/news-and-events/news/2024/07/iasb-improve-reporting-climate-related-other-uncertainties-fs/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_SXuy4VxQzfXTXsXO_biOhha6CRq0mWzbehlZzbINPuI3doR2yskVyNNCxFgDUyf_upHTa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">guidance</a>
for companies to show how climate change might affect their bottom
lines. Both climate impacts (like floods and extreme heat) and targets
(like net-zero strategies) have a bearing on a firm’s financial
performance, the IASB said. Wednesday’s guidance, which now enters a
consultation period, aims to provide a standardized approach to
reporting these factors to investors.
</p>
<p>
The guidance follows a March announcement by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission that it will require companies to disclose climate
change-related information to investors. As Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo

businesses of corporate emissions accounting and climate risk analysis,”
making robust standards that much more important.

<li>Meet Maximo, the solar-panel-installing robot
</h3>
<p>
On Tuesday, electric utility AES introduced a new hire: Maximo, a pickup
truck-sized robot charged with installing panels at the company’s solar
farms. AES says Maximo can install these heavy panels at twice the rate
a human could, using artificial intelligence to line them up. The
company plans to employ Maximo first on its solar-plus-battery project
in Kern County, California, later this year.
</p>
<p>
If Maximo proves effective, he may get some siblings. Large solar farms
can take 12 to 18 months to build and often require workers to operate
in extreme heat. Robots could reduce risks to workers and help companies
accelerate their construction timelines. The flipside? The number of
solar workers in the U.S. is expected to double by 2033, and these
workers may find some stiff competition from Maximo.

id="logitech-has-an-idea-for-a-forever-mouse-that-requires-a-subscription">Logitech
has an idea for a “forever mouse” that requires a subscription</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>Logitech CEO Hanneke Faber talked about someting called the “forever
mouse”, which would be, as the name implies, a mouse that customers
could use for a very long time. While you may think this would mean an
incredibly well-built mouse, or one that can be easily repaired, which
Logitech already makes somewhat possible through a partnership with
iFixIt, another option the company is thinking about is a subscription
model. Yes. Faber said subscription software updates would mean that
people wouldn’t need to worry about their mouse. The business model is
similar to what Logitech already does with video conferencing services
(Logitech’s B2B business includes Logitech Select, a subscription
service offering things like apps, 24/7 support, and advanced RMA).
Having to pay a regular fee for full use of a peripheral could deter
customers, though. HP is trying a similar idea with rentable printers
that require a monthly fee. The printers differ from the idea of the
forever mouse in that the HP hardware belongs to HP, not the user.
However, concerns around tracking and the addition of ongoing expenses
are similar. ↫ Scharon Harding at Ars Technica Now, buying a mouse whose
terrible software requires subscription models would still be a choice
you can avoid, but my main immediately conjured up a far darker
scenario. PC makers have a long history of adding crapware to their
machines in return for payments from the producers of said crapware. I
can totally see what’s going to happen next. You buy a brand new laptop,
unbox it at home, and turn it on. Before you know it, a dialog pops up
right after he crappy Windows out-of-box experience asking you to
subscribe to your laptop’s touchpad software in order to unlock its more
advanced features like gestures. But why stop there? The keyboard of
that new laptop has RGB backlighting, but if you want to change its
settings, you’re going to have to pay for another subscription. Your
laptop’s display has additional features and modes for specific types of
content and more settings sliders, but you’ll have to pay up to unlock
them. And so on. I’m not saying this will happen, but I’m also not
saying it won’t. I’m sorry for birthing this idea into the world.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
It has been a strange year for the climate left’s relationship with the
word “if.” Over the past several months, some activists and advocates
had begun to use the word with me in such a way that it started to sound
an awful lot like “when.” <em><em>If Donald Trump is reelected… If
Republicans return to power… </em></em>
</p>
<p>
The tone wasn’t hypothetical; it was
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/inflation-reduction-act-grants-funding#:~:text=It%20is%20in%20a%20race%20to%20spend%20as%20much%20of%20the%20money%20as%20it%20can%20in%20the%20next%20year%20%E2%80%94%20before%20a%20potential%20change%20of%20administration%20in%202025%20and%20before%20climate%20change%20gets%20any%20worse." target="_self"><u>resigned</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
In the past week and a half, however, “if” has gotten its mojo back.
Early this morning, the climate policy group Evergreen Action released
what it’s calling the
“<a href="https://evergreenaction.com/initiatives/a-bold-climate-plan-evergreen-action-plan-2" target="_blank">Evergreen
Action Plan 2.0</a>” — essentially, a green wishlist for an incoming
Democratic administration. Had the document been published a month
earlier, after President Biden’s disastrous debate performance, it might
have come across as vaguely farfetched; now,
<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-close-races-battleground-states-show-voters-locked" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>judging
by the polls</u></a>, there’s a real chance that some of its proposals
could actually become law in 2025.
</p>
<p>
Started by former staffers of Washington Governor Jay Inslee’s
presidential campaign, Evergreen Action has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/kamala-harris-climate-record" target="_self"><u>advised
Kamala Harris on her climate policies before</u></a>. The group also
<a href="https://www.evergreenaction.com/blog/we-wrote-the-climate-playbook-in-2020-biden-has-made-significant-progress-and-theres-more-opportunity-ahead-14" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>boasts</u></a>
that the Biden-Harris administration has made progress on 85% of the
policy recommendations issued in its original 2020 Evergreen Action
Plan. Although Evergreen Action doesn’t hold the same sway over a future
Harris administration as the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>does
over Donald Trump</u></a> (to his
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/project-2025-head-steps-down-89cba52b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>apparently
increasing concern</u></a>), it <em><em>does</em></em> seem pretty safe
to say that Evergreen Action 2.0 has the potential to be an enormously
influential document in a Harris White House.
</p>
<p>
So — what’s in it?
</p>
<p>
Unsurprisingly, the Evergreen Action Plan 2.0 aims to extend the gains
made by Biden’s administration and the Inflation Reduction Act — the
words “continue” or “continuing” are used 43 times in the document,
“further” 38 times, and “expand” or “expanded” 28 times. The plan is
broken into seven core strategies that are broadly framed around
climate, jobs, and justice, including “Cementing a Clean and Effective
National Grid,” “Promoting Healthy Communities With a Modern
Transportation System,” “Achieving Healthy Neighborhoods With
Zero-Emission Homes and Commercial Buildings,” and “Supporting All
Communities to Build a Thriving Clean Energy Economy and Move Away From
Fossil Fuels.”
</p>
<p>
Within these sections, stand-out proposals include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Setting a first-of-its-kind federal clean energy standard
</strong>to fully decarbonize the grid by 2035.
</li>
<li>
Passing a “national grid law <strong>creating an inter-regional transfer
capacity and shared grid management entity</strong>” in order to “align
federal authority to manage and site necessary transmission, and …
ensure full uptake of valuable IRA incentives for clean energy.”
</li>
<li>
<strong>Finalizing carbon limits for existing gas plants</strong> “no
later than the end of 2025” and ideally by December 2024.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Issuing an industrial decarbonization Day 1 Executive
Order</strong> that commits the country to a “rapid decarbonization
strategy for each industrial category.” Such an order could help
“prioritize innovation projects … leading to the development of regional
hubs for industrial decarbonization,” spur the EPA to begin a
“standard-setting process to tackle industrial climate pollution,” and
encourage the agency to further use grants, Superfund, and planning and
permitting programs to “accelerate the deployment of clean industrial
technologies and repurposing and clean up legacy industrial sites.”
</li>
<li>
<strong>Joining an international
“</strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/13/carbon-tariff-climate-change-china/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>carbon
club</strong></u></a><strong>”</strong> via legislation that “adds
duties or fees to imports of similar goods produced using high-carbon
methods in other countries.”
</li>
<li>
<strong>Focusing on building out a zero-emissions freight
sector</strong> by issuing “clear standards to help decarbonize sources
like trains, freight facilities and ports, off-road vehicles, ships, and
planes.”
</li>
<li>
<strong>Adopting a
“</strong><a href="https://www.evergreenaction.com/blog/what-is-the-climate-test-how-can-we-use-it-to-stop-the-next-mega-fossil-fuel-project" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>climate
test</strong></u></a><strong>” to guide all federal energy extraction
decisions</strong><strong>; </strong><strong>cutting subsidies and
statutory loopholes for fossil fuel companies; ending exports of
liquefied natural gas; withdrawing East Coast waters from oil
drilling</strong><strong>, and more.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The most radical section of the Evergreen Action Plan 2.0, however,
comes at the end. Acknowledging both the volatility of our national
politics and the reality that it will take longer than four more years
to put the U.S. on the right course of decarbonization, the plan extends
the definition of “climate policy” to include proposals intended to
shore up public and democratic institutions. Some of those include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Abolishing the filibuster</strong> <strong>rule</strong> that
“prevents the Senate from acting on climate and other policies the
public overwhelmingly supports.”
</li>
<li>
<strong>Repealing the
“</strong><a href="https://www.gao.gov/legal/congressional-review-act" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>Congressional
Review Act</strong></u></a><strong>,”</strong> which has been used to
“block needed climate standards and other common-sense public health and
safety measures.”
</li>
<li>
<strong>Ensuring the Supreme Court is “governed by a binding ethics
code,” and potentially “adding justices to the Court, adding term
limits</strong>, and exploring appropriate statutory guidance to limit
or reverse the Court’s recent spate of radical attacks on environmental
laws.”
</li>
<li>
<strong>Working with Congress to restore
</strong><a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/supreme-court-chevron" target="_self"><u><strong>the
Chevron doctrine</strong></u></a>.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Pursuing other democratic reforms “including restoration of the
Voting Rights Act and federal legislative remedies for improper
gerrymandering, along with long-term efforts to reform or abolish the
Electoral College,</strong><strong> would further shake loose fossil
fuel control of Congress and enable equitable policymaking
nationwide.”</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Of course, the Evergreen Action Plan 2.0 is nothing more than a wishlist
— it is far from a binding document — and there are still a whole lot of
“ifs” standing between it and implementation.
</p>
<p>
But for the climate left, “if” is a start.

id="undue-burden-one-familys-fight-for-american-journalists-freedom">‘Undue
Burden’: One family’s fight for American journalist’s freedom</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Prague/Washington  — Portraits of Alsu Kurmasheva are scattered
throughout the Prague apartment she shares with her husband and two
daughters. But the journalist has not set foot here in more than a
year.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most striking of the paintings, all of which were done by
her husband, Pavel Butorin, is the one that remains unfinished, perched
on an easel in the living room. Butorin started it after Kurmasheva, 47,
was jailed in Russia in October 2023 on charges that are widely viewed
as baseless and politically motivated.</p>
<p>Painting, Butorin says, is just one way he has tried to cope with his
wife’s absence.</p>
<p>“Even to say, ‘We miss Alsu,’ doesn’t quite convey the emotion that
we go through,” Butorin told VOA at the family’s home. “I get up, and
the first thing in my head is Alsu. I’ve just been really unable to
escape this.”</p>
<p>With their lives intertwined — from raising their daughters Bibi and
Miriam, to working at the same news network — he is never far from
reminders that his wife is 1,700 miles away, in a prison in the city of
Kazan.</p>
<p>“In the evening, we sit at this table. We see an empty chair,”
Butorin said, his eyes fixed on the seat at the large, wooden table, as
if he were willing his wife to appear. “It signifies a broken family, a
family torn apart by an unjust, merciless, heartless regime.”</p>
<p>When Butorin spoke with VOA in Prague in July, his wife — who has
dual U.S.-Russian citizenship — was approaching nine months in custody.
Less than one week later, on July 19, she was convicted behind closed
doors of spreading what Moscow says is false information about its
military and sentenced to six and a half years in prison.</p>
<p>On the same day, about 450 miles east, in the city of Yekaterinburg,
Russia, a secret Russian court convicted American journalist Evan
Gershkovich to 16 years behind bars.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has called for the immediate release of both
journalists. Press freedom groups, meanwhile, have condemned the trials
as shams and said the cases underscore how Moscow’s war in Ukraine means
American journalists are at a heightened risk of being used as political
pawns by the Kremlin.</p>
<p>Kurmasheva and Gershkovich count themselves among the 22 journalists
jailed in Russia at the end of 2023, more than half of whom are foreign
nationals, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.</p>
<p>Russia’s Foreign Ministry and embassy in Washington did not reply to
VOA’s emails requesting comment for this story.</p>
<p>Despite the international condemnation, Butorin has largely
shouldered the responsibility of advocating for Kurmasheva’s release by
himself. For months, he has found himself balancing the roles of father,
journalist and advocate as he shuttles between Prague and
Washington.</p>
<p>Hostage experts say his experience is common for American families
who have a loved one held hostage or unjustly detained.</p>
<p>A decade ago, Diane Foley was one of them as she tried to navigate
complex bureaucracy and conflicting information when Islamic State
militants kidnapped and later killed her son, American journalist James
Foley, in 2014.</p>
<p>Her experience led her to establish the Foley Foundation, which
supports families and advocates for Americans unjustly jailed
abroad.</p>
<p>“A lot of families don’t have any idea how to contact media or get
their story heard, how to contact their congressman, how to get their
voices heard through the bureaucracy. So we seek to help them navigate
that,” she told VOA during one of her regular trips to Washington.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has made progress in these policy areas, she
says. But so much more still needs to be done.</p>
<p>A longtime journalist at the Tatar-Bashkir Service of VOA’s sister
outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, or RFE/RL, Kurmasheva had
planned only a brief visit to Russia to care for her ailing mother.</p>
<p>Her desk at work remains relatively untouched. Business cards are
still spread out on the table. And the calendar — still set to May 2023
— shows where she underlined in black ink the dates of the ill-fated
trip.</p>
<p>In the weeks following Kurmasheva’s jailing, her colleague Ramazan
Alpaut said he still turned around at his desk, half-expecting to see
Kurmasheva sitting behind him.</p>
<p>“We miss her here as a person and as a colleague,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>Kurmasheva’s arrest came as a shock for the team, and a warning that
travel to see family in Russia is no longer an option.</p>
<p>That fact, says Tatar-Bashkir Service chief Rim Gilfanov,
crystallizes an already difficult reality for exiled Russians grappling
with the fallout of the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>But more immediately, he says, he just wants a key member of his team
back.</p>
<p>“Alsu is our veteran journalist,” Gilfanov says. “The main quality
that comes to my mind when I think of Alsu is constant eagerness and
preparedness to help everyone.”</p>
<p>Authoritarian regimes have long targeted RFE/RL and its journalists.
Russia has designated the outlet a foreign agent and an undesirable
organization. And Kurmasheva is one of four of its journalists currently
in prison, including two in Belarus and one in Russian-occupied
Crimea.</p>
<p>“It’s a grim reality that starts to set in that we are targets,”
RFE/RL president and CEO Stephen Capus told VOA. “They’re trying to make
the pursuit of journalism a crime.”</p>
<p>“They are taking me to the investigative committee right now.”</p>
<p>Butorin was at work when he got this distressed voice message from
his wife. It was October 18, 2023, and agents dressed in black and
wearing balaclavas had arrived at the home of Kurmasheva’s mother to
arrest the journalist.</p>
<p>The next time he heard his wife’s voice was in April 2024, when she
spoke to reporters from a glass defendant’s box about the poor prison
conditions she was experiencing.</p>
<p>“We love to hear her voice. But it’s also painful to see her in a
glass cage,” Butorin said.</p>
<p>Butorin, director of Current Time TV, a Russian-language television
and digital network led by RFE/RL in partnership with VOA, was at work
when he listened to the message.</p>
<p>His office is now part shrine, filled with photos and posters and
newspaper articles about his wife. On the whiteboard, Free Alsu magnets
depict a cartoon of her face. Butorin drew the image for Kurmasheva’s
Gmail profile picture, he said. Now it’s on magnets and buttons — like
the one pinned to the lapel of his dark blue suit jacket this July
afternoon.</p>
<p>In a corner, next to a Lego diorama of the set of the TV show
“Seinfeld” — a series the family loves to watch — is a stack of copies
of No to War. The book, which Kurmasheva helped edit, features stories
of 40 Russians who opposed Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Pro-Russian media have reported that Kurmasheva’s arrest is linked to
that book. But to date, authorities have failed to publicly provide
evidence to substantiate its charges against her.</p>
<p>“It’s a harmless little book,” Butorin said. “It just reminds me how
incredibly arbitrary this detention is.”</p>
<p>Butorin has spent an unknown number of hours thinking about his
wife’s captors. Are they evil personified? Or, à la Hannah Arendt and
the banality of evil, are they just bureaucrats “thoughtlessly” doing
their jobs?</p>
<p>The answer likely lies somewhere in the middle, he recognizes, but
Butorin still finds himself wondering whether the judges and prosecutors
once listened to her deep voice on the radio, back when she hosted a
show for audiences in Tatarstan.</p>
<p>Kurmasheva’s long absence has been marked by bittersweet birthdays
and holidays, more media interviews than Butorin can count, and five
trips to Washington to press lawmakers and U.S. government officials to
do more for his wife.</p>
<p>In his office, just a few days before he departs for one of those
trips, he admits that, like many journalists, he prefers to be behind
the camera instead of being the story.</p>
<p>But that preference for privacy is no more.</p>
<p>“I fear if I don’t keep this story in the news, and if I don’t keep
Alsu’s story alive, that U.S. policymakers, members of the
administration, of any administration, will just start forgetting about
her,” Butorin said. “I see a problem there.”</p>
<p>Butorin, who is also a U.S. citizen, is quick to voice appreciation
for the support officials and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have
offered. It turns out that press freedom is one of the few issues that
Democrats and Republicans can agree on.</p>
<p>But the trips to the American capital are also stained with
frustration.</p>
<p>Requests to meet with Secretary of State Antony Blinken have been
denied, Butorin said. (Blinken also serves as an ex officio member of
the board that oversees the entities under the U.S. Agency for Global
Media, including RFE/RL and VOA.) To date, the highest-ranking official
Butorin has met with is Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs Rena
Bitter.</p>
<p>Feeling optimistic can be difficult, Butorin said, when, in meeting
after meeting, the same officials regurgitate the same talking points
and offer little concrete information.</p>
<p>“Sometimes I walk out with a sense of desperation, and sometimes I
find these meetings very unsatisfactory,” he says.</p>
<p>It’s a problem familiar to Diane Foley.</p>
<p>When Islamic State militants kidnapped her son in 2012, she says, the
process was even more opaque.</p>
<p>“Our government doesn’t seem to trust these desperate families, who
want their loved one back, with what information they have,” she
said.</p>
<p>To Foley, “an undue burden” is still placed on families to fight for
the U.S. government’s attention.</p>
<p>“It’s all on the family in the U.S. That hasn’t changed a whole lot,”
she said. “It was all on me, all on our family, when Jim was taken — all
on us to figure it out. And now it’s still all on the family.”</p>
<p>Foley and her foundation are helping Butorin navigate the process,
including by working behind the scenes to push the State Department.</p>
<p>In that time, she has grown close to the couple’s daughters. “When I
see Bibi and Miriam, God bless them. They shouldn’t, as teenagers, be
dealing with this,” she said.</p>
<p>In late July, she and Butorin took part in a Foley Foundation event
in the Capitol Building, to mark the release of its annual report on
U.S. hostage policy. The foundation counts 46 Americans held hostage or
unjustly detained around the world.</p>
<p>At the panel, Dustin Stewart, the deputy special presidential envoy
for hostage affairs, spoke about the support the government offers.</p>
<p>Butorin rebutted that because Kurmasheva has not been declared
wrongfully detained, his family is not receiving any of that
support.</p>
<p>At the panel, Stewart told VOA, “On the process, I’ll just say, it’s
ongoing.”</p>
<p>The designation opens up extra resources and support for families and
commits the government to secure their release.</p>
<p>It is the biggest difference between the cases of Kurmasheva and
Gershkovich, the other American journalist jailed in Russia. In the
latter case, the United States declared The Wall Street Journal reporter
wrongfully detained within two weeks of his arrest. Press freedom groups
have criticized the State Department for not declaring Kurmasheva
wrongfully detained, too.</p>
<p>When pressed as to if and when Kurmasheva will be designated, the
State Department has on several occasions sent VOA identical or nearly
identical statements that say the Department “continuously reviews the
circumstances” of Americans detained overseas to determine if they are
wrongful. Roger Carstens, the special presidential envoy for hostage
affairs, has denied VOA’s multiple requests for an interview about
Kurmasheva’s case.</p>
<p>To cope, Butorin says compartmentalizing has become a necessary
strategy.</p>
<p>“It may come across as a little disingenuous, but you do have to
treat all these little areas of your life as projects,” he said. Those
“projects” range from calling on Blinken to declare his wife wrongfully
detained to dealing with the “Kafkaesque bureaucracy” of the Czech
postal system that prevents him from collecting his wife’s mail.</p>
<p>In public events and interviews, Butorin leans toward the stoic,
which he notes is unlike Kurmasheva, who can go into a room and “walk
away with five or 10 new friends.”</p>
<p>“Some people may think that I lack emotion,” Butorin said. “But it’s
all a front. I’m hurting on the inside.”</p>
<p>It’s when Butorin is by himself that he says he feels the most pain.
“When the girls go to bed, I usually go to bed soon, too,” Butorin said,
“so I’m not left alone with my thoughts.”</p>
<p>And when he is with the couple’s daughters, there are glimpses of the
joy and the humor the family still manages to share.</p>
<p>After an interview in Washington, Butorin excitedly showed videos
from an Olivia Rodrigo concert he attended with his daughters. Nearby,
Bibi, 16, and Miriam, 12, were writing postcards to friends in Prague.
Butorin made fun of one of them for how she wrote the number seven.</p>
<p>“You cross your sevens? That’s un-American,” he said with a smirk,
provoking laughter from both girls.</p>
<p>When Kurmasheva eventually returns, Butorin quipped that she will
find their daughters taller than she is. “But more importantly, she will
see very strong young women who have had to grow up really quickly,” he
said.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when Butorin sees videos or photos of his wife in court,
he finds himself wondering whether she’s still the same person. In any
case, he and his daughters aren’t.</p>
<p>“It’s hurting my family a lot that my mom isn’t here with us,” Bibi
said. “It’s been so long already, and we just don’t want to get used to
our mom not being here, because we’re getting close to that,
unfortunately.”</p>
<p>Back in the family’s Prague apartment, the teenager alternates
between talking about Taylor Swift and calling on Russian President
Vladimir Putin to release her mother. On the wall opposite her, an
abstract painting by her father depicts Kurmasheva pregnant with
Bibi.</p>
<p>“At the dinner table, I always feel like there’s something missing
because she’s not there. And it’s weird having to cook for one less
person. And it’s weird being in the car with one less person. And it’s
weird, because we were always a family of four. And now there’s one of
us missing,” Bibi said.</p>
<p>Butorin doesn’t like to dwell on the past, and by that he primarily
means Kurmasheva’s decision to travel to Russia in the first place. They
were both well aware of the risks, he said.</p>
<p>She had traveled there without incident in 2022. But the day she left
in 2023, he recalls Kurmasheva saying to him, “Tell me everything will
be OK.”</p>
<p>Some days, Butorin wishes he hadn’t let her go. But then, Kurmasheva
wouldn’t be Kurmasheva if she hadn’t gone.</p>
<p>“She is known as a selfless friend,” Butorin said. “That empathy and
her responsibility as a devoted daughter, that was what really drove her
to go to Russia.”</p>
<p>Bibi agreed. “She pays attention to every single person around her,
and she’s really willing to give up so many things about her and her
life to help others.”</p>
<p>As the family waits for any progress in her case, Butorin channels
his wife’s unselfishness and his daughters’ resiliency.</p>
<p>“I don’t have the luxury of just falling apart. Honestly, that’s not
an option for me,” Butorin said. “It’s just something that we have to
live with. I think I’m a fairly unremarkable person. It’s just something
that a father — any father — I think would do.”</p>

<h2 id="us-carries-out-strike-in-iraq-as-regional-tensions-worsen">US
carries out strike in Iraq as regional tensions worsen</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BAGHDAD/WASHINGTON — The United States on Tuesday carried out a
strike in Iraq in self-defense, U.S. officials told Reuters, as regional
tensions rose after an Israeli airstrike in Beirut that Israel said
killed Hezbollah’s most senior commander.</p>
<p>Iraqi police and medical sources said the strike inside a base south
of Baghdad used by Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) killed four
members of the group, which includes several Iran-aligned armed
militias, and wounded four others.</p>
<p>In a statement after the blasts, the Popular Mobilization Forces made
no accusation about who was responsible.</p>
<p>U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United
States carried out an airstrike in Musayib, in Babil province, but did
not provide more details on the location.</p>
<p>The officials added that the strike targeted militants that the U.S.
deemed were looking to launch drones and posed a threat to U.S. and
coalition forces.</p>
<p>The officials did not comment on any casualties.</p>
<p>“This action underscores the United States’ commitment to the safety
and security of our personnel,” one of the officials said.</p>
<p>Multiple rockets were launched last week toward Iraq’s Ain al-Asad
airbase housing U.S.-led forces, U.S. and Iraqi sources said, with no
damage or casualties reported. U.S. officials said none of the rockets
hit the base.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s action was the first known U.S. strike in Iraq since
February, when the U.S. military launched airstrikes in Iraq and Syria
against more than 85 targets linked to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard and
Iran-aligned militias.</p>
<p>The 150,000-strong Popular Mobilization Forces, a state-sanctioned
grouping of Iraqi paramilitaries, is dominated by heavily armed and
battle-hardened groups loyal to Iran and with close ties to its
Revolutionary Guards.</p>
<p>Iraq, a rare ally of both the U.S. and Iran that hosts 2,500 U.S.
troops and has Iran-backed militias linked to its security forces, has
witnessed escalating tit-for-tat attacks since the Israel-Hamas war
erupted in October.</p>
<p>Iraq wants troops from the U.S.-led military coalition to begin
withdrawing in September and to formally end the coalition’s work by
September 2025, Iraqi sources have said, with some U.S. forces likely to
remain in a newly negotiated advisory capacity.</p>
<p>The issue is highly politicized, with mainly Iran-aligned Iraqi
political factions looking to show that they are again pushing out the
country’s one-time occupier, while U.S. officials want to avoid giving
Iran and its allies a win.</p>
<p>U.S.-led forces invaded Iraq in 2003, toppled former leader Saddam
Hussein and then withdrew in 2011, only to return in 2014 to fight
Islamic State at the head of a coalition.</p>

<h2 id="us-needs-to-do-more-to-compete-with-china-says-official">US
needs to do more to compete with China, says official</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. State Department Deputy Secretary of State Kurt
Campbell says that whether it is exploring for rare earth minerals,
establishing military bases in Africa, or building more ships and
submarines, the United States needs to do more to compete with
China.</p>
<p>Speaking at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing Tuesday,
Campbell called China the “defining geopolitical challenge confronting
modern American diplomacy.”</p>
<p>“We need to do more, and we have to contest Chinese actions, not only
in terms of their forward basing strategy, but their desire to go after
Africa’s rare earths that will be critical for our industrial and
technological capabilities,” he said.</p>
<p>Campbell added that China has presented U.S. diplomats with a global
challenge that extends from economics and defense to information and
human rights.</p>
<p>Bipartisan desire to compete</p>
<p>Lawmakers from across the political divide who attended the hearing
agreed with that assessment and the need to compete with China’s
influence.</p>
<p>Republican Senator Marco Rubio from Florida expressed concern about
China being the “world’s leading shipbuilder” and “undisputed king of
basic industrial inputs.”</p>
<p>Campbell agreed with the senator, noting that the difference between
the two countries was “deeply concerning,” and that the U.S. “has to do
better” in shipbuilding.</p>
<p>He also said the United States submarine program needs more
attention.</p>
<p>In his opening remarks, Ben Cardin, a Democratic senator and chair of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the United States needs to
offer the Global South an alternative to China.</p>
<p>“In order to address these challenges, the United States should not
only be investing in our military, but also our diplomatic and economic
development tools,” Cardin said.</p>
<p>Technology and critical rare earth minerals used to make everything
from semiconductor chips to batteries in electric vehicles was an area
of particular focus during the hearing, given China’s dominance.</p>
<p>In 2022, China was the largest source of rare earth mineral imports
for the United States at 70%, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
It is also the world’s biggest supplier of rare earth minerals.</p>
<p>“If you look at a balance sheet of the top 40 trace elements and
minerals that are necessary for batteries or for semiconductors, the
vast lion’s share of those supplies are now controlled by China,”
Campbell said. He noted that while the U.S. was initially in an
unfavorable position, it has stepped up signing critical mineral
agreements with Japan and Australia.</p>
<p>Campbell also said the Lobito corridor project in Africa — a railway
that will run through mineral-rich Zambia and the Democratic Republic of
Congo to an Atlantic port in Angola — would help meet U.S. demand for
the minerals.</p>
<p>Hearing looks at relations with Africa</p>
<p>Increasing diplomatic relations with Africa was a key focus of the
hearing.</p>
<p>Campbell said he has traveled to Africa twice since his appointment
in February and has plans for a third trip. He also noted that there are
14 ambassador nominations for posts on the continent yet to be approved
by the Senate.</p>
<p>Several senators at the hearing stressed the need to increase the
U.S. diplomatic footprint and fill empty ambassadorial posts,
particularly within the Global South.</p>
<p>Campbell said the lack of U.S. ambassadors in key posts is
“embarrassing” and “antithetical to U.S. strategic interests.”</p>
<p>During the hearing, lawmakers also discussed the need for U.S.
involvement in international infrastructure development projects,
continued support of Ukraine against Russia’s invasion, and the need for
more efforts to combat Chinese misinformation and press manipulation in
third countries.</p>

id="after-destroying-nearly-200-structures-us-wildfire-threatens-thousands-more">After
destroying nearly 200 structures, US wildfire threatens thousands
more</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>FOREST RANCH, California — Fire crews worked Tuesday to hold on to
the progress made against the largest blaze in California this year
ahead of warming temperatures forecast for later this week. </p>
<p>Authorities said containment was 14% and lifted evacuation orders in
some communities of Butte County, where the Park Fire started last week
before spreading to a neighboring county and scorching an area bigger
than Los Angeles. The massive fire continues to burn through rugged,
inaccessible terrain with dense vegetation, threatening to spread to two
other counties. </p>
<p>“That’s going to be a continued challenge for us moving forward over
the next couple of days,” said Mark Brunton, an operations section chief
with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. </p>
<p>Cooler weather has helped firefighters stop the blaze’s path near
some communities like Forest Ranch, where some people began returning to
unscathed homes Tuesday. </p>
<p>Christopher and Anita Angeloni have lived in the community of 1,600
for 23 years and have had to evacuate several times due to wildfires,
including the 2018 Camp Fire that killed 85 people and decimated the
town of Paradise, about 8 miles (13 kilometers) south. </p>
<p>Christopher Angeloni said he constantly worked on creating defensible
space around his home and was happy to return home nearly a week after
evacuating to see his hard work paid off. </p>
<p>“We were prepared to possibly lose everything,” he said. </p>
<p>Anita Angeloni said it has been a stressful week. </p>
<p>“We have not been sleeping enough, very tense, praying all the time,
teary eyes,” she said. “But we’re here. We’ll see for how long.” </p>
<p>The Park Fire, now the fifth largest in the state’s recorded history,
was one of more than 100 large active wildfires burning in the U.S. on
Tuesday. It has scorched nearly 600 square miles (1,551 square
kilometers), according to CAL Fire. For comparison, the city of Los
Angeles covers about 470 square miles (1,217 square kilometers). </p>
<p>Some blazes were sparked by the weather, with climate change
increasing the frequency of lightning strikes as the western U.S.
endures blistering heat and bone-dry conditions. </p>
<p>The Park Fire started last Wednesday after authorities say a man
pushed a burning car down a ravine in Chico. It has destroyed nearly 200
structures and is threatening thousands more. The suspect, Ronnie Dean
Stout II, was charged with arson on Monday. His public defender, Nicole
Diamond, said in an email she had no comment. </p>
<p>Some progress against the fire was made after cooler temperatures,
more humidity, and calmer winds in the last few days helped firefighters
reach 14% containment as of Tuesday. </p>
<p>In the small forest community of Cohasset in Butte County, Ron Ward
ignored evacuation orders last week and stayed behind with his son to
defend his property, seeing Park Fire flames hundreds of feet high
approach his family ranch. </p>
<p>He had lost insurance coverage on the property just a month earlier
as companies increasingly drop California homeowners due to the growing
risk of wildfires in the state. </p>
<p>He said the flames reached within 70 feet (21 meters) of his house.
Then they stopped. </p>
<p>“It hit our sprinklers and kind of died down and then went around our
property and missed, missed all of our structures,” Ward said. His
100-year-old ranch was saved. </p>
<p>Ward had to be the one to call his bookkeeper and neighbors to tell
them their homes were gone. </p>
<p>“They haven’t even been able to get back to look at their homes,” he
said, tearing up as he recounted last week’s experience to The
Associated Press in an interview Monday. </p>
<p>All through Cohasset, there were remnants of the devastation, with
charred mailboxes and vehicles covered with pink fire retardant dropped
by aircraft. The husks of a washer and dryer set were surrounded by
burned debris and a blackened motorcycle was propped upright, balancing
on rims after its tires melted away. </p>
<p>Evacuation orders were in effect Tuesday on 25 wildfires, according
to the National Interagency Fire Center. More than 27,000 wildland
firefighters and support personnel are assigned to wildfires that have
burned more than 3,200 square miles (8,288 square kilometers)
nationwide, the center said. </p>
<p>In Southern California, people in Kern and Tulare counties were
ordered to evacuate because of a fire sweeping through the Sequoia
National Forest. The Borel Fire scorched through almost the entirety of
the historic mining town of Havilah, officials said. </p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is scheduled to visit the town of
250 people later Tuesday. </p>
<p>“We’re seeing so many of these iconic places in California . . .
being quite literally devastated by these new realities,” Newsom
said. </p>
<p>The fires burning throughout the state have overwhelmed California’s
firefighting capacity and outside help has started to arrive, officials
said. Newsom thanked Texas Governor Gregg Abbott on Tuesday for sending

<p>U.S. Fire Administrator Dr. Lori Moore-Merrell said one-third of U.S.
residents live in an area where human activities and wildland vegetation
intersect, creating a higher potential for wildfires, according to a

<p>“We question living here for sure,” Ward said of his ranch in
Cohasset. But generations have remained since his wife’s
great-grandfather settled there in 1905, and he isn’t the one to leave,
he said. </p>
<p>“There’s a lot of history here,” Ward said. “So we live on this
ranch, and we’re committed to this ranch and preserving the ranch.”</p>

House pushes Biden’s Supreme Court proposal despite Republican
objections</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WHITE HOUSE — The White House plans to continue President Joe Biden’s
push for sweeping reforms of the U.S. Supreme Court during his final
months in office, despite the proposal having little chance of passing
the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.</p>
<p>“What we welcome is a debate,” White House press secretary Karine
Jean-Pierre said in response to VOA’s question during her briefing
Tuesday.</p>
<p>Jean-Pierre said there is broad public support for reform of the
court. She sidestepped questions on whether the proposal is mainly a
messaging strategy ahead of the November presidential election rather
than a legislative goal for Biden, who is not seeking reelection.</p>
<p>“As many times as the president introduced legislation, or some ideas
of how the direction of the legislation that’s important to the American
people, we see a healthy debate,” she said.</p>
<p>On Monday, Biden urged Congress to eliminate lifetime appointments
for Supreme Court justices and establish a system in which the sitting
president would appoint a justice every two years to spend 18 years in
service on the court.</p>
<p>His proposal would “reduce the chance that any single president
imposes undue influence for generations to come,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Under the American political system, presidents appoint justices who
are confirmed by the U.S. Senate and serve on the Supreme Court until
they die or resign. The highest court of the land provides the final
word on legal interpretations of the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>Speaker of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson dismissed the
plan as part of Democrats’ “ongoing efforts to delegitimize the Supreme
Court.”</p>
<p>“It is telling that Democrats want to change the system that has
guided our nation since its founding simply because they disagree with
some of the Court’s recent decisions,” he said in a statement. “This
dangerous gambit of the Biden-Harris Administration is dead on arrival
in the House.”</p>
<p>Biden’s proposal would “tilt the balance of power and erode not only
the rule of law, but the American people’s faith in our system of
justice,” he added.</p>
<p>Six of the nine Supreme Court justices were appointed by Republican
presidents, including three by former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Biden also wants legislation to establish an enforceable ethics code
for the court’s nine justices. Currently, the justices are free to
police themselves under ethics rules that were put in place last year
following revelations that Justice Clarence Thomas had received
expensive gifts from Republican donors and that the wife of Justice
Samuel Alito flew two flags often used by followers of Trump’s Make
America Great Again movement.</p>
<p>The ethics part of the proposal is “the most politically feasible,”
said Claire Finkelstein, professor of law and philosophy at the
University of Pennsylvania and the director of the Penn Center for
Ethics and the Rule of Law.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John Roberts’ failure to discipline his own members
“cast great opprobrium on the court,” and makes it “illegitimate to a
large degree,” she told VOA, adding that there may be bipartisan support
“to rescue the court from its own problematic conduct.”</p>
<p>The third part of Biden’s reform proposal requires lawmakers to
ratify a constitutional amendment limiting presidential immunity.</p>
<p>An amendment would reverse the court’s recent landmark ruling in
favor of Trump that presidents are allowed some immunity from criminal
prosecution for acts conducted while in office.</p>
<p>“This nation was founded on the principle there are no kings in
America,” Biden said. “Each of us are equal before the law. No one is
above the law. For all practical purposes, the court’s decision almost
certainly means the president can violate their oath, flout our laws,
and face no consequences.”</p>
<p>Messaging push</p>
<p>Passage of the proposal seem unlikely in light of Republican control
of House and the Democrats’ slim majority in the Senate.</p>
<p>Passage of a constitutional amendment requires two-thirds support in
both congressional chambers, or approval by two-thirds of the states at
a special convention. Either way, it would then need to be ratified by
three-fourths of the state legislatures.</p>
<p>Biden’s proposal is “both a messaging push and a warning to the
Roberts court to clean up its act,” said Democratic Party strategist
Julie Roginsky.</p>
<p>“It underscores the fact that the Supreme Court’s recent decisions
have posed a grave threat to democracy and that the next president will
have an opportunity to shape the court and, with it, the future of our
democracy,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>Only 41% of Americans have a favorable opinion of the Supreme Court,
according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted in June.</p>
<p>American confidence in the Supreme Court has declined in recent years
as more people see the institution as partisan. A majority of Americans
(53%) say that they think Supreme Court justices rule mainly on the
basis of their partisan political views, according to a 2023 poll by ABC
News/Ipsos, up 10 percentage points from 2022.</p>
<p>Various polls show that voters of both parties are in favor of term
limits for justices, including a Fox News poll in July that show most
Americans strongly favor mandatory retirement.</p>
<p>“Biden’s proposals bundle some of the most popular reforms while
avoiding some of the more politically divisive,” said Chris Jackson,
senior vice president at Ipsos, referring to a court-packing proposal
pushed by some progressives that would expand the size of the Supreme
Court to quickly eliminate the court’s lean to the right.</p>
<p>“It remains to be seen if this will be an effective campaign message
for the Harris campaign heading into the election,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic presidential
nominee, backed Biden’s proposal on Monday.</p>
<p>“President Biden and I strongly believe that the American people must
have confidence in the Supreme Court,” she said in a statement. “Yet
today, there is a clear crisis of confidence facing the Supreme Court as
its fairness has been called into question after numerous ethics
scandals and decision after decision overturning long-standing
precedent.”</p>
<p>Trump, meanwhile, dismissed it.</p>
<p>“It’s going nowhere,” he said in a Fox News interview Monday. “He
knows that, too.”</p>
<p>VOA’s Kim Lewis contributed to this report.</p>

<h2 id="less-coffee-better-sleep">Less Coffee, Better Sleep</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: Marginallia log</p>
<p>As an experiment, I’ve reduced my coffee-intake to a single cup a day
for about a week now. It’s made an enormous difference in sleep, mood
and energy. I get tired at night, fall asleep quickly, and wake up
refreshed. As mentioned previously in the context of morning sunlight
exposure—another thing that’s aided my sleeping habits, but is somewhat
less practical to sustain as it requires fair weather—I’ve always been
slow to get going in the morning, active at night, bad at getting to bed
at sane hours.</p>

<h2 id="pg_ivm-1.9-released">pg_ivm 1.9 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
IVM Development Group is pleased to announce the release of
<a href="https://github.com/sraoss/pg_ivm/releases/tag/v1.9">pg_ivm
1.9</a>.
</p>
<p>
Changes since the v1.8 release include:
</p>
<h3>
Bug fixes
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Add support for PostgreSQL 17 (Yugo Nagata, Takuma Hoshiai, reshke)
</p>
<p>
This contains the following changes:
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Change functions to use a safe search_path during maintenance operations
when used with PostgreSQL 17
</p>
<p>
This prevents maintenance operations (automatic maintenance of IMMVs and
refresh_immv) from performing unsafe access. Functions used by IMMVs
that need to reference non-default schemas must specify a search path
during function creation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
refresh_immv can be executed by users with the MAINTAIN privilege when
used with PostgreSQL 17
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
About pg_ivm
</h3>
<p>
pg_ivm is an extension module that provides Incremental View Maintenance
(IVM) feature.
</p>
<p>
Incremental View Maintenance (IVM) is a way to make materialized views
up-to-date in which only incremental changes are computed and applied on
views rather than recomputing. pg_ivm provides a kind of immediate
maintenance, in which materialized views are updated immediately after a
base table is modified.
