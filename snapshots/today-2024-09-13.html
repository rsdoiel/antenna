California mountain town walloped by blizzard is now threatened by
wildfire</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>RUNNING SPRINGS, California — In the Southern California mountain
town of Running Springs, residents live between two scenic lake resorts
— a seemingly serene spot but one also caught between the swings of
devastating winter snowstorms and menacing summer wildfires.  </p>
<p>Niko Rynard is currently evacuated from his home due to the Line
Fire, which has charred 58 square miles (150 square km) since the
weekend.  </p>
<p>About a year and a half ago, the director of the Running Springs Area
Chamber of Commerce raced down the mountains during a break in the
relentless snowfall his neighbors came to call “Snowmageddon.” Roads
were blocked for days.  </p>
<p>The 29-year-old, who moved to the area nine years ago from the East
Coast, is now staying with friends nearby but said others are shelling
out hundreds of dollars to cram into hotel rooms until it’s safe to
return.  </p>
<p>The blaze is one of three major wildfires that have ravaged the
mountains east of Los Angeles, destroying dozens of homes and forcing
the evacuations of thousands of people. While California is only now
confronting the height of wildfire season, the state already has seen
nearly three times as much acreage burn than during all of 2023.  </p>
<p>Much of this, Rynard said, “comes with the territory” and is part of
living in a beautiful area. He said long-time residents have told him
the massive wildfires are cyclical, much like the snow.  </p>
<p>To add to people’s rattled nerves, Southern California was rocked by
a 4.7-magnitude earthquake Thursday morning.  </p>
<p>Running Springs is dubbed the “gateway to the San Bernardino
Mountains” and perched more than a mile high. The town was among the
communities snowed in when a blizzard walloped the area in 2023. Now,
the community has been doused with bright fire-red retardant to protect
it.  </p>
<p>“It can be tough to live in these environments,” said Dawn Rowe, a
San Bernardino County supervisor whose district covers mountain
communities. “It’s beautiful — a lot of people come to visit and they
find they might want to relocate for one reason or another. I would
encourage everybody to spend an amount of time doing their due
diligence.”  </p>
<p>The Line Fire is burning through dense vegetation that grew after two
back-to-back wet winters that included snowstorms that caused tree
branches to break, leaving behind a lot of “dead and down fuel,” said
Cal Fire Operations Section Chief Jed Gaines. Another wildfire
threatened the mountain community of Wrightwood about a 50-mile
(80-kilometer) drive to the west.  </p>
<p>The fires have threatened tens of thousands of homes and other
structures across Southern California since they escalated during a
triple-digit heat wave over the weekend. Cooler weather was helping
firefighters slowly gain the upper hand in battling the blazes. No
deaths have been reported, but at least a dozen people, mainly
firefighters, have been treated for injuries, mostly heat-related,
authorities said.  </p>
<p>In one daring rescue caught on video, Cal Fire Riverside County
Battalion Chief Mike Martinez saved a lone woman walking within feet of
the Airport Fire in Orange County, driving his SUV up to the edge of the
blistering flames so she could enter the vehicle.  </p>
<p>“This is one of those moments … you hope you never come across,” he
told the Los Angeles Times. “I’ve been doing this for almost 30 years.
We’re used to extreme fire behavior but to see a civilian walking down
the middle of the street was surreal.”  </p>
<p>Jason Anderson, district attorney for San Bernardino County, said
Thursday that nine arson-related charges have been filed against a
suspect accused of starting the Line Fire. </p>
<p>“This is particularly galling in a community that unfortunately over
the last couple of years has dealt with the scourge of wildfires,” he
told reporters, adding that the suspect’s vehicle has been linked to
three areas where fires were started.  </p>
<p>The suspect is due to be arraigned in court on Friday.  </p>
<p>The full extent of the damage caused by the wildfires remains
unclear. The three blazes are: </p>
<p>— The Airport Fire in Orange County, which has burned more than 36
square miles (93 square kilometers). The fire was 5% contained Thursday
morning and was reportedly sparked by workers using heavy equipment in
the area. Ten firefighters and two residents were injured in the blaze,
according to the Orange County Fire Authority. The fire has been
difficult to tame because of the steep terrain and dry conditions — and
because some areas hadn’t burned in decades. </p>
<p>— The Line Fire in the San Bernardino National Forest, which was 18%
contained Thursday and has threatened more than 65,000 homes. The blaze
has injured three firefighters. </p>
<p>— The Bridge Fire east of Los Angeles, which grew tenfold in a day
and has burned 80 square miles (207 square km), torched at least 33
homes and six cabins, and forced the evacuation of 10,000 people. The
cause of the fire is not yet known. It remained zero percent contained
Thursday. </p>
<p>In northern Nevada, the worst danger appears to have passed near Reno
where a wildfire on the Sierra’s eastern front forced 20,000 evacuations
over the weekend. The blaze closed all schools for four days and
threatened to burn over the top of the mountains into the Lake Tahoe
basin. </p>
<p>Part of the state highway from Reno to Tahoe remained closed
Thursday. Authorities further relaxed evacuation orders after 600
firefighters held fire lines despite winds gusting up to 70 mph (112
kph) the day before and bolstered containment of the 9-square-mile
(23-square-kilometer) Davis Fire, now estimated at 37%. Most of the
8,000 residents that began the day under evacuation orders were
downgraded to evacuation warnings, allowing them to begin to return to
their homes. </p>
<p>“All containment lines … are holding at this time,” Jason Clawson, an
operations section chief for the federal firefighting team said at a
briefing in Reno late Thursday. “Absolutely no concerns. We have crews,
equipment, engines all spread out around the entire fire.”</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-13, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
China’s top legislature has approved a plan to raise the retirement age
as the country faces an aging workforce. It’s the first adjustment in
decades, one that many economists say is long overdue — but it’s not
universally popular. Plus, the current economic snapshot as the Fed
prepares for a crucial interest rate decision. And later, is canned
spaghetti carbonara a delicious innovation from Heinz or, as some
critics call it, an abomination?

id="analysts-say-vietnam-officials-us-trip-could-set-path-to-c-130-deal">Analysts
say Vietnam officials US trip could set path to C-130 deal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HO CHI MINH CITY — Analysts say this week’s visit to Washington by
Vietnamese Defense Minister Phan Van Giang shows advances in cooperation
between the two countries, despite rising Vietnamese nationalism that
may indicate rising anti-American sentiment in Vietnam.</p>
<p>A U.S.-based analyst told VOA on September 12 that Giang’s trip set
the groundwork for Hanoi to potentially purchase military cargo planes
from the United States this year.</p>
<p>Giang met with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon on
Monday. [September 9] Both leaders “reaffirmed the importance of the
U.S.-Vietnam partnership,” the Defense Department said in a statement,
and noted the one-year anniversary of the elevation of the countries’
ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership, the highest tier in
Hanoi’s diplomatic hierarchy.</p>
<p>The leaders also underscored the importance of working together to
address the lasting impacts of the U.S.-Vietnam War. Austin announced
that the U.S. would budget $65 million over the next five years to
complete the decontamination of Bien Hoa airbase of dioxin, bringing the
total from department to $215 million. The airbase was the primary
storage site for the toxic chemical Agent Orange during the U.S.-Vietnam
War and remains an environmental and public health hazard for those
nearby.</p>
<p>Andrew Wells-Dang, who leads the Vietnam War Legacies and
Reconciliation Initiative at the United States Institute of Peace, told
VOA by phone on September 5 that diplomatic visits are key to advancing
war-remediation efforts, including finding and identifying the remains
of missing soldiers. He said that along with the U.S. visit of Deputy
Defense Minister Vo Minh Luong in July, visits from authorities provide
“opportunity for them to have high level support.”</p>
<p>Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington
and an expert on Southeast Asia, said joint war-reconciliation efforts
also set the groundwork for defense cooperation more broadly.</p>
<p>“The United States is very pleased with the growth in bilateral
defense relations, and it started from very low levels and was built on
humanitarian missions,” Abuza said during the August 29 call.</p>
<p>“We’ve just continued to build on that,” he added.</p>
<p>Cargo planes</p>
<p>Reuters reported in July that Hanoi was considering purchasing
Lockheed Martin C-130 cargo planes from the U.S., according to unnamed
sources.</p>
<p>The U.S.-based analyst, who asked that his name to be withheld
because he has not been cleared to discuss the topic, said the C-130
deal was discussed but not finalized during Giang’s visit. The analyst
said the deal was held back by the “massive [U.S.] bureaucracy” and
because solidifying the purchase during the Washington visit would be
“too inflammatory for the Chinese.”</p>
<p>Ian Storey, senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in
Singapore, noted Vietnam’s delicate diplomatic balancing act,
illustrated by Giang’s travel itinerary before the Washington trip.</p>
<p>“Vietnam aims to keep its relations with the major powers in
balance,” he wrote in an email on August 30. “As such, Vietnamese
Defense Minister Phan Van Giang visited Russia and China in August.”</p>
<p>Storey added that the purchase of C-130 planes would not pose a
threat to China in its maritime territorial disputes with Vietnam.</p>
<p>“C-130 aircraft would enable the Vietnamese to transport troops and
supplies to its occupied atolls in the South China Sea, but these assets
are non-strategic and won’t shift the dynamics in the South China Sea,”
he wrote.</p>
<p>Nguyen The Phuong, a maritime security expert at the University of
New South Wales Canberra, said the C-130 purchase would be a “symbolic
move.”</p>
<p>“Vietnam will try to explore more areas of security and defense
cooperation between Vietnam and the United States to upgrade to a
higher, more meaningful level,” he told VOA on August 30. “The C-130
would be the symbol of that kind of evolving relationship,” he said.</p>
<p>Phuong said a C-130 is a likely entry point as there is still
mistrust between the former foes regarding lethal weapons, and the deal
would not rankle China too much.</p>
<p>“It could be quite advantageous for Vietnam,” he said of a potential
C-130 purchase. “Vietnam can improve its relationship with the United
States, and at the same time, we could not anger China because Vietnam
would just buy non-lethal weapons.”</p>
<p>Rising nationalism</p>
<p>Although there are positive signs to improving Hanoi-Washington
relations, there have also been recent instances of anti-Western
sentiment that could be an impediment to the countries relations, Phuong
said.</p>
<p>Fulbright University Vietnam, which has significant backing from the
United States, is facing accusations of fomenting a “color revolution,”
similar to the popular uprisings in former Soviet republics.</p>
<p>On August 21, Vietnam National Defense TV aired a critique of
Fulbright for allegedly not displaying the Vietnamese flag at a
graduation ceremony and facilitating a color revolution.</p>
<p>The report has since been taken down, but Phuong said the Fulbright
issue and other recent incidents show tension between Vietnam’s
conservative and liberal factions.</p>
<p>“It’s a presentation of a continuous struggle between different
factions, one conservative and one liberal,” Phuong said.</p>
<p>Abuza said that Vietnamese authorities may be attempting to tighten
control ahead of the anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War in
1975.</p>
<p>“Next April is the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon,” he said.
“The Vietnamese want to control that narrative 100%. There are a lot of
sensitivities.”</p>
<p>Along with the Fulbright incident, Phuong pointed to recent uproar
around Vietnamese celebrities who were pictured with the South Vietnam
flag while traveling to the United States. In addition, a Vietnamese
high school student faced cyber bullying and was summoned by police
after posting in September that he wanted to leave the country and would
“probably never see the [Communist] Party positively again.”</p>
<p>“There’s extreme nationalism in Vietnam at the moment,” Phuong said.
“It’s against Western values.”</p>

id="microsoft-vaguely-gestures-in-the-general-direction-of-giving-security-vendors-more-userspace-tools">Microsoft
vaguely gestures in the general direction of giving security vendors
more userspace tools</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>The consequences of the massive CrowdStrike failure for Windows are
slowly coming into focus. Microsoft recently held a security summit with
some of the large security software vendors, and the company is making
several rather vague promises about what it’s going to do to make sure
an incident like CrowdStrike never happens again. A key part of these
promises is the realisation that security software really shouldn’t be
running in the kernel, and to make that possible, MIcrosoft will need to
add several security features in userspace. Both our customers and
ecosystem partners have called on Microsoft to provide additional
security capabilities outside of kernel mode which, along with SDP, can
be used to create highly available security solutions. At the summit,
Microsoft and partners discussed the requirements and key challenges in
creating a new platform which can meet the needs of security vendors. ↫
David Weston at the Windows Blogs This is easier said than done, as
moving things from kernel to userspace tends to incur a performance
penalty, as well as making it harder to detect software with bad
intentions early enough. Microsoft is going to have do some serious
reworking of both the kernel and userspace when it comes to security
before it’ll be able to completely close up the kernel and make it
impossible for security software to mess around in kernelspace.
Microsoft doesn’t offer any concrete steps or measures quite yet, so
we’ll have to wait and see just how far they’re willing to go. There’s
really not much else to say at this point – empty platitudes, vague
promises, and tons of marketing speak don’t secure an operating system,
after all.</p>

Back in September of last year, seismic sensors all over the world began
detecting strange signals, the source of which researchers couldn’t
identify. For nine days, the whole Earth appeared to vibrate at regular
90-second intervals. Now, scientists say they’ve figured out what
happened: A massive landslide in Greenland, caused by a melting glacier,
sent huge volumes of debris plummeting into a fjord and triggered a
mega-tsunami. The energy from the wave remained trapped in the fjord for
nine days, the water sloshing back and forth and sending vibrations
rippling out across the entire globe. Here you can see before and after
pictures of the glacier and the mountain:

published yesterday in the journal <em>Science</em>, the researchers
explicitly link the event to climate change. Warming global temperatures
caused the glacier to become too thin to support the mountain, so it
collapsed. And they say there will be more events like these. “As we
continue to alter our planet’s climate, we must be prepared for
unexpected phenomena that challenge our current understanding and demand
new ways of thinking,” the researchers

<li>White House to host first Extreme Heat Summit today
</h3>
<p>
The White House today will host its first-ever Extreme Heat Summit,
where President Biden’s National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi will issue an
“Extreme Heat Call to Action,” urging leaders to step up their efforts
to protect communities from the dangers of rising temperatures brought
on by climate change. The summit comes on the heels of the hottest
summer ever recorded in the Northern Hemisphere, and as the West Coast
reels from wildfires made worse by drought and a record-breaking heat
wave.
</p>
<p>
The summit will gather a variety of stakeholders – including emergency
responders and health-care workers – to share takeaways and lessons from
2024’s extreme heat season, discuss how the government is helping and
could help more, and identify gaps and opportunities for building
extreme heat resilience ahead of next year. The White House will also
announce a new “Community Heat Action Checklist” to serve as a roadmap
to help leaders develop extreme heat plans.
</p>
<p>
“Climate-fueled extreme heat waves are showing up like wrecking balls in
our communities, silently wreaking havoc on lives and livelihoods,”
Zaidi said in a statement. “We recognize that this is climate change in
action, and in response are taking a comprehensive approach to
protecting both our people and infrastructure.” Investments from the
Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for helping
states adapt to the effects of climate change, including extreme heat,
total more than $50 billion.

takes stock of state efforts to ditch diesel-powered school buses for
electric fleets. Both federal and state funding is available to help
with this transition. The report, from the Environment America Research
and Policy Center and U.S. PIRG Education Fund, finds that California
has the most “committed” electric school buses – that is, buses that
have been awarded, ordered, delivered, or are already operational. The
state has 1,777 e-buses up and running or ready to deploy, and is still
waiting on nearly 2,000 more. These buses will serve more than 63,000
students. Also in the top five are New York, Illinois, Florida, and
Pennsylvania, but they each trail California by quite a lot. Wyoming and
Idaho are the only states with zero electric school buses. The report
has lots of recommendations and tools to help school districts upgrade
their fleets. It also urges students to pressure school boards to commit
to making the switch.

to</a> the <em>Financial Times</em>. Typical inhalers rely on
propellants made from hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, to deliver
life-saving drugs to users. But HFCs are potent greenhouse gases that
are more effective than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the
atmosphere. Pharma giant GSK estimates its Ventolin inhaler accounted
for nearly half of the company’s global carbon footprint in 2022,
releasing the equivalent of 4.6 million metric tons of CO2. It’s
developing a new inhaler that could have a 90% lower carbon footprint.
Similarly, AstraZeneca has a new inhaler in the works that could cut 1.3
million metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions annually. Both companies
are trying to file for regulatory approval either by the end of 2024, or
early next year.

<h2 id="white-house-takes-aim-at-chinese-fast-fashion">White House takes
aim at Chinese fast fashion</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The White House said on Thursday it is acting on
Democratic lawmakers’ demands to close what they see as a legal loophole
that allows manufacturers — most from China — to dodge tariffs on
low-priced goods and flood the U.S. with illegal and unsafe
products.</p>
<p>The Biden administration is targeting the “de minimis” exemption,
which allows parcels valued at less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty
free. More than 1 billion such parcels entered the U.S. in fiscal 2023,
U.S Customs and Border Protection said.</p>
<p>White House officials attribute the more than fivefold increase from
several years ago to the growth of Chinese e-commerce platforms such as
Shein and Temu, and administration officials name-checked both of those
popular fast-fashion retailers in a briefing with journalists on
Thursday.</p>
<p>Daleep Singh, deputy national security adviser for international
economics, said these moves to close the loophole would have a big
effect on Chinese apparel, and “will drastically reduce the number of
shipments entering through the de minimis exemption.”</p>
<p>This would likely hamper Americans’ ability to score items like an $8
T-shirt – available in a range of colors – that features a gunslinging,
pants-wearing cartoon cowboy duck who proclaims, “you just yee’d your
last haw.” Or a $6 crop top that reads, in English, LIVE LAUGH LOBOTOMY.
Or an $8 bra made of two fuzzy, dead-eyed cat faces shorn of their
noses, mouths, whiskers and facial expressions, strung together and tied
halter-style around the neck. Or an $8 item that can only be described
as a business-formal bra, as it is made entirely of ties. It is
available in a patchwork of leopard-, zebra- and tiger-print ties,
presumably for a formal office that is animal themed.</p>
<p>Singh added that the administration also seeks to tighten information
collection requirements and consumer safety standards – and block
products that don’t make the cut. And further, he said, the White House
is calling on Congress to pass a law this year to “comprehensively
reform the de minimis exemption.”</p>
<p>In a Wednesday letter, 126 House Democrats urged the president to use
his executive authority, saying they could not act “amid interminable
stagnation in Congress that has precluded legislation from passing.”</p>
<p>“While lawmakers would rather see the de minimis issue dealt with
legislatively, the Democrats on the call said their patience was wearing
thin,” the letter read. “Despite the fact that the concept of de minimis
reform has engendered broad bipartisan support, politicking has
precluded a concrete resolution.”</p>
<p>Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, one of the initiative’s
leaders, expressed concerns over fast fashion’s documented use of forced
labor to make their cut-rate clothing. Rights group Amnesty
International has reported that Shein, in particular, upholds
“questionable labor and human rights standards.”</p>
<p>Shein’s model, the group says, leans on subcontracting the making of
garments, which leaves no room for transparency or accountability for
worker conditions, and gives workers no right to unionize or
assemble.</p>
<p>Navtej Dhillon, deputy director of the National Economic Council,
also said the moves address concerns over fentanyl shipments and for
declining U.S. industry.</p>
<p>“Some foreign companies are attempting to use this pathway to ship
illegal and dangerous products for our health, avoid our health and
safety and consumer protection laws, and evade tariffs to undermine
American manufacturers,” he said. “Textile and apparel manufacturing
supports tens of thousands of jobs in key states like Georgia and North
Carolina. These American workers and manufacturers deserve to compete on
a level playing field.”</p>
<p>The congressional group pushing the administration cited approval
from law enforcement and industry groups.</p>
<p>“The de minimis loophole is severely exacerbating our nation’s opioid
crisis,” said Bill Johnson, executive director of the National
Association of Police Organizations. “Closing it would help staunch the
flow of fentanyl and other narcotics coming across our borders and help
safeguard the lives of our children, families, and friends.”</p>
<p>And Kim Glas, president and CEO of the National Council of Textile
Organizations, said the industry group “strongly supports closing the de
minimis loophole,” noting the closure of 18 textile plants in the U.S.
in the past year.</p>
<p>“De minimis is a free trade agreement for the world at the expense of
U.S. manufacturers, retailers, and consumers,” she said in a statement.
“Shockingly, it has now become a black market for dangerous products
facilitating fentanyl, precursors and pill presses. De minimis is
destruction.”</p>
<p>Shein said last year that they support “responsible reform” of the
policy but did not give precise recommendations.</p>
<p>“The de minimis exemption needs a complete makeover to create a level
playing field for all retailers,” SHEIN Executive Vice Chairman Donald
Tang said in a statement. “At the same time, American consumers deserve
to know that the products they purchase are authentic and ethically
produced. We believe de minimis reform can and should achieve both.”</p>

and British leaders meet as Ukraine pushes to ease weapons
restrictions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — United States President Joe Biden and British Prime
Minister Keir Starmer are meeting Friday amid an intensified push by
Ukraine to loosen restrictions on using weapons provided by the U.S. and
Britain to strike Russia. </p>
<p>The talks come amid signs that the White House could be moving toward
a shift in its policy, and as Russia’s President Vladimir Putin warned
that Ukraine’s use of long-range weapons would put NATO at war with
Moscow. </p>
<p>Ukrainian officials renewed their pleas to use Western-provided
long-range missiles against targets deeper inside Russia during this
week’s visit to Kyiv by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.K.
Foreign Secretary David Lammy. Blinken said he had “no doubt” that Biden
and Starmer would discuss the matter during their visit, noting the U.S.
has adapted and “will adjust as necessary” as Russia’s battlefield
strategy has changed. </p>
<p>The language is similar to what Blinken said in May, shortly before
the U.S. allowed Ukraine to use American-provided weapons just inside
Russian territory. The distance has been largely limited to cross-border
targets deemed a direct threat out of concerns about further escalating
the conflict. </p>
<p>While the issue is expected to be at the top of the leaders’ agenda,
it appeared unlikely that Biden and Starmer would announce any policy
changes during this week’s visit, according to two U.S. officials
familiar with planning for the leaders’ talks who spoke on condition of
anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the private
deliberations. </p>
<p>In addition to Blinken, Biden also has hinted a change could be
afoot. In an exchange with reporters earlier this week about whether he
was ready to ease weapons restrictions on Ukraine, he responded, “We’re
working that out now.” </p>
<p>Putin warned Thursday that allowing long-range strikes “would mean
that NATO countries, the United States, and European countries are at
war with Russia. … If this is so, then, bearing in mind the change in
the very essence of this conflict, we will make appropriate decisions
based on the threats that will be created for us.” </p>
<p>His remarks were in line with the narrative the Kremlin has actively
promoted since early in the Ukraine war, accusing NATO countries of
de-facto participation in the conflict and threatening a response. </p>
<p>Earlier in the year, Putin warned that Russia could provide
long-range weapons to others to strike Western targets in response to
NATO allies allowing Ukraine to use their arms to attack Russian
territory, saying it “would mark their direct involvement in the war
against the Russian Federation, and we reserve the right to act the same
way.” </p>
<p>Starmer, in response to the Russian leader’s Thursday comments, said
on his way to the U.S. that Britain does not seek any conflict with
Russia. </p>
<p>“Russia started this conflict. Russia illegally invaded Ukraine.
Russia could end this conflict straight away,” Starmer told reporters.
“Ukraine has the right to self-defense and we’ve obviously been
absolutely fully supportive of Ukraine’s right to self-defense — we’re
providing training capability, as you know.” </p>
<p>“But we don’t seek any conflict with Russia — that’s not our
intention in the slightest,” Starmer said. </p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has pressed U.S. and allied
military leaders to go much further. He argues that the U.S. must allow
Ukraine to target Russian air bases and launch sites far from the border
as Russia has stepped up assaults on Ukraine’s electricity grid and
utilities ahead of the coming winter. </p>
<p>Zelenskyy also wants more long-range weaponry from the United States,
including the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, for strikes
in Russia. </p>
<p>ATACMS wouldn’t be the answer to the main threat Ukraine faces from
long-range Russian glide bombs, which are being fired from more than 300
kilometers (185 miles) away, beyond the ATACMS’ reach, said Lt. Col.
Charlie Dietz, Pentagon spokesperson. </p>
<p>American officials also don’t believe they have enough of the weapon
systems available to provide Ukraine with the number to make a
substantive difference to conditions on the ground, one of the U.S.
officials said. </p>
<p>During a meeting of allied defense ministers last week, Defense
Secretary Lloyd Austin said he did not believe providing Ukraine with
long-range weapon systems would be a game-changer in the grueling war.
He noted that Ukraine has already been able to strike inside Russia with
its own internally produced systems, including drones. </p>
<p>“I don’t believe one capability is going to be decisive, and I stand
by that comment,” Austin said. </p>
<p>“As of right now, the policy has not changed,” Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder,
Pentagon press secretary, said Thursday. </p>
<p>Starmer said he was visiting Washington for “strategic meetings to
discuss Ukraine and to discuss the Middle East.” It’s the prime
minister’s second meeting with Biden since his center-left government
was elected in July. </p>
<p>It comes after Britain last week diverged from the U.S. by suspending
some arms exports to Israel because of the risk they could be used to
break international law. Both countries have downplayed their
differences over the issue. </p>
<p>Biden and Starmer’s meeting also comes ahead of this month’s annual
meeting of global leaders at the United Nations General Assembly. The
Oval Office meeting was scheduled in part to help the two leaders
compare notes on the war in Ukraine, languishing efforts to get a
cease-fire deal in Gaza and other issues ahead of the U.N. meeting. </p>
<p>The White House also has sought in recent days to put a greater
emphasis on the nexus between the war in Ukraine and conflict in the
Middle East sparked after Iranian-backed Hamas militants in Gaza
launched attacks on Israel on Oct. 7. </p>
<p>The Biden administration said this week that Iran recently delivered
short-range ballistic weapons to Russia to use against Ukraine, a
transfer that White House officials worry will allow Russia to use more
of its arsenal for targets far beyond the Ukrainian front line while
employing Iranian warheads for closer-range targets. </p>
<p>In turn, the U.S. administration says Russia has been tightening its
relationship with Iran, including by providing it with nuclear and space
technology. </p>
<p>“This is obviously deeply concerning,” White House national security
spokesperson John Kirby said of the missile transfer. “And it certainly
speaks to the manner in which this partnership threatens European
security and how it illustrates Iran’s destabilizing influence now
reaches well beyond the Middle East.”</p>

id="boeing-factory-workers-go-on-strike-after-rejecting-contract-offer">Boeing
factory workers go on strike after rejecting contract offer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SEATTLE — Aircraft assembly workers walked off the job early Friday
at Boeing factories near Seattle after union members voted
overwhelmingly to go on strike and reject a tentative contract that
would have increased wages by 25% over four years.</p>
<p>The strike started at 12:01 a.m. PDT, less than three hours after the
local branch of the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers announced 94.6% of voting workers rejected the
proposed contract and 96% approved the work stoppage, easily surpassing
a two-thirds requirement.</p>
<p>The labor action involves 33,000 Boeing machinists, most of them in
Washington state, and is expected to shut down production of the
company’s best-selling airline planes. The strike will not affect
commercial flights but represents another setback for the aerospace
giant, whose reputation and finances have been battered by manufacturing
problems and multiple federal investigations this year.</p>
<p>The striking machinists assemble the 737 Max, Boeing’s best-selling
airliner, along with the 777, or “triple-seven” jet, and the 767 cargo
plane at factories in Renton and Everett, Washington. The walkout likely
will not stop production of Boeing 787 Dreamliners, which are built by
nonunion workers in South Carolina.</p>
<p>The machinists make $75,608 per year on average, not counting
overtime, and that would rise to $106,350 at the end of the four-year
contract, according to Boeing.</p>
<p>However, the deal fell short of the union’s initial demand for pay
raises of 40% over three years. The union also wanted to restore
traditional pensions that were axed a decade ago but settled for an
increase in Boeing contributions to employee’s 401(k) retirement
accounts.</p>
<p>Outside the Renton factory, people stood with signs reading,
“Historic contract my ass” and “Have you seen the damn housing prices?”
Car horns honked and a boom box played songs such as Twisted Sister’s
We’re Not Gonna Take It and Taylor Swift’s Look What You Made Me Do.</p>
<p>Boeing responded to the strike announcement by saying it was “ready
to get back to the table to reach a new agreement.”</p>
<p>“The message was clear that the tentative agreement we reached with
IAM leadership was not acceptable to the members. We remain committed to
resetting our relationship with our employees and the union,” the
company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Very little has gone right for Boeing this year, from a panel blowing
out and leaving a gaping hole in one of its passenger jets in January to
NASA leaving two astronauts in space rather sending them home on a
problem-plagued Boeing spacecraft.</p>
<p>As long as the strike lasts, it will deprive the company of
much-needed cash it gets from delivering new planes to airlines. That
will be another challenge for new Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, who six
weeks ago was given the job of turning around a company that has lost
more than $25 billion in the last six years and fallen behind European
rival Airbus.</p>
<p>Ortberg made a last-ditch effort to salvage a deal that had unanimous
backing from the union’s negotiators. He told machinists Wednesday that
“no one wins” in a walkout and a strike would put Boeing’s recovery in
jeopardy and raise more doubt about the company in the eyes of its
airline customers.</p>
<p>“For Boeing, it is no secret that our business is in a difficult
period, in part due to our own mistakes in the past,” he said. “Working
together, I know that we can get back on track, but a strike would put
our shared recovery in jeopardy, further eroding trust with our
customers and hurting our ability to determine our future together.”</p>
<p>The head of the union local, IAM District 751 President Jon Holden,
said Ortberg faced a difficult position because machinists were bitter
about stagnant wages and concessions they have made since 2008 on
pensions and health care to prevent the company from moving jobs
elsewhere.</p>
<p>“This is about respect, this is about the past, and this is about
fighting for our future,” Holden said in announcing the strike.</p>
<p>The vote also was a rebuke to Holden and union negotiators, who
recommended workers approve the contract offer. Holden, who had
predicted workers would vote to strike, said the union would survey
members to decide which issues they want to stress when negotiations
resume.</p>

charged in police breakup of pro-Palestinian camp at US university</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ann arbor, michigan — Authorities have filed charges against nine
people who are accused of trespassing or resisting police during the May
breakup of a pro-Palestinian camp at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>“The First Amendment does not provide a cover for illegal activity,”
Attorney General Dana Nessel said Thursday, a day after charges were
filed in Washtenaw County.</p>
<p>The camp on the Diag, known for decades as a site for campus
protests, was cleared by police on May 21 after a month. Video posted
online showed police using what appeared to be an irritant to spray
people, who were forced to retreat.</p>
<p>The university said the camp had become a threat to safety, with
overloaded power sources and open flames.</p>
<p>Nessel said two people were charged with trespassing, a misdemeanor,
and seven more people were charged with trespassing as well as resisting
police, a felony.</p>
<p>Protesters have demanded that the school’s endowment stop investing
in companies with ties to Israel. But the university insists it has no
direct investments and less than $15 million placed with funds that
might include companies in Israel. That’s less than 0.1% of the total
endowment.</p>
<p>U.S. Representative Rashida Tlaib, a Detroit Democrat who supports
the protesters, said the charges were “frivolous” and a “shameful
attack” on the rights of students.</p>
<p>Separately, Nessel said state prosecutors charged two people for
alleged acts during a counterdemonstration on April 25, a few days after
the camp was created.</p>
<p>Nessel said authorities still were investigating spring protests at
the homes of elected members of the university’s governing board.</p>

interview: House committee chairman speaks on Afghan withdrawal
report</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Representative Michael McCaul’s office recently
released detailed findings of an investigation into the chaotic August
2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, which has been criticized for
poor planning.</p>
<p>Speaking with Saba Shah Khan of VOA’s Urdu Service, McCaul, a Texas
Republican who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
denied that the latest probe was a “political exercise” that coincides
with a tight presidential race. He said its purpose was to ensure that
“an evacuation will never happen like this again.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the committee’s ranking Democrat, Representative Gregory
Meeks from New York, issued a statement criticizing the report as a
collection of “cherry-picked witness testimony” that excludes “anything
unhelpful to a predetermined, partisan narrative about the Afghanistan
withdrawal.”</p>
<p>“The Majority did not involve the Minority in this report, nor have
they even provided a draft copy to us,” he wrote.</p>
<p>In the following interview, McCaul accuses White House officials of
“stonewalling” the investigation and mentions his September 3 decision
to subpoena Secretary of State Antony Blinken for testimony even though
findings of the full report were released Monday.</p>
<p>“We’re still not finished with the investigation,” McCaul told VOA on
Tuesday.</p>
<p>State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller last week issued a
statement to The Hill stating that Blinken was unable to testify on the
dates requested and offered “reasonable alternatives” to comply with
McCaul’s request.</p>
<p>The following has been edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p>VOA: Why is the Foreign Affairs Committee report on U.S. withdrawal
from Afghanistan being released now? With less than two months left to
Election Day, some would say the report is politically driven.</p>
<p>U.S. Representative Michael McCaul: It’s been three years since the …
chaotic evacuation. The first year, the majority — at that time, the
Democrats — did nothing to investigate. So, I’ve had two years to put
this very comprehensive, complete, historic account of what happened
together. In the meantime, we served many subpoenas. We’ve had to
threaten contempt proceedings. And I would have liked to have had this
done a year ago. The administration has been, you know, stonewalling us
and slowing down the delivery of the report. In fact, we’re still not
finished with the investigation.</p>
<p>VOA: In light of the report, what do you think the Biden
administration could have done differently to avoid the chaos and mayhem
that unfolded during the withdrawal?</p>
<p>McCaul: That’s one of the key takeaways here. The military is on the
ground doing their job. That’s to pull out by July [as dictated by a
predetermined date of withdrawal negotiated by the prior
administration]. The intelligence community sees what’s happening. They
report this information. It gets a little bit manipulated when it gets
to the higher level. And then it is amplified that everything’s fine in
Afghanistan, when, in fact, on the ground, the conditions are getting
very bad.</p>
<p>The State Department is required by law to come out with an
evacuation plan called the NEO [Noncombatant Evacuation Operations].
They kept resisting this because they thought evacuation means failure.
So, they wait until the very day that the Taliban is overrunning Kabul
before they finally initiate an evacuation plan. That is why it was so
chaotic. That is why the 13 servicemen and women were left behind — with
Taliban, by the way — to work with them to help Afghans get out.</p>
<p>VOA: The report says that [President Joe] Biden kept Zalmay Khalilzad
on as special representative [for Afghanistan reconciliation from
September 2018 to October 2021], making it clear Biden embraced the
[February 2020] Doha Accord. Sir, was that a good decision?</p>
<p>McCaul: The complaint I had — and Zal and I, you know, I’ve known him
for a long time, and I have respect for him — but he did not include the
Afghan government in the Doha talks. So, it was just between Zal
Khalilzad and the Taliban. That sent a terrible message to the Afghan
government. They felt like they were sidelined. … The Doha Agreement had
conditions. Most important is the Taliban cannot hit U.S. forces. They
were continuing to do that. But according to President Biden’s press guy
[former State Department spokesperson Ned Price], Doha was “immaterial”
as to the evacuation. He was going to go to zero — that means zero
troops, zero contractors, zero air power — one way or the other. That
was going to happen. He made that decision on day one.</p>
<p>VOA: The [Doha] negotiations and the decision to leave Afghanistan
was made during the Trump administration. Chairman, do you think….</p>
<p>McCaul: … that isn’t accurate, because the Taliban were in violation
of the Doha conditions. Twenty-five hundred troops were left on the
ground — General [Kenneth] McKenzie and [Mark] Milly said that was
sufficient to stabilize, along with 6,500 NATO and air power and
contractors. That they could stabilize both Bagram and HKIA [Hamid
Karzai International Airport] when it went to zero. That’s when it
changed.</p>
<p>VOA: The date of withdrawal was decided by the Trump
administration…</p>
<p>McCaul: … if conditions were met, which they weren’t …</p>
<p>VOA: … do you think that it is fair to hold the Biden administration
solely responsible for the failure?</p>
<p>McCaul: And we don’t. We actually fault Zal Khalilzad. We list a lot
of top D.O.D. [Department of Defense] and State Department officials
that Congress, in a resolution, will condemn for their actions. Zal
Khalilzad, he’s a dear friend, but by not letting the Afghan government
participate — to me, that was a major error. And a lot of this, by not
executing a plan of action to get out and evacuate, according to the top
generals and the intelligence community, was the fatal flaw, leaving
behind Americans, Afghan allies, and most importantly, the women.</p>
<p>VOA: The report also says that the U.S. did not keep track of whether
the Taliban were following the Doha Agreement. In your opinion, how
could the U.S. have made Taliban comply?</p>
<p>McCaul: In my opinion, they were in violation at the time the
president made the decision to go to zero. But according to his press
spokesperson, that was immaterial to the withdrawal. It was going to
happen one way or the other. What people don’t understand is it’s not
just the military being pulled out, it’s the air cover, it’s the
contractors. When everything is pulled out, the Afghan army was
virtually defenseless.</p>
<p>VOA: It is also said in the report that Afghanistan is a hotbed of
terrorist activities. Can U.S. leave Taliban to their doings? And what
is the way forward?</p>
<p>McCaul: It’s very, very dangerous. I was the chairman of Homeland
Security Committee. What we’re seeing now, and we saw it before, is the
Haqqani [network and] Taliban protecting Zawahiri, [the] number two
Al-Qaeda [figure], who was taken by drone strike not too long after the
evacuation. We know that they were collaborating — ISIS-K and Taliban —
because United States is a common enemy.</p>
<p>Most disturbingly is Bagram, the prisons in Bagram. They [the
Taliban] released thousands of ISIS prisoners that have now gone to the
Khorasan region — that’s Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan — [for]
external operations. Just recently, the FBI indicated to us that eight
of them have been detained in the United States coming across the
southwest border. … So, when Americans think Afghanistan is some
faraway, distant land, it is all interconnected and it does threaten the
homeland.</p>
<p>VOA: What is the way forward? What do you think the U.S. strategy
should be to handle this?</p>
<p>McCaul: Number one, we don’t want to see this happen again. This was
not a political exercise for me. As a [former] federal prosecutor, I
just wanted to get to the facts and the evidence, wherever that took me.
I didn’t have conclusions in advance. … So, to answer your question, we
want to propose a new way to do this legislatively, through Congress, so
that an evacuation will never happen like this again. Saigon was bad.
This is worse.</p>
<p>VOA: The report quotes a study that 118 girls were sold as child
brides in Afghanistan, in a village. And, in the same village, 116
parents are waiting for a buyer. So, my question to you is that it seems
like there is no hope for women and girls in Afghanistan. What is your
suggestion? And what can the U.S do?</p>
<p>McCaul: I mean, can you imagine being 25 years old as a woman and
never lived under Sharia law, and now you have to go backwards to the
stone age? And that’s essentially what has happened there. I got four
busloads of the American School of Music girls out through Abbey Gate,
because I knew the Taliban — the way they feel about women and music —
their days would be numbered. Now, it’s very difficult. Do you normalize
the Taliban? Do you treat them as a foreign terrorist organization?</p>
<p>I think any aid or assistance we give to Afghanistan has to be
conditioned on treatment of women and children. And they should be
allowed to go to school, they should be allowed to go outside their
homes, they should not be beaten. Just fundamental rights.</p>

id="exclusive-interview-us-boosts-diplomacy-security-support-in-somalia">Exclusive
interview: US boosts diplomacy, security support in Somalia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MOGADISHU, SOMALIA/WASHINGTON — In an exclusive interview, U.S.
Ambassador to Somalia Richard Riley shed light on the ongoing diplomatic
efforts and security challenges facing the East African nation,
including U.S. efforts to find a peaceful diplomatic solution to the
ongoing dispute between Somalia and Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Somalia and Ethiopia have been in a dispute that was ignited at the
beginning of this year when Ethiopia signed a memorandum of
understanding, or MoU, with the breakaway region of Somaliland — a deal
Somalia sees as an infringement on its sovereignty.</p>
<p>The agreement gives Ethiopia leasing rights to a large portion of the
Red Sea coastline in Somaliland.</p>
<p>During the interview conducted at the U.S. Embassy in Mogadishu,
Riley, who was sworn in to his post in May, shared with VOA his insights
on the U.S. commitment to finding peaceful resolutions and supporting
the Somali government in combating terrorism.</p>
<p>Diplomatic resolution</p>
<p>“We are very much aware and working collaboratively to make sure
there is a diplomatic resolution of this current situation,” he said.
“It is an unfortunate situation, very disruptive, and started … with
this MoU between Somaliland and Ethiopia. Of course, we do not recognize
it, and we are trying to solve it through diplomatic channels.”</p>
<p>Turkey, a key Somali partner, has been trying to mediate the dispute
between the neighboring countries, holding two rounds of talks in Ankara
that ended without an agreement.</p>
<p>The Ethiopian and Somali foreign ministers who represented their
countries at the meeting did not hold direct talks. Turkey’s foreign
minister shuttled between them.</p>
<p>Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan described the talks at the time
as “candid, cordial and forward-looking.”</p>
<p>Abdi Aynte, a former Somali minister of planning and international
cooperation who was involved in the negotiations, said the only thing
the two sides agreed upon was to reconvene on September 17.</p>
<p>“The core issue remains Ethiopia’s refusal to annul the MoU with
Somaliland, which is Somalia’s position, and if Ethiopia continues to
insist on its position of not withdrawing from the MoU, I think there is
nothing to expect from any talks between the two countries,” Aynte
said.</p>
<p>Another analyst who spoke with VOA earlier this year, Cameron Hudson,
who is a researcher at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and
International Studies, questioned the United States’ commitment and
ability to quell tensions in the volatile region.</p>
<p>Riley said he is hopeful, though, that a solution may come from the
third round of talks in Turkey.</p>
<p>“There are negotiations ongoing,” he said.</p>
<p>Concerns about potential conflict</p>
<p>Fears have been growing in Somalia that the boiling tensions could
turn into an armed conflict between Ethiopian soldiers currently
stationed in Somalia and Somalis.</p>
<p>Riley said such confrontation is “unacceptable.”</p>
<p>“No one can accept there would be any kind of conflict, much less
war,” he said. “That is why everybody in the international community is
working nonstop. We certainly are, from the United States and from
Washington, to find the proper resolution of this conflict between
Ethiopia and Somalia. This is absolutely needed. It is needed soon very
quickly, and you have the full power and support, Somalia does, to make
sure there is a proper diplomatic solution.”</p>
<p>Ethiopian troops became part of the African Union mission, known as
ATMIS, in Somalia in January 2012. Under the mission, at least 3,000
Ethiopian soldiers officially operate as part of an AU peacekeeping
mission fighting al-Shabab. An additional 5,000 to 7,000 Ethiopian
soldiers are stationed in several regions under a bilateral
agreement.</p>
<p>Last month, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution
2748, which allows ATMIS troops to stay in Somalia through December
2024.</p>
<p>Somalia says all Ethiopian troops should be out of the country by the
end of 2024, especially after the expiration of ATMIS. Somali Prime
Minister Hamza Abdi Barre said last month that Ethiopian forces would
not be part of the upcoming African Union Support Mission in Somalia, or
AUSSOM, unless Ethiopia withdraws from the controversial memorandum of
understanding.</p>
<p>Commitment to Somalia’s security</p>
<p>Riley said the U.S. is Somalia’s largest donor and security partner,
providing tens of billions of dollars over the years in personnel,
equipment and funding. “The United States, for example, just forgave
over $1 million of Somali sovereign debt,” he said.</p>
<p>He added that the U.S. will extend full support to any mission whose
objective is to make Somalia a peaceful place.</p>
<p>“We absolutely have always strongly supported the current ATMIS force
here. We are very grateful to the troop-contributing countries, who have
provided very brave personnel for many years to assist the federal
government to bring stability and security here,” Riley said. “We are
looking forward to this transition so that it is a proper one, it is
well organized, and it is efficient, and it does the job. That is the
main issue to make sure that the mandate of the follow-on force under
AUSSOM will be suited to the need.”</p>
<p>Two urgent issues</p>
<p>He said there are imperative challenges in Somalia that the U.S.
wants to help the country handle.</p>
<p>“There are two immediate urgencies: to ensure that the Somali
National Army and armed forces, including the police, receive all the
resources they need to fight against horrific terrorist groups like
al-Shabab and ISIS,” he said. “The other challenge is to ensure that the
economy of Somalia continues to grow, with more investment and
connectivity to international markets. Somalia needs both physical and
economic security.”</p>

attorney general says he won’t let Justice Department be used as
political weapon</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Attorney General Merrick Garland said Thursday he will
not allow the Justice Department “to be used as a political weapon,” as
he denounced “conspiracy theories” and “dangerous falsehoods” targeting
federal law enforcement. </p>
<p>Speaking to U.S. attorneys gathered in Washington and other Justice
Department members, Garland forcefully defended the department’s
integrity and impartiality against claims of politicization by
Republicans. Garland said norms protecting the department from political
interference matter “now more than ever.” </p>
<p>“Our norms are a promise that we will not allow this department to be
used as a political weapon. And our norms are a promise that we will not
allow this nation to become a country where law enforcement is treated
as an apparatus of politics,” Garland said to applause in the Great Hall
at Justice Department headquarters. </p>
<p>Garland’s comments come amid an onslaught of attacks from
Republicans, who claim the Justice Department has been politically
weaponized to go after former President Donald Trump. Trump was indicted
in two separate criminal cases by special counsel Jack Smith, who
Garland brought in from outside the department to run the
investigations. </p>
<p>Trump has vowed if returned to the White House in November to
“completely overhaul” what he has described as the “corrupt Department
of Injustice.” He has also threatened to jail those “involved in
unscrupulous behavior” this election, writing in a recent post on X that
they will face “long term prison sentences so that this Depravity of
Justice does not happen again.” </p>
<p>Garland did not mention Trump or Republicans in his speech. But he
condemned what he described as “outrageous” attacks he says put law
enforcement in harm’s way. </p>
<p>“These attacks have come in the form of conspiracy theories,
dangerous falsehoods, efforts to bully and intimidate career public
servants by repeatedly and publicly singling them out, and threats of
actual violence,” Garland said. “Through your continued work, you have
made clear that the Justice Department will not be intimidated by these
attacks.” </p>
<p>Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has repeatedly used
social media to go after Smith and other prosecutors as well as the
judges handling his cases. Republicans have also falsely claimed that
the New York criminal case, in which Trump was convicted of 34 felony
counts in May, was orchestrated by Democratic President Joe Biden and
the Justice Department. </p>
<p>Garland came into office pledging to restore the department’s
reputation for political independence after four tumultuous years under
Trump. But he has faced an onslaught of criticism over his department’s
handling of politically sensitive cases, including the prosecution of
Biden’s son Hunter, who pleaded guilty last week to federal tax charges
in a case brought by a different special counsel. </p>
<p>Garland said that department employees have made clear through their
work that they “do not bend to politics” and that they “will not break
under pressure.” </p>
<p>“We must treat like cases alike,” Garland said, adding. “There is not
one rule for friends and another for foes, one rule for the powerful and
another for the powerless, one rule for the rich and another for the
poor, one rule for Democrats and another for Republicans, or different
rules depending on one’s race or ethnicity.</p>
<p>“To the contrary, we have only one rule: we follow the facts and
apply the law in a way that respects the Constitution and protects civil
liberties.”</p>

<h2 id="us-imposes-sanctions-on-cambodian-tycoon-over-scam-centers">US
imposes sanctions on Cambodian tycoon over scam centers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The United States announced sanctions on Thursday on
Cambodian businessman and ruling party senator Ly Yong Phat as well as
several entities over alleged abuses related to workers who were
trafficked and forced to work in online scam centers.</p>
<p>The move comes at a delicate phase in relations between the United
States and Cambodia, which has moved ever closer to Washington’s
strategic rival China despite U.S. efforts to woo its new leader Hun
Manet, son of longtime strongman Hun Sen.</p>
<p>Ly Yong Phat was appointed Hun Sen’s personal adviser in 2022.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control said
the sanctions targeted Ly’s L.Y.P. Group Co. conglomerate and O-Smach
Resort.</p>
<p>It said it was also sanctioning Cambodia-based Garden City Hotel, Koh
Kong Resort, and Phnom Penh Hotel for being owned or controlled by
Ly.</p>
<p>Bradley Smith, the Treasury’s acting under secretary for terrorism
and financial intelligence, said the move was made to “hold accountable
those involved in human trafficking and other abuses, while also
disrupting their ability to operate investment fraud schemes that target
countless unsuspecting individuals, including Americans.”</p>
<p>Cambodia and other countries in Southeast Asia have emerged in recent
years as the epicenter of a multibillion-dollar criminal industry
targeting victims across the world with fraudulent crypto and other
schemes, often operating from fortified compounds run by Chinese
syndicates and staffed by trafficked workers.</p>
<p>The Treasury statement said scammers leverage fictitious identities
and elaborate narratives to develop trusted relationships and deceive
victims.</p>
<p>In many cases, this involves convincing victims to invest in virtual
currency, or in some cases, over-the-counter foreign exchange schemes,
it said.</p>
<p>The statement said traffickers force victims to work up to 15 hours a
day and, in some cases, “resell” victims to other scam operations or
subject them to sex trafficking.</p>
<p>It noted that the U.S. State Department’s annual Trafficking in
Persons Report this year highlighted abuses in O’Smach and Koh Kong and
that official complicity in trafficking crimes remained widespread,
resulting in selective and often politically motivated enforcement of
laws.</p>
<p>Americans have been targeted by many of the scams. In 2022, in the
U.S alone, victims reported losses of $2.6 billion from pig butchering –
a type of long-term scam – and other crypto fraud, more than double the
previous year, according to the FBI.</p>
<p>The Treasury reportsaid that for more than two years the O-Smach
Resort has been investigated by police and publicly reported on “for
extensive and systemic serious human rights abuse.”</p>
<p>It said victims reported being lured there with false employment
opportunities, having phones and passports confiscated upon arrival and
being forced to work scam operations.</p>
<p>“People who called for help reported being beaten, abused with
electric shocks, made to pay a hefty ransom, or threatened with being
sold to other online scam gangs,” it said, adding that there had been
two reports of victims jumping to their death from buildings within the
resort.</p>
<p>The report said local authorities had conducted repeated rescue
missions, including in October 2022 and March 2024, freeing victims of
various nationalities, including Chinese, Indian, Indonesian, Malaysian,
Singaporean, Thai and Vietnamese.</p>
<p>The U.S state department said in June that Cambodian government
officials were complicit in trafficking and that some officials owned
facilities used by scam operators.</p>
<p>Spokespeople for Cambodia’s government and foreign ministry did not
answer phone calls or respond to messages seeking comment when asked
about the sanctions.</p>
<p>The U.S. and other governments have repeatedly engaged with Cambodia
to put an end to the scam centers.</p>
<p>Washington had considered sanctions for months, sources briefed on
the matter told Reuters. They said the decision was initially expected
earlier this year but had been delayed.</p>
<p>A change of leadership to West Point-educated Hun Manet last year was
seen by U.S. officials as an opportunity to mend ties with Cambodia, but
despite U.S. efforts, its ties with China have steadily grown. Beijing
sent warships to Cambodia this year and is backing the expansion of a
key naval base.</p>

<h2 id="biden-to-host-quad-summit-in-delaware">Biden to host Quad summit
in Delaware</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>White House — President Joe Biden will host his second and final Quad
leaders’ summit in his home state of Delaware on September 21, the White
House announced Thursday. </p>
<p>Biden is planning to host the three other leaders of the group, Prime
Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of
India, and Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan. The summit will be
held on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, happening
concurrently in New York. </p>
<p>The leaders are expected to enhance cooperation including the
existing Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness, a key
initiative aimed at countering China’s aggression in the South China
Sea. </p>
<p>“The Quad Leaders Summit will focus on bolstering the strategic
convergence among our countries, advancing our shared vision of a free
and open Indo-Pacific region, and delivering concrete benefits for
partners in the Indo-Pacific in key areas,” said White House
spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre in a statement Thursday. </p>
<p>Biden hosted the first Quad leaders’ summit at the White House in
2021. The group has since met twice more in person in Japan. In a
reflection of the importance of the group, Biden has hosted all the
leaders for subsequent state visits at the White House. </p>
<p>India was scheduled to host this year, but the four leaders agreed
that New Delhi will instead do so in 2025. </p>
<p>“President Biden’s visit to India in September 2023 for the G20
summit meant that it was difficult for him to return to India in January
2024, on the sidelines of India’s Republic Day in January 2024, as per
India’s original planning,” said Aparna Pande, director of the Hudson
Institute’s Initiative on the Future of India and South Asia. </p>
<p>Both India and the U.S. then became caught up in their own electoral
cycles, making travel and summit-hosting respectively challenging, Pande
told VOA. </p>
<p>With Biden and Kishida set to leave office, the Wilmington summit
will be the last gathering of the current leaders. Whoever wins the U.S.
November election, whether Vice President Kamala Harris or former
President Donald Trump, will be invited to the Delhi summit next
year.</p>

<h2 id="what-california-is-telling-us-about-the-ev-market">What
California Is Telling Us About the EV Market</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-12, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzYxMjY5MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NTUzNDE2OH0.17EDDb7en-rKCkEsRErwDffQBt-SyvKKCsDMz7EyBkk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
As California goes, so goes the American car scene. This sentiment has
long been true, given that the Golden State is the country’s biggest
automotive market and its
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-climate-vehicle-emissions-rules-b649b3fe05a97876a51b55a52af7ea1e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>emissions
rules</u></a> have helped to drag the car industry toward more efficient
vehicles.
</p>
<p>
It is doubly true in the EV era, since California is where electric
vehicles first went big and where electric adoption far outpaces the
rest of the nation. A look at the
<a href="https://www.cncda.org/wp-content/uploads/Cal-Covering-2Q-24.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>car
sales data</u></a> from the first half of 2024 shows us a few things
about what the electric car market is and where it’s headed.
</p>
<h2>
The EV Sales Pause Is Here. For the Moment.
</h2>
<p>
Electric cars went mainstream in a hurry here, growing from 5.8% of
California car sales in 2020 to 21.5% in 2023. Then the graph flattens
out: For the first half of this year, EVs made up 21.4% of new
registrations. That would seem to support the
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/09/10/ev-sales-have-not-fallen-cooled-slowed-or-slumped-stop-lying-in-headlines/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gloomy
narrative</u></a> of a supposed EV sales slump. The truth, as it tends
to be, is more complicated.
</p>
<p>
Look at the numbers broken down by quarters, rather than years, and the
chart looks a little different. EV sales reached a peak in the third
quarter of 2023, dipped a bit, and then jumped back up in April to June
2024 to the second-best quarter ever. That’s a blip, not a crisis, as
EVs appear poised for slow growth but growth nonetheless.
</p>
<p>
Consider the context for a moment: California reached a place where 1 in
5 new cars sold are electric even with the EV affordability problem.
That trend wasn’t going to continue unabated up to 30, 40, or 50% of
auto sales without the industry putting out vehicles that can compete on
cost with a $25,000 Honda Civic or a $30,000 Toyota RAV4. In its summary
of the numbers, the California New Car Dealers Association blames
inflation and rising monthly car payments for suppressing
<em><em>all</em></em> vehicle sales at the moment, EVs included. Money
matters will decide where things go from here.
</p>
<h2>
Yup, Hybrids Are Up.
</h2>
<p>
The flipside of this year’s EV doomerism is the notion that drivers are
turning to hybrids instead. The numbers bear out that sentiment for the
moment in California. Traditional hybrid vehicles (excluding plug-in
hybrids) more than doubled their market share from 6.1% in 2020 to 13.2%
in the first half of 2024. Not too surprising, considering their wide
availability and how appealing they are for California drivers who buy
some of the nation’s most expensive gasoline.
</p>
<p>
Plug-in hybrids accounted for 3.4% of sales in the first half of this
year, not far from the number they posted back in 2021. That might sound
odd, given automakers’ rumblings about turning to these vehicles instead
of true EVs, but a new wave of PHEVs is still in development. For now,
the difficult calculus remains: Plug-in hybrids are a great choice for a
lot of drivers, but they are significantly more expensive than
combustion cars for not much electric range, and PHEVs can be hard to
come by.
</p>
<p>
Take all these electrified powertrains together, however, and the
picture is clear. Compared to 2018, when gas- and diesel-burners made up
88.4% of auto sales, that number is down to 62% for the first half of
this year. Combustion-only is sinking fast, a trend that will spread
from the West Coast to the rest of the nation.
</p>
<h2>
Rivian Is Ascendant. Tesla, Not So Much.
</h2>
<p>
My eyes don’t deceive me. Since the start of 2024, it has felt like
Rivian’s trucks and especially SUVs are all over Los Angeles, driven by
the kind of people who used to own Range Rovers. It turns out RJ
Scaringe’s company is the fastest-growing car brand of any kind in
California, with sales up nearly 77% in the first half of 2024 compared
to the same period in 2023.
</p>
<p>
Now, that number is deceiving. It’s easy to grow by big percentages at
the beginning, and Rivian’s sales numbers are relatively small: It moved
just shy of 7,000 vehicles through June, which pales in comparison to
the 100,000 Teslas and 150,000 Toyotas registered in California during
the same period. But Rivian’s early success in California suggests the
brand is finding traction and that it might pick off plenty of drivers
from Tesla’s bread-winning Model Y once the more reasonably priced
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/subaru-rivian-r3-suv" target="_self"><u>R2
and R3</u></a> arrive.
</p>
<p>
After all, the story of the supposed EV slump is actually the story of
Tesla
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-shareholder-vote" target="_self"><u>squandering</u></a>
its huge halftime lead. Ford, Toyota, Mercedes, Rivian, BMW, and
Hyundai/Kia EV sales are
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/09/10/ev-sales-have-not-fallen-cooled-slowed-or-slumped-stop-lying-in-headlines/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>up</u></a>
this year, but Tesla’s slump wipes out much of their gains.
</p>
<p>
The Model Y and Model 3 remain California’s best-selling EVs by far,
with the second-place Model 3 selling three times the volume of the
third-place finisher, Hyundai’s Ioniq 5. Yet Tesla sales in California
are down 17% from the first half of 2023, and its market share dropped
from 64.6% to 53.4%. Its only new model, the Cybertruck, sold 3,048 in
the first half of this year. Californians bought nearly a thousand more
Chevy Bolts — and GM
<a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/next-generation-chevrolet-bolt-coming-2025-mary-barra/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>isn’t
even building that car</u></a> right now.

id="new-york-city-police-commissioner-to-resign-after-his-phone-was-seized-in-federal-investigation">New
York City police commissioner to resign after his phone was seized in
federal investigation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — New York City Police Commissioner Edward Caban said he
would resign Thursday, one week after it emerged that his phone was
seized as part of a federal investigation that touched several members
of Mayor Eric Adams’ inner circle.</p>
<p>Caban said he made the decision to resign after the “news around
recent developments” had “created a distraction for our department,”
according to an email to the police department obtained by The
Associated Press.</p>
<p>“I am unwilling to let my attention be on anything other than our
important work, or the safety of the men and women of the NYPD,” he
added.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear who will replace Caban as police
commissioner. Inquiries to the police department were not returned.</p>
<p>Caban was one of several high-ranking city officials whose electronic
devices were seized last week by federal investigators, according to
people familiar with the matter. The people spoke on condition of
anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the
investigation.</p>
<p>The subject of the investigation, which is being led by U.S.
Attorney’s office in Manhattan, remains unclear. It was not immediately
clear whether federal authorities were seeking information linked to one
investigation or several.</p>
<p>Federal authorities are also investigating Caban’s twin brother,
James Caban, who runs a nightclub security business, according to a
person familiar with the matter. The person could not publicly discuss
details of the ongoing investigation and spoke to AP on condition of
anonymity.</p>
<p>Edward Caban, 57, had been in charge of the nation’s largest police
department for about 15 months. Of Puerto Rican heritage, he was the
first Latino to lead the 179-year-old NYPD.</p>
<p>Other officials whose devices were recently seized include First
Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright; Philip Banks, the deputy mayor for public
safety; his brother David Banks, the city’s schools chancellor; and
Timothy Pearson, a mayoral adviser and former high-ranking NYPD
official.</p>
<p>The searches added to a flurry of investigative activity around
Adams’ administration and his campaign. Adams, a first-term Democrat,
was subpoenaed in July, eight months after federal agents seized his
cell phones and an iPad while he was leaving an event in Manhattan.
Federal authorities haven’t publicly accused him or any officials of any
crimes, and Adams has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The investigation that led to Caban’s devices being seized is not
believed to be tied to a probe that led federal investigators to seize
Adams’ devices last November, according to two people familiar with the
matter. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not
authorized to speak publicly.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Adams acknowledged that the sudden increase in federal
scrutiny had “raised a lot of questions and a lot of concerns.”</p>
<p>Caban joined the department as a patrol officer in 1991 in the Bronx,
where he grew up. His father, retired Detective Juan Caban, had served
with Adams, a former police captain, when they were both on the city’s
transit police force. Three of Caban’s brothers were also police
officers.</p>
<p>Caban worked in precincts across the city, rising to sergeant,
lieutenant, captain, executive officer, commanding officer, deputy
inspector and inspector. He was the department’s first deputy
commissioner, second-in-command, before being named commissioner last
year.</p>
<p>Caban replaced Keechant Sewell, the first woman to lead the force.
She resigned 18 months into a tenure clouded by speculation that she was
not truly in control of the department after Adams appointed ex-NYPD
chief Philip Banks as his deputy mayor of public safety. She is now the
senior vice president of security and guest experience for the New York
Mets.</p>
<p>From January 1 to September 1, the department tallied 243 murders,
compared with 279 in the same period last year. Burglary, grand larceny
and auto thefts were also down. At the same time, there was a 17.8%
spike in reported hate crimes, 11.1% jump in rapes and smaller increases
in some other categories.</p>
<p>Caban was also criticized for his handling of officer discipline.</p>
<p>In April, he declined to take any internal department disciplinary
action against two involved in the fatal 2019 shooting of a Black man,
Kawaski Trawick, inside his Bronx apartment. Caban said the officers
“acted within the law” and that the city’s police watchdog agency waited
too long to bring administrative charges.</p>
<p>In August, Caban upheld a department administrative trial judge’s
recommendation to drop a disciplinary case against Chief of Department
Jeffrey Maddrey, who was accused of ordering officers to void the
November 2021 arrest of a retired officer who previously worked for him.
The trial judge, Rosemarie Maldonado, said the watchdog agency didn’t
have jurisdiction to investigate the case.</p>

id="six-months-on-key-measures-languish-in-pacific-islands-pact-with-us">Six
months on, key measures languish in Pacific Islands pact with US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — More than six months after a crucial security deal
between Washington and some Pacific Island nations was signed into law,
key features of the Compacts of Free Association have not been
implemented, raising questions in the region about U.S. commitment to
its Pacific partners in the face of an increasingly assertive
Beijing.</p>
<p>In March, the passage of the Compacts of Free Association, or COFA,
extended $7 billion in economic aid over 20 years to three Pacific
Island nations: Micronesia, Palau and the Marshall Islands.
Additionally, COFA says Washington provides for their defense and can
deny China access to their territorial waters, a maritime area larger
than the continental United States.</p>
<p>Since then, however, some parts of the deal have yet to be
implemented, including services and health benefits for veterans who
live on the islands. Currently, veterans must travel to nearby islands
such as Guam or as far away as Hawaii to get the help they need.</p>
<p>“The Biden-Harris administration has failed” to deliver veterans
services to these Pacific Island nations, said Arkansas Republican Bruce
Westerman, who is chair of the U.S. House of Representatives Natural
Resources Committee, during an oversight hearing on COFA this week.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department also has yet to establish a mandatory new
office dedicated to diplomacy with the three islands.</p>
<p>In addition, Washington’s federal programs and services agreement
with Palau has not been renewed, and the current agreement expires on
September 30. Federal services in limbo range from welfare benefits and
food stamp programs to the U.S. Postal Service and veterans’ health
benefits.</p>
<p>“Many of our veterans living in Palau are suffering,” Hersey Kyota,
Palau’s ambassador to the U.S., told the Indian and Insular Affairs
Subcommittee in the oversight hearing, Tuesday. Palau is home to around
20,000 people; with that small population, it has the highest per capita
rate of U.S. military volunteers.</p>
<p>Kyota said at least three Palauan veterans have died by suicide since
January. “They need medication; they need to travel to Guam or Hawaii,
but most of them do not have enough resources to pay for their own
ticket,” he said.</p>
<p>Andrew Harding of the Heritage Foundation said the delays play to
Beijing’s advantage.</p>
<p>“The implementation process is failing,” Harding told VOA. “If we
really want to prove that we are the preferred partner in the Pacific,
especially to our COFA partners, we can’t have these types of questions
be raised.”</p>
<p>Greg Brown, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy
Institute, said, “This doesn’t look good. Now, it’s hurry up and wait,
and who are we waiting for? We’re waiting for ourselves. We’re waiting
for the Americans.”</p>
<p>At the hearing on Tuesday, Anka Lee, deputy assistant secretary of
defense for East Asia, acknowledged the critical need for U.S.
engagement with Palau, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands.</p>
<p>“We know that the PRC is aggressive. They are pushing very hard, and
we have to compete with them toe to toe,” he said to lawmakers, using
the acronym for China’s official name, the People’s Republic of
China.</p>
<p>During the oversight hearing, Taylor Ruggles, the senior COFA adviser
at the U.S. State Department, blamed some of the delay on communication
issues between the White House and Congress and a focus on rolling out
additional embassies in other Pacific Island nations such as Vanuatu. He
said there’s an interagency meeting this week to get all the federal
agencies together to move the process forward. That meeting, the second
this year, is scheduled for Thursday. The first was held in April.</p>
<p>Dr. Miguel H. Lopez, assistant undersecretary for health at the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs, said this week the department would
“provide a comprehensive model of care” to Pacific veterans that is
equal to treatment veterans receive in the continental United
States.</p>
<p>Ambassadors to Palau, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands told
lawmakers at the hearing that they received letters from the Veterans
Administration Monday night, just hours before the oversight
hearing.</p>
<p>“The [veterans] agreement calls for a one-year duration. We’re within
six to seven months now, and we have not heard anything,” said Jack
Soram, the Federated State of Micronesia ambassador to the United
States.</p>
<p>“We don’t have that much time. Veterans need this help,” said
Representative Ed Case, a Democrat from Hawaii.</p>

prison where ‘In Cold Blood’ killers were executed will soon open for
tours</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LANSING, Kansas — The shuttered Kansas prison where the killers
chronicled in Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood were executed is now a
tourist attraction. </p>
<p>Starting Friday, former wardens and corrections officers will lead
two-hour tours of the stone-walled building in Lansing that first began
housing inmates in the 1860s, The Kansas City Star reported. </p>
<p>The building, originally called the Kansas State Penitentiary, was
without purpose after the Kansas Department of Corrections opened the
newly constructed Lansing Correctional Facility in 2020. But instead of
demolishing it, the Department of Corrections transferred control of the
building to the Lansing Historical Society and Museum. </p>
<p>Upcoming events include a car show inside the prison walls later this
month. </p>
<p>“We’re expecting the prison to open up to large crowds who want to
know what went on inside those walls,” Debra Bates-Lamborn, president of
the society, said after state prison officials handed over the keys this
week. </p>
<p>For years, the prison carried out executions by hanging at the
gallows — a site that visitors will not be able to access during tours.
Since removed from prison grounds, the wooden gallows are now
disassembled and under the state’s custody. </p>
<p>Among the notable inmates executed at the prison were Richard “Dick”
Hickock and Perry Smith, who were convicted of murdering four members of
the Clutter family on Nov. 15, 1959, in the family’s home near Holcomb,
Kansas. </p>
<p>Capote, along with his close friend and fellow writer Harper Lee,
visited the prison while doing research for the book about the killings.
Hickock and Smith were executed in April 1965, among the last inmates to
be hanged in the state. </p>
<p>One spot on the tour is the Chow Hall, where the late country music
legend Johnny Cash performed for inmates in 1970. </p>
<p>“Johnny Cash has always said that audiences in prisons are the most
enthusiastic audience he’s ever played to,” Bates-Lamborn said. </p>
<p>The prison tour is modeled off of a similar tour in Missouri. About a
year ago, a state lawmaker approached the Lansing Historical Society and
Museum with the idea of preserving the prison by converting it into a
tourist attraction. </p>
<p>Bates-Lamborn said she and another board member made the trip to
Jefferson City to tour the Missouri State Penitentiary, which has been
open for tours since 2009. </p>
<p>“Afterwards, I thought ours is a shoo-in and we’re so much better,”
she said. </p>
<p>Tours of the facility will be held on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays,
and are scheduled to run until October 26. Since the facility has no
heat or electricity, the tours stop over the winter and will return in
the spring.</p>

<p>
Of all the injustices happening in the world… you know who needs to be
taken down a peg? The Book-a-Week People. Fuck those guys. With their
books in their Zoom backgrounds. That bothers me. Fuck them.
</p>
<p>
I know the original post is part of some weird hustle culture subgenre,
but it’s probably no surprise to folks who reading that I like books and
fit this targeted demographic. After pondering whether I’m “finding
answers to questions or questions to answer” my answer is a resounding,
“…I guess?”
</p>
<p>
A lot of why I read is about juxtaposition. I read business books to
juxtapose my experience against the Platonic ideal of “good business”. I
read about social justice to juxtapose my lived experience against
others lived experience. I read science fiction to juxtapose the present
against futures I haven’t imagined. I read non-fiction airport books
because I like facts and social science garbage. I read books on topics
I’m already an expert in to see if there’s information that further
informs my perspective. I read to
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2018/06/telepresence/">teleport</a> to
different places, minds, times, and rooms where it happened.
</p>
<p>
I read to escape. I read to find myself. I read because I like facts. I
read because I like fiction. I read for entertainment. I read to fall
asleep. I listen to books to help me finish mundane tasks like doing the
dishes every night. And I listen to books because there’s a slight
communistic thrill of getting them from the library.
</p>
<p>
There’s a widely accepted idea out there that “the best way to become a
better writer is to become a better reader.” I think Stephen King said
it, but I can’t find the quote. Either way, I want to become a better
writer. Whether fact or fiction, I want the ability to not struggle when
putting thoughts on the page. Oh to partake in this magical osmosis! The
transitive impartation of skills! Let me flex the language encoding and
decoding synapses in my 40-watt brain.
</p>
<p>
And sometimes reading is out of due diligence. Like… if you’re going to
start a job as a manager… read a book on management? Or ten? You’re
dealing with people’s lives and careers, seems like the least you could
do. If you’re going to talk or blog on a topic and there’s a relevant
book… read that before
<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-southern-phrase-showing-your-ass-mean">showing
your ass</a>? A thought backed by some literature seems better than
regurgitating TikToks.
</p>
<p>
Books are strange objects. Chapters and chapters of coherent research

According to settlement tracking group Peace Now, the Israeli government
has seized more Palestinian land for settlements in the West Bank this
year than at any time in the last three decades. Now, some synagogues in
the U.S. and Canada are being criticized — and picketed — for hosting
real-estate fairs that pitch property for sale in Israel and the
Occupied Territories to North American Jews. We’ll learn more. But
first, we’ll look at why the gender pay gap is widening.

a 34-year-old man suspected of starting a wildfire in California that
has now burned more than 36,000 acres and is less than 20% contained.
The Line fire is one of several large blazes burning in the state and
threatening thousands of structures. Last month another man was charged
with arson on suspicion of igniting the Park fire, which consumed
430,000 acres in Northern California. As Heatmap’s Jeva Lange
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/park-fire-arson?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_fkww6CkDrFW0D91uIi0RMEFOn9mSA6Vn6AXgQumqcqmYeAnarnXQB_v6C52B7G15VoFXs" rel="noopener" target="_self">reported</a>,
arson officially accounts for only about 10% of fires handled by Cal
Fire. But when there are thousands of fires across the state during a
given season, that’s not an inconsequential number. And a warmer world
has made extreme fire conditions more common, as have decades of
misbegotten fire suppression policies in the Western United States. As a
result, arson fires in rural areas are more likely to burn out of
control than they would have been half a century ago, Lange wrote.

to finish the paving of a controversial road through the Amazon
rainforest. The BR-319 highway would connect some major cities and
improve cargo movement, which has been disrupted by record-low water

also hasten deforestation, including in old growth forests. “Without the
forest, there is no water, it’s interconnected,”

section of BR-319, without ensuring environmental governance and the
presence of the government in the region, will lead to historic
deforestation, as pointed out by many specialists and by Brazil’s
federal environmental agency in the licensing process.” Lula made the
pledge during a visit to assess the damage from massive fires in the
rainforest, which his Environment Minister Marina Silva blamed on
extreme drought caused by climate change.

Also, California’s EV drivers <em><em>really</em></em> don’t want to

a 34-year-old man suspected of starting a wildfire in California that
has now burned more than 36,000 acres and is less than 20% contained.
The Line fire is one of several large blazes burning in the state and
threatening thousands of structures. Last month another man was charged
with arson on suspicion of igniting the Park fire, which consumed
430,000 acres in Northern California. As Heatmap’s Jeva Lange

arson officially accounts for only about 10% of fires handled by Cal
Fire. But when there are thousands of fires across the state during a
given season, that’s not an inconsequential number. And a warmer world
has made extreme fire conditions more common, as have decades of
misbegotten fire suppression policies in the Western United States. As a
result, arson fires in rural areas are more likely to burn out of
control than they would have been half a century ago, Lange wrote.

hope cooler weather will aid battle against 3 major Southern California
fires</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Wrightwood, California — Firefighters battling three major wildfires
in the mountains east of Los Angeles took advantage of cooler weather
Wednesday as they slowly gained the upper hand, but not before dozens of
homes were destroyed and thousands of people were forced to
evacuate.</p>
<p>California is only now heading into the teeth of the wildfire season
but already has seen nearly three times as much acreage burn than during
all of 2023. The wildfires have threatened tens of thousands of homes
and other structures across Southern California since they accelerated
during a triple-digit heat wave over the weekend.</p>
<p>No deaths have been reported, but at least a dozen people, mainly
firefighters, have been treated for injuries, mostly heat-related,
authorities said.</p>
<p>In the small community of Wrightwood, about 90 minutes outside Los
Angeles, authorities implored residents to flee the exploding Bridge
Fire, which has burned more than a dozen homes in the area.</p>
<p>Resident Erin Arias said she was racing up the mountain when she got
the order to leave and did, grabbing her passport and dog. On Wednesday,
she and her husband doused water on the roof of their still-standing
home. Their cat was missing, she said.</p>
<p>“It’s absolutely scary,” Arias said, looking at the burned embers of
her neighbor’s home. “We’re really lucky.”</p>
<p>UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain said the fire moved
extraordinarily fast across complex terrain, likely giving residents
less time to evacuate than usual and surprising even seasoned fire
officials.</p>
<p>The Bridge Fire “had to go up mountain sides, burn down slope, jump
across valleys, burn across new ridges, and then make it down slope
again at least two other times in effectively one burning period,” he
said.</p>
<p>The full extent of the damage caused by the fires remained unclear.
The three blazes are:</p>
<p>— The Airport Fire in Orange County, which has burned more than 91
square kilometers. The fire was 5% contained Wednesday night and was
reportedly sparked by heavy equipment operating in the area. Orange
County Fire Capt. Steve Concialdi said eight firefighters have been
treated for injuries, mostly heat-related. One resident suffered smoke
inhalation and another burns, he said. Several homes burned in El Cariso
Village.</p>
<p>— The Line Fire in the San Bernardino National Forest, which was 18%
contained Wednesday and had charred 148 square kilometers. The blaze has
injured three firefighters. Authorities said it was caused by arson in
Highland. A suspect was arrested Tuesday.</p>
<p>— The Bridge Fire east of Los Angeles, which grew tenfold in a day
and has burned 202 square kilometers, torched at least 33 homes and six
cabins and forced the evacuation of 10,000 people. The cause of the fire
is not yet known. It remained zero percent contained Wednesday
night.</p>
<p>Gov. Gavin Newsom sent National Guard troops in to help with
evacuations, and the White House said President Joe Biden was monitoring
the situation.</p>
<p>In El Cariso Village, a community of 250 people along Highway 74 in
Riverside County, an Associated Press photographer saw at least 10 homes
and several cars engulfed in flames.</p>
<p>Orange County Fire Authority Incident Commander Kevin Fetterman said
the blaze has been difficult to tame because of the terrain and dry
conditions and because some areas hadn’t burned in decades.</p>
<p>More than 5,500 homes in Riverside County were under evacuation
orders, affecting more than 19,000 residents. Several recreational
cabins and structures in the Cleveland National Forest have been
damaged.</p>
<p>In San Bernardino County, some 65,600 homes and buildings were under
threat by the Line Fire, and residents along the southern edge of Big
Bear Lake were told to leave Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Line Fire blanketed the area with a thick cloud of dark smoke,
which provided shade for firefighters trying to get ahead of winds
expected later Wednesday, said Fabian Herrera, a spokesperson for those
battling the Line Fire.</p>
<p>A man from the town of Norco suspected of starting the Line Fire on
Sept. 5 was arrested and charged with arson, San Bernardino County
Sheriff’s Department said. Officials did not specify what was used to
start the fire.</p>
<p>Investigators collected evidence from the man’s vehicle and home that
suggests he could have been involved in starting other fires, San
Bernardino County Sheriff Shannon Dicus said Wednesday.</p>
<p>On the Nevada border with California near Reno, the Davis Fire forced
thousands of people to evacuate over the weekend, destroyed one home and
a dozen structures and charred nearly 23 square kilometers of timber and
brush along the Sierra Nevada’s eastern front.</p>
<p>Rich Meyr and Evelyn Kelley were the first arrivals at an evacuation
center set up Wednesday at a recreation center in south Reno. Both said
they refused to evacuate previous fires but decided to play it safe this
time.</p>
<p>“My son’s wedding is Saturday. I threw all the flowers and gowns in
the RV and we left. It looks like a garden shop inside that RV,” Kelley
said. “But who wants to burn alive?”</p>
<p>More than 600 firefighters kept the blaze from growing Wednesday
despite high winds that grounded all aircraft that had dropped retardant
on the flames over the past two days. The fire was about 30% contained
Wednesday night.</p>

id="francine-weakens-moving-inland-from-gulf-coast-after-hurricane-winds-cause-power-outages">Francine
weakens moving inland from Gulf Coast after hurricane winds cause power
outages</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MORGAN CITY, La. — Francine weakened Thursday after striking
Louisiana as a Category 2 hurricane that knocked out power to hundreds
of thousands of homes and businesses, sent storm surge rushing into
coastal communities and raised flood fears in New Orleans and beyond as
drenching rains spread over the northern Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>The tropical storm was forecast to be downgraded to a tropical
depression as it churned northward over Mississippi, the National
Hurricane Center said. Some 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 centimeters) of rain
were possible in parts of Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, Alabama,
Georgia and the Florida Panhandle, with up to 10 inches (25 centimeters)
possible in some spots in parts of Alabama and Florida, forecasters
said, warning of the potential threat of scattered flash flooding as
farflung as Jackson, Mississippi; Birmingham, Alabama; Memphis,
Tennessee; and Atlanta.</p>
<p>Francine slammed the Louisiana coast Wednesday evening with 100 mph
(155 kph) winds in coastal Terrebonne Parish, battering a fragile
coastal region that hasn’t fully recovered from a series of devastating
hurricanes in 2020 and 2021. It then moved at a fast clip toward New
Orleans, pounding the city with torrential rains.</p>
<p>There were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries. TV news
broadcasts from coastal communities showed waves from nearby lakes,
rivers and Gulf waters thrashing sea walls. Water poured into city
streets amid blinding downpours. Oak and cypress trees leaned in the
high winds, and some utility poles swayed back and forth.</p>
<p>“It’s a little bit worse than what I expected to be honest with you,”
said Alvin Cockerham, fire chief of Morgan City about 30 miles (50
kilometers) from where the storm’s center made landfall. “I pulled all
my trucks back to the station. It’s too dangerous to be out there in
this.”</p>
<p>Power outages in Louisiana topped 390,000 early Thursday in
Louisiana, according to the tracking site poweroutage.us, with an
additional 46,000 outages reported in Mississippi.</p>
<p>Sheltering at her mother’s home just outside Morgan City, Laura
Leftwich said blasts of wind had swept away two large birdhouses
outside. She had a generator powering an internet connection so she
could video chat with friends, holding her computer to a window to show
them water overflowing in the street.</p>
<p>If the storm had been any more intense, “I wouldn’t have the guts to
look outside,” said Leftwich, 40. “It’s a little scary.”</p>
<p>The sixth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, Francine drew
fuel from exceedingly warm Gulf of Mexico waters, strengthening to a
Category 2 storm before landfall. It weakened late Wednesday to a
tropical storm.</p>
<p>In addition to torrential rains, there was a lingering threat of
spin-off tornadoes from the storm Thursday in Florida and Alabama.</p>
<p>Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said the National Guard would fan out to
parishes impacted by Francine. They have food, water, nearly 400
high-water vehicles, about 100 boats and 50 helicopters to respond to
the storm, including for possible search-and-rescue operations.</p>
<p>Since the mid-19th century, some 57 hurricanes have tracked over or
made landfall in Louisiana, according to The Weather Channel. Among them
are some of the strongest, costliest and deadliest storms in U.S.
history.</p>
<p>Morgan City, home to around 11,500 people, sits on the banks of the
Atchafalaya River in south Louisiana and is surrounded by lakes and
marsh. It’s described on the city’s website as “gateway to the Gulf of
Mexico for the shrimping and oilfield industries.”</p>
<p>President Joe Biden granted an emergency declaration to help
Louisiana secure expedited federal money and assistance. Landry and
Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves also declared states of emergency.</p>
<p>The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said it distributed more
than 100,000 sandbags to the southern part of the state and the
Department of Education reported a number of school district closures
for Wednesday and Thursday.</p>

The rapid increase in demand for artificial intelligence is creating a
seemingly vexing national dilemma: How can we meet the vast energy
demands of a breakthrough industry without compromising our energy
goals?
</p>
<p>
If that challenge sounds familiar, that’s because it is. The U.S. has a
long history of rising to the electricity demands of innovative new
industries. Our energy needs grew
<a href="https://rhg.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Taking-Stock-2024_US-Energy-and-Emissions-Outlook.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>far
more quickly</u></a> in the four decades following World War II than
what we are facing today. More recently, we have squared off against the
energy requirements of new clean technologies that require significant
energy to produce —

notably hydrogen</a>.

</p>
<p>
The lesson we have learned time and again is that it is possible to
scale technological innovation in a way that also scales energy
innovation. Rather than accepting a zero-sum trade-off between
innovation and our clean energy goals, we should focus on policies that
leverage the growth of AI to scale the growth of clean energy.
</p>
<p>
At the core of this approach is the concept of additionality: Companies
operating massive data centers — often referred to as “hyperscalers” —
as well as utilities should have incentives to bring online new,
additional clean energy to power new computing needs. That way, we
leverage demand in one sector to scale up another. We drive innovation
in key sectors that are critical to our nation’s competitiveness, we
reward market leaders who are already moving in this direction with a
stable, long-term regulatory framework for growth, and we stay on track
to meet our nation’s climate commitments.
</p>
<p>
All of this is possible, but only if we take bold action now.
</p>
<p>
AI technologies have the potential to significantly boost America’s
economic productivity and enhance our national security. AI also has the
potential to accelerate the energy transition itself, from optimizing
the electricity grid, to improving weather forecasting, to accelerating
the discovery of chemicals and material breakthroughs that reduce
reliance on fossil fuels. Powering AI, however, is itself incredibly
energy intensive. Projections suggest that data centers could consume
<a href="https://www.epri.com/about/media-resources/press-release/q5vU86fr8TKxATfX8IHf1U48Vw4r1DZF" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>9%
of U.S. electricity generation</u></a> by 2030, up from 4% today.
Without a national policy response, this surge in energy demand risks
increasing our long-term reliance on fossil fuels. By some estimates,
around
<a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/pages/generational-growth-ai-data-centers-and-the-coming-us-power-surge/report.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>20
gigawatts</u></a> of additional natural gas generating capacity will
come online by 2030, and coal plant retirements are already being
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ddaac44b-e245-4c8a-bf68-c773cc8f4e63" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>delayed</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Avoiding this outcome will require creative focus on additionality.
Hydrogen represents a particularly relevant case study here. It, too, is
energy-intensive to produce — a single kilogram of hydrogen
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360319923018189" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>requires</u></a>
double the average household’s
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&t=3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>electricity</u></a>
consumption. And while hydrogen holds great promise to decarbonize parts
of our economy, hydrogen is not <em><em>per se </em></em>good for our
clean energy goals. Indeed, today’s fossil fuel-driven methods of
<a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/low-emission-fuels/hydrogen" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hydrogen</a>
production generate more emissions than the entire
<a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/transport/aviation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>aviation</u></a>
sector. While we can make zero-emissions hydrogen by using clean
electricity to split hydrogen from water, the source of that electricity
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-treasury" target="_self"><u>matters
a lot</u></a>. Similar to data centers, if the power for hydrogen
production comes from the existing electricity grid, then ramping up
electrolytic production of hydrogen could significantly <em><em>increase
</em></em>emissions by growing overall energy demand without cleaning
the energy mix.
</p>
<p>
This challenge led to the development of an
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>“additionality”
framework</u></a> for hydrogen. The Inflation Reduction Act offers
generous subsidies to hydrogen producers, but to qualify, they must
match their electricity consumption with additional (read: newly built)
clean energy generation close enough to them that they can actually use
it.
</p>
<p>
This approach, which is being refined in proposed guidance from the U.S.
Treasury Department, is designed to make sure that hydrogen’s energy
demand becomes a catalyst for investment in new clean electricity
generation and decarbonization technologies. Industry leaders are
already responding,
<a href="https://hystorenergy.com/hydrogen-industry-support-of-strong-45v-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>stating</u></a>
their readiness to build over 50 gigawatts of clean electrolyzer
projects because of the long term certainty this framework provides.
</p>
<p>
While the scale and technology requirements are different, meeting AI’s
energy needs presents a similar challenge. Powering data centers from
the existing electricity grid mix means that more demand will create
more emissions; even when data centers are drawing on clean electricity,
if that energy is being
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/nuclear/data-centers-want-to-tap-existing-nuclear-power-is-that-good-or-bad" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>diverted</u></a>
from existing sources rather than coming from new,
<em><em>additional</em></em> clean electricity supply, the result is the
same. Amazon’s recent $650 million investment in a data center campus
next to an existing nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania illustrates the
challenge: While diverting those clean electrons from Pennsylvania homes
and businesses to the data center reduces Amazon’s reported emissions,
by increasing demand on the grid without building additional clean
capacity, it creates a need for new capacity in the region that will
likely be met by fossil fuels (while also shifting up to
<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/aep-exelon-pjm-interconnection-amazon-data-center-talen-ferc-isa/719869/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$140
million of additional costs</u></a> per year onto local customers).
</p>
<p>
Neither hyperscalers nor utilities should be expected to resolve this
complex tension on their own. As with hydrogen, it is in our national
interest to find a path forward.
</p>
<p>
What we need, then, is a national solution to make sure that as we
expand our AI capabilities, we bring online new clean energy, as well,
strengthening our competitive position in both industries and
forestalling the economic and ecological consequences of higher
electricity prices and higher carbon emissions.
</p>
<p>
In short, we should adopt a National AI Additionality Framework.
</p>
<p>
Under this framework, for any significant data center project, companies
would need to show how they are securing new, additional clean power
from a zero-emissions generation source. They could do this either by
building new “behind-the-meter” clean energy to power their operations
directly, or by partnering with a utility to pay a specified rate to
secure new grid-connected clean energy coming online.
</p>
<p>
If companies are unwilling or unable to secure dedicated additional
clean energy capacity, they would pay a fee into a clean deployment fund
at the Department of Energy that would go toward high-value investments
to expand clean electricity capacity. These could range from research
and deployment incentives for so-called “clean firm” electricity
generation technologies like nuclear and geothermal, to investments in
transmission capacity in highly congested areas, to expanding
manufacturing capacity for supply-constrained electrical grid equipment
like transformers, to cleaning up rural electric cooperatives that serve
areas attractive to data centers. Given the variance in grid and
transmission issues, the fund would explicitly approach its investment
with a regional lens.
</p>
<p>
Several states operate similar systems: Under Massachusetts’ Renewable
Portfolio Standard, utilities are
<a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/frequently-asked-questions-massdep-clean-energy-standard/download" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>required</u></a>
to provide a certain percentage of electricity they serve from clean
energy facilities or pay an “alternative compliance payment” for every
megawatt-hour they are short of their obligation. Dollars collected from
these payments go toward the development and expansion of clean energy
projects and infrastructure in the state. Facing increasing capacity
constraints on the PJM grid, Pennsylvania legislators are now
<a href="https://www.senatorgeneyaw.com/2024/08/28/yaw-to-unveil-plans-for-pennsylvania-baseload-energy-development-fund/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>exploring</u></a>
a state Baseload Energy Development Fund to provide low-interest grants
and loans for new electricity generation facilities.
</p>
<p>
A national additionality framework should not only challenge the
industry to scale innovation in a way that scales clean technology, it
must also clear pathways to build clean energy at scale. We should
establish a dedicated fast-track approval process to move these clean
energy projects through federal, state, and local permitting and siting
on an accelerated basis. This will help companies already investing in
additional clean energy to move faster and more effectively – and make
it more difficult for anyone to hide behind the excuse that building new
clean energy capacity is too hard or too slow. Likewise, under this
framework, utilities that stand in the way of progress should be held
accountable and incentivized to adopt innovative new technologies and
business models that enable them to move at historic speed.
</p>
<p>
For hyperscalers committed to net-zero goals, this national approach
provides both an opportunity and a level playing field — an opportunity
to deliver on those commitments in a genuine way, and a reliable
long-term framework that will reward their investments to make that
happen. This approach would also build public trust in corporate climate
accountability and diminish the risk that those building data centers in
the U.S. stand accused of greenwashing or shifting the cost of
development onto ratepayers and communities. The policy clarity of an
additionality requirement can also encourage cutting edge artificial
intelligence technology to be built here in the United States. Moreover,
it is a model that can be extended to address other sectors facing
growing energy demand.
</p>
<p>
The good news is that many industry players are already moving in this
direction. A new agreement between Google and a Nevada utility, for
example, would allow Google to pay a higher rate for 24/7 clean
electricity from a new geothermal project. In the Carolinas, Duke Energy
announced its intent to explore a new clean tariff to support
carbon-free energy generation for large customers like Google and
Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
A national framework that builds on this progress is critical, though it
will not be easy; it will require quick Congressional action, executive
leadership, and new models of state and local partnership. But we have a
unique opportunity to build a strange bedfellow coalition to get it done
– across big tech, climate tech, environmentalists, permitting reform
advocates, and those invested in America’s national security and
technology leadership. Together, this framework can turn a vexing
trade-off into an opportunity. We can ensure that the hundreds of
billions of dollars invested in building an industry of the future
actually accelerates the energy transition, all while strengthening the
U.S.’s position in innovating cutting- edge AI and clean energy
technology.

id="botswana-us-firm-partner-to-conduct-border-pathogen-monitoring">Botswana,
US firm partner to conduct border pathogen monitoring</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Gaborone, Botswana — Botswana and an American biotech firm, Ginkgo
Bioworks, have partnered to conduct pathogen surveillance at the
country’s entry points. Health officials say the proactive move is meant
to safeguard public health as the world faces emerging disease
threats.</p>
<p>Botswana introduced mpox screening last month for travelers at its
entry points.</p>
<p>In a statement Wednesday, Ministry of Health spokesperson Christopher
Nyanga said a pathogen-monitoring program is critical to detecting
similar emerging health threats.</p>
<p>Dr. Mbatshi Mazwiduma, a public health expert, said the
pathogen-surveillance program will complement existing strategies to
prevent disease threats.</p>
<p>“The initiative by the Ministry of Health is a very welcome
development in the sense that it is at least demonstrating that they are
both embracing traditional methods of surveillance and disease detection
plus at the same time, they are looking at other innovative ways of
disease detection,” he said.</p>
<p>Through the collaboration, Boston-based Gingko Bioworks will work
with the Ministry of Health to collect and monitor travelers’ samples.
Nasal swabs will be used to collect the samples.</p>
<p>Nyanga said testing will be done on a voluntary, anonymous basis.</p>
<p>“Although participation in this initiative is entirely voluntary,
travelers are encouraged to participate because this early detection of
pathogens is meant to safeguard the health of all citizens, visitors and
residents of this country,” he said. “The samples collected will be kept
anonymous. The data collected from the samples will be vital in
strengthening the country’s robust health system and response to public
health threats and emergencies.”</p>
<p>But Mazwiduma said voluntary participation in the pathogen-monitoring
program could hinder effective disease detection.</p>
<p>“Perhaps if non-invasive, non-intrusive, the technique should be
compulsory because it ensures that the number of people who comply to
sample acquisition is increased and, therefore, you can actually rapidly
achieve suitable sample sizes for you to be able to ensure that you do
not miss any patients, but also more importantly that it allows you to
improve your validation of these particular technologies,” Mazwiduma
said.</p>
<p>Botswana and Gingko Bioworks previously collaborated in a 2022
pathogen-monitoring program to detect new and emerging COVID-19
variants.</p>
<p>During the same year, Botswana was credited with the discovery of
COVID-19 variant omicron.</p>

countering Chinese influence in the region.</p>
<p>Thomas-Greenfield told Reuters she hopes the announcement will “move
this agenda forward in a way that we can achieve Security Council reform
at some point in the future,” describing it as part of U.S. President
Joe Biden’s legacy.</p>
<p>The push for two permanent African seats and a rotating seat for
small island developing states is in addition to Washington’s long-held
support for India, Japan and Germany to also get permanent seats on the
council.</p>
<p>Developing nations have long demanded permanent seats on the Security
Council, the most powerful body in the United Nations. But years of
talks on reform have proved fruitless and it is unclear whether U.S.
support could fuel action.</p>
<p>Ahead of making the announcement at the Council on Foreign Relations
in New York on Thursday, Thomas-Greenfield clarified to Reuters that
Washington does not support expanding veto power beyond the five
countries that hold it.</p>
<p>The Security Council is charged with maintaining international peace
and security and has the power to impose sanctions and arms embargos and
authorize the use of force.</p>
<p>When the U.N. was founded in 1945, the Security Council had 11
members. This increased in 1965 to 15 members, made up of 10 elected
states serving two-year terms and five permanent veto-wielding nations:
Russia, China, France, the U.S. and Britain.</p>
<p>Legitimacy problem</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres backs Security Council
reform.</p>
<p>“You have a Security Council that corresponds exactly to the
situation after the Second World War … that has a problem of legitimacy,
and that has a problem of effectiveness, and it needs to be reformed,”
Guterres told Reuters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Any change to the Security Council membership is done by amending the
founding U.N. Charter. This needs the approval and ratification by
two-thirds of the General Assembly, including the Security Council’s
current five veto powers.</p>
<p>The 193-member U.N. General Assembly has annually discussed reform of
the Security Council for more than a decade. But momentum has grown in
recent years as geopolitical rivalries have deadlocked the council on
several issues, particularly after permanent veto-wielding member Russia
invaded Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Much of the conversation around Security Council reform has been
just that: a conversation,” Thomas-Greenfield will say on Thursday,
according to prepared remarks reviewed by Reuters of her announcement
that Washington supports moving to negotiations on a draft text to amend
the U.N. Charter to expand the council.</p>
<p>Thomas-Greenfield told Reuters she could not say how long it might
take to get the General Assembly to vote on such a resolution.</p>
<p>Each year the General Assembly elects five new members from different
geographical groups for two-year terms on the Security Council. Africa
currently has three seats rotated among states.</p>
<p>“The problem is, these non-permanent seats don’t enable African
countries to deliver the full benefit of their knowledge and voices to
the work of the council … to consistently lead on the challenges that
affect all of us - and disproportionately affect Africans,”
Thomas-Greenfield will say.</p>
<p>She will also say that small island developing states deserve a
rotating elected seat because they offer “critical insights on a range
of international peace and security issues: including, notably, the
impact of climate change.”</p>

id="us-grants-egypt-1.3-billion-in-military-aid-overriding-rights-conditions">US
grants Egypt $1.3 billion in military aid, overriding rights
conditions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The Biden administration is overriding human rights
conditions on military aid to Egypt, a State Department spokesperson
said on Wednesday, granting the U.S. ally its full allocation of $1.3
billion this year for the first time during this administration, despite
ongoing concerns over human rights in the country.</p>
<p>The announcement comes as Washington has relied heavily on Cairo, a
longstanding U.S. ally, to mediate so far unsuccessful talks between
Israel and Hamas on a cease-fire deal to end the war in Gaza.</p>
<p>Of the $1.3 billion in U.S. foreign military financing allocated to
Egypt, $320 million is subject to conditions that have meant at least
some of that sum has been withheld in recent years.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Congress on Wednesday that he
would waive a certification requirement on $225 million related to
Egypt’s human rights record this year, citing “the U.S. national
security interest,” the spokesperson said by email.</p>
<p>“This decision is important to advancing regional peace and Egypt’s
specific and ongoing contributions to U.S. national security priorities,
particularly to finalize a cease-fire agreement for Gaza, bring the
hostages home, surge humanitarian assistance for Palestinians in need,
and help bring an enduring end to the Israel-Hamas conflict,” the
spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Democrat Chris Murphy, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee’s Middle East subcommittee, said Washington had previously
withheld military aid from Egypt on human rights grounds while
maintaining its strategic relationship with the country.</p>
<p>“It’s no secret that Egypt remains a deeply repressive autocratic
state, and I see no good reason to ignore that fact by waiving these
requirements,” Murphy said.</p>
<p>Cairo has remained a close regional ally of Washington despite
accusations of widespread abuses under President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi’s
government, including torture and enforced disappearances.</p>
<p>Sissi denies there are political prisoners in Egypt. He says
stability and security are paramount and authorities are promoting
rights by trying to provide basic needs such as jobs and housing.</p>
<p>The war in Gaza, sparked by the October 7 attacks by Palestinian
militants on southern Israel, has increased Washington’s reliance on
Cairo for diplomatic efforts like the cease-fire talks. Much-needed
humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza also enters from Egypt.</p>
<p>Blinken issued a similar waiver on the human rights conditions last
year but withheld a portion of the military aid over Egypt’s failure to
make “clear and consistent progress” on the release of political
prisoners.</p>
<p>This year, he determined that Egypt had made sufficient efforts on
political prisoners to release $95 million tied to progress on the
issue, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>They cited Egypt’s efforts to draft legislation to reform pretrial
detention and the broader penal code, its release of some political
prisoners and a move to end travel bans and asset freezes associated
with foreign funding for nongovernmental organizations.</p>
<p>Seth Binder, director of advocacy for the Washington-based Middle
East Democracy Center, said that while about 970 prisoners had been
released since last September, at least 2,278 Egyptians were arbitrarily
arrested over the same period, according to data collected by the center
and Egyptian human rights groups.</p>
<p>The State Department spokesperson said Washington was continuing “a
rigorous dialogue with the Egyptian government on the importance of
concrete human rights improvements that are crucial to sustaining the
strongest possible U.S.-Egypt partnership.”</p>

case faces uncertainty again as US appellate court arguments loom</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The future of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals
(DACA) program remains in limbo with another court hearing set for
October 10.</p>
<p>Judges from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear arguments
on the case, initiated in 2018 by Texas and other Republican-led states
seeking to end DACA. The program offers temporary protection from
deportation and work permits to undocumented immigrants brought to the
U.S. as children who are often referred to as “Dreamers.”</p>
<p>The case centers on whether DACA exceeds presidential authority,
immigration advocates from the coalition “Home is Here” said during a
recent conversation with reporters.</p>
<p>“Our response to that is that presidential authority in the area of
immigration, and particularly the discretion exercised by the executive
branch, is very broad and certainly encompasses the type of program that
DACA is, which is now a regulation,” Nina Perales, vice president of
litigation at the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund,
said during the call.</p>
<p>A central issue in the case is whether Texas and other states have
the standing to sue.</p>
<p>Texas and other Republican-led states have argued that DACA has
harmed them financially because they are spending resources on
education, health care and other services on undocumented immigrants who
were allowed to remain in the country illegally.</p>
<p>But Perales, who will be one of the attorneys arguing the case in
October, said that “Texas cannot show any injury as a result of DACA”
because recipients contribute to their communities and states by paying
taxes and more.</p>
<p>A final decision could take a while, said Perales, who noted the 5th
Circuit could take “as long as 18 months” to rule.</p>
<p>And the case could end in several ways: The 5th Circuit might dismiss
the case, send it back to the lower court or rule against DACA, which
could then be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>“One possible scenario is that the 5th Circuit decides [U.S.
District] Judge [Andrew] Hanen didn’t evaluate the evidence properly and
sends the case back to [him],” she said.</p>
<p>If that happens, Perales said, DACA recipients might benefit from the
current case’s legal state, which allows recipients to continue renewing
their DACA benefits while awaiting the courts’ final resolution. The
Biden administration continues to accept new applications but does not
process them.</p>
<p>How we got here</p>
<p>Former President Barack Obama, frustrated with congressional inaction
on the Dream Act, created DACA by executive order in 2012. Some DACA
recipients arrived legally, but their families later overstayed their
visas; others arrived by crossing the U.S.-Mexico border without
authorization. They are now in their mid-20s to late 30s, and they come
from around the world.</p>
<p>In 2018, Texas and other Republican-led states sued the federal
government, arguing not only that they were being harmed financially but
also that only Congress has the authority to grant immigration
benefits.</p>
<p>In 2022, the Biden administration revised the program in hopes of
satisfying one of the arguments made in federal courts by Republican-led
states — that the program was not created properly. Biden officials
issued the new version of DACA in late August. It went through a period
of public comments as part of a formal rule-making process to increase
its odds of surviving this legal battle.</p>
<p>In a February 2023 statement, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a
Republican, wrote in a statement on his website that “the Obama and
Biden programs are practically indistinguishable in both the negative
harms that they will have on this country and in the illegal means used
to implement them. I am therefore calling for the new DACA rule to end
in the same way that the Obama-era rule did: struck down as
unlawful.”</p>
<p>But DACA has support. In October 2022, a coalition of dozens of
influential corporations, including Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft,
sent a letter to Republicans and Democrats in Congress urging a
bipartisan solution for the almost 600,000 immigrants who are enrolled
in DACA.</p>
<p>According to the Migration Policy Institute, DACA has “improved
recipients’ employment outcomes, increased the labor force participation
rates of those who are eligible, decreased their unemployment rates, and
boosted earnings for those with the lowest incomes.”</p>
<p>MPI’s analysis shows that DACA holders contribute “nearly $42 billion
to the U.S. gross domestic product each year and add $3.4 billion to the
federal balance sheet.”</p>
<p>Bruna Bouhid-Sollod, a former DACA recipient and current senior
political director at United We Dream, highlighted the emotional impact
of the uncertainty.</p>
<p>“The importance of making [the impact] really clear is really
important. … DACA recipients and their families are dealing with an
extreme amount of stress,” she said.</p>
<p>With renewal periods lasting just two years, many recipients are in
constant limbo, unsure if their work permits and deportation protections
will remain intact.</p>
<p>There is a lot at stake, according to immigration lawyers and
advocates.</p>
<p>“Unless you’re living in it … you don’t think about the impact it has
on the people that are waiting for their lives to be decided by this
case,” Bouhid-Sollod said.</p>

id="trump-falsely-accuses-immigrants-in-ohio-of-abducting-eating-pets">Trump
falsely accuses immigrants in Ohio of abducting, eating pets</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio — Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday amplified
false rumors that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were abducting and eating
pets, repeating during a televised debate the type of inflammatory and
anti-immigrant rhetoric he has promoted throughout his campaigns.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that Haitian immigrants in an Ohio community are
doing that, officials say. But during the debate with Vice President
Kamala Harris, Trump specifically mentioned Springfield, Ohio, the town
at the center of the claims, saying that immigrants were taking over the
city.</p>
<p>“They’re eating the dogs. They’re eating the cats. They’re eating the
pets of the people that live there,” he said.</p>
<p>Harris called Trump “extreme” and laughed after his comment. Debate
moderators pointed out that city officials have said the claims are not
true.</p>
<p>Trump’s comments echoed claims made by his campaign, including his
running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, and other Republicans. The claims
attracted attention this week when Vance posted on social media that his
office has “received many inquiries” about Haitian migrants abducting
pets. Vance acknowledged Tuesday it was possible “all of these rumors
will turn out to be false.”</p>
<p>Officials have said there have been no credible or detailed reports
about the claims, even as Trump and his allies use them to amplify
racist stereotypes about Black and brown immigrants.</p>
<p>While president, Trump questioned why the U.S. would accept people
from “s—hole” countries such as Haiti and some in Africa. His 2024
campaign has focused heavily on illegal immigration, often referencing
in his speeches crimes committed by migrants. He argues immigrants are
responsible for driving up crime and drug abuse in the United States and
taking resources from American citizens.</p>
<p>Here’s a closer look at how the false claims have spread.</p>
<p>How did this get started?</p>
<p>On September 6, a post surfaced on X that shared what looked like a
screengrab of a social media post apparently out of Springfield. The
retweeted post talked about the person’s “neighbor’s daughter’s friend”
seeing a cat hanging from a tree to be butchered and eaten, claiming
without evidence that Haitians lived at the house. The accompanying
photo showed a Black man carrying what appeared to be a Canada goose by
its feet. That post continued to be shared on social media.</p>
<p>On Monday, Vance posted on X: “Reports now show that people have had
their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn’t be in this
country. Where is our border czar?” he said. The next day, Vance posted
again on X about Springfield, saying his office had received inquiries
from residents who said “their neighbors’ pets or local wildlife were
abducted by Haitian migrants. It’s possible, of course, that all of
these rumors will turn out to be false.”</p>
<p>Other Republicans shared similar posts. Among them was Texas Senator
Ted Cruz, who posted a photo of kittens with a caption that said to vote
for Trump “So Haitian immigrants don’t eat us.”</p>
<p>Hours before Trump’s debate with Harris, he posted two related photos
on his social media site. One Truth Social post was a photo of Trump
surrounded by cats and geese. Another featured armed cats wearing MAGA
hats.</p>
<p>A billboard campaign launched by the Republican Party of Arizona at
12 sites in metropolitan Phoenix plays off the false rumors. The
billboard image resembles a Chick-fil-A ad, portraying four kittens and
urging people to “Vote Republican!” and “Eat Less Kittens.”</p>
<p>Chick-fil-A said the party didn’t reach out to the restaurant chain
before running the ad, declining to comment further. In a statement, the
state party said the ad humorously underscores the need for border
security.</p>
<p>What do officials in Ohio say?</p>
<p>The office of the Springfield city manager, Bryan Heck, issued a
statement knocking down the rumors.</p>
<p>“In response to recent rumors alleging criminal activity by the
immigrant population in our city, we wish to clarify that there have
been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed,
injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community,” Heck’s
office said in an emailed statement.</p>
<p>Springfield police on Monday told the Springfield News-Sun that they
had received no reports of stolen or eaten pets.</p>
<p>Governor Mike DeWine held a news conference Tuesday to address the
influx of Haitian immigrants to Springfield. He said he will send state
troopers to Springfield to help local law enforcement deal with traffic
issues and is earmarking $2.5 million over two years to provide more
primary health care to immigrant families.</p>
<p>DeWine declined to address the allegations, deferring comment to
local officials. But he repeatedly spoke in support of the people of
Haiti, where his family has long operated a charity.</p>
<p>What do we know about a separate case 281 km away?</p>
<p>An entirely unrelated incident that occurred last month in Canton,
Ohio, quickly and erroneously conflated into the discussion.</p>
<p>On Aug. 26, Canton police charged a 27-year-old woman with animal
cruelty and disorderly conduct after she “did torture, kill, and eat a
cat in a residential area in front (of) multiple people,” according to a
police report.</p>
<p>But Allexis Ferrell is not Haitian. She was born in Ohio and
graduated from Canton’s McKinley High School in 2015, according to
public records and newspaper reports. Court records show she has been in
and out of trouble with the law since at least 2017. Messages seeking
comment were not returned by several attorneys who have represented
her.</p>
<p>She is being held in Stark County jail pending a competency hearing
next month, according to the prosecutor’s office.</p>
<p>What do advocates for Haitian immigrants say?</p>
<p>The posts create a false narrative and could be dangerous for
Haitians in the United States, according to Guerline Jozef, founder and
executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, a group that supports
and advocates for immigrants of African descent</p>
<p>“We are always at the receiving end of all kind of barbaric, inhumane
narratives and treatments, specifically when it comes to immigration,”
Jozef said in a phone interview.</p>
<p>Her comments echoed White House national security spokesman John
Kirby.</p>
<p>“There will be people that believe it, no matter how ludicrous and
stupid it is,” Kirby said. “And they might act on that kind of
information, and act on it in a way where somebody could get hurt. So it
needs to stop.”</p>
<p>What is the broader context of Haitians in Ohio and the United
States?</p>
<p>Springfield, a city of roughly 60,000, has seen its Haitian
population grow in recent years. It’s impossible to give an exact
number, according to the city, but it estimates Springfield’s entire
county has an overall immigrant population of 15,000.</p>
<p>The city also says that the Haitian immigrants are in the country
legally under a federal program that allows for them to remain in the
country temporarily. Last month the Biden administration granted
eligibility for temporary legal status to about 300,000 Haitians already
in the United States because conditions in Haiti are considered unsafe
for them to return. Haiti’s government has extended a state of emergency
to the entire country due to endemic gang violence.</p>
