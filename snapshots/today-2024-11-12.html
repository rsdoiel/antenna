In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01681">“Language Models as Agent
Models”</a>, compelling evidence suggests that recent language models
could be considered models of <em>agents</em>: provided with a textual
context, LLMs are capable of generating conditional text that represents
the characteristics of an agent likely to have produced that context.
This suggests that, with appropriate conditioning, LLMs could be guided
to approximate the responses of a particular human voice, rather than
the <em>mixture of voices</em> that otherwise emerges. If realized, this
capability of LLMs would have significant implications for user research
and social sciences—conditioned language models as <strong>virtual
personas</strong> of human subjects could serve as cost-effective pilot
studies and supporting best practices in human studies, e.g. the Belmont
principles of justice and beneficence.
</p>
<p>
In this work, we introduce <strong>Anthology</strong>, an approach for
steering LLMs to representative, consistent, and diverse virtual
personas by providing richly detailed life narratives of individuals as
conditioning context to models. <!--more--> In doing so, we also present
methods to generate backstories from LLMs themselves as a means to
efficiently produce massive sets covering a wide range of human
demographics. By grounding language models in naturalistic backstories,
Anthology allows LLMs to simulate individual human samples with
increased fidelity, measured in terms of matching the distributions and
consistencies of human responses.

Conditioning Language Model Generation with Individual Life Narratives
</h3>
<p>
A significant limitation of earlier methods in steering LLMs to virtual
personas has been the inability to reliably approximate
<strong>individual</strong> human samples.
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17548">Prior</a>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06899">approaches</a> prompt LLMs
with broad demographic information, e.g., “I am a 25-year-old from
California. My highest level of education is less than high school,”
which are essentially bodies of text generated from a tuple of
demographic variables. With these methods, we are only able to
approximate human samples at a <em>population level</em>, not at the
individual level, which results in:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Responses prone to LLMs defaulting to stereotypical and/or prototypical
portrayals, as they are only conditioned on demographic variables (e.g.,
race and gender)
</li>
<li>
Inability to provide important metrics of interest such as covariance
and statistical significance, as individual responses are required for
such compuatations
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Anthology enables the approximation of individual subjects by
conditioning with richly detailed backstories. Through these
backstories, the model captures implicit and explicit markers of
personal identity, including demographic traits and spontaneous
references to cultural, socioeconomic backgrounds, and life
philosophies. Our approach involves generating a vast set of backstories
representing a wide range of demographic attributes via language models
queried with unrestricted, open-ended prompts such as, “Tell me about
yourself.” We then match virtual personas conditioned by each backstory
to real-world survey samples.
</p>
<h3 id="results-closer-approximation-of-public-opinion-polls">
Results: Closer Approximation of Public Opinion Polls
</h3>
<p>
For evaluation, we compare the effectiveness of different methods for
conditioning virtual personas in the context of approximating three Pew
Research Center ATP surveys: Waves 34, 92, and 99.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/virtual_personas/results.jpg" width="100%" />
<br /> <i>Results on approximating human responses for Pew Research
Center ATP surveys. Boldface and underlined results indicate values
closest and the second closest to those of humans, respectively.</i>
</p>
<p>
As measures of success in approximating human samples with virtual
personas, we consider the following metrics:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Average Wasserstein distance (WD) between response distributions as a
measure of representativeness
</li>
<li>
Frobenius norm (Fro.) between correlation matrices as a measure of
consistency
</li>
<li>
Cronbach’s alpha as an additional measure of internal consistency
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Prior to analyzing virtual subjects, we estimate the lower bounds of
each evaluation metric by repeatedly dividing the human population into
two equal-sized groups at random and calculating these metrics between
the subgroups. We take averaged values from 100 iterations to represent
the lower-bound estimates.
</p>
<p>
We consistently observe that <em>Anthology</em> outperforms other
conditioning methods with respect to all metrics, for both the
Llama-3-70B and the Mixtral-8x22B. When comparing two matching methods,
the greedy matching method tends to show better performance on the
average Wasserstein distance across all Waves. We attribute differences
in matching methods to the one-to-one correspondence condition of
maximum weight matching and the limited number of virtual users
available. Specifically, the weights assigned to matched virtual
subjects in maximum weight matching are inevitably lower than those in
greedy matching, as the latter relaxes the constraints on one-to-one
correspondence. This discrepancy can result in a lower demographic
similarity between matched human and virtual users compared to the
counterpart from greedy matching. These results suggest that the
richness of the generated backstories in our approach elicits more
nuanced responses compared to baselines.
</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">
Final Thoughts
</h2>
<p>
Anthology marks a promising new direction in conditioning virtual
personas in LLMs that could potentially reshape how we conduct user
research, public opinion surveys, and other social science applications
by offering a scalable, and at times, ethical alternative to traditional
human surveys. However, the use of Anthology, as in any other
application of language models in the social sciences, also brings
several considerations to the forefront: although the generated
backstories help create more representative personas, there remains a
risk of perpetuating biases or infringing on privacy, so results should
be used and interpreted with caution.
</p>
<p>
In terms of future steps, we envision our approach benefiting from a
more expansive and diverse set of backstories, each representing a
consistent life narrative of individuals. Additionally, a valuable
extension of the work would be to consider free-form response
generation, enabling more natural and nuanced persona simulations beyond
structured survey formats such as multiple-choice. Finally, an exciting
next dimension in applying LLMs in behavioral studies would involve
simulating longer-term effects, allowing virtual personas to model and
retrospectively examine changes over time.
</p>
<p>
All of these directions present multitudes of technical challenges;
please let us know if you are interested in collaborating or want to
discuss our work further!

Palestine</h2>

YouTube Version | Podcast Version Content Warning: This isn’t the sort
of piece that’s going to dwell on gory details, but there’s no way to
talk about the Israeli/Palestinian conflict and the history of the
Jewish people without discussing some pretty horrific things, including
genocide, mass murder, rape, torture, and suicide, as well as racism,

Mysterious Machines</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-11, from: Advent of Computing</p>
<p>
In 1933 Konrad Zuse, a German civil engineer, caught the computing bug.
It would consume the rest of his life. According Zuse he invented the
world’s first digital computer during WWII, working in near total
isolation within the Third Reich. How true is this claim? Today we are
looking at Zuse’s early machines, the Z1, Z2, and Z3.
