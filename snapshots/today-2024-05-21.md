## Scarlett Johansson says she is ‘shocked, angered’ over new ChatGPT voice

date: 2024-05-21, from: OS News

Lawyers for Scarlett Johansson are demanding that OpenAI disclose how it developed an AI personal assistant voice that the actress says sounds uncannily similar to her own. Johansson&#8217;s legal team has sent OpenAI two letters asking the company to detail the process by which it developed a voice the tech company dubbed &#8220;Sky,&#8221; Johansson&#8217;s publicist told NPR in a revelation that has not been previously reported. ↫ Bobby Allyn at NPR This story highlights just how much disdain techbros have for the work of creative people. Here&#8217;s the timeline: Techbros like Sam Altman deeply despise and undervalue the work of creatives, believing human creativity to be merely an equation to be solved, definable by an algorithm. To people like him, creative work has no value, and as such, is up for grabs to be taken and cut up for his algorithms to spit out as &#8220;new&#8221; works. This story highlights this perfectly. The sleaze runs deep with Altman and OpenAI.

## In Houston, storm damage recovery and insurance hurdles

date: 2024-05-21, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Houston residents are once again rebuilding after a severe windstorm delivered damage to cars, businesses and homes last week. Insurers are just beginning to assess the extent of the damage — at a time when insurance is getting pricier and harder to find. Then, the FDIC&#8217;s chair says he will step down once a successor is confirmed following investigations into toxic culture at the agency. Plus, can legislation save local news?</p>

Shareholders will vote at the company’s annual meeting on June 13 on whether to re-ratify Musk’s 2018 pay package, which a judge voided in January. The letter also says shareholders should not vote to re-elect board members Kimbal Musk (Elon’s brother) and James Murdoch (Elon’s friend), suggesting they are too closely tied to the CEO.

<span></span>Here’s an interesting little statistic for you: In 2023, light-duty electric vehicles consumed more electricity than the nation’s railways, <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/MX06PXLmKQRW8-tFFt3dDZYSW5XFwz15flBtRN9h9bHK3qn9gW7lCdLW6lZ3nDN75n1cGzF9xjW7ylZhl2GWtdKW7T7rnY3vgWcYW4w4Hbn5xqdkSW2lmDMv30SGT2W6ZbBKN57xWJdW5vQy8s7wHKHRN29BFHl521-ZW48wFnR8r2KBGW8X9-1Z1wpTF8W7x-MkH6jZzqqN7TKK9YyR62jW1PB4W_1v221RW338BMc8w3JKXW5DXKPw1G5DhjW2K8mYY7dBKbXW6Xd89h7sVZ1WW65cFTL7Zyyr2W1TVz542yZYD9W6pNNLW4WbTWWW1zKSdt8PkSjGW85w8vy63jF7RW1lTPPk163Lb_W4GBxxQ3jXzcSf1_c9Nz04" target="_blank">according to</a> the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Annual railway electricity usage has hovered around 7,000 Gigawatt hours (GWh) since 2003, making it the largest electricity end-use category in the transportation sector. But that changed last year when EVs took the top spot, using 7,596 GWh. The EIA notes this is nearly five times the amount of electricity EVs consumed in 2018. The numbers underscore two trends: the limited expansion of U.S. rail, and the explosive growth of EV sales.

<p>From the BBC World Service: Artificial intelligence has been argued to be the tech of our time, and lawmakers have been grappling with how to regulate it.

## US expects South Korea and Japan to manage ties with China at summit amid growing differences

date: 2024-05-21, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Ahead of a trilateral summit involving South Korea, Japan, and China this weekend in Seoul, Washington said it expects the event to be an opportunity for its two allies to manage their relations with Beijing.


“The United States respects the ability of nations to make sovereign decisions in the best interests of their people,” said a spokesperson for the State Department.


“Just as the United States takes steps to responsibly manage our relationship with the PRC, so do our partners and allies,” the spokesperson continued in an email to VOA’s Korean Service on May 15. The People’s Republic of China (PRC) is China’s official name.




The summit would come amid a heightened tension between Washington and Beijing over trade  and after China agreed with Russia to establish a “new era” partnership to create “a multipolar world order” during their summit last week.


The three East Asian countries are expected to hold their summit from May 26 to 27, but the official dates have not been announced. Chinese Premier Li Qiang is expected to attend in place of Chinese President Xi Jinping to meet with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.


The meeting would be their first trilateral summit since December 2019.


Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA on May 14 that Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul should be main drivers responsible for regional stability and security.


Pointing out what Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said after a trilateral foreign ministers meeting in November, Pengyu said the three countries need to “address differences and disputes in peaceful ways” and “act as front runner of East Asia cooperation.”


Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing are planning to discuss trade and investment, peace and security, and science and technology, among other items and include in a joint statement their cooperation on economic issues and infectious diseases, according to the Japan Times, citing Japanese government sources Sunday.


Former U.S. officials said while it will be important for the three countries to meet and talk at the summit, differences that Seoul and Tokyo have with Beijing on North Korea are unlikely to be resolved.


“With China determined to establish a new China-centric regional order and because of Beijing’s open-ended support for the DPRK, we should not expect progress on this issue,” said Evans Revere, a State Department official with extensive experience negotiating with North Korea.


North Korea’s official name is the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).


“Nevertheless, it is important for South Korea and Japan to use this summit to convey their strong concerns,” Revere continued.


At a bilateral summit last week, Beijing and Moscow criticized Washington and its allies for their “intimidation in the military sphere” against North Korea.




 


Zhao Leji, who ranks third in the Chinese Communist Party, visited Pyongyang in April and agreed with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to boost cooperation on mutual concerns. It was the highest-level talks the two countries had held in years.


The upcoming summit comes after trilateral cooperation was agreed among Washington, Seoul and Tokyo at their Camp David summit in August 2023 to strengthen their deterrence against North Korean threats and to defend a free and open Indo-Pacific against Chinese aggressions.


Joseph DeTrani, who served as the U.S. special envoy for six-party denuclearization talks with North Korea from 2003 to 2006, said, “China will ask that the ROK and Japan not to align with the U.S. against China, an issue that wasn’t on the table in 2019.”


South Korea’s official name is the Republic of Korea (ROK).


DeTrani said Seoul and Tokyo will “try to get China to convince North Korea to cease providing arms to Russia for its war in Ukraine” and “to use its leverage” with Pyongyang “to halt ballistic missile launches.”




Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of Kim Jong Un, denied Pyongyang’s arms dealings with Moscow, according to state-run KCNA on Friday. The same day, North Korea launched a tactical ballistic missile, said KCNA. 


Gary Samore, who served as the White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration, said the summit will become “an opportunity for communication” among Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing to avoid conflict, but the differences that grew among them since 2019 will not be resolved as South Korea and Japan “leaned in the direction of cooperating with the U.S.”

There is a curious dynamic at work in politics these days. Trump does not appear to be trying to court voters to his standard. If he were, he would be reaching out to Nikki Haley voters and trying to moderate his stances. Instead, he is rejecting her voters and doubling down on extreme positions. Rather than trying to appeal to swing voters, he seems to be trying to whip up his right-wing base to engage in violence on his behalf.

## Why the Biden White House chose Kenya for its first state visit by an African leader

date: 2024-05-21, from: VOA News USA

The White House — The White House says it chose Kenya for its first state visit by an African leader for many reasons — not least because the East African powerhouse has stepped up on the global stage, offering to staff a United Nations peacekeeping mission to Haiti that could see boots on the ground as early as this week.


VOA White House correspondent Anita Powell sat down with Frances Brown, the newly appointed director for African affairs at the National Security Council, ahead of a state visit by Kenyan President William Ruto. They discussed a range of issues, including technology, climate management, debt relief, democracy, health and more.


The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.


VOA: In a few days, President Joe Biden hosts Kenyan President William Ruto at the White House, his first African leader for a state visit. Why was Kenya chosen and what deliverables can we expect?


Frances Brown, NSC director for African affairs: We chose Kenya for a few reasons. No. 1 is the Kenya-U.S. partnership has really grown from a regionally focused one to a globally focused one. ... and we see a lot of complementarities in terms of what we're trying to do on climate. What we're trying to do on debt for the developing world, and on security issues.




The second reason we wanted to have this state visit with Kenya is that we are both democracies, and our bond is very deep as democracies, and our bond is very deep on people-to-people ties.


The third reason is that Kenya and the U.S. really work similarly in terms of bringing in the private sector to solve global challenges. So, we'll be talking a lot about those. The deliverables you'll see are in the realms of technology, clean energy and climate transition, of debt relief, of democracy, of people-to-people ties and on health-related issues.


VOA: Kenya hopes to soon have peacekeepers in Haiti. Why is this so important to the administration?


Brown: We do really welcome the Kenyans raising their hand to help lead this multinational security support mission in Haiti, because it's kind of an example of what I just mentioned of Kenya raising its hand to solve problems even outside of its region. ... As you may know, there's been planning under way for a number of months. It has included policing experts from around the world working to develop a concept of operations. Kenya is not going it alone. The U.S. has provided $300 million towards this, so it's a big thing for us.


VOA: Are there any other security agreements these two countries might come up with during the state visit?


Brown: I would say watch this space, because I think security cooperation with Kenya is a really important plank.


VOA: Is it going to be focused on threats from Somalia or from other parts of East Africa?


Brown: The U.S. and Kenya have long cooperated on Somalia. I think you can look for security-related announcements that go beyond that.


VOA: U.S. troops are pulling out of the Sahel and the so-called “Coup Belt.” What are the concerns the administration has about security in the Sahel region, especially as Russia expands its footprint there?


Brown: As has been widely reported, we are making an orderly withdrawal from Niger. I will say that is pretty consistent with our administration’s [counterterrorism] posture in general that we have made changes to our posture that are consistent with our CT policy. It is no secret that democracy is on the backfoot in a lot of places globally.


If you talk to democracy scholars, democracy is on something like its 20th year of global decline. So, Africa is not alone in this regard. The Biden administration is focused on lifting up and partnering with democracies to help them deliver.


You may have seen USAID’s initiative on democracy delivering. We're working with a few African countries on that. And I think this is, again, something that we'll be talking a lot to the Kenyans with, because President Ruto has talked about the imperative of democracy delivering.


VOA: Regarding issues of trade and the African Growth and Opportunity Act — obviously, this is going to be a decision made by Congress, but how does the administration feel about the benefits of trade and of barrier-free trade with the United States?


Brown: President Biden has been really vocal that he sees AGOA reauthorization and AGOA modernization as a huge priority. It has been huge, I think from our perspective, but also from the perspective of the region. It's something we hear a lot about from our Kenyan partners. We do look to Congress for that. But as you know, reauthorization is due next year, and obviously we hope that things can get in motion before then.


VOA: The President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief — which has been a literal lifesaver for people around the African continent — is up for renewal next year. How does the White House see this program as contributing to national security?


Brown: We see PEPFAR as essential. And as you know, PEPFAR has been supported with bipartisan congressional support and across administrations since the George W. Bush initiative initially. We think PEPFAR is delivering for people across the continent, and we've been proud to support it, and we look for reauthorization.


VOA: When is President Biden going to visit Africa, and where will he go?


Brown: So, I cannot make news at this moment by announcing presidential travel. But what I will say is thus far, I think President Biden's commitment to the relationship with the continent is pretty clear. If you think about Kenya, it's the first state visit that we're giving to a non-G20 country this term. There's only been five other state visits. ... But then you just look at the steady stream of Cabinet official travels to the continent over the past two years — by our count, there's 24 principals or Cabinet-level officials who've made that trip, all of them bringing their own agenda.


I'd also say just in terms of the other ways President Biden has shown his commitment, advocating for AU [African Union] membership with the G20 has been huge. Advocating for more African seats and international financial institutions and all the other transformative investment.


VOA: You’ve just joined the NSC in this capacity. What priorities do you bring to this post?


Brown: I think I see this post as moving forward on the affirmative agenda that President Biden laid out first, and the Sub-Saharan Africa Strategy, which was published at the end of 2021. Then the African Leaders Summit, which came at the end of 2022. There were a lot of initiatives launched by those two events. Now we are running forward on implementation.


At the same time, of course, at the NSC, the urgent sometimes competes with the important, so of course, we're seized with managing crises. And we're really sobered by the crises that are happening in many parts of the continent. So, I see my role as a balance between those two, and I'm thrilled to be on board.

EPA did not say how many cyber incidents have occurred in recent years, and the number of attacks known to be successful so far is few. The agency has issued nearly 100 enforcement actions since 2020 regarding risk assessments and emergency response, but said that's a small snapshot of the threats water systems face.

## Head of US deposit insurance agency to step down

date: 2024-05-21, from: VOA News USA

new york — The White House said Monday that the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation would step down, a departure that will follow the release this month of a damning report about the agency’s toxic workplace culture.


The White House said Martin Gruenberg would step down once a successor was appointed and that President Joe Biden would name a replacement “soon." The announcement came after the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee earlier Monday called for Gruenberg's removal.


Biden expects the FDIC "to reflect the values of decency and integrity and to protect the rights and dignity of all employees,” deputy press secretary Sam Michel said in a statement.


The FDIC is one of several U.S. banking system regulators. The Great Depression-era agency is best known for running the nation’s deposit insurance program, which insures Americans’ deposits up to $250,000 in case their banks fail.


Before Monday, no Democrats had called for Gruenberg’s ouster, although several came very close to doing so. But Senator Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Banking Committee, who is facing a tough reelection campaign, issued a statement Monday calling for Gruenberg to step down, saying his leadership at the FDIC could no longer be trusted.


Gruenberg was grilled for two days last week on Capitol Hill in hearings largely focused on the FDIC's workplace culture and the failures disclosed in the report prepared by an outside law firm.


"After chairing last week’s hearing, reviewing the independent report and receiving further outreach from FDIC employees ... , I am left with one conclusion: There must be fundamental changes at the FDIC,” Brown said in a statement.


Republicans have been calling for Gruenberg's ouster for some time and criticized the White House for not calling for his immediate departure.


Gruenberg has held various leadership positions at the FDIC for nearly 20 years, and this was his second full term as FDIC chair. His long tenure at the agency made him largely responsible for the agency's toxic work environment, according to the report outlining the problems at the agency.


The report released last Tuesday by law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton cites incidents of stalking, harassment, homophobia and other violations of employment regulations, based on more than 500 complaints from employees.


Among the complaints: a woman said she was stalked by a coworker and continually harassed even after complaining about his behavior; a field office supervisor referred to gay men as “little girls”; and a female field examiner  described receiving a picture of an FDIC senior examiner’s private parts.

## Xeon Phi support removed in GCC 15 compiler

date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News

Last week I wrote about Intel aiming to remove Xeon Phi support in GCC 15 with the products being end-of-life and deprecated in GCC 14. While some openly wondered whether the open-source community would allow it given the Xeon Phi accelerators were available to buy just a few years ago and at some very low prices going back years so some potentially finding use still out of them especially during this AI boom (and still readily available to buy used for around ~$50 USD), today the Intel Xeon Phi support was indeed removed. ↫ Michael Larabel Xeon Phi PCIe cards are incredibly cheap on eBay, and every now and then my mouse hovers over the buy button &#8211; but I always realise just in time that the cards have become quite difficult to use, since support for them, already sparse to begin with, is only getting worse by the day. Support for them was already removed in Linux 5.10, and now GCC is pulling he plug too, so the only option is to keep using old kernels, or pass the card on to a VM running an older Linux kernel version, which is a lot of headache for what is essentially a weird toy for nerds at this point. GCC 15 will also, sadly, remove support for Itanium, which, as I&#8217;ve said before, is a huge disgrace and a grave mistake. Itanium is the future, and will stomp all over crappy architectures like x86 and ARM. With this deprecation, GCC relegates itself to the dustbin of history.

## Modernizing the AntennaPod code structure

date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News

AntennaPod has been around for a long time &#8211; the first bit of code was published in 2011. Since then, the app has grown massively and had several main developers. The beauty of open-source is that so many people can contribute and make a great app together. But sometimes having many people work on a project can lead to different ways of thinking about how to structure the project. Because of this, AntennaPod gradually grew to have a number of weird code constructs. Our latest release, version 3.4, fixes this. ↫ ByteHamster The AntennaPod team had an incredible task ahead of itself, and while it took them a few years, they pulled it off. The code structure graphs from before and after the code restructuring illustrate better than words ever could what they achieved. Thy changed 10000 lines of source code in 62 pull requests for this restructuring alone, while still adding new major features in the meantime. Pretty incredible.

## Microsoft gives Windows new compiler, kernel, scheduler, and x86 translation layer on ARM

date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News

Microsoft&#8217;s developer conference Build is taking place this week, so there&#8217;s been some major Windows news and announcements, and for once &#8211; we&#8217;re not talking about more ads in your operating system, or even &#8220;AI&#8221; shoehorned into, I don&#8217;t know, Phone Dialer or Windows Fax and Scan. First and foremost, Windows is going to get a new compiler, kernel, and scheduler, but despite such massive low-level changes, the marketing version number won&#8217;t jump from 11 to 12. Of course, we all know the marketing version number has nothing to do with the actual Windows NT version number, which currently sits at 10. The Windows NT version number, meanwhile, is actually also meaningless, since it magically jumps around left and right too, going from 6.2 to 10 between Windows 8.1 and Windows 10, where it has stayed ever since. &#8220;We really focused on modernizing this update of Windows 11,&#8221; said Microsoft Corporate Vice President of Windows and Devices Pavan Davuluri at a technical briefing on Microsoft&#8217;s campus in mid-April. &#8220;We engineered this update of Windows 11 with a real focus on AI inference and taking advantage of the Arm64 instruction set at every layer of the operating system stack. For us, what this meant really was building a new compiler in Windows. We built a new kernel in Windows on top of that compiler. We now have new schedulers in the operating system that take advantage of these new SoC architecture.&#8221; ↫ Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica The focus is clearly on ARM here, which coincides with the launch of Qualcomm&#8217;s Snapdragon X Elite, a new SoC that finally seems to truly make ARM laptops that aren&#8217;t from Apple a real, competitive thing &#8211; so much so that Qualcomm is even breaking with tradition and taking Linux support very seriously for this new chip. Microsoft also unveiled the name for its new x86 translation layer for Windows on ARM: Prism. Microsoft told Ars Technica that Prism is as fast as Apple&#8217;s Rosetta 2, which is interesting because Apple&#8217;s M series chips contain special silicon to speed up the translation process, making me wonder if Qualcomm has done the same, or is just brute-forcing it. Performance like this means the apps customers love work great. Microsoft has partnered closely with developers across the globe to optimize their applications for this processor. In addition, the powerful new Prism emulation engine delivers a 2x performance boost compared to Surface Pro 9 with 5G. On the new Surface Pro and Surface Laptop, powered by Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus processors, experiences like Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft 365 and Chrome will feel snappy, quick and responsive. ↫ Pete Kyriacou on the Windows blog The new Windows on ARM machines using the Snapdragon X Elite will be marketed under the new Copilot+ brand name, which brings with it some requirements, the biggest of which is the neural processing unit: it must be capable of at least 40 trillion operations per second. At the time of writing, the only Windows-capable processor that can boast such numbers is, of course, the new Snapdragon X Elite. AMD and Intel need not apply. They simply cannot match this. Microsoft tied a bow on all this stuff by unveiling the new Surface Pro and new Surface Laptop, both powered by the new Snapdragon SoCs. You can preorder them today, but they won&#8217;t be available until 18 June.

## US agency warns of increasing cyberattacks on water systems

date: 2024-05-20, from: VOA News USA

washington — Cyberattacks against U.S. water utilities are becoming more frequent and more severe, the Environmental Protection Agency warned Monday as it issued an enforcement alert urging water systems to take immediate protective action. 


About 70% of utilities inspected by federal officials over the last year violated standards meant to prevent breaches or other intrusions, the agency said. Officials urged even small water systems to improve protections against hacks. Recent cyberattacks by groups affiliated with Russia and Iran have targeted smaller communities. 


Some water systems are falling short in basic ways, the alert said, including failure to change default passwords or cut off system access to former employees. Because water utilities often rely on computer software to operate treatment plants and distribution systems, protecting information technology and process controls is crucial, the EPA said.


Possible impacts of cyberattacks include interruptions to water treatment and storage; damage to pumps and valves; and alteration of chemical levels to hazardous amounts, the agency said. 


"In many cases, systems are not doing what they are supposed to be doing, which is to have completed a risk assessment of their vulnerabilities that includes cybersecurity and to make sure that plan is available and informing the way they do business," said EPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe. 


Attempts by private groups or individuals to get into a water provider's network and take down or deface websites aren't new. More recently, however, attackers have targeted utilities' operations. 


Geopolitical rivals


Recent attacks are not just by private entities. Some recent hacks of water utilities are linked to geopolitical rivals and could lead to the disruption of the supply of safe water to homes and businesses. 


McCabe named China, Russia and Iran as the countries that are "actively seeking the capability to disable U.S. critical infrastructure, including water and wastewater." 


Late last year, an Iranian-linked group called "Cyber Av3ngers" targeted multiple organizations including a small Pennsylvania town's water provider, forcing it to switch from a remote pump to manual operations. They were going after an Israeli-made device used by the utility in the wake of Israel's war against Hamas. 


Earlier this year, a Russian-linked "hacktivist" tried to disrupt operations at several Texas utilities. 


A cyber group linked to China and known as Volt Typhoon has compromised information technology of multiple critical infrastructure systems, including drinking water, in the United States and its territories, U.S. officials said. Cybersecurity experts believe the China-aligned group is positioning itself for potential cyberattacks in the event of armed conflict or rising geopolitical tensions. 


"By working behind the scenes with these hacktivist groups, now these [nation states] have plausible deniability and they can let these groups carry out destructive attacks. And that to me is a game changer," said Dawn Cappelli, a cybersecurity expert with the risk management firm Dragos Inc. 


The world's cyberpowers are believed to have been infiltrating rivals' critical infrastructure for years, planting malware that could be triggered to disrupt basic services. 


The enforcement alert is meant to emphasize the seriousness of cyberthreats and inform utilities the EPA will continue its inspections and pursue civil or criminal penalties if they find serious problems. 


"We want to make sure that we get the word out to people that, 'Hey, we are finding a lot of problems here,' " McCabe said. 


 




Broader federal effort


Preventing attacks against water providers is part of the Biden administration's broader effort to combat threats against critical infrastructure. In February, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to protect U.S. ports. Health care systems have been attacked. The White House has pushed electric utilities to increase their defenses, too. EPA Administrator Michael Regan and White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan have asked states to come up with a plan to combat cyberattacks on drinking water systems. 


"Drinking water and wastewater systems are an attractive target for cyberattacks because they are a lifeline critical infrastructure sector but often lack the resources and technical capacity to adopt rigorous cybersecurity practices,'' Regan and Sullivan wrote in a March 18 letter to all 50 U.S. governors. 


Some of the fixes are straightforward, McCabe said. Water providers, for example, shouldn't use default passwords. They need to develop a risk assessment plan that addresses cybersecurity and set up backup systems. The EPA says it will train water utilities that need help for free. Larger utilities usually have more resources and the expertise to defend against attacks. 


"In an ideal world ... we would like everybody to have a baseline level of cybersecurity and be able to confirm that they have that," said Alan Roberson, executive director of the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators. "But that's a long ways away." 


Some barriers are foundational. The water sector is highly fragmented. There are roughly 50,000 community water providers, most of which serve small towns. Modest staffing and anemic budgets in many places make it hard enough to maintain the basics — providing clean water and keeping up with the latest regulations. 


"Certainly, cybersecurity is part of that, but that's never been their primary expertise. So, now you're asking a water utility to develop this whole new sort of department" to handle cyberthreats, said Amy Hardberger, a water expert at Texas Tech University. 


States, industry groups object


The EPA has faced setbacks. States periodically review the performance of water providers. In March 2023, the EPA instructed states to add cybersecurity evaluations to those reviews. If they found problems, the state was supposed to force improvements. 


But Missouri, Arkansas and Iowa, joined by the American Water Works Association and another water industry group, challenged the instructions in court on the ground that EPA didn't have the authority under the Safe Drinking Water Act. After a court setback, the EPA withdrew its requirements but urged states to take voluntary actions anyway. 


The Safe Drinking Water Act requires certain water providers to develop plans for some threats and certify they've done so. But its power is limited. 


"There's just no authority for [cybersecurity] in the law," said Roberson. 


Kevin Morley, manager of federal relations with the American Water Works Association, said some water utilities have components that are connected to the internet — a common but significant vulnerability. Overhauling those systems can be a significant and costly job. And without substantial federal funding, water systems struggle to find resources. 


The industry group has published guidance for utilities and advocates for establishing a new organization of cybersecurity and water experts that would develop new policies and enforce them, in partnership with the EPA. 


"Let's bring everybody along in a reasonable manner," Morley said, adding that small and large utilities have different needs and resources.

## US 2024 election: What to expect in Kentucky's primaries

date: 2024-05-20, from: VOA News USA

washington — All of Donald Trump's top opponents for the Republican nomination for president dropped out of the race weeks ago, but the whole gang will be back together on Kentucky's primary ballot Tuesday.


Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie all suspended their campaigns after Kentucky finalized its ballot in January, as did pastor Ryan Binkley.


Trump has easily won nearly every Republican contest so far, but Haley has won a significant number of votes in several recent primaries, including Maryland (20%) and Nebraska (18%) this week.


President Joe Biden's opponents in Kentucky are author Marianne Williamson and U.S. Representative Dean Phillips. Democrats can also vote for “uncommitted,” which has attracted protest votes in other states.




Kentucky voters will also decide six primaries for the U.S. House. One race to watch is the 4th Congressional District Republican primary. Representative Thomas Massie, who backed DeSantis’ presidential bid and co-sponsored a motion to remove House Speaker Mike Johnson, is facing a challenge from Eric Deters, a staunch Trump supporter. However, Deters hadn’t reported raising any money as of the latest filing deadline and placed fourth in the 2023 gubernatorial primary.


Here’s a look at what to expect on Tuesday. 


Primary day


Kentucky will hold presidential primaries and will also choose nominees for the U.S. House, the state legislature and the state Senate. Polls will close locally at 6 p.m. across the state. However, Kentucky is nearly cut in half by time zones; most of it falls in the Eastern time zone, while 41 counties in the western part of the state are on Central time.  


Who gets to vote 


Kentucky has a closed primary system, which means that only voters registered with a political party may participate in that party’s primary. Democrats may not vote in the Republican primary or vice versa. Independent or unaffiliated voters may not participate in either primary.


Delegate allocation rules


Kentucky Republicans allocate their 46 delegates proportionally to any candidate who receives more than 15% of the vote, meaning any of Trump's opponents could qualify for delegates. They could also splinter the anti-Trump vote, increasing Trump’s chances of being the only candidate to receive 15% of the vote and therefore the only candidate to receive any delegates. 


Kentucky’s 53 pledged Democratic delegates are allocated according to the national party’s standard rules. Twelve at-large delegates are allocated in proportion to the statewide vote, as are six PLEO delegates, or “party leaders and elected officials.” The state’s six congressional districts have a combined 35 delegates at stake, which are allocated in proportion to the vote results in each district. Candidates must receive at least 15% of the statewide vote to qualify for any statewide delegates, and 15% of the vote in a congressional district to qualify for delegates in that district. 


Decision notes 


While Republican state parties that hold primaries this late in the cycle tend to embrace a winner-takes-all system for delegate allocation, Kentucky Republicans are dividing their delegates proportionally among candidates who receive at least 15% of the vote. 


For signs that a candidate not named Trump could reach that 15% threshold, look to suburban areas like Louisville and Lexington. Those areas — Jefferson and Fayette counties — are also the biggest sources of GOP votes in the state. 


In the 2020 presidential primary, “uncommitted” and Trump were the only two options on the Republican ballot. Statewide, “uncommitted” received 13% of the vote in the GOP primary. In Jefferson County, however, “uncommitted” received 23%. 


In the 4th Congressional District — which runs along the Ohio River, sharing its northern boundary with Indiana and Ohio — the United Democracy Project, a group that has criticized Massie for his record on Israel, had spent $328,672 on the race as of last Tuesday. However, those ads have not supported an alternative candidate. 


The AP does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why. 


Kentucky mandates a recount if the top candidate wins by less than 0.5 percentage point. However, that recount rule does not apply to the presidential race. Candidates can ask for a recanvass of the vote, which entails retabulating the vote totals, if the margin is less than 1 percentage point. However, to request a recount, in which each ballot is hand-counted, a court must approve and prescribe the procedure. 


What do turnout and the advance vote look like? 


As of March 31, there were 3,487,292 registered voters in Kentucky. Of those voters, 43% were Democrats and 46% were Republicans.  


In 2022, 17% of voters cast their ballots before Election Day.  


How long does vote-counting usually take?


In the 2023 primary election, the AP first reported results at 6:03 p.m. Eastern time, or three minutes after the first polls closed. The election night tabulation ended at 9:56 p.m. with about 98% of total votes counted. 


Are we there yet?


As of Tuesday, there will be 168 days until the November general election.

## Gasoline Prices Could Be Pretty Low This Summer — Except for One Thing

date: 2024-05-20, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjI4NDMzMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0OTI3ODcxOH0.xEX5_EfLRpQJKgaWYpIYPnhUeoTL1YmJIyS-Zgj2TIw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">The American oil refining business is a <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pnp_cap1_dcu_nus_a.htm" target="_blank">national colossus</a>, with almost 130 facilities taking in some <a href="https://ir.eia.gov/wpsr/wpsrsummary.pdf" target="_blank">16 million barrels of crude oil</a> per day and turning it into nearly <a href="https://ir.eia.gov/wpsr/wpsrsummary.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">10 million barrels of gasoline and 5 million barrels of diesel</a>. And unlike some past years, inventories are looking pretty good heading into this summer. While they’re lower than the five-year average, gasoline supplies are still higher than where they were a year ago, and refineries are a ways away from running at their peak capacity. According to the forecasters at GasBuddy, we’re looking at relatively mild summertime prices of around $3.50 to $3.60 per gallon.</p><p>The one wild card: weather. About half of America’s refining capacity <a href="https://www.eia.gov/special/gulf_of_mexico/" target="_blank">sits on the Gulf Coast</a>, putting America’s fuel production squarely in the target zone of what could be an <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-season-2024" target="_blank">especially active hurricane season</a>. </p><p>“If you recall 2022, inventories were tight and [refinery] utilization was tight,” explained Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy’s head of petroleum analysis. Gas prices peaked in June of 2022 at slightly over $5 per gallon, according to data the Energy Information Administration’s data, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine sent crude oil prices soaring to more $120 a barrel. “Our head is holding above water now,” he said, because demand is low. “We’re in a much better position going into the start of the summer compared to two years ago.”</p><p>Oil prices have largely stayed steady so far this year other than a brief <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DCOILWTICO" target="_blank">spike</a> in early April, despite continued attacks on <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/9/yemens-houthis-say-they-attacked-ships-in-gulf-of-aden-indian-ocean" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shipping by Houthi rebels in Yemen</a> and the ongoing threat of a spiraling regional conflict in the Middle East. The top gas price last month was around $3.67 a gallon, whereas GasBuddy’s range of possible prices for the summer months average closer to $3.60. All things considered, De Haan told me, “we got a little bit of breathing room.”</p><p>Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note to clients last week that gasoline stockpiles “remain close to the 5-year average level and are not drawing as strongly as usual for this time of year,” which puts downward pressure on prices. U.S. demand is hovering below 9 million barrels these days, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=23&t=10" target="_blank">which is right about the average demand in 2023</a>, indicating that some consumer weakness may be responsible for relatively mild gas prices.</p><p>Weaker-than-expected demand for gasoline would be consistent with other signs of the American consumer being slightly less spendy in recent months. <a href="https://www.census.gov/retail/sales.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Overall retail sales in April</a> were basically flat from the month before, according to Census Bureau data, and came in <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/us-retail-sales-stall-in-april-missing-expectations-6-new-bankruptcies-81691705" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lower than economists’ expectations</a>. Sales at gasoline stations were down 0.8% in the first four months of this year compared to the first four months of 2023, despite overall spending going up 3.5% from the same period a year ago.</p><p>What can be good for drivers may not be so great for investors and the gasoline complex at large. “It’s undeniable to say that there’s some trouble in gasoline land,” Rory Johnston, a commodities analyst and author of Commodity Context, told me. “In terms of whether it’s supply or demand more broadly, as always, it’s a bit of both.”</p><p>Whatever the cause, it will mean <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-refiners-profits-fall-last-year-margins-remain-strong-2024-04-24/" target="_blank">less profit for refiners</a>, especially compared to the record outperformance they’ve seen in recent years. </p><p>“Gasoline prices and refining margins have come under pressure,” Reuters reported last week, meaning that refineries are making a bit less than before on the difference between crude oil and gasoline prices. Inventories are also being run down more slowly than is normal for the pre-summer season, the report said, “indicating supplies are plentiful, and undermining the bullish case for the fuel.”</p><p>And yet if it’s destructive enough, just one hurricane could upend that entire narrative. When Hurricane Harvey parked its torrential rains over Houston in 2017, it took a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/30/harvey-shuts-down-largest-us-oil-refinery-bears-down-on-louisiana-plants.html#:~:text=Tropical%20Storm%20Harvey%20has%20shuttered,area%20refiners%20were%20also%20closed." target="_blank">big chunk of the U.S. refinery complex offline</a>, pushing gas prices up $0.36 in just two weeks.<br/></p><p>While the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has yet to release its official hurricane forecast for the year, The Weather Company has <a href="https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2024-04-17-weather-company-hurricane-season-outlook-april" target="_blank">predicted</a> that the 2024 season “could be one of the most active on record.” If those hurricanes hit the wrong parts of the Gulf Coast, the expected mild summer for America’s internal combustion-dependent drivers may be blown away.</p>

## 'The Apprentice,' about a young Donald Trump, premieres in Cannes

date: 2024-05-20, from: VOA News USA

CANNES, France — While Donald Trump's hush money trial entered its sixth week in New York, an origin story for the Republican presidential candidate premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on Monday, unveiling a scathing portrait of the former president in the 1980s. 


"The Apprentice," directed by the Iranian Danish filmmaker Ali Abbasi, stars Sebastian Stan as Trump. The central relationship of the movie is between Trump and Roy Cohn (Jeremy Strong), the defense attorney who was chief counsel to Joseph McCarthy's 1950s Senate investigations. 


Cohn is depicted as a longtime mentor to Trump, coaching him in the ruthlessness of New York City politics and business. Early on, Cohn aided the Trump Organization when it was being sued by the federal government for racial discrimination in housing. 


"The Apprentice," which is labeled as inspired by true events, portrays Trump's dealings with Cohn as a Faustian bargain that guided his rise as a businessman and, later, as a politician. Stan's Trump is initially a more naive real-estate striver, soon transformed by Cohn's education. 


The film notably contains a scene depicting Trump raping his wife, Ivana Trump (played by Maria Bakalova). In Ivana Trump's 1990 divorce deposition, she stated that Trump raped her. Trump denied the allegation and Ivana Trump later said she didn't mean it literally, but rather that she had felt violated. 


That scene and others make "The Apprentice" a potentially explosive big-screen drama in the midst of the U.S. presidential election. The film is for sale in Cannes, so it doesn't yet have a release date. 


Variety on Monday reported alleged behind-the-scenes drama surrounding "The Apprentice." Citing anonymous sources, the trade publication reported that billionaire Dan Snyder, the former owner of the Washington Commanders and an investor in "The Apprentice," has pressured the filmmakers to edit the film over its portrayal of Trump. Snyder previously donated to Trump's presidential campaign. 


Neither representatives for the film nor Snyder could immediately be reached for comment. 


In the press notes for the film, Abbasi, whose previous film "Holy Spider" depicts a female journalist investigating a serial killer in Iran, said he didn't set out to make "a History Channel episode." 


"This is not a biopic of Donald Trump," said Abbasi. "We're not interested in every detail of his life going from A to Z. We're interested in telling a very specific story through his relationship with Roy and Roy's relationship with him." 


Regardless of its political impact, "The Apprentice" is likely to be much discussed as a potential awards contender. The film, shot in a gritty 1980’s aesthetic, returns Strong to a New York landscape of money and power a year following the conclusion of HBO's "Succession." Strong, who's currently performing on Broadway in "An Enemy of the People," didn't attend the Cannes premiere Monday. 


"The Apprentice" is playing in competition in Cannes, making it eligible for the festival's top award, the Palme d'Or. At Cannes, filmmakers and casts hold press conferences the day after a movie's premiere. "The Apprentice" press conference will be Tuesday.

## As clicks dry up for news sites, could Apple News be a lifeline?

date: 2024-05-20, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog

    <div class="known-bookmark">
                <div class="e-content">

<p>"The free version of Apple News is one of the biggest news platforms in the world. It’s the most widely used news application in the United States, the U.K., Canada, and Australia, and boasted over 125 million monthly users in 2020." </p>

<p>And publications are becoming dependent on it.</p>

<p>I agree strongly with the journalist's view at the bottom of this piece:</p>

<p>"It incentivizes users to subscribe to Apple News+ rather than to publications directly, likely cannibalizing some potential revenue. It’s driving editorial decisions, meaning publishers are once again changing their content strategy to placate a platform. And of course the company could wake up one day and decide, like Facebook, that it no longer really wants to be in the news business, leaving news publishers stranded."</p>

<p>Newsrooms - say it with me - need to establish direct, first-party connections with their audiences. Anything else gives a third party too much supplier power over their businesses and presents an existential risk. Apple News is useful right now, but at its heart the dynamics that drive it are no different to Facebook or Twitter. There's nothing to say it's here for good, and there's nothing smart about letting Apple own your relationship with your readers.  <a href="https://werd.io/tag/Media" class="p-category" rel="tag">#Media</a></p>

## The IndieWeb’s next stage?

date: 2024-05-20, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog

    <div class="known-bookmark">
                <div class="e-content">

<p>"I want the IndieWeb to be a viable alternative to social media, gradually widening the audience beyond tech-savvy folks by making the tools easier to use and more reliable." </p>

<p>This is what we were trying for with Known: something that felt social but was fully under the user's control. We had installers at third-party hosts; we had our own managed service; we had the open source code for people who wanted to use that directly.</p>

<p>The fediverse adds a missing piece here: Known suffered immensely from a blank page and no reader view when you logged in for the first time. Now we can build platforms that immediately connect people to a much wider social network that is outside of monolithic corporate control but also makes it (relatively) easy to find the people you care about.</p>

<p>A combination between the fediverse and indieweb is almost inevitable. This is what Ghost appears to be building today, for example, with its new integrated fediverse reader tool. WordPress may also be headed in that direction. And there will be many others.</p>

<p>A huge +1, also, to the idea that we can "manifest momentum by speaking aloud your dreams and letting others share them with you". This is how community-building works.</p>

<p>And, for the record, I'm all-in.  <a href="https://werd.io/tag/Technology" class="p-category" rel="tag">#Technology</a></p>

## Supreme Court rejects appeal from Canadian man once held at Guantanamo

date: 2024-05-20, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected an appeal by a Canadian-born former Guantanamo detainee who was seeking to wipe away his war crimes convictions, including for killing a U.S. soldier in Afghanistan.


Omar Khadr had waived his right to appeal when he pleaded guilty in 2010 to charges that included murder. But his lawyers argued that a subsequent ruling by the federal appeals court in Washington called into question whether Khadr could have been charged with the crimes in the first place.


A divided three-judge panel ruled that, despite the appellate ruling, Khadr gave up his right to appeal.




Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Ketanji Brown Jackson did not take part in the Supreme Court's consideration of Khadr's appeal because both had dealt with the case while they served as appeals court judges. Jackson explained her recusal from Monday's order; Kavanaugh did not.


Khadr had been sentenced to eight years in prison plus the time he already had spent in custody, including several years at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. But he was released in May 2015 pending his appeal of the guilty plea.


A Canadian judge ruled in 2019 that his war crimes sentence had expired.


Khadr was 15 when he was captured by U.S. troops following a firefight at a suspected al-Qaida compound in Afghanistan that resulted in the death of an American special forces medic, U.S. Army Sgt. First Class Christopher Speer. Khadr, who was suspected of throwing the grenade that killed Speer, was taken to Guantanamo and ultimately charged with war crimes by a military commission.

## Ship that caused deadly Baltimore bridge collapse has been refloated, moving back to port

date: 2024-05-20, from: VOA News USA

Baltimore — The container ship that caused the deadly collapse of Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge was refloated at high tide Monday and began slowly moving back to port, guided by several tugboats.


Removing the Dali from the wreckage marked a significant step in ongoing cleanup and recovery efforts. Nearly two months have passed since the ship lost power and crashed into one of the bridge’s supporting columns, killing six construction workers and halting most maritime traffic through Baltimore’s busy port.


The vessel appeared to start moving shortly after 6 a.m. It started and stopped a few times before slowly and steadily backing away from the collapse site, where it had been grounded since the March 26 disaster.


Pieces of the bridge’s steel trusses still protruded from its damaged bow, which remained covered in mangled concrete from the collapsed roadway.




With the hulking cargo ship finally removed from the mouth of Baltimore’s harbor, a newly opened void appeared in the city’s skyline. The altered waterscape also highlighted the progress made on the cleanup effort; crews have already removed hundreds of tons of mangled steel that once were visible jutting up from the water’s surface.


The bodies of all six construction workers have been recovered from the underwater wreckage in recent weeks. All the victims were Latino immigrants who came to the U.S. for job opportunities. They were filling potholes on an overnight shift when the bridge was destroyed.


Officials said the Dali would move at about 1 mph on the roughly 2.5-mile (4-kilometer) trip back to port, a fraction of the speed it was traveling when it lost power and brought down the bridge.


The ship is expected to remain in the port for a several weeks and undergo temporary repairs before being moved to a shipyard for more substantial repairs. It will return to the same marine terminal it occupied before beginning its ill-fated voyage.


Crews began preparing the ship to be refloated about 18 hours before it started moving Monday morning. That process included releasing anchors and pumping out over 1 million gallons of water that were keeping the ship grounded and stable during complex cleanup operations. Crews conducted a controlled demolition on May 13 to break down the largest remaining span of the collapsed bridge, which was draped across the Dali’s bow.


Dive teams also completed inspections of the site to confirm there were no obstructions that would hinder the voyage.


The Dali experienced two electrical blackouts about 10 hours before leaving the Port of Baltimore on its way to Sri Lanka, according to a preliminary report released last week by the National Transportation Safety Board. In response to those issues, the crew made changes to the ship’s electrical configuration, switching to a transformer and breaker system that had previously been out of use for several months, the report says.


The Dali experienced two more blackouts as it was approaching the Key Bridge, causing it to lose propulsion and drift off course at the exact wrong moment.


The two tugboats that helped guide the Dali out of the port had peeled off after it entered the main shipping channel. That was normal protocol, according to the report, but when the power went out, the tugs were too far away to help avert disaster.


The FBI has also launched a criminal investigation into the circumstances leading up to the crash.


The ship’s crew members haven’t been allowed to leave the vessel since the disaster. Officials said they’ve been busy maintaining the ship and assisting investigators. Of the crew members, 20 are from India and one is Sri Lankan. Officials have said they will be able to disembark once the Dali is docked in Baltimore.


Officials plan to reopen the port’s 50-foot (15-meter) deep draft channel by the end of May. Until then, crews have established a temporary channel that’s slightly shallower.

## Ruto on first state visit by Kenyan leader to US in two decades

date: 2024-05-20, from: VOA News USA

Nairobi — Kenyan President William Ruto meets his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden in Washington this week, with the crisis in Haiti and efforts to build trade ties likely to top the agenda.


Billed as "historic" by Ruto's office, it is the first state visit by a Kenyan president to the United States in two decades and the first by an African leader since 2008.


Thursday's Biden-Ruto talks will focus on trade and security partnerships including Kenya's pledge to lead a UN-backed multinational mission seeking to restore order in Haiti, which has been wracked by gang-fueled anarchy.




Kenya has offered to send 1,000 personnel, along with forces pledged by several other countries, although the United States and other major nations have ruled out putting their own forces on the ground.


A first batch of Kenyan police is expected to make the 12,000-kilometre (7,500-mile) journey to the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince this week, security sources told AFP, despite a fresh court challenge in Nairobi against the deployment.


Ruto has defended the undertaking as a "mission for humanity" in the Western hemisphere's poorest nation, which has suffered from poverty, political instability and natural disasters for decades.


But a new lawsuit filed last week is seeking to hold Ruto's government in contempt for "blatantly" ignoring a January court order prohibiting the deployment as unconstitutional and illegal.


Funding could also prove a stumbling block for the mission, analysts say.


The United States is the largest backer of the force, pledging more than $300 million since the Haiti crisis intensified several years ago but other countries have been slow to offer support.


Ruto will demand "the U.S. do more to rally financial support for the UN basket fund," said Meron Elias, East and Southern Africa analyst at the International Crisis Group.


"Kenya also wants the U.S. to commit greater backing to stemming the flow of arms into Haiti, including from US ports in Florida," she said.


Trade deal


Ruto begins his visit on Monday in Atlanta, Georgia where he will visit the Carter Presidential Library and Museum, among other engagements.


"His remarks here will underline the importance of democracies working collaboratively to tackle global challenges," State House spokesman Hussein Mohamed said.


On Tuesday, he is due to visit studios owned by entertainment mogul Tyler Perry, who has championed greater diversity in Hollywood to "explore opportunities within the creative economy."


Ruto will meet a Congressional delegation on Wednesday and call for the extension of a free trade agreement — the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) — which eliminates import tariffs on goods from eligible African nations.


The pact expires in 2025, prompting African leaders to seek clarity on future arrangements.


Most of Kenya's imports are from China — also one of its biggest bilateral creditors — and Washington has been keen to eat into Beijing's clout in the region.


The East African nation began talks with the United States on a free trade agreement in 2020 but nothing has been signed.


In 2022, the United States exported goods worth $604 million to Kenya while imports totaled $875 million, according to the Office of the US Trade Representative.


Kenyan Trade Minister Rebecca Miano said there were "very big opportunities" for investment in the country.


"We have prepared more than 30 bankable projects worth over $20.5 billion to interest American investors and the Kenyan diaspora," she told local media last week.


'Extremely disappointed'


A request for Ruto to address a joint session of Congress fell through after House Speaker Mike Johnson of the Republican Party declined to extend an invitation.


Lawmakers from Biden's Democratic Party last week accused Johnson of disrespecting Africa, saying they were "extremely disappointed" by the decision.


The last African leader to address Congress was Liberia's Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the continent's first female elected head of state, in 2006.


The visit "feels a bit like a fig leaf" for Africa, the Center for Strategic and International Studies said, as it comes after Biden broke a promise to visit Africa last year.


Kenyan historian Macharia Munene also cautioned that Nairobi's future relationship with Washington would hinge on the outcome of the November US presidential election.


Ruto is currently "America's blue-eyed boy" and is "hobnobbing" with Biden, a situation that could change if Donald Trump wins the presidency again, he said in an opinion piece for The Standard newspaper.

## KDE Plasma 6 comes to OpenBSD

date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News

Last year marked a significant milestone for both myself and the OpenBSD desktop community, as we successfully ported KDE Plasma 5 and all dependencies to OpenBSD. With the release of OpenBSD 7.5 on April 5, 2024, KDE Plasma in version 5.27.10 has become a part of our lovely operating system. This success is the result of years of development work and commitment to achieving this goal. KDE launched version 6 of its Plasma desktop environment on February 28, 2024, bringing numerous updates and features as well as the major switch to Qt6. I am immensely proud that the OpenBSD team has managed to prepare for this major update so swiftly. All necessary components have been committed to our CVS tree, and the packages will soon be available. ↫ Rafael Sadowski Excellent news for OpenBSD users who don&#8217;t wish to be using GNOME, Xfce, or one of the smaller build-it-yourself desktop environments. My dual-Xeon workstation, which I switched over from Fedora KDE to OpenBSD, runs Xfce, because I feel a smaller desktop environment is a more natural fit for OpenBSD, but I&#8217;m very happy to know that I have KDE to fall back on in case Xfce turns out not to be a good fit for me in the long term. I&#8217;ll give the OpenBSD developers an other experts in that community some more time to iron out any wrinkles, and then I&#8217;ll probably give it a go to see just how well KDE will be integrated with the OpenBSD base system.

## Windows Server 2025 to ship with DTrace by default

date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News

Windows Server 2025 comes equipped with dtrace as a native tool. DTrace is a command-line utility that enables users to monitor and troubleshoot their system&#8217;s performance in real-time. DTrace allows users to dynamically instrument both the kernel and user-space code without any need to modify the code itself. This versatile tool supports a range of data collection and analysis techniques, such as aggregations, histograms, and tracing of user-level events. To learn more, see DTrace for command line help and DTrace on Windows for additional capabilities. ↫ What&#8217;s new in Windows Server 2025 DTrace was originally developed by Sun as part of Solaris, but eventually made its way to other operating systems as Sun collapsed in on itself and Oracle gave it the final push. DTrace is available for the various surviving Solars-based operating systems, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, macOS, and QNX, and Microsoft ported DTrace from FreeBSD to Windows back in 2018. With Windows Server 2025, DTrace will be shipped out of the box.

## Wikileaks’ Assange can appeal US extradition on freedom of speech grounds

date: 2024-05-20, from: VOA News USA

London — The United States government’s attempts to extradite Wikileaks founder Julian Assange from Britain on charges of espionage took another legal twist Monday, as a British court ruled he must be given the right to a full appeal against the order on freedom of speech grounds. 


The hearing at London’s High Court on Monday was the last legal hope for Wikileaks founder Julian Assange to halt his imminent extradition to the United States.  


Two of the three judges ruled that a full appeal hearing must be held into whether the 52-year-old Australian citizen would be able to rely on the U.S. First Amendment right to free speech, in an American court. 


“This is good news because it means that the Julian Assange case can now proceed to a hearing that will substantively consider the freedom of expression arguments,” said Simon Crowther, a legal adviser at Amnesty International.




Assange’s lawyers successfully argued that U.S. government assurances that he could “seek to rely” on those First Amendment rights were inadequate. A new appeal process could take months or years. 


Barry Pollack, a member of Assange’s legal team, described the ruling as a significant milestone. “The High Court is going to hear the vitally important issues of whether someone should be extradited to the United States for having published truthful, newsworthy information.” 


“The United States should never have brought this case. It is utterly inconsistent with First Amendment values and all that the United States says that it believes. And I hope the United States will take a hard look at this decision and maybe reconsider whether they want [to] pursue this fundamentally flawed case,” Pollack said at a news conference following the ruling Monday. 


Assange was not in court Monday due to ill health. His wife, Stella Assange, said it was the correct ruling.




“As a family, we are relieved. But how long can this go on? The United States should read the situation and drop this case now. Now is the moment to do it. Just abandon this shameful attack on journalists, on the press and the public that has been going on for 14 years. This case is shameful, and it is taking an enormous toll on Julian. He is under enormous pressure. He has been in Belmarsh Prison for over five years,” she told hundreds of supporters outside the court. 




U.S. prosecutors have filed 18 charges against Assange, relating to allegations of hacking and theft of classified material. They did not immediately comment on Monday’s court ruling. 


In 2010, WikiLeaks published thousands of stolen diplomatic cables relating to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, which Assange said exposed abuses by the United States military. The U.S. government argues his actions went beyond journalism by soliciting, stealing and indiscriminately publishing classified government documents that endangered innocent lives. 


The case sets a vital precedent, said Amnesty’s Simon Crowther. “What Julian Assange is being prosecuted for is something journalists do all the time: they receive classified material that exposes war crimes or alleged war crimes, or crimes against humanity, serious human rights violations. And when it’s in the public interest, they publish those documents,” Crowther told VOA. 


Assange has spent the past five years in London’s Belmarsh high security jail.  


Prior to that, he sought refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London for seven years after Swedish prosecutors charged him with two counts of rape, which he denied. The charges were later dropped. Assange was jailed for breaching his bail conditions. The U.S. Justice Department first formally requested his extradition in 2019. 


In the coming months, Assange will have the right to bring a new appeal before the British courts, where he will argue that the U.S. judicial system would deny him his right to free speech.

## The latest in the tense back-and-forth between the U.S. and China

Plus, health care providers continue to reel from a February cyberattack, and analysts worry about the adverse effects of Google&#8217;s AI-powered search results.</p>

## May 19, 2024

date: 2024-05-20, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

Delivering the commencement address to the graduating seniors at Morehouse College today, President Joe Biden addressed the nation. After thanking the mothers, fathers, grandmothers, grandfathers, and all the people who helped the graduates get to the chairs in front of the stage, Biden recalled Morehouse&#8217;s history. The school was founded in 1867 by civil rights leader Reverend William Jefferson White with the help of two other Baptist ministers, the Reverend Richard C. Coulter and the Reverend Edmund Turney, to educate formerly enslaved men. They believed &#8220;education would be the great equalizer from slavery to freedom,&#8221; Biden said, and they created an institution that would make the term &#8220;Morehouse man&#8221; continue to stand as a symbol of excellence 157 years later.

## 11 hurt in mass shooting in Savannah, Georgia

date: 2024-05-20, from: VOA News USA

SAVANNAH, Ga.  — An argument between two women led to a gunfight that left 11 people hurt in a busy tourist area of Savannah, Georgia, late Saturday, one of five weekend shootings in the city, two of which were fatal, authorities said.


Two people were injured in separate shootings Friday. Two more shootings Saturday resulted in two deaths. Then came the gunfire just before midnight Saturday near Savannah's Ellis Square.


The shooting broke out as two women argued in an area business, according to Police Chief Lenny Gunther, who didn't name the establishment.


"One shot rang out. That triggered other individuals to shoot," he said. "We had multiple individuals discharge their weapons to shoot at each other, which resulted in multiple people getting shot."


Ten of the 11 injured were hit by gunfire. Authorities did not say what caused the 11th injury. Victims were treated at the scene and "several" were taken to a hospital, police said. None of the injuries appeared life threatening.


Mayor Van Johnson said a proliferation of guns was a factor in the shootings and that reasonable gun control laws are needed. He also stressed the need for gun owners to keep their weapons from being stolen and for people carrying guns to know how and when to use them.


"We have to insist on smart gun laws," Johnson said at a Sunday news conference. "And then, on the other end, we have to insist that people act responsibly with those weapons."


The mass shooting happened a week ahead of the tourist-heavy Memorial Day weekend. Gunther sought to assure people that police staffing will be sufficient to keep the public safe.


Ellis Square is in Savannah's historic district, an area popular among tourists and locals. It was developed in 2010 and is known for a large fountain and a life-sized statue of songwriter Johnny Mercer.


The first two of Savannah's weekend shootings happened Friday. Each of those resulted in a non-life-threatening injury and an arrest. On Saturday, police answering a call about a home invasion found a dead juvenile at the home. Initial reports are that shots were fired after a resident confronted an armed intruder.


Still another shooting was reported at a Savannah intersection Saturday night that left one man dead and a juvenile injured.

## pg_dumpbinary v2.17 released

date: 2024-05-20, from: PostgreSQL News

<p><strong>Grenoble, France - Mai 20, 2024</strong></p>
<h2>pg_dumpbinary</h2>
<p><code>pg_dumpbinary</code> dumps a PostgreSQL database to a binary format. The resulting dump must be restored
using <code>pg_restorebinary</code>, which is provided.</p>
<p>This release adds two new options to command pg_restorebinary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add option <code>-C, --create</code> to pg_restorebinary to create the database
  before restoring into it. Like with pg_restore you must provide a
  database to connect using the <code>-d</code> option.</li>
<li>Add <code>--dump-create</code> to print to stdout the create and alter database
  statements.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>pg_dumpbinary</code> is useful when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have bytea that can not be exported by <code>pg_dump</code> because the
  total size of the escape/hex output exceeds 1Gb.</li>
<li>You have custom type that stores <code>\0</code> internally in bytea but data
  are exported by pg_dump as char/varchar/text.  In this case pg_dump
  truncates all data after the first <code>\0</code>, resulting in data loss.</li>
<li>Other cases where a binary output format is useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these kinds of cases <code>pg_dumpbinary</code> helps by dumping the
PostgreSQL database in a binary format. In all other cases
the pg_dump/pg_restore commands distributed with PostgreSQL are
preferred.</p>
<p>See the documentation for a more complete description of available
features.</p>
<h2>Links &amp; Credits</h2>
