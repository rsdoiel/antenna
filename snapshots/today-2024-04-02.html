Muyao Shen explains the concept of the Left Curve in

Big Winners of This Crypto Bull Market Are the `Left
Curves’</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
There is a surprising amount of respect for people who appear to know
nothing about the industry. They’re known as the “left curves.”<br />
<br /> The nickname comes from a popular meme in crypto that shows a
bell curve with investors on the left who know nothing, or very little,
and those in the fat middle of the curve who know something about
crypto. On the right are investors who seemingly know everything.

Why does Shen think those who know nothing about cryptocurrencies are
the big winners? Because they are jumping in to yet another
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-21/the-big-winners-of-this-crypto-bull-market-are-the-left-curves">cruptocurrency
bubble</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
For example, a crypto project with pseudonymous co-founders including
“Smokey The Bera” and “Dev Bear” has become a unicorn after it raised
millions of dollars from institutional investors such as Brevan Howard
Digital. Another token with no real utility — only a cute picture of a
dog wearing a hat — has increased by more than 1,400 times its value
from three months ago. A developer of a sloth-themed memecoin called
Slerf claimed they accidentally burned a large amount of the tokens
after raising $10 million.<br /> <br /> What a great time to be a left
curve! In this bull market, forget about highbrow ideas like revamping
Wall Street. Give up on dreams of replacing traditional artwork with
nonfungible tokens. Instead, don’t overthink it. Just

writes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
How did this happen? How did crypto’s greatest comeback take place so
fast, so hilariously and — at times — so stupidly? Why did crypto
evangelists give up their dreams? At its core, it’s because the market
is still living under the shadows of past catastrophes like FTX’s
collapse and TerraUSD’s blowup.<br /> <br /> In the past bull markets,
when Bitcoin went up, everything else went up amid small-scale rotations
between major and small-cap coins. But in this bull market, the rotation
is more severe: As Solana went up in the past month, the price of Ether
went down dramatically — a simple piece of evidence that shows there’s
less money being thrown at the crypto market today than three years ago.
</blockquote>
The “past catastrophes like FTX’s collapse and TerraUSD’s blowup” may be
old news but to their victims they aren’t even close to over. The best
FTX’s creditors can hope for is to get back what their HODL-ings were
worth <i>before</i> Bitcoin took off moon-wards, and who knows when that
might happen.<br /> <br /> Kevin T. Dugan’s
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html"><i>The
Crypto World Has a New Villain</i></a> starts with the story of one
victim of yet another “past catastrophe”:<br />
<blockquote>
“I had no idea who Barry Silbert was or anything until after November
16, 2022,” Eric Asquith told me. That date was when he was pretty sure
he had lost his family’s savings of $1,052,000.
</blockquote>
Asquith wasn’t on the Left Curve but just a bit
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">left
of the middle</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
He didn’t buy bitcoin or other meme tokens. Instead, earlier that year,
he moved over cash from his business — just a little at first, then more
— and converted it into digital currencies he thought were as good as
cash. The digital coins were called GUSD, and each was worth exactly $1
because the company that minted them —
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/12/how-the-winkleviis-second-act-in-bitcoin-went-bad.html">Tyler
and Cameron Winklevoss’s crypto exchange, Gemini</a> — backed each one
with real money and assets.
</blockquote>
But Asquith’s GUSD were deposited into Gemini’s Earn program to get its
5.5% interest, far more than banks were paying. But Asquith and the
other Earn depositors were far enough left on the curve that they didn’t
know Earn
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">wasn’t
like a bank savings account</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
What Asquith did not fully understand was that his money was no longer
with Gemini. In one sense, Genesis, a crypto company owned by Barry
Silbert had it, but even that wasn’t quite true. Soon-to-collapse hedge
funds with names like Three Arrows Capital and Alameda Research — Sam
Bankman-Fried’s personal fund — were quietly borrowing from Silbert’s
shop. Asquith’s money, and that of tens of thousands of others, was
being used by SBF and others to make giant bets on some of the
highest-flying, most volatile digital tokens.
</blockquote>
Then Terra/Luna collapsed and things started to fall apart. Amy Castor
and David Gerard
<a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2022/11/25/crypto-collapse-ftx-first-day-hearing-genesis-screws-dcg-silvergate-bank/">reported</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
One of Genesis’s biggest customers was Three Arrows Capital (3AC), who
they’d lent $2.4 billion. After 3AC blew up in May, DCG assumed $1.2
billion of the liabilities to keep the hit off Genesis’ books. Genesis
had been the single largest creditor of 3AC.<br /> <br /> Genesis also
had money on FTX. As FTX was falling apart, Genesis tweeted on November
8 that they had no exposure, and it was fine. Two days later, Genesis
admitted they had “~$175M in locked funds in our FTX trading account,”
and they were not fine.<br /> <br /> Genesis scrambled to find more
capital. Genesis and DCG needed $1 billion in emergency credit by 10
a.m. EST on November 14, but didn’t get it. Even Binance turned them
down.<br /> <br /> So two days later, Genesis suspended
withdrawals,<br /> …<br /> One of Genesis’s biggest customers is Gemini
Trust, run by the Winklevoss twins, that operated its own “yield”
program, Gemini Earn, for retail investors.<br /> <br /> Gemini was
supposed to be the safe exchange — but it was exposed to risks via
Genesis. There’s now $700 million that Gemini Earn customers can’t
withdraw — because it’s stuck on Genesis.

to get the cash</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
On January 8, Gemini terminated the Master Loan Agreement with Genesis
and emailed customers accordingly. This “requires Genesis to return all
outstanding assets in the program.” Genesis did not return the funds by
the end of January 10 — so they were officially in default on the loan.
At this point, Genesis can pull the pin and try to put Gemini into
involuntary bankruptcy.
</blockquote>
They did, and there followed a year of legal wrangling between Gemini,
Genesis and Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, which owns Genesis.
The
<a href="https://amycastor.com/2023/01/13/sec-sues-genesis-and-gemini-genesis-owes-3-billion-to-creditors/">SEC
sued both Gemini and Genesis</a>, and so did
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">the
New York Attorney General</a>. While the wrangling continued, another of
the semi-regular cryptocurrency bull markets took off until
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">in
February 2024</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
the victims, Silbert’s now-bankrupt crypto-lending operation, the
Winklevoss twins, and regulators hammered out a deal to pay everybody
back in full. The crypto bull market of 2024 made it possible to pay
back Earn customers not some fraction of what they invested but the
generally much higher sum of what their holdings would now be worth.
</blockquote>
Everyone started
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">cele:wbrating</a>;<br />
<blockquote>
Except there was Silbert. Earn victims who had been unfamiliar with him
would soon learn that he had made his first fortune by studying the ins
and outs of the bankruptcy system and using it to his financial
advantage. Since February, the billionaire investor has been relying on
a controversial interpretation of bankruptcy law to stop Asquith and all
the other victims from getting the bigger payout, the one based on
current prices. Instead, to simplify a bit, he would prefer to keep that
money himself. “DCG cannot support a plan that not only deprives DCG of
its corporate governance rights but also violates United States
bankruptcy code,” a spokeswoman for the company said.<br /> <br /> The
victims have taken to calling it “the Barry Trade”: If Silbert is
successful, he would be able to pocket as much as $1 billion in funds
that would otherwise be returned to them. At the very least, Silbert may
substantially delay the money being returned to Earn customers.<br />
…<br /> Silbert’s legal logic is that the bankruptcy code sets a date to
value victims’ claims in U.S. dollars, and in Genesis’ case, it just
happened to be around the market’s lows.
</blockquote>
People started
<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/genesis-and-gemini-winklevoss-twins-crypto-firms-charged-by-sec">talking
to the press about Gemini</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Former Gemini employees told The Beast that Gemini Earn’s terms and
conditions were highly dubious from the outset. One staffer recalled
reading the fine print for the first time, saying, “[We] were like,
‘Holy shit, are you fucking kidding me?’”<br /> <br /> Among those
terms: Customer assets were loaned out on “an unsecured basis,” which
meant that their money would not be safe in the event of a market
collapse. The deposits were also not insured, nor were they guaranteed
against errors or fraudulent activity.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">And
Genesis</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
“Whatever Gemini may or may not have done pales in comparison to what
you see at Genesis, which was more than negligent when it came to
protecting customer assets and complying with general best practices,”
one former employee said. Among those problems, the person said, was not
screening clients who were on, say, the Treasury’s blacklists — an
allegation that was supported by a separate January suit filed by New
York Department of Financial Services.
</blockquote>
This isn’t a “past catastrophe”. For the victims
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">there
is no end in sight</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
A ruling isn’t expected until April. Since the settlement announcement,
the victims have resigned themselves to an even longer wait as Silbert
continues to fight. “A year ago, there was a deal that was proposed.
Everyone was celebrating in a very similar way,” Asquith said. “Now,
I’ll believe it when it’s in my account.”

vessel uses alternate channel to bypass wreckage at Baltimore bridge
collapse site</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Baltimore — A tugboat pushing a fuel barge was the first vessel to
use an alternate channel to bypass the wreckage of Baltimore’s collapsed
Francis Scott Key Bridge, which had blocked traffic along the vital
port’s main shipping channel.</p>
<p>The barge supplying jet fuel to the Department of Defense left late
Monday and was destined for Delaware’s Dover Air Force Base, though
officials have said the temporary channel is open primarily to vessels
that are helping with the cleanup effort. Some barges and tugs that have
been stuck in the Port of Baltimore since the collapse are also
scheduled to pass through the channel. </p>
<p>Officials said they’re working on a second channel on the southwest
side of the main channel that will allow for deeper draft vessels, but
they didn’t say when that might open. </p>
<p>Gov. Wes Moore is set Tuesday to visit one of two centers that the
Small Business Administration opened in the area to help companies get
loans to assist them with losses caused by the disruption of the bridge
collapse. </p>
<p>Crews are undertaking the complicated work of removing steel and
concrete at the site of the bridge’s deadly collapse after a container
ship lost power and crashed into a supporting column. On Sunday, dive
teams surveyed parts of the bridge and checked the ship, and workers in
lifts used torches to cut above-water parts of the twisted steel
superstructure. </p>
<p>Authorities believe six workers plunged to their deaths in the
collapse, including two whose bodies were recovered last week. Two other
workers survived. </p>
<p>Moore, a Democrat, said at a Monday afternoon news conference that
his top priority is recovering the four remaining bodies, followed by
reopening shipping channels. He said that he understands the urgency but
that the risks are significant. Crews have described the mangled steel
girders of the fallen bridge as “chaotic wreckage,” he said. </p>
<p>“What we’re finding is it is more complicated than we hoped for
initially,” said U.S. Coast Guard Rear Admiral Shannon Gilreath. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the ship remains stationary, and its 21 crew members
remain on board for now, officials said. </p>
<p>President Joe Biden is expected to visit the collapse site Friday to
meet with state and local officials and get at federal response
efforts. </p>
<p>The bridge fell as the cargo ship Dali lost power March 26 shortly
after leaving Baltimore on its way to Sri Lanka. The ship issued a
mayday alert, which allowed just enough time for police to stop traffic,
but not enough to save a roadwork crew filling potholes on the
bridge. </p>
<p>The Dali is managed by Synergy Marine Group and owned by Grace Ocean
Private Ltd., both of Singapore. Danish shipping giant Maersk chartered
the Dali. </p>
<p>Synergy and Grace Ocean filed a court petition Monday seeking to
limit their legal liability, a routine but important procedure for cases
litigated under U.S. maritime law. A federal court in Maryland will
ultimately decide who is responsible and how much they owe. </p>
<p>The filing seeks to cap the companies’ liability at roughly $43.6
million. It estimates that the vessel itself is valued at up to $90
million and was owed over $1.1 million in income from freight. The
estimate also deducts two major expenses: at least $28 million in repair
costs and at least $19.5 million in salvage costs. </p>
<p>Officials are trying to determine how to rebuild the major bridge,
which was completed in 1977. It carried Interstate 695 around southeast
Baltimore and became a symbol of the city’s working-class roots and
maritime culture. </p>
<p>Congress is expected to consider aid packages to help people who lose
jobs or businesses because of the prolonged closure of the Port of
Baltimore. The port handles more cars and farm equipment than any other
U.S. facility.</p>

A mere eight months after initially launching its N7 SUV in China, BYD
sub-brand Denza has followed up with a refreshed version with better
technology and significantly lower starting prices. Initially targeting
potential Model Y customers, the N7’s sales have yet to reach
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/denza/">Denza’s</a> expectations,
leading to today’s new demand levers and some new subsidies for
switching to the updated model.

to</a> <em>Bloomberg</em>, with analysts forecasting global deliveries
of about 449,080 vehicles, down 7%. “Some on Wall Street are even braced
for Tesla’s first sales decline since the early days of the pandemic.”

Chinese rival BYD

a 43% drop in quarterly sales. Analysts expect Rivian to deliver 16,608

in favor</a> of environmental group Friends of the Earth Netherlands and
ordered Shell to cut its greenhouse gas emissions (including scope 3
emissions) by 45% by 2030. “This was the mother of all climate cases
against corporations” because it opened the door to copycat cases, Klaas
Hendrik Eller, an assistant professor at the University of Amsterdam’s
center for transformative private law,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d0393c9c2f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a>
the <em>Financial Times</em>. Shell is appealing, insisting the order
lacks legal basis and that companies cannot be held responsible for
their clients’ emissions. Friends of the Earth will argue that the
scientific evidence shows burning fossil fuels is causing global warming
and that “Shell has a responsibility to act in accordance with climate
science and international climate agreements.” A ruling is expected in
the second half of this year.

<strong></strong>More than 30,200 fires were detected in Venezuela
between January and March, the highest number ever recorded for that
three-month period. The region is suffering from intense drought driven
by human-caused climate change and the El Niño weather pattern.
Researchers are worried these fires are a sign of things to come.
“Everything is indicating we’re going to see other events of
catastrophic fires – megafires that are huge in size and height,”
Manoela Machado, a fire researcher at University of Oxford,

in a human in Texas, marking the first such case since the virus was
recently identified in cows across several states, and only the second

populations across the world and also spread to mammals, including
seals, mink, and now cows. Health experts worry the virus could mutate
to become easily transmissible between humans, but so far there is no
evidence of that happening. Still, “every single time is a little bit of

Skyrocketing production out of China means solar panels are cheap and
getting cheaper. But at the same time, installation costs for rooftop
solar remain high, prompting some DIY-minded homeowners to roll up their
sleeves and install panels as fencing. The panels don’t get quite as
much sun as they would on a rooftop, but they still work. No word on
what the neighbors have to say about it. Peculiar garden aesthetics
aside, the solar glut has “brought Europe’s solar makers to their
knees,” <em>Politico</em>

id="fedora-change-proposal-suggests-switching-the-main-fedora-workstation-release-to-kde-plasma">Fedora
change proposal suggests switching the main Fedora Workstation release
to KDE Plasma</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Update: the proposal has now been formally announced on the devel
mailing list and Fedora Discussions. I have been assured by the main
author of the proposal itself that this is very much not an April Fools
joke, but of course, there’s still the very real possibility we’re being
led on here. Still, I’m taking the risk and treating this as a serious
change proposal for Fedora, even though it’s likely to cause some
controversy in the wider Fedora community. The proposal is written by
Joshua Strobl, the lead developer of Budgie. Yes, this is a change
proposal to make KDE the default desktop environment of Fedora
Workstation. The reasoning is that KDE is more approachable for new
users than GNOME, it supports standards better, the industry seems to be
making moves to KDE (see the Steam Deck), and so on. KDE also has more
advanced features people have come to expect from a desktop, like HDR,
VRR, and more, and it’s the more advanced Wayland desktop. The important
note here is that in the highly unlikely event this proposal would be
accepted, it’s not like current Fedora GNOME users will be ‘upgraded’ to
KDE when Fedora 42 gets released. The idea is to promote the current
Fedora Plasma spin to the main Fedora Workstation release, and demote
the Fedora GNOME release to a mere Fedora spin, like KDE is now. While I
would personally support this change, it’s pretty much 100% unlikely
this change proposal will make it through. Red Hat and Fedora are
entirely GNOME-first, and no matter how much I believe that’s misguided
when looking at the state of the two primary open source desktops today,
that’s not going to change. Still, it’s an interesting discussion point,
if only to highlight that the frustrations with GNOME run a lot deeper
than people seem to think.</p>

is diagnosed with bird flu after being in contact with cows in
Texas</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ATLANTA — A person in Texas has been diagnosed with bird flu, an
infection tied to the recent discovery of the virus in dairy cows,
health officials said Monday.</p>
<p>The patient was being treated with an antiviral drug and their only
reported symptom was eye redness, Texas health officials said. Health
officials say the person had been in contact with cows presumed to be
infected, and the risk to the public remains low. </p>
<p>It marks the first known instance globally of a person catching this
version of bird flu from a mammal, federal health officials said.</p>
<p>However, there’s no evidence of person-to-person spread or that
anyone has become infected from milk or meat from livestock, said
Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Genetic tests don’t suggest that the virus suddenly is spreading more
easily or that it is causing more severe illness, Shah said. And current
antiviral medications still seem to work, he added.</p>
<p>Last week, dairy cows in Texas and Kansas were reported to be
infected with bird flu — and federal agriculture officials later
confirmed infections in a Michigan dairy herd that had recently received
cows from Texas. None of the hundreds of affected cows have died, Shah
said.</p>
<p>Since 2020, a bird flu virus has been spreading among more animal
species – including dogs, cats, skunks, bears and even seals and
porpoises – in scores of countries. </p>
<p>However, the detection in U.S. livestock is an “unexpected and
problematic twist,” said Dr. Ali Khan, a former CDC outbreak
investigator who is now dean of the University of Nebraska’s public
health college.</p>
<p>This bird flu was first identified as a threat to people during a
1997 outbreak in Hong Kong. More than 460 people have died in the past
two decades from bird flu infections, according to the World Health
Organization. </p>
<p>Most infected people got it directly from birds, but scientists have
been on guard for any sign of spread among people. </p>
<p>Texas officials didn’t identify the newly infected person, nor
release any details about what brought them in contact with the
cows.</p>
<p>The CDC does not recommend testing for people who have no symptoms.
Roughly a dozen people in Texas who did have symptoms were tested in
connection with the dairy cow infections, but only the one person came
back positive, Shah said.</p>
<p>It’s only the second time a person in the United States has been
diagnosed with what’s known as Type A H5N1 virus. In 2022, a prison
inmate in a work program picked it up while killing infected birds at a
poultry farm in Montrose County, Colorado. His only symptom was fatigue,
and he recovered.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, March 26, Judge Juan Merchan, who is presiding over
Trump’s election interference case, put Trump under a gag order to stop
his attacks on court staff, prosecutors, jurors, and witnesses. On
Wednesday, Trump renewed his attacks on the judge and the judge’s
daughter. On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton took the
unusual step of talking publicly about what threats of violence meant to
the rule of law. Walton, who was appointed to the federal bench by
President George W. Bush, told Kaitlan Collins of CNN that threats,
especially threats to a judge’s family, undermine the ability of judges
to carry out their duties.</p>

<h2 id="us-britain-announce-partnership-on-ai-safety-testing">US,
Britain announce partnership on AI safety, testing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States and Britain on Monday announced a new
partnership on the science of artificial intelligence safety, amid
growing concerns about upcoming next-generation versions.</p>
<p>Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and British Technology Secretary
Michelle Donelan signed a memorandum of understanding in Washington to
jointly develop advanced AI model testing, following commitments
announced at an AI Safety Summit in Bletchley Park in November.</p>
<p>“We all know AI is the defining technology of our generation,”
Raimondo said. “This partnership will accelerate both of our institutes
work across the full spectrum to address the risks of our national
security concerns and the concerns of our broader society.”</p>
<p>Britain and the United States are among countries establishing
government-led AI safety institutes.</p>
<p>Britain said in October its institute would examine and test new
types of AI, while the United States said in November it was launching
its own safety institute to evaluate risks from so-called frontier AI
models and is now working with 200 companies and entites.</p>
<p>Under the formal partnership, Britain and the United States plan to
perform at least one joint testing exercise on a publicly accessible
model and are considering exploring personnel exchanges between the
institutes. Both are working to develop similar partnerships with other
countries to promote AI safety.</p>
<p>“This is the first agreement of its kind anywhere in the world,”
Donelan said. “AI is already an extraordinary force for good in our
society and has vast potential to tackle some of the world’s biggest
challenges, but only if we are able to grip those risks.”</p>
<p>Generative AI, which can create text, photos and videos in response
to open-ended prompts, has spurred excitement as well as fears it could
make some jobs obsolete, upend elections and potentially overpower
humans and catastrophic effects.</p>
<p>In a joint interview with Reuters Monday, Raimondo and Donelan urgent
joint action was needed to address AI risks.</p>
<p>“Time is of the essence because the next set of models are about to
be released, which will be much, much more capable,” Donelan said. “We
have a focus one the areas that we are dividing and conquering and
really specializing.”</p>
<p>Raimondo said she would raise AI issues at a meeting of the U.S.-EU
Trade and Technology Council in Belgium Thursday.</p>
<p>The Biden administration plans to soon announce additions to its AI
team, Raimondo said. “We are pulling in the full resources of the U.S.
government.”</p>
<p>Both countries plan to share key information on capabilities and
risks associated with AI models and systems and technical research on AI
safety and security.</p>
<p>In October, Biden signed an executive order that aims to reduce the
risks of AI. In January, the Commerce Department said it was proposing
to require U.S. cloud companies to determine whether foreign entities
are accessing U.S. data centers to train AI models.</p>
<p>Britain said in February it would spend more than 100 million pounds
($125.5 million) to launch nine new research hubs and AI train
regulators about the technology.</p>
<p>Raimondo said she was especially concerned about the threat of AI
applied to bioterrorism or a nuclear war simulation.</p>
<p>“Those are the things where the consequences could be catastrophic
and so we really have to have zero tolerance for some of these models
being used for that capability,” she said.</p>

expands gag order after Trump’s social media posts about judge’s
daughter</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — The judge in Donald Trump’s hush-money criminal case
expanded the former president’s gag order Monday after the former
president assailed the judge’s daughter and made a false claim about her
on social media last week.</p>
<p>Judge Juan M. Merchan said his original gag order issued last Tuesday
did not include members of his family, but Trump’s subsequent actions
warranted including them.</p>
<p>Merchan’s daughter, Loren Merchan, is a Democratic political
consultant. Prosecutors had urged Merchan to clarify or expand his gag
order after Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform that Loren Merchan
“makes money by working to ‘Get Trump,’” and wrongly accused her of
posting a social media photo showing him behind bars.</p>
<p>The trial, which involves allegations Trump falsified payment records
in a scheme to cover up negative stories during his 2016 presidential
campaign, is scheduled to begin April 15. Trump denies wrongdoing and
has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers had fought the gag order and its expansion, arguing
that Trump was engaging in protected political campaign speech.</p>

id="last-survivor-of-uss-arizona-from-pearl-harbor-attack-dies-at-102">Last
survivor of USS Arizona from Pearl Harbor attack, dies at 102</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>honolulu — Lou Conter, the last living survivor of the USS Arizona
battleship that exploded and sank during the Japanese bombing of Pearl
Harbor, has died. He was 102.</p>
<p>Conter passed away Monday at his home in Grass Valley, California,
following congestive heart failure, his daughter, Louann Daley said,
adding she was beside him along with two of her brothers, James and
Jeff.</p>
<p>The Arizona lost 1,177 sailors and Marines in the 1941 attack that
launched the United States into World War II. The battleship’s dead
account for nearly half of those killed in the attack.</p>
<p>Conter was a quartermaster, standing on the main deck of the Arizona
as Japanese planes flew overhead at 7:55 a.m. on December 7 that year.
Sailors were just beginning to hoist colors or raise the flag when the
assault began.</p>
<p>Conter recalled how one bomb penetrated steel decks 13 minutes into
the battle and set off more than 1 million pounds (450,000 kilograms) of
gunpowder stored below. The explosion lifted the battleship 30 to 40
feet (9 to 12 meters) out of the water, he said during a 2008 oral
history interview stored at the Library of Congress. Everything was on
fire from the mainmast forward, he said.</p>
<p>“Guys were running out of the fire and trying to jump over the
sides,” Conter said. “Oil all over the sea was burning.”</p>
<p>His autobiography The Lou Conter Story recounts how he joined other
survivors tending to the injured, many of them blinded and badly burned.
The sailors only abandoned ship when their senior surviving officer was
sure they had rescued all those still alive.</p>
<p>The rusting wreckage of the Arizona still lies where it sank. More
than 900 sailors and Marines remain entombed inside. Only 335 Arizona
crew members survived.</p>
<p>Conter went to flight school after Pearl Harbor, earning his wings to
fly PBY patrol bombers, which the Navy used to look for submarines and
bomb enemy targets. He flew 200 combat missions in the Pacific with a
“Black Cats” squadron, which conducted dive bombing at night in planes
painted black.</p>
<p>In 1943, he and his crew were shot down in waters near New Guinea and
had to avoid sharks. A sailor expressed doubt they would survive, to
which Conter replied, “baloney.”</p>
<p>“Don’t ever panic in any situation. Survive is the first thing you
tell them. Don’t panic or you’re dead,” he said. They were quiet and
treaded water until another plane came hours later and dropped a
lifeboat on them.</p>
<p>In the late 1950s, he was made the Navy’s first SERE officer — an
acronym for survival, evasion, resistance and escape. He spent the next
decade training Navy pilots and crew on how to survive if they’re shot
down in the jungle and captured as a prisoner of war. Some of his pupils
used his lessons as POWs in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Conter retired in 1967 after 28 years in the Navy.</p>
<p>Conter was born in Ojibwa, Wisconsin, on Sept. 13, 1921. His family
later moved to Colorado. He enlisted in the Navy after he turned 18,
getting $17 a month and a hammock for his bunk at boot camp.</p>
<p>With Conter’s death, there are now 19 survivors of the Pearl Harbor
attack still living, according to Kathleen Farley, the California state
chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. About 87,000
military personnel were on Oahu on Dec. 7, according to a rough estimate
compiled by military historian J. Michael Wenger.</p>
<p>In his later years, Conter became a fixture at annual remembrance
ceremonies in Pearl Harbor that the Navy and the National Park Service
jointly hosted on the anniversaries of the 1941 attack. When he lacked
the strength to attend in person, he recorded video messages for those
who gathered and watched remotely from his home in California.</p>
<p>In 2019, when he was 98, he said he liked going to such events, to
remember those who lost their lives.</p>
<p>“It’s always good to come back and pay respect to them and give them
the top honors that they deserve,” he said.</p>

<p>
Harley-Davidson’s LiveWire company unveiled its third electric
motorcycle in March: the S2 Mulholland. At first glance, the electric
cruiser closely resembles the existing LiveWire S2 Del Mar. That’s
thanks to the shared Arrow platform fulfilling its purpose of spanning
multiple electric motorbikes.
</p>
<p>
Still, there are a number of key differences between the S2 models that
make these two distinct bikes. While we’ll have to wait for an extensive
review, I recently completed a LiveWire S2 Mulholland test ride and have
some initial impressions.

<h2 id="gcc-10-ported-to-qnx-6.5-sp1">GCC 10 ported to QNX 6.5 SP1</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Way back in the day, back when I wasn’t even working at OSNews yet, I
used to run QNX as my desktop operating system, together with a small
number of other enthusiasts. It was a struggle, for sure, but it was
fun, exciting, and nobody else was crazy enough to do so. Sadly, the
small QNX desktop community wasn’t even remotely interesting to QNX, and
later Blackberry when they acquired the company, and eventually the
stand-alone Neutrino-powered version of QNX disappeared behind confusing
signup screens and other dark patterns. It meant the end of our small
little community. Much to my utter surprise and delight, I saw a post by
js about how he ported GCC 10 to QNX – in this case, to QNX 6.5 SP1,
released in 2012 – and submitted it to pkgsrc. His ultimate goal is to
port one of his other projects, ObjFW, to QNX. He makes use of pkgsrc to
do this kind of work, which also means he had to make pkgsrc bootstrap
and a lot of other software work on QNX. We’re at QNX 8.0 by now, and as
much as I bang my head against QNX and BlackBerry’s wall of marketing
and corporate speak, I just can’t find out if it’s even still possible
to download QNX Neutrino and install it on real generic hardware

<p>
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@Shufei" title="@Shufei@mastodon.sdf.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Shufei">@Shufei</span></a> asks what we’ll
do with all the billionaires if we survive the next decade, the next
century. Like I said in that post about Israel and Palestine, it’s worth
imagining positive outcomes and then think about the intermediate steps.
So, assuming we make it, what happened?
</p>
<p>
I think the long term change we would need is extremely high taxes as a
an explicit redistribution mechanism. We’ll look back and say, “during
Late State Capitalism we nearly ended the planet but then we manage to
curb inequality and raised inheritance tax to 80%, the max income tax
bracket to 90% and the two-digit million wealth tax to 20%.”
</p>
<p>
The goal would be a society with salaries between 50k and 200k per year
and family, and wealth worth one year of salary. Health insurance paid
for by taxes. Retirement homes paid for by taxes. Pensions paid for by
immediate redistribution (i.e., taxes) instead of investments.

<h2 id="us-not-moved-by-report-blaming-russia-for-havana-syndrome">US
not moved by report blaming Russia for ‘Havana Syndrome’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States is backing a year-old intelligence
assessment that health problems affecting, and in some cases
incapacitating, hundreds of American personnel around the world are not
the result of a weapon wielded by a U.S. adversary.</p>
<p>The White House, the Pentagon and the State Department Monday stood
by a March 2023 report by the National Intelligence Council that
concluded it is “very unlikely” the adverse symptoms known as Havana
Syndrome were caused by enemy operatives, despite a new investigation
that suggests a notorious Russian intelligence unit may be to blame.</p>
<p>“The intelligence community has not concluded that,” said White House
press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, defending the conclusions of the
2023 assessment.</p>
<p>But Jean-Pierre also said the White House has not stopped looking at
the issue, which in some cases has forced U.S. personnel to retire.</p>
<p>“We’ve taken this very seriously,” she said. “We are going to do
everything that we can … We’re going to continue to do a comprehensive
examination of the effects here that we’re seeing and the potential
causes.”</p>
<p>A joint investigation unveiled late Sunday by CBS’ “60 Minutes,”
Germany’s Der Spiegel and The Insider, found there is reason to believe
that the U.S. intelligence assessment came to the wrong conclusion.</p>
<p>Pointing to travel documents, mobile phone records, eyewitness
testimony and interviews with multiple U.S. officials and victims, the
news organizations concluded there is a high likelihood that Russia is
to blame.</p>
<p>Specifically, the investigation tied numerous reports of Havana
Syndrome with the presence of members of Unit 29155 of Russia’s military
intelligence service, known for its role in sabotage and
assassinations.</p>
<p>It also found that many of the symptoms are consistent with the
impact of sound or radio-frequency-based directed energy weapons.</p>
<p>Additionally, the investigation found members of GRU Unit 29155
received awards and promotions for their work on such weapons.</p>
<p>At the White House, Jean-Pierre referred additional questions about
Havana Syndrome to the U.S. Office of the Director of National
Intelligence (ODNI).</p>
<p>ODNI, the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency, or DIA, on Monday
all declined to respond to VOA’s request for comment.</p>
<p>But both ODNI and DIA pointed to the Worldwide Threat Assessment
issued by U.S. intelligence agencies last month.</p>
<p>“Most IC [intelligence community] agencies have concluded that it is
very unlikely a foreign adversary is responsible for the reported AHIs
[anomalous health incidents],” the assessment said, using the U.S.
government terminology for Havana Syndrome.</p>
<p>“IC agencies have varying confidence levels because we still have
gaps given the challenges collecting on foreign adversaries — as we do
on many issues involving them,” the assessment added, noting
intelligence analysts continue to monitor developments “in areas we have
identified as requiring additional research and analysis.”</p>
<p>U.S. officials have recorded about 1,500 cases of Havana Syndrome
since staff at the U.S. embassy in Havana, Cuba, first reported
unexplained illnesses in 2016. Victims in Cuba, Russia, China, Poland,
Austria and even the United States have reported a variety of symptoms,
including nausea and dizziness, debilitating headaches and memory
problems.</p>
<p>An initial investigation pointed to the possibility that at least
some of those suffering symptoms were impacted by some sort of weapon,
findings that were supported by a 2022 report by a panel of experts.</p>
<p>“Pulsed electromagnetic energy, particularly in the radiofrequency
range, plausibly explains the core characteristics,” the 2022 report
said.</p>
<p>But that same year, U.S. intelligence officials began backing off the
hypothesis that the mystery ailments were the result of a weapon. The
CIA, for example, said it appeared most of the cases could be
“reasonably explained” by medical conditions or environmental and
technical factors.</p>
<p>Russia on Monday rejected the conclusions of the investigation by
CBS’ “60 Minutes,” Germany’s Der Spiegel, and The Insider.</p>
<p>“This is nothing more than a groundless accusation,” Kremlin
spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by Russia’s TASS news
agency.</p>
<p>“This is not a new subject at all,” Peskov said. “From the very
beginning it was somehow tied to accusing the Russian side of it but
nobody has ever published or voiced any convincing support to these
unfounded accusations.”</p>
<p>Still, there have been reports of new cases.</p>
<p>The Pentagon Monday confirmed one of them, involving a U.S. defense
official who was struck with symptoms “similar to those reported in
anomalous health incidents” during a NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania
last July.</p>
<p>Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters the
individual was not part of the delegation attending the summit with
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.</p>
<p>“I’m not aware that the secretary’s delegation was at risk,” Singh
said, adding that Austin “has confidence in the intelligence
community.”</p>
<p>As for the possibility that Russian agents, or those working for
other U.S. adversaries, may be deploying a directed-energy weapon, “We’d
always be concerned,” Singh said.</p>
<p>“We’d always be concerned of any type of impact to our
servicemembers, to our civilians that causes health defects, health
impacts,” she said in response to a question from VOA.</p>
<p>State Department officials Monday said there would be no
repercussions for any employees speaking against the U.S. intelligence
findings and noted those affected by Havana Syndrome have been given
access to medical care and compensation through the HAVANA ACT, signed
into law in 2021.</p>
<p>“The safety and security of our personnel remains the top priority of
the secretary and we are doing everything possible to help those
affected,” said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.</p>

noises like the standard IONIQ 5 N.

I really hate the feeling when I am looking for an app to do something
and I can’t find a site that isn’t about the top 10 something or other.
And then, by chance, somebody mentions a good app on fedi and it’s
great. I guess I want to bring recommendation pages back.

Switzerland:
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.sbb.ch/en/travel-information/apps/sbb-mobile.html">SBB
Mobile</a> is for the train tables and for buying tickets online.
Basically a must-have if you don’t have a car.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/swisstopo-application">Swisstopo</a>
is for the Swiss maps, my the Swiss
<a href="https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/">Federal Office of
Topography</a>. ❤️
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.schweizmobil.ch/en/switzerlandmobility-app">SwitzerlandMobility</a>
is useful because it has the same official maps plus it interfaces with
the Swiss Tourism site so all the big hiking tours have descriptions and
pictures.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/about-us/get-our-app-and-stay-in-touch-with-switzerland/46766802">SWIplus</a>
is the alternative to visiting the
<a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/">swissinfo</a> site. No real benefit.
News for the Swiss abroad, or conversely, for the foreigners staring
back.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.srf.ch/hilfe/website-und-apps/srf-apps">SRF
News</a> is the alternative to visiting the
<a href="https://www.srf.ch/news">SRF News</a> site. No real benefit,
either. News
</p>
<p>
<a href="">Play SRF</a> is the alternative to visiting the national
<a href="https://www.srf.ch/play/tv">TV</a> or
<a href="https://www.srf.ch/programm/radio/">Radio</a> sites. Useful if
you want to look up older stuff. Or listen to an episode of Sounds!
without subscribing to the podcast.
</p>
<p>
In the same vein, there’s an app for
<a href="https://www.radioswissjazz.ch/">Swiss Jazz</a>,
<a href="https://www.radioswissclassic.ch/">Swiss Classic</a> and
<a href="https://www.radioswisspop.ch/">Swiss Pop</a> – digital radio
stations that just play music, by
<a href="https://www.srgssr.ch/en/our-offering">SRG SSR</a>. That is to
say, sponsored by the state.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/en/home/dokumentation/Swiss-Confederation-brief-guide.html">CH
info</a> is the alternative to visiting the
<a href="https://ch-info.swiss/">CH Info</a> site. No real benefit,
again. Learn the absolute basics about Switzerland’s political system,
administration and judicial authorities – i.e., the Federal
Administration.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/politik/abstimmungen/voteinfo.html">VoteInfo</a>
is the alternative to reading all the news about all the elections,
votes, referendums and initiatives, all in one place. Pretty interesting
every handful of months.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Compendium</strong> is the alternative to visiting the
<a href="https://compendium.ch/">Compendium</a> site. No real benefit, I
guess. Information about all the medication you can get in Switzerland.
I hope you don’t need it.

Travel
</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://osmand.net/">OsmAnd Maps Travel &amp; Navigate</a> is
the Open Street Map (OSM) app that lets me download maps for offline
use. Extremely useful for travelling abroad since Switzerland is not in
the European Union and therefore roaming is extremely expensive for us
and for foreigners in Switzerland… we need to be part of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_roaming_regulations">European
Union roaming regulations</a>. The user interface is complex with
different sets of settings depending on what you want to use the app
for, and so it can be endlessly confusing at first. My wife hates it.
Just be prepared for that.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.peakfinder.com/">PeakFinder</a> is an app to
identify mountain peaks. The older men here in Switzerland pride
themselves in knowing all the peaks and the app is my only way of
keeping up.

Now Accessible by EV</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
The
<a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/essays/tesla-electric-car-road-trip-test/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">closest</a>
I came to battery oblivion happened in Bryce Canyon City, Utah.
</p>
<p>
Up above 7,600 feet, the December evening temperatures dipped to 10
below zero Fahrenheit as I pulled my Tesla Model 3 into Ruby’s Inn.
Tesla’s website
<a href="https://www.tesla.com/findus?v=2&bounds=38.19842904988786%2C-109.53559460907805%2C36.713741243174944%2C-113.3560902145468&zoom=9&filters=destination%20charger&location=409164" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">listed</a>
the hotel as a place with destination chargers that could refill the
battery overnight. That guarantee did little good, since other EVs had
snagged the few working plugs by the time we arrived. My car’s remaining
range, suffering in the bitter cold, dropped below 20 miles as I scoured
the sprawling hotel campus for other EV hookups the receptionist had
marked on a paper map of the premises.
</p>
<p>
Finally, out in the middle of the snow, I saw the plug that was
promised: a post with a single 120-volt outlet meant for the RVs that
visit in sunnier months. My extension cord reached, barely. My battery
would live through the night.
</p>
<p>
If you drive an electric vehicle to see the eerie
<a href="https://www.nps.gov/brca/learn/nature/hoodoos.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hoodoos</a>
of Bryce Canyon National Park next year, you’ll have a far less anxious
time than I did. The area recently won a Tesla
<a href="https://www.tesla.com/supercharger-voting/overview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contest</a>
in which drivers could vote for future Supercharger locations. Its prize
was a promise that a fast-charging station would come to Bryce Canyon
City. Last Sunday, a
<a href="https://supercharge.info/changes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a>
that tracks permits and public records to discover the location of
future Superchargers indicated one will be built right there at Ruby’s
Inn, the site of my struggle.
</p>
<p>
Bryce isn’t alone. As charging stops fill in the map of the U.S., Tesla
is racing to build fast chargers near the remote National Parks of the
West. Because just about every automaker is starting to use Tesla’s NACS
plug, EVs of all sorts will be able to stop there. It’s about to become
realistic to visit some of America’s most jaw-dropping scenery in an
electric car.
</p>
<p>
When I started electric road-tripping in 2019 and 2020, only the
superstars of the National Park System were truly accessible. High-speed
charging stations existed in the tourist trap towns of Tusayan, Arizona,
and West Yellowstone, Montana, giving Tesla drivers access to the Grand
Canyon and to Yellowstone with little range anxiety. A site in Fish
Camp, California, provided enough electrons to gaze upon El Capitan in
Yosemite, while the baby Supercharger in Moab, Utah, powered you toward
the Delicate Arch trail. Parks that happened to be located near an
Interstate highway, like Petrified Forest and Zion, lay within reach for
an EV.
</p>
<p>
Yet striking out for America’s more isolated wonders was a dicey
proposition, one that relied upon hoping the slower chargers at hotels
and visitor’s centers would be operational and unoccupied. Let me tell
you: This is not a safe assumption.
</p>
<p>
To reach Crater Lake in 2022, we stayed 55 miles away in Klamath Falls,
site of the nearest Supercharger. I pulled into the gift shop near the
park’s entrance, hoping to add some safety juice for the day with the
available Level 2 destination charger, but it was busted. No matter.
Thanks to driving slowly around the lake and minding the speed limit
back to Klamath (through a cloud of
<a href="https://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/klamath_midge/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">specific
local midges</a> that entirely glazed the front of the car in gelatinous
bug guts), I completed the round trip back to the Supercharger station —
only to find that the busted charger I tried to tap earlier in the day
had bent a prong inside my Tesla port, rendering it unusable. We
happened to be in the parking lot of a Fred Meyer home store at the time
of this disastrous realization. In the moments before closing, I ran
inside and procured the necessary hand tool to bend my metal back into
shape. (<em>Note to readers: Do not do this.</em>) The DIY fix worked;
the trip was saved.
</p>
<p>
You won’t need to resort to such extreme measures, however, because
reliable and fast chargers are coming. Tesla has a
<a href="https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/supercharger-chemult-or-us-97-lucs-issued-12-15-23-8-v3.319914/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">permit</a>
to build a Supercharger at a highway junction within 25 miles of Crater
Lake, and given the park’s soaring popularity, that surely won’t be the
last. Nor will you need to retreat from the heart of Death Valley to
recharge in remote Beatty, Nevada because you couldn’t snag a plug at
the park’s luxury hotel (though if you do go to Beatty, get the BBQ at
Smokin’ J’s.). A Supercharger is coming to the closer town of
<a href="https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/supercharger-pahrump-nv.321630/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pahrump</a>,
and surely more are on their way.
</p>
<p>
Look at the
<a href="https://supercharge.info/map" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">map</a>
and you’ll see many more examples. The arid expanses of southeastern New
Mexico are charging desert now, but a planned Supercharger in Alamogordo
will send EV drivers on their way to White Sands. Terlingua, Texas will
provide a way to reach previously unreachable Big Bend along the Rio
Grande River. Kalispell, Montana; Ely, Nevada; and Vernal, Utah will
help electric drivers reach Glacier National Park, Great Basin National
Park, and Dinosaur National Monument, respectively. More sites may come
if the
<a href="https://www.electrifyamerica.com/locate-charger/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">third-party
charging companies</a> or the automakers
<a href="https://rivian.com/experience/charging#map" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">building
their own chargers</a> expand their offerings beyond the country’s most
well-traveled highways.
</p>
<p>
It is a cruel twist of fate that traveling to some of the planet’s most
majestic spots has, for so long, meant spewing carbon dioxide into its
atmosphere. National parks, monuments, and forests are, by their very
nature, far from population centers, and thus far from where most
charging infrastructure grew up in the early years of this EV era. The
treasures of the American West, especially, may be hours from the
freeway and hundreds of miles from the nearest big city.
</p>
<p>
At last, the proposition of zero-emissions driving to America’s best
idea is about to shift from fraught to ordinary. With longer driving
ranges in new EVs and new fast chargers available en route to the parks,
you won’t need to sit down with a map and a calculator, meticulously
charting a strategy to see
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_Island" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wizard
Island</a> without running out of miles. You’ll just pack the car and
go.

killer Alex Murdaugh gets 40 years for financial crimes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Alex Murdaugh, the South Carolina lawyer convicted in a
high-profile trial last year of murdering his wife and son, was
sentenced to 40 years in prison on Monday for financial crimes. </p>
<p>Murdaugh, 55, scion of an elite family of judges and attorneys, is
already serving a life sentence for the June 2021 murders of his wife,
Maggie, and son, Paul, 22, at the family hunting estate. </p>
<p>Murdaugh pleaded guilty last year to state charges of stealing
millions of dollars from clients of his prominent personal injury firm,
and was sentenced to 27 years in prison. </p>
<p>He was back in court on Monday for sentencing on federal charges of
conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud and money laundering. </p>
<p>District Judge Richard Gergel sentenced Murdaugh to 40 years in
prison, to be served concurrently with the 27 years he already
received. </p>
<p>Murdaugh pleaded guilty to the federal charges in September, at which
time U.S. Attorney Adair Boroughs said the disbarred lawyer’s “financial
crimes were extensive, brazen, and callous.” </p>
<p>“He stole indiscriminately from his clients, from his law firm, and
from others who trusted him,” Boroughs said. </p>
<p>Murdaugh’s televised three-week murder trial last year captivated
viewers nationwide and outside the country. </p>
<p>Evidence from his son’s cellphone indicated Murdaugh was the only
person with them at the estate’s dog kennels several minutes before
Maggie was killed with an assault rifle and Paul with a shotgun. </p>
<p>Murdaugh denied killing his wife and younger son, but admitted
stealing millions of dollars from clients of his law firm to feed an
opioid addiction. </p>
<p>Even before the trial finished, Netflix and HBO rushed out
docu-dramas on the case.</p>

opened for vessels clearing wreckage at Baltimore bridge collapse
site</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BALTIMORE — The U.S. Coast Guard has opened a temporary, alternate
channel for vessels involved in the clearing of debris at the site of
the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, part of a phased
approach to opening the main channel leading to the vital port,
officials said. </p>
<p>Crews are undertaking the complicated work of removing steel and
concrete at the site of the bridge’s deadly collapse into the Patapsco
River after a container ship lost power and crashed into a supporting
column. On Sunday, dive teams surveyed parts of the bridge and checked
the ship, and workers in lifts used torches to cut above-water parts of
the twisted steel superstructure. </p>
<p>Officials said the temporary channel is open only to vessels that are
helping with the cleanup effort. Authorities believe four workers
plunged to their deaths in the collapse. Recovery of their bodies is a
key part of the ongoing salvage operation. </p>
<p>Officials earlier said the channel would have a controlling depth of
11 feet (over 3 meters), a horizontal clearance of 264 feet (80 meters)
and a vertical clearance of 96 feet (29 meters). A video released Sunday
showed the Coast Guard dropping buoys in the water. </p>
<p>“This marks an important first step along the road to reopening the
port of Baltimore,” Capt. David O’Connell, the federal on-scene
coordinator of the response, said in a statement Monday. “By opening
this alternate route, we will support the flow of marine traffic into
Baltimore.” </p>
<p>On Monday, the Small Business Administration is opening a center in
Dundalk, Maryland, to help small businesses get loans to help them with
losses caused by the disruption of the bridge collapse. </p>
<p>And President Joe Biden will visit the site of the bridge collapse on
Friday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre announced Monday.
He will meet with state and local officials and get an “on-the-ground
look” at federal response efforts, Jean-Pierre said. </p>
<p>The bridge fell as the crew of the cargo ship Dali lost power and
control on March 26. They called in a mayday, which allowed just enough
time for police to stop vehicles from getting on the bridge, but not
enough time to get a crew of eight workers off the structure. </p>
<p>Two workers survived, two bodies were found in a submerged pickup,
and four more men are presumed dead. Weather conditions and the tangled
debris underwater have made it too dangerous for divers to search for
their bodies. </p>
<p>The Dali is managed by Synergy Marine Group and owned by Grace Ocean
Private Ltd. Danish shipping giant Maersk chartered the Dali, which was
on its way out of port when it lost power. </p>
<p>Along with clearing the shipping channel to reopen the port,
officials are trying to determine how to rebuild the major bridge, which
was completed in 1977. It carried Interstate 695 around southeast
Baltimore and became a symbol of the city’s working-class roots and
maritime culture. </p>
<p>Congress is expected to consider aid packages to help people who lose
jobs or businesses because of the prolonged closure of the Port of
Baltimore. The port handles more cars and farm equipment than any other
U.S. facility.</p>

<h2 id="a-deep-dive-into-email-deliverability-in-2024">A deep dive into
email deliverability in 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>On October 3, 2023, Google and Yahoo announced upcoming email
security standards to prevent spam, phishing and malware attempts.
Outlook.com (formerly Hotmail) is also enforcing these policies. With
the big 3 Email Service Providers (ESP) in agreement, expect widespread
adoption soon. Today’s threats are more complex than ever and more ESPs
will begin tightening the reigns. Failure to comply with these
guidelines will result in emails being blocked beginning April 2024. In
this article, we’re going to cover these guidelines and explain what
senders must do in order to achieve and maintain compliance. ↫ XOMedia
Some of these changes – most of them impact bulk senders and spammers –
should’ve been implemented ages ago, but seeing them being pushed by the
three major email providers, who all happened to be owned, of course, by
massive corporations, does raise quite a few red flags. Instinctively,
this makes me worried about ulterior motives, especially since running
your own email server is already fraught with issues due to the nebulous
ways Gmail treats emails coming from small servers. With the rising
interest in self-hosting and things like Mastodon, I hope we’re also
going to see a resurgence in hosting your own e-mail. I really don’t
like that all my email is going through Gmail – it’s what OSNews uses –
but I don’t feel like dealing with all the delivery issues people who
try self-hosting email lament about. With a possible renewed wave of
interest in it, we might be able to make the process easier and more
reliable.</p>

legislation to stop surprise medical bills worked?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
We’ve been taking a close look on this program at the burdens of medical
debt. Back in 2020, Congress passed the so-called “No Surprises Act” to
protect patients from unexpected big bills for out-of-network medical
care — and turns out, its wider impact on health care spending has
yielded mixed results. But first on the show, California’s new
$20-an-hour minimum wage for fast food goes into effect today. We’ll
unpack reactions.

introduced on March 21, so it’s been there a while. You have to
hard-reload the page to get the new version. So, when I post this on

the top of the list immediately. So a good use-case is to leave
Scripting News open with the blogroll visible and every once in a while
you may find something interesting to read. I like having it there, but
of course, it’s my baby, so that’s understandable. :-)</p>

<p>I tried
<a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/kara-swishers-tech-love-story/">listening</a>
to one of Kara Swisher’s interviews for her new book. The interviewer
was someone I respect, Brian Lehrer at WNYC. But he has an old and imho
unfair view that CraigsList and Facebook are responsible for the demise
of local news. I was surprised when he said as much near the start of
the interview. Then Swisher went into an obviously very well rehearsed
schpiel that confirmed that he was absolutely right and the tech gods
weren’t fooling anyone. OK that was my limit, I switched to another
podcast. She’s got a great business model. Tell the press what they want
to hear and you will get good press, pretty much guaranteed.</p>

to separate Teams and Office globally amid antitrust scrutiny</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft will sell its chat and video app Teams separately from its
Office product globally, the U.S. tech giant said on Monday, six months
after it unbundled the two products in Europe in a bid to avert a
possible EU antitrust fine. The European Commission has been
investigating Microsoft’s tying of Office and Teams since a 2020
complaint by Salesforce-owned competing workspace messaging app Slack. ↫
Foo Yun Chee at Reuters I honestly misread this as Microsoft selling
Teams off, which would’ve been far bigger news. Unbundling Teams from
Office globally is just Microsoft applying its recent European Union
policy to the rest of the world. All we need now is Microsoft to stop
trying to make Teams for families and friends happen, because nobody
will ever want to use Teams for anything, let alone personal use.</p>

<p>Every computer has at least one heart which beats the cadence to all
the other chips. The CloCK output pin is connected to a copper line
which spreads to most components, into their CLK input pin. If you are
mostly a software person like me, you may have never noticed it but all
kinds of processors have a CLK input pin. From CPUs (Motorola 68000,
Intel Pentium, MOS 6502), to custom graphic chips (Midway’s DMA2, Capcom
CPS-A/CPS-B, Sega’s Genesis VDP) to audio chips (Yamaha 2151, OKI
msm6295), they all have one. ↫ Fabien Sanglard I’ve watched enough
Adrian Black that I already knew all of this, and I’m assuming so did
many of you. But hey, I’ll never pass up the opportunity to link to the

Environmental experts are concerned that the ongoing removal of wreckage

have deployed nearly a mile’s worth of protective and absorbent barriers
into the water, the

<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/officials-baltimore-harbor-spill-not-an-immediate-threat/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said
Friday</a> that “no immediate threat to the environment” had been
identified. The cargo ship that struck the bridge was carrying at least
56 containers with hazardous materials, 14 of which were destroyed. A
breach of the ship’s hull at any point during the cleanup process could

would authorize the state to determine the cost it has borne from the
extraction and combustion of fossil fuels over the past three decades
and then ask responsible parties to pay up. (Vermont plans to focus its
efforts on the world’s biggest emitters.) Modeled after federal
Superfund law that keeps companies on the hook for cleaning up
contamination, Vermont’s bill and others like it face an uncertain
future and inevitable legal challenges.

Heat waves are moving slower, traveling farther, and lasting longer, a
<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adl1598" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new
study</a> found. Scientists have known for a long time that climate
change is exacerbating heat waves, but the new study, published Friday
in the journal <em>Science Advances</em>, determined that heat waves’
movement has slowed by 20% since 1979 — a decline of about 5 miles per
day each decade. They’ve also gotten longer and more frequent. Wei
Zhang, a climate scientist at Utah State University and one of the
study’s authors, is particularly concerned about the effects of
prolonged heat waves on urban areas. “If those heat waves last in the
city for much longer than before, that would cause a very dangerous
situation,” Zhang

<p class="drop-caps">
For those living near the Port of Baltimore, the transportation and
storage of coal on its way from mines in the Appalachian Mountains to
far-flung foreign kilns is “a mundane but ever-present imposition,”
Chloe Ahmann, a Cornell University anthropologist, told me. Ahmann once
worked as an elementary school teacher in Curtis Bay, a residential
neighborhood adjacent to the working port, and wrote a book on the
area’s
<a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/F/bo215474590.html" target="_blank">post-industrial
present</a>.

<p>
“There are stories going back generation,” she said. “Coal dust covering
everything in the neighborhood — bicycles, porches, windowsill. People
wipe coal dust off their windows as a daily ritual.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
With the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge and subsequent
shutdown of the port, that coal now has nowhere to go for the
foreseeable future. Baltimoreans don’t want it, but its intended
recipients thousands of miles away in India most certainly
do.<br/><br/>“The top recipient of U.S. steam coal shipped from
Baltimore by far over the past five years has been India, where the
brick manufacturing industry has been a major customer,” the U.S. Energy
Information Administration said in a
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61663" target="_blank">report</a>
on the impacts of the bridge disaster. In January alone, the Port of
Baltimore exported almost a million tons of coal to India, up almost
three-fold from January of last year,
<a href="https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2551775-stuck-baltimore-coal-may-raise-prices-in-india-europe" target="_blank">according
to Argus</a>, a commodity data provider. In total, 17 million tons of
thermal coal — the type used in power plants and brick kilns — left the
U.S. via Baltimore in 2023, S&amp;P Global

by analyzing Census Bureau data.
</p>
<p>
India is the world’s
<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/coal-2023/demand" target="_blank">second
largest consumer of coal</a> after China, and coal accounts for over 70%
of India’s emissions from burning fuel, according to the International
Energy Agency. (In contrast,
<a href="https://www.iea.org/countries/united-states/emissions" target="_blank">coal
accounts for a fifth of the United States’ emissions from
combustion</a>.) About a quarter of India’s emissions come from
industry, much of which uses coal in its processes, including
steelmaking, and cement and, yes, brick manufacturing.<br/>

Brickmaking in India is often done on small scales by local producers,
but even so, its energy consumption is “comparable to the organized
construction industries such as cement and steel,” according to research
published in <em>Nature India</em>. Many of those bricks are used to
build homes, part and parcel of the country’s astounding economic
growth. Along with its steel and cement industries, brickmaking has
transformed India —
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-per-capita-worldbank?tab=table" target="_blank">whose
inflation-adjusted per capita GDP of around $1,800</a> in 1990 would
have made it one of the world’s poorest countries today — into the
third-largest carbon dioxide emitter in the world.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>The same brick industry that produces the literal building
blocks of India’s homebuilding sector is also responsible for immensely
damaging particulate pollution. The combination of coal and biomass used
to fire brick kilns is responsible for around
<a href="https://www.ccacoalition.org/projects/improving-worker-skills-transform-indias-brick-sector#:~:text=Brick%20kilns%20emit%20approximately%2066,and%20sulfur%20dioxide%20air%20pollution." target="_blank">75
million tons of carbon dioxide emissions</a> — comparable to the total
emissions of Washington State, Arizona, or the 2021 California wildfires
— and 100,000 tons of black carbon emissions, according to the Climate
and Clean Air Coalition.

<p>
Air pollution in South Asia is one of the largest public health problems
in the world. India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh all ranked in the
<a href="https://epi.yale.edu/epi-results/2022/component/air" target="_blank">bottom
10 of 180 countries</a> for air quality, according to the Yale
University Environmental Performance Index. In 2019, air pollution was
estimated to account for

1.7 million premature deaths</a> in India. “Brick kilns, involving the
burning of low-grade coal, are one of the major sectors that contribute
to air pollution in South Asia,” a

Bank report said</a>, with the brick industry making up over 90% of
particulate emissions in some South Asian cities and 15% of the most
dangerous small particulate emissions in Delhi.<del></del>
</p>
<p>
In a story that will be familiar to much of industrial and
post-industrial America, these industrial processes are both an
important economic engine and an obvious detriment to health locally and
are contributing to the climatic changes that are already having
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/06/india/extreme-heat-india-climate-ac-intl-hnk/index.html#:~:text=Rising%20heat&text=And%20the%20country's%20more%20tropical,Weather%20and%20Climate%20Extremes%20journal." target="_blank">devastating
effects in South Asia</a>. Efforts to regulate the brick industry have
already run into complaints that efficiency requirements will be
<a href="https://www.newslaundry.com/2024/01/16/indias-brick-kiln-workers-fear-loss-of-livelihood-to-green-alternatives" target="_blank">too
expensive for cash-strapped businesses</a> and will result in lower
employment in the sector.
</p>
<p>
In the vertiginous world of globalized capitalism, different regions
using the same resource — the Appalachian coal mines, the Baltimore
port, and the Indian brick manufacturers — can all at the same time be
at different stages of industrialization and post-industrialization,
with differing attitudes toward the coal that powers and pollutes them.
In South Baltimore, the people living with the dust from the coal pier
no longer sees any positive relationship between industrial activity and
their own well-being, Ahmann told me.
</p>
<p>
The Baltimore and Ohio railroad, which has been part of the rail
conglomerate CSX since 1980, began construction in 1827 and has long
shipped coal from West Virginia and other Appalachian states to the East
Coast. Baltimore’s Curtis Bay neighborhood, where Ahmann lived, is
adjacent to a coal pier operated by CSX. “It’s an iconic local scene,
right by a local playground, stone throw from several elementary schools
and homes,” Ahmann said, making the neighborhood both “heavily
industrialized and very much a lived-in place.”
</p>
<p>
While the Maryland government trumpets direct and indirect employment at
the port of around
<a href="https://mpa.maryland.gov/Pages/executive-director.aspx" target="_blank">15,000
people</a>, that’s about half the number that worked there in 1970.
</p>
<p>
“It’s no longer the case that industry is a major employer in South
Baltimore,” Ahmann said. “It’s not like it was 40 years ago, when
everybody knew somebody whose livelihood was attached to industrial
production in this place.” Instead, people in the area “cobble together
lives from low-wage service jobs,” she said. Overall, manufacturing
employment in Maryland has been roughly
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MDMFG" target="_blank">cut
in half since 1990</a>.
</p>
<p>
In late 2021, a CSX coal facility in Curtis Bay exploded,
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/baltimore/news/baltimore-councilwoman-to-seek-suspension-of-operations-at-csx-curtis-bay-coal-terminal/" target="_blank">damaging
nearby homes</a> and spreading tremors for miles. Following the blast, a
coalition of community groups and the Maryland Department of the
Environment investigated particulate pollution in Curtis Bay and found
coal dust “present throughout the community,” with coal dust coming from
the terminal itself, as well as train and truck traffic.
</p>
<p>
“We should not have open air coal piers period, and certainly not in a
residential area behind a playground,” Ahmann said.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Among the many fears locals are nursing as the Key Bridge
lies in ruins is that the coal will simply pile up at the port as long
as it remains blocked. “These piles are going to grow every day,” Ahmann
told me, describing it as “stark visual evidence of the untenability of
this situation.”

Pino now has all-new chainplates! We removed the original ones earlier
this month to inspect them and found some pit corrosion(as well as a
small crack), replacing them was necessary. With the chainplates gone,
we removed the entire starboard side cabinet to see what was behind
it—it’s always nice to see parts of our boat we’ve never seen. We also
replaced 3 old halyards on Pino. Devine earned themself a couple of

I’m sitting here, watching my dog walking up and down, destroying all the sticks that are lying on the ground. It’s a chilled morning.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Anyway, I’m sitting here, typing this on my phone. I have my phone with
me. I shouldn’t. I should have a book with me. But it’s raining. And
books don’t go along well with rain.
</p>
<p>
Books are interesting objects. The entire consumption process of a book
is interesting, especially when compared to websites. There’s no
equivalent of the web for books. There’s no place where an infinite
supply of books is available to you at virtually no cost. Reading a book
involves some decision-making and, more often than not, some financial
investment.
</p>
<p>
Sure, some of you are probably saying that libraries are the equivalent
of the web for books but that’s not the same thing. And don’t get me
wrong, libraries are great!
</p>
<p>
Reflecting on books made me think about what the web would look like if
it was some sort of pay-per-scroll platform. Not a place where virtually
everything is free but a place where everything has to be purchased in
order to be consumed. Which sites would I be willing to pay for? I’m
going to ignore the obvious answers because I’m sure almost everyone
would have sites like Wikipedia or YouTube. Those are boring answers.
Aggregators such as Hacker News or Reddit would also not be something
I’d be interested in paying for because the actual content lives
somewhere else. So I’d be paying just for the commentary.
</p>
<p>
In my case, I’d probably pay for two types of websites: either personal
sites of people that do things I enjoy or that have interesting takes on
the world or sites that collect content coming from a diverse group of
people (<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com">LessWrong</a> is a good
example).
</p>
<p>
Would I be happy if the web was some sort of à la carte menu rather than
a free buffet? I’d say no. Still, thinking about this made me
realize—once again—that my media diet is something that I have to always
keep in mind. It also reminded me that I’m not reading enough books!

<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog</p>
<p>On Wednesday, President Joe Biden issued an executive order
instructing the National Park Service to “highlight important figures
and chapters in women’s history.” “Women and girls of all backgrounds
have shaped our country’s history, from the ongoing fight for justice
and equality to cutting-edge scientific advancements and artistic
achievements,” the announcement read. “Yet these contributions have
often been overlooked. We must do more to recognize the role of women
and girls in America’s story, including through the Federal Government’s
recognition and interpretation of historic and cultural sites.”</p>

bridge collapse, Maryland governor urges Congress to pass funding for
rebuild</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — With efforts underway to clean up thousands of tons of
steel debris from the collapsed bridge in Baltimore’s harbor, Maryland
Governor Wes Moore on Sunday urged Republicans to work with Democrats to
approve the</p>
<p>federal funding needed for rebuilding the bridge and to get the port
economy back on its feet.</p>
<p>Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key bridge collapsed early on Tuesday
morning, killing six road workers, when a container ship nearly the size
of the Eiffel Tower lost power and crashed into a support pylon. Much of
the span crashed into the Patapsco River, blocking the Port of
Baltimore’s shipping channel.</p>
<p>The Biden administration released $60 million in initial emergency
aid on Thursday to assist in cleaning up the bridge debris and reopening
the port, which is the largest in the U.S. for “roll-on, roll-off”
vehicle imports and exports of farm and construction equipment. The port
has been closed since Tuesday, leaving in limbo the jobs of some 15,000
people who rely on its daily operations.</p>
<p>Federal officials have told Maryland lawmakers the final cost of
rebuilding the bridge could soar to at least $2 billion, Roll Call
reported, citing a source familiar with the</p>
<p>Discussions.</p>
<p>Democratic President Joe Biden has pledged that the federal
government will cover the cost, but that will depend on passage of
legislation authorizing the funds by both the Republican-led House of
Representatives and Democratic-led Senate. The divided</p>
<p>Congress has been repeatedly riven by partisan battles over funding,
with hardline Republicans often at odds even with members of their own
party.</p>
<p>Moore, a Democrat, said Republicans should be willing to approve the
funding for the sake of not just the city of Baltimore, but for the
national economy.</p>
<p>“The reason that we need people to move in a bipartisan basis … is
not because we need you to do Maryland a favor,” Moore told CNN on
Sunday. “We need to make sure that we’re actually moving quickly to get
the American economy going again, because the Port of Baltimore is
instrumental in our larger economic growth.”</p>
<p>Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg expressed optimism on
Sunday that Congress would approve the funds necessary for the cleanup
and rebuild, noting that the divided legislative body had passed Biden’s
$1 trillion infrastructure package in 2021.</p>
<p>“If there’s anything left in this country that is more bipartisan
than infrastructure, it should be emergency response.</p>
<p>This is both, and I hope that Congress will be willing if and when we
turn to them,” Buttigieg told CBS’s “Face the Nation.”</p>
<p>Biden was expected to visit the bridge collapse site this week.</p>
<p>An enormous crane began cutting up portions of the collapsed bridge
to prepare them for removal on Saturday, which officials said was the
first step of what will be a long and complicated cleanup. A
spokesperson for the governor’s office said on Sunday that a 180-metric
ton (200-ton) piece of the bridge had been removed and officials were
working to determine the best strategy for pulling the ship off the
wreckage.</p>
<p>Later Sunday officials said they were preparing to establish an
alternate route for “commercially essential vessels,” although few
additional details were released and the timing of the alternate route’s
opening wasn’t made clear.</p>
<p>In a statement, coordinator Capt. David O’Connell said that the
alternate would “support the flow of marine traffic into Baltimore.”
Video released by responders showed Coast Guard officials dropping buoys
into the water near the site of the collision.</p>
<p>The wreckage and hazardous weather conditions have made it impossible
for divers to continue searching for the four remaining bodies of the
deceased construction workers in recent days, Moore said.</p>
<p>Moore and other officials have declined to give an estimated timeline
for the reopening of the port and the rebuilding of the bridge.</p>

<h2 id="ora2pg-24.3-have-been-released">Ora2Pg 24.3 have been
released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
Bangkok, Thailand - March 29th, 2024
</p>
<h2>
Ora2Pg
</h2>
<p>
Version 24.3 of Ora2Pg, a free and reliable tool used to migrate an
Oracle database to PostgreSQL, has been officially released and is
publicly available for download.
</p>
<p>
This release fixes several issues reported since last release and
especially a regression in GEOMETRY data export. As usual, it also adds
some new features and improvements.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Add new configuration directive <code>ORACLE_FDW_PREFETCH</code> to
control the “prefetch” used by oracle_fdw COPY/INSERT. Prior to this
change Ora2Pg uses the default “prefetch” of oracle_fdw, which at the
time of writing is 50. Allowing this to be controlled by an Ora2Pg
configuration/option gives the option of increased performance at the
cost of some additional memory on the PostgreSQL side.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Add new configuration directive <code>PGTT_NOSUPERUSER</code>. By
default the pgtt extension is loaded using the superuser privilege when
<code>EXPORT_GTT</code> is activated. Enabled it if you run the SQL
scripts generated using a non superuser user. It will use: <code>LOAD
‘$libdir/plugins/pgtt’;</code> instead of <code>LOAD ‘pgtt’;</code>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Backward compatibility changes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Modify the behavior of triggers export with <code>EXPORT_INVALID</code>.
It used to apply to <code>ENABLED</code> or <code>DISABLED</code>
triggers instead of real <code>VALID</code> or <code>INVALID</code>
triggers. Export of invalid triggers will be controlled by
<code>EXPORT_INVALID</code> like others objects like functions,
packages, etc. This mean that disabled triggers that are valid will be
exported by default now, this was not the case before.
</li>
</ul>
