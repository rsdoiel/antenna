## Fed's actions spoke louder than words in inflation fight, research shows

date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA

JACKSON HOLE, Wyoming — The Federal Reserve's credibility in the eyes of financial markets helped in its battle against inflation over the past two years, but it had to be earned afresh with interest rate hikes that backed up policymakers' verbal promises to restore price stability, according to new research presented at the Kansas City Fed's annual research conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.


A strong perception in financial markets that a central bank is committed to inflation control can make monetary policy more effective, prompting markets to shift financial conditions faster and lowering inflation with a less-serious hit to economic growth than would otherwise be the case.


While investors came to believe that the U.S. central bank under the leadership of Fed Chair Jerome Powell was serious about defending its 2% inflation target, that belief only formed over time and after the officials began raising the policy interest rate in March 2022 and accelerated the rate hikes over that summer, the researchers found.


"Forecasters and markets were highly uncertain about the monetary policy rule prior to 'liftoff' and learned about it from the Fed's rate hikes," economists Michael Bauer from the San Francisco Fed, Carolin Pflueger from the University of Chicago, and Adi Sunderam from the Harvard Business School, found in their research. "Substantial rate hikes were apparently necessary for perceptions to shift. ... The public did not fully understand the Fed's strategy and policy rule prior to liftoff."


The research serves as a warning of sorts against central bankers putting too much weight on the power of "talk therapy" — or the ability to influence economic outcomes with words and promises alone.


Earning public trust


The Fed in recent years has been characterized by a surfeit of speeches and public comments by its officials, whether by the head of the central bank, other members of its presidentially appointed Board of Governors, or its 12 regional bank presidents, under the notion that more transparency is good for public accountability and makes policy more effective.


Fed officials in the recent inflation battle often noted that public belief in their commitment to the inflation target would help on its own to lower the pace of price increases, shorten the time it took for tighter monetary policy to have an impact, and lower inflation with less damage to the job market and other aspects of the "real" economy.


The researchers found, however, that while the Fed under Powell eventually earned the benefit of public trust, it also wasn't a given.


The research used survey data to quantify how professional forecasters perceived the Fed would respond to higher inflation and found that even as prices began rising in 2021 the expected Fed response to inflation was near zero.


While that could have been attributed to several factors, including a belief that inflation would ease on its own, the researchers concluded it was because forecasters weren't sure how the central bank would react.


After the first rate increase in March of 2022, however, perceptions began to shift, with forecasters eventually expecting the Fed to respond on an almost one-for-one basis to any rise in inflation.


The change in perceptions coincided with policymakers shifting from the initial quarter-percentage-point move to the first of four 75-basis-point hikes in June 2022, and with a stern speech by Powell at that year's Jackson Hole conference that reaffirmed his intent to defend the inflation target despite the economic pain it might cause.


As market perceptions about the Fed's sensitivity to inflation increased, "interest rates became significantly more sensitive to inflation data surprises," the research found, adding that "the increase in the perceived inflation response likely aided the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy and improved the Fed's inflation-unemployment tradeoff."


For future policymakers, the researchers said, the conclusion is clear: Actions speak louder than words.


"Policy rate actions contribute to, and may even be necessary for, the effectiveness of communication, particularly when uncertainty about the monetary policy framework is high," they found, suggesting the Fed's quarterly Summary of Economic Projections could be changed to make the central bank's "reaction function" more explicit. "A timely policy rate response to inflation matters not only for influencing immediate financial conditions, but also for signaling that policymakers are serious."

## Thoughts on a new image for the fediverse

<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>This <a href="https://symbol.fediverse.info/">proposed image for the fediverse</a> is good; I like it a lot.</p><p>But I don't know that the combative language on this site is helpful. The Meta iconography isn't right, I agree, but there's something off about calling them “a large corporation that is joining in as late” (sic).</p><p>For one thing, Meta is early; for another, it seems to me that we want companies to participate? I don’t think seeking ideological purity is useful (and run the risks of the movement shooting itself in the foot).</p><p>Whatever you think about Meta’s goals for participating, I do also think Meta’s presence gives the network a sort of legitimacy that it was otherwise struggling to achieve. That’s a net benefit: we must grow the network.</p><p>I also agree with <a href="https://www.manton.org/2024/08/24/i-like-the.html">the point</a>, made by Chris Messina, Manton Reece and others, that the right phrase is <em>the social web</em>, not the fediverse.

## Babe Ruth's 'called shot' jersey could auction for $30 million

date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA

DALLAS, Texas — Nearly a century after Babe Ruth called his shot during the 1932 World Series, the jersey worn by the New York Yankees slugger when he hit the home run to center field could sell at auction for as much as $30 million.


Heritage Auctions is offering up the jersey Saturday night in Dallas.


Ruth's famed, debated and often imitated “called shot” came as the Yankees and Chicago Cubs faced off in Game 3 of the World Series at Chicago's Wrigley Field on October 1, 1932. In the fifth inning, Ruth made a pointing gesture while at bat and then hit a home run off Cubs pitcher Charlie Root.


The Yankees won the game 7-5 and swept the Cubs the next day to win the series.


That was Ruth's last World Series, and the “called shot” was his last home run in a World Series, said Mike Provenzale, the production manager for Heritage’s sports department.


“When you can tie an item like that to an important figure and their most important moment, that’s what collectors are really looking for,” Provenzale said.


Heritage said Ruth gave the road jersey to one of his golfing buddies in Florida around 1940 and it remained in that family for decades. Then, in the early 1990s, that man's daughter sold it to a collector. It was then sold at auction in 2005 for $940,000, and that buyer consigned it to Heritage this year.


In 2019, one of Ruth's road jerseys dating to 1928-30 sold for $5.64 million in an auction conducted at Yankee Stadium. That jersey was part of a collection of items that Ruth’s family had put up for sale.

## Canadian rail arbitration hearing ends without decision; strike looms

date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA

TORONTO — A workers’ union Friday threatened a strike at one of Canada’s two major freight railroads, only hours after the company’s trains restarted following a potentially devastating stoppage. A government-ordered arbitration hearing wrapped up without a decision, and Canadian National trains were expected to keep moving at least through Monday morning.


CN and Canadian Pacific Kansas City Ltd. locked out their workers Thursday when negotiations over a new labor contract reached a deadline without an agreement. That resulted in a near total shutdown of freight rail in the country for more than a day, until Canadian National resumed its service Friday morning. Trains operated by CPKC remain parked, and its workers, who had already been on strike since Thursday, stayed on the picket line Friday.


The government forced the companies and the union, Teamsters Canada Rail Conference, into arbitration overseen by the Canada Industrial Relations Board — an order the union is challenging. Friday's nine-hour hearing ended with no order from the board.


The union filed a 72-hour strike notice against CN on Friday morning shortly after it announced that it planned to challenge the arbitration order, union spokesperson Marc-Andre Gauthier said.


If the board orders the union back to work, “the TCRC will lawfully abide by the decision, but will undertake steps to challenge to the fullest extent," the Teamsters said in a statement. “Unfortunately, this will not provide immediate relief, but the Union is prepared to appeal to federal court if necessary.”


Canadian National, which has about 6,500 workers involved in the dispute, said the impact of the strike notice will depend on the timing of the Canada Industrial Relations Board's decision. “It is in the national interest of Canada that the CIRB rule quickly, before even more harm is caused,” the railroad said in a written statement. CPKC has about 3,000 engineers, conductors and dispatchers involved.


Perrin Beatty, president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said the union's latest actions "will prolong the damage to our economy and jeopardize the wellbeing and livelihoods of Canadians, including union and nonunion workers across multiple industries.”


Labor Minister Steven MacKinnon announced the decision to force the parties into binding arbitration Thursday afternoon, more than 16 hours after the lockout shut down the railroads, saying the economic risk was too great to allow them to continue. The government had declined to order arbitration two weeks ago. MacKinnon said he had hoped that negotiations between the companies and the union on a new contract would succeed.


“This is not about disobeying the minister’s order. It’s about exercising our right,” Teamsters Canada President Francois Laporte said Friday in announcing the strike. “We will exercise our right within the legal framework."


Canadian National trains had begun rolling at 7 a.m. across Canada, said CN spokesperson Jonathan Abecassis. The development initially appeared to at least partially end a work stoppage that threatened to wreak havoc on the economies of Canada and the United States. Both countries, across all industries, rely on railroads to deliver their raw materials and finished products.


“While CN is focused on its recovery plan and powering the economy, Teamsters are focused on getting back to the picket line and holding the North American economy hostage to their demands,” Abecassis said following the union’s strike notice.


Getting even one of the railroads running again is a relief for businesses. In most past rail labor disputes, only one of the Canadian railroads stopped and the economy was able to weather that disruption.


The negotiations that began last year are hung up on issues around the way workers are scheduled and contract rules designed to prevent fatigue. The railroads had proposed shifting away from the current system that pays workers based on the number of miles they travel, to a system based on the hours they work. The railroads said the switch would make it easier to provide predictable schedules. But the union resisted because it feared the proposed changes would erode hard-fought protections against fatigue and jeopardize safety.


In Canada, another issue at CN is the railroad's intention to expand a system that allows it to temporarily relocate workers to other parts of its network when it's short on employees in a certain region.


Regarding wages, the railroads said they both offered raises in line with other recent deals in the industry for what are already well-paying jobs. Canadian National has said its engineers make about $150,000 and conductors earn roughly $121,000 for working 160 days a year, although some of their time off is spent stuck at hotels on the road between train trips while getting required rest. CPKC says its pay is comparable.


Nearly all of Canada’s freight handled by rail — worth more than $730 million a day and adding up to more than 375 million tons of freight last year — stopped Thursday along with rail shipments crossing the U.S. border.


About 30,000 commuters in Canada were also affected because their trains use CPKC’s lines. CPKC and CN’s trains continued operating in the U.S. and Mexico during the lockout.


Billions of dollars of goods move between Canada and the U.S. via rail each month, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.


“There are a lot of goods and services shipped across borders," Sean O’Brien, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said at a rally in Calgary, Alberta, on Friday. "If this company chooses to continue its bad behavior, then it is going to have an impact. ... They’ve got a lot of decisions they need to make. And they need to make the most important decision: Reward these workers with what they’ve earned and don’t try to diminish safety just so they need to feed their bottom lines.”

## Hone approaches Hawaii; Big Island under tropical storm warning

date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA

HONOLULU, HAWAII — Tropical Storm Hone was approaching the southern edges of Hawaii on Saturday with gusts of wind and heavy rain, potentially inflicting flooding and wind damage on the Big Island over the weekend and raising the risk of wildfires on the drier sides of the islands.


The National Weather Service has issued a tropical storm warning for Hawaii County, which includes all of the Big Island, and a red flag warning for the leeward sides of all islands.


Hone, which means “sweet and soft” in Hawaiian, had top winds of 105 kilometers per hour (65 miles per hour) early Saturday. It will likely strengthen into a Category 1 hurricane as it passes near or south of the Big Island from Saturday night into early Sunday, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami.


The Hawaii Tourism Authority told travelers it's still safe to come to the islands but recommended that people postpone outdoor activities.


“We are not advising visitors to cancel their trips,” the agency said in a news release.


Hone was centered 465 kilometers (290 miles) east-southeast of Hilo and 805 kilometers (500 miles) east-southeast of Honolulu early Saturday.


The eastern and southeastern parts of the Big Island could get 11 to 25 centimeters (5 to 10 inches) of rain. The island could get sustained winds of 32 to 64 kph (20 to 40 mph) and gusts near 97 kph (60 mph).


The dry air north of the storm will spread arid conditions across the archipelago on Saturday, combining with strong winds to raise wildfire risks. Most of the state is already abnormally dry or in drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.


The weather service's red flag warning will be in effect from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday. It issues the alert when warm temperatures, very low humidity and stronger winds combine to raise fire dangers. Winds are expected to be strongest where they blow downslope from higher terrain, over headlands and through passes, the hurricane center advised.


The situation recalls last year's deadly wildfires on Maui, which were fueled by hurricane-force winds. But Hone's wildfire risks are lower, said Laura Farris, a weather service meteorologist in Honolulu.


The August 8, 2023, blaze that torched the historic town of Lahaina caused the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century. Powerful winds whipped up in part by a hurricane passing to Hawaii's south helped fuel the flames that killed 102 people. Dry, overgrown grasses and drought helped spread the fire.


The state's two power companies, Hawaiian Electric and the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative, said they would be monitoring conditions this weekend and ready to shut off power if necessary to reduce the chance that live, damaged powerlines could start fires.


The cause of the Lahaina blaze is still under investigation, but it’s possible it was ignited by bare electrical wire and leaning power poles toppled by the strong winds.


Moving westward across the Pacific behind Hone was Category 2 Hurricane Gilma, but it was expected to weaken over cooler waters as it encounters drier air in coming days and was forecast to become a tropical depression by Wednesday. Gilma may bring rain to Hawaii, but it's not clear how much, Farris said.

## They don’t make ’em like that any more: Borland Turbo Pascal 7

date: 2024-08-24, from: OS News

All, in all, It was much easier to program for Windows using Turbo Pascal 7 than with anything else. Not only did it provide a programming model that matched the way the Windows user interface worked, the application itself had a Windows graphical interface – many Windows programming tools at that time actually ran under MSDOS, and were entirely text-based. TP 7 also had fully-graphical tools for designing the user interface elements, like menus and icons. Laying out a menu using a definition file with an obscure format, using Windows Notepad, was never an agreeable experience. Microsoft did produce graphical tools for this kind of operation, but Turbo Pascal combined them into a seamless IDE. All I had to do to build and run my programs was to hit the F7 key. I could even set breakpoints for the debugger, just by clicking a line of code. As I said, common enough today, but revolutionary for early Windows programming. ↫ Kevin Boone Even as a mere child who didn&#8217;t even know what programming was, I was aware of Turbo Pascal. It was a name that you just encountered all over the place as a DOS and Windows 3.x user, even if you didn&#8217;t know what it was. The author of this article, Kevin Boone, even claims Turbo Pascal &#8220;contributed to the widespread uptake, and eventual domination, of Microsoft Windows on desktop PCs&#8221;, which is not something I can verify because I was far too young, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it holds water. This article made me wonder if Pascal is easy to learn, and if someone wanting to learn programming can do worse than start with a Windows 3.x virtual machine and Turbo Pascal. Sure, it&#8217;s probably not very relevant today, but it might serve as a good, solid base to work from? I have no idea.

## Ethernet history deepdive: why do we have different frame types?

date: 2024-08-24, from: OS News

The history of Ethernet is fascinating. The reason why we have three different frame types is that DIX used the Ethernet II frame that is prevalent today, while IEEE intended to use a different frame format that could be used for different MAC layers, such as token bus, token ring, FDDI, and so on. The IEEE were also inspired by HDLC, and modeled their frame header more in alignment with the OSI reference model that had the concept of SAPs. When they discovered that the number of available SAPs weren’t enough, they made an addition to the 802 standard to support SNAP frames. In networks today, Ethernet II is dominant, but some control protocols may use LLC and/or SNAP frames. ↫ Daniel Dib I just smiled and nodded.

I work in the audio description space as a writer and Blind Quality Control specialist/editor, but I also write fiction podcast scripts as well as novellas and novels. I publish books, and I'm a vibrant advocate for digital accessibility with regards to blind access.</p>
<p>My main love is writing. I love writing fiction stories because I believe it's the best kind of education.</p>
<p>As for the types of fiction I write, I write romance. Diverse romance, specifically. I've dabbled in erotica, but my work leans more towards the romance side of the coin with not a lot of smut. I do write about people like me, awkward, but empathetic people and their love journeys. Others have also said I'm a great humor writer, but I don't consider myself gut busting funny, but others would disagree!</p>
<p>Lastly, I write screenplays and TV show seasons, but my main writing love has always been writing romance books and novellas and fiction podcast scripts.</p>
<p>I'm also an accessibility consultant. Trust me, I don't love the accessibility consulting, but I'm passionate about accessibility and accessible design because it's how I can access the web.</p>
<p>As for my hobbies? I read a lot of books, consume a lot of fiction podcasts, and eat a lot of cookies. I'm a digital nomad so I work entirely remotely.</p>
<h2>What's the story behind your blog?</h2>
<p>I knew that I always wanted my own website. I didn't want to be beholden to any tech corporation hosting my content, let alone censor me because people find sex gross but somehow find hateful opinions to be just fine and dandy. My blog is all over the place. Blind readers will get tutorials on how to use something with a screen reader. Publishing people will get thoughts and opinions about disability representation in the industry and the media published by various publishers. Other people will find snapshots of experiences and how I feel about them. My blog isn't one thing. It's a mix mash of things.</p>
<p>I always wanted a space of my own to just dump thoughts and stories and otherwise onto the internet without having a corporation control what I can say or who sees it. With an RSS feed, my writings aren't controlled by an algorithm or someone paying to drown out my post with their latest sponsored content.</p>
<p>I didn't like where WordPress was headed with their Gutenberg editor at all, so I went looking for a static site generator I could use. I know how to read code, and I know how to write in some internet languages, but I really didn't want to host my own site. I wanted to pay someone to host my stuff but also let me to exact control sometimes. Also, I needed a platform that was going to be screen reader accessible from the beginning. Very few publishing platforms are screen reader accessible, so my options are limited, but I didn't want to do Micro Blogging. I like writing long content because lengthy writing lends itself to more introspection and thought.</p>
<p>I knew I didn't want to narrow down my blog to a particular theme. I knew it was going to be me. It was going to be a platform to promote my work, for me to tell stories, and for me to talk to other people. I finally found a web host that was willing to host my blog for a fee.</p>
<h2>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</h2>
<p>If I am doing a nonfiction piece, I gather up all links and references in a text editor and just keep a running list of references and links until I'm done with that post. I write to old boy bands like Simple Plan and similar. I also write to environmental sounds, or I have a playlist of mood songs and use that when I want to really lean into a fiction scene. When I write novels, I write all the best/most interesting scenes first, then I go back and write what happens before and after the most interesting scenes. Same for screenplays and fiction podcast scripts.</p>
<h2>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</h2>
<p>I always write at a desk with a full keyboard. I never write on my phone unless I have a Bluetooth keyboard with me. If I write in public, I always people watch and eavesdrop on random conversations because that's fantastic ways to study people and how they interact with others. I write a lot in libraries because I don't have to buy anything, and I can reserve rooms all day if I want to write away from home, all for free.</p>
<h2>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</h2>
<p>The blog is currently a CMS called ClassicPress hosted by Project Army. As for how I write, if I write in HTML or similar, I then write in Markdown or a similar fashion in a plain text editor. I write all my novels in plain text and or Markdown then convert them later. I write all my screenplays and fiction podcast scripts in Fountain. Those are all plain text solutions. After I'm all done, I convert the plain text screenplay or novel into a formatted book or formatted screenplay using open-source tools like Pandoc.</p>
<h2>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</h2>
<p>If I had to start over, I’d go with a static site generator first because it will have better longevity than a CMS database. I wouldn't change anything else. The title, content, anything.</p>
<h2>Financial question since the Web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost, or does it generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetizing personal blogs?</h2>
<p>I pay about $200 biannually for my blog to be hosted. I rely entirely on donations and a shared funding model where people financially sponsor my hosts and otherwise to keep me online. I'm fully reader supported, and the blog doesn’t make a profit. I'm not intending to sell people’s data or have ads on my blog. That's just a poor reader experience. I often joke that if you want to take me offline, just stop donating to me, because that will be the day I finally just let the blog go.</p>
<h2>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</h2>
<p>I highly recommend the podcast/blog Reid my Mind radio. I also think you should check out Jonathan Mosen blog. I listen to more podcasts than I read any particular blog, which is ironic because I have over 100 RSS feeds, but I don't have any particular blog recommendations. I do recommend people read some fanfiction on Archive of Our Own, though!</p>
<h2>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</h2>
<p>Because I'm such a fiction podcast guru, I’d highly recommend checking out the Fiction Podcast the Bright Sessions or the Two Princes. I’d also suggest the best place, I think, to find fiction podcasts is <a href="https://www.theend.fyi/">https://www.theend.fyi/</a> but I also recommend watching any movie with audio description enabled and not looking at the screen. You can find movies with audio description at <a href="https://adp.acb.org/masterad.html">https://adp.acb.org/masterad.html</a></p>

## North Korea condemns new US nuclear strategic plan report

date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA

Seoul, South Korea — North Korea vowed Saturday to advance its nuclear capabilities, reacting to a report that the United States had revised its own nuclear strategic plan.


The country will "bolster up its strategic strength in every way to control and eliminate all sorts of security challenges that may result from Washington's revised plan," the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.


The New York Times reported this week that a U.S. plan approved by President Joe Biden in March was to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea.


The highly classified plan for the first time reorients Washington's deterrent strategy to focus on China's rapid expansion in its nuclear arsenal, the Times said.


KCNA said North Korea's foreign ministry "expresses serious concern over and bitterly denounces and rejects the behavior of the U.S."


It added North Korea vowed to push forward the building of nuclear force sufficient and reliable enough to firmly defend its sovereignty.


Pyongyang and Moscow have been allies since North Korea's founding after World War II and have drawn even closer since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.


The United States and Seoul have accused North Korea of providing ammunition and missiles to Russia for its war in Ukraine.


Pyongyang, which has declared itself an "irreversible" nuclear weapons power, has described allegations of supplying weapons to Russia as "absurd."


However, it did thank Russia for using its United Nations veto in March to effectively end monitoring of sanctions violations just as UN experts were starting to probe alleged arms transfers.


China, also a key ally of North Korea, presents itself as a neutral party in Russia's offensive on Ukraine and says it is not sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the United States and other Western nations.


But it is a close political and economic ally of Russia, and NATO members have branded Beijing a "decisive enabler" of the war.


Moscow has looked to Beijing as an economic lifeline since the Ukraine conflict began, with the two boosting trade to record highs as Russia faces heavy sanctions from the West.

## Archaeologists in Virginia find colonial-era garden, clues about slaves who tended it

date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA

williamsburg, virginia — Archaeologists in Virginia are uncovering one of colonial America's most lavish displays of opulence: an ornamental garden where a wealthy politician and enslaved gardeners grew exotic plants from around the world. 


Such plots dotted Britain's colonies and served as status symbols for the elite. They were the 18th-century equivalent of buying a Lamborghini. 


The garden in Williamsburg belonged to John Custis IV, a tobacco plantation owner who served in Virginia's colonial legislature. He is perhaps best known as the first father-in-law of Martha Washington. She married future U.S. President George Washington after Custis' son Daniel died. 


Historians also have been intrigued by the elder Custis' botanical adventures, which were well-documented in letters and later in books. And yet this excavation is as much about the people who cultivated the land as it is about Custis. 


"The garden may have been Custis' vision, but he wasn't the one doing the work," said Jack Gary, executive director of archaeology at Colonial Williamsburg, a living history museum that now owns the property. "Everything we see in the ground that's related to the garden is the work of enslaved gardeners, many of whom must have been very skilled."

Archaeologists have pulled up fence posts that were 3 feet (1 meter) thick and carved from red cedar. Gravel paths were uncovered, including a large central walkway. Stains in the soil show where plants grew in rows. 


The dig also has unearthed a pierced coin that was typically worn as a good-luck charm by young African Americans. Workers have also found the shards of an earthenware chamber pot, or portable toilet, that likely was used by people who were enslaved. 


Animals appear to have been intentionally buried under some fence posts. They included two chickens with their heads removed, as well as a single cow's foot. A snake without a skull was found in a shallow hole that had likely contained a plant. 


"We have to wonder if we're seeing traditions that are non-European," Gary said. "Are they West African traditions? We need to do more research. But it's features like those that make us continue to try and understand the enslaved people who were in this space." 




The museum tells the story of Virginia's colonial capital through interpreters and restored buildings on 300 acres (120 hectares), which include parts of the original city. Founded in 1926, the museum did not start telling stories about Black Americans until 1979, even though more than half of the 2,000 people who lived there were Black, the majority enslaved. 


In recent years, the museum has boosted efforts to tell a more complete story, while trying to attract more Black visitors. It plans to reconstruct one of the nation's oldest Black churches and is restoring what is believed to be the country's oldest surviving schoolhouse for Black children. 


There also are plans to re-create Custis' Williamsburg home and garden, known then as Custis Square. Unlike some historic gardens, the restoration will be done without the benefit of surviving maps or diagrams, relying instead on what Gary described as the most detailed landscape archaeology effort in the museum's history. 


The garden disappeared after Custis' death in 1749. But the dig has determined it was about two-thirds the size of a football field, while descriptions from the time refer to lead statues of Greek gods and topiaries trimmed into balls and pyramids. 


Correspondence with Briton


The garden's legacy has lived on through Custis' correspondence with British botanist Peter Collinson, who traded plants with other horticulturalists around the globe. From 1734 to 1746, Custis and Collinson exchanged seeds and letters via merchant ships crossing the Atlantic. 


The men possibly introduced new plants to their respective communities, said Eve Otmar, Colonial Williamsburg's master of historic gardening. For instance, Custis is believed to have made one of Williamsburg's earliest written mentions of growing tomatoes, known then as "apples of love" and native to Mexico and Central and South America. 


Custis' gardeners also planted strawberries, pistachios and almonds, among 100 other imported plants. It's not always clear from his letters which were successful in the Virginia climate. A recent pollen analysis of the soil indicates the past presence of stone fruits, such as peaches and cherries, which weren't a big surprise. 


The garden existed at a time when European empires and slavery were still expanding. Botanical gardens often were used for discovering new cash crops that could enrich colonial powers. 


But Custis' garden was primarily about showing off his wealth. A study of the area's topography placed his garden in direct view of Williamsburg's only church house at the time. Everyone would have seen the garden's fence, but few were invited inside. 


Exotic lily


Custis delighted his guests with the likes of the crown imperial lily, which was native to the Middle East and parts of Asia, and boasted clusters of drooping, bell-shaped flowers. 


"In the 18th century, those were unusual things," Otmar said. "Only certain classes of people got to experience that. A wealthy person today — they buy a Lamborghini." 


The museum is still trying to learn more about the people who worked in the garden. 


Crystal Castleberry, Colonial Williamsburg's public archaeologist, has met with descendants of the more than 200 people who were enslaved by the Custis family on his various plantations. But there is too little information in surviving documents to determine if an ancestor lived and worked at Custis Square. 


Two people, named Cornelia and Beck, were listed as property with the Williamsburg estate after Daniel Custis died in 1757. But their names prompt only more questions about who they were and what happened to them. 


"Are they related to one another?" Castleberry asked. "Do they fear being split up or sold? Or are they going to be reunited with loved ones on other properties?"

## Florida quietly removes LGBTQ+ travel info from state website

date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA

TALLAHASSEE, Fla.  — Key West, Fort Lauderdale, Wilton Manors and St. Petersburg are among several Florida cities that have long been top U.S. destinations for LGBTQ tourists. So it came as a surprise this week when travelers learned that Florida's tourism marketing agency quietly removed the "LGBTQ Travel" section from its website sometime in the past few months.


Business owners who cater to Florida's LGBTQ tourists said Wednesday that it marked the latest attempt by officials in the state to erase the LGBTQ community. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis previously championed a bill to forbid classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity, and supported a ban on gender-affirming care for minors, as well as a law meant to keep children out of drag shows.


"It's just disgusting to see this," said Keith Blackburn, who heads the Greater Fort Lauderdale LGBT Chamber of Commerce. "They seem to want to erase us."


The change to Visit Florida's website was first reported by NBC News, which noted a search query still pulls up some listings for LGBTQ-friendly places despite the elimination of the section.


John Lai, who chairs Visit Florida's board, didn't respond to an email seeking comment Tuesday. Dana Young, Visit Florida's CEO and president, didn't respond to a voicemail message Wednesday, and neither did the agency's public relations director.


Visit Florida is a public-private partnership between the state of Florida and the state's tourism industry. The state contributes about $50 million each year to the quasi-public agency from two tourism and economic development funds.


Florida is one of the most popular states in the U.S. for tourists, and tourism is one of its biggest industries. Nearly 141 million tourists visited Florida in 2023, with out-of-state visitors contributing more than $102 billion to Florida's economy.


Before the change, the LGBTQ section on Visit Florida's website had read, "There's a sense of freedom to Florida's beaches, the warm weather and the myriad activities — a draw for people of all orientations, but especially appealing to a gay community looking for a sense of belonging and acceptance."


Blackburn said the change and other anti-LGBTQ policies out of Tallahassee make it more difficult for him to promote South Florida tourism since he encounters prospective travelers or travel promoters who say they don't want to do business in the state.


Last year, for instance, several civil rights groups issued a travel advisory for Florida, saying that policies championed by DeSantis and Florida lawmakers are "openly hostile toward African Americans, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals."


But visitors should also understand that many Florida cities are extremely inclusive, with gay elected officials and LGBTQ-owned businesses, and they don't reflect the policies coming from state government, Blackburn added.


"It's difficult when these kinds of stories come out, and the state does these things, and we hear people calling for a boycott," Blackburn said. "On one level, it's embarrassing to have to explain why people should come to South Florida and our destination when the state is doing these things."

## Sidelined at the DNC, pro-Palestinian Democrats still see progress

date: 2024-08-24, from: VOA News USA

Chicago — Hundreds of pro-Palestinian delegates were sidelined at the Democratic National Convention that ended with Vice President Kamala Harris reaffirming her support for Israel.


"The people of Israel must never again face the horror that a terrorist organization called Hamas caused on October 7," she said in her speech accepting the party’s presidential nomination Thursday evening.


As anti-war protesters filled the streets throughout the week, 270 pro-Palestinian Democrats calling themselves "cease-fire delegates" signed a petition demanding Harris, if she’s elected, enact an arms embargo on Israel.


The unheeded petition was pushed by leaders of the "Uncommitted" movement, which garnered hundreds of thousands of votes in Democratic primaries across the nation.


These delegates staged a sit-in outside Chicago’s United Center, the convention’s venue, to protest the Democratic National Committee, who denied a speaking request for Tanya Haj-Hassan, a pediatric doctor who treats wounded children in Gaza.


The DNC, according to Uncommitted National Movement spokesperson Layla Elabed, didn’t want Harris to be "overshadowed."


Asked by VOA for a reaction to Elabed’s claim, the Harris campaign said, "There have been a number of speakers who have spoken about the war in Gaza and the need to secure a cease-fire and hostage deal."


Uncommitted delegates


Elabed spoke to VOA on behalf of the 30 "Uncommitted" delegates who voted present in the nomination roll call. That’s less than 1% of the roughly 4,700 delegates who voted for Harris.


The pro-Palestinian group, however, was given a speaking opportunity Monday in a panel event outside of the convention.


Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a Muslim sympathetic to the Palestinian cause who spoke on the panel, was given time at the convention main stage on Wednesday. However, he did not mention Gaza in his speech.


The war in Gaza is "not the topic that I would decide" to speak about, Ellison told VOA before his speech, indicating that pragmatism is key to affect change within the party.


"I'm not one of those people who believe that we vote for perfection. What we vote for is conversation," he said.


Party platform supports Israel


As the convention kicked off, Democrats voted to adopt the party’s platform that recommitted support for Israel, a cease-fire for hostage release deal and the two-state solution.


Pro-Palestinian delegates tried to include language backing enforcement of laws that ban giving military aid to individuals or security forces that commit gross violations of human rights.


"What we are asking is that our tax dollars not be used to kill men, women and children. This is not a controversial demand and is actually more aligned with our Democratic values," Elabed said.


Compared to Biden, Harris appears to offer more sympathy for Palestinian suffering, repeating Thursday of the "devastating" situation in Gaza over the past 10 months."


"So many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, over and over again," she said in her convention speech. "The scale of suffering is heartbreaking."


But policy-wise she signaled continuity from the current administration.


"President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination," she said in her speech to thunderous applause.


Harris’ current and former aides say her Israel policy is unlikely to diverge from President Joe Biden. Halie Soifer, national security adviser to Harris while she was in the Senate, said that the vice president has always been a "strong supporter of the U.S.-Israel relationship," while upholding humanitarian values.


"She does not want to see the suffering of innocent civilians, nor do the vast majority of Americans and Jewish Americans," said Soifer, who is now CEO of Jewish Democratic Council of America.


"We don't have to view it through binary lens," she told VOA. "We support both."


Not discouraged


Uncommitted delegates say they’re not discouraged.


Inga Gibson, a delegate from Hawaii, a state where seven out of 31 delegates are uncommitted, said she has made "tremendous progress" with her fellow delegates.


"I found that a lot of people are really with us on this issue, but they don't know where to begin or how to get involved," she told VOA.


She and other uncommitted delegates gave out keffiyehs, "Democrats for Gaza" flyers and "No More Bombs" pins. The pro-Palestinian symbols are emblematic of a key area of disagreement among Democrats – how much support to give to Israel.


Pro-Israel delegates say it should not create division within the party.


"We can all do better to try to understand the complications of the conflict," Andrew Lachman, a delegate from California told VOA. "We're all concerned about the civilians of Gaza, but we're also concerned about the people of Israel and their safety and security."


Polls show an increasing number of Americans want their leaders to reduce support for Israel. Some say Harris missed an opportunity.


As a former prosecutor, Harris can and should strictly enforce laws and suspend weapons even to allies who violate international or U.S. law, said Nancy Okail, president and CEO of the Center for International Policy, a left-leaning think tank.


"She could make clear this doesn’t just apply to their misuse by Israel to cause disproportionate civilian harm in Gaza, but to their misuse by Netanyahu’s extremist government to dispossess and abuse Palestinians in the occupied West Bank," she told VOA.


Turning protest into agenda


Scholars of social movements say it takes time and work to turn protests into a political agenda. Elisabeth Clemens, a sociologist from the University of Chicago, said that includes building coalitions, negotiating and compromising.


"Finding a way forward that almost never gets all the way to where the protesters hoped it would get but is nevertheless an important change," she told VOA.


And on an issue as complicated as the Middle East peace process, there are different pressures exerted on multiple sides.


"American domestic politics only garners a slice of that," she said.


Elabed said they’re in for the long game.


"Our strategy is not to abandon the Democratic Party, but to essentially revolutionize the Democratic Party and listen to its core base."


For now, the vice president is their best bet.


"I don’t care what you think, you need to win to have power," Ellison said. "Harris, the numbers are up everywhere. The chances for success are higher."

## Vibe Check №34

date: 2024-08-24, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>The temperatures soared over 100ºF and the yard is dead and everything smells roasted. But the ten day forecast shows a ten degree dip and that is cause for celebration. Another school year has started. My son has started middle school and my daughter is now in third grade. It’s shocking how fast life goes. And on the workfront, the pace is picking up now that everyone has come back from summer vacation.</p>
<p>A lot has transpired since the previous vibe check (vacations, new pets, rock shows). To start it off, my family escaped the heat and went to San Diego (as is the custom) for one good week and one awful week…</p>
<h2>San Diego: The First Good Week</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/sandiego.jpg" alt="Left: a pink beach drink. Right a dark sunset over Mission Bay San Diego" /></p>
<p>We flew out to Phoenix to join up with my wife’s family and caravan out to San Diego. We had a family dinner the night before and got to see my one year old grandnephew for the first time in a long while. He’s a sweet kid but does not want his Granduncle Dave holding him yet.</p>
<p>The next day we loaded up the beach gear and drove to a resort in Mission Beach in San Diego for a four day stay. We had a great time with my wife’s family letting the cousins run loose while grown-ups played tennis, pickleball, and I played my annual round of golf with my male in-laws. After four days of big family time we scooted up to Encinitas to stay for two nights with our Austin friends whose summer rental had a guest house.</p>
<p>Encinitas was super charming. We stayed near <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g32355-d12186525-Reviews-Beacon_s_Beach-Encinitas_California.html">Beacons Beach</a> which is one of those cool beaches at the bottom of a cliffside. We beached pretty hard. My daughter and her oldest bestie pranced up and down the shoreline for hours and she even learned to surf. The contrast between Mission and Encinitas couldn’t be more stark. The trip could have ended there and would have been one of the best vacations in the books. But we weren’t done! We planned to extend the trip with a one-week rental in Mission Bay.</p>
<h2>San Diego: The Second Awful Week</h2>
<p>The minute we checked into our beachside rental the whole vibe shifted. From tranquil Encinitas to getting blasted with the sounds (and smells) of Mission Beach. Honking, motorcycles, bottles clanking, fighting, garbage trucks, neighbors blasting bad music, and smells drifting up from the alleyway. It felt like going from a yoga retreat to a frat house. Then it got worse. That night our daughter said she didn’t feel well and the next day my wife started going downhill.</p>
<p>A week of beach fun turned into spending thousands of dollars to be sick inside a beach-adjacent summer rental watching SpongeBob Squarepants on repeat. After three urgent care visits over two days the sick members of our party had the required antibiotics to start feeling better. The next day, we went home.</p>
<p>And –as if it couldn’t get any better– I got COVID on the plane ride back. Ughck.</p>
<h2>We adopted two new pups</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/dogs.jpg" alt="One black dog with one brown eye and one blue eye and a black and white dog with pointy ears and two blue eyes, both staring at the camera" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Laneige (aka “Laney”) - A black lab mix with one brown eye and one blue eye. She’s an attention thief who is not shy about demanding pets.</li>
<li>Rosebud - A lab mix with expressive pointy ears and two blue eyes (some heeler in there?). She’s the more anxious of the two, but once befriended will roll over for belly rubs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our kids have been asking for a new dog for over a year. Every day this summer I’d step into the house and my daughter would spin a laptop around to show me the new dogs she found on <a href="https://www.austinpetsalive.org/">the Austin Pets Alive! website</a>. She even wrote a song to try to convince me to get a dog. 🥺 They were dead set on a pup named “Laneige” (named by the shelter after a Korean lip balm).</p>
<p>After dropping the kids off at grandma’s house for a long weekend, we set our plan into action: adopt a dog and surprise the kids. But our plans changed when the shelter brought out Laneige’s sister Rosebud (also named after a lip balm) to our meet and greet. Her pointy ears and blue eyes were too cute. We tend to play it more conservative when it comes to big life choices but we decided to go full stupid for once and surprise the kids with not one dog, but two dogs!</p>
<p>Names may change and we daily ask ourselves “Did we overdo it?” but generally we’re happy with the new additions.</p>
<h2>Frostapalooza</h2>

<p>A year ago Brad Frost called my wife and I to share a wild idea for his 40th birthday party: get all his musician friends from all over the world together on one stage for one night of rocking out. Over the course of the next year we picked songs, learned parts, recorded tracks, hoping –but never knowing– how it would all turn out when we assembled in Pittsburgh for one night of rock.</p>
<p>It. Was. Phenomenal.</p>
<p>Nothing could have prepared me for the blast from the five piece horn section. It sounded perfect. It felt big. Dozens of people on stage playing together for the first time, but you wouldn’t know it. Music –good music– filling the halls of an old church. I’m a foot away from a bass guitar amp but I can’t hear the bass because there’s so much music happening. In the crowd I see people listening to my wife sing –they’re singing along– and it takes me back to when I first heard her sing at a karaoke bar in Los Angeles when I fell in love with her.</p>

<p>Outside the main event, it felt good to put kindling on some friendships. I got to see <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/">Chris</a>, which is always pleasant to see the one person I’m guaranteed to have an hour long conversation every week. <a href="https://www.zachmeyer.com/">Zach</a> &amp; Danh (my co-hosts from <a href="https://asidequest.simplecast.com/">Aside Quest</a>) flew up on the same flight. But I got to see and chat with new and old friends as well; <a href="https://ianfrostweather.com/">Ian</a>, <a href="https://www.dandenney.com/">Dan</a>, <a href="https://bencallahan.com/">Ben</a>, <a href="https://www.hawksworx.com/about">Phil</a>, <a href="https://www.mikeaparicio.com/">Mike</a>, <a href="https://www.jina.me/">Jina</a>, <a href="https://github.com/break-stuff">Burton</a>, <a href="https://www.adekunleoduye.com/">Adekunle</a>, <a href="https://kevincoyle.co.uk/">Kevin</a>, <a href="https://bkardell.com/">Brian</a>, <a href="https://jenson.org/">Scott</a>, <a href="https://bigmedium.com/">Josh</a>, Veronika, <a href="https://ryantrimble.com/">Ryan</a>, <a href="https://joshuasager.com/">Joshua</a>, <a href="https://www.jjeff.com/">Jeff</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.littlechair.com/">Jenn</a> &amp; <a href="https://arlorobbins.com/">Arlo</a>, <a href="https://adactio.com/">Jeremy</a> &amp; Jessica, <a href="https://bethan.bandcamp.com/">Daniel &amp; Jessi</a>, <a href="https://www.lovejerks.com/">Rebecca &amp; Ryan</a>, and countless more folks. Since the US web development conference scene has more or less imploded since the pandemic, this felt a bit like a family reunion with some of my favorite people from around the world.</p>
<p>In the end, <a href="https://frostapalooza.bradfrost.com/">Frostapalooza</a> was a magical night celebrating the power of music and friendship. It feels a bit like a dream now and when I explain it to people my words fall short. An ephemeral joyous moment and I have no idea if I’ll do anything like that in my life again. That’s special. The biggest thanks to Brad, Melissa, and Ella who sacrificed a lot of time, money, and life-force to pull it off.</p>
<h2>The stats, o the stats.</h2>
<p>Okay, quantifiers. Calm down. Here’s your beefsteak of itemized inputs and outputs.</p>
<h3>🧠 Learning</h3>
<ul>
<li>When I got sick I did a deep dive in playing with <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> and building a vault. I’m still on Notion (for now) but the jump is less intimidating. I like the indie/privacy angle of Obsidian a lot but from a UX perspective it feels “finicky” when mousing over content in a way that Notion doesn’t. The level of customization is also nicer in Obsidian, but also a potential endless rabbit hole for my distracted brain. Moving my “second brain” is not a task I want to take lightly.</li>
<li>Watching countless Obsidian videos exposed me to a new organization system: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d93SGaf82OM">August Bradley’s “Pillars, Pipelines, and Vaults” (PPV) system</a>. I’m not ready to ditch <a href="https://daverupert.com/2022/04/productivity-sniped-by-para/">my Notion PARA setup</a>, but the idea PPV introduces that I’m gravitating towards is that my brain is a system of “Inputs” (links, books, and notes vaults) and “Outputs” (blog posts, side projects, and task pipelines) and those exist across “Areas” (pillars) in my life. Inputs need organization (e.g. folders and/or tags) and outputs need a process (e.g. <a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/09/my-notion-blogging-kanban/">a kanban</a>). I think Obsidian fits this paradigm better than Notion.</li>

Shockingly, I didn’t disagree with much here… except that crypto is the solution to the problems outlined in the book. He spent chapters pitching ideas that crypto could solve (decentralized social networks, carrying over video game assets, etc) and those have since been debunked. There’s <em>still</em> no job that crypto does better than a database. Ultimately I think it’s a question of “Who benefits?” when it comes to this technology and I think the answer is: the people who already own a lot of it.</li>
<li>Humankind by Rutger Bregman - I’ve read this book before but it’s a pleasant little dose of positivity. Are we humans that trample each other while leaving a burning plane? Or are we humans that help each other get off the plane? The answer might surprise you.</li>
<li>Slow Productivity by Cal Newport - I liked this book better than the last but I think it suffers from the same problems all his books do… he’s shielded by academia and not that busy of a person. I laughed out loud when he used Jane Austen as an example of Slow Productivity (paraphrasing) “After her father sold the farm and the school and they moved to a beach town, she was able to slow down.” Like, yeah dude, I could slow down too if my dad retired and sold the literal farm.</li>

## RFK Jr. suspends presidential campaign, endorses Trump

date: 2024-08-23, from: VOA News USA

washington — Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent U.S. presidential candidate with a famous political pedigree but whose bid was overshadowed by a brain worm and a dead bear, has announced the suspension of his campaign, endorsing the Republican Party's nominee, former President Donald Trump.


"In my heart, I no longer believe I have a realistic path to an electoral victory," Kennedy told a group of reporters and supporters in Phoenix. "I am not terminating my campaign. I am simply suspending it," he added, explaining he did not want to help Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party nominee.


In 10 states where he could be a spoiler, Kennedy said he would have his name removed, but it would stay on the ballot in others where he said supporters could safely vote for him without risk of aiding the Democrats.


Kennedy on Thursday filed paperwork withdrawing from the ballot in Arizona, one of the swing states likely to determine the outcome of November's presidential election.


"My joining the Trump campaign will be a difficult sacrifice," Kennedy said in Phoenix, adding it would be worthwhile if he gets a chance in a Republican administration to end what he contends is a wave of chronic diseases among America's children.


"In an honest system, I believe I would have won the election," said Kennedy, alleging that the mainstream media censored him while the Democratic Party thwarted his access to the ballot in numerous states.


He said Trump's promise to negotiate an end to Russia's war on Ukraine "alone would justify my support for his campaign."


Kennedy stepped off the podium after 50 minutes, taking no questions.


He appeared later in the day at a Trump rally in neighboring Glendale.


"For the past 16 months, Bobby has run an extraordinary campaign for president of the United States," said Trump. "I know because he also went after me a couple of times."


Famous name


A 70-year-old environmental lawyer, Kennedy labeled himself a political outsider despite his lineage. He entered the presidential race as a longshot Democratic Party candidate before dropping that bid last October and announcing he would mount an independent campaign.


With a surname almost synonymous with the Democratic Party (he is the nephew of President John. F. Kennedy and son of former U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, both of whom were assassinated in the 1960s), RFK Jr. began his campaign polling in the low double digits in some states.


Trump, at Friday evening’s political event, said if he gets back in the White House, he will appoint an independent commission on assassination attempts and release all government documents related to the 1963 assassination of President Kennedy.


Siblings of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are decrying their brother’s endorsement of Trump.


Our brother Bobby’s decision to endorse Trump today is a betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold most dear. It is a sad end to a sad story," Kerry Kennedy wrote in a statement along with three of her sisters and two of her brothers.


The extended Kennedy family had earlier expressed embarrassment and denounced their relative's campaign after he dropped out of the Democratic Party, choosing instead to support the reelection of President Joe Biden, who dropped out of the race and was replaced by Harris last month.


The shakeup in the Democrats' lineup further eroded support for Kennedy, who had benefited from those unenthused about a rematch of the 2020 election between Biden and Trump.


"The more voters learned about RFK Jr. the less they liked him. Donald Trump isn't earning an endorsement that's going to help build support, he's inheriting the baggage of a failed fringe candidate. Good riddance," said Democratic National Committee senior adviser Mary Beth Cahill in a statement following Kennedy's announcement.


Fringe appeal


Kennedy, labeled a conspiracy theorist by his critics, appealed to some anti-establishment voters attracted by his contrarian foreign policy and long-standing campaign against vaccines. But he faced mainstream disdain and even ridicule.


In May, Kennedy said a "brain fog" he suffered a decade ago was caused by a parasitic worm that had eaten part of his brain.


Kennedy more recently was the target of late-night TV comedians and social media satire after he revealed that he had dumped a dead bear cub in New York City's Central Park in 2014 as a prank.


A magazine article in July alleged Kennedy had molested a family babysitter decades ago. Asked about the allegation on a podcast, he said he was "not a church boy" and had "many skeletons" in his closet.


"Third-party candidates often lose steam as the election approaches, but Kennedy's trajectory has been particularly ignominious," said Nate Silver, a statistician and prominent election forecaster, in a Substack posting on Thursday.


"In three-way polls against Biden and Trump, he initially polled at 10 or 11 percent, then gradually faded to 8 (save for a bounce just after Biden's awful debate). In the Trump-Harris matchup, though, he's dropped to about 4 percent."


Trump has offered to "enlist" him in a second administration, Kennedy said on Friday.


Trump, the previous day, acknowledged he had spoken with Kennedy several times but not recently.


Trump told CNN Tuesday that he would "be open" to Kennedy playing a part in his administration if Kennedy dropped his presidential bid and endorsed the Republican nominee.


Kennedy's running mate, Nicole Shanahan, suggested in an interview Tuesday that Kennedy would do "an incredible job" as the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.


Kennedy has claimed that agencies under HHS, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health, have been captured by corporate interests, making them predators on the American public.


"I love the idea of giving him some sort of role in some sort of major three-letter entity or whatever it may be and let him blow it up," the Republican nominee's son, Donald Trump Jr., told a conservative radio talk show on Wednesday.


'Spoiler' for MAGA?


Democratic National Committee adviser Ramsey Reid argued in a memo released Friday that Kennedy’s role from the beginning had been to serve as a "spoiler" who would help Trump by drawing votes away from the Democratic candidate.


"He was recruited into the race by MAGA Republicans like Steve Bannon, his candidacy was propped up by Trump's largest donor, and he parroted MAGA attacks on President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris," Reid said.


On Thursday, at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, some delegates looked forward to Kennedy’s withdrawal from the race.


Montana delegate Mary Jo O'Rourke, whose father worked for RFK Jr.'s father in the Justice Department, told VOA she is a devotee of the Kennedy family, but it is time for the former Democrat "to go home and enjoy the rest of his life."


Kennedy had initially been viewed as siphoning more votes from Biden than Trump, but recent polls indicated he was appearing to attract more voters who would otherwise be inclined to cast a ballot for the Republican nominee.


Of those who supported Kennedy in July, 4 in 10 shifted to Harris (compared with 2 in 10 who switched to Trump), according to Pew Research Center polling released last week.


Most voters, as the election day approaches, "go back to their parties. They're not looking for an independent candidate. They're looking to vote for one of the two likely winners," John Fortier, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told VOA.


In a tight election in the half dozen or so swing states that will tip the balance of the electoral vote count, the presence or absence of a third party or independent candidate on the ballot could determine the overall outcome.


The victor of the U.S. presidential race must win 270 electoral votes, with each state's allocation equal to the number of senators and representatives it has in the Congress. It is possible for a candidate to receive the most total votes but lose the electoral vote count and thus the presidency.


Kennedy told reporters on Friday he could still win if the Electoral College vote for Trump and Harris ends up tied at 269. In that case, members of the new Congress would select the president in early January.

## Addressing the National Security Risks of Bulk Data in the Age of AI 

date: 2024-08-23, updated: 2024-08-23, from: RAND blog

There is an urgent need for a more nuanced and empirically grounded approach to data regulation, one that recognizes how seemingly innocuous data points can, when amassed in large quantities, pose substantial risks to national security.

## Why has the Internet of Things failed?

According to a survey last year, less than 50% of appliances that are internet-capable ever get connected. When I talk to manufacturers, I often hear even worse numbers, sometimes below 30%! Despite many years and billions of dollars of investment into the “Internet of Things”, this lack of adoption makes it clear that even if [&#8230;]

## 2024-08-19 Something new: intrigue

date: 2024-08-23, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-19-something-new-intrigue">2024-08-19 Something new: intrigue</h1>

<p>A while ago, <a class="account" href="https://ttrpg-hangout.social/@enfors" title="@enfors@ttrpg-hangout.social">@enfors</a> said he wanted his sandbox generator supplement to have something special.
I wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure what he was thinking of, but I started thinking about the things that I feel are under-explored.</p>

<p>A while ago, for example, I wondered: What would be the simplest game that emphasises how many friends you make, that rewards the size of the community you build?
Back in 2016 I wrote a game called <a href="2016-08-19_Romantic_Fantasy">Best Friends</a> that I never used.
It was <a href="2019-10-10_Non-adventure_games%3F">still an adventure game</a>.
Basically, replace your &ldquo;level&rdquo; with the number of friends you have.
Something like that.</p>

<p>But that still doesn&rsquo;t get into really new territory.
Something I would like to see is a system for how to run an intrigue as a party – including everybody at the table, for all the classes and skill profiles.
I feel that <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> attempted to do this but the result wasn’t great, at least at my table.</p>

<p>Quoting my past self:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m also not too happy with A Song of Ice and Fire. We’ve only played three times, so I’m willing to give it more time. When I ran one of the sessions I basically split the party to the max since since all characters are so diverse. There is no D&amp;D like party and that also requires me to rethink my adventure design. – <a href="2010-04-08_Spring">2010-04-08 Spring</a></p>

<p>I can always switch into a movie director stance, go around the table, point at players, “now you!” and after a bit when the exchange happened and a die was maybe cast, “as we wait for that, we cut to…” and soon enough “in the mean time…” – and I do this aggressively, in small time slots. This results in a somewhat military style of pointing at people to let them know that now is their turn, while simultaneously waving at others to hold their thoughts, or maybe cutting talkative players off when they’re running too long. It’s weird, but when there’s a lot of players, or when there’s no party play to return to, it works well enough. We’ve made these kinds of mistakes in games where there are characters that are well suited for fighting and others that are not, with their players trying to solve problems by fighting, and players do not. This happened to me when I ran a one-shot of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>. It worked for a session, but it was exhausting and I don’t want to claim that it’s a good solution. It was simply a short term solution that worked, for me. Next time, however, make sure players create characters that will adventure together. – <a href="2021-02-27_Cohesion">2021-02-27 Cohesion</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps the split into combat and intrigue that the game introduced wasn&rsquo;t good game design because it made sense from the perspective of emulating the books but it didn&rsquo;t make sense from the perspective of some people wanting to play a game together. Or maybe it just didn&rsquo;t fit my expectations of what it means to play together. Or maybe we just missed the implied recommendation to focus on either combat or intrigue and everybody having two characters, one for each domain. Or maybe just run either a combat campaign or an intrigue campaign.</p>

<p>So what I&rsquo;m looking for is a way to get intrigue results, using procedures like we do for combat or exploration, for dungeons or the wilderness. The goal is to bring about a change in leadership of a town, a gang, a castle, an army unit, or to succeed in an act of sabotage, to incite a rebellion – things that are either hand-waved or the party is hired for the dirty work while the non-player characters are the politicians and rabble-rousers. I know this can work. It&rsquo;s OK for the party to do the dirty work, to assassinate a tyrant and the non-player characters then taking the throne and similar things, but I want to go further. I want to involve all the players at the table. I want the players to think about the logistics of war, the organising and preparations of revolutions, the intricacies of marriage politics.</p>

<p>What if B/X D&amp;D went levels 1–3 is for dungeons, 4–6 is for the wilderness and 7–9 is <em>for politics</em>. Doesn&rsquo;t that sound fantastic? What sort of rules would you find in that third book? You would not get to name level by being a colonizer and clearing the land but by taking over an existing position of power – through intrigue. Oust the abbot, kick out the bishop, marry into the baron&rsquo;s family, take over the guild. With the help of your friends. Without resorting to combat, but with dice rolling.</p>

<p>The dice rolling and the procedures are important to me because otherwise it all goes in a direction I don’t like: <a href="2014-08-21_No_Dice">the referee decides everything and that is exhausting</a>.</p>

<p>Not something like Burning Wheel&rsquo;s Duel of Wits but something like social combat for Fate games, like the <a href="social-combat">social combat system in Diaspora</a>, for example. Note <a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@bradjmurray" title="@bradjmurray@dice.camp">@bradjmurray</a>&rsquo;s most recent take on those rules: <a href="https://vscadotblog.wordpress.com/2020/02/20/social-combat-in-diaspora/">social combat in diaspora</a>.</p>

<p>This space deserves more attention.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23RPG">#RPG</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-08-20</strong>. I find that urban adventures suffer from the same problem. If it&rsquo;s just two or three buildings and those act like dungeons, my games work. If it&rsquo;s just social encounters that can be resolved with reaction rolls, my games work. But everything else in an urban environment seems to be politics, to me. And I have no good procedures to resolve those. So if anybody reading this is thinking about writing a blog post on the topic, I&rsquo;d love to read it.</p>

<p><strong>2024-08-23</strong>. I had forgotten about <a href="2023-11-19-building-blocks">2023-11-19 Campaign building blocks</a> but I’d love starting with a list like that. Lists of dangers, lists of means, lists of procedures, lists of goals.</p>

## A Sigh of Interest Rate Relief for Renewables

date: 2024-08-23, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzUxNTkwNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MDExMzA4MH0.H3g7AqJR9P3NkYf7_81C1yJIjEqCN5HYv9fuhRF4Bro/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Are clean energy developers finally free from high interest rates? Not yet, but this might be the beginning of the end. At the Federal Reserve’s annual conference in Jackson Hole, Fed chair Jerome Powell told attendees, “The time has come for policy to adjust.”</p><p>Analysts and market participants immediately appeared to interpret this as locking in a series of interest rate cuts starting at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting next month. Stocks immediately rose and yields on U.S. government debt fell. Market prognosticators <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-23/powell-says-time-has-come-for-fed-to-cut-interest-rates?srnd=homepage-americas" target="_blank"><u>expect</u></a> the federal funds rate to fall a quarter of a percentage point at the September meeting, but there’s a reasonable chance the cut would be larger.</p><p>The renewable energy industry — or at least its share prices — got in on the party. Shares of NextEra, which has a massive renewables business, rose following the speech. The stock price of Iberdrola, the Spanish utility with a large wind business, rose after text of the speech was released. The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF, which tracks a range of clean energy companies, is up more than 2.5% today. (No such luck for GE Vernova, which manufactures wind turbines — <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-22/ge-vernova-sees-another-blade-failure-at-uk-offshore-wind-farm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>its shares fell today</u></a> after another turbine blade failure at the Dogger Bank wind farm off the coast of England, coming barely a month after a blade manufacturing defect led to the <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/vineyard-wind-turbine-nantucket?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2" target="_self"><u>Vineyard Wind disaster</u></a>.)</p><p>Renewables investors are particularly giddy at the moment because <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/fed-interest-rate-renewables">for years now</a>, the industry has disproportionately suffered the effects of high interest rates compared to fossil fuels. Unlike a natural gas- or coal-fired power plant, a wind turbine or a solar panel does not have to pay for its fuel. In the long term that’s a win, because there is no such thing as a wind pipeline rupture or the discovery of new reserves of sun, and therefore nothing that can send prices reeling. But in the short term, that means the lifetime cost of a solar or wind farm is heavily weighted towards building it.</p><p>And to build, you need to borrow money.</p><p>“Wind and solar have taken a beating from high interest rates because they’re very capital intensive projects,” Lori Bird, director of the World Resources Institute’s U.S. Energy Program, told me. “Because they’re capital intensive, a 2 percentage point increase in interest rates yields a 20% increase in the cost of electricity, compared to 11% from fossil,” Bird said, <a href="https://www.woodmac.com/blogs/the-edge/higher-interest-rates-could-hold-up-energy-investment/" target="_blank"><u>citing estimates from Wood Mackenzie</u></a>.</p><p>Developers take out construction loans to build their projects and then pay those back with a term loan that covers the life of the project, explained Advait Arun, senior associate of energy finance at the Center for Public Enterprise (and also a Heatmap contributor).</p><p>“If you’re a developer who’s going through the construction process right now, your construction loan is probably floating-rate, so the amount of of interest you’re paying on your construction loan will fall,” Arun said. After you're done building, you get another loan to pay off the construction loan, and that loan can be smaller if your construction loan gets cheaper thanks to lower rates<strong>.</strong></p><p>These longer-term loans are paid back from the project’s revenues over the life span of the project, which means that the developer or investor will not have to earn as much from selling the electricity to cover the cost of their debt.</p><p>Alongside the supply chain issues and inflation that developers — especially offshore wind developers — had to deal with over the last few years, high interest rates have led to higher costs for the power that renewables developers sell. The price of power purchase agreements for wind and solar rose in 2023, <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/solar-wind-energy-ppa-power-purchase-agreement-prices-stable-interest-rate-inflation/713800/" target="_blank"><u>thanks, in part, to high rates</u></a>, and only stabilized early this year as investors became convinced that cuts were finally close. </p><p>But whether these lower financing costs turn into higher profits or lower prices for electricity consumers is, unfortunately, not a sure thing — which is one reason why the industry's shareholders may have responded positively to Powell's speech. </p><p>“I think profit expectations will rise,” Arun said. “If there’s less money you need to pay in debt service, it doesn’t mean developers will pass on price savings.”</p>

## US will send $125M in new military aid to Ukraine, say officials

date: 2024-08-23, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration will send about $125 million in new military aid to Ukraine, U.S. officials said Thursday, even as Washington works to get a better understanding of Kyiv's incursion into Russia and how it advances the broader battlefield goals more than two years into the war. 


U.S. officials said the latest package of aid includes air defense missiles, munitions for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), Javelins and an array of other anti-armor missiles, counter-drone and counter-electronic warfare systems and equipment, 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition, vehicles and other equipment. 


The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the aid has not been publicly announced. The formal announcement could come as soon as Friday, which is the eve of Ukraine's Independence Day. 


The weapons are being provided through presidential drawdown authority, which means they are taken from Pentagon stockpiles and can be delivered more quickly. 


The aid comes as Ukrainian forces continue to broaden their surprise offensive into Russia, where officials say they have taken about 100 square kilometers (62 square miles) of territory around Kursk. Russian troops, meanwhile, are making gains in the east, around the Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk, a critical logistics hub. 


Pentagon officials have said repeatedly that the U.S. has been talking with Ukrainian leaders to get a better assessment of their longer-term goals for the Kursk operation, particularly as they see Russia advancing near Pokrovsk. 


If Pokrovsk falls, the defeat would imperil Ukraine's defenses and bring Russia closer to its stated aim of capturing the Donetsk region. Russian soldiers are now just 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) away. 


Asked about the Kursk operation, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Thursday that "we are still working with Ukraine on how that fits into their strategic objectives on the battlefield itself." 


The U.S., she said, understands that Ukraine wants to build a buffer zone along the border, but the administration still has more questions about how it furthers Ukraine's broader war effort. 


Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made his first visit Thursday to the border area where his forces launched the offensive on August 6. He said Kyiv's military had taken control of another Russian village and captured more prisoners of war. 


The latest package of aid brings the total amount of U.S. security assistance to Ukraine to more than $55.7 billion since Russia's invasion in February 2022.

The content is on a transparent background. They are designed to fit in the right margin of my blog at scripting.com. Please remember this definition, so you can help me create new sidebar art.

I'm trying to teach ChatGPT how to do sidebar art. So far, it's not a great student. But I have hope. My instructions for the image in the post in the sidebar for the previous post: "e pluribus unum" is the motto of the United States. Out of many one. I would like a simple picture of an eagle with this motto over its head, in the same style it is in on the back of a quarter coin.

## Oil tanker burns after Yemen rebels' attack in Red Sea

date: 2024-08-23, from: VOA News USA

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Fires broke out Friday on a Greek-flagged oil tanker that was attacked by Yemen's Houthi rebels this week, with the vessel now appearing to be adrift in the Red Sea, authorities said.


It wasn't immediately clear what happened to the oil tanker Sounion, which was abandoned by its crew Thursday and reportedly anchored in place.


The Houthis didn't immediately acknowledge the fire. The rebels are suspected to have gone back and attacked at least one other vessel that later sank as part of their monthslong campaign against shipping in the Red Sea over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. The attacks have disrupted a trade route that typically sees $1 trillion in goods pass through it annually.


The British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center reported the fires in a note to mariners Friday night.


“UKMTO have received a report that three fires have been observed on vessel,” the center said. “The vessel appears to be drifting.”




A U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, said American officials were aware of the fires and continued to monitor the situation.


The vessel had been staffed by a crew of 25 Filipinos and Russians, as well as four private security personnel, who were taken by a French destroyer to nearby Djibouti, the EU's Aspides naval mission in the Red Sea said Thursday.


The Sounion has 150,000 tons of crude oil aboard and represents a “navigational and environmental hazard,” the mission warned. “It is essential that everyone in the area exercises caution and refrains from any actions that could lead to a deterioration of the current situation.”


The Houthis have targeted more than 80 vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that also killed four sailors.


Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets.


The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the United States or Britain to force an end to Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.


As Iran threatens to retaliate against Israel over the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, the U.S. military told the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group to sail more quickly to the area. Early Thursday, the U.S. military’s Central Command said that the Lincoln had reached the waters of the Middle East, without elaborating.


Washington also has ordered the USS Georgia guided missile submarine to the region, while the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier strike group was in the Gulf of Oman.


Additional F-22 fighter jets have flown into the region, and the USS Wasp, a large amphibious assault ship carrying F-35 fighter jets, is in the Mediterranean Sea.

But to my mind, that wouldn’t be quite correct. There has been an undeniable change in the party’s <em><em>political </em></em>calculus at moments like this one, but it needn’t cause those who care about the issue to panic. </p><p>Every activist would like their issue to be at the top of the political agenda, but especially in our current state of polarization, that usually means a big fight, with high stakes and the chance of both victory and defeat. At the moment, abortion is the issue Democrats want to elevate into that kind of fight, since they believe it can be used to pull voters from the middle and even the other major party into their camp. Republicans believe the same thing about immigration. </p><p>Democrats may not believe climate change has the same kind of power in voters’ minds. But that may not be such a bad thing. </p><p>After all, starting a big fight on an issue is only one path to policy change. Another is to place it within a broader agenda, keeping the part of your coalition that cares about it on board and ready to move forward should you win, without generating too much energetic opposition from your opponents. And that’s what climate wound up being at the Democratic convention: not a main course, not even a side dish, but rather an appealing political crouton tossed into a salad full of other policies and priorities. </p><p>That’s partially a product of Democrats’ legislative success: The passage of the IRA may have encouraged them to place the climate issue somewhat to the side. Many in the party feel that they got away with passing a sweeping law without the kind of knock-down, drag-out battle we saw around something like the Affordable Care Act, another important bill that squeaked by without a vote to spare. The debate within Congress over the IRA may have been intense — remember all the <a href="https://www.vox.com/23281547/build-back-better-joe-manchin-inflation-reduction-act" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wrangling</u></a> over whether Joe Manchin would give his assent? — but most Americans barely noticed. It was too complicated and too fraught with dull procedural details. That’s one reason that today, <a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-in-the-american-mind-politics-policy-spring-2024/toc/7/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>most voters</u></a> say they haven’t heard much about the law (and some who claim they have are probably lying). Yet when its provisions are described to them, it garners overwhelming support. </p><p>In some ways, the IRA resembles the ACA, which Democrats <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/poll-finding/5-charts-about-public-opinion-on-the-affordable-care-act/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>correctly believed</u></a> would grow more popular as its effects were felt. In climate as in health care, Democrats don’t have much appetite for another big battle; they’d rather make incremental additions in future legislation that build on what they managed to put into law. And they hope the Republicans who tried to defeat the bills won’t want to take the political risk of unwinding them.</p><p>Kamala Harris’ slogan may be “When we fight, we win,” but she doesn’t seem to want too much of a fight on climate. Likewise, environmental groups are pouring millions of dollars into ads supporting her candidacy, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNYDKV9y6io" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>many of them</u></a> don’t actually focus on climate and mention “clean energy” only in passing. The people producing them have clearly calculated that what’s most important is not having their issue discussed in the campaign, but rather getting an administration that will allow the IRA and other laws with climate provisions such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to continue to unspool, while regulatory agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency keep working on reducing emissions. If those bills do what they’re supposed to, they’ll create their own constituencies and political armor. </p><p>And if most of the public takes only occasional notice at campaign time? There’s nothing wrong with that. Campaigns are almost always superficial, and this one isn’t any different. It’s what happens afterward that matters.</p>

## Chinese entities turn to Amazon cloud, rivals to access US chips, AI

date: 2024-08-23, from: VOA News USA

BEIJING/SINGAPORE/NEW YORK — State-linked Chinese entities are using cloud services provided by Amazon or its rivals to access advanced U.S. chips and artificial intelligence capabilities that they cannot acquire otherwise, recent public tender documents showed.


The U.S. government has restricted the export of high-end AI chips to China over the past two years, citing the need to limit the Chinese military's capabilities.


Providing access to such chips or advanced AI models through the cloud, however, is not a violation of U.S. regulations since only exports or transfers of a commodity, software or technology are regulated.


A Reuters review of more than 50 tender documents posted over the past year on publicly available Chinese databases showed that at least 11 Chinese entities have sought access to restricted U.S. technologies or cloud services.


Among those, four explicitly named Amazon Web Services, or AWS, as a cloud service provider, although they accessed the services through Chinese intermediary companies rather than from AWS directly.




The tender documents, which Reuters is the first to report on, show the breadth of strategies Chinese entities are employing to secure advanced computing power and access generative AI models. They also underscore how U.S. companies are capitalizing on China's growing demand for computing power.


"AWS complies with all applicable U.S. laws, including trade laws, regarding the provision of AWS services inside and outside of China," a spokesperson for Amazon's cloud business said.


AWS controls nearly a third of the global cloud infrastructure market, according to research firm Canalys. In China, AWS is the sixth-largest cloud service provider, according to research firm IDC.


Shenzhen University spent $27,996 (200,000 yuan) on an AWS account to gain access to cloud servers powered by Nvidia A100 and H100 chips for an unspecified project, according to a March tender document. It got this service via an intermediary, Yunda Technology Ltd Co, the document showed.


Exports to China of the two Nvidia chips that are used to power large-language models, or LLM, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, are banned by the United States.


Shenzhen University and Yunda Technology did not respond to requests for comment. Nvidia declined to comment on Shenzhen University's spending or on any of the other Chinese entities' deals.


Zhejiang Lab, a research institute developing its own LLM, called GeoGPT, said in a tender document in April that it intended to spend 184,000 yuan to purchase AWS cloud computing services as its AI model could not get enough computing power from homegrown Alibaba.


A spokesperson for Zhejiang Lab said that it did not follow through with the purchase but did not respond to questions about the reasoning behind this decision or how it met its LLM's computing power requirements. Alibaba's cloud unit, Alicloud, did not respond to a request for comment.


Reuters could not establish whether the purchase went ahead.


Moving to tighten access


The U.S. government is now trying to tighten regulations to restrict access through the cloud.




"This loophole has been a concern of mine for years, and we are long overdue to address it," Michael McCaul, chair of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, told Reuters in a statement, referring to the remote access of advanced U.S. computing through the cloud by foreign entities.


Legislation was introduced in Congress in April to empower the Commerce Department to regulate remote access of U.S. technology, but it is not clear if and when it will be passed.


A department spokesperson said it was working closely with Congress and "seeking additional resources to strengthen our existing controls that restrict PRC companies from accessing advanced AI chips through remote access to cloud computing capability."


The Commerce Department also proposed a rule in January that would require U.S. cloud computing services to verify large AI model users and report to regulators when they use U.S. cloud computing services to train large AI models capable of "malicious cyber-enabled activity."


The rule, which has not been finalized, would also enable the Commerce secretary to impose prohibitions on customers.


"We are aware the Commerce Department is considering new regulations, and we comply with all applicable laws in the countries in which we operate," the AWS spokesperson said.


Cloud demand in China


The Chinese entities are also seeking access to Microsoft's cloud services.


In April, Sichuan University said in a tender document it was building a generative AI platform and purchasing 40 million Microsoft Azure OpenAI tokens to support the delivery of this project. The university's procurement document in May showed that Sichuan Province Xuedong Technology Co Ltd supplied the tokens.


Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment. Sichuan University and Sichuan Province Xuedong Technology did not respond to requests for comment on the purchase.


OpenAI said in a statement that its own services are not supported in China and that Azure OpenAI operates under Microsoft's policies. It did not comment on the tenders.


The University of Science and Technology of China's Suzhou Institute of Advanced Research said in a tender document in March that it wanted to rent 500 cloud servers, each powered by eight Nvidia A100 chips, for an unspecified purpose.


The tender was fulfilled by Hefei Advanced Computing Center Operation Management Co Ltd, a procurement document showed in April, but the document did not name the cloud service provider. Reuters could not determine its identity.


The University of Science and Technology of China, or USTC, was added to a U.S. export control list known as the “Entity List” in May for acquiring U.S. technology for quantum computing that could help China's military, and for involvement in its nuclear program development.


USTC and Hefei Advanced Computing Center did not respond to requests for comment.


Beyond restricted AI chips


Amazon has offered Chinese organizations access not only to advanced AI chips but also to advanced AI models such as Anthropic's Claude, which they cannot otherwise access, according to public posts, tenders and marketing materials reviewed by Reuters.


"Bedrock provides a selection of leading LLMs, including prominent closed-source models such as Anthropic's Claude 3," Chu Ruisong, president of AWS Greater China, told a generative AI-themed conference in Shanghai in May, referring to its cloud platform.


In various Chinese-language posts for AWS developers and clients, Amazon highlighted the opportunity to try out "world-class AI models" and mentioned Chinese gaming firm Source Technology as one of its clients using Claude.


Amazon has dedicated sales teams serving Chinese clients domestically and overseas, according to two former company executives.


After Reuters contacted Amazon for comment, it updated dozens of posts on its Chinese-language channels with a note to say some of its services were not available in its China cloud regions. It also removed several promotional posts, including the one about Source Technology. Amazon did not give a reason for removing the posts and did not answer a Reuters query about that.


"Amazon Bedrock customers are subject to Anthropic's end user license agreement, which prohibits access to Claude in China both via Amazon's Bedrock API [application programming interface] and via Anthropic's own API," the AWS spokesperson said.


Anthropic said it does not support or allow customers or end-users within China to access Claude.


"However, subsidiaries or product divisions of Chinese-headquartered companies may use Claude if the subsidiary itself is located in a supported region outside of China," an Anthropic spokesperson said.


Source Technology did not respond to a request for comment.

## US national security adviser to hold talks with Chinese foreign minister

date: 2024-08-23, from: VOA News USA

Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, is heading to China next week for talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, according to a senior administration official.


The discussions are expected to include a potential meeting between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping later this year.




This would be Sullivan’s first trip to China as the White House national security adviser. The planned meetings, scheduled from August 27 through August 29, would also be the latest in a series of high-level diplomatic moves aimed at stabilizing U.S.-China relations.


In response to a VOA question, the senior administration official told reporters during Friday’s background briefing, "The purpose of this strategic level of communication” is to clear up “misperceptions and avoiding this competition from veering into conflict.”


The senior official also said the United States will raise concerns about China’s “increased military, diplomatic, and economic pressure against Taiwan” in next week’s talks. “These activities are destabilizing and risk escalation, and we're going to continue to urge Beijing to engage in meaningful dialogue with Taipei.”


Sullivan and Wang have met previously, in Bangkok, Malta and Vienna, to discuss broad and strategic issues facing the two countries.


Issues and agenda


Key issues in the U.S.-China relationship, including counter-narcotics cooperation, military-to-military communication, AI safety and risk management, are expected to be on the agenda for Sullivan’s talks with Wang.


These discussions follow China’s suspension of talks with the U.S. on nuclear safety and security. China said in July it had halted nascent arms-control talks with Washington.


“The United States remains open to developing and implementing concrete risk reduction measures with the PRC.  However, it requires a PRC willing to manage strategic risks,” a State Department spokesperson told VOA, referring to the People’s Republic of China.


“The U.S. would like to deepen discussions on strategic stability, but the Chinese are reluctant. They prefer to discuss an agreement on the no first use of nuclear weapons, but the United States is not prepared to adopt such a doctrine,” former CIA China analyst Dennis Wilder, now a Georgetown University professor, told VOA.


“As a result, there’s been a bit of an impasse, with little progress made in the few working group meetings that have occurred,” he said.


The militarization of space is another emerging concern shared by U.S. officials, who worry it could become the new frontier for warfare.  Wilder cited a report by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency that China and Russia are moving rapidly toward space warfare.


South China Sea


Another area of concern is China's activities in the South China Sea. On Monday, a collision between Chinese and Philippine coast guard vessels occurred near a disputed reef in the sea. The incident left a gaping hole in a Philippine coast guard vessel near Sabina Shoal.


Known as Xianbin Jiao in China, it lies within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, or EEZ, although China claims the partially submerged reef as part of its territory.




The nations have clashed over three shoals that lie within the Philippines EEZ but are claimed by China even though the claim has been rejected by an international tribunal.


In Beijing, Chinese officials accused the Philippine coast guard vessels of intruding into China’s “territory” without permission from the Chinese government.


In Washington, the United States expressed support for its ally, the Philippines.


"These actions are the latest examples of the PRC using dangerous and escalatory measures to enforce its expansive and unlawful South China Sea maritime claims," the State Department said in a statement on Monday.


Zack Cooper, a senior fellow at the Washington-based American Enterprise Institute, told VOA that he doubts the U.S.-China talks will make the disputes over the South China Sea go away.


“But the communications could provide clarity to Chinese policymakers that pressing Manila further will not force Washington to back down. In that way, high-level interactions could decrease the chance of a conflict erupting," Cooper said.


The Mideast


Next week’s talks come as the U.S. works with Qatar and Egypt to mediate a cease-fire and hostage release deal between Israel and the Hamas militant group.  

There is an increased urgency to reach an agreement amid fears of broader regional escalation if Iran and its Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, retaliate against Israel for the assassination of a top Hezbollah operative in Beirut and Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.


“I think there are some shared concerns about instability. But I think it's fair to say that two sides — the U.S. and China — approach the issue very differently,” the senior administration official told reporters Friday.


U.S. officials also said they want to hear directly from Chinese officials following China’s announcement in July that it had brokered reconciliation talks among representatives of 14 Palestinian factions. Rival Palestinian factions Fatah and Hamas are reported to have signed a declaration in Beijing to end years of discord and form a national unity government.


VOA White House bureau chief Patsy Widakuswara contributed to this story.

## Kamala Harris outlines her economic agenda

date: 2024-08-23, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris closed the Democratic National Convention last night with an acceptance speech that broadly laid out her priorities. On the dollars and cents side of things, she highlighted protecting Social Security and Medicare, addressing the housing shortage in this country and a tax cut for middle-income households. Plus, arbitration agreements have become increasingly more common buried in the terms and conditions for various apps and services.</p>

</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Kamala Harris only mentions climate change once in DNC acceptance speech</h3><p>
	The Democratic National Convention came to a close last night, culminating in a <a href="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2024/08/REMARKS-AS-PREPARED-FOR-DELIVERY-Vice-President-Harris-Acceptance-Speech.pdf?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9EbcRjuEc2WQ6A_xzNs4TdVp8-7yYen_Ar5qPQ72GqgrZ2ywYgOl5xLCFpEV6gN6iMyD98" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">speech</a> from presidential nominee Kamala Harris (but not, unfortunately, a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2024/08/23/beyonce-dnc-special-guest-kamala-harris/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9EbcRjuEc2WQ6A_xzNs4TdVp8-7yYen_Ar5qPQ72GqgrZ2ywYgOl5xLCFpEV6gN6iMyD98" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">surprise performance by Beyoncé </a>). Harris only mentioned climate change once in her speech, in a comment warning that “the freedom to breathe clean air, and drink clean water and live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis” are at stake in the November election. Going light on climate is certainly a deliberate strategic choice, one aimed at avoiding upsetting any voters in natural gas swing states like Pennsylvania. Some environmental advocates seem to be giving her a bit of a grace period, but <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-23/harris-was-largely-silent-last-night-on-climate-green-daily?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9EbcRjuEc2WQ6A_xzNs4TdVp8-7yYen_Ar5qPQ72GqgrZ2ywYgOl5xLCFpEV6gN6iMyD98" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pressure will build</a> as Election Day nears for her to outline in detail her climate and energy platforms.

The agency says dry air and Saharan dust have kept the Atlantic relatively quiet but that these conditions are lifting now. “With extremely warm water temperatures, less disruptive wind shear, and less dry air, we could see a storm organizing every few days,” said AccuWeather lead hurricane expert Alex DaSilva.

Of the 1,500 policies implemented across the globe since 1998, just 63 were found to reduce emissions, and only by 1.8 billion metric tons of CO2. That falls far short of the amount of emissions we need to eliminate by 2030 in order to meet targets set out in the Paris Agreement. So what’s working? “Most of those emissions reductions were tied to price instruments like changes in carbon prices, energy taxes and fossil-fuel-subsidy reforms,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/22/climate/climate-policies.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9EbcRjuEc2WQ6A_xzNs4TdVp8-7yYen_Ar5qPQ72GqgrZ2ywYgOl5xLCFpEV6gN6iMyD98" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a> <em><em>The New York Times</em></em>. “And most emissions reductions gained strength in numbers: They happened from the combination of multiple national policies, instead of just one stand-alone policy.”

## Tropical storm forecast to bring strong winds and heavy rain to Hawaii this weekend

date: 2024-08-23, from: VOA News USA

HONOLULU — A tropical storm is expected to deliver strong winds and heavy rain to Hawaii this weekend, particularly to the Big Island and Maui, as it passes south of the island chain.


The National Weather Service on Thursday evening issued a tropical storm watch for Hawaii County, which includes all of the Big Island, in anticipation of Tropical Storm Hone.


In an 8 p.m. advisory, the weather service said the storm was located about 770 miles (1,240 kilometers) east-southeast of Hilo and about 980 miles (1,575 kilometers) east-southeast of Honolulu. The storm was moving west at 14 mph (23 kph) with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph).


The August storm has evoked memories of the powerful hurricane south of Hawaii that helped fuel a deadly wildfire that destroyed Maui's Lahaina town last summer, but the weather service said Thursday that Hone was not creating the same conditions.


Separately, to Hone's east, Hurricane Gilma was moving west across the Pacific, but it was too early to tell whether it would affect the islands.


Hone, which means “sweet and soft” in Hawaiian and is pronounced hoe-NEH, was expected to bring sustained winds of 20 to 30 mph (32 to 48 kph) and gusts of 50 mph (80 mph) to Maui and the Big Island. Oahu and Kauai were forecast to get slightly weaker winds.


The Big Island's east coast and southeastern corner were expected to get 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters) of rain Saturday night through Sunday night. Maui could get 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) of rain.


These predictions could change depending on the storm's course. Late Thursday, the storm was about 815 miles (1,310 kilometers) east-southeast of Hilo. It was moving west at 16 mph (26 kph).


The Aug. 8, 2023, Lahaina fire was fueled by powerful winds whipped up by a combination of a hurricane passing some 500 miles (800 kilometers) to the south and a very strong high pressure system to the north of the islands. The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning at the time, something it does when warm temperatures, very low humidity and strong winds combine to raise fire danger.


Laura Farris, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Honolulu, said some drier air was expected to move in to the western end of the state this weekend, which presents some concerns about fire risk.


“But it’s not even close to what we saw last year,” Farris said.


The pressure system to the north is not as strong now as last year and the tropical system to the south is a storm not a hurricane, said Pao-Shin Chu, a University of Hawaii professor and the state’s climatologist.


“We do see something similar but not as dramatic as the Lahaina case we saw last year," Chu said.


Hurricane Gilma was packing maximum sustained winds near 120 mph (193 kph), making it a Category 3 hurricane. It was slowly moving west. The National Weather Service said Gilma was expected to slowly weaken this weekend.


The cause of Lahaina blaze, the deadliest in the United States in over a century, hasn’t been determined, but it's possible it was ignited by bare electrical wire and leaning power poles toppled by the strong winds.


To reduce the risk of wildfires, the state's electric utilities, Hawaiian Electric and the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative, have since started shutting off power during high winds and dry conditions.


Last year, Maui County officials failed to activate outdoor sirens that would have warned Lahaina's people of the approaching flames. They instead relied on a series of sometimes confusing social media posts that reached a much smaller audience.


Amos Lonokailua-Hewett, who took over as the new administrator of the Maui Emergency Management Agency on Jan. 1, said in the event of a wildfire threat, his agency would send alerts over radio and television broadcasts, via cellphones and with the sirens.


The sirens sound a steady tone and no message.


“The outdoor warning siren is typically used when there is an imminent threat to public safety and the situation requires the public to seek more information,” Lonokailua-Hewett said in an emailed statement.

## Fed Chief: 'The time has come' to begin reducing interest rates

date: 2024-08-23, from: VOA News USA

JACKSON HOLE, Wyoming — With inflation nearly defeated and the job market cooling, the Federal Reserve is prepared to start cutting its key interest rate from its current 23-year high, Chair Jerome Powell said Friday.


Powell did not say when rate cuts would begin or how large they might be, but the Fed is widely expected to announce a modest quarter-point cut in its benchmark rate when it meets in mid-September.


"The time has come for policy to adjust," Powell said in his keynote speech at the Fed's annual economic conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. "The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks."


His reference to multiple rate cuts was the only hint that a series of reductions is likely, as economists have forecast. Powell emphasized that inflation, after the worst price spike in four decades inflicted pain on millions of households, appears largely under control:


"My confidence has grown," he said, "that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2%."


According to the Fed's preferred measure, inflation fell to 2.5% last month, far below its peak of 7.1% two years ago and only slightly above the central bank's 2% target level.


The Fed chair also said that rate cuts should maintain the economy's growth and sustain hiring, which slowed last month. Continued growth could boost Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign, even as most Americans say they are dissatisfied with the Biden-Harris administration's economic record, largely because average prices remain far above where they were before the pandemic.


"We will do everything we can," Powell said, "to support a strong labor market as we make further progress toward price stability."


By cutting rates, he said, "there is good reason to think that the economy will get back to 2% inflation while maintaining a strong labor market."


A rate cut in mid-September, coming less than two months before the presidential election, could bring some unwelcome political heat on the Fed, which seeks to avoid becoming entangled in election-year politics. Former President Donald Trump has argued that the Fed shouldn't cut rates so close to an election. But Powell has repeatedly underscored that the central bank would make its rate decisions based purely on economic data, without regard to the political calendar.


In his remarks, Powell said the Fed is increasingly concerned about slower hiring and a rising unemployment rate, even while it still wants to see inflation fall further. That dual focus is replacing the Fed's previous singular focus on inflation.


"The cooling in labor market conditions is unmistakable," the Fed chair said. "Job gains remain solid but have slowed this year. ... We do not seek or welcome further cooling in labor market conditions."


In what amounted to something of a victory lap, Powell noted in his speech Friday that the Fed had succeeded in conquering high inflation without causing a recession or a sharp rise in the unemployment rate, which many economists had long predicted.


The Fed chair attributed that outcome to the unraveling of the pandemic's disruptions to supply chains and labor markets, and a reduction in job vacancies, which allowed wage growth to cool.


Powell also addressed criticism that the Fed was too slow to raise rates even as inflation had begun surging once the pandemic recession ended. Higher rates are intended to cool borrowing and spending, slow the economy and tame price increases.


Fed officials had initially argued that the price spikes coming out of the pandemic in early 2021 were merely "transitory" and would soon fade as the supply chain disruptions that left some grocery shelves bare and auto lots empty had healed.


Powell acknowledged that the healing of supply disruptions took much longer than the Fed had expected — and so did the persistence of high inflation.


"The good ship transitory was a crowded one, with most mainstream analysts and advanced-economy central bankers on board," Powell said. "I think I see some ship-mates out there today," he said, in an ad-libbed remark addressed to the economists and central banks assembled for the conference.


After the government reported this month that hiring in July was much less than expected and that the jobless rate reached 4.3%, the highest in three years, stock prices plunged for two days on fears that the U.S. might fall into a recession. Some economists began speculating about a half-point Fed rate cut in September and perhaps another identical cut in November.


But healthier economic reports last week, including another decline in inflation and a robust gain in retail sales, partly dispelled those concerns. Wall Street traders now expect the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter-point in both September and November and by a half-point in December. Mortgage rates have already started to decline in anticipation of rate reductions.


A half-point Fed rate cut in September would become more likely if there were signs of a further slowdown in hiring, some officials have said.

## CloudNativePG 1.24.0 and 1.23.4 Released!

date: 2024-08-23, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>The <strong>CloudNativePG Community</strong> is excited to announce the release of
<strong>CloudNativePG Operator</strong> versions 1.24.0 and 1.23.4!</p>
<h2>CloudNativePG 1.24.0: What’s New?</h2>
<p>This major update introduces powerful new features and enhancements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Distributed PostgreSQL Topologies</strong>: Create distributed database topologies
  across multiple Kubernetes clusters, enabling hybrid and multi-cloud
  deployments. Enjoy declarative primary control and seamless switchover between
  clusters, ensuring high availability and resilience.</li>
<li><strong>Managed Services</strong>: The new <code>managed.services</code> stanza allows for advanced
  service management, including the ability to disable read-only and read
  services via configuration, and the use of service templates to create custom
  service resources, such as load balancers, for accessing PostgreSQL outside
  Kubernetes—ideal for DBaaS scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Synchronous Replication API</strong>: Gain full control over PostgreSQL’s
  synchronous replication configuration with a more flexible API, supporting
  both quorum-based and priority list strategies. Customize the
  <code>synchronous_standby_names</code> option to suit your needs.</li>
<li><strong>WAL Disk Space Exhaustion Safeguard</strong>: A critical safety measure ensures
  that if disk space for WAL files is exhausted, the cluster will safely stop
  rather than triggering a chain of failovers. This prevents the cluster from
  entering an unrecoverable state and simplifies recovery by allowing for manual
  volume expansion.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a detailed overview of these features and other changes, check out the
<a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.24/release_notes/v1.24/">release notes</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Additional Enhancements in 1.24.0</h3>
<p>Explore more improvements in CloudNativePG 1.24, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Declarative delayed replicas</li>
<li>Transparent support for PostgreSQL 17’s <code>allow_alter_system</code></li>
<li><code>postInitSQLRefs</code> and <code>postInitTemplateSQLRefs</code></li>
<li>Observability enhancements</li>
</ul>
<p>Check the full list of changes in the
<a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.24/release_notes/v1.24/">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2>Upgrade and Maintenance</h2>
<p>Before upgrading, please carefully review the
<a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.24/installation_upgrade/#upgrading-to-1240-or-1234">detailed upgrade instructions</a>.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend upgrading to CloudNativePG 1.24.0 at your earliest
convenience. If you prefer to stay on version 1.23, be sure to update to 1.23.4
for continued stability and support. Note that version 1.23 will be supported
until November 22nd, 2024.</p>

<h2>About CloudNativePG</h2>
<p><a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io">CloudNativePG</a> stands as a groundbreaking
open-source Kubernetes Operator designed explicitly for PostgreSQL workloads.
Seamlessly orchestrating the entire life cycle of a PostgreSQL cluster,
CloudNativePG takes charge from bootstrapping and configuration to ensuring
high availability, connection routing, and comprehensive backup and disaster
recovery mechanisms.
Leveraging PostgreSQL's native streaming replication, CloudNativePG efficiently
distributes data across pods, nodes, and zones, utilizing standard Kubernetes
patterns. This enables seamless scaling of replicas in a Kubernetes-native
manner, with the operator autonomously and safely reconfiguring replication as
needed.
Originally conceived and supported by <a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/">EDB</a>,
CloudNativePG represents a paradigm shift in managing PostgreSQL workloads
within Kubernetes environments.</p>
