## Microsoft maintains its own Windows debloat scripts on GitHub

date: 2024-10-21, from: OS News

It&#8217;s no secret that a default Windows installation is&#8230; Hefty. In more ways than one, Windows is a bit on the obese side of the spectrum, from taking up a lot of disk space, to requiring hefty system requirements (artificial or not), to coming with a lot of stuff preinstalled not everyone wants to have to deal with. As such, there&#8217;s a huge cottage industry of applications, scripts, modified installers, custom ISOs, and more, that try to slim Windows down to a more manageable size. As it turns out, even Microsoft itself wants in on this action. The company that develops and sells Windows also provides a Windows debloat script. Over on GitHub, Microsoft maintains a repository of scripts simplify setting up Windows as a development environment, and amid the collection of scripts we find RemoveDefaultApps.ps1, a PowerShell script to &#8220;Uninstall unnecessary applications that come with Windows out of the box&#8221;. The script is about two years old, and as such it includes a few applications no longer part of Windows, but looking through the list is a sad reminder of the kind of junk Windows comes with, most notably mobile casino games for children like Bubble Witch and March of Empires, but also other nonsense like the Mixed Reality Portal or Duolingo. It also removes something called &#8220;ActiproSoftwareLLC&#8220;, which are apparently a set of third-party, non-Microsoft UI controls for WPF? Which comes preinstalled with Windows sometimes? What is even happening over there? The entire set of scripts makes use of Chocolatey wrapped in Boxstarter, which is &#8220;a wrapper for Chocolatey and includes features like managing reboots for you&#8221;, because of course, the people at Microsoft working on Windows can&#8217;t be bothered to fix application management and required reboots themselves. Silly me, expecting Microsoft&#8217;s Windows developers to address these shortcomings internally instead of using third-party tools. The repository seems to be mostly defunct, but the fact it even exists in the first place is such a damning indictment of the state of Windows. People keep telling us Windows is fine, but if even Microsoft itself needs to resort to scripts and third-party tools to make it usable, I find it hard to take claims of Windows being fine seriously in any way, shape, or form.

## Booting Sun SPARC servers

date: 2024-10-21, from: OS News

In early 2022 I got several Sun SPARC servers for free off of a FreeCycle ad: I was recently called out for not providing any sort of update on those devices… so here we go! ↫ Sidneys1.com Some information on booting old-style SPARC machines, as well as pretty pictures. Nice palate-cleanser if you&#8217;ve had to deal with something unpleasant this weekend. This world would be a better place if we all had our own Sun machines to play with when we get sad.

## Episode 143 - The Haunted Hard Drive

date: 2024-10-20, from: Advent of Computing

<p>Have you ever felt like a computer just refuses to work? Like a machine has a mind of it's own? In 1970 a hard drive at the National Farmers Union Corp. office decided to do just that. That year it started crashing for apparently no reason. It would take 2 years and 56 crashes to sort out the problem. The ultimate solution would leave more questions than answers. Was the hard drive haunted? Or was something else at play?</p> <p>Selected Sources:</p> <p><a href= "https://archive.org/details/computercrime0000mckn/page/98/mode/2up"> https://archive.org/details/computercrime0000mckn/page/98/mode/2up</a> - Computer Crime</p> <p><a href= "https://archive.org/details/sim_computerworld_1972-08-02_6_31/mode/1up?view=theater"> https://archive.org/details/sim_computerworld_1972-08-02_6_31/mode/1up?view=theater</a> - Computer World article</p>

Paul Frazee thread where he explains Blue Sky&#39;s philosophy of formats and user data. Illuminating. He says in one msg that they could have used HTTP and RSS. I wish they had. Could&#39;ve saved a lot of time and confusion. They still should do it. Huge potential adoption with devs.

The press has no power over Trump, he went around them going directly to the people through Twitter. Musk observed this, bought Twitter, for which his ROI will be huge. The Dems ignored this, and played the political game as if Twitter never happened. For Trump it was an accident, but not for Musk, he knew exactly what he was doing.

## What docs as code really means

date: 2024-10-20, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

<p>I’ve recently started a new job as a documentation engineer. While my work is largely the same as that of a technical writer, the sound and semantics of my new job title gave me some pause and made me think about what it really means to be doing docs-as-code. To say that it’s about writing documentation using the same tools and methods as software developers is correct, but fails to acknowledge the full consequences of the fact. Most descriptions of docs-as-code are naive because they stop at the implications of being developers’ attachés.</p>

## Sergey Durmanov opened issue #153: Compiler trap when compiling a call to {C} procedures (procedural variables) for the UnixARM platform at Felix Oliver Frie...

<p>This release is primarily a bugfix release the 9.8 series. These
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Significantly improve performance of code loading via dynamic linking (<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/23415">#23415</a>)</li>
<li>Fix a variety of miscompilations involving sub-word-size FFI arguments
(<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/25018">#25018</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24314">#24314</a>)</li>
<li>Fix a rare miscompilation by the x86 native code generator (<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24507">#24507</a>)</li>
<li>Improve runtime performance of some applications of <code>runRW#</code> (<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/25055">#25055</a>)</li>
<li>Reduce fragmentation when using the non-moving garbage collector (<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/23340">#23340</a>)</li>
<li>Fix source links in Haddock’s hyperlinked sources output (<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24086">#24086</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>A full accounting of changes can be found in the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/9.8.3/docs/users_guide/9.8.3-notes.html">release notes</a>. As
some of the fixed issues do affect correctness users are encouraged to
upgrade promptly.</p>
<p>We would like to thank Microsoft Azure, GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake pool,
Well-Typed, Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, Haskell Foundation, and
other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial and in-kind support has
facilitated GHC maintenance and release management over the years. Finally,
this release would not have been possible without the hundreds of open-source
contributors whose work comprise this release.</p>
<p>As always, do give this release a try and open a <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if you see
anything amiss.</p>
<p>Happy compiling!</p>
