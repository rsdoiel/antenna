I come bearing good news for a change: Most of the United States will
see reasonable summer temperatures this week! With, of course, a few
exceptions …
</p>
<h3>
Debby brings cooler days across the country
</h3>
<p>
Hurricane Debby, which first made landfall in Florida last Tuesday, has
set new weather trends in motion. After hitting Georgia and South
Carolina, the storm continued north, reaching the Northeast last Friday.
The wind and rainfall brought cooler, less humid air into the region,
Reneé Duff, senior meteorologist at Accuweather, told me.
<strong>Temperatures in the Northeast — which were several degrees below
historical averages this weekend — will continue to be more comfortable
this week compared to the recent past.</strong> Same goes for the
northern Plains and Midwest.
</p>
<p>
In the Southeast, where the hurricane has caused the most destruction,
temperatures will be near their historical averages — around the low 90s
degrees Fahrenheit. While the cool-off will be good for those trying to
recover after the storm, Duff told me that higher humidity levels with
rounds of showers and thunderstorms in the region may still end up
slowing cleanup efforts.
</p>

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
Despite Debby, the heat has found a way to stick itself to some states.
<strong>Parts of Texas and New Mexico will see temperatures much higher
than those expected for this time of the year</strong>, Tom Kines,
senior meteorologist at Accuweather, told me.<strong> </strong>During
the later part of the week, an intense heat wave will build across
Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, and Arkansas. On Thursday, southern
Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama will be under extreme heat risk
alerts, according to
<a href="https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/heatrisk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>data</u></a>
from the National Weather Service.<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
The rest of the country should “experience temperatures close to where
they should be for this time of year,” Kines told me.
</p>
<h3>
More updates on the Park Fire
</h3>
<p>
Little progress has been made on containing the Park Fire since last
week. <strong>The wildfire, which is now 38% contained, continues to
grow aggressively. </strong>Climate scientist Daniel Swain of the
University of California, Los Angeles, explained in a live briefing
Thursday that while parts of the fire that had been burning through
grass have been contained, in its northeastern flank, the fire is
currently ravaging through timber plantations which burn more violently
than natural forests. The fire has now also reached the Lassen National
Forest, burning over 100,000 acres of the protected area.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Some useful numbers:</strong> Ranking directly above the Park
Fire among the largest wildfires in California’s history (for the
moment) is the Mendocino Complex Fire of July 2018, which burned around
460,000 acres, but lasted
<a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2018/7/27/ranch-fire-mendocino-complex" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>161
days</u></a>. The Park Fire has already scorched almost 430,000 acres in
less than 20 days. The largest fire in California’s history was the 2020
August Complex fire, which devoured more than a million acres over 87
days.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There is one tiny bit of good news: According to
<a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2024/7/24/park-fire" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>updates</u></a>
from Cal Fire, <strong>firefighters have been able to lift evacuation
orders and warnings in Butte County</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, other wildfires have continued to pop up in California. On
Tuesday, the Crozier Fire started in El Dorado County, and almost 2,000
acres have so far been burned. While not as powerful as the Park Fire,
Crozier is also growing fast and in a more densely populated area, Swain
said.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> The heat wave in California has broken,
with near average — and maybe even lower — temperatures in store this
week. The only issue is that the cooler weather comes from stronger
winds, which are not ideal for containing a wildfire. <strong>Despite
more forgiving temperatures, wildfire risk will remain high in
California for the foreseeable future. </strong>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Alaska has been super weird
</h3>
<p>
In late July, an especially long and intense heat wave settled over
Alaska. On July 22, Fairbanks hit 90 degrees, breaking the previous
record of 89 set last year. <strong> On that day, it was hotter in
northern Alaska than it was in Atlanta.</strong>
</p>
<p>
The fact that such high temperatures are being seen so late into the
summer in Alaska is particularly concerning, Brian Brettschneider, a
climate scientist for the NWS,
<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/alaskan-heat-wave-will-send-temperatures-soaring-to-90-degrees-f/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told</u></a>
<em><em>Scientific American</em></em>. Peak temperatures usually happen
much sooner, in June; by July, after the summer solstice, Alaska gets
fewer hours of sunlight, so temperatures should start settling down.
Alaskans’ housing and habits are all adapted to keep the cold away, so
scientists are worried about the health risks of prolonged high
temperatures in the state.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> While temperatures in Alaska dipped
below average this weekend in the central and southern parts of the
state, the mercury will soon start rising again. <strong>“If there is
more record-breaking heat, the middle of the month would be the most
likely time frame,” Duff told me. </strong>The possibility of
record-breaking heat will decrease again starting at the end of August,
but temperatures will continue to be warmer than average in the northern
part of the state.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
A heat wave in South Korea is killing livestock by the thousands
</h3>
<p>
East Asian countries have been sizzling this summer, and South Korea is
no exception. Following the end of the monsoon season in late July,
Seoul has constantly seen temperatures of 89 degrees and up. Most of the
country has seen temperatures 10 degrees higher than historical
averages. <strong>The relentless heat has led to almost

heat-related illnesses and 17 fatalities</strong></u></a><strong> since
the start of the summer. </strong>In some regions, including Jeju,
people are struggling to keep livestock alive, for example using fans
and air conditioners to try to cool down the island’s rare black pigs.
Over
<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/south-korea-boils-in-summer-heat-that-may-set-new-records" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>300,000</u></a>
livestock have died since mid-July.
</p>
<p>
“The heat is mostly due to a persistent area of high pressure over the
Philippine Sea with the high’s axis reaching to the Korean Peninsula
over the past week to 10 days,” Duff explained.
</p>
<p>
The country has opened
<a href="https://crisis24.garda.com/alerts/2024/08/south-korea-high-temperatures-forecast-across-most-of-the-country-through-at-least-aug-19-update-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>50,000
cooling shelters</u></a> in response to the heat crisis, on top of
smaller-scale counter-measures such as distributing umbrellas and salt
tablets to try to keep people cool and hydrated.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Looking Ahead: Despite some cloudiness and rain this past
Friday, the scorching heat will prevail this week in the
country.</strong> “A better chance for relief from the heat may come
late next week or early the week of August 19,” Duff told me.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Extreme heat in northern Canada is making some miss the winter
</h3>
<p>
Several communities in northern Canada broke heat records last week.
Temperatures
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/08/canada-arctic-region-heat-wave" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reached</u></a>
95 degrees, breaking the record of 91 set last year. Inuvik, which saw
its second ever recorded heat wave this summer, has been especially
vulnerable to the recent heat. The region’s famous midnight sunsets
means heat takes longer to dissipate, exacerbating the issues with low
water levels in the Mackenzie River. Due to the dry and hot conditions,
the community so used to ice and snow is now concerned about wildfires.
Regions in Canada that have been historically shielded from major fire
threats have been in the line of destruction in recent years,
<em><em>The Guardian</em></em>
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/09/canada-wildfire-record-climate-crisis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> In Inuvik, temperatures will stay below
68 degrees for most of this week. While it seems like record-breaking
heat is now behind northern Canada, it’s harder to say when drought
conditions might improve. At least in the next 10 days, heavy
precipitation is not predicted for the Northwest Territories.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Research corner:
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Over 70% of the global workforce is at risk from extreme heat-related
death and injuries, according to a United Nations
<a href="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/unsg_call_to_action_on_extreme_heat_for_release.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>report</u></a>
— that’s almost 2.5 billion workers. While Africa leads as the region
with the highest percentage of vulnerable workers, the report also
points out that the number of those vulnerable in Europe is growing at
the fastest rate.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
In Montana, Missoula County first responders teamed up with researchers
at the University of Montana to investigate the most vulnerable group to
extreme heat. After going through 911 calls, they
<a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2024/08/07/rural-seniors-heat-wave-montana/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>found</u></a>
that those living in rural areas — which also tends to have older
populations — were the ones that required most assistance during periods
of intense heat. They also found that every 1 degree Celsius increase in
average daily temperatures led to a 1% increase in 911 activity,
i.e. hundreds of additional distress calls.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
A
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/electricity-bill-air-conditioning-64f1d13bbb6d3523a6cc31d0b4fb14af" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poll</a>
from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed
that seven in 10 Americans have seen the impact of extreme heat on their
electricity bills in the past year. In the past five years, according to
the survey, 70% of Americans have been personally affected by extreme
heat. Those in the West and South were more likely to report having been
impacted by the hot weather than those in the Northeast.

<h2 id="serving-bare-git-on-the-web">2024-08-11 Serving bare git on the

<p>date: 2024-08-12, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-08-11-serving-bare-git-on-the-web">
2024-08-11 Serving bare git on the web
</h1>
<p>
In the old days, I used <code>cgit</code> to render my git repositories
on the web. It’s simple to set up since it’s a CGI script. This is ideal
for URLs that get very few hits. When nobody is requesting the URL, the
CGI script isn’t running and no resources are being used. When a URL is
requested, however, the CGI script loads, the interpreter loads, the
libraries load, the script executes… It’s an expensive end-point! And
you know how it is. The web is full of leeches and bad bots, crawlers
and idiots. Having an expensive end-point means it needs protection.
</p>
<p>
For I while I thought that <code>legit</code> was the answer. It was
nice and fast and all that. But recently, <code>git clone</code> no
longer worked. It calls <code>git upload-pack</code> as an intermediate
workaround for
<a href="https://github.com/go-git/go-git/issues/1062">#1062</a>. This
was failing for some reason, however. I tinkered with it for a while but
didn’t get anywhere.
</p>
<p>
Then I started thinking about
<a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Sandra">@Sandra</span></a>’s post on
<a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/hosting-git-repos">hosting git
repos</a>. I made some changes to my Apache config and now <code>git
clone</code> works again.
</p>
<p>
The key is that you need a <code>post-update</code> hook that calls
<code>git update-server-info</code>. Each git repository already comes
with a <code>post-update.sample</code> hook containing the necessary
code, so I needed to loop over all the bare repositories I had and
rename the example hook.
</p>
<p>
Using the Fish shell:
</p>
<pre><code>for d in *.git
    sudo -u git mv $d/hooks/post-update.sample $d/hooks/post-update
end
</code></pre>
<p>
Sadly, this is not good enough.
</p>
<p>
In order to generate an <code>index.html</code> file for every
repository, I need a hook that regenerates it. If you know how to
determine whether regeneration can be skipped, I’d love to hear how to
that.
</p>
<p>
This hook also updates or adds the <code>AddDescription</code> lines I
need.
</p>
<p>
I prepared a hook that I wanted to install in every repository and saved
it as <code>~/post-update</code>.
</p>
<p>
This is what it looks like, using the Fish shell:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish

git update-server-info

# create index.html
set branch (git branch --show-current)
set template (cat /home/git/.readme.html | string collect)
set title (basename (pwd))
set body (git show $branch:README.md | cmark --to html | string collect)
printf &quot;$template&quot; &quot;$title&quot; &quot;$body&quot; &quot;$title&quot; &gt; index.html

# update description
set description (cat description)
sed --in-place=~ --expression &quot;/ $title/d&quot; /home/git/.htaccess
printf &quot;AddDescription \&quot;$description\&quot; $title\n&quot; &gt;&gt; /home/git/.htaccess
</code></pre>
<p>
(I need the title twice, once for the title and once for the reminder on
how to clone.)
</p>
<p>
I turn Markdown into HTML using <code>cmark</code>. Common Mark is the
closest we have to a standard, I guess.
</p>
<p>
The template <code>/home/git/.readme.html</code> looks like this:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;format-detection&quot; content=&quot;telephone=no&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;%s&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
html { max-width: 70ch; padding: 1ch; margin: auto; }
body { hyphens: auto; }
    &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;nav&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://src.alexschroeder.ch/&quot;&gt;Source code repositories&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/nav&gt;
    &lt;main&gt;
%s&lt;/main&gt;
    &lt;footer&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Clone&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;pre&gt;
&lt;mark&gt;git clone https://src.alexschroeder.ch/%s&lt;/mark&gt;
      &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/footer&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
So now I needed to distribute the <code>post-update</code> hook to every
repository and run it once. I wrote yet another Fish script,
<code>~/recreate-index</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
for d in /home/git/*.git
    echo $d
    cd $d
    cp ~/post-update hooks/
    chown git:git hooks/post-update
    chmod 775 hooks/post-update
    sudo -u git git hook run post-update
end
</code></pre>
<p>
I’m currently hosting 95 repositories according to <code>ls -d
/home/git/*.git | wc -l</code>. Some of these don’t have a
<code>README.md</code> file. Should I ever touch them again, I’ll have
to investigate.
</p>
<p>
Now, for the Apache web server – I changed my site to the following:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:443&gt;
    ServerAdmin alex@alexschroeder.ch
    ServerName src.alexschroeder.ch
    Include conf-enabled/blocklist.conf
    SSLEngine on
    DocumentRoot /home/git
   &lt;Directory /home/git&gt;
        Options Indexes
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
The <code>/home/git</code> directory has an <code>.htaccess</code> file
that starts out containing the following:
</p>
<pre><code>HeaderName .top.html
IndexOptions SuppressIcon SuppressSize FancyIndexing HTMLTable
IndexOrderDefault Descending Date
</code></pre>
<p>
The <code>.top.html</code> file contains a fragment to add to the top of
the index:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
body { max-width: 80ch }
td { padding: 0.5ex 1em 0 0; white-space: nowrap; overflow-x: auto }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Source code repositories&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Hello!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I'm Alex Schroeder.
  These are my source code repositories. You can find out more about me on
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexschroeder.ch/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;. There, you'll also find a page
  listing ways to &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexschroeder.ch/view/Contact&quot;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As for the git repositories, you should be able to clone them as they are.
  For example:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
  git clone https://src.alexschroeder.ch/oddmu.git
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  For more about this setup, see
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://idiomdrottning.org/hosting-git-repos&quot;&gt;How to host git repos&lt;/a&gt;

<strong>2024-08-12</strong>. I wondered about links from the README to
local files. Right now, linking to images and files hosted in the same
repository doesn’t work since they don’t exist in the raw repository.
The question then becomes, as far as I am concerned, whether this README
is supposed to speak to developers or end-users? If it is for
developers, then pictures, screenshots, PDF files and all of that don’t
need to be linked from the repository. If you are interested in these
things, do a <code>git clone –depth 1</code> and investigate locally.
</p>
<p>
If the repository is for the end users, however, things are harder. The
<code>post-update</code> hook should extract all the local files linked
to from the README. Something like the following, perhaps:
</p>
<pre><code>for file in (printf &quot;%s\n&quot; $body | /home/oddmu/oddmu links - | egrep -v '^(https?:|mailto:|/)')
    set dir (dirname $file)
    if test ! -d $dir
        mkdir -p $dir
    end
    echo $file; sudo -u git git show $branch:$file &gt; $file
end
</code></pre>
<p>
This uses <a href="oddmu">oddmu</a> to extract the links from a Markdown
file, creates the necessary directories and checks out the files.
</p>
<p>
But if the files are no longer linked from the README, they are not
deleted. If a directory is linked from the README (I have done this!
🤦), the checkout won’t work.
</p>
<p>
I think the better way forward is to move this information elsewhere.
The README is not the documentation.
</p>
<p>
And with that, I think I did it! Serving git repositories from static
files. A single directory per project containing the bare git data and a
single <code>index.html</code> file. No more gazillion end points for
crawlers to lose themselves.

delays are a $1.3 billion lithium refinery in South Carolina, a $1

combination of factors, including overproduction of clean tech from
China, macroeconomic pressures, policy confusion, and a drop in EV

This year’s COP29 global climate summit in Azerbaijan is expected to

anything into a solar surface. “We can envisage perovskite coatings
being applied to broader types of surfaces to generate cheap solar
power, such as the roofs of cars and buildings and even the backs of
mobile phones,” said Dr. Junke Wang, a Marie Skłodowska Curie Actions
Postdoc Fellow at Oxford University Physics. “If more solar energy can
be generated in this way, we can foresee less need in the longer term to
use silicon panels or build more and more solar farms.”

id="from-paris-to-los-angeles-how-the-city-is-preparing-for-the-2028-olympics">From
Paris to Los Angeles: How the city is preparing for the 2028
Olympics</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — It’s Los Angeles’ turn for the torch. Mayor Karen Bass
accepted the Olympic flag at the Paris closing ceremony Sunday, before
handing it off to a key representative of LA’s local business — Tom
Cruise — who in a pre-recorded trek via motorcycle, plane and parachute
kicked off the countdown to 2028.</p>
<p>The city will become the third in the world to host the games three
times as it adds to the storied years of 1932 and 1984. Here’s a look
forward and back in time at the Olympics in LA.</p>
<p>LA’s Olympic trilogy</p>
<p>Los Angeles got the 2028 games as a consolation prize when Paris was
picked for 2024.</p>
<p>Back in 1932, LA hosted its first Olympics. The city was the only
bidder for the games at a time marred by the Great Depression and the
absence of several nations. Yet memorable sport moments came from
athletes including American athlete Babe Didrikson Zaharias, who won
golds in the new women’s events of javelin and hurdles.</p>
<p>Financial and cultural success gave 1984 a reputation as the “good”
Olympics” which made seemingly every major world city want their
own.</p>
<p>Emphasizing both the modern and the classical with a hand from
Hollywood, the games opened with decathlon champion Rafer Johnson
lighting the torch, a guy in a jetpack descending into the Memorial
Coliseum and theme music by “Star Wars” maestro John Williams.</p>
<p>With Eastern Bloc countries boycotting, the U.S. dominated. Carl
Lewis and Mary Lou Retton are among the athletes who became household
names. A young Michael Jordan led the men’s basketball team to gold.</p>
<p>The games renewed, for a while, the global reputation of a city that
had been perceived to be in decline.</p>
<p>“We want our games to be a modern games, youthful, full of the
optimism that Southern California brings to the world and the globe,”
Janet Evans, four-time Olympic gold medalist in swimming and chief
athlete officer for the LA 2028 organizing committee, told The
Associated Press in Paris.</p>
<p>Passing the torch</p>
<p>Bass, who arrives back in LA Monday, spent these games in Paris along
with organizers and city officials, learning what it takes to host the
world’s largest sporting event.</p>
<p>Joining her were LA28 Chairperson Casey Wasserman, an entertainment
executive, and LA councilmember Traci Park, chair of the city Olympic
committee.</p>
<p>“As we’ve seen here in Paris, the Olympics are an opportunity to make
transformative change,” Bass said at a press conference ahead of the
closing ceremony.</p>
<p>Venues old and new, plus a swimming stadium</p>
<p>Amid a stadium-and-arena boom, LA will polish existing structures
rather than erect new ones.</p>
<p>“It’s a no-build games,” Evans said.</p>
<p>After Paris’ innovative opening ceremony on the Seine River, LA plans
to open with a traditional, stadium-based approach at SoFi Stadium in
neighboring Inglewood that also incorporates the century-old Memorial
Coliseum in Los Angeles itself.</p>
<p>Home to two NFL teams, SoFi has hosted a Super Bowl and several
Taylor Swift concerts since opening in 2020. It will become what
organizers say is the largest Olympic swimming venue ever. Its opening
ceremony role means swimming will come after track and field for the
first time since 1972.</p>
<p>Intuit Dome, the soon-to-open Inglewood home of the NBA’s Clippers,
would be the games’ newest major venue and is the planned home for
Olympic basketball. The Lakers’ downtown Crypto.com Arena will host
gymnastics.</p>
<p>The toxicity of swimming in the Seine became a serious issue in
Paris. That could put renewed focus on the Long Beach area waterfront
when it hosts marathon swimming and triathlon races. Its cleanliness
history is mixed but its ocean waters got consistently high marks in a
2023 analysis by nonprofit Heal the Bay.</p>
<p>The Long Beach shore was home to the pre-recorded performances during
Sunday’s ceremony of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Billie Eilish, Snoop
Dogg and Dr. Dre, though it was easy to mistake for LA’s Venice Beach,
where the journey of the flag begun by Cruise was shown ending moments
earlier.</p>
<p>Trains, buses and traffic</p>
<p>A city that’s notoriously hard to traverse may seem like an odd fit
for the Olympics, but it can work.</p>
<p>Bass said she plans to emulate the tactics of Tom Bradley, the mayor
in 1984, whose traffic mitigations had some saying it was better than at
non-Olympic times. They include asking local businesses to stagger
workforce hours to reduce the number of cars on the road and allow work
from home during the 17-day games.</p>
<p>Landing the Olympics under then-Mayor Eric Garcetti in 2017 gave the
city an unusually long lead time for planning.</p>
<p>While it’s no Paris Metro, LA has built a subway since its last
Olympics, with lines running past major venues.</p>
<p>In 2018, the city planned an ambitious slate of 28 bus and rail
projects to transform public transit. Some were scrapped but others
moved forward, including the extension of a subway line to connect
downtown Los Angeles with UCLA, the planned home of the Olympic
Village.</p>
<p>Another high-profile project is the Inglewood People Mover, an
automated, three-stop rail line past major Olympic venues. It initially
received a commitment of $1 billion in federal funding, but opposition
from Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters led to a $200 million reduction, the
Los Angeles Times reported. It’s unclear whether the line will be
completed by 2028.</p>
<p>Metro recently received $900 million in funding through an
infrastructure spending package and grants from the Biden
administration, of which $139 million will go directly toward improving
transportation by 2028 and the goal of a “car-free” Olympics.</p>
<p>“The biggest challenge is not waiting to 2028, but really taking the
opportunity between now and 2028 to help Angelenos and visitors alike
reimagine the transportation network as something that will be their
first choice,” Metro CEO Stephanie Wiggins said.</p>
<p>Crime, safety and perception</p>
<p>While crime rates were considerably higher in 1984 than today, the
countdown to 2028 comes as the issue has gotten increased attention and
cast a social-media-amplified shadow.</p>
<p>The Olympics are designated as a national special security event,
which makes the U.S. Secret Service the lead agency tasked with
developing a security plan, supported by significant federal
resources.</p>
<p>LA city and county law enforcement sent officers to Paris to observe,
learn and assist as they prepare for their own 2028 games.</p>
<p>There are many more encampments on city streets than there were in
1984, and it’s unlikely LA will have solved its homeless crisis in the
next four years. As the Paris games ended, California Gov. Gavin Newsom
threatened to withhold funding from cities unable to clear
encampments.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Games in Paris, organizers relocated thousands of
unhoused people, a practice also used for the 2016 Rio de Janiero games
and criticized by activists as “social cleansing.”</p>
<p>Tourists and finances</p>
<p>LA is the “next logical destination” for the Olympics, said Adam
Burke, president and CEO of the LA Tourism and Convention Board. “LA has
emerged as really one of the world’s sports capitals.”</p>
<p>First though, the city will host a FIFA World Cup event and U.S.
Women’s Open in 2026 and another Super Bowl in 2027.</p>
<p>The city’s hotel industry has continued to see growth, adding 9,000
new hotel rooms in the past four years with more to come over the next
four.</p>
<p>LA28 organizers are banking on ticket sales, sponsorships, payments
from the International Olympic Committee and other revenue streams to
cover the games’ $6.9 billion budget. The committee has brought in just
over $1 billion toward a goal of $2.5 billion in domestic corporate
sponsorships.</p>

id="americans-refusal-to-keep-paying-higher-prices-may-be-dealing-a-final-blow-to-us-inflation-spike">Americans’
refusal to keep paying higher prices may be dealing a final blow to US
inflation spike</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The great inflation spike of the past three years is
nearly spent — and economists credit American consumers for helping slay
it.</p>
<p>Some of America’s largest companies, from Amazon to Disney to Yum
Brands, say their customers are increasingly seeking cheaper alternative
products and services, searching for bargains or just avoiding items
they deem too expensive. Consumers aren’t cutting back enough to cause
an economic downturn. Rather, economists say, they appear to be
returning to pre-pandemic norms, when most companies felt they couldn’t
raise prices very much without losing business.</p>
<p>“While inflation is down, prices are still high, and I think
consumers have gotten to the point where they’re just not accepting it,”
Tom Barkin, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said last
week at a conference of business economists. “And that’s what you want:
The solution to high prices is high prices.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A more price-sensitive consumer helps explain why inflation has
appeared to be steadily falling toward the Federal Reserve’s 2% target,
ending a period of painfully high prices that strained many people’s
budgets and darkened their outlooks on the economy. It also assumed a
central place in the presidential election, with inflation leading many
Americans to turn sour on the Biden-Harris administration’s handling of
the economy.</p>
<p>The reluctance of consumers to keep paying more has forced companies
to slow their price increases — or even to cut them. The result is a
cooling of inflation pressures.</p>
<p>Other factors have also helped tame inflation, including the healing
of supply chains, which has boosted the availability of cars, trucks,
meats and furniture, among other items, and the high interest rates
engineered by the Fed, which slowed sales of homes, cars and appliances
and other interest rate-sensitive purchases.</p>
<p>Still, a key question now is whether shoppers will pull back so much
as to put the economy at risk. Consumer spending makes up more than
two-thirds of economic activity. With evidence emerging that the job
market is cooling, a drop in spending could potentially derail the
economy. Such fears caused stock prices to plummet a week ago, though
markets have since rebounded.</p>
<p>This week, the government will provide updates on both inflation and
the health of the American consumer. On Wednesday, it will release the
consumer price index for July. It’s expected to show that prices —
excluding volatile food and energy costs — rose just 3.2% from a year
earlier. That would be down from 3.3% in June and would be the lowest
such year-over-year inflation figure since April 2021.</p>
<p>And on Thursday, the government will report last month’s retail
sales, which are expected to have climbed a decent 0.3% from June. Such
a gain would suggest that while Americans have become vigilant about
their money, they are still willing to spend.</p>
<p>Many businesses have noticed.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing lower average selling prices … right now because
customers continue to trade down on price when they can,” said Andrew
Jassy, CEO of Amazon.</p>
<p>David Gibbs, CEO of Yum Brands, which owns Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza
Hut, told investors that a more cost-conscious consumer has slowed its
sales, which slipped 1% in the April-June quarter at stores open for at
least a year.</p>
<p>“Ensuring we provide consumers affordable options,” Gibbs said, “has
been an area of greater focus for us since last year.”</p>
<p>Other companies are cutting prices outright. Dormify, an online
retailer that sells dorm supplies, is offering comforters starting at
$69, down from $99 a year ago.</p>
<p>According to the Fed’s “Beige Book,” an anecdotal collection of
business reports from around the country that is released eight times a
year, companies in nearly all 12 Fed districts have described similar
experiences.</p>
<p>“Almost every district mentioned retailers discounting items or
price-sensitive consumers only purchasing essentials, trading down in
quality, buying fewer items or shopping around for the best deals,” the
Beige Book said last month.</p>
<p>Most economists say consumers are still spending enough to sustain
the economy consistently. Barkin said most of the businesses in his
district — which covers Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland and North and
South Carolina — report that demand remains solid, at least at the right
price.</p>
<p>“The way I’d put it is, consumers are still spending, but they’re
choosing,” Barkin said.</p>
<p>In a speech a couple of weeks ago, Jared Bernstein, who leads the
Biden administration’s Council of Economic Advisers, mentioned consumer
caution as a reason why inflation is nearing the end of a “round trip”
back to the Fed’s 2% target level.</p>
<p>Emerging from the pandemic, Bernstein noted, consumers were flush
with cash after receiving several rounds of stimulus checks and having
slashed their spending on in-person services. Their improved finances
“gave certain firms the ability to flex a pricing power that was much
less prevalent pre-pandemic.” After COVID, consumers were “less
responsive to price increases,” Bernstein said.</p>
<p>As a result, “the old adage that the cure for high prices is high
prices [was] temporarily disengaged,” Bernstein said.</p>
<p>So some companies raised prices even more than was needed to cover
their higher input costs, thereby boosting their profits. Limited
competition in some industries, Bernstein added, made it easier for
companies to charge more.</p>
<p>Barkin noted that before the pandemic, inflation remained low as
online shopping, which makes price comparisons easy, became increasingly
prevalent. Major retailers also held down costs, and increased U.S. oil
production brought down gas prices.</p>
<p>“A price increase was so rare,” Barkin said, “that if someone came to
you with a 5% or 10% price increase, you almost just threw them out,
like, ‘How could you possibly do it?’”</p>
<p>That changed in 2021.</p>
<p>“There are labor shortages, Barkin said. “Supply chain shortages. And
the price increases are coming to you from everywhere. Your gardener is
raising your prices, and you don’t have the capacity to do anything
other than accept them.”</p>
<p>The economist Isabella Weber at the University of Massachusetts,
Amherst, dubbed this phenomenon “sellers’ inflation” in 2023. In an
influential paper, she wrote that “publicly reported supply chain
bottlenecks” can “create legitimacy for price hikes” and “create
acceptance on the part of consumers to pay higher prices.”</p>
<p>Consumers are no longer so accepting, Barkin said.</p>
<p>“People have a little bit more time to stop and say, ‘How do I feel
about paying $9.89 for a 12-pack of Diet Coke when I used to pay $5.99?’
They don’t like it that much, and so people are making choices.”</p>
<p>Barkin said he expects this trend to continue to slow price increases
and cool inflation.</p>
<p>“I’m actually pretty optimistic that over the next few months, we’re
going to see good readings on the inflation side,” he said. “All the
elements of inflation seem to be settling down.”</p>

id="harris-is-pushing-joy.-trump-paints-a-darker-picture.-will-moods-matter">Harris
is pushing joy. Trump paints a darker picture. Will moods matter?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — At the top of his first speech as her running mate,
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz turned to Vice President Kamala Harris and
declared, “Thank you for bringing back the joy.” The next day, Harris
took the theme a step further, branding the Democratic ticket “joyful
warriors.”</p>
<p>Contrast that with former President Donald Trump, who opened a news
conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida a few days later by saying,
“We have a lot of bad things coming up,” and predicting the U.S. could
fall into an economic depression unseen since the dark days of 1929 or
even another world war.</p>
<p>“I think that our country is, right now, in the most dangerous
position it’s ever been in, from an economic standpoint, from a safety
standpoint,” Trump said Thursday.</p>
<p>Democrats are playing up their sunnier outlook, promoting the idea
that voters can be inspired to support someone and not just cast their
ballot against the other side. The Trump campaign argues their candidate
is reflecting the dour mood of the country and dismisses the idea that a
growing contrast in tone and upbeat attitude will decide the
presidency.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of Americans reported feeling very or somewhat pessimistic
about the state of politics, according to polling by The Associated
Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research from last month. Roughly 7
in 10 said things in the country are heading in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Jason Miller, a senior adviser to the former president, said people
don’t care about “vibe checks.”</p>
<p>“That’s not making gas or food or housing less expensive,” Miller
said.</p>
<p>Walz promotes positivity</p>
<p>Still, just how hard Harris is betting on the opposite approach is
evident in her decision to pick Walz, whose personal story includes
being on the coaching staff of a high school football team that had gone
winless just a few years earlier to clinching a state championship in
1999.</p>
<p>The Minnesota governor’s relentless positivity is meant to give
supporters a jolt of new energy and keep the momentum that Harris has
built after President Joe Biden — facing mounting pressure from within
his own party and increasingly pessimistic views about his chances in
November — stepped aside and endorsed his vice president.</p>
<p>Walz spent his first week as Harris’ running mate traveling to swing
states with Harris and underscored the point during a rally in Eau
Claire, Wisconsin, celebrating what he said was “the ability to talk
about what can be good.”</p>
<p>“This idea of caring for our neighbor and kindness, and a hand up
when somebody needs it. And just the sense that people go through things
and to be able to be there when they need it, that’s who we are,” he
said. “It’s not about mocking. It’s not name-calling.”</p>
<p>Biden often ended his speeches saying he’d never been more
optimistic. But he built his now-shuttered reelection bid around
branding Trump an existential threat to democracy. The president offered
dire predictions about the former president, suggesting he’d dismantle
the nation’s founding principles should he retake the White House.</p>
<p>Harris’ campaign still relies on many of the same themes, decrying
Trump as a threat to democracy, warning that he’ll impose draconian
limits to abortion and voting and that he will follow Project 2025, a
plan championed by top conservatives to remake large swaths of the
federal government.</p>
<p>And despite Walz insisting that smiles were more powerful than
insults, he and Harris have continued their share of denunciations,
decrying Trump’s conviction in New York on 34 felony counts in a
hush-money case and his being found liable for fraudulent business
practices and sexual abuse in civil court.</p>
<p>Still, even before she named Walz her running mate, Harris was
suggesting that she could help make politics fun again.</p>
<p>“We love our country. And I believe it is the highest form of
patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country,” Harris declared in
campaign speeches before picking Walz. She now tells crowds that she and
her running mate “both believe in lifting people up, not knocking them
down.”</p>
<p>Paula Montagna, who went to see Harris and Walz at a rally outside
Detroit last week, highlighted the shift in messaging since Harris took
over from Biden.</p>
<p>“Kamala is so positive, and it’s nice to hear positive instead of
negative,” Montagna said.</p>
<p>Trump team says their candidate is reflecting reality</p>
<p>Trump’s senior campaign advisers counter that the mood of the country
right now is sour over the economy, the state of the U.S.-Mexico border
and turmoil in the Middle East and beyond. They see their candidate as
reflecting that reality rather than what they believe is a temporary
exuberance igniting the Democratic base after months of discouragement
over their ticket.</p>
<p>Trump has tried to harness that with his repeated predictions of
stock market crashes and war. His campaign appearances have included a
long list of other warnings that have veered into the apocalyptic,
saying that if he’s not elected, “we’re not going to have a country
anymore,” that “the only thing standing between you and its obliteration
is me,” and that under a Harris administration, “Social Security will
buckle and collapse” and “the suburbs will be overrun with violent crime
and savage foreign gangs.”</p>
<p>During his Republican National Convention speech last month, where
his advisers said Trump would seem changed and more personal after
surviving an attempted assassination, the former president did strike a
different tone — at least to start.</p>
<p>He said early on that he had “a message of confidence, strength and
hope” and sought to “launch a new era of safety, prosperity and freedom
for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed.”</p>
<p>But by the end, Trump had returned to predictions of doom, twice
warning, “Bad things are going to happen.”</p>
<p>Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, has drawn a sharp contrast
with Walz. Vance has been cheered on the right for being an aggressive
fighter on behalf of the former president, particularly when engaging
with reporters.</p>
<p>“Right now, I am angry about what Kamala Harris has done to this
country and done to the American southern border,” Vance said at a
campaign stop in Michigan. “And I think most people in our country, they
can be happy-go-lucky sometimes, they can enjoy things sometimes, and
they can turn on the news and recognize that what’s going on in this
country is a disgrace.”</p>
<p>Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, not himself known for a
sunny disposition, offered much the same assessment Friday at a
conservative conference in Atlanta hosted by radio host Erick
Erickson.</p>
<p>“The country is obviously in a bad mood,” McConnell said.</p>
<p>Trump supporters waiting to see him at a rally in Bozeman, Montana,
said they felt the former president’s campaign made them feel positive —
even if his message often isn’t.</p>
<p>“Just looking at the state of the country now, I don’t think Kamala
Harris’ campaign is one of joy and hope. I think that’s Trump’s
campaign,” said Alex Lustig, a 23-year-old from Billings, Montana.</p>
<p>Fred Scarlett, a 63-year-old retiree from Condon, Montana, said that
“everyone understands that we need to be here to support Trump because
he has never let us down.”</p>
<p>“They shoot at him,” Scarlett said, “and he still keeps firing
back.”</p>

whenever Nova is mentioned online, people point out what kind of company
acquired Nova and that you probably should be looking for an
alternative. While Branch claimed, as the acquiring party always does,
that nothing was going to change, most people, including myself, were
skeptical. Several decades covering this industry have taught me that
acquisitions like this pretty much exclusively mean doom, and usually
signal a slow but steady decline in quality and corresponding increase
in user-hostile features. I’m always open to being proven wrong, but I
don’t have a lot of hope. ↫ Thom Holwerda Up until a few days ago, I
have to admit I was wrong. Nova remained largely the same, got some
major new features, and it really didn’t get any worse in any meaningful
way – in fact, Nova just continued to get better, adopted all the new
Android Material You and other features, and kept communicating with its
users quite well. After a while, I kind of forgot all about Nova being
owned by Branch, as nothing really changed for the worse. It’s rare, but
it happens – apparently. So I, and many others who were skeptical at
first as well, kept on using Nova. Not only because it just continued
being what I think is the best, most advanced, and most feature-rich
launcher for Android, but also because… Well, there’s really nothing
else out there quite like Nova. I’m sure many of you are already firing
up the comment engine, but as someone who has always been fascinated by
alternative, non-stock mobile device launchers – from Palm OS, PocketPC,
and Zaurus, all the way to the modern day with Android – I’ve seen them
all and tried them all, and while the launcher landscape is varied,
abundant, and full of absolutely amazing alternatives for every possible
kind of user, there’s nothing else out there that is as polished,
feature-rich, fast, and endlessly tweakable as Nova. So, I’ve been
continuing to use Nova since the acquisition, interchanged with Google’s
own Pixel Launcher ever since I bought a Pixel 8 Pro on release, with
Nova’s ownership status relegated to some dusty, barely used croft of my
mind. As such, it came as a bit of a shock this week when it came out
that Branch had done a massive round of lay-offs, including firing the
entire Nova Launcher team, save for Nova’s original creator, Kevin
Barry. Around a dozen or so people were working on Nova at Branch, and
aside from Barry, they’re all gone now. Once the news got out, Barry
took to Nova Launcher’s website and released a statement about the
layoffs, and the future of Nova. There has been confusion and
misinformation about the Nova team and what this means for Nova. I’d
like to clarify some things. The original Nova team, for many years, was
just me. Eventually I added Cliff to handle customer support, and when
Branch acquired Nova, Cliff continued with this role. I also had
contracted Rob for some dev work prior to the Branch acquisition and
some time after the acquisition closed we were able to bring him onboard
as a contractor at Branch. The three of us were the core Nova team.
However, I’ve always been the lead and primary contributor to Nova
Launcher and that hasn’t changed. I will continue to control the
direction and development of Nova Launcher. ↫ Kevin Barry This sounds
great, and I’m glad the original creator will keep control over Nova.
However, with such a massive culling of developers, it only makes sense
that any future plans will have to be scaled down, and that’s exactly
what both Barry and other former team members are saying. First, Rob
Wainwright, who was laid off, wrote the following in Nova’s Discord: To
be clear, Nova development is not stopping. Kevin is remaining at Branch
as Nova’s only full time developer. Development will undoubtedly slow
with less people working on the app but the current plan is for updates
to continue in some form. ↫ Rob Wainwright Barry followed up with an
affirmation: I am planning on wrapping up some Nova 8.1 work and getting
more builds out. I am going to need to cut scope compared to what was
planned. ↫ Kevin Barry In other words, while development on Nova will
continue, it’s now back to being a one-man project, which will have some
major implications for the pace of development. It makes me wonder if
the adoption of the yearly drop of new Android features will be reduced,
and if we’re going to see much more unresolved bugs and issues. On top
of that, one has to wonder just how long Branch is for this world –
they’ve just laid off about a hundred people, so what will happen to
Barry if Branch goes under? Will he have to find some other job, leaving
even less time for Nova development? And if Branch doesn’t go under, it
is still clearly in dire financial straits, which must make somehow
monetising Nova users in less pleasant ways come into the picture. The
future of Nova was definitely dealt a massive blow this week, and I’m
fearful for its future. Again.</p>

<p>Idea for a neat product from Automattic or really anyone: Configure
WordPress for writing a book, hook it up to an AI service that can
always turn that site into prose, reorganized into chapters, however
you’d like, on demand, in an instant. You could use an outliner to
arrange the table of contents and it could automatically generate a back
of the book index. Technologically I think today’s AI is ready to do
this, just needs to be packaged. Charge a fair price for the service,
esp at the beginning it would totally be worth it. Who knows where it
would lead. I bet a lot of writers would use it, I certainly would.</p>

carry two phones, an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_13_Pro">iPhone 13 Pro</a>
and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_6">Pixel 6 Pro</a>.
The latter is my main phone, and I prefer it to the Apple phone, not
sure why, it’s what I use for most things. I need the iPhone because I
use an Apple Watch. Lately there’s been some trouble with the screen on
the Pixel 6, on certain gestures, the right edge lights up in bright
green and then immediately returns to normal. I’m thinking the display
may be about to fail? It might be time for a new phone. So I went to the
Pixel site to see what they have that’s new and found that they’re
announcing a new phone, the
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/ac8f1461-9923-43da-87b9-b951ff2f32b2">Pixel
9</a>, on Tuesday. So I immediately, of course, dropped the idea of
buying an upgrade today, why not wait till the new version is out. I
looked over the teaser, guessing that AI figures big in this release.
Not sure how I feel about that because the last thing I want to do is
switch over to Google’s AI from my beloved ChatGPT. Kind of the same
thing I see happening with Threads re Twitter.</p>

id="reynolds-lively-husband-and-wife-team-wins-weekend-box-office">Reynolds-Lively
husband and wife team wins weekend box office</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — In the Ryan Reynolds-Blake Lively box-office showdown,
both husband and wife came out as winners. </p>
<p>Reynolds’ Marvel Studios smash “Deadpool &amp; Wolverine” remained
the top movie in North American theaters for the third straight week
with $54.2 million in ticket sales according to studio estimates Sunday.
Worldwide, it’s now surpassed $1 billion.</p>
<p>“Deadpool &amp; Wolverine,” though, was closely followed by “It Ends
With Us,” the romance drama starring Lively, which surpassed
expectations with a stellar $50 million debut. </p>
<p>Together, the films created a kind of family edition of
“Barbenheimer,” in which a pair of very different movies thrived in part
due to counterprogramming. Only this time, the opposite movies were
fronted by one of Hollywood’s most famous couples. The films’ one-two
punch wasn’t entirely unprecedented. In 1990, Bruce Willis’ “Die Hard 2”
led the box office while Demi Moore’s “Ghost” came in second. </p>
<p>The weekend also featured a high-priced flop. “Borderlands,” the
long-delayed $120-million videogame adaptation directed by Eli Roth,
launched with a paltry $8.8 million for Lionsgate. The film, starring
Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart and Jack Black, was shot all the way back in
2021. After delays and reshoots, it finally landed in theaters
effectively dead-on-arrival; it scored just 10% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes
and seems likely to contend for one of the worst movies of the
year. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, “Deadpool &amp; Wolverine,” which co-stars Hugh Jackman,
continued its march through box-office records. The film, directed by
Shawn Levy, is only the second R-rated movie to reach $1 billion,
following 2019’s “Joker.” In three weeks, it’s already one of the most
lucrative Marvel releases and trails only Disney’s other 2024 smash,
“Inside Out” ($1.6 billion worldwide) among movies released this
year. </p>
<p>Lively makes a cameo in “Deadpool &amp; Wolverine” but she both stars
in and produced “It Ends With Us.” Adapted from the bestselling romance
novel by Colleen Hoover, Lively stars as Lily Bloom, a Boston florist
torn between two men, one from her present life (Justin Baldoni, who
also directed the film) and another who was her first love (Brandon
Sklenar).<br />
</p>
<p>“It Ends With Us” cost a modest $25 million to produce, so it will
turn a significant profit for co-financers Columbia Pictures and
Wayfarer Studios. Like another female-skewing summer-release book
adaptation from Sony, “Where the Crawdads Sing,” “It Ends With Us” could
hold well through the typically slower August box-office period.
Audiences gave it an A- CinemaScore. </p>
<p>Reynolds and Lively occasionally played up the convergence of their
movies. Earlier this week, Reynolds posted a video of himself posing
junket questions to Sklenar. The timing paid off especially for Lively,
whose film doubled earlier opening-weekend forecasts. </p>
<p>Neon’s “Cuckoo,” a German Alps-set horror film by filmmaker Tilman
Singer, opened with $3 million on 1,503 screen. It stars Hunter Schafer
and Dan Stevens.</p>
<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian
theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released
Monday. </p>

week in US stocks leaves investors braced for bumps ahead</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — A week of wild market swings has investors looking ahead
to inflation data, corporate earnings and presidential polls for signals
that could soothe a recent outbreak of turbulence in U.S. stocks. </p>
<p>Following months of placid trading, U.S. stock volatility has surged
this month as a run of alarming data coincided with the unwinding of a
massive, yen-fueled carry trade to deal equities their worst selloff of
the year. The S&amp;P 500 .SPX is still down around 6% from a record
high set last month, even after making up ground in a series of rallies
after Monday’s crushing selloff.  </p>
<p>At issue for many investors is the trajectory of the U.S. economy.
After months of betting on an economic soft landing, investors rushed to
price in the risk of a more severe downturn, following
weaker-than-expected manufacturing and employment data last week.  </p>
<p>“Everybody is now worried about the economy,” said Bob Kalman, a
portfolio manager at Miramar Capital. “We are moving away from the greed
portion of the program and now the market is facing the fear of
significant geopolitical risks, a hotly contested election and
volatility that is not going away.”  </p>
<p>Though stocks have rallied in recent days, traders believe it will be
a while before calm returns to markets. Indeed, the historical behavior
of the Cboe Volatility Index .VIX - which saw its biggest one-day jump
ever on Monday - shows that surges of volatility usually take months to
dissipate.  </p>
<p>Known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, the index measures demand for
options protection from market swings. When it closes above 35 - an
elevated level that it topped on Monday - the index has taken 170
sessions on average to return to 17.6, its long-term median and a level
associated with far less extreme investor anxiety, a Reuters analysis
showed.  </p>
<p>One potential flashpoint will be when the U.S. reports consumer price
data on Wednesday. Signs that inflation is dropping too steeply could
bolster fears that the Federal Reserve has sent the economy into a
tailspin by leaving interest rates elevated for too long, contributing
to market turbulence.  </p>
<p>For now, futures markets are pricing in a 55% chance the central bank
will bring down benchmark interest rates by 50 basis points in
September, at its next policy meeting, compared with a roughly 5% chance
seen a month ago.  </p>
<p>“Slower payroll growth reinforces that U.S. economic risks are
becoming more two-sided as inflation cools and activity slows,” said
Oscar Munoz, chief U.S. macro strategist at TD Securities, in a recent
note.  </p>
<p>Corporate earnings, meanwhile, have been neither strong enough nor
weak enough to give the market direction, said Charles Lemonides, head
of hedge fund ValueWorks LLC.  </p>
<p>Overall, companies in the S&amp;P 500 have reported second-quarter
results that are 4.1% above expectations, in line with the long-term
average of 4.2% above expectations, according to LSEG data.  </p>
<p>Walmart WMT.N and Home Depot HD.N are among companies reporting
earnings next week, with their results seen as offering a snapshot on
how U.S. consumers are holding up after months of elevated interest
rates.  </p>
<p>The end of the month brings earnings from chip giant Nvidia NVDA.O,
whose shares are up around 110% this year even after a recent selloff.
The Fed’s annual Jackson Hole gathering, set for Aug. 22-24, will give
policymakers another chance to fine tune their monetary policy message
before their September meeting.  </p>
<p>Lemonides believes the recent volatility is a healthy correction
during an otherwise strong bull market, and he initiated a position in
Amazon.com AMZN.O to take advantage of its weakness.  </p>
<p>The U.S. presidential race is also likely to ramp up
uncertainty. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Democrat Kamala Harris leads Republican Donald Trump 42% to 37% in
the race for the Nov. 5 presidential election, according to an Ipsos
poll published on Thursday. Harris, the vice president, entered the race
on July 21 when President Joe Biden folded his campaign following a
disastrous debate performance on June 27 against Trump.  </p>
<p>With nearly three months until the Nov. 5 vote, investors are braced
for plenty of additional twists and turns in an election year that has
already been one of the most dramatic in recent memory.  </p>
<p>“While early events suggested a clearer picture of US Presidential
and Congressional outcomes, more recent events have again thrown the
outcome into doubt,” analysts at JPMorgan wrote.  </p>
<p>Chris Marangi, co-chief investment officer of value at Gabelli Funds,
believes the election will add to market volatility. At the same time,
expected rate cuts in September could boost a rotation into areas of the
market that have lagged in a year that has been dominated by Big Tech,
he said.  </p>
<p>“We expect increased volatility into the election but the underlying
rotation to continue as lower rates offset economic weakness,” he
said.</p>

Wilson, US women hold off France to win eighth straight Olympic
basketball gold medal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Paris — A’ja Wilson scored 21 points and the U.S. women’s basketball
team survived the biggest challenge of its unprecedented run to eight
straight Olympic gold medals with a 67-66 win over France at the Paris
Games on Sunday. </p>
<p>No team had been able to push the Americans during this impressive
streak of 61 consecutive wins. Only two of those victories had been by
single digits before the game against France. </p>
<p>The eight straight golds broke a tie with the American men’s program
that won seven in a row from 1936-68. The women’s victory came less than
24 hours after the U.S. men’s team also beat France in the title game.
This was the first time in Olympic history that both gold medal games
featured the same two teams. </p>
<p>Unlike the men’s game this one came down to the final minute and one
last shot by France that was just inside the 3-point line. </p>
<p>The Americans were up 67-64 with 3.9 seconds left after Kahleah
Copper hit two free throws. Marine Johannes brought the ball up the
court to Gabby Williams who caught the ball just inside the 3-point line
and banked in over the outstreched arms of Breanna Srewart for the final
margin. </p>
<p>There was a brief delay before the officials signaled that it was a
two-point shot, which led to the beginning of a celebration and a lot of
happy hugs for the Americans and left the French players standing in
disbelief as they fell just short. </p>
<p>Williams, who finished with 19 points, had hit a deep 3 a few seconds
earlier to get France within one before Copper’s free throws.</p>

<h2 id="fifty-shades-of-people-and-their-blogs">Fifty shades of people
and their blogs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-11, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;This past Friday the 50th interview of the People and Blogs series went live and we’re also about to close the first year for this series. As always, milestones are arbitrary but I thought it would be fun to take a moment to look back at the first 50 interviews.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
First thing first, a big, big thank you to all the wonderful guests who
took the time to answer my questions. I am technically the creator of
this series but what matters are the people—and their blogs. So thank
you 50x to all you wonderful folks, but also thank you to the people who
have answered my questions already but whose interviews aren’t live yet.
As I think I wrote before, I try to keep a buffer and so I always have a
few interviews that are ready to go.
</p>
<p>
I’m sure the numbers are not actually correct because I did this very
quickly but collectively, we wrote 91.141 words, 504.217 characters. The
most used word is, unsurprisingly, <strong>I</strong>. Aside from the
other usual suspects—a, the, to, etc—the most common word is, quite
fittingly, <strong>blog</strong>.
</p>
<p>
The average interview is 1822 words with
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-derek-sivers">Derek Sivers</a> and
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-matthew-graybosch">Matthew
Graybosch</a> at the two ends of the spectrum with 487 and 5666 words
respectively. In terms of distribution, 5 guests wrote less than 1000
words, 30 are between 1000 and 2000, 9 are in the 2000 to 3000 range, 4
in the 3000 to 4000, 1—Riccardo Mori—is in the 4000 to 5000 bracket and
as mentioned Matthew is so far the only guest over 5000 words. I don’t
have rules when it comes to length and it’s always interesting to see
how much people end up writing.
</p>
<p>
Also interesting how the overwhelming majority of guests spend a similar
amount of money to run their blogs. I didn’t double-check this but I
think almost everyone is in the 50$ to 150$ a year. I might do a deeper
dive at some point and plot costs and techs used by the people
interviewed. Maybe when we get to 100. That could be fun.
</p>
<p>
Since we’re talking numbers, how about the audience of the series?
Crunching numbers is a bit hard since the interviews are delivered via
newsletter, RSS, and can also be read on the blog and only the
newsletter has some actual numbers. If I had to guess, probably a few
thousand people are reading these interviews. But that’s just an
educated guess. We’ll never know for sure.
</p>
<p>
What we do know for sure is that 74 people are currently very kindly
supporting it on <a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">Ko-Fi</a> and
I have to give a shout-out to
<a href="https://www.thingelstad.com/">Jamie Thingelstad</a> who decided
to become a supporter even before the first interview went live. I
appreciate the trust Jamie. I’m also particularly happy with the fact
that a bunch of the supporters have been featured on the series. There
are a couple of things I have planned and their feasibility is strictly
tied to how many people support the series so if you do enjoy it, please
<a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">consider becoming a
supporter</a> for as little as 1$ a month.
</p>
<p>
50 interviews, 50 people, and 50 blogs. I renewed the other day the
domain name for another year so we’ll for sure get to 100 at least. Will
we ever get to 500? How about 1000? Can I run this series for the next
20 years? Will people blog in 20 years? If you’re a time traveler get in
touch because I’d love to know.
</p>

<h2
id="us-commits-to-freeing-americans-held-by-taliban-in-afghanistan">US
commits to freeing Americans held by Taliban in Afghanistan</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Islamabad — The United States has promised to make every effort to
secure the release of three Americans whom it says are being held
“unjustly” by Taliban authorities in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Ryan Corbett, Mahmood Habibi, and George Glezmann were taken captive
in separate incidents in Kabul in 2022, roughly a year after the Taliban
stormed back to power in the Afghan capital.</p>
<p>“My thoughts and prayers are with Ryan Corbett, Mahmood Habibi, and
their families today,” Thomas West, the U.S. special envoy for
Afghanistan, said on X, formerly Twitter, marking the two-year
anniversary of the capture of the two men.</p>
<p>“We will and we must continue every effort to bring them and George
Glezmann home to their families,” he wrote Sunday. </p>
<p>Roger Carstens, the U.S. special presidential envoy for hostage
affairs, in separate remarks posted on X, said that the three “have been
held for far too long and their families have endured unimaginable
pain.”</p>
<p>Corbett is a humanitarian worker who had lived with his family in
Afghanistan for years. He was evacuated during the August 2021 Taliban
takeover following the withdrawal of U.S.-led Western troops.</p>
<p>Corbett returned to Afghanistan in 2022 and was detained by the
Taliban but has not been charged with any crimes, according to his
family.</p>
<p>Glezmann was visiting Kabul as a tourist lawfully traveling in
Afghanistan when he was seized by the Taliban’s intelligence services on
December 5, 2022, “without just cause or formal charge,” according to
the Foley Foundation, working to secure freedom for Americans held
unjustly captive abroad.</p>
<p>Separately on Saturday, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, or
FBI, released a statement seeking information into the disappearance of
Habibi, saying he was taken from his vehicle near his home in the Afghan
capital, along with his driver, on August 10, 2022.</p>
<p>The FBI stated that the Afghan-American businessman worked as a
contractor for Asia Consultancy Group, a Kabul-based telecommunications
company. “It is believed that Mr. Habibi was taken by Taliban military
or security forces and has not been heard from since his disappearance,”
the agency noted. </p>
<p>Habibi was detained by the Taliban reportedly on suspicion that his
company was involved in a July 31 U.S. drone strike in Kabul that killed
Ayman al-Zawahiri, the fugitive al-Qaida network chief. The FBI said
that de facto Afghan authorities had also briefly detained 29 other
employees of the Asia Consultancy Group.</p>
<p>The Taliban have officially not responded to the latest U.S. calls
for releasing the three Americans.</p>
<p>While de facto Afghan authorities have publicly disclosed that
Corbett and Glezmann are among “several foreign nationals” imprisoned in
Afghanistan for allegedly violating local immigration and other laws,
they refuse to acknowledge holding Habibi.</p>
<p>On Sunday, an Afghan television station quoted Zabihullah Mujahid,
the Taliban’s chief spokesperson, claiming that they have imprisoned
only two American citizens and are not holding Habibi.</p>
<p>He reiterated that Kabul would release the prisoners in exchange for
Afghans in U.S. custody, the Ariana News network reported on its
website.</p>
<p>“We don’t have anyone named Habibi in our prisons. But the
investigation is ongoing to find out what happened in this regard,”
Mujahid stated.</p>
<p>The Taliban announced last month for the first time that they had
discussed a possible prisoner exchange in direct talks with U.S.
officials on the sidelines of an international conference in Doha,
Qatar, hosted by the United Nations. </p>
<p>“During our meetings, we talked about the two American citizens who
are in prison in Afghanistan,” Mujahid told reporters after the
meeting.</p>
<p>“But they must accept Afghanistan’s conditions. We also have
prisoners in America, prisoners in Guantanamo. We should free our
prisoners in exchange for them,” he said without elaborating.</p>
<p>Last week, the U.S. State Department spokesperson told reporters in
Washington that U.S. officials have raised the detainees’ fate in every
meeting with the Taliban.</p>
<p>Matthew Miller stated that Corbett and Glezmann “are wrongfully
detained,” according to the U.S. legal determination. “That’s not a
determination we have yet made with respect to Mahmood Habibi, which is
not to say we’re not working to try and secure his release,” he
explained.</p>
<p>“Oftentimes, we can’t make a wrongful detention determination because
we don’t have access to certain types of information or because the
situation is unclear. There can be other factors as well,” Miller
explained.</p>

<p>I regularly report on the progress made by the Servo project, the
Rust-based browser engine that was spun out of Mozilla into its own
project. Servo has its own reference browser implementation, too, but
did you know there’s already other browsers using Servo, too? Sure, it’s
clearly a work-in-progress thing, and it’s missing just about every
feature we’ve come to expect from a browser, but it’s cool nonetheless.
Verso is a web browser built on top of Servo web engine. It’s still
under development. We dont’ accept any feature request at the moment.
But if you are interested, feel free to help test it. ↫ Verso GitHub

ext-image-copy-capture-v1 screen copy protocols build upon wlroots’
wlr-screencopy-unstable-v1 with various improvements for better screen
capture support under Wayland. These new protocols should allow for
better performance and window capturing support for use-cases around
RDP/VNC remote desktop, screen sharing, and more. ↫ Michael Larabel A
very big addition to Wayland, as this has been a sore spot for many

says it will appeal decision forcing US gymnast Jordan Chiles to return
her bronze medal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Paris — U.S. Olympic officials say they will appeal a court ruling
that resulted in American gymnast Jordan Chiles being asked to return
the bronze medal she won in the Paris Olympics floor exercise. </p>
<p>The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) voided an on-floor appeal by
Chiles’ coach that vaulted her to third, saying the appeal came 4
seconds beyond the 1-minute time limit for scoring inquiries. </p>
<p>The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) said Saturday night it
would respect the court’s decision and elevate Barbosu to third. The
International Olympic Committee confirmed the ruling Sunday, announcing
that it was reallocating the bronze from last Monday’s women’s floor
final to Romanian Ana Barbosu. </p>
<p>“We firmly believe that Jordan rightfully earned the bronze medal,
and there were critical errors in both the initial scoring by the
International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) and the subsequent CAS appeal
process that need to be addressed,” the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic
Committee statement said. </p>
<p>CAS ruled Saturday that Team USA coach Cecile Landi’s appeal to have
0.1 added to Chiles’ score came outside the 1-minute window allowed by
the FIG. The ad hoc committee wrote that Landi’s inquiry came 1 minute,
4 seconds after Chiles’ initial score was posted. </p>
<p>The IOC said in a statement it will be in touch with the USOPC
regarding the return of Chiles’ bronze and will work with the Romanian
Olympic Committee to discuss a reallocation ceremony honoring
Barbosu. </p>
<p>“The initial error occurred in the scoring by FIG, and the second
error was during the CAS appeal process, where the USOPC was not given
adequate time or notice to effectively challenge the decision,” said the
USOPC statement, which was released Sunday. </p>
<p>It was unclear the exact process the appeal would take first. The two
potential places the USOPC could take the appeal would be to
Switzerland’s highest court, the Swiss Tribunal or the European Court of
Human Rights. </p>
<p>CAS wrote Saturday that the initial finishing order should be
restored, with Barbosu third, Romanian Sabrina Maneca-Voinea fourth and
Chiles fifth. The organization added the FIG should determine the final
ranking “in accordance with the above decision,” but left it up to the
federation to decide who would get the medal behind gold winner Rebeca
Andrade of Brazil and silver medalist Simone Biles of the U.S. </p>
<p>The FIG said it was the IOC’s call on whether to reallocate the
medal. The IOC confirmed Sunday it would respect FIG’s decision and seek
to have Chiles’ medal returned. </p>
<p>The rapid turn of events adds another layer to what has been a
difficult few days for all three athletes. </p>
<p>Romanian gymnastics legend and 1976 Olympic champion Nadia Comaneci
feared for Barbosu’s mental health because of the wrenching sequence in
which she went from bronze medalist to fourth-place finisher. </p>
<p>“I can’t believe we play with athletes mental health and emotions
like this… let’s protect them,” Comaneci posted on X earlier in the
week. </p>
<p>Comaneci, at the same time, criticized the judges for the way they
scored Maneca-Voinea’s routine — the gymnast was docked 0.1 points for
stepping out of bounds, but viral replays showed she narrowly stayed
inbounds. Comaneci urged the Romanian Olympic Committee to protest,
which it did, but CAS denied that appeal. </p>
<p>Chiles hinted at the decision in an Instagram story on Saturday,
indicating she is heartbroken and is “taking this time and removing
myself from social media for my mental health, thank you.” </p>
<p>Jazmin Chiles, Jordan’s sister, said on Instagram that Chiles was
stripped of a medal “not because she wasn’t good enough. But because the
judges failed to give her difficulty and forced an inquiry to be
made.” </p>
<p>U.S. teammates offered support to Chiles, a two-time Olympian. </p>
<p>“Sending you so much love Jordan,” American star Simone Biles posted
on Instagram. “Keep your chin up ‘Olympic champ’ we love you.” </p>
<p>“All this talk about the athlete, what about the judges?” six-time
Olympic medalist Sunisa Lee added on Instagram. “Completely
unacceptable, this is awful and I’m gutted for jordan.” </p>
<p>USA Gymnastics said in a statement on Saturday it is “devastated” by
the ruling. </p>
<p>“The inquiry into the Difficulty Value of Jordan Chiles’ floor
exercise routine was filed in good faith and, we believed, in accordance
with FIG rules to ensure accurate scoring,” the organization wrote. </p>
<p>Barbosu and Maneca-Voinea were left outside the medals in the floor
final after finishing with matching scores of 13.700. Barbosu thought
she had won bronze over Maneca-Voinea via a tiebreaker — a higher
execution score — and began celebrating with a Romanian flag. </p>
<p>Chiles was the last athlete to compete and initially given a score of
13.666 that placed her fifth, right behind Maneca-Voinea. Landi called
for an inquiry on Chiles’ score was announced. </p>
<p>“At this point, we had nothing to lose, so I was like ‘We’re just
going to try,’” Landi said after the awards ceremony. “I honestly didn’t
think it was going to happen, but when I heard her scream, I turned
around and was like ‘What?’” </p>
<p>Judges awarded the appeal, leapfrogging Chiles past Barbosu and
Maneca-Voinea. </p>
<p>Barbosu made it a point after returning home to Romania that she had
no problem with Chiles. </p>
<p>“I only want for everybody to be fair, we don’t want to start picking
on other athletes of any nationality,” Barbosu told reporters. “We as
athletes don’t deserve something like that, we only want to perform as
best as we can and to be rewarded based on our performance. The problems
lie with the judges, with their calculations and decisions.” </p>
<p>Chiles’ mother, Gina Chiles, called out the critics in a post,
writing she was “tired” of the derogatory comments being leveled at
Jordan. </p>
<p>“My daughter is a highly decorated Olympian with the biggest heart
and a level of sportsmanship that is unmatched,” Gina Chiles posted.
“And she’s being called disgusting things.” </p>
<p>The uncertainty also tinges what had been a beautiful moment on the
medal stand, when Chiles and Biles knelt to honor Andrade after the
Brazilian star won her fourth medal in Paris. </p>
<p>“It was just the right thing to do,” Biles said about a moment that
soon went viral, with even the Louvre itself suggesting it might be
worthy enough for a spot somewhere in the vicinity of the Mona
Lisa. </p>
<p>That memory now carries a complicated and emotional postscript.</p>

honor ‘Peanuts’ creator with corn mazes in US, Canada</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Visitors to corn mazes across the country are finding a
familiar and joyous figure in the winding labyrinth of tall stalks.
Snoopy.</p>
<p>More than 80 farms in the U.S. and Canada have teamed up with Peanuts
Worldwide to create “Peanuts”-themed mazes to celebrate the beloved
strip’s 75th birthday this summer and fall.</p>
<p>A massive Snoopy rests on top of his doghouse in a maze at Dull’s
Tree Farm in Thorntown, Indiana, and he’s depicted gleefully atop a
pumpkin at Downey’s Farm in Caledon, Ontario.</p>
<p>“All of these events helps keep my dad’s legacy alive,” says Jill
Schulz, an actor and daughter of “Peanuts” creator Charles M.
Schulz.</p>
<p>“As someone who can’t even keep houseplants alive, the fact that they
can do that with a corn maze and get the artwork right and create a fun
experience for all ages is pretty incredible,” she adds, laughing.</p>
<p>The mazes — which span 35 states and provinces, from California to
New York, Ontario to Texas — are expected to attract more than 2 million
visitors. Farmers are signing up for the free service because the mazes
are part of the customer lure, in addition to things like hay rides,
fresh produce and pumpkin carvings.</p>
<p>Each maze is designed for the size of the farm — from 1.5 acres to 20
acres — and are mostly corn but also sunflowers. They’re custom created
by the world’s largest corn maze consulting company, The MAiZE Inc.</p>
<p>The Utah-based Brett Herbst, who leads the company and who launched
his first corn maze in 1996, says technology has only somewhat changed
the way corn mazes are made.</p>
<p>“The first year we did it, we just used a weed whacker with a saw
blade on it when the corn was fully grown,” he says. “Now we do it when
it’s short and we go in and either mow it or rototill it. We design it
all on a computer, but most of it we actually just go draw it out on the
ground by hand.”</p>
<p>He and his team have over the years designed mazes with everything
from the faces of presidential candidates, Oprah Winfrey, zombies, John
Wayne and Chris LeDoux. Charlie Brown and Co. just work well, he
says.</p>
<p>“It’s very nostalgic and just seemed like a very natural fit from the
get-go to embrace that with ‘Peanuts,’” he says. “It’s harvest time.
It’s kind of become this iconic thing.”</p>
<p>There’s an art and a science to maze building, a balance between
maintaining the integrity of the image, but also making it a true maze
where people can actually get lost in. “That’s definitely a challenge
there,” says Herbst. “You want to accomplish both as much as
possible.”</p>
<p>“Peanuts” made its debut Oct. 2, 1950. The travails of the “little
round-headed kid” Charlie Brown and his pals eventually ran in more than
2,600 newspapers, reaching millions of readers in 75 countries.</p>
<p>The strip offers enduring images of kites in trees, Charlie Brown
trying to kick a football, tart-tongued Lucy handing out advice for a
nickel and Snoopy taking the occasional flight of fancy to the skies.
Phrases such as “security blanket” and “good grief” are a part of the
global vernacular. Schulz died in 2000.</p>
<p>There’s something timeless about corn mazes, and that’s what excites
Jill Schulz so much. They offer kids a chance to disconnect from their
online life and celebrate something their parents did.</p>
<p>“It’s great to have an opportunity to just bring kids to events that
are old school, because it’s also important for parents and grandparents
to introduce something they loved to do as a child,” she says.</p>
<p>“I think we all need a little innocence for our children right now
with all the technology out there. We need a little ‘put down your phone
and go out and have some good old fashioned, old school family time.’ I
think that’s important.”</p>

id="heres-what-to-know-about-nasa-astronauts-delayed-return-to-earth">Here’s
what to know about NASA astronauts’ delayed return to Earth</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — NASA is wrestling over how and when to
bring two astronauts back from the International Space Station, after
repeatedly delaying their return aboard Boeing’s troubled capsule.</p>
<p>Do they take a chance and send them home soon in Boeing’s Starliner?
Or wait and bring them back next year with SpaceX?</p>
<p>Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have been up there since early June,
their planned eight-day mission at the two-month mark and possibly
surpassing eight months.</p>
<p>Testing continues, with Boeing expressing confidence in its
spacecraft but NASA divided. A decision is expected next week.</p>
<p>What’s wrong with Boeing’s Starliner?</p>
<p>This is Boeing’s first time launching astronauts, after flying a pair
of empty Starliners that suffered software and other issues. Even before
Wilmore and Williams blasted off June 5, their capsule sprang a leak in
propulsion-related plumbing. Boeing and NASA judged the small helium
leak to be stable and isolated, and proceeded with the test flight. But
as Starliner approached the space station the next day, four more leaks
erupted. Five thrusters also failed.</p>
<p>The capsule managed to dock safely, and four of the thrusters
ultimately worked. But engineers scrambled, conducting thruster
test-firings on the ground and in space. After two months, there’s still
no root cause for the thruster malfunctions. All but one of the 28
thrusters seem OK, but the fear is that if too many conk out again, the
crew’s safety could be jeopardized. The thrusters are needed at flight’s
end to keep the capsule in the right position for the critical deorbit
burn.</p>
<p>Are the two astronauts stranded?</p>
<p>NASA bristles at suggestions that Wilmore and Williams are stranded
or stuck. NASA has stressed from the get-go that in an emergency at the
space station — like a fire or decompression — Starliner could still be
used by the pair as a lifeboat to leave. A former NASA executive said
Thursday the astronauts are “kind of stuck,” although certainly not
stranded. They’re safe aboard the space station with plenty of supplies
and work to do, said Scott Hubbard.</p>
<p>If NASA decides to go with a SpaceX return, Starliner would be be cut
loose first to open up one of two parking spots for U.S. capsules.
Before that happens Wilmore and Williams would fashion seats for
themselves in the SpaceX Dragon capsule currently docked at the space
station. That’s because every station occupant needs a lifeboat at all
times. Once Starliner’s docking port is empty, then SpaceX could launch
another Dragon to fill that slot — the one that Wilmore and Williams
would ride.</p>
<p>Why might they have to wait until next year?</p>
<p>Like Boeing’s Starliner, SpaceX’s Dragon is meant to carry four
astronauts. To make room for Wilmore and Williams, NASA said Wednesday
it could bump two of the four astronauts due to launch to the space
station next month with SpaceX. The empty seats would be reserved for
Wilmore and Williams, but they would have to remain up there until
February. That’s because station missions are supposed to last at least
six months. Some have lasted a year. Two Russians up there right now
will close out a yearlong stint when they return in a three-seat Soyuz
capsule in September alongside a NASA crewmate. There’s no thought given
to ordering up a special SpaceX express, and the Dragon at the station
now is the ride home next month for four residents.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time a U.S. astronaut has had their stay
extended. NASA astronaut Frank Rubio and his two Russian crewmates ended
up spending just over a year in space after their docked Soyuz capsule
was hit by space junk and leaked all its coolant. An empty Russian
capsule was sent up to bring them back last September.</p>
<p>What do the astronauts think about all this?</p>
<p>Wilmore and Williams are both retired Navy captains and longtime NASA
astronauts who already have long space station missions behind them.
Wilmore, 61, and Williams, 58, said going into this test flight that
they expected to learn a lot about Starliner and how it operates. At
their only news conference from space in July, they assured reporters
they were keeping busy, helping with repairs and research, and expressed
confidence in all the Starliner testing going on behind the scenes.
There’s been no public word from them yet on the prospects of an
eight-month stay.</p>
<p>Is there enough food, water and air?</p>
<p>Wilmore and Williams’ suitcases were removed from Starliner before
liftoff to make room for equipment urgently needed for the space
station’s urine-into-drinking-water recycling system. So they made do
with spare clothes already up there. A supply ship finally arrived this
week with their clothes, along with extra food and science experiments
for the entire nine-person crew. More supplies are due in a few more
months. As for air, the space station has its own oxygen-generating
systems. Despite the fat reserves, NASA would like to get back to normal
as soon as possible. Besides Wilmore and Williams, there are four other
Americans and three Russians on board.</p>
<p>Why is NASA sticking with Starliner?</p>
<p>NASA deliberately hired two companies to get its crews to and from
the space station, just as it did for delivering cargo. The space agency
considered it an insurance policy of sorts: If one crew or cargo
provider was grounded, the other could carry the load. ’You want to have
another alternative both for cost reasons and for safety reasons and
options. So NASA needs Boeing to be successful,” said Hubbard, who
served on the Columbia Accident Investigation Board in 2003.</p>
<p>Even with the latest setbacks, NASA insists it wants to keep using
Boeing Starliners for astronaut rides. The goal is to send up one Dragon
and one Starliner every year with crews, six months apart, until the
station is retired in 2030. SpaceX has been at it since 2020.</p>
<p>What does Boeing say?</p>
<p>Boeing insists its capsule could still safely bring the astronauts
home. But the company said Wednesday it would take the steps necessary
to bring the capsule back empty if that’s NASA’s decision. Last week,
the company posted a list of all the tests that have been done on the
thrusters since liftoff.</p>
<p>“We still believe in Starliner’s capability and its flight
rationale.” the company said.</p>
<p>A longtime space contractor, Boeing has had to overcome multiple
Starliner problems over the years. The company had to launch an empty
Starliner twice before committing to a crew, repeating the initial
flight test because of bad software and other issues. The delays have
cost the company more than $1 billion.</p>
<p>Hubbard questions whether NASA and Boeing should have launched the
crew with the original helium leak, which cascaded into more.</p>
<p>“Whatever happens with the Starliner, they need to find out what the
problem was and fix it,” he said, “And give everybody confidence they
are still in the aerospace business in a major way.”</p>

id="ap-norc-poll-finds-extreme-heat-is-impacting-most-americans-electricity-bills">AP-NORC
poll finds extreme heat is impacting most Americans’ electricity
bills</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — During the summer, Levena Lindahl closes off entire
rooms, covers windows with blackout curtains and budgets to manage the
monthly cost of electricity for air conditioning. But even then, the
heat finds its way in.</p>
<p>“Going upstairs, it’s like walking into soup. It is so hot,” Lindahl
said. “If I walk past my attic upstairs, you can feel the heat radiating
through a closed door.”</p>
<p>Lindahl, 37, who lives in North Carolina, said her monthly
electricity bills in the summer used to be around $100 years ago, but
they’ve since doubled. She blames a gradual warming trend caused by
climate change.</p>
<p>Around 7 in 10 Americans say in the last year extreme heat has had an
impact on their electricity bills, ranging from minor to major, and most
have seen at least a minor impact on their outdoor activities, according
new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs
Research.</p>
<p>As tens of millions of Americans swelter through another summer of
historic heat waves, the survey’s findings reveal how extreme heat is
changing people’s lives in big and small ways. The poll found that about
7 in 10 Americans have been personally affected by extremely hot weather
or extreme heat waves over the past five years. That makes extreme heat
a more common experience than other weather events or natural disasters
like wildfires, major droughts and hurricanes, which up to one-third of
U.S. adults said they’ve been personally affected by.</p>
<p>Sizable shares of Americans – around 4 in 10 – report that extreme
heat has had at least a minor impact on their sleep, pets or exercise
routine.</p>
<p>Jim Graham, 54, lives in Phoenix, Arizona, and worries about the
safety of his dog’s paws when going on walks outside, especially when it
gets above 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius). To protect her
feet, they head out for walks at 5:30 a.m. “This year it seems hotter
than usual,” said Graham. His single-level home has central air
conditioning and even setting the thermostat to 80 degrees Fahrenheit
(27 degrees Celsius) runs him over $350 a month in electricity bills, a
big jump from what he used to pay about a decade ago.</p>
<p>He’s not the only one watching the dollars add up: About 4 in 10
Americans say they’ve had unexpectedly expensive utility bills in the
past year because of storms, flood, heat, or wildfires, including nearly
half of homeowners.</p>
<p>Like Lindahl, many see a link to climate change. About 7 in 10 U.S.
adults who have experienced some type of severe weather events or
weather disasters in the last five years say they believe climate change
was a contributing factor. Three in 10 think climate change was not a
cause.</p>
<p>Last year Earth was 2.66 degrees Fahrenheit (1.48 degrees Celsius)
warmer than it was before pre-industrial times, according to the
European climate agency Copernicus. Some might perceive that increase as
insignificant, but temperatures are unevenly fluctuating across the
planet and can be dangerous to human health. Several regions of the U.S.
set all-time temperature records this summer, and Las Vegas reached a
scorching 120 degrees Fahrenheit (48.9 degrees Celsius) on July 7.</p>
<p>According to the poll, about 1 in 10 Americans say that extreme heat
has had a major impact on their sleep in the past year, while about 3 in
10 say it’s had a minor impact and 55% say it’s had no impact. Hispanic
Americans are more likely than white Americans to say their sleep has
been affected, and lower-income Americans are also more likely than
higher-income Americans to report an effect on their sleep.</p>
<p>The effects of extreme heat are more widely reported in the West and
South. About half of people living in the West say their sleep has been
impacted at least in a minor way by extreme heat, while about 4 in 10
people living in the South say their sleep has been impacted, compared
to about 3 in 10 people living in the Midwest and Northeast. People
living in the West and South are also more likely than those in the
Northeast to say their exercise routines have been affected.</p>
<p>Other aspects of daily life – like jobs and commutes, the timing of
events like weddings and reunions, and travel and vacation plans – have
been less broadly disrupted, but their impact is disproportionately felt
among specific groups of Americans. About one-quarter of Americans say
that their travel or vacation plans have been impacted by extreme heat,
with Hispanic and Black Americans more likely than white Americans to
say this.</p>
<p>Even simply enjoying time outside has become more difficult for some.
The poll found that about 6 in 10 Americans say extreme heat has
impacted outdoor activities for themselves or their family.</p>
<p>In general, people who don’t believe climate change is happening are
less likely to report being affected by various aspects of extreme heat
compared to people who do. For instance, about 8 in 10 Americans who
believe that climate change is happening say extreme heat has had at
least a minor impact on their electricity bills, compared to half of
Americans who aren’t sure climate change is happening or don’t think
it’s happening.</p>
<p>Mario Cianchetti, 70, is a retired engineer who now lives in Sedona,
Arizona. His home has solar panels and heat pumps, which he installed
because he was interested in lowering his electricity bills to save
money. “When you retire, you’re on a single fixed income. I didn’t want
to have to deal with rising energy costs,” said Cianchetti, who
identified himself as a political independent.</p>
<p>Cianchetti noted that temperatures feel unusually warm but said
installing sustainable technologies in his house was a matter of
finance. “It’s not that I don’t believe in climate change, yeah I
believe we’re going into a hot cycle here, but I don’t believe that it’s
man-caused.”</p>
<p>When it comes to general views of climate change, 70% of U.S. adults
say climate change is happening. About 6 in 10 of those who believe
climate change is happening say that it’s caused entirely or mostly by
human activities, while another 3 in 10 say it’s caused equally by human
activities and natural changes to the environment and 12% believe it’s
primarily caused by natural environmental change. Nine in 10 Democrats,
7 in 10 independents and about half of Republicans say climate change is
happening.</p>
<p>Those numbers are essentially unchanged from when the question was
last asked in April and have been steady in recent years, although about
half of Americans say they have become more concerned about climate
change over the past year.</p>
<p>(The poll of 1,143 adults was conducted July 25-29, 2024, using a
sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is
designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of
sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.1 percentage
points.)</p>

hunters will wrangle invasive pythons during Florida’s 10-day
challenge</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WEST PALM BEACH, Florida — Friday marked the start of the annual
Florida Python Challenge, where hunters head into the Everglades to
track down invasive Burmese pythons in hopes of grabbing a share of
$30,000 in prizes.</p>
<p>The annual 10-day hunt, which started more than a decade ago,
promotes public awareness of issues with invasive species in Florida
while engaging the public in Everglades conversation, said Sarah Funck,
the wildlife impact management section leader with Florida Fish and
Wildlife Conservation Commission.</p>
<p>“They are a well-established invasive species across much of South
Florida, unfortunately, in our natural areas,” Funck said of Burmese
pythons. “A huge part of this challenge is to make sure that people
understand about this issue and understand that in general, when you
have a non-native species present in the state for whatever purpose,
don’t let it loose, that can be really detrimental to our
environment.”</p>
<p>Over the past decade, the python challenge has grabbed headlines for
its incentive-based, only-in-Florida style of hunting as well as
celebrity participation. This year, more than 600 people registered for
the event, with two coming from Canada and 108 from other states.</p>
<p>During the challenge, hunters will linger around designated areas
spanning through western Broward County to the Tamiami Trail in the Big
Cypress Wildlife Management Area, including other management areas like
Southern Glades, Holey Land and Rotenberger.</p>
<p>The goal for the competition is to bring an incentive for hunters to
remove Burmese pythons from the environment, especially in the late
summer when python eggs hatch. The competition is also meant to educate
the public about pythons and their danger to Florida’s ecosystem,
because they affect native snakes, can spread diseases among native
animals and have high mercury levels that could be dangerous for native
animals and for human consumption, said Zachary Chejanovski, an
interagency python management coordinator with the Florida Wildlife
Commission.</p>
<p>“The python problem, it’s a big problem,” Chejanovski said. “We want
to make sure to get the word out as much as possible, because we can’t
do this alone.”</p>
<p>Each category has its own prizes, with $2,500 going to the person or
team that kills the most pythons, $1,500 going to the runner-up for most
kills and $1,000 going to whoever kills the longest python. The grand
prize for the most kills in all categories gets a $10,000 prize.</p>
<p>Each person can only win one prize, so if someone is tops in two
categories, they will end up with the highest-valued prize and the next
qualifying hunter gets the remaining prize.</p>
<p>During the competition, participants must turn in humanely killed
Burmese pythons to any of the competition’s three check stations in
South Florida. Hunters can also choose if they want to get the snake
carcass back after the contest’s judging if they’d like to use the skin
to make wallets, belts or bags.</p>
<p>Michael Huckabee and Jay Kattalikis attended the safety training
Friday morning, after driving in from Mississippi to participate in the
Florida Python Challenge. Kattalikis said this is his first time doing
the state’s python challenge, but that he’s not worried since he and
Huckabee are used to “wrangling gators” and handling copperheads and
rattlesnakes.</p>
<p>Kattalikis said he and Huckabee came here on a whim after another
friend told him about it, and he gave Huckabee only 15 minutes to get
ready before driving down to South Florida.</p>
<p>“All I could think was, ‘Holy crap, this is what I’ve lived doing my
entire life, and there’s a tournament doing it. I want to do this,’”
Kattalikis said.</p>
<p>In 2017, the South Florida Water Management District and the state
began hiring contractors to handle its invasive python problem year
round. According to the wildlife agency’s website, through 2023, more
than 11,000 pythons have been removed by these contractors.</p>
<p>Last year’s challenge brought in 209 pythons and the grand prize
winner was Paul Hobbs, who bagged 20 pythons. Also during 2023, Florida
wildlife agency and district contractors removed about 2,200
pythons.</p>
<p>Amy Siewe, the self-named Python Huntress, won a prize last year for
catching a Burmese python measuring 3.27 meters. This year, she won’t be
participating in the challenge due to a knee surgery but said she’s not
a fan of the annual challenge.</p>
<p>Siewe, who used to work as a state contractor catching invasive
pythons, said she believed the initial intent of the challenge was to
bring awareness to the issue. Now, it’s drawing large crowds of hunters,
potentially scaring off pythons and potentially killing native snakes
they mistake as pythons, like corn snakes, brown water snakes or
cottonmouths.</p>
<p>“Pythons don’t take on their normal behavioral pattern because
there’s so much traffic and they’ll come up and then they’ll go back
into the swamp,” Siewe said. “I feel for myself, it’s
counterproductive.”</p>
<p>Participants are required to undergo an online training, including
information on how to identify Burmese pythons versus other snakes,
Funck said. She said there’s also an additional optional in-person
training participants can attend to properly identify Burmese
pythons.</p>
<p>“That’s a huge part of what we do, is try to get the word out on how
to identify these pythons, how to safely and humanely capture it,” Funck
said.</p>

id="sinaloa-cartel-cofounder-claims-he-was-forced-to-come-to-us">Sinaloa
cartel cofounder claims he was forced to come to US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, cofounder of the Sinaloa drug
cartel, claims he was kidnapped and is sitting in a U.S. federal prison
cell in Texas because he trusted Joaquin Guzman Lopez, one of the “Los
Chapitos,” the sons of Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, his cartel
cofounder.</p>
<p>Zambada made the claim in a Saturday statement from U.S. federal
detention sent to VOA and other news organizations by his lawyer, Frank
Perez.</p>
<p>Zambada has pleaded not guilty to seven federal charges in the U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Texas. Most of the charges
involve drug trafficking, use of firearms and homicide. Guzman Lopez,
who surrendered to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the FBI
on July 25, has pleaded not guilty in the U.S.  District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois in Chicago on narcotics, money-laundering
and firearms charges.</p>
<p>“The Justice Department has taken into custody two additional alleged
leaders of the Sinaloa cartel, one of the most violent and powerful drug
trafficking organizations in the world,” Attorney General Merrick B.
Garland said in a statement on July 25, the night they landed in a
private airplane at Santa Teresa, New Mexico, in the border area near El
Paso, Texas.</p>
<p>“I did not turn myself in, and I did not come voluntarily to the
United States. Nor did I have any agreement with either government. To
the contrary, I was kidnapped and brought to the U.S. forcibly and
against my will,” Zambada wrote in the statement. Zambada is waiting to
be moved to New York, where the Justice Department transferred the
case.</p>
<p>Why Guzmán López would come to the U.S., reportedly voluntarily, and
forcibly bring Zambada to with him is not known. Both men face years in
prison in the United States.</p>
<p>DEA sources have said Guzman Lopez had been coordinating his
surrender for some time.</p>
<p>“I was ambushed,” Zambada wrote in his statement, recounting a
meeting at the Huertos del Pedregal ranch on the outskirts of Culiacán,
the Sinaloa state capital, to resolve differences between political
leaders to which he said he had been invited. The political leaders were
Sinaloa Governor Rubén Rocha Moya, who has denied being at the ranch and
has distanced himself from knowing Zambada, and Héctor Melesio Cuen
Ojeda, a former federal deputy, mayor of Culiacán and rector of the
Autonomous University of Sinaloa.</p>
<p>“A group of men assaulted me, knocked me to the ground, and placed a
dark-colored hood over my head. They tied me up and handcuffed me, then
forced me into the bed of a pickup truck.”</p>
<p>Cuen Ojeda was killed that night allegedly in a robbery attempt,
something Zambada disputes.  “They killed him at the same time and in
the same place where they kidnapped me,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Zambada, until now untouchable, accuses Guzman Lopez of physical
abuse. He said in his statement that Guzman Lopez hurt his back, knee
and wrists as he forced him onto the private airplane.</p>
<p>Guzman Lopez “removed the hood from my head and bound me with zip
ties to the seat,” Zambada said, adding, “No one else was aboard the
plane except Joaquin, the pilot, and myself.”</p>
<p>The United States has stated that no resources from its government
were used in this operation, according to U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Ken
Salazar.</p>
<p>“This was an operation between the cartels where one handed over the
other,” he said at an August 9 press conference at the U.S. Embassy in
Mexico, without giving details.</p>
<p>The Justice Department has made clear both men will face justice as
the Sinaloa cartel is being singled out as the largest distributor of
synthetic drugs in the U.S.</p>
<p>“Fentanyl is the deadliest drug threat our country has ever faced,
and the Justice Department will not rest until every single cartel
leader, member, and associate responsible for poisoning our communities
is held accountable” Garland said in his statement the night of the
arrests.</p>
<p>Zambada has asked the governments of Mexico and the United States for
transparency about the events.</p>

officials release audio and video recordings from 2022 Texas school
shooting</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DALLAS — As law enforcement officers hung back outside Khloie Torres’
fourth-grade classroom in Uvalde, Texas, she begged for help in a series
of 911 calls, whispering into the phone that there were “a lot” of
bodies and telling the operator: “Please, I don’t want to die. My
teacher is dead. Oh, my God.”</p>
<p>At one point, the dispatcher asks Khloie if there are many people in
the room with her.</p>
<p>“No, it’s just me and a couple of friends. A lot of people are,” she
says, pausing briefly, “gone.”</p>
<p>Calls from Khloie and others, along with body camera footage and
surveillance videos from the May 24, 2022, shooting at Robb Elementary
School, were included in a massive collection of audio and video
recordings released by Uvalde city officials on Saturday after a
prolonged legal fight.</p>
<p>The Associated Press and other news organizations brought a lawsuit
after the officials initially refused to publicly release the
information. The massacre, which left 19 students and two teachers dead,
was one of the worst school shootings in U.S. history.</p>
<p>The delayed law enforcement response to the shooting has been widely
condemned as a massive failure: Nearly 400 officers waited more than 70
minutes before confronting the gunman in a classroom filled with dead
and wounded children and teachers. Families of the victims have long
sought accountability for the slow police response in the South Texas
city of about 15,000 people 130 kilometers west of San Antonio.</p>
<p>Brett Cross’ 10-year-old nephew, Uziyah Garcia, was among those
killed. Cross, who was raising the boy as a son, was angered that
relatives weren’t told the records were being released and that it took
so long for them to be made public.</p>
<p>“If we thought we could get anything we wanted, we’d ask for a time
machine to go back … and save our children, but we can’t, so all we are
asking for is for justice, accountability and transparency, and they
refuse to give this to us,” he said.</p>
<p>Jesse Rizo, whose 9-year-old niece Jacklyn Cazares was killed in the
shooting, said the release of information Saturday reignited festering
anger because it shows “the waiting and waiting and waiting” of law
enforcement.</p>
<p>“Perhaps if they were to have breached earlier, they would have saved
some lives, including my niece’s,” he said.</p>
<p>The police response included nearly 150 U.S. Border Patrol agents and
91 state police officials, as well as school and city police. While
terrified students and teachers called 911 from inside classrooms,
dozens of officers stood in the hallway trying to figure out what to do.
Desperate parents who had gathered outside the building pleaded with
them to go in.</p>
<p>The gunman, 18-year-old Salvador Ramos, entered the school at 11:33
a.m., first opening fire from the hallway, then going into two adjoining
fourth-grade classrooms. The first responding officers arrived at the
school minutes later. They approached the classrooms, but then retreated
as Ramos opened fire.</p>
<p>At 12:06 p.m., much of the radio traffic from the Uvalde Police
Department was still focused on setting up a perimeter around the school
and controlling traffic in the area, as well as the logistics of keeping
track of those who safely evacuated the building. They’ve had trouble
setting up a command post, one officer tells his colleagues, “because we
need the bodies to keep the parents out.”</p>
<p>“They’re trying to push in,” he says.</p>
<p>At 12:16 p.m., someone with the Texas Department of Public Safety,
the state law enforcement agency, called police to let them know a SWAT
team was en route from Austin, about 100 kilometers away. She asked for
any information the police could give about the shooting, the suspect
and the police response.</p>
<p>“Do you have a command post? Or where do you need our officers to
go?” the caller asks.</p>
<p>The police representative responds that officers know there are
several dead students inside the elementary school and others still
hiding. Some of the survivors have been evacuated to a building nearby.
She doesn’t know if a command post has been set up.</p>
<p>At 12:50 p.m., a tactical team enters one of the classrooms and
fatally shoots Ramos.</p>
<p>Among criticisms included in a U.S. Justice Department report
released earlier this year was that there was “no urgency” in
establishing a command center, creating confusion among police about who
was in charge.</p>
<p>Multiple federal and state investigations have laid bare cascading
problems in law enforcement training, communication, leadership and
technology, and questioned whether officers prioritized their own lives
over those of children and teachers.</p>
<p>Some of the 911 calls released were from terrified instructors. One
described “a lot, a whole lot of gunshots,” while another sobbed into
the phone as a dispatcher urged her to stay quiet. “Hurry, hurry, hurry,
hurry!” the first teacher cried before hanging up.</p>
<p>Just before arriving at the school, Ramos shot and wounded his
grandmother at her home. He then took a pickup from the home and drove
to the school.</p>
<p>Ramos’ distraught uncle made several 911 calls begging to be put
through so he could try to get his nephew to stop shooting.</p>
<p>“Everything I tell him, he does listen to me,” Armando Ramos said.
“Maybe he could stand down or do something to turn himself in,” he
added, his voice cracking.</p>
<p>He said his nephew, who had been with him at his house the night
before, stayed with him in his bedroom all night, and told him that he
was upset because his grandmother was “bugging” him.</p>
<p>“Oh my God, please, please, don’t do nothing stupid,” the man says on
the call. “I think he’s shooting kids.”</p>
<p>But the offer arrived too late, coming just around the time that the
shooting had ended and law enforcement officers killed Salvador
Ramos.</p>
<p>Two of the responding officers now face criminal charges. Former
Uvalde school Police Chief Pete Arredondo and former school officer
Adrian Gonzales have pleaded not guilty to multiple charges of child
abandonment and endangerment. A Texas state trooper in Uvalde who had
been suspended was reinstated to his job earlier this month.</p>
<p>In an interview this week with CNN, Arredondo said he thinks he’s
been “scapegoated” as the one to blame for the botched law enforcement
response.</p>
<p>Some of the families have called for more officers to be charged and
filed federal and state lawsuits against law enforcement, social media,
online gaming companies, and the gun manufacturer that made the rifle
the gunman used.</p>
